Using linkage analysis, we mapped the gene underlying FTC to 2q24-q31. This region includes the gene GALNT3, which encodes a glycosyltransferase responsible for initiating mucin-type O-glycosylation. Sequence analysis of GALNT3 identified biallelic deleterious mutations in all individuals with FTC, suggesting that defective post-translational modification underlies the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2165626582,"While the striatum has been implicated in reward processing, an alternative view contends that the striatum processes salient events in general. Using fMRI, we investigated human striatal responses to monetary reward while modulating the saliency surrounding its receipt. Money was maximally salient when its receipt depended on a correct response (active) and minimally salient when its receipt was completely independent of the task (passive). The saliency manipulation was confirmed by skin conductance responses and subjective ratings of the stimuli. Significant caudate and nucleus accumbens activations occurred following the active compared to passive money. Such activations were attributed to saliency rather than the motor requirement associated with the active money because striatal activations were not observed when the money was replaced by inconsequential, nonrewarding stimuli. The present study provides evidence that the striatum's role in reward processing is dependent on the saliency associated with reward, rather than value or hedonic feelings."

Aggregate entrance into the cytoplasm is followed by an early rise of reactive oxygen species and free Ca2+ levels and eventually by cell death. Such changes correlate directly with the viability of the cells and are not observed when cell are cultured in the presence of reducing agents or in Ca2+-free media. In addition, moderate cell stress following exposure to the aggregates was found to be fully reversible. The results show that the cytotoxicity of prefibrillar aggregates of HypF-N, a protein not associated with clinical disease, has the same fundamental origin as that produced by similar types of aggregates of proteins linked with specific amyloidoses. These findings suggest that misfolded proteinaceous aggregates stimulate generic cellular responses as a result of the exposure of regions of the structure (such as hydrophobic residues and the polypeptide main chain) that are buried in the normally folded proteins. They also support the idea that a higher number of degenerative pathologies than previously known might be considered as protein deposition diseases.

They also support the idea that a higher number of degenerative pathologies than previously known might be considered as protein deposition diseases. Approximately 20 different peptides or proteins, including the Aβ peptides, β2-microglobulin, transthyretin, lysozyme, α-synuclein, and the prion protein, are the main components of amyloid aggregates in vivo, each being associated with a specific disease such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases, type 2 diabetes, and systemic amyloidoses. In these pathologies it is likely that the impairment of cellular function is a direct consequence of the interaction of cellular components with protein aggregates that may be present, in some cases, at very low levels (1Thomas T. Thomas G. McLendon C. Sutton T. Mullan M. Nature. 1996; 380: 168-171Google Scholar, 2Pepys M.B. Wheaterall D.J. Ledingham J.G. Warrel D.A. Oxford Textbook of Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1512-1524Google Scholar). In systemic non-neuropathic diseases, however, the accumulation in tissues and organs of large amounts of amyloid deposits may in itself be the primary origin of the clinical symptoms (2Pepys M.B. Wheaterall D.J. Ledingham J.G. Warrel D.A. Oxford Textbook of Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1512-1524Google Scholar, 3Koo E.H. Lansbury P.T. Kelly J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9989-9990Google Scholar). In some cases the proteins deposited are wild-type, as in sporadic amyloidoses, and in other cases they are modified by specific genetic mutations as in early onset familial diseases (4Kelly J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Google Scholar, 5Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Google Scholar). Since 1998, an increasing number of natural or de novo designed sequences of proteins or peptides that are not associated with any known medical condition have been shown to aggregate in vitro into fibrils that are indistinguishable from those associated with the amyloid diseases (reviewed in Ref. 6Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Google Scholar). In the case of globular proteins, aggregation is found to require destabilizing conditions such that the proteins involved are at least partially unfolded but still able to form intramolecular interactions, notably those involving hydrogen bonding (7Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Google Scholar). These and other findings indicate that amyloid aggregation is a generic property of the polypeptide chain, most probably linked to the common structure of the peptide backbone (7Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Google Scholar, 8Dobson C.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 133-145Google Scholar, 9Dobson C.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 729-730Google Scholar). They also increase dramatically the number of proteins one can investigate to assess general features underlying protein misfolding and aggregation as well as the interaction of the aggregates with cells. Recently, evidence is beginning to emerge suggesting that the effects of aggregation on cellular function might be very similar for different proteins. In particular, aggregates of two proteins unrelated to disease, the SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; HypF-N, HypF N-terminal domain; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; CM-H2 DCFA, 2′,7′-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate; AM, acetoxymethylester. 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; HypF-N, HypF N-terminal domain; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; CM-H2 DCFA, 2′,7′-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate; AM, acetoxymethylester. domain from the bovine phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli HypF (HypF-N) have been investigated from this perspective. Both of these proteins form amyloid fibrils under mild denaturing conditions (10Gujiarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Google Scholar, 11Chiti F. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Taddei N. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2541-2547Google Scholar), and as observed for other amyloidogenic proteins, various prefibrillar aggregates are formed prior to the growth of mature fibrils, whose appearance often requires much longer periods of time (10Gujiarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Google Scholar, 11Chiti F. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Taddei N. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2541-2547Google Scholar). Both proteins have been found to be toxic to cells only when added to the culture media in their prefibrillar state (12Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). The findings on the cytotoxicity of the proteins that are not associated with disease are closely similar to the conclusions drawn from studies on disease-associated proteins such as the Aβ peptides, α-synuclein, and transthyretin (1Thomas T. Thomas G. McLendon C. Sutton T. Mullan M. Nature. 1996; 380: 168-171Google Scholar, 13Conway K.A. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Google Scholar); these conclusions suggest that the cytotoxicity associated with aggregation may be determined by common features of specific types of aggregates rather than by specific amino acid sequences (12Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). The latter conclusion is also supported by recent findings providing evidence that the soluble prefibrillar aggregates of a range of different peptides and proteins are all recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against a molecular mimic of soluble Aβ oligomers; the same antibodies fail to recognize the corresponding mature fibrillar aggregates, whereas they suppress the cytotoxicity of the prefibrillar aggregates (18Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the prefibrillar aggregates of proteins and peptides that form amyloid fibrils share common structural features that differ from those displayed both by their nonaggregated precursors and by the mature fibrils; they also argue against specific mechanisms of toxicity of the differing amyloid aggregates. Therefore, an increasing body of evidence supports the idea that the ability to form amyloid aggregates and the toxicity of these aggregates are generic properties of peptides and proteins. It also suggests that, in general, the most highly cytotoxic aggregates are the early prefibrillar assemblies or, possibly in some cases, the individual misfolded molecules (19Svanborg C. Agerstam H. Aronson A. Bjerkvig R. Duringer C. Fischer W. Gustafsson L. Hallgren O. Leijonhuvud I. Linse S. Mossberg A.-K. Nilsson H. Pettersson J. Svensson M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 88: 1-29Google Scholar) rather than mature fibrils. To explore in depth the fundamental origins of the cytotoxicity of early aggregates of proteins that ultimately form amyloid fibrils, we have investigated the consequence of the exposure of murine fibroblasts (NIH-3T3 cells) to prefibrillar aggregates formed from the HypF-N domain and compared the results with findings reported previously with cells exposed to peptides and proteins that are specifically associated with amyloid diseases. This study has enabled us to explore whether the mechanisms by which protein aggregation results in cellular toxicity share a common basis or are protein-specific even in the case of proteins not associated with disease. In particular, we have examined those cellular characteristics found to be perturbed by aggregates of disease-associated proteins, notably the intracellular redox status and the levels of Ca2+ ions; we have also investigated the apoptotic or necrotic status of cells following prolonged exposure to the aggregates and explored the reversibility of cell damage occurring prior to cell death. We suggest, on the basis of our findings, that the toxicity of misfolded and aggregated states of different peptides and proteins proceeds through the modification of the same specific biochemical properties in the exposed cells and that such a modification depends on the type of aggregate rather than on the specific amino acid sequence of the aggregated protein. It can therefore be predicted that the cascade of biochemical modifications triggered by the exposure of cells to any aggregated polypeptide chain ultimately leading to cell death, at least in most cases, starts with the alteration of the same cellular parameters. Reagents—Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2 DCFA), Fura2-AM, Fluo-3-AM, Texas Red STP ester sodium salt, and wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated fluorescein were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The caspase 3 assay, cell culture media, materials for microscopy analysis, and other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% bovine calf serum, unless otherwise stated and 3.0 mm glutamine in a 5% CO2 humidified environment at 37 °C. 100.0 units/ml penicillin and 100.0 μg/ml streptomycin were added to the media. The cells were used for a maximum of 20 passages. HypF-N was purified as described previously (11Chiti F. Bucciantini M. Capanni C. Taddei N. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2541-2547Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-HypF-N polyclonal antibodies were provided by Primm S.r.l. (Milan, Italy); Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Formation and Labeling of Prefibrillar Aggregates—Prefibrillar aggregates of HypF-N were obtained by incubating the protein for 48 h at room temperature at a concentration of 0.3 mg ml–1 in 30% (v/v) trifluoroethanol, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The solution was centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was dried under N2 to remove the remaining solvent, dissolved in RPMI serum-free medium, and immediately added to the culture medium of cells grown on coverslips to a final protein concentration of 20 μm. The presence of HypF-N aggregates inside cells was detected by labeling preformed aggregates with Texas Red as follows. To 1.0 mg of the protein aggregates dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, 10 μl of a 10 mg/ml Texas Red solution in Me2SO was added slowly. After 1 h at room temperature with continuous stirring, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 1.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 8.5. The cells were then counterstained with fluorescein-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (50 μg/ml) for 15 min to detect plasma membrane profiles. Coverslips containing the cells and the labeled prefibrillar aggregates were then mounted on the stage of a confocal Bio-Rad MCR 1024 ES scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with a krypton/argon laser source (15 mW) for fluorescence measurements. Observations were performed using a Nikon Plan Apo 60× oil immersion objective. Texas Red fluorescence was revealed at 568-nm excitation, and fluorescein was revealed at 488-nm excitation. A series of optical sections (512 × 512 pixels) 1.0 μm in thickness was taken through the cells at intervals of 0.8 μm. 20 optical sections for each examined sample were then projected as single composite image by superimposition. In the indirect immunofluorescence experiments, the cells were plated on glass coverslips and incubated with the prefibrillar aggregates. Then the cells were fixed in 2.0% buffered paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and blocked with a 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 3.0% glycerol solution in PBS. After washing, the coverslips were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HypF-N antibodies diluted 1:100 in PBS with bovine serum albumin for 60 min. The immunoreaction was revealed with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200. Negative controls were obtained by substituting blocking solution for the primary antibody. Counterstaining for the nuclei was performed with propidium iodide. The fluorescence was analyzed by confocal laser microscopy (Bio-Rad) using two emission lines at 488 and 568 nm for Alexa-488 and propidium iodide excitation, respectively. Assay of Cellular Toxicity—Aggregate cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT reduction inhibition assay (20Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2074-2078Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were plated on to 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well in 100 μl of fresh medium. After 24 h, the culture medium was exchanged with 100 μl of RPMI serum-free medium without red phenol. The cells were exposed to the HypF-N aggregates for differing lengths of time as previously reported (12Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). 10.0 μl of a stock MTT solution in PBS was then added to the cells to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the incubation was continued for a further 2 h. At this time, cell lysis buffer (100 μl/well; 20% SDS, 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7) was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. The absorbance of blue formazan was measured at 570 nm using an automatic plate reader as described previously (12Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed by exposing cells to solutions of the nonaggregated, monomeric protein (final concentration, 20.0 μm) for the same lengths of time. Reversibility of Cell Damage—Reversibility of cell impairment was assessed by performing the MTT assay on cells cultured in serum-free media to avoid cell duplication; the cells were incubated with a serum-free medium containing 20.0 μm of aggregated protein for different lengths of time, washed, and cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. As a control, the cells were exposed to a serum-free medium containing the same amount of soluble HypF-N. To assess the role of proteasomal involvement, the cells were treated with 10.0 μm lactacystin for varying lengths of time before incubation with a serum-free medium containing 20.0 μm of protein aggregates; at the end of the incubation period, the cells were cultured for 24 h in fresh, serum-free medium and then subjected to the MTT assay. The controls were prepared by incubating cells with lactacystin and then exposing them to 20.0 μm soluble HypF-N for the same lengths of time. Measurement of the Production of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species—Intracellular ROS assays were performed using the ROS-sensitive fluorescent probe CM-H2 DCFA. NIH-3T3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/0.8 ml/well. After 24 h, the cells were incubated in the presence of 20.0 μm aggregated protein for differing lengths of time. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and loaded with 5.0 μm CM-H2 DCFA in the culture medium for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and then lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 2.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton, 10.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 10.0 μg/ml leupeptin). ROS levels were detected in the samples by measuring the fluorescence of the oxidized CM-H2 DCFA with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 55 spectrofluorimeter (Wellesley, MA), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 520 nm, respectively). CM-H2 DCFA fluorescence into intact cells was also detected using a confocal Bio-Rad MCR 1024 ES scanning microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser source (15 mW). A series of optical sections (512 × 512 pixels) was taken through the depth of the cells with a thickness of 1.0 μm at intervals of 0.8 μm. Twenty optical sections for each examined sample were then projected as a single composite image by superimposition. The time course analysis of ROS production was performed using the software Time Course Kinetic (Bio-Rad). Measurements of Intracellular Free Ca2+ Levels—The levels of free Ca2+ present in the cytosol were measured using the fluorescent probes Fura2-AM or Fluo-3-AM (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Subconfluent plates were incubated for differing lengths of time in the presence of a solution containing 20.0 μm of protein aggregates. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10.0% fetal calf serum containing 10.0 μm Fura2-AM. To increase the effectiveness of the probe, Fura2-AM stock solutions (10 mm in dry Me2SO) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 20% pluronic acid F127 prior to addition to the cell medium. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, and then the extracellular dye was removed by washing with a large excess of 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 115 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 1.0 mm MgCl2. The cells were resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer, counted, and then diluted to a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in a spectrofluorimetric cuvette thermostatted at 25 °C. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were then calculated using standard protocols (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). In a separate set of experiments intracellular Ca2+ was imaged in intact cells using the Ca2+-sensitive probe Fluo-3 and the laser confocal microscope used for intracellular ROS imaging. The cells were cultured on collagen IV-coated glass coverslips, and dye loading was performed by incubating cells with 5.0 μm Fluo-3 for 20 min at 37 °C in the culture medium. Then the coverslips were mounted in a chamber and placed on the stage of the confocal microscope. Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored at a wavelength of 488 nm by collecting the emitted fluorescence with a Nikon Plan Apo 60× oil immersion objective through a 510-nm-long wave pass filter. The time course analysis of intracellular calcium was performed using the software Time Course Kinetic (Bio-Rad). Assays for Cell Apoptosis—The extent to which the apoptotic pathway had been triggered in 80% confluent cells exposed for 48 h to a 20 μm final concentration of HypF-N aggregates was determined by measuring caspase-3 activation using a colorimetric 96-well plate assay system (Sigma) as specified by the provider. An important question in the investigation of protein aggregate toxicity is to assess whether the effects of aggregates to cells follow aggregate internalization. We first investigated whether the prefibrillar aggregates of HypF-N added to the cell culture medium appeared in the cytoplasm, by labeling the aggregates with the fluorescent probe Texas Red. Fig. 1 shows confocal microscopy images at different focal lengths of cells exposed for 3 h to the labeled HypF-N aggregates; similar images were seen after 1 h of exposure (not shown). The aggregated species can be seen to have accumulated in the vicinity of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A) and also to be present in the intracellular focal plane (Fig. 1B, arrows). The ingress of the aggregates into the cells does not result simply from the enhanced hydrophobicity of the aggregate-Texas Red complex, because similar data were obtained using unlabeled aggregates whose presence inside cells was detected by immunofluorescence using polyclonal anti-HypF-N antibodies (Fig. 1C). This result shows that early aggregates of HypF-N added to the cell culture medium are able to be internalized, although the mechanism of aggregate translocation inside cells requires further investigation. The biochemical parameters we investigated in the cells exposed to the prefibrillar aggregates were the redox status and the intracellular free Ca2+. Fig. 2 shows the results of the experiments aimed at determining the levels of ROS that are generated within cells following exposure for 3 h to 20 μm HypF-N in both soluble and aggregated forms. A significant increase in ROS, concomitant with a decrease in cell viability as detected by the MTT assay, was found (Fig. 2A). ROS increase and cytotoxicity, however, were not present in cells incubated, prior to exposure to the aggregates, in the presence of 0.10 mm α-tocopherol (vitamin E), a lipid-soluble antioxidant that is very effective in suppressing membrane lipid peroxidation (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using propylgallate or promethazine as reducing agents (data not shown). The ROS levels after exposure to HypF-N aggregates were also determined by monitoring cells with confocal microscopy in the presence of the fluorescent probe CM-H2 DCFA. As in the experiments performed using cell lysates, a considerable increase in ROS levels was found in living cells exposed to the aggregates, whereas no ROS increase was observed when the same cells were treated with 0.10 mm α-tocopherol (Fig. 2B). These findings show that the HypF-N prefibrillar aggregates modify the redox status of cells in a manner closely similar to that previously reported for peptides and proteins that are associated with protein deposition diseases (see “Discussion”). To assess whether the HypF-N aggregates induced an increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels, cell media were supplemented with a 1:1 mixture of 10.0 μm Fura2-AM, 20% pluronic acid F127 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3A shows that intracellular Ca2+ levels rise by a factor of about 2 in cells exposed for 3 h to a 20 μm solution of aggregated protein compared with control experiments where cells were incubated in the presence of the same quantity of soluble HypF-N. This increase, along with a concomitant decrease in cell viability, as determined by the MTT test, was abolished when the cells were cultured in a Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 3A). The intracellular Ca2+ levels after exposure to the HypF-N aggregates were also monitored in vivo by confocal microscopy (see “Experimental Procedures”). A considerable increase in Ca2+ was found in cells exposed to the aggregates, whereas no increase was observed when cells were cultured in a Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 3B). These data reveal that intracellular Ca2+ levels are modified in the cells exposed to the HypF-N aggregates in a manner similar to that reported previously for cells incubated in the presence of disease-associated peptides and proteins including the Aβ peptide, human islet amylin, the amyloidogenic prion protein fragment, and Cu,Zn-SOD (see “Discussion”). Intracellular Ca2+ and ROS levels were also monitored by confocal microscopy in cells incubated in the presence of α-tocopherol prior to exposure to the HypF-N aggregates and in cells cultured in Ca2+-free medium during the time they were exposed to the aggregates, respectively. Fig. 4 shows that the ROS levels are high following exposure to aggregates even in the absence of Ca2+ in the medium. By contrast, free Ca2+ levels in cells pretreated with α-tocopherol before exposure to HypF-N aggregates were considerably lower than in cells not treated with α-tocopherol and the same as in control cells exposed to the protein in its soluble form. The substantial increase in ROS caused by the HypF-N aggregates even in the absence of Ca2+ in the medium indicates that oxidative stress is, at least in part, independent of the rise of the intracellular Ca2+ levels. This conclusion is supported by the observed time courses of both Ca2+ and ROS increases, where the ROS increase is found to precede the Ca2+ rise during the first 20 min of exposure to the aggregates (Fig. 5). However, both events occur rapidly compared with other changes in cellular functions such as apoptosis or necrosis, being almost complete after 60 min of exposure. The finding that the viability of cells cultured in Ca2+-free medium is unaffected by exposure to the HypF-N aggregates, although displaying enhanced ROS production, indicates that, at least under our conditions, oxidative stress does not by itself generate cytotoxicity. We have also investigated the degree of reversibility of the rise of both intracellular ROS and Ca2+ levels, along with the associated cell damage. The effect of preincubation of cells in the presence of lactacystin (10.0 μg/ml), a potent proteasome inhibitor, before exposure to the aggregates was also examined. Cells were cultured in serum-free medium to avoid cell division following transfer in aggregate-free fresh medium. Fig. 6 shows that cell damage appears to be almost completely reversible after exposure to the aggregates for relatively short lengths of time (less than 5 h) when the cells almost completely recover the ability to reduce MTT. For longer times of exposure (until 15 h) cells recovered viability only partially. Moreover, the cells stressed upon pretreatment with lactacystin followed by exposure to the aggregates were more susceptible to damage than were untreated cells; in this case, the reversal of the toxic effects was dependent upon the length of the time of preincubation with lactacystin. After 15 h of preincubation, the cell damage was not reversed when the cells were moved to fresh media, whereas for 5 and 3 h of preincubation, reversal was partial or complete, respectively, indicating a different degree of impairment of the mechanisms of clearance of the aggregates. It has previously been reported that, after prolonged exposure to the HypF-N aggregates, cells undergo death, as shown by the trypan blue exclusion assay (12Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). We have not investigated in detail the features of cell death under our conditions; however, we found a necrotic rather than an apoptotic condition in our cells exposed for 24 h to the aggregates (data not shown). Nevertheless, a progressive caspase-3 activation was initially present, reaching a maximum (around 250%) after 6–7 h of exposure to the aggregates, indicative of an apoptotic response (data not shown). Although preliminary, these data suggest that, in our exposed cells, the apoptotic pathway is initially triggered but is not sustained and is followed by necrotic death. A deeper investigation of the biochemical features of cell death following exposure to the toxic aggregates is presently underway. It is now well established that the aggregation process of peptides and proteins leadi"

https://openalex.org/W2138885636,"Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) are multiprotein assemblies that regulate the entry of extracellular calcium into electrically excitable cells and serve as signal transduction centers. The alpha1 subunit forms the membrane pore while the intracellular beta subunit is responsible for trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane and modulation of its electrophysiological properties. Crystallographic analyses of a beta subunit functional core alone and in complex with a alpha1 interaction domain (AID) peptide, the primary binding site of beta to the alpha1 subunit, reveal that beta represents a novel member of the MAGUK protein family. The findings illustrate how the guanylate kinase fold has been fashioned into a protein-protein interaction module by alteration of one of its substrate sites. Combined results indicate that the AID peptide undergoes a helical transition in binding to beta. We outline the mechanistic implications for understanding the beta subunit's broad regulatory role of the VDCC, particularly via the AID."

These findings are suggestive of a role for cotranslational protein-processing pathways in maintaining epithelial luminal structure and implicate noncilial ER proteins in human polycystic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1978921042,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are a class of ubiquitous cellular organelles that are involved in lipid storage and metabolism. Although the mechanisms of the biogenesis of LDs are still unclear, a set of proteins called the PAT domain family have been characterized as factors associating with LDs. Perilipin, a member of this family, is expressed exclusively in the adipose tissue and regulates the breakdown of triacylglycerol in LDs via its phosphorylation. In this study, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to examine the potential function of perilipin. We found direct interaction between perilipin and CGI-58, a deficiency of which correlated with the pathogenesis of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS). Endogenous CGI-58 was distributed predominantly on the surface of LDs in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, and its expression increased during adipocyte differentiation. Overexpressed CGI-58 tagged with GFP gathered at the surface of LDs and colocalized with perilipin.

Furthermore, we identified CGI-58 as a binding partner of ADRP, another PAT domain protein expressed ubiquitously, by yeast two-hybrid assay.

It is expected that, similar to other organelles, the protein components associated with the membrane surface would regulate the dynamics of LDs. Indeed, a specific set of proteins called the PAT domain family consisting of four members (perilipin, ADRP, TIP47, and S3–12) that share a conserved region at the N terminus (except for S3–12 carrying the region at the C terminus) have been identified as factors associated with the surface of LDs (5Miura S.

Hence, it is expected that partners of PAT proteins in the cells help with the functions. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is a well-characterized partner of perilipin. Perilipin basically blocks the access of HSL to LDs in quiescent adipocytes and thus restricts the lipolytic activity. On the other hand, under conditions of lipolysis, perilipin is multiphosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and facilitates the access of HSL to LDs, thereby promoting lipolysis (8Sztalryd C.

In contrast, HSL-null mice displayed relatively mild phenotypes, not being obese, but retaining about half of the wild-type level of triacylglycerol lipase activity (22Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T.

Moreover, an in vitro study using cell lines lacking endogenous HSL showed that the knockout lines still had a significant level of lipolytic activity (24Okazaki H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Yahagi N.

These studies indicate that perilipin is a major regulator of lipolysis, and several other cofactors including HSL participate in this event. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of lipolysis, it is necessary to identify the proteins cooperating with perilipin. In this study, we found that CGI-58 (comparative gene identification-58), which is known as a causal gene of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS), interacts with perilipin as well as ADRP, on the surface of LDs. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A Zucker rat adipose tissue cDNA library (DupLEX-A, OriGene), constructed in a pJG4–5 plasmid encoding the B42 activation domain was subjected to yeast two-hybrid screening for an interactor. cDNAs of perilipin and ADRP were obtained from mouse adipocyte total RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and subcloned into a bait vector pEG202-NLS encoding the LexA DNA-binding domain. Part of the sequence of perilipin (corresponding to amino acid residues 1–250) was subcloned into pEG202-NLS. The plasmid was introduced into the yeast strain EGY48, and screening was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. From 4.7 × 106 transformants, Leu+ colonies were selected through growth on agar plates lacking leucine, and verified by galactose-dependent lacZ expression. Plasmids were recovered from the yeast cells and sequenced. Several positive clones were isolated, one of them containing a fulllength cDNA sequence similar to Riken 1300003D03, which was judged to be a rat homolog of human CGI-58. HSP86 was isolated as another positive clone. For the screening of an interactor for ADRP, the fulllength sequence of ADRP was subcloned into pEG202-NLS and subjected to screening as described above. From 3.3 × 107 transformants, several positive clones were isolated. Some of the clones were isolated multiple times independently; four clones encoded the C-terminal region of IRG-47, four other clones were similar to Riken 1300003D03. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells were maintained as described previously (26Tominaga S. Morikawa M. Osumi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For differentiation, confluent cells (day 0) were treated with a hormone mixture containing 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 5 μg/ml insulin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose)/10% fetal calf serum. After 48 h (day 2), the mixture was removed, and cells were maintained in the same medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml of insulin. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F12/10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids—Because some of the yeast two-hybrid clones contained a full-length CGI-58 cDNA, the entire open reading frame of rat CGI-58 was amplified by PCR, and subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The cDNA was transferred to a GFP expression vector, phGFP (105), encoding a GFP mutant that has an increased brightness (27Yamasaki M. Hashiguchi N. Fujiwara C. Imanaka T. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35293-35296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using appropriate restriction sites. A series of truncation or point mutations of CGI-58 were generated by PCR or employing appropriate restriction sites, and subcloned into phGFP (105). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. For the bacterial expression of GST- and T7-tagged proteins, cDNA fragments were inserted into pGex-KG (28Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) and pET21 (Novagen) Antibodies—An antibody was raised in a rabbit against GST-fused full-length rat CGI-58 expressed in Esherichia coli. The antibody was affinity-purified with Hi-Trap NHS-activated columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with GST and GST-CGI-58. Guinea pig polyclonal anti-perilipin, anti-ADRP and mouse monoclonal anti-ADRP antibodies were purchased from Progen. Rabbit anti-lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) was a gift from Dr. Usuda. A monoclonal antibody to the T7 tag was obtained from Invitrogen. Immunodetection of CGI-58—3T3-L1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dissolved in the heated SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Rat adipose tissue was homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the affinity-purified CGI-58 antibody, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Amounts of proteins were estimated using LDH as an internal control. DNA Transfection and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—3T3-L1 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the expression vectors encoding the GFP-fused full-length or mutants of CGI-58. Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's directions. After transfection for 24 h, cells were fixed with cold methanol for 2 min for ADRP staining, or PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature for perilipin staining. Fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Cells were then incubated with primary polyclonal antibodies against ADRP and perilipin for 1 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were mounted and observed under a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). For the detection of endogenous CGI-58, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (day 3) were double immunostained with antiperilipin and affinity-purified anti-CGI-58, followed by appropriate Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). CHO-K1 cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate method as described previously (29Osada S. Tsukamoto T. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Osumi T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with cold methanol for 2 min and then treated as described above. A monoclonal antibody for ADRP (Progen) was used for the immunodetection. RT-PCR—The procedures were as described previously (26Tominaga S. Morikawa M. Osumi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was mixed with a downstream primer mixture (10 pmol each) in a total volume of 20 μl, and RT was carried out for 1 h at 43 °C with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After RT, PCR was performed with 2 μl of the RT product as a template, 10 pmol each of the upstream and downstream primers and recombinant TaqDNA polymerase (TaKaRa). PCR products were analyzed with a 2% agarose gel, and determined in a fluorescence imaging analyzer, FLA3000 (Fuji). GST Pull-down Experiment—Recombinant GST-fused proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose (28Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The amounts of the recombinant proteins were standardized on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. T7-tagged mouse perilipin and ADRP were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using an expression vector, pET21. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A). After the addition of Triton X-100 at 0.5%, lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant containing a T7-tagged protein was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads containing 15 μg of different GST-fused proteins. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with a binding buffer (PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100), and resuspended in 100 μl of the SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples (20 μl each) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody. Immunoblots were developed using ECL. For the binding experiment with native perilipin and the GST-CGI-58 fusion protein, the total 3T3-L1 cell homogenate was used as the source of perilipin. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (day 5) were washed with PBS and harvested in binding buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was used as a sample for the GST pull-down experiment. Identification of CGI-58 as a Binding Partner of Perilipin and ADRP—Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we screened a rat adipose tissue cDNA library with mouse perilipin as bait. The part of perilipin (residues 1–250) used was common to isoforms A, B, and C, and contained the entire PAT domain and subsequent β-sheet region (30Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Several clones, which were strongly positive for both growth on agar plates without leucine and galactose-dependent lacZ expression, were isolated, and the cDNAs sequenced. One of the clones was 86.3% identical to human CGI-58 (GenBank™ AL606838), and 96.0% identical to mouse RIKEN cDNA 1300003D03 (BC037063) assumed to be a CGI-58 homolog. Thus, we judged this clone to be the rat CGI-58. It encoded the entire putative rat CGI-58, a protein of 351 amino acid residues. Furthermore, we also performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with the full-length mouse ADRP as bait, using the same library. CGI-58 was again isolated among the positive clones. Two of four CGI-58 clones obtained in this screening encoded the entire protein sequence. The two other clones lacked the region corresponding to the N-terminal 6 and 12 amino acids but encoded the remaining region up to the C terminus. CGI-58 has been reported as a causal gene for CDS [MIM 275630]) (32Lefèvre C. Jobard F. Caux F. Bouadjar B. Karaduman A. Heilig R. Lakhdar H. Wollenberg A. Verret J.L. Weissenbach J. Özgüc M.

CDS is a rare autosomal recessive form of nonbullous congenital ichtyosiform erythroderma (NICE) and is characterized by the intracellular accumulation of LDs in many types of tissues (33Rozenszajn L. Klajman A. Yaffe D. Efrati P. Blood. 1966; 28: 258-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chanarin I. Patel A. Slavin G. Wills E.J. Andrews T.M. Stewart G. Br. Med.

The CGI-58 protein sequence is largely conserved from rodents to humans (Fig. 1A). It belongs to a large protein family defined by a α/β hydrolase fold (36Schrag J.D. Cygler M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and contains sequences highly conserved among members of the esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily (36Schrag J.D. Cygler M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, as compared with the conserved sequence motif of lipases (LLGHSLGG), the serine residue that is part of the catalytic triad is replaced by asparagine in the corresponding region of CGI-58 (LLGHNLGG; underlined in Fig. 1A). In Vitro Binding of CGI-58 to Perilipin and ADRP—To confirm the interactions found in yeast two-hybrid screening, we performed GST pull-down analyses. Total lysate of bacteria expressing recombinant epitope-tagged perilipin or ADRP, the full-length or C-terminally truncated form was applied to glutathione-agarose beads containing GST alone or a GST-fused version of the full-length rat CGI-58. Both the full-length and truncated perilipin and ADRP bound to GST-CGI-58 but not GST alone (Fig. 1B). These findings in vitro support the interaction of CGI-58 with perilipin and ADRP and suggest that the C-terminal regions of perilipin and ADRP are not critical for the binding. Endogenous CGI-58 Is Principally Located on the Surface of LDs in Differentiated 3T3-L1 Cells—In order to characterize the endogenous CGI-58, an antibody was raised against the recombinant fusion protein expressed in bacteria. The antibody generated was affinity-purified and used in an immunoblot analysis of total protein from rat adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 cells. We expected the antibody to react with both the rat and mouse CGI-58, based on the sequence conservation (only two amino acids differ). The antibody recognized a single protein in the adipose tissue lysate at a position of ∼45 kDa (Fig. 2A), which was somewhat larger than the estimated size of rat CGI-58 (39.1 kDa). However, the CGI-58 expressed from a mammalian expression vector was also detected with this antibody, as a band of apparently larger size, close to 45 kDa (data not shown). Thus, we consider that this band indeed represented CGI-58, and the slower electrophoretic mobility would be a characteristic of the protein. On the blot of 3T3-L1 lysate, interestingly, we observed a dramatic change in the protein expression upon adipocyte differentiation. For the lysates prepared from the cells on day 0 (before differentiation), we did not detect any band with the anti-CGI-58 antibody. In contrast, for the cell lysates on day 5 (about 60% of cells differentiated), the antibody detected several bands (Fig. 2B). The major band (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 2B) corresponded to the one detected for the rat adipose tissue lysate (confirmed by another blot where lysates were electrophoresed side by side; data not shown). Other bands were much fainter than the major one. Although they are possibly nonspecific, another explanation would be the presence of alternative splicing variants of CGI-58. Indeed, based on a data base analysis in AceView of NCBI, several variants of human CGI-58 are predicted. These results indicate that protein expression of CGI-58 is induced upon adipocyte differentiation. We next determined the subcellular localization of CGI-58 in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells by the indirect immunofluorescence method. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were fixed and double immunostained with the anti-CGI-58 and anti-perilipin antibodies (Fig. 2C). Endogenous CGI-58 mainly displayed a cytoplasmic ring-shaped distribution, similar to that of perilipin, suggesting that CGI-58 is colocalized with perilipin on the surface of LDs. CGI-58 was also expressed with a diffuse pattern in the cytosol (Fig. 2C), where perilipin was absent. When non-differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were immunostained for CGI-58, no fluorescence was detected (data not shown). CGI-58 mRNA Level Increased in the Early Stage of Adipocyte Differentiation—We next followed the change in the mRNA level of CGI-58 during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, in comparison with that of PAT proteins and adipose protein/fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), a marker for adipogenesis (37Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). A ribosomal protein, 36B4, was used as an internal control, unaffected by the differentiation. RT-PCR was performed using total RNA prepared from cells on the indicated days, 0 to 8. Before differentiation (day 0), CGI-58 mRNA was expressed at a low level, whereas after induction, the mRNA level increased immediately (day 1), and remained constant during the course of the differentiation (Fig. 3). This result was consistent with that for the CGI-58 protein expression (see Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the results for perilipin, ADRP, and aP2 were all consistent with those of a previous report (10Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J.

ADRP showed an initial decrease in mRNA level, followed by a large increase from a relatively early stage of differentiation (10Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA level of S3–12 increased from day 3 and continued to rise, nearly corresponding to the increase in protein described before (15Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37713-37721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These results indicate that CGI-58 mRNA increases at an initial stage of differentiation, prior to the increases in PAT protein mRNAs. Thus, CGI-58 is possibly regulated by a mechanism distinct from that of PAT proteins. In addition, we noticed that TIP47 (putative mouse sequence, AK004970) was the only PAT domain protein unaltered in its mRNA expression during the differentiation, and so likely to be functionally unrelated to adipogenesis. Ectopically Expressed CGI-58 Is Recruited to LDs in 3T3-L1 Cells—To elucidate the mechanisms behind the localization of CGI-58 to LDs, we first examined whether ectopic CGI-58 was correctly recruited to LDs similar to the endogenous protein. We introduced an expression vector with GFP fused to the full-length CGI-58 into differentiated 3T3-L1 cells and compared the distribution of the fusion protein and perilipin using immunofluorescence microscopy. GFP-CGI-58 showed a ringshaped subcellular distribution, overlapping with perilipin detected by the specific antibody (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when GFP-CGI-58 was expressed in the non-differentiated cells, a punctate distribution was observed over the cytoplasmic fluorescence, being colocalized with ADRP (Fig. 4B). In contrast, GFP per se distrib"
https://openalex.org/W2054632884,"Telomere length in humans is partly controlled by a feedback mechanism in which telomere elongation by telomerase is limited by the accumulation of the TRF1 complex at chromosome ends. TRF1 itself can be inhibited by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity of its interacting partner tankyrase 1, which abolishes its DNA binding activity in vitro and removes the TRF1 complex from telomeres in vivo. Here we report that the inhibition of TRF1 by tankyrase is in turn controlled by a second TRF1-interacting factor, TIN2 (ref. 6). Partial knockdown of TIN2 by small hairpin RNA in a telomerase-positive cell line resulted in telomere elongation, which is typical of reduced TRF1 function. Transient inhibition of TIN2 with small interfering RNA led to diminished telomeric TRF1 signals. This effect could be reversed with the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide and did not occur in cells overexpressing a PARP-dead mutant of tankyrase 1. TIN2 formed a ternary complex with TRF1 and tankyrase 1 and stabilized their interaction, an effect also observed with the PARP-dead mutant of tankyrase 1. In vitro, TIN2 protected TRF1 from poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrase 1 without affecting tankyrase 1 automodification. These data identify TIN2 as a PARP modulator in the TRF1 complex and can explain how TIN2 contributes to the regulation of telomere length."
https://openalex.org/W2012940954,"Native ion channels are precisely tuned to their physiological role in neuronal signaling. This tuning frequently involves the controlled assembly of heteromeric channels comprising multiple types of subunits. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels of olfactory neurons are tetramers and require three types of subunits, CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1b, to exhibit properties necessary for olfactory transduction. Using fluorescently tagged subunits and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we find the subunit composition of heteromeric olfactory channels in the surface membrane is fixed, with 2:1:1 CNGA2:CNGA4:CNGB1b. Furthermore, when expressed individually with CNGA2, CNGA4 and CNGB1b subunits were still present in only a single copy and, when expressed alone, did not self-assemble. These results suggest that the precise assembly of heteromeric olfactory channels results from a mechanism where CNGA4 and CNGB1b subunits have a high affinity for CNGA2 but not for self-assembly, precluding more than one CNGA4 or CNGB1b subunit in the channel complex."

Within the vascular endothelium, nitric oxide (NO) is generated via the enzyme endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). 1The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; WT, wild-type. This highly labile and reactive gas plays a key role in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis, influencing systemic and pulmonary blood pressure, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis. Given the important and pervasive action of endothelium-derived NO in the cardiovascular system, it is not surprising that the activity of eNOS is highly regulated in a temporal and spatial manner (1Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar). eNOS was originally characterized as a calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme (2Singer H.A. Peach M.J.

It is now generally accepted that eNOS activity is also influenced directly by regulated protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation and indirectly by fatty acylation, which targets the enzyme to specific intracellular domains (1Fulton D.

The ability of both Akt-phosphorylated and S1179D eNOS (a constitutively active allele in which Ser1179 is mutated to an aspartate reside) to release more NO in the absence of a stimulus has led to the proposal that phosphorylation of Ser1179 mediates the calcium-independent activation of eNOS (7Fulton D.

Phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 has been observed in the Golgi complex and in the plasma membrane of endothelial cells; however, due to the presence of eNOS in both locations, the individual functions of Golgi versus plasmalemmal eNOS, if any, are not yet known and are matter of mere speculation (30Fulton D.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the individual function of eNOS in the cytoplasmic aspect of the Golgi complex and plasma membrane using molecular targeting with organelle-restricted “zip codes” to deliver functional eNOS to specific intracellular sites and to examine whether eNOS targeted to endomembranes is functionally responsive to extracellular stimuli.

By exploiting these properties of G2A eNOS, we generated Golgi complex- and plasma membrane-targeted eNOS to assess the functional importance of subcellular targeting (Fig. 1). To determine whether the eNOS fusion proteins target their intended destinations, indirect immunofluorescence for eNOS and GM130, a resident peripheral Golgi protein, was performed in transfected COS cells. As shown in Fig. 2, WT eNOS was present in both the plasma membrane (WT-eNOS, left panel, arrows) and the Golgi complex (arrowhead), co-localizing with the Golgi marker GM130 (right panel, arrowhead), whereas G2A eNOS was diffusely distributed throughout the cell (G2A-eNOS, left panel) and did not specifically co-localize with GM130 (right panel). Targeting of eNOS to the Golgi complex with the GRIP domain was confirmed by the presence of eNOS concentrated in a perinuclear pattern (GRIP-eNOS, left panel), but it was also found in a pattern reminiscent of post-Golgi vesicles with the absence of plasma membrane staining. GRIP-eNOS partially co-localized with the Golgi marker GM130 (right panel). Similarly, fusion of eNOS with the syntaxin-3 cis/medial-Golgi complex-targeting motif (Syn17-eNOS) demonstrated Golgi targeting (S17-eNOS, left panel) and partial co-localization with GM130 and no plasma membrane staining (right panel). Fusion of eNOS to the full-length transmembrane domain of syntaxin-3 (Syn25-eNOS) resulted in dramatic plasma membrane staining, with minor amounts present in the Golgi complex (S25-eNOS, left panel). Membrane targeting of eNOS with the CAAX motif derived from K-Ras (CAAX-eNOS) also showed the majority of eNOS in the plasma membrane (CAAX-eNOS, left panel). Thus, using these targeting motifs, eNOS was targeted to the peripheral aspect of the Golgi network (GRIP-eNOS and Syn17-eNOS) or the plasma membrane (Syn25-eNOS and CAAX-eNOS). Previous studies have shown that WT and G2A eNOS have similar catalytic abilities and cofactor requirements (38Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ.

Therefore, we measured the catalytic competency of the newly generated eNOS fusion proteins in vitro using the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline as an index of NOS activity in detergent-solubilized COS cell extracts. COS cells do not contain any endogenous NOS isoform, and all activity measurements were eliminated by the NOS inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. The activity of GRIP-eNOS was slightly greater than that of WT eNOS (89.7 ± 2.7 and 72.8 ± 5.5 pmol of l-citrulline/mg/min, respectively; n = 3). In a separate series of transfectants, Syn17-eNOS, Syn25-eNOS, and CAAX-eNOS exhibited slightly lower catalytic activities compared with WT eNOS (25.4 ± 0.6, 20.8 ± 1.5, 14.3 ± 0.5, and 32.9 ± 1 pmol of l-citrulline/mg/min, respectively; n = 3). These differences in activity were not due to expression differences as assessed by semiquantitative Western blotting of the same extracts. Plasma Membrane Targeting of eNOS Results in Marked NO Release due to Constitutive Phosphorylation of Ser1179—To determine the relevance of intracellular location to eNOS function in intact cells, COS cells were transfected with the various eNOS constructs, and basal NO release was determined by NO-specific chemiluminescence. Cells were subsequently lysed and immunoblotted for total eNOS or phosphorylated eNOS species using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (Ser(P)1179, Thr(P)497, Ser(P)617, Ser(P)635). As shown in Fig. 3, non-acylated cytosolic G2A eNOS displayed both significantly reduced NO release (A, graph) and hypophosphorylation of Ser1179 (A) Thr497 (B), and Ser617 and Ser635 (C) compared with WT eNOS (upper gels). On the other hand, the plasma membrane-targeted forms of eNOS fusion proteins (Syn25-eNOS and CAAX-eNOS) produced substantially more basal NO than did WT eNOS, with equivalent levels of eNOS protein expression. As shown in Fig. 3A (upper and lower gels), the level of Ser1179 phosphorylation was also much greater in the plasma membrane-targeted forms of eNOS relative to the WT enzyme. Localization of eNOS to the peripheral aspects of the Golgi network produced divergent results. Restricted localization of eNOS to the trans- and post-Golgi vesicles via the GRIP targeting motif (GRIP-eNOS) resulted in reduced basal NO release compared with the WT enzyme. In contrast, fusion of eNOS to the syntaxin-3 cis-Golgi complex-targeting motif (Syn17-eNOS) produced equivalent amounts of basal NO compared with the WT enzyme. These changes in NO release did not strictly correlate with basal phosphorylation of Ser1179 since GRIP-eNOS and Syn17-eNOS phosphorylation was comparable with WT eNOS phosphorylation, but was again greater than G2A eNOS phosphorylation. We next investigated the relative degree of eNOS phosphorylation of the other regulatory phosphorylation sites. Thr497 phosphorylation is important for the fidelity of eNOS to produce NO versus superoxide since phosphorylation promotes NO release, whereas dephosphorylation promotes superoxide anion production (18Lin M.I.

Phosphorylation of Ser617 and Ser635 regulates temporal aspects of calcium/calmodulin regulation of the enzyme (17Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Kemp B.E. Jo H. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, WT eNOS and plasma membrane-targeted eNOS (Syn25-eNOS and CAAX-eNOS) exhibited enhanced Thr497 phosphorylation relative to G2A eNOS and the Golgi complex-targeted eNOS constructs. The phosphorylation of Ser617 was similarly distributed, with the greatest degree of phosphorylation observed with the WT and plasma membrane-targeted eNOS constructs. Low levels of Ser617 phosphorylation were observed with cytosolic G2A eNOS and eNOS fusion proteins that target the Golgi network (GRIP-eNOS and Syn17-eNOS). GRIP-eNOS displayed the highest level of Ser635 phosphorylation, followed by WT eNOS and plasma membrane-targeted eNOS (CAAX-eNOS and Syn25-eNOS). Syn17-eNOS (cis-Golgi complex-targeted) was found to have significantly lower phosphorylation of Thr497, Ser635, and Ser617 (Fig. 3, B and C). Plasma Membrane-targeted eNOS Is Highly Sensitive to Transmembrane Calcium Fluxes—Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA, elevates intracellular calcium through store depletion, which in turn triggers calcium influx via capacitive calcium entry (41Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The elevation of intracellular calcium is a key determinant of eNOS activation via the increased association of calcium-activated calmodulin. As shown in Fig. 4A, thapsigargin evoked release of substantially more NO from COS-7 cells transfected with plasma membrane-targeted forms of eNOS (Syn25-eNOS and CAAX-eNOS) compared with cells expressing WT eNOS or Golgi complex-restricted eNOS (GRIP-eNOS and Syn17-eNOS). Compared with the WT enzyme, calcium-dependent activation of cytosolic G2A eNOS resulted in the production of significantly less NO, whereas both trans-Golgi-localized GRIP-eNOS and cis/medial-Golgi targeting with Syn17-eNOS were not significantly different from that with WT eNOS. Golgi Targeting with Syn17-eNOS Is Required for Akt-dependent Activation of eNOS—As stated previously, eNOS can be activated via Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Ser1179 (7Fulton D. Gratton J.P.

Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, cotransfection of WT eNOS with cDNA for Akt-1 resulted in the increased phosphorylation of Ser1179 (upper gels) and enhanced production of NO (graph). Previous work has shown that this effect is abolished if Ser1179 is mutated to alanine (7Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). Fatty acylation and subcellular targeting are required for full activation, as Akt stimulated significantly less NO production (graph) and Ser1179 phosphorylation (upper gels) with cytosolic G2A eNOS versus the WT enzyme. Although a significant increase in NO release was observed in the presence of Akt, this was not greater than the unstimulated levels for the WT enzyme (Fig. 4B, graph). Transfection with Akt did not stimulate statistically significant NO production from GRIP-eNOS; however, restricted cis/medial-Golgi localization with Syn17-eNOS enabled full Akt-dependent activation of eNOS as determined by NO release and phosphorylation of Ser1179 to levels seen with WT eNOS. Plasma membrane-targeted eNOS constructs (CAAX-eNOS and Syn25-eNOS) exhibited constitutive NO release and phosphorylation of Ser1179. In contrast to WT eNOS and Syn17-eNOS, cotransfection with Akt did not stimulate further production of NO or influence the phosphorylation state of Ser1179. Phosphorylation of Ser1179 Is Required for the Activation of Golgi Complex- and Plasma Membrane-restricted eNOS—The ability of Akt to increase eNOS activity is dependent on the specific phosphorylation of Ser1179, and mutation of this site to the phospho-mimetic aspartic acid is sufficient to increase NO release from eNOS in the absence of additional stimuli (7Fulton D.

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of SHP-2 signaling, therefore, rests upon the identification of its target substrates. In this report, we have used SHP-2 substrate-trapping mutants to identify the major vault protein (MVP) as a putative SHP-2 substrate. MVP is the predominant component of vaults that are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes of unknown function. We show that MVP is dephosphorylated by SHP-2 in vitro and it forms an enzyme-substrate complex with SHP-2 in vivo. In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), SHP-2 associates via its SH2 domains with tyrosyl-phosphorylated MVP. MVP also interacts with the activated form of the extracellular-regulated kinases (Erks) in response to EGF and a constitutive complex between tyrosyl-phosphorylated MVP, SHP-2, and the Erks was detected in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Using MVP-deficient fibroblasts, we demonstrate that MVP cooperates with Ras for optimal EGF-induced Elk-1 activation and is required for cell survival.

The coordinated actions of PTKs and PTPs are crucial for the regulation of a multitude of physiological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, migration, adhesion, immune response, cell survival, and apoptosis. Although there is overwhelming evidence to demonstrate a critical role for PTPs in the regulation of cellular physiology, a detailed molecular understanding of the actions of many of these enzymes remains to be determined. In large part, the lack of a precise molecular basis for how PTPs function has stemmed from the difficult task of identifying their substrates. The SH2 domain-containing PTP, SHP-2, is an ubiquitously expressed PTP that has two SH2 domains at the NH2 terminus, a PTP domain, and a COOH-terminal tail (1Feng G.-S. Hui C.-C. Pawson T.

Further evidence in mammalian systems for a positive signaling role for SHP-2 has been obtained from mice containing a targeted deletion within exon 3 of murine SHP-2 that deletes the NH2 terminus SH2 domain (5Saxton T.M.

The ability of SHP-2 to transduce downstream signals in such a diverse manner stems, at least in part, from its capacity to participate in a multitude of protein-protein interactions.

In addition, such interactions with SHP-2 also serve to localize it within close proximity to its substrate. Substrates for SHP-2 have been reported previously.

Despite the identification of these SHP-2 substrates, it is still unclear as to how SHP-2-mediated dephosphorylation propagates positive signaling. Although recently, it has been suggested that SHP-2 signals positively by either negatively regulating GTPase-activating proteins leading to the activation Ras and Rho (27Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. Mol.

In this report, we describe the identification and functional characterization of MVP as a novel substrate for SHP-2. MVP is conserved evolutionarily and constitutes the predominant component of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes called vaults (29Scheffer G.L. Wijngaard P.L. Flens M.J.

The function of the vault organelle remains unknown, although MVP has been found to be overexpressed in many chemoresistant cancer cells and tumors (32Mossink M.H. van Zon A. Scheper R.J. Sonneveld P. Wiemer E.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7458-7467Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We show that when MVP is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to EGF, both SHP-2 and the Erks complex with MVP. MVP also exhibits properties similar to that of other known MAPK scaffold proteins. Our data provide the first functional evidence for MVP as we show that MVP facilitates EGF-dependent transcriptional activation and is required for cell survival. Cell Culture—Human WI38 lung fibroblasts and 293 human embryonic kidney fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin.

MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS in the presence of antibiotics. Spontaneously immortalized MEFs were derived from wild type embryos (MVP+/+) and embryos that contained a homozygous deletion of MVP (MVP–/–) (34Mossink M.H. van Zon A. Franzel-Luiten E. Schoester M.

Plasmids and Transient Transfections—GST fusion proteins of SHP-2 PTP domain (PTP-WT), PTP domain containing a mutation at Cys459 to Ser459 (PTP-CS), were generated by PCR amplifying amino acids 218–528 of either wild type SHP-2 or SHP-2 containing a mutation at Cys459 to Ser459.

GST-SHP-2-EA was constructed by PCR amplifying SHP-2-Glu76 to Ala76 (EA) described previously (35Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3875-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and subcloning the product into pGEX-2TK. The NH2-SH2 and COOH-SH2 domains of SHP-2 from amino acids 1–215 (GST-N+C-SH2) have been described previously (36Hausdorff S.F. Bennett A.M. Neel B.G. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12965-12968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MVP was cloned into the mammalian vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) by reverse transcriptase-PCR using template cDNA isolated from WI38 fibroblasts. WI38-derived cDNA was PCR-amplified using a forward primer that was engineered to contain a HindIII site prior to the start codon (5′-GGATGAAGCTTCACCATGGCAACTGAAGAGTTC-3′) and a reverse primer containing a KpnI site following the FLAG (DYKDDDDK) tag and a stop codon (5′-GGAGGGTACCTTACTTATCATCATCATCCTTGTAATCGCGCAGTAC-3′). The PCR product of the carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged MVP was subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ mammalian expression vector using the restriction sites HindIII and KpnI to yield pcDNA3.1-MVP-FLAG (MVP-FLAG). Myc-tagged pIRES-GFP-SHP-2-WT (SHP-2-WT) and pIRES-GFP-SHP-2-C459S (SHP-2-CS) have been previously described (35Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3875-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). pIRES-GFP-SHP-2-D425A (SHP-2-DA) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pIRES-GFP-SHP-2-WT as template. All constructs and products generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The vector pDCR and activated H-Ras (pDCR-H-Ras(V12)) were obtained from Dr. Linda VanAelst (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). 293 cell transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 4 h. 293 cells were then placed in complete medium containing 10% FBS for 20 h, prior to serum-deprivation for 24 h. 293 cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with either 20 or 100 ng/ml EGF (Calbiochem). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification of Substrate-trapped Proteins—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (37Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins used in the MVP dephosphorylation assay were eluted from the Sepharose matrix by adding 2 bed volumes of the elution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm glutathione (pH 8.0), and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubating for 1 h at 4 °C. SHP-2 substrate-trapped proteins were isolated by large scale affinity purification with GST-PTP-DA from 200 150-mm plates of WI38 fibroblasts. WI38 fibroblasts were first rendered quiescent and then pretreated with 50 μm pervanadate for 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm iodoacetic acid. A total starting yield of ∼500 mg of WI38 lysates was isolated which was subjected to a preclearing step with GST-PTP-WT for 1 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecific PTP interacting proteins. Following preclearing, supernatants were neutralized with 10 mm dithiothreitol and then incubated with GST-PTP-DA for a further 1 h at 4 °C. These affinity complexes were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer and were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were visualized by staining with Brilliant Blue-G colloidal stain (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were excised from the polyacrylamide gel, washed in 50% acetonitrile, followed by 50% acetonitrile, 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were dried and digested (0.1 μg/15-mm3 gel) with modified trypsin (Promega) in 10 mm ammonium molybdate. Digested proteins were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization by time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) on a Bruker OmniFLEX™ mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA). For vanadate competition experiments, ∼10 μg of GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins were preincubated with 10 mm Na3VO4 for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then resuspended in PBS prior to use in affinity precipitation experiments. WI38 lysates were incubated with GST fusion proteins for 3 h and washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer without iodoacetic acid and then with ST buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm Na3VO4. Cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation experiments with the respective antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C and then incubated further for 1 h with either protein G- or protein A-Sepharose blocked in 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and then once with ST buffer before boiling in sample buffer and separation by 8% SDS-PAGE. Mouse monoclonal anti-MVP (Calbiochem) and anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) were used at 0.2 μg/mg lysates and 2.0 μg/mg lysates for immunoprecipitating MVP and FLAG-tagged MVP, respectively. Polyclonal antibody to SHP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 3 μg/ml for immunoprecipitation. Tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at a 1:2,000 dilution. Mouse monoclonal anti-LRP/MVP (BD Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-SHP-2 (BD Transduction Laboratories), polyclonal anti-Erk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-phospho-Erk (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies were all used at a 1:1,000 dilution for immunoblotting. A rabbit polyclonal anti-MVP antibody that was kindly provided by Dr. Wiemer (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Primary antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminesence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturers instructions using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies raised against either mouse or rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:5,000 dilution. Elk-1 Transactivation Assays—Cells were co-transfected with the 0.5 μg of Elkc-Gal4, 0.5 μg of 5X-Gal4-luciferase, and 50 ng of pRL-SV40 Renilla for 24 h and serum-deprived for an additional 24 h prior to stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 4 h. The cells were lysed, and Elkc-mediated luciferase and Renilla activities were measured using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Confocal Immunoflorescence Microscopy—WI38 fibroblasts were plated onto coverslips and serum-deprived for 24 h. Cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 90 min. Slides were prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (38Pusl T. Wu J.J. Zimmerman T.L. Zhang L. Ehrlich B.E. Berchtold M.W. Hoek J.B. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Bennett A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27517-27527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Primary anti-MVP or anti-SHP-2 antibodies were visualized using antimouse Alexa fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:250. Confocal microscopic images were acquired using a C-Apochromat 63×/1.2W objective and version 3.2 software on LSM510 META confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). In Vitro MVP Tyrosyl Dephosphorylation—The specific phosphatase activity of GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins were determined using para-nitrophenylphosphate as described previously (35Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3875-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tyrosyl-phosphorylated MVP was immunoprecipitated from serum-deprived MCF-7 cells lysed in RIPA buffer using anti-MVP antibodies. The immune complexes were first washed in wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) twice in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4) followed by two washes in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. The immune complexes were washed in ST buffer and then once in phosphatase assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). MVP immune complexes were incubated with equal concentrations of either GST alone, GST-SHP-2-WT, GST-SHP-2-EA, or PTP-WT in the absence or presence of 10 mm Na3VO4 at 37 °C for 45 min. The immune complexes were then washed once in the wash buffer containing 10 mm Na3VO4, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with 4G10 antibodies to detect for the amount of phosphotyrosyl content on MVP. These immunoblots were re-probed to determine the amount of MVP in these immune complexes. Densitometric analysis was performed on tyrosyl-phosphorylated MVP, which was normalized to total MVP ascertained from the re-probe of the immunoblot. Densitometric analysis was performed using Labworks™ analysis software (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). Cell Death Assays—MVP+/+ and MVP–/– MEFs were serum-deprived for different time periods, and both the non-adherent and adherent cells were collected and assessed for trypan blue staining. MVP+/+ and MVP–/– MEFs were also subjected to FACS analysis upon propidium iodide staining as described previously (13Zito C.I. Kontaridis M.I. Fornaro M. Feng G.S. Bennett A.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Identification of a Tyrosyl-phosphorylated p100 SHP-2 Substrate-trapped Protein as the MVP—In an attempt to identify substrates for SHP-2, we generated GST fusion proteins encoding the substrate-trapping Cys to Ser (CS) and the Asp to Ala (DA) mutations within the PTP domain of SHP-2 (Fig. 1A). Since SHP-2 contains two SH2 domains, tyrosyl-phosphorylated substrates could potentially interact not only in a SH2-dependent manner but also via a substrate-trapping interaction. Thus, to ensure that only tyrosyl-phosphorylated substrates were isolated by the substrate-trapping mutants, the SH2 domains of SHP-2 were deleted (Fig. 1A). The positive role for SHP-2 in growth factor signaling has led to a model in which its substrates undergo tyrosyl dephosphorylation following growth factor stimulation (10Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Thus, potential SHP-2 substrates should be tyrosyl-phosphorylated prior to growth factor receptor activation. Therefore, to enrich for these substrates, WI38 human fibroblasts were rendered quiescent and then treated with pervanadate to prevent protein tyrosyl dephosphorylation. Lysates prepared from these cells were incubated with either GST-PTP-WT or substrate-trapping fusion proteins, GST-PTP-CS and GST-PTP-DA (Fig. 1A), and affinity complexes were immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. We found that whereas GST alone and GST-PTP-WT affinity precipitations exhibited undetectable levels of complexed tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins, both GST-PTP-CS and GST-PTP-DA fusion proteins precipitated tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins of 100 kDa (p100) and 80 kDa (p80) (Fig. 1B). Although the p80 protein precipitated with both GST-PTP-CS and GST-PTP-DA, it did so with less efficiency than the p100 protein. Because of this, the p100 protein was selected for further analysis. To identify the tyrosyl-phosphorylated p100 SHP-2 substrate-trapped protein, we scaled up, by ∼60-fold, the affinity precipitation experiment described in Fig. 1B. Fig. 1C (left panel) shows the initial repertoire of tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins present in lysates prepared from quiescent pervanadate-treated WI38 cells prior to affinity purification. These lysates were subjected to affinity precipitation using GST-PTP-WT and GST-PTP-DA. The resultant affinity complexes isolated using GST-PTP-WT and GST-PTP-DA are shown in Fig. 1C (right panel). GST-PTP-DA, but not GST-PTP-WT, trapped the p100 protein, which was readily discernable by colloidal blue staining. This p100 protein was isolated and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by MALDI-TOF spectroscopy. The masses of the tryptic digested peptides were queried against the Swiss-Prot database, which returned a match identifying p100 as the human MVP, which also is known as the lung resistance-related protein (Fig. 1D). If the phosphotyrosyl-containing p100 protein was interacting in a manner dependent upon the formation of an active site intermediate, then this interaction should be disrupted by the PTP catalytic site inhibitor vanadate. To test this and to further confirm that the p100 tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein is indeed MVP, we carried out affinity precipitation assays using either GST-PTP-DA or GST-PTP-DA preincubated with 10 mm vanadate. These affinity complexes were immunoblotted with anti-MVP antibodies. Fig. 1E shows that GST-PTP-DA formed an enzyme-substrate complex with p100, which exhibited immunoreactivity to anti-MVP antibodies. Moreover, the p100/MVP substrate-trapped protein was disrupted from its interaction with GST-PTP-DA by vanadate (Fig. 1E). Although shown to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated in the electric ray (39Herrmann C. Volknandt W. Wittich B. Kellner R. Zimmermann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13908-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), no evidence exists as to whether MVP is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in mammalian systems. Therefore, MVP was immunoprecipitated from untreated and pervanadate-treated WI38 cells, and anti-MVP immune complexes were immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1F, MVP was tyrosyl-phosphorylated in pervanadate-treated WI38 cells, consistent with the notion that MVP may serve as a SHP-2 substrate. SHP-2 Dephosphorylates MVP in Vitro and Forms a Substrate-trapped Complex with MVP in Vivo—To further characterize MVP as a substrate for SHP-2, we next asked if SHP-2 directly dephosphorylates MVP in vitro. GST fusion proteins of full-length wild type SHP-2 (GST-SHP-2-WT), an activated SHP-2 mutant (GST-SHP-2-EA) (35Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the PTP domain alone (GST-PTP-WT) were generated. The specific activities of these GST proteins were verified using para-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate (Fig. 2A). Tyrosyl-phosphorylated MVP was immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cells and incubated with equal amounts of GST, GST-SHP-2-WT, GST-SHP-2-EA or GST-PTP-WT. Wild type SHP-2 exhibited a low basal level of PTPase activity (Fig. 2A) because it assumes an inactive confirmation and thus a minimal effect on tyrosyl dephosphorylation of MVP was observed (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the constitutively active mutant of SHP-2 (GST-SHP-2-EA) that assumes an active confirmation independently of SH2 domain engagement exhibited ∼10-fold higher levels of PTPase activity than wild type SHP-2 (Fig. 2A) and was capable of dephosphorylating MVP by ∼70% relat"
https://openalex.org/W2075151598,"The array of vibrissae on a rat's face is the first stage of a high-resolution tactile sensing system. Recently, it was discovered that vibrissae (whiskers) resonate when stimulated at specific frequencies, generating several-fold increases in motion amplitude. We investigated the neural correlates of vibrissa resonance in trigeminal ganglion and primary somatosensory cortex (SI) neurons (regular and fast spiking units) by presenting low-amplitude, high-frequency vibrissa stimulation. We found that somatosensory neurons showed band-pass tuning and enhanced sensitivity to small amplitude stimuli, reflecting the resonance amplification of vibrissa motion. Further, a putative somatotopic map of frequency selectivity was observed in SI, with isofrequency columns extending along the representations of arcs of vibrissae, in agreement with the gradient in vibrissa resonance across the vibrissa pad. These findings suggest several parallels between frequency processing in the vibrissa system and the auditory system and have important implications for detection and discrimination of tactile information."
https://openalex.org/W2039538170,"Cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are thought to be tetrameric assemblies of CNGB3 (B3) and CNGA3 (A3) subunits. We have used functional and biochemical approaches to investigate the stoichiometry and arrangement of these subunits in recombinant channels. First, tandem dimers of linked subunits were used to constrain the order of CNGB3 and CNGA3 subunits; the properties of channels formed by B3/B3+A3/A3 dimers, or A3/B3+B3/A3 dimers, closely resembled those of channels arising from B3+A3 monomers. Functional markers in B3/B3 (or A3/A3) dimers confirmed that both B3 subunits (and both A3 subunits) gained membership into the pore-forming tetramer and that like subunits were positioned adjacent to each other. Second, chemical crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation studies using epitope-tagged monomer subunits both demonstrated the presence of two CNGB3 subunits in cone channels. Together, these data support a preferred subunit arrangement for cone CNG channels (B3-B3-A3-A3) that is distinct from the 3A:1B configuration of rod channels."
https://openalex.org/W1985164519,"Structural and functional analyses of alginate lyases are important in the clarification of the biofilm-dependent ecosystem in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in the development of therapeutic agents for bacterial disease. Most alginate lyases are classified into polysaccharide lyase (PL) family-5 and -7 based on their primary structures. Family PL-7 enzymes are still poorly characterized especially in structural properties. Among family PL-7, a gene coding for a hypothetical protein (PA1167) homologous to Sphingomonas alginate lyase A1-II was found to be present in the P. aeruginosa genome. PA1167 overexpressed in Escherichia coli cleaved glycosidic bonds in alginate and released unsaturated saccharides, indicating that PA1167 is an alginate lyase catalyzing a β-elimination reaction. The enzyme acted preferably on heteropolymeric regions endolytically and worked most efficiently at pH 8.5 and 40 °C. The specific activity of PA1167, however, was much weaker than that of the known alginate lyase AlgL, suggesting that AlgL plays a main role in alginate depolymerization in P. aeruginosa. In addition to this specific activity, differences were found between PA1167 and AlgL in enzyme properties such as molecular mass, optimum pH, salt effect, and substrate specificity. The first crystal structure of the family PL-7 alginate lyase was determined at 2.0 Å resolution. PA1167 was found to form a glove-like β-sandwich composed of 15 β-strands and 3 α-helices. The structural difference between the β-sandwich PA1167 of family PL-7 and α/α-barrel AlgL of family PL-5 may be responsible for the enzyme characteristics. Crystal structures of polysaccharide lyases determined so far indicate that they can be assigned to three folding groups having parallel β-helix, α/α-barrel, and α/α-barrel + antiparallel β-sheet structures as basic frames.

PA1167 is the fourth novel folding structure found among polysaccharide lyases. Polysaccharide lyases recognize uronic acid residues in polysaccharides and catalyze a β-elimination reaction by releasing unsaturated saccharides with C=C double bonds at nonreducing terminal uronate residues. These characteristics of lyases indicate that they share common structural features determining their uronate-recognition sites and reaction modes (β-elimination reaction). Based on their primary structures, polysaccharide lyases are classified into 14 families (PL 1The abbreviations used are: PL, polysaccharide lyase; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; MIR, multiple isomorphous replacement. 1The abbreviations used are: PL, polysaccharide lyase; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; MIR, multiple isomorphous replacement.-1–14), each of which also includes various function-unknown proteins that have sequence homology in the Carbohydrate-Active enZYme (CAZY) data base (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html).

No three-dimensional structures for family PL-2, -4, -7, and -11–14 lyases have been solved, however, and little information exists on structural rules common to polysaccharide lyases. Alginate is a linear polysaccharide consisting of α-l-guluronate and its C5 epimer, β-d-mannuronate, arranged in three different ways: poly-α-l-guluronate (poly(G)), poly-β-d-mannuronate (poly(M)), and heteropolymeric (poly(MG)) regions (Fig. 1, A–C) (10Gacesa P. Carbohydr. Polym. 1988; 8: 161-182Google Scholar). Alginate produced by brown seaweed is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries due to its ability to chelate metal ions and to form a highly viscous solution, whereas some pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce alginate, which is involved in pathogenicity (11Onsøyen E. Carbohydr. Eur. 1996; 14: 26-31Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that thrives in diverse environments such as soil, plant, and animal tissues due to its ability to assimilate a large number of organic compounds (12Hardalo C. Edberg S.C. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 47-75Google Scholar). The bacterium is also known to cause opportunistic infections in humans (13Bodey G.P. Bolivar R.N. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Google Scholar). In the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis, it is the most predominant bacterium (60–90%). Many antimicrobial agents have been used to repress bacterial growth in cystic fibrosis (14Kulczycki L.L. Murphy T.M. Bellanti J.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1978; 240: 30-34Google Scholar), but the appearance of drug-resistant bacteria and the toxicity of agents, especially in older people, have decreased the usefulness of such treatment. Mucoid cells of P. aeruginosa produce an alginate biofilm, a capsule-like exopolysaccharide containing no poly(G) region, which is responsible for both chronic pulmonary infection and respiratory difficulties in cystic fibrosis (15Eftekhar F. Speert D.P. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2788-2793Google Scholar, 16May T.B. Shinabarger D. Maharaj R. Kato J. Chu L. DeVault J.D. Roychoudhury S. Zielinski N.A. Berry A. Rothmel R.K. Mirsa T.K.

Bacterial alginate plays an important role in the colonization of target cells by P. aeruginosa, so the biosynthesis of alginate in the bacterium has been well characterized and documented (18Rehm B.H.A. Valla S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 48: 281-288Google Scholar, 19Chitnis C.E. Ohman D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 583-590Google Scholar). The importance of alginate metabolism has drawn attention because transfer of the bacterium from one colonization site to another, which is induced by a change in environmental or nutritional conditions, requires depolymerization of the alginate biofilm (20Costerton J.W. Stewart P.S. Greenberg E.P. Science. 1999; 284: 1318-1322Google Scholar). Alginate lyase cleaves glycosidic bonds in alginate through a β-elimination reaction and produces unsaturated saccharides with a double bond between C4 and C5 sites in the nonreducing terminal sugar (Fig. 1, A–C). The enzyme is thus applicable to useful biochemicals for the analysis of biofilm-dependent ecosystems in P. aeruginosa and for establishment of an effective therapy for bacterial disease. In a study to substantiate our proposal that the use of Sphingomonas alginate lyases (A1-I (65 kDa), A1-II (25 kDa), and A1-III (40 kDa)) as biofilm-degrading enzymes together with antimicrobial agents may be feasible for therapy for P. aeruginosa infectious disease (21Yoon H.-J. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Okamoto M. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 84-90Google Scholar, 22Sakakibara H. Tamura T. Suzuki T. Hisano T. Abe S. Murata K. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 91: 1191-1199Google Scholar), the gene coding for a hypothetical protein (PA1167) of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was found to be homologous to that for alginate lyase A1-II. PA1167 is one of nine function-unknown proteins categorized into family PL-7. Based on their primary structures, alginate lyases are grouped into three families, PL-5, -7, and -14. Most of the family PL-5 and -7 alginate lyases specifically depolymerize poly(M) and poly(G), respectively, although family PL-14 contains enzymes specific for poly(M) or poly(G). P. aeruginosa alginate lyase (AlgL, PA3547) categorized into family PL-5 has been characterized functionally (23Schiller N.L. Monday S.R. Boyd C.M. Keen N.T. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4780-4789Google Scholar, 24Wong T.Y. Preston L.A. Schiller N.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 289-340Google Scholar), and we have clarified the structure/function relationship of family PL-5 alginate lyase A1-III (5Yoon H.-J. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 505-514Google Scholar, 25Yoon H.-J. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Murata K. Mikami B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 9-16Google Scholar). Structural and functional analyses of family PL-7 alginate lyases together with family PL-5 enzymes are thought to be important in clarifying the biofilm-dependent ecosystem in P. aeruginosa, for the development of therapeutic agents for bacterial disease, and for the establishment of common structural features and catalytic mechanisms of alginate lyases. Family PL-7 alginate lyases show no homology with other family lyases, suggesting that family PL-7 enzymes exhibit a novel folding distinct from the three types of lyase thus far analyzed. This article identifies and characterizes the novel alginate lyase PA1167 (family PL-7) from P. aeruginosa PAO1 and determines the structure of the enzyme by x-ray crystallography. Sodium alginate from Eisenia bicyclis (average molecular weight, 25,700; viscosity, 1,000 centipoises) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. Poly(M) (M, 95.1%, G, 4.9%), poly(G) (M, 6.1%; G, 93.9%), and poly(MG) (M, 53.2%; G, 46.8%) were prepared from brown seaweed alginate as described elsewhere (26Haug A. Larsen B. Smidsrød O. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 32: 217-225Google Scholar). CM-Toyopearl 650M, DEAE-Toyopearl 650M, butyl-Toyopearl 650M, and SuperQ-Toyopearl 650S were purchased from Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan. Sephacryl S-200HR was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan, and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Toyobo Co., Tokyo, Japan. To find P. aeruginosa proteins homologous to alginate lyases specific for poly(G), the FASTA program, assisted by GenomeNet on the internet, was used for a sequence similarity search, and the ClustalW program was used for multiple sequence alignment (www.genome.ad.jp/). P. aeruginosa PAO1 and 8830 were gifts from Dr. A. Markaryan (University of Illinois College of Medicine); Escherichia coli [BL21(DE3)pLysS] (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as the host for overexpression of PA1167 and AlgL. For purification of proteins expressed in E. coli, cells were aerobically precultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C. When turbidity reached 0.4 at 600 nm, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture at a concentration of 0.1 mm, and the culture was continued at 16 °C for 42 h. To introduce PA1167 and AlgL genes into an expression vector, pET3a (Novagen, Madison, WI), a PCR was conducted using KOD polymerase (Toyobo Co, Tokyo, Japan), genomic DNA isolated from P. aeruginosa PAO1 as a template, and two synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. Oligonucleotides for PA1167 were 5′-CCCATATGCCTGACCTGAGTACCTGGAAC-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCTCATTGATGGCTAACGCGCAGC-3′ with NdeI and BamHI sites added to their 5′ regions, and those for AlgL had 5′-GCCATATGGCCGACCTGGTACCCCCGCCC-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCTCAACTTCCCCCTTCGCGGCT-3′ with NdeI and BamHI sites added to their 5′ regions. PCR conditions recommended by the KOD polymerase manufacturer (Toyobo Co., Tokyo, Japan) were used. Fragments amplified through PCR were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated with NdeI- and BamHI-digested pET3a. Resultant plasmids containing PA1167 genes were designated pET3a-PA1167 and those containing AlgL were designated pET3a-AlgL. Nucleotide sequences of PA1167 and AlgL genes amplified by PCR were determined by dideoxy chain termination using an automated DNA sequencer (model 377, Applied Biosystems Division, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Subcloning, transformation, and gel electrophoresis were conducted as described elsewhere (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The assay for alginate lyase was conducted as follows. In each assay, reaction products were confirmed to increase proportionally with time and enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture. The enzyme was incubated at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (100 μl) consisting of 0.025% sodium alginate and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was terminated by immersing the test tube in boiling water for 5 min, and then a 50-μl portion of the mixture was used for the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method (29Weissbach A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 705-709Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 548 nm arising from the condensation of β-formyl-pyruvic acid and TBA (molar absorption coefficient ϵ = 29.0 × 103m-1 cm-1) (Fig. 1D). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 μmol of β-formyl-pyruvic acid per min at 37 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as the standard, or by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using a 1-cm path length cuvette, assuming that A280 = 1.64 (PA1167) and 1.74 (AlgL) correspond to 1 mg/ml. Unless otherwise specified, all procedures were conducted at 0–4 °C. Purification of PA1167—E. coli cells harboring pET3a-PA1167 were grown in 6 liters of LB medium (1.5 liters/flask), collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 6.0), containing 1 mm EDTA, and were then resuspended in the same buffer. Cells were ultrasonically disrupted (Insonator model 201M, Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) at 0 °C and 9 kHz for 20 min, and the clear solution obtained on centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min was used as the cell extract. After supplementation with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 μm pepstatin A, the cell extract was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate (0–30% saturation) containing the enzyme was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min and then dialyzed against 20 mm KPB (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm EDTA overnight. The enzyme solution was applied to a CM-Toyopearl 650M column (2.6 by 9.5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm KPB (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.7 m) in 20 mm KPB (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm EDTA (150 ml), with a 3-ml fraction being collected every 3 min. Active fractions, which were eluted at about 0.4 m NaCl, were combined and concentrated to about 6 ml by ultrafiltration using Centriprep (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa; Millipore). The concentrate was applied to a Sephacryl S-200HR column (2.6 by 65 cm) equilibrated previously with 20 mm KPB (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.15 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with the same buffer, with a 3-ml fraction being collected every 5 min. The enzyme was eluted in fraction numbers 79–88. These fractions were combined and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm KPB (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialysate was used as purified PA1167. Purification of AlgL—E. coli cells harboring pET3a-AlgL were grown in 6 liters of LB medium (1.5 liters/flask), collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, washed with 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0), and then resuspended in the same buffer. Cells were ultrasonically disrupted (Insonator model 201M, Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) at 0 °C and 9 kHz for 20 min, and the clear solution obtained on centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min was used as the cell extract. After supplementation with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 μm pepstatin A, the cell extract was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column (2.6 by 17 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.7 m) in 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0) (300 ml), with a 3-ml fraction being collected every 5 min. Active fractions, which were eluted at about 0.4 m NaCl, were combined and saturated with ammonium sulfate (30%). The enzyme was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (2.6 by 7 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0), saturated with ammonium sulfate (30%), and eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (30 to 0% saturation) in 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0) (140 ml). Two-milliliter fractions were collected every 2 min. Active fractions, which were eluted with ammonium sulfate at less than 3%, were combined and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the dialysate was applied to a SuperQ-Toyopearl 650S column (1.6 by 4 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The enzyme was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and concentrated to about 3 ml by ultrafiltration using Centriprep (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa; Millipore). The concentrate was applied to a Sephacryl S-200HR column (2.6 × 65 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with the same buffer, with a 3-ml fraction being collected every 5 min. The enzyme was eluted in fraction numbers 66–73. These fractions were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm KPB (pH 7.0) overnight. The dialysate was used as purified AlgL. SDS-PAGE was conducted to confirm purity (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Alginate lyases A1-II and A1-III of Sphingomonas sp. A1 were purified from recombinant E. coli cells as described elsewhere (21Yoon H.-J. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Okamoto M. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 84-90Google Scholar). Products derived from alginate through the reaction of PA1167 were separated by TLC using a solvent system of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:2:2, v/v). Products were visualized by heating TLC plates at 130 °C for 5 min after spraying with 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid in ethanol. Unsaturated saccharides on TLC plates were stained with TBA as described elsewhere (32Warren L. Nature. 1960; 186: 237Google Scholar). Standard alginate di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides, with molecular weights of 352, 528, and 704, were prepared as described elsewhere (33Hashimoto W. Okamoto M. Hisano T. Momma K. Murata K. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1998; 86: 236-238Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of PA1167 purified from E. coli cells was determined by Edman degradation with a Procise 492 protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems Division, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PA1167 was crystallized at 20 °C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion as described elsewhere (34Yamasaki M. Moriwaki S. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1499-1501Google Scholar). The structure of PA1167 was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). PA1167 crystals were soaked in solutions containing several heavy atom compounds such as 5 mm PrCl3, 2 mm Sm2(SO4)3, 5 mm LuCl3, 5 mm CdCl2, 2 mm KAuCl4, and 10 mm K2PtCl4 for 0.5–2 h at 20 °C. All heavy atom solutions were prepared in 2.0 m sodium chloride and 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). Crystals were mounted in a thin walled glass capillary for x-ray analysis. Both ends of the capillary were sealed with wax after one end was filled with the mother liquor. Diffraction data for native crystals up to 2.8 Å and for derivative crystals around 3.5 Å were collected with a Bruker Hi-Star multiwire area detector at 7 °C with FTS air-cooling system, using CuKα radiation generated by a MAC Science M18XHF rotating anode generator, and were processed, merged, and scaled with the SADIE and SAINT software packages (Bruker, Karlsruhe Germany). The precession image indicated that the crystal belongs to a space group of P21. Two molecules were included in the asymmetric unit. MIR phasing was conducted with a PHASES program package (35Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Google Scholar). An electron density map was made with the solvent-flattened MIR phase using data from 15.0 to 3.5 Å, and the map was averaged using noncrystallographic symmetry. The initial model built using an averaged MIR map at 3.5 Å resolution was refined by simulated annealing with molecular dynamics using a CNS program package (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Then several rounds of restrained least squares refinement, followed by manual model building using the program TURBO-FRODO (AFMB-CNRS, France), were conducted to improve the initial model on to the R-factor value of 27.5% at 2.8 Å resolution. Diffraction data for the following refinement were collected in the resolution range between 50 and 1.9 Å by using synchrotron radiation of wavelength 0.9 Å at the BL-41XU station of SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan, as described elsewhere (34Yamasaki M. Moriwaki S. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1499-1501Google Scholar). Data obtained were processed, merged, and scaled using program package HKL 2000 (DENZO and SCALEPACK) (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar), and truncated with the CCP4 program package. The model refined at 2.8 Å was further refined by simulated annealing with molecular dynamics using a CNS program package. Several rounds of restrained least square refinement to a resolution of 2.0 Å, followed by manual modeling, were conducted to improve the model. We then added 298 water molecules having more than 3σ on the Fo - Fc map to the model. The final model was determined with an R-factor value of 18.7% (free R-factor = 24.0%) for 30,777 reflections with F > 2σ(F) at 50–2.0 Å resolution. The stereo quality of the model was assessed using the programs PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and WHAT-CHECK (39Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Google Scholar). Ribbon plots were prepared using the programs MOLSCRIPT (40Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (41Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa produces the periplasmic alginate lyase AlgL, which is specific for poly(M) (42Linker A. Evans L.R. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 958-964Google Scholar) and belongs to family PL-5. Gene coding for the alginate lyase responsible for depolymerization of other blocks (poly(G) and/or poly(MG)) in alginate was screened in the genome of P. aeruginosa. In a homology analysis with the FASTA program, a hypothetical protein (PA1167) of P. aeruginosa PAO1 showed slight homology with a family PL-7 alginate lyase (A1-II) of Sphingomonas sp. A1 specific for poly(G) (36.1% identity in a 233-aa overlap; GenBank™ accession number AB011415) (21Yoon H.-J. Hashimoto W. Miyake O. Okamoto M. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 84-90Google Scholar). In the Pseudomonas genome project data base, the PA1167 gene is categorized into a family composed of function-unknown genes, although PA1167 belongs to family PL-7 in the CAZY data base. Since no report has been made on the presence of a family PL-7 alginate lyase in P. aeruginosa, and the structure/function relationship of family PL-7 alginate lyases remains to be clarified, PA1167 was analyzed functionally and structurally. After the construction of plasmids containing genes coding for PA1167 (pET3a-PA1167) and AlgL (pET3a-AlgL), the accuracy of nucleotide sequences of genes was confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). Transformants with plasmids (pET3a-PA1167 and pET3a-AlgL) of BL21(DE3)pLysS with no alginate lyase activity were grown at 16 °C in LB broth in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 0.1 mm for the induction of gene expression. The cell extract of the E. coli transformant with pET3a-PA1167 exhibited alginate lyase activity, suggesting that PA1167 is an alginate lyase. PA1167 and AlgL were purified 14.0- and 10.4-fold from cell extracts of the E. coli transformant with activity yields of 3.7 and 15.3% (Table I), although the specific activity of PA1167 was about 34-fold lower than that of AlgL. Purified enzymes were confirmed to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2).Table IPurification of PA1167 and AlgL from E. coli cellsStepaPurification procedures are detailed under “Experimental Procedures”Total proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgmilliunitsmilliunits/mg%-foldPA1167Cell extract3,8487,5281.961001.00Ammonium sulfate (0–30%)3411,2683.7216.81.90CM-Toyopearl 650M18.443823.85.8212.1Sephacryl S-200HR10.227927.43.7114.0AlgLCell extract1,04993,49189.11001.00DEAE-Toyopearl 650M20755,44026859.33.01Butyl-Toyopearl 650M43.716,20937117.34.16SuperQ-Toyopearl 650S27.916,10257717.26.48Sephacryl S-200HR15.414,25892615.310.4a Purification procedures are detailed under “Experimental Procedures” Open table in a new tab Because AlgL has already been well characterized (23Schiller N.L.

Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2355-2359Google Scholar), only the properties of the purified PA1167 are given, as follows. Molecular Weight—The molecular mass of PA1167 was determined to be 25 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). This was comparable with the theoretical value (25,120 Da) deduced from the predicted amino acid sequence of the enzyme. On permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-200HR, the enzyme was eluted as a protein with a molecular mass of about 25 kDa (data not shown), indicating the enzyme is monomeric. pH and Temperature—PA1167 was most active at pH 8.5 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (Fig. 3A) and at 40 °C (Fig. 3B); 80% of enzyme activity was lost on preincubation at 45 °C for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (Fig. 3C). Effect of Salts—Although the production and enzyme activity of AlgL are significantly enhanced in the presence of salts such as 0.2 m NaCl (23Schiller N.L. Monday S.R. Boyd C.M. Keen N.T. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4780-4789Google Scholar), the enzyme activity of PA1167 was not affected by this salt (0.2 m NaCl) (data not shown). Substrate Specificity—Because alginate has three block structures (poly(M),"
https://openalex.org/W2040919102,"Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) is an oocyte-expressed member of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily and is required for normal ovarian follicle development and female fertility. GDF9 acts as a paracrine factor and affects granulosa cell physiology. Only a few genes regulated by GDF9 are known. Our microarray analysis has identified gremlin as one of the genes up-regulated by GDF9 in cultures of granulosa cells. Gremlin is a known member of the DAN family of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists, but its expression and function in the ovary are unknown. We have investigated the regulation of gremlin in mouse granulosa cells by GDF9 as well as other members of the TGF-β superfamily. GDF9 and BMP4 induce gremlin, but TGF-β does not. In addition, in cultures of granulosa cells, gremlin negatively regulates BMP4 signaling but not GDF9 activity. The expression of gremlin in the ovary was also examined by in situ hybridization. A distinct change in gremlin mRNA compartmentalization occurs during follicle development and ovulation, indicating a highly regulated expression pattern during folliculogenesis. We propose that gremlin modulates the cross-talk between GDF9 and BMP signaling that is necessary during follicle development because both ligands use components of the same signaling pathway.

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; GDF, growth differentiation factor; TFG-β, transforming growth factor β; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-formaldehyde; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PMSG, pregnant mare serum gonadotropin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT, reverse transcription; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin. 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; GDF, growth differentiation factor; TFG-β, transforming growth factor β; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-formaldehyde; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PMSG, pregnant mare serum gonadotropin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RT, reverse transcription; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin. and growth differentiation factors (GDFs) constitute the largest subgroup of the TGF-β superfamily of secreted growth factors (1Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Google Scholar). Many of the ligands are expressed throughout embryogenesis as well as in adult tissues, reflecting the diversity of their biological activities. BMPs were first characterized as growth factors that cause de novo bone synthesis in non-skeletal sites (2Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Google Scholar, 3Wozney J.M. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 160-166Google Scholar). Subsequent work has demonstrated that they are multifunctional proteins involved in mesoderm formation, limb development, branching morphogenesis, germ cell development, cardiac development, and female fertility, among other functions (1Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Google Scholar, 4Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Google Scholar). BMPs are secreted dimeric proteins that bind to membrane-bound receptor serine-threonine kinases (5Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Google Scholar). The type I and type II receptors, in turn, phosphorylate cytoplasmic SMAD proteins that act as transcription factors to regulated down-stream target genes (6Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Google Scholar). GDF9 is a TGF-β-related protein necessary for female fertility (7Dong J. Albertini D.F. Nishimori K. Kumar T.R. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 531-535Google Scholar, 8Elvin J.A. Yan C. Wang P. Nishimori K. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1018-1034Google Scholar). Although Gdf9 knock-out mice arrest at the primary follicle stage, in vitro studies have shown that GDF9 signaling is also critical during ovulation. During ovulation, GDF9 induces cumulus cell expansion, an inflammation-like process that involves the mucification of the cells surrounding the oocyte. This process binds the cumulus cells to the oocyte, protecting the oocyte during follicular extrusion and assisting in sperm binding and fertilization. Cumulus cell expansion partly involves the production of hyaluronic acid, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), pentraxin 3, and tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 6 (9Joyce I.M. Pendola F.L. O'Brien M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10288-10293Google Scholar). Ovarian follicles produce a number of TGF-β-related proteins in addition to GDF9 during folliculogenesis: BMP6 and BMP15 are co-expressed in the oocyte with GDF9 (16Elvin J.A. Yan C. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 1-5Google Scholar); anti-Mullerian hormone, TGF-βs, activins, and inhibins are produced from the granulosa cells; and BMP4, BMP7, and TGF-βs are synthesized from the thecal cells (8Elvin J.A.

Rev. 2004; 25: 72-101Google Scholar). In addition, granulosa cells express most of the cell surface binding receptors, including BMPR2, ACVR2, ACVR2B, TGFBR2, and AMHR2. GDF9, BMP15, BMP4, and BMP7 all use BMPR2 as a binding receptor (21Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 304-310Google Scholar, 22Vitt U.A. Mazerbourg S. Klein C. Hsueh A.J.

A. 1995; 92: 7632-7636Google Scholar). The type I receptor ALK6 has also been shown to mediate signaling of those ligands as well (21Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 304-310Google Scholar, 22Vitt U.A. Mazerbourg S. Klein C. Hsueh A.J. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 473-480Google Scholar, 24ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Sampath T.K. Reddi A.H. Estevez M. Riddle D.L. Ichijo H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16985-16988Google Scholar). It is presently unclear how granulosa cells discriminate between signals from multiple ligands that bind to the same receptor complexes. Several high-affinity binding proteins antagonize BMP signaling, including follistatin, noggin, chordin/SOG, and members of the DAN family, including DAN, cerberus, and gremlin (25Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Google Scholar, 26Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Google Scholar, 27Avsian-Kretchmer O. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1-12Google Scholar). Their primary mode of inhibition occurs by binding to the ligand, which prevents the association with the receptor complex (28Zimmerman L.B. De Jesus-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Google Scholar, 29Groppe J. Greenwald J. Wiater E. Rodriguez-Leon J. Economides A.N. Kwiatkowski W. Baban K. Affolter M. Vale W.W. Belmonte J.C. Choe S. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 2003; 85: 52-58Google Scholar). The extracellular antagonists are often part of negative feedback loops and thus are directly up-regulated by the ligands that they antagonize (25Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Google Scholar). Although follistatin is highly expressed in the mouse ovary, the expression of other negative regulatory factors in the ovary is unknown. During a screen for GDF9-regulated genes, we discovered that gremlin was up-regulated in GDF9-treated preovulatory granulosa cells. During ovulation, gremlin expression is up-regulated in cumulus cells and down-regulated in mural granulosa cells, and our in vitro data demonstrate that, although both GDF9 and BMP4 induce gremlin, gremlin selectively blocks BMP signaling and not GDF9 signaling. We hypothesize that during ovulation this distinction drives mural granulosa cells toward eventual luteinization, whereas cumulus cells undergo cell expansion through GDF9 signaling. Animals—All experimental animals were maintained in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experiments used 19–21-day-old CD1 female mice (Baylor College of Medicine). Mice were injected intraperitoneally for the indicated times with 5 IU of PMSG (Gestyl) (Diosynth Biotechnology, Oss, Holland) to stimulate follicular growth. After 48 h, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 IU of hCG (Pregnyl) (Diosynth Biotechnology) for the indicated times to induce ovulation and luteinization. Recombinant Mouse GDF9 Production and Recombinant Ligands— Recombinant mouse GDF9-conditioned medium was produced from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (14Elvin J.A. Clark A.T. Wang P. Wolfman N.M. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1035-1048Google Scholar). Control-conditioned medium was produced from Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the parent plasmid. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). All experimental GDF9 and control media were serum-free, except the medium used for microarrays (see below). For collection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 containing 5% crystalline grade bovine serum albumin (Serologicals Protein Inc., Kankakee, IL) and collected every 72 h. Following final collection, the medium was concentrated 10-fold on a tangential flow concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the amount of GDF9 was quantified by immunoblotting and comparison to a standard curve of purified Escherichia coli-produced recombinant standard. GDF9-containing medium and control-conditioned medium were treated identically throughout the process. Recombinant human BMP4 was a gift of Wyeth (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant mouse gremlin was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For experiments with cell cultures treated with gremlin, ligands were incubated for 30 min with recombinant gremlin before being added to cultures. Cell Cultures—Granulosa cells were isolated from large antral follicles from CD1 mice that had been treated with PMSG for 48 h before collection as described (14Elvin J.A. Clark A.T. Wang P. Wolfman N.M. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1035-1048Google Scholar). These cells represent a mixture of both mural and cumulus granulosa cells and are referred to generically as “granulosa cells” in the text. Animals were 21–23 days old at the time of cell collection. 4 × 105 cells/well were plated in 12-well tissue culture dishes in 0.5% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.7 pg/ml selenium (ITS-A, Invitrogen), and 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were treated immediately on harvesting, unless indicated in the text. For microarray experiments, cells were treated with control-conditioned medium or 200 ng/ml GDF9-conditioned medium that contained 1% FBS. All other experiments were performed with serum-free conditioned media. Microarray Analysis—cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Biotinylated antisense cRNA was prepared using the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was separated from unincorporated ribonucleotides using a Chroma Spin-100 column (BD Biosciences) and subsequently precipitated. RNA collected from a single experiment was used for array analysis (n = 1). Array data were compared with array data from previous independent experiments that used the same treatment protocols. Previous microarrays (10Varani S. Elvin J.A. Yan C. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1154-1167Google Scholar) would not have identified gremlin as a target because it was not present on the GeneChips (Affymetrix, Mu11K and Mu19K) used in those experiments. The Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays (MG_U74Av2) containing oligonucleotide probes corresponding to ∼12,500 full-length annotated genes and expressed sequence tag sequences were hybridized, washed, and scanned using Affymetrix equipment and protocols. Sample loading and variations in staining were standardized by scaling the average of the fluorescent intensities of all genes on an array to constant target intensity for all arrays used. Data analysis was conducted using Microarray Suite version 5.0 (Affymetrix) following user guidelines. The signal intensity for each gene was calculated as the average intensity difference, represented by [Σ(PM – MM)/(number of probe pairs)], where PM denotes perfect match and MM denotes mismatch probes. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified by spectrophotometry. 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose MOPS gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with 32P-labeled DNA probes generated from random priming of cDNA for mouse gremlin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using Ready-to-go labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized with 2 × 106 cpm/ml hybridization buffer (Church and Gilbert hybridization buffer: 0.5 m NaHPO4, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar) with 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C overnight. Blots were washed in sequential washes of SSC, 0.1% SDS from 2× SSC to 0.1× SSC at 65 °C, exposed to film or to a PhosphorImager screen, and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Real time RT-PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (ABI, Foster City, CA) using Assays-On-Demand (ABI) PCR primer and probe sets for mouse gremlin (GenBank™ accession no. NM011824; ABI assay ID, Mm00488615) and eukaryotic 18 S rRNA as the endogenous control. RNA was treated with DNase I (DNA-Free, Ambion, Austin, TX) prior to RT-PCR reactions. RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan Universal RT-PCR Master Mix (ABI) in a 20-μl solution. The reaction conditions were 30 min hold at 48 °C, 10 min hold at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C (denaturation), and then 1 min and 60 s (annealing/extension). Each sample was analyzed in duplicate from three independent experiments. Two non-template control (RNase-free water) samples were included on each plate for each primer-probe set. The amount of gremlin was normalized to the endogenous reference (18 S rRNA). The mean sample threshold cycle (CT) and mean endogenous control CT were calculated for each sample from duplicate wells. The mean CT of the endogenous control was then subtracted from the CT of gremlin to give the ΔCT. The ΔCT of each sample was then subtracted from the control (time 0, untreated) ΔCT, which served as the reference sample. The relative amount of target gene expression was calculated using the formula 2–(ΔΔCT). The average and standard errors were calculated for the triplicate measurements, and the relative amount of target gene expression for each sample was plotted in Excel. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (8Elvin J.A. Yan C. Wang P. Nishimori K. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1018-1034Google Scholar, 31Albrecht U. Eichele G. Helms J.A. Lu H.C. Daston G.P. Molecular and Cellular Methods in Developmental Toxicology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 23-48Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly dissected ovaries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. Four-μmthick sections were cut and pretreated as described. A riboprobe was generated from a plasmid containing the full-length gremlin transcript. [α-35S]UTP-labeled antisense and sense probes were generated using the Riboprobe T7/T3/SP6 kits (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and hybridized to serial sections at 55 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 8.0), 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 0.5 mg/ml yeast RNA. All sense probes showed minimal to no background hybridization. High stringency washes were carried out in 2× SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.1× SSC at 65 °C. Dehydrated sections were dipped in NTB-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) and exposed at 4 °C for variable times. After they were developed, slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted for photography. PGE2 Assays—Granulosa cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well in 48-well tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.7 pg/ml selenium (ITS-A, Invitrogen), and 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and cultured overnight. The following morning, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated in medium containing 0.5% heat-inactivated FBS, 6.7 pg/ml selenium, penicillin/streptomycin, and the indicated ligands. Each treatment condition was carried out in duplicate or triplicate wells. Cell culture medium was collected after 12 h of treatment and stored at –20 °C until assayed. PGE2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the PGE2 enzyme-linked immunoassay Express Kit (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). The detection limit of this assay is 36 pg/ml. The results were verified in a minimum of three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer HSD test for multiple comparisons (version 5.1, JMP Software, Cary, NC). PGE2 data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for comparing treatment to control groups. p values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistics were performed on no less than three independent experiments. GDF9 Induces the Expression of Gremlin in Vitro—In vivo, GDF9 promotes the development of preovulatory follicles by changes in granulosa cell gene expression, including hyaluronan synthase 2, cyclooxygenase 2, pentraxin 3, urokinase plasminogen activator, and luteinizing hormone receptor (14Elvin J.A. Clark A.T. Wang P. Wolfman N.M. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1035-1048Google Scholar, 32Vassalli A. Matzuk M.M. Gardner H.A.R. Lee K.-F. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 414-427Google Scholar). To identify additional targets of GDF9 signaling, microarray analysis (Affymetrix, murine genome set U74Av2) was used to identify genes and expressed sequence tags differentially regulated by recombinant GDF9 in cultures of preovulatory granulosa cells. Granulosa cells were isolated from large antral follicles of immature mice and cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant mouse GDF9. A number of preovulatory genes previously identified as regulated by GDF9 (10Varani S. Elvin J.A. Yan C. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1154-1167Google Scholar, 14Elvin J.A. Clark A.T. Wang P. Wolfman N.M. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1035-1048Google Scholar) were confirmed by this assay (Table I). Pentraxin 3, an important regulator of cumulus cell-oocyte integrity and a down-stream gene of the GDF-9 signal transduction cascade (10Varani S. Elvin J.A. Yan C. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1154-1167Google Scholar), was up-regulated 5.3-fold. Also, hyaluronan synthase 2, the major hyaluronic acid synthase protein involved in cumulus expansion (14Elvin J.A. Clark A.T. Wang P. Wolfman N.M. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1035-1048Google Scholar, 33Fülop C. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 261-266Google Scholar), was up-regulated 8-fold.Table IGenes in granulosa cells up-regulated by GDF9GeneSymbol—Fold changeGenBank™ accession no.GremlinGrem18.6NM011824Hyaluronan synthase 2Has28.0U52524Pentraxin 3Ptx35.3X83601Insulin-like growth factor-1Igf12.0X04480 Open table in a new tab In this array experiment, gremlin showed the highest level of up-regulation by GDF9 and was increased by 8.6-fold. To confirm this result, independent samples of RNA from granulosa cells treated with GDF9 were analyzed by Northern blot analysis and quantitative real time PCR. By Northern blot analysis, a low but detectable amount of gremlin mRNA was present in control-treated cells (Fig. 1A). GDF9 induced the expression of gremlin within 5 h of treatment (Fig. 1A). Additionally, when cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GDF9, a dose-dependent induction of gremlin mRNA was observed (Fig. 1B). Doses as low as 12.5 ng/ml were able to stimulate the expression of gremlin (Fig. 1B). At the highest concentration tested (100 ng/ml), GDF9 was able to increase the expression of gremlin by ∼6–7-fold (Fig. 1B), consistent with the microarray results. To test the timing of gremlin induction by GDF9, granulosa cells were treated for 20 h with or without GDF9. Gremlin expression significantly increased after 3 h of treatment and continued to be significantly different from control-treated cells until 8 h post-induction (Fig. 2). At the end of these experiments, 20 h post-ligand stimulation, however, the level of gremlin in GDF9-treated samples was no longer different from the control-treated cells. Expression of Gremlin during Follicle Development in Mouse Ovaries—The expression of gremlin in the mouse ovary has not been described previously. To determine the cellular localization of gremlin during folliculogenesis, we performed in situ hybridization on ovaries from immature mice following superovulation with PMSG and hCG (Fig. 3). In unstimulated wild type mouse ovaries, gremlin is not expressed in type 3a (primary) follicles. However, gremlin localizes to granulosa cells of follicles of type 4 follicles (secondary) to later stages. Gremlin is not expressed in thecal cells and oocytes of any stage. 48 h after injection with PMSG, gremlin is up-regulated in mural as well as cumulus granulosa cells. Following an injection of hCG, a change in the expression pattern was apparent. By 5 h after hCG treatment, expression of gremlin was restricted to the layer of granulosa cells immediately adjacent to the antrum, as well as up-regulated in cumulus cells. Thus, the expression of gremlin in early follicles and cumulus granulosa cells was consistent with the known expression pattern of GDF9 in the adjacent oocytes during folliculogenesis. Gremlin Induction Is Limited to GDF9 and BMP—Additional members of the TGF-β superfamily were tested for the ability to stimulate gremlin expression in cultures of granulosa cells. BMP4, like GDF9, was able to increase the levels of gremlin in granulosa cells (Fig. 4); however, the level of gremlin in TGF-β1-treated granulosa cells was not different from control-treated cells (Fig. 4). Gremlin Blocks Downstream Effects of BMP4 but Not GDF9 Activity—Gremlin is a known inhibitor of the BMPs, but its effects on other members of the TGF-β superfamily protein are unknown. Gremlin expression by granulosa cells could potentially inhibit BMP4 signaling from the thecal cells, or the BMP15 and GDF9 signaling from the oocyte, or both. To determine the effect of gremlin on GDF9 and BMP4 signaling, GDF9 and BMP4 were preincubated with recombinant gremlin prior to the addition to granulosa cells, and the activity of these ligands was measured by their ability to increase PGE2 levels. PGE2 is up-regulated following GDF9 stimulation (Fig. 5) (15Elvin J.A. Yan C. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10288-10293Google Scholar) and is also induced in these cells by BMP4 (Fig. 5). When BMP4 was preincubated with recombinant gremlin prior to the addition to the culture medium, PGE2 induction by BMP4 was consistently inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. A 20-fold excess of gremlin (1 μg/ml) to BMP4 (50 ng/ml) was able to completely block BMP4-induced PGE2 accumulation. In contrast, no consistent decrease in GDF9 activity, as measured by PGE2 accumulation, was seen when cells were co-cultured with GDF9 (50 ng/ml) and gremlin, even at the levels that completely blocked BMP4 activity (1 μg/ml). These experiments provide evidence that GDF9 induces the expression of gremlin in granulosa cells, similar to BMP4. In cultured granulosa cells derived from large antral follicles, gremlin is expressed at low levels. After 5 h of treatment with either GDF9 or BMP4, gremlin was up-regulated by 5–7-fold over control levels. Gremlin is a member of the DAN family of BMP antagonists (34Hsu D.R. Economides A.N. Wang X. Eimon P.M. Harland R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 673-683Google Scholar), and this is the first report of the expression pattern in the mouse ovary and specifically within the granulosa cell compartment. Furthermore, we show in a functional assay measuring PGE2 accumulation that gremlin inhibits BMP4 but not GDF9 activity. This finding suggests that a conserved mechanism of BMP antagonism by negative regulatory factors during folliculogenesis is similar to other developmental processes, for example, during limb development (35Khokha M.K. Hsu D. Brunet L.J. Dionne M.S. Harland R.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 303-307Google Scholar, 36Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Google Scholar) and lung morphogenesis (37Shi W. Zhao J. Anderson K.D. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L1030-L1039Google Scholar). The inability of gremlin to inhibit GDF9 activity is a surprising finding. The extracellular BMP antagonists noggin, chordin, follistatin, and members of the DAN family have been shown to be up-regulated by the ligands that they inhibit (26Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Google Scholar). For example, in cultured osteoblasts, noggin is strongly induced by BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 (and weakly by TGF-β1), and in turn noggin inhibits the activity of the BMP ligands (38Gazzerro E. Gangji V. Canalis E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 2106-2114Google Scholar). Gremlin is up-regulated by BMP2 in cultured osteoblast cells and likewise attenuates BMP2 activity in vitro (39Pereira R.C. Economides A.N. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4558-4563Google Scholar). In granulosa cells, however, BMP4 and GDF9 appear to be equally capable of increasing gremlin expression, but only BMP4-induced PGE2 synthesis is affected. Thus, gremlin may serve an autoregulatory function when induced by BMPs but may also act as a paracrine factor, with expression that is mediated by different ligands and that has different neutralization properties for the various TGF-β superfamily ligands. This may be analogous to the broad effects known for follistatin, the activin antagonist. Follistatin is up-regulated by activin (40Michel U. McMaster J.W. Findlay J.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 147-156Google Scholar, 41Tano M. Minegishi T. Nakamura K. Nakamura M. Karino S. Miyamoto K. Ibuki Y. Mol. Cell.

McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar). Understanding which of the interactions is physiologically relevant will require specific knowledge about the spatial and temporal induction of the negative regulatory proteins and the different ligands that induce them during follicle development. With the exception of follistatin (47Jorgez C.J. Klysik M. Jamin S.P. Behringer R.R. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 18: 953-967Google Scholar), the in vivo significance of the extracellular BMP antagonists in reproductive tissues is unknown. The importance of BMP antagonism by these regulatory proteins has been well established by studies in other tissues (26Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Google Scholar). For example, gremlin antagonism of BMP is necessary to maintain a sonic hedgehog-fibroblast growth factor feedback loop necessary for proper limb patterning and outgrowth (35Khokha M.K. Hsu D. Brunet L.J. Dionne M.S. Harland R.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 303-307Google Scholar, 36Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Google Scholar). In gremlin null mice, limb development is disrupted, likely because of overactive BMP signaling (35Khokha M.K. Hsu D. Brunet L.J. Dionne M.S. Harland R.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 303-307Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these mice die 48 h after birth because of kidney agenesis (35Khokha M.K. Hsu D. Brunet L.J. Dionne M.S. Harland R.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 303-307Google Scholar) and thus cannot be used to examine postnatal follicle development. Fibroblast growth factors and BMPs are expressed in the rodent ovary (48Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 9Google Scholar, 49Valve E. Penttila T.L. Paranko J. Harkonen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 173-177Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be a functional conservation in their physiological interactions, which may include the induction of regulatory proteins to limit ligand bioactivity or to create activity gradients. Thus, more data are needed on the expression and function of gremlin and other BMP antagonists in the reproductive system. It is unclear how gremlin functions during ovarian follicle development, but the compartmentalization of gremlin expression changes dramatically as follicles mature. This suggests that the functional antagonism of BMP signaling may be necessary at multiple follicular stages. A model is presented in Fig. 6. In mice, GDF9 is not expressed in primordial follicles nor is it required for the transition from primordial to primary follicle (7Dong J. Albertini D.F. Nishimori K. Kumar T.R. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 531-535Google Scholar, 8Elvin J.A. Yan C. Wang P. Nishimori K. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1018-1034Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that gremlin is not expressed at these stages either. The BMPs, however, have been implicated in the transition from primordial to primary follicles (50Lee W.S. Otsuka F. Moore R.K. Shimasaki S. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 994-999Google Scholar, 51Nilsson E.E. Skinner M.K. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1265-1272Google Scholar), and the lack of gremlin expression may allow this to occur. During later folliculogenesis, GDF9 and BMP4/BMP7 presumably form inverse gradients because GDF9 is expressed from the oocyte, and BMP4 and BMP7 are expressed mostly from the thecal cell layer (see Fig. 6). Granulosa cells at this stage may be directed by GDF9 activity, and GDF9-induced gremlin may serve to restrict the BMP signal, perhaps to the outermost layers of granulosa or thecal cells or to the stroma. Five hours after an ovulatory dose of hCG, gremlin expression was shut off in the mural granulosa cells but maintained in the cumulus granulosa cells (i.e. those cells immediately adjacent to the oocyte). This has several implications. First, gremlin expression may be under the control, either directly or indirectly, of leutinizing hormone, the pituitary gonadotropin; following the preovulatory surges, GDF9 was able to direct or maintain expression of gremlin in the cumulus cells. Second, the lack of expression in mural granulosa cells and the maintenance of expression in cumulus cells may allow a BMP signal from the theca to act in the former but be blocked in the latter cells. High levels of BMP activity at this stage may be important for the onset of luteinization in mural granulosa cells. Presently, there are very few genes known to be direct targets of TGF-β superfamily signaling pathways in granulosa cells at different stages. A more complete inventory of genes differentially controlled by GDF9 and the BMPs will be necessary for understanding the mechanisms of BMP/GDF signaling in folliculogenesis.

The functional consequences of RNA editing of sodium channel transcripts, however, have yet to be determined. We characterized 20 splice variants of the German cockroach sodium channel gene BgNav. Functional analysis revealed that these variants exhibited a broad range of voltage-dependent activation and inactivation. Further analysis of two variants, BgNav1-1 and BgNav1-2, which activate at more depolarizing membrane potentials than other variants, showed that RNA editing events were responsible for variant-specific gating properties. Two U-to-C editing sites identified in BgNav1-1 resulted in a Leu to Pro change in segment 1 of domain III (IIIS1) and a Val to Ala change in IVS4. The Leu to Pro change shifted both the voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation in the depolarizing direction. Two A-to-I editing events in BgNav1-2 resulted in a Lys to Arg change in IS2 and an Ile to Met change in IVS3. The Lys to Arg change shifted the voltage dependence of activation in the depolarizing direction. Moreover, these RNA editing events occurred in a tissue-specific and development-specific manner. Our findings provide direct evidence that RNA editing is an important mechanism generating tissue-/cell type-specific functional variants of sodium channels.

Our findings provide direct evidence that RNA editing is an important mechanism generating tissue-/cell type-specific functional variants of sodium channels. The voltage-gated sodium channel is responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in the membranes of neurons and other excitable cells (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Google Scholar). At least nine different mammalian sodium channel α-subunits (Nav1.1 to Nav1.9) have been identified (2Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L. Caldwell J.H. Hofmann F. Howe J.R. Hunter J.C. Kellen R.G. Mandel G. Meisler M.H. Netter Y.B. Noda M. Tamkun M.M. Waxman S.G. Wood J.N. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 28: 365-368Google Scholar, 3Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Waxman S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 575-578Google Scholar). These sodium channel isoforms exhibit distinct expression patterns in the nervous system and skeletal and cardiac muscle (4Goldin A.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 871-894Google Scholar). Differences in electrophysiological properties have been observed among different mammalian sodium channel α-subunit isoforms, which likely contribute to their specialized functional roles in various tissues/cell types (4Goldin A.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 871-894Google Scholar, 5Dib-Hajj S.D. Black J.A. Cummins T.R. Waxman S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 253-259Google Scholar, 6Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207.1-207.7Google Scholar). In contrast to multiple sodium channel genes in mammals, there appears to be only one functional sodium channel gene in insects. For example, para is the only gene that encodes a functional sodium channel in Drosophila melanogaster (7Loughney K. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Cell. 1989; 58: 1143-1154Google Scholar, 8Feng G. Deak P.

Cohen C.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 119-133Google Scholar). Orthologs of the para gene, house fly Vssc1 and cockroach BgNav (formerly paraCSMA), have been cloned and characterized in Xenopus oocytes (10Smith T.J. Lee S.H. Ingles P.J. Knipple D.C. Soderlund D.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 807-812Google Scholar, 11Tan J. Liu Z. Tsai T.-D. Valles S.M. Goldin A.L. Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Alternative splicing and developmental regulation of alternative splicing have been documented in both mammalian and insect sodium channel genes (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar, 13Sarao R. Gupta S.K. Auld V.J. Dunn R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1873-1879Google Scholar, 14Schaller K.L. Krzemien D.M. McKenna N.M. Caldwell J.H.

Neurosci. 2002; 4: 125-133Google Scholar). Conservation of splicing sites among mammalian and insect sodium channel strongly suggests the biological importance of alternative splicing. Indeed, significant modifications of functional properties of sodium channels by alternative splicing have been demonstrated (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar, 19Dietrich P.S. McGivern J.G. Delgado S.G. Koch B.D. Eglen R.M. Hunter J.C. Sangameswaran L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2262-2272Google Scholar). RNA editing is another important post-transcriptional modification that could significantly change protein functions by introducing site-specific alterations in gene transcripts, including the conversion of one base to another, or the insertion and deletion of nucleotides (22Bass B.L. RNA Editing. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001Google Scholar, 23Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 261-263Google Scholar, 24Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 2002; 35: 17-20Google Scholar). Originally discovered in yeast tRNAs, A-to-I RNA editing has since been found in almost a dozen transcripts encoding ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors in the nervous system and also in multiple viral RNA transcripts (22Bass B.L. RNA Editing. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001Google Scholar). The best studied transcripts are subunits of mammalian glutamate-gated ion channels, a mammalian serotonin receptor (25Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchison L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Google Scholar, 26Niswender C.M. Copeland S.C. Herrick-Davis K. Emeson R.B. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9472-9478Google Scholar), and squid voltage-gated potassium channels (27Patton D.E. Silva T. Bezanilla F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 711-722Google Scholar, 28Rosenthal J.J.C. Bezanilla F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 743-757Google Scholar). In these cases, edited channels or receptors exhibit distinct functional and/or pharmacological properties. Ten A-to-I editing sites are found in the para transcript in D. melanogaster (29Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 437-449Google Scholar). However, the impact of RNA editing on sodium channel function remains elusive. Here, we showed that tissue-specific RNA editing in the cockroach sodium channel mRNA modulates sodium channel gating properties, providing the first direct evidence for the involvement of RNA editing in post-transcriptional modification of sodium channels. Cockroach Tissues—Ovary, gut, and leg and nerve cord tissues were isolated from insecticide-susceptible German cockroaches (CSMA). Nerve cords include thoracic ganglia, abdominal ganglia, and the connectives. For the analysis of developmental profile of BgNav transcripts, embryonic and immature stages were divided into the following five: embryonic stages I, II, and III, and nymph stages I and II. Embryos in embryonic stage I had uniform yolk and no obvious segmentation; stage II embryos had segmentation in abdomen and legs, but no eye coloration; and stage III embryos had very distinct eye color and well formed appendages and antennae. These three embryonic stages correspond to stages 1–5, stages 6–12, and stages 16–18, respectively, defined by Bell (30Bell W.L. The Laboratory Cockroach. Chapman and Hall, New York1981Google Scholar). The first and second nymphal instars were designated as nymph I and the last instar (6th) as nymph II. Molecular Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cockroach tissues, including head/thorax, leg, ovary, gut, and nerve cord, using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Methods for first-strand cDNA synthesis, reverse transcription-PCR, cloning, and PCR amplification of genomic DNA were identical to those described by Tan et al. (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar). Primers used for the PCR analysis of optional exons and RNA editing sites are listed in Table I. Total RNA from heads and thoraces of four cockroaches (about 90 mg of tissue) was used to isolate partial cDNA clones for identification of RNA editing sites. The nucleotide sequences were determined at the Genomic Technology Service Facility at Michigan State University.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for this studyPrimeraPrimers 1-14 were used to amplify alternative exons. Most of them correspond to sequences flanking these optional exons, except primers 6 and 12 designed based on alternative exon-specific sequences. Primer 15 was used in reverse transcription.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega, Madison, WI). BgNav1-1 has four amino acid changes: R502G, L1285P, V1685A, and I1806L (e.g. for R502G, Arg in the available sequence (GenBank accession number U73583) and Gly in BgNav1-1). BgNav1-2 also has four amino acid changes: R45G, K184R, I1663M, and N1787D. To determine which amino acid residue(s) contributed to the unique gating properties of BgNav1-1 and BgNav1-2, we replaced these residues individually with the corresponding residues in the published BgNav sequence. Briefly, a 0.9-kb KpnI/SphI fragment containing Gly502 in BgNav1-1, Gly45 and Arg184 in BgNav1-2, a 1.4-kb Eco47III fragment containing Pro1285 and Ala1685 in BgNav1-1 and Met1663 in BgNav1-2, and a 1.7-kb HindIII fragment containing Leu1806 in BgNav1-1 and Asp1787 in BgNav1-2 were used for site-directed mutagenesis. We also generated BgNav1-1A from BgNav1-1 by changing all four amino acid resides to the corresponding ones in the published BgNav sequence. Expression of BgNav Sodium Channels in Xenopus Oocytes—The procedures for oocyte preparation and cRNA injection are identical to those described by Tan et al. (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar). For robust expression of the cockroach BgNav sodium channel, BgNav cRNA (0.2–2 ng) was coinjected into oocytes with D. melanogaster tipE cRNA (0.2–2 ng), which is known to enhance the expression of insect sodium channels in oocytes (8Feng G. Deak P. Chopra M. Hall L.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 1001-1011Google Scholar, 9Warmke J.W. Reenan R.A.G. Wang P. Qian S. Arena J.P. Wang J. Wunderler D. Liu K. Kaczorowski G.J. Van Der Ploeg L.H.T. Ganetzky B. Cohen C.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 119-133Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Recording and Analysis—Methods for electrophysiological recording and data analysis are similar to those described previously (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of sodium channel conductance (G) was calculated by measuring the peak current at test potentials ranging from –80 mV to +65 mV in 5-mV increments and divided by (V – Vrev), where V is the test potential and Vrev is the reversal potential for sodium ion. Peak conductance values were normalized to the maximal peak conductance (Gmax) and fitted with a two-state Boltzmann equation of the form G/Gmax=(1+exp(V−V1/2)k)−1 (Eq. 1) in which V is the potential of the voltage pulse, V½ is the half-maximal voltage for activation, and k is the slope factor. The voltage dependence of sodium channel inactivation was determined using 200-ms inactivating pre-pulses from a holding potential of –120 mV to 0 mV in 5-mV increments, followed by test pulses to –10 mV for 20 ms. The peak current amplitude during the test depolarization was normalized to the maximum current amplitude and plotted as a function of the pre-pulse potential. The data were fitted with a two-state Boltzmann equation of the form I/Imax=(1+(exp(V−V1/2)/k))−1 (Eq. 2) in which Imax is the maximal current evoked, V is the potential of the voltage pulse, V½ is the half-maximal voltage for inactivation, and k is the slope factor. To determine the recovery from fast inactivation, sodium channels were inactivated by a 200-ms depolarizing pulse to –10 mV and then repolarized to –120 mV for an interval of variable durations followed by a 20-ms test pulse to –10 mV. The peak current during the test pulse was divided by the peak current during the inactivating pulse and plotted as a function of duration time between the two pulses. To determine the time constant for recovery, the curve was fitted using double exponential function I=1−(A1*exp(−t/τ1)+A2*exp(−t/τ2)) (Eq. 3) where A1 and A2 are the relative proportions of current recovering with time constants τ1 and τ2, and t is recovery interval. Identification of 20 Splice Types of the Cockroach Sodium Channel Gene—In a previous study, we reported the isolation and functional characterization of three cockroach BgNav variants, KD1, KD2, and KD3 (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar). These variants exhibit distinct gating and pharmacological properties (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar). To elucidate the full complement of the BgNav sodium channel diversity, we isolated 66 more full-length cDNA clones using the same cloning strategy in this study. Extensive restriction enzyme digestion of these clones revealed sequence polymorphism in several regions. Subsequent PCR sequencing analysis of these regions using PCR primers in Table I confirmed deletions or insertions of short segments, ranging from 19 to 129 bp in size. Because the locations and sequences of most insertions or deletions are homologous to the optional exons identified in the Drosophila para transcripts (16Thackeray J.R. Ganetzky B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2569-2578Google Scholar, 17Thackeray J.R. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1995; 141: 203-214Google Scholar, 18O'Dowd D.K. Gee J.R. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4005-4012Google Scholar), these cockroach alternative exons are designated with the same letters, except in capitals (Fig. 1A). Most optional exons are located in the first or second intracellular linkers connecting domains I and II or domains II and III. High degrees of sequence homology are evident between Drosophila optional exons a and b and the corresponding cockroach exons A and B. Because exon A contains 19 nucleotides, exclusion of exon A results in frameshift, introducing a premature stop codon downstream in the first linker connecting domains I and II. Optional exon K is found only in cockroach and encodes 43 amino acid residues in IS2-3. 1Domains are designated with Roman numerals and segments within the domains with Arabic numbers; for example IS2-3 is domain I, segment 2-3. Examination of the presence or absence of each alternative exon in the 69 full-length clones, including KD1, KD2, and KD3, revealed 20 splice types (Fig. 1B), which are far less than the possible random combinations of the identified alternative exons. This observation strongly suggests biased inclusion and exclusion of certain exons in sodium channels. In fact, 38 clones, including KD1, had the same splice type (Fig. 1B), which represents the most prevalent sodium channel splice type in the German cockroach. Hereinafter, we refer to the variants according to their splice types. For example, variants that belong to splice type 1 are named BgNav1-1, BgNav1-2, and so on. Therefore, KD1, KD2, and KD3 are renamed BgNav1-1, BgNav2, and BgNav3, respectively. Sodium Channel Variants Exhibit Different Gating Properties—Variants BgNav1-1, BgNav2, and BgNav3 were characterized previously in oocytes, revealing distinct gating and pharmacological properties (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar). In this study, we performed functional analysis of eighteen new variants including two type 1 variants (BgNav1-2 and BgNav1-3) and 16 variants each representing a unique splice type (BgNav5 to BgNav20). The electrophysiological properties of these variants were examined using two-electrode voltage clamp. 9 of 18 variants produced sufficient sodium currents for functional analysis (Table II), whereas the remaining 9 variants produced little or no sodium currents, possibly representing nonfunctional channels or channels that require additional cellular signals for robust expression. Sodium currents were completely blocked by tetrodotoxin at 10 nm for all functional splice variants except for BgNav11. BgNav11 exhibited a low level of resistance to TTX. At 10 nm, 60% of BgNav11 peak current was inhibited, and a concentration of 50 nm was required to block it completely.Table IIFunctional properties of nine splice variantsActivationFast inactivationRecovery from inactivationV1/2kV1/2kτ1A1τ2A2mVmVms%ms%BgNav1-2-24.9 ± 1.44.9 ± 0.4-49.0 ± 0.74.8 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.186 ± 249 ± 914 ± 2BgNav5-25.5 ± 0.94.8 ± 0.4-45.5 ± 0.94.3 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.190 ± 228 ± 710 ± 2BgNav6-27.4 ± 6.24.0 ± 1.0-38.7 ± 1.84.2 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.193 ± 338 ± 47 ± 3BgNav7-29.2 ± 3.84.1 ± 0.5-44.9 ± 1.84.4 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.190 ± 418 ± 510 ± 4BgNav8-30.1 ± 4.45.4 ± 0.5-54.4 ± 1.45.6 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.089 ± 135 ± 611 ± 1BgNav9-30.6 ± 3.94.2 ± 0.7-49.3 ± 0.64.1 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.290 ± 224 ± 810 ± 2BgNav1-3-34.1 ± 4.44.3 ± 0.4-48.4 ± 0.84.6 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.189 ± 326 ± 311 ± 3BgNav10-36.7 ± 3.41.9 ± 0.6-37.2 ± 0.93.7 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.095 ± 124 ± 55 ± 1BgNav11-43.9 ± 3.04.7 ± 0.8-54.0 ± 1.54.5 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.194 ± 170 ± 126 ± 1 Open table in a new tab All 9 functional variants activated rapidly in response to depolarization and then inactivated rapidly and nearly completely, similar to that reported for BgNav1-1 (12Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Google Scholar). To determine whether different variants exhibit different gating properties, the voltage dependence of activation, voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation, and recovery from fast inactivation were determined using the protocols described under “Experimental Procedures.” The voltage for half-maximal activation ranged from –25 to –44 mV (Table II). BgNav11 activated at a more hyperpolarizing membrane potential, and BgNav1-1 and BgNav1-2 required larger membrane depolarization for activation. The remaining variants exhibited properties intermediate between these two extremes. A broad voltage range for half-maximal inactivation, from –37 to –54 mV, was evident among the variants (Table II). BgNav8 and BgNav11 inactivated at more negative membrane potentials than the others. There was no significant difference in kinetics of recovery from inactivation among the variants (Table II). Optional Exon B Modulates Sodium Current Expression—9 of the 18 variants could not be functionally analyzed because they did not conduct sufficient sodium currents. 5 variants did not generate any sodium current in oocytes. Among them, BgNav20 contained a premature stop codon caused by the exclusion of optional exon A. BgNav12, BgNav13, and BgNav14 lacked exon K (encoding IS2-3). BgNav19 contained two mutually exclusive exons, G1 and G2. It is likely that introduction of a premature stop codon in BgNav20, missing part of transmembrane segment IS2-3 (exon K) in BgNav12, BgNav13, and BgNav14, or having an extra transmembrane segment (exons G1 and G2) in IIIS3-4 in BgNav19 are responsible for nonfunctional channels in oocytes. The remaining four variants, BgNav15, BgNav16, BgNav17, and BgNav18, however, did not have any stop codon or missing transmembrane segments, but the peak current amplitude for these variants was less than 0.5 μA 1 week after injection of 2 ng of cRNA/oocyte, which was not sufficient for functional analysis. Comparison of alternative exon usage revealed that all four variants contained exon B, which encodes an 8-amino acid sequence in the first linker connecting domains I and II (Fig. 1A). To determine whether inclusion of exon B is responsible for poor expression of sodium current in these variants, we deleted exon B from variants BgNav15 and BgNav16. The resultant recombinant construct produced robust expression of sodium currents (Fig. 2). Furthermore, when we inserted exon B into functional BgNav1-1A, which is identical in sequence to published BgNav (accession number U73583), the amplitude of peak current of the recombinant channels was greatly reduced (Fig. 2). These complementary results demonstrated that exon B modulates sodium channel expression and/or function. However, one exon B-containing variant, BgNav10, produced sufficient sodium currents (greater than 0.5 μA in amplitude) for functional analysis. We hypothesize that an unidentified sequence(s) in BgNav10 counteracted the negative regulation of sodium current expression by exon B. L1285P in BgNav1-1 Alters the Voltage Dependence of Activation and Steady-state Inactivation—In addition to different alternative exon usage, sequence analysis of the 9 functional variants revealed on average five scattered amino acid changes compared with the published BgNav sequence (31Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 93-100Google Scholar; GenBank accession number U73583) (Table III). We next examined a possible contribution of these amino acid differences to the observed differences in gating properties among variants.Table IIIScattered amino acid changes in BgNav variantsBgNav1-1R502GL1285PV1685AI1806LBgNav1-2R45GK184RI1663MN1798DBgNav1-3L453VF396LV1223AM1637VI1663MI1899TBgNav5R45GV106MK425RQ694RS1143GI1663MBgNav6M955VS1143GI1488MI1663MV1693ABgNav7F143LF821SN1019DF1028SI1663MT1915ABgNav8R45GF157SH554YI630RA823TG1162RE1649GR1686GBgNav9V75AA414TN795DF820SA1288PL1348HK1674RD2030NBgNav10R564GD688GS1032PN1485SI1663MS1633ABgNav11H635LF1627LP1679SG1842S Open table in a new tab Both BgNav1-1 and BgNav1-2 activate at about 10 mV more depolarizing potentials than other variants. BgNav1-1 possesses four amino acid changes compared with the published sequence (Table III). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we individually changed these four residues in BgNav1-1 to the corresponding residues in the published BgNav sequence, producing four recombinant channels, G502R, P1285L, A1685V, and L1806I (e.g. for G502R: changing Gly in BgNav1-1 to Arg in the published sequence). Compared with the parental channel BgNav1-1, P1285L reverted the voltage dependence of activation by about 10 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction (Fig. 3 and Table IV). It also caused a 5-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (Fig. 3 and Table IV). The other three substitutions caused a subtle (3–4-mV) hyperpolarizing shift in activation but no effect on inactivation (Fig. 3 and Table IV). Therefore, Pro1285 in BgNav1-1 appears to be responsible for the large depolarization-required activation of the BgNav1-1 channel.Table IVGating properties of BgNav1-1 and its mutantsActivationInactivationV1/2kV1/2kmVmVBgNav1-1-23.7 ± 1.85.4 ± 0.7-43.7 ± 1.25.2 ± 0.2G502R-27.4* ± 1.15.3 ± 0.3-43.7 ± 0.74.8 ± 0.4P1285L-32.6** ± 1.34.1 ± 1.0-48.9** ± 1.44.7 ± 0.2A1685V-26.4* ± 1.84.7 ± 0.9-42.4 ± 1.15.3 ± 0.3L1806I-26.6* ± 1.95.5 ± 0.6-44.5 ± 0.95.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab L1285P and V1685A Are the Result of Tissue-specific U-to-C Editing—The L1285P change in BgNav1-1 resulted from a nucleotide change from T3854 to C3854. To examine whether this change is the result of RNA editing, we amplified an ∼300-bp cDNA, which contains the L1285P change, using primers 16 and 17 and cDNA from heads/thorax, ovary, or gut (Fig. 4). Because the Leu (CTC) to Pro (CCC) change created a recognition site, CCCGC(N)4, for restriction enzyme FauI, we were able to determine the presence of T or C in the isolated clones by restriction enzyme digestion. All 46 clones isolated from head/thorax hadaTat nucleotide 3854. However, we identified two types of clones from ovary and gut. Although most of the clones contain a T, 6 of 28 clones from ovary and 3 of 20 clones from gut contained a C at nucleotide 3854. An ∼2.8-kb PCR fragment was amplified using the same PCR primer pair (primers 16 and 17) and genomic DNA as the template. Sequencing of the 2.8-kb fragment revealed a T at the corresponding position. Therefore, the Leu to Pro change in IIIS1 resulted from a U-to-C editing event, and this editing occurs only in ovary and gut. By convention, this editing site is designated as Leu/Pro site. Previous studies showed that when both edited and unedited transcripts were produced, direct sequencing of the reverse transcription-PCR products could sometimes result in mixed sequence signals in the chromatogram (29Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P. O'Connell M.A. Reenan R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 437-449Google Scholar). We used direct sequencing of the reverse transcription-PCR product and found a double peak signal at the Leu/Pro site in ovary and gut but a single peak in nerve cord and leg of the same cockroach individuals (Fig. 5, A–D), further confirming that the Leu/Pro editing event is tissue-specific.Fig. 5Tissue-specific and development-specific editing of the Ile/Met site. Sequence analysis reveals single or double peak signals at the Ile/Met site in four tissues: nerve cord (A), leg (B), ovary (C), and gut (D), and five developmental stages: embryonic I (F), II (G) and III (H); nymphal I (I) and II (J).

To clarify the molecular basis of the high potency of the α-toxin LqhαIT (from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus) for insect NaChs, we identified by mutagenesis the key residues important for activity. We have found that the functional surface is composed of two distinct domains: a conserved “Core-domain” formed by residues of the loops connecting the secondary structure elements of the molecule core and a variable “NC-domain” formed by a five-residue turn (residues 8–12) and a C-terminal segment (residues 56–64). We further analyzed the role of these domains in toxin activity on insects by their stepwise construction onto the scaffold of the anti-mammalian α-toxin, Aah2 (from Androctonus australis hector). The chimera harboring both domains, Aah2LqhαIT(face), was as active to insects as LqhαIT. Structure determination of Aah2LqhαIT(face) by x-ray crystallography revealed that the NC-domain deviates from that of Aah2 and forms an extended protrusion off the molecule core as appears in LqhαIT. Notably, such a protrusion is observed in all α-toxins active on insects. Altogether, the division of the functional surface into two domains and the unique configuration of the NC-domain illuminate the molecular basis of α-toxin specificity for insects and suggest a putative binding mechanism to insect NaChs.

Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaChs) 1The abbreviations used are: NaCh, sodium channel; CD, circular dichroism; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. mediate the transient increase in sodium ion permeability that triggers action potentials in excitable cells (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Google Scholar). These channels are composed of a pore-forming α-subunit (260 kDa) associated with one or two auxiliary β-subunits. The α-subunit consists of four repeat domains (D1–D4), each containing six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and a membrane-associated re-entrant segment (SS1–SS2), connected by internal and external loops. A key feature in the function of NaChs is their gating behavior, namely the ability to rapidly activate and inactivate upon cell membrane depolarization, leading to transient increase in Na+ conductance (1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Google Scholar). Due to their key role in excitability, these channels are targeted by a variety of toxins. Long-chain scorpion toxins are 61- to 76-residue-long polypeptides that share a similar core composed of an α-helix packed against a three-stranded β-sheet and stabilized by four disulfide bonds. These toxins bind to various receptor sites on the extracellular face of NaChs and alter their gating. Traditionally, they are divided into two major classes, α- and β-toxins, according to their mode of action and binding properties to distinct receptor sites on NaChs (2Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Couraud F. Chang L.W. Dyer R.S. Handbook of Neurotoxicology. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 683-716Google Scholar, 3Gordon D. Savarin P. Gurevitz M. Zinn-Justin S. J. Toxicol.-Toxin Rev. 1998; 17: 131-159Google Scholar). Scorpion α-toxins prolong the action potential by slowing channel inactivation, possibly through interference with the outward movement of the D4S4 segment necessary for the fast inactivation process (4Cestele S. Catterall W.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 883-892Google Scholar). The scorpion α-toxin binding site, termed neurotoxin receptor site-3, has been shown to involve the extracellular regions of D1 and D4 and in particular the S3–S4 loop in D4 (5Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Google Scholar, 6Rogers J.C. Qu Y. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Google Scholar). Several structurally unrelated peptide toxins from sea anemones and spiders are able to compete with scorpion α-toxins on binding to receptor site-3 of vertebrate and invertebrate NaChs, suggesting similarity of this receptor in phylogenetically distant organisms (5Catterall W.A.

However, dramatic differences in the potency of various scorpion α-toxins toward insects and mammals were observed in vivo by toxin administration, and in vitro by competition binding assays to insect and rat-brain neuronal preparations. Based on their preferential activity in mammals and insects, scorpion α-toxins were divided into three pharmacological subgroups (see Fig. 1): 1) classic anti-mammalian toxins, such as Aah2 (from Androctonus australis hector) and Lqh2 (from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus), which bind with high affinity to rat brain NaChs (0.2–0.3 nm) and are practically non-toxic to insects; 2) α-toxins highly active on insects (e.g. LqhαIT), which bind to insect NaChs with high affinity (∼0.07 nm) and are over three orders of magnitude less potent in mammalian brain compared with Aah2; and 3) α-like toxins that are toxic in both mammalian brain and insects (2Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Couraud F. Chang L.W. Dyer R.S. Handbook of Neurotoxicology. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 683-716Google Scholar, 9Gordon D. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Cestele S. Kopeyan C. Carlier E. Ben Khalifa R.

Heinemann S.H. Menez A. Perspectives in Molecular Tocxinology. Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK2002: 215-238Google Scholar). Despite these differences, α-toxins of the three pharmacological subgroups are similarly toxic to mice by subcutaneous injection and were shown to affect with similar affinity rat skeletal muscle NaChs (14Chen H. Gordon D. Heinemann S. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 439: 423-432Google Scholar). Therefore, the variations in effects of scorpion α-toxins on different NaChs imply heterogeneity in toxin functional surfaces as well as in their receptor sites (9Gordon D. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Cestele S. Kopeyan C. Carlier E. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8034-8045Google Scholar, 15Gilles N. Chen H. Wilson H. Legall F. Montoya G. Molgo J. Schönherr R.

Neurosci. 2002; 16: 767-770Google Scholar). Elucidation of the inherent ability of various scorpion α-toxins to differentiate between insect and mammalian NaChs, or among NaCh subtypes in mammalian excitable tissues, is of potential value for future design of selective drugs and insecticides. However, although partial information on the putative functional surfaces of LqhαIT (17Zilberberg N. Froy O. Cestele S. Loret E. Arad D. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14810-14816Google Scholar, 18Gurevitz M. Gordon D. Ben-Natan S. Turkov M. Froy O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1201-1205Google Scholar) and the α-like toxin BmK-M1 (19Wang C.G. Gilles N. Hamon A. Le Gall F. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Xiong Y.M. Wang D.C. Chi C.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4699-4708Google Scholar) has been reported, the molecular basis of their ability to distinguish among NaCh subtypes is still unclear. To address this question, we used LqhαIT and Aah2, which differ markedly in potency to insect and rat brain NaChs. Molecular dissection of LqhαIT revealed that residues important for function are clustered in two distinct domains. Construction of these residues onto the anti-mammalian α-toxin, Aah2 (Fig. 1B), yielded a functional chimera with anti-insect activity. Determination of the x-ray structure of this chimera highlighted structural features underlying the preference of scorpion α-toxins for insect NaChs. Bacterial and Animal Strains—Escherichia coli DH5α cells were used for plasmid constructions. E. coli BL21 cells were used for the expression of the recombinant toxins using the pET-11c vector (20Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D. Lin S. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene. 1987; 56: 125-135Google Scholar) as was described (21Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Zlotkin E. Pelhate M. Norris T. Adams M.E. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10215-10222Google Scholar). Sarcophaga falculata blowfly larvae were bred in the laboratory. Cloning the Gene Encoding Lqh2—Two degenerate oligonucleotide primers, spanning the first eight and last six amino acid residues of Lqh2 (Fig. 1A; primer 1: 5′-AT(A/C/T)AA(A/G)GA(T/C)GG(G/A/T/C)TA(T/C)AT(A/T/C)GT(G/A/T/C)GA-3′; primer 2: 5′-(C/T)C(T/G)(A/G)CA(C/T)C(T/G)(G/A/T/C)CC(G/A/T/C)GG(G/A/T/C)CC-3′), were used for PCR with the cDNA library of the scorpion L. quinquestriatus hebraeus (22Gurevitz M. Urbach D. Zlotkin E. Zilberberg N. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 1270-1272Google Scholar) as template. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PCR product was identical to that of the mature Lqh2 polypeptide (23Sautiere P. Cestele S. Kopeyan C. Martinage A. Drobeco H. Doljansky Y. Gordon D. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1141-1154Google Scholar). The gene encoding Lqh2 was engineered with NdeI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and the 3′-termini, respectively, and cloned into the expression vector pET-11cK (21Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Zlotkin E. Pelhate M. Norris T. Adams M.E. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10215-10222Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no recombinant Lqh2 accumulated within inclusion bodies, although its engineered derivatives were expressed successfully. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Functional Expression, and Purification of Toxins—Mutations in the cDNAs encoding LqhαIT and Lqh2 were generated by PCR with pBluescript bearing the appropriate cDNA clone as template (22Gurevitz M. Urbach D. Zlotkin E. Zilberberg N. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 1270-1272Google Scholar). Sequences of the mutated cDNAs were verified prior to expression by automatic sequencing. Production of recombinant polypeptides in a non-soluble form, renaturation, and high-performance liquid chromatography purification of the active toxins were performed as was previously described (17Zilberberg N. Froy O. Cestele S. Loret E. Arad D. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14810-14816Google Scholar, 21Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Zlotkin E. Pelhate M. Norris T. Adams M.E. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10215-10222Google Scholar). All toxin mutants were eluted from the C18 high-performance liquid chromatography column as major peaks at 24–26% acetonitrile, similarly to the wild type toxin (17Zilberberg N. Froy O. Cestele S. Loret E. Arad D. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14810-14816Google Scholar). Quantification of purified recombinant toxin variants was performed by amino acid analysis using an ABI system 420A/130A (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) after hydrolysis by 6 m HCl under vacuum (18 h at 110 °C). CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a model 202 circular dichroism spectrometer (Aviv Instruments, Lakewood, NJ). Toxins (140 μm) were dissolved in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and their spectrum was measured using a quartz cell of 0.1-mm light path. Blank spectrum of the buffer was run under identical conditions and subtracted from each of the toxin spectra. Toxicity Assays—Four-day-old blowfly larvae (S. falculata; 150 ± 20 mg of body weight) were injected inter-segmentally. A positive result was scored when a characteristic paralysis (immobilization and contraction) was observed up to 5 min after injection. Five concentrations of each toxin were injected to larvae (nine larvae in each group) in three independent experiments. Effective dose 50% (ED50) values were calculated according to the sampling and estimation method of Reed and Muench (24Reed L. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Competition Binding Experiments—Radioiodinated LqhαIT was prepared as was previously described (9Gordon D. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Cestele S. Kopeyan C. Carlier E. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8034-8045Google Scholar, 25Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H. Heinemann S.H. Gordon D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14576-14584Google Scholar). Insect neuronal membranes were prepared from heads of adult cockroaches (Periplaneta americana (26Gilles N. Krimm I. Bouet F. Froy O. Gurevitz M. Lancelin J.M. Gordon D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1735-1745Google Scholar)). Equilibrium competition assays were performed using increasing concentrations of the unlabeled toxin in the presence of a constant low concentration of the labeled toxin (30–50 pm) (9Gordon D. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Cestele S. Kopeyan C. Carlier E. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8034-8045Google Scholar). The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for inhibition of toxin binding were determined by a non-linear regression analysis using the Hill equation, employing a Hill coefficient of 1. Mathematical curve fitting for IC50 determination was accomplished using Kaleidagraph (version 3.08, Synergy Software). Ki values were calculated by the equation Ki = IC50/1 + [L*/Kd], in which L* is the concentration of the radioactive ligand and Kd is its dissociation constant (27Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals of Aah2LqhαIT(face) were grown using the vapor-diffusion (hanging-drop) technique. A 2-μl reservoir solution containing 100 mm trisodium citrate dihydrate (pH 5.6), 1 m monoammonium dihydrogen phosphate (Hampton Research Crystal Screen 1, condition No. 11) was mixed with an equal amount of the protein dissolved in water (10 mg/ml). Tetragonal crystals of ∼0.15 mm × 0.15 mm × 0.03 mm were grown overnight at room temperature. The crystals were packed into thin-wall glass capillaries and analyzed using the synchrotron at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data Collection and Processing—Single crystal x-ray data were collected at 100 K using an ADSC Q4 charge-couple device detector at ID14-EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Prior to the data collection, the crystals were harvested for a short time (fraction of a minute) in a solution mimicking the reservoir solution supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol. The oscillation range per image was 0.25° with exposure of 0.5 s/image. In addition to the initial data set, two additional data sets were collected with direct beam intensity reduced by a factor of 12 and 36 to occlude overexposed reflections. Data were integrated with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar).

Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Google Scholar). The search model was based on the structure of Aah2 from the scorpion A. australis hector (30Smith G.D. Blessing R.H.

The rotation and translation searches were tried in various resolutions and a recognizable solution was obtained in the resolution range of 30–2.5 Å (r = 0.51, CC = 0.370). The space group ambiguity was resolved on the level of a translation search favoring space group I422. Model Building and Refinement—The structure of Aah2LqhαIT(face) was rebuilt from the model using the program O (30Smith G.D. Blessing R.H. Ealick S.E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Hauptman H.A. Housset D.

An anisotropic overall B factor correction and bulk-solvent correction were applied. No low resolution or sigma cutoff was used to truncate data.

Refinement statistics for the final model are shown in Table I. The final model of Aah2LqhαIT(face) included 518 protein atoms and 132 water molecules. In addition, sulfate and nitrate ions with obvious electron density and reasonable stereochemistry were included. The final model was validated using PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and fell within the limits of all quality criteria. For Aah2LqhαIT(face) Ramachandran plot (36Ramachandran G.M. Sasuskeharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Google Scholar), 94.3% of the dihedral angles of the peptide backbone were in acceptable regions of the Phi-Psi diagram. The PDB accession number for Aah2LqhαIT(face) is 1SEG. The figures were prepared using PyMOL (available at www.pymol.org). The scorpion toxin pair, LqhαIT and Aah2, represents two extremes in potency for insect versus mammalian brain NaChs (3Gordon D. Savarin P. Gurevitz M. Zinn-Justin S. J. Toxicol.-Toxin Rev. 1998; 17: 131-159Google Scholar), and their three-dimensional structures are available (37Tugarinov V. Kustanovitz I. Zilberberg N. Gurevitz M. Anglister Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2414-2424Google Scholar, 38Housset D. Habersetzer-Rochat C. Astier J.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 88-103Google Scholar). We have utilized the cDNA clones of LqhαIT and Lqh2 to analyze the molecular basis of α-toxin specificity for insect NaChs. Because Lqh2 differs from Aah2 only in the first and last residues (Fig. 1A), we constructed an Aah2 clone by mutagenesis of both termini. Mutagenic Analysis of LqhαIT—We further analyzed by mutagenesis the external surface that has previously been implicated in LqhαIT function (17Zilberberg N. Froy O. Cestele S. Loret E. Arad D. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14810-14816Google Scholar, 18Gurevitz M. Gordon D. Ben-Natan S. Turkov M. Froy O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1201-1205Google Scholar). Each mutant was produced in a recombinant form, and its binding properties were examined on cockroach neuronal membranes. These assays were accompanied by CD spectroscopy to discern between effects resulting from structural perturbation and those reflecting putative interaction with the channel receptor. In general, the CD spectra of most mutants were indistinguishable from those of the unmodified toxin. Residues, whose substitution decreased substantially the binding affinity (Ki mutant/Ki wild-type > 20) with no alteration of the CD spectrum were considered significant for activity and assigned to the putative functional surface. Out of 21 residues analyzed, substitution of 10 (Tyr-14, Glu-15, Asp-19, Tyr-21, Glu-24, Leu-25, Lys-28, Ala-39, Asn-54, and Pro-56) had little effect on activity (Table II).Table IIEffect of substitutions on the binding of LqhaIT to cockroach NaChs The change in binding affinity of each mutant is presented as the ratio of Ki values of the mutant over the unmodified toxin (66 ± 4 pm, n = 5). Mutations reported previously (17Zilberberg N. Froy O. Cestele S. Loret E. Arad D. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14810-14816Google Scholar, 18Gurevitz M. Gordon D. Ben-Natan S.

Substitution of Trp-38 and Asn-44 by Ala resulted in altered CD spectra accompanied by a marked decrease in activity (Table II and Fig. 2). However, the activity of mutants F17W and W38Y was similar to that of the unmodified toxin (Table II), suggesting that aromatic side chains at these positions are important for activity. Residues Phe-17, Arg-18, Trp-38, and Asn-44 form a packed cluster on the surface of LqhαIT held together by a network of intra-molecular interactions (e.g. aromatic and hydrophobic interactions between Phe-17, Trp-38, and Asn-44, as well as hydrophobic interactions between the phenyl ring of Phe-17 and the hydrophobic moiety of Arg-18 (37Tugarinov V. Kustanovitz I. Zilberberg N. Gurevitz M. Anglister Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2414-2424Google Scholar)). Therefore, substitution of any of these residues may affect the structural organization of this cluster, and thereby the activity. Mutagenesis of most residues at the C-tail region (I57A/T, R58K, V59A/G, R58K/V59A, K62A/L/R, and R64N) reduced the activity (Table II), but the most detrimental effect was obtained upon substitution of Arg-58. Neutralization of the charge of Arg-58 (R58N) destroyed toxin function (Table II) and was accompanied by a substantial change in the CD spectrum, indicating structural perturbation (Fig. 2). In contrast, R58K (conserved substitution), with a CD spectrum similar to that of the unmodified toxin (Fig. 2), reduced the activity 77-fold (Table II). This result suggests that the charged amine groups and the aliphatic moiety at position 58 are both important for toxin function. Thus, residues whose substitution affected the function appear on the molecule exterior in two domains (Fig. 3). One domain consists of Phe-17, Arg-18, Trp-38, and Asn-44, of the loops connecting the secondary structure motifs of the molecule α/β-core (“Core-domain”), whereas the second domain (“NC-domain”) is constituted by the five-residue-turn (residues 8–12) and the C-terminal region (residues 56–64; refs. 18Gurevitz M. Gordon D. Ben-Natan S. Turkov M. Froy O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1201-1205Google Scholar, 37Tugarinov V. Kustanovitz I. Zilberberg N. Gurevitz M. Anglister Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2414-2424Google Scholar). To clarify the role of these domains in the unique preference of LqhαIT for insect NaChs, we constructed the Core-domain and/or the NC-domain of LqhαIT onto the scaffold of the antimammalian scorpion α-toxin, Aah2, and analyzed the activity of the resulting chimeras. Construction of the Functional Face of LqhαIT onto Aah2—The primary structures of Aah2 and LqhαIT (Fig. 1A) are 70% similar, and Arg-18, Trp-38, and Asn-44 of the Core-domain are conserved. However, both toxins vary considerably in the NC-domain (residues 8–10 and 56–64), in which 9 out of 11 residues (excluding Cys-63) differ. Based on this observation, we used the clone encoding Aah2 (produced from the cDNA encoding Lqh2) to construct the following chimeras: Aah2LqhαIT(8–10) and Aah2LqhαIT(56–64), in which segments 8–10 or 56–64 of Aah2 were substituted by their LqhαIT counterparts, and Aah2LqhαIT(8–10, 56–64), in which both substitutions were combined. Aah2LqhαIT(8–10) and Aah2LqhαIT(56–64) were not toxic to blowfly larvae at concentrations up to 10 μg/100 mg of body weight (the LqhαIT dose paralytic to 50% of blowfly larvae, ED50 = 13 ng/100 mg), and their binding affinity was more than 1000-fold lower than that of LqhαIT. The lack of activity did not result necessarily from structural perturbation or misfolding, because Aah2LqhαIT(8–10) exhibited high affinity for cloned Nav1.2a channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (data not shown). Aah2LqhαIT(8–10, 56–64), however, was 380-fold more toxic to blowfly larvae compared with Aah2 (ED50 of the chimera is 64 ng/-100 mg body weight, whereas that of Aah2 is > 10 μg/100 mg), and only 5-fold weaker than LqhαIT. An additional 2-fold increase in toxicity to insects was obtained upon a G17F mutation in Aah2LqhαIT(8–10, 56–64). The resulting chimera, Aah2LqhαIT(8–10, 17, 56–64), was almost as active on blowfly larvae as LqhαIT (ED50 = 37 ng/100 mg body weight), its binding affinity (Ki = 0.26 ± 0.04 nm) for cockroach neuronal membranes was only 3.9-fold lower than that of LqhαIT, and it lost the high affinity for rat brain synaptosomes characterizing Aah2 (Ki > 1000 nm versus 0.2 nm of Aah2). In addition, the toxicity of this chimera to mice injected subcutaneously was similar to that of LqhαIT. Therefore, this chimera was termed Aah2LqhαIT(face). To elucidate the fine structural details conferring preference for insect NaChs, we crystallized Aah2LqhαIT(face) and determined its structure by x-ray diffraction. Three-dimensional Structure of Aah2LqhαIT(face)—The three-dimensional structure of Aah2LqhαIT(face) was determined by x-ray diffraction at 1.3-Å resolution. The core of Aah2LqhαIT(face) is made of an α-helix (residues 19–28) packed against a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (residues 2–4, 32–37, and 45–51) and is very similar to that of Aah2 (Fig. 4A) (38Housset D. Habersetzer-Rochat C. Astier J.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 88-103Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) calculated for the chimeric peptide backbone atoms encompassing residues 13–55 was 0.15 Å. In contrast, substantial deviations from the Aah2 structure were observed for the backbone atoms of residues 8–10 and 56–64 grafted from LqhαIT (r.m.s.d. = 1.2 Å and 1.5 Å, respectively).

Secretion-like coupling between elements in the plasma membrane (PM) and Ca2+ stores has been proposed as the most likely mechanism to activate this store-mediated Ca2+ entry (SMCE) in several cell types. Here we identify two mechanisms for SMCE in human platelets activated by depletion of two independent Ca2+ pools, which are differentially modulated by the actin cytoskeleton. Ca2+ entry induced by depletion of a 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (TBHQ)-sensitive pool is increased by disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton and that induced by a TBHQ-insensitive pool is reduced. Stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton prevented Ca2+ entry by both mechanisms. We propose that the membrane-associated actin network prevents constitutive Ca2+ entry via both pathways. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton permits the activation of Ca2+ entry via both mechanisms, but only SMCE activated by the TBHQ-insensitive pool requires new actin polymerization, which may support membrane trafficking toward the PM.

Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), although the mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the communication between the intracellular Ca2+ stores and the PM, which can be grouped into two main categories: the conformational or secretion-like coupling hypotheses, which propose physical coupling between elements in the Ca2+ stores and the PM, and diffusible messenger hypotheses, which propose the release of a small molecule from the Ca2+ stores that opens, directly or indirectly, Ca2+ channels in the PM (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar).Recently, the secretion-like coupling model has received support from studies showing that activation of SMCE shares properties with the activation of secretion (3Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

In human platelets, where we have demonstrated a secretion-like coupling mechanism, Ca2+ entry is proposed to be based on reversible trafficking of portions of the Ca2+ stores toward the PM to facilitate de novo coupling between the type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor in the store membrane and naturally expressed human canonical transient receptor potential 1 (hTRPC1) in the PM (8Rosado J.A.

In this process the actin cytoskeleton acts as a negative modulator of the interaction between the Ca2+ store and PM but is also required for activation of SMCE, since cytoskeletal disruption impairs Ca2+ entry (4Rosado J.A.

The 100-kDa isoform, which is inhibited by low concentrations of TG, has been identified as SERCA 2b. The 97-kDa isoform is much less sensitive to TG (11Papp B. Enyedi A. Kovacs T. Sarkadi B.

TBHQ or high concentrations of TG release Ca2+ from one pool (TBHQ-sensitive store with low affinity for TG), while low (about 10 nm) concentrations of TG release Ca2+ from a different compartment (TBHQ-insensitive store with high affinity for TG) (14Cavallini L. Coassin M. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

Briefly, blood was obtained from healthy drug-free volunteers and mixed with ⅙ volume of acid/citrate dextrose anti-coagulant containing (in mm): 85 sodium citrate, 78 citric acid, and 111 d-glucose. Platelet-rich plasma was then prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g, and aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (40 μg/ml) were added. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37 °C with 2 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester for 45 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 20 min and resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.45, containing (in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 Hepes, 10 d-glucose, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4 and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml apyrase.Measurement of Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration ([Ca2+]i)— Fluorescence was recorded from 2-ml aliquots of magnetically stirred platelet suspension (2 × 108 cells/ml) at 37 °C using a Cary Eclipse Spectrophotometer (Varian Ltd., Madrid, Spain) or a Cairn Research Spectrofluorimeter (Cairn Research Ltd., Faversham, UK) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 505 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fura-2 340/380 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Ca2+ entry was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 2.5 min after addition of CaCl2 (4Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 9 min, for TBHQ, or 2.5 min TG or TG + Iono, after Ca2+ or agonist addition. Both Ca2+ entry and release are expressed as nm, as described previously (17Heemskerk J.W. Feijge M.A. Henneman L. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar). When platelets were preincubated with inhibitors, Ca2+ entry was corrected by subtraction of the [Ca2+]i elevation due to leakage of the indicator.To investigate SMCE induced by depletion of TBHQ-sensitive and -insensitive stores individually we followed the procedure depicted in Fig. 2. This protocol consists of depleting the TBHQ-sensitive store to investigate the subsequently induced Ca2+ entry, followed by depletion of the TBHQ-insensitive store using TG + Iono (Fig. 2, B and E) to monitor Ca2+ influx, in this case due to depletion of both stores. Complete depletion of the TBHQ-insensitive store by TG alone required a long exposure to this agent, which might lead to deterioration of the cells; therefore we used TG (100 nm) combined with a low concentration of Iono (20 nm) to induce rapid store depletion. Ca2+ entry activated by the TBHQ-insensitive pool was estimated by subtraction of the increase in [Ca2+] after the addition of Ca2+i to the medium in platelets not stimulated with TG + Iono (Fig. 2, A and D).RESULTSWe have previously shown that treatment of platelets with TG in a Ca2+-free medium results in a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ to the extracellular medium induces a prolonged elevation in [Ca2+]i indicative of SMCE (4Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Rosado J.A. Rosenzweig I. Harding S. Sage S.O. Am. J.

SMCE induced by a short (3 min) treatment with TG was significantly reduced by treatment for 40 min with the actin filament disrupter CytD (10 μm), which abolishes actin polymerization in platelets (18Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 1A, SMCE induced by longer exposures to TG (200 nm) is less sensitive to the disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, and this modification even increases SMCE activated by a 30-min treatment with TG. We also compared the effect of CytD on SMCE induced by treatment with TG (100 nm) alone or together with a low concentration of Iono (20 nm) to accelerate depletion of the Ca2+ stores. Treatment of platelets with CytD did not significantly modify Ca2+ release induced by TG alone or in combination with Iono, suggesting that Ca2+ accumulation is not affected by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1B; n = 6). In CytD-treated platelets TG-induced SMCE was significantly reduced compared with controls (Fig. 1C; p < 0.05; n = 6), whereas SMCE induced by TG + Iono was increased by treatment with CytD (Fig. 1C; p < 0.05; n = 6).Fig. 1The effect of cytochalasin D on SMCE depends on the extent of store depletion. A, fura-2-loaded human platelets were preincubated for 40 min at 37 °C with 10 μm CytD or the vehicle (Me2SO) and then treated in a Ca2+-free medium (200 μm EGTA was added) for various periods of time with TG (200 nm) followed by addition of CaCl2 (final concentration: 300 μm) to initiate Ca2+ entry. Values indicate the percentage of Ca2+ entry under the different experimental conditions relative to their control and are expressed as average ± S.E. from eight to eleven separate experiments. B and C, human platelets were preincubated for 40 min at 37 °C with 10 μm CytD or the vehicle (Me2SO) and then treated in a Ca2+-free medium (200 μm EGTA was added) with TG (100 nm) or TG (100 nm) + Iono (20 nm) followed by addition of CaCl2 (final concentration: 300 μm) 3 min later to initiate Ca2+ entry. Values indicate the percentage of Ca2+ release (B) and entry (C) under the different experimental conditions relative to their control and are expressed as average ± S.E. from six separate experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)There are at least two possible explanations for these observations. Either different Ca2+ entry pathways, which are differentially modulated by the actin cytoskeleton, are activated according to the extent of Ca2+ store depletion, or depletion of different intracellular Ca2+ stores gives rise to the activation of two Ca2+ entry pathways. In the latter case, a short treatment with TG would be expected to affect mainly the Ca2+ stores with high TG affinity, while a prolonged exposure to TG might deplete Ca2+ pools with both high and low affinity for TG.To further investigate this phenomenon we investigated the effects of sequential application of two different SERCA inhibitors, TBHQ and TG. Treatment of platelets with TBHQ induced a concentration-dependent Ca2+ release from a TBHQ-sensitive component of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, reaching a maximal effect at concentrations of 20 μm (data not shown). Ca2+ entry was also maximal after treatment with 20 μm TBHQ (not shown); therefore we used 20 μm TBHQ throughout this study.Treatment of platelets in a Ca2+-free medium (300 μm EGTA was added) with TBHQ (20 μm; Fig. 2) induced a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i; subsequent addition of CaCl2 (500 μm) 9 min later induced a larger, prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i indicative of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 2). The extracellular Ca2+ was chelated 3 min later by addition of EGTA (1 mm), and cells were then treated with TG (100 nm) + Iono (20 nm; Fig. 2, B and E) for a further 5 min or with the vehicle (Me2SO; Fig. 2, A and D). Treatment with TG + Iono induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ release from a TBHQ-insensitive component of the Ca2+ stores. The amount of Ca2+ released by TG + Iono was 5-fold greater than that released by TBHQ, suggesting that the TBHQ-releasable component of the pool is smaller in size than the TBHQ-insensitive component. The subsequent addition of CaCl2 (1.3 mm) resulted in a rise in [Ca2+]i 6-fold higher than that observed when the TBHQ-sensitive component of the stores alone were emptied (Fig. 2, B and E; p < 0.05; n = 6–11). This difference cannot be attributed to a different extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o), since a similar [Ca2+]o was present at the time when SMCE was initiated after depletion of one or both stores, as estimated using an established EGTA/Ca2+ buffer equation (19Tiffert T. Lew V. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This is supported by the similar Ca2+ entries observed on each [Ca2+]o elevation in Fig. 2, A and D, in the absence of TG + Iono.Treatment of human platelets with CytD (10 μm for 40 min) or Lat A (3 μm for 1 h), two unrelated actin polymerization inhibitors, increased TBHQ-induced SMCE by 331 ± 66% and 411 ± 30%, respectively (Fig. 2, A–F; p < 0.05; n = 6). In contrast, SMCE induced following the combined actions of TBHQ, TG, and Iono was reduced (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). SMCE induced by the TBHQ-insensitive component of the stores alone (see “Experimental Procedures”) was reduced by 40 ± 7 and 70 ± 2% in CytD- and Lat A-treated cells, respectively.Statistical Analysis—Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant for a difference.These results suggest against differential depletion of a single intracellular Ca2+ store being responsible for the activation of two pathways for SMCE, which are regulated differently by the actin cytoskeleton. SMCE activated following a small degree of Ca2+ store depletion by treatment with TBHQ was potentiated by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2, A–F), whereas cytoskeletal disruption inhibited SMCE activated following brief treatments with TG (Fig. 1, A and C); potentiation was only observed after more extensive store depletion due to longer exposures to TG (Fig. 1A) or the combined actions of Iono and TG (Fig. 1C). Rather, these results support the hypothesis that two mechanisms for SMCE that are differently regulated by the actin cytoskeleton are activated following depletion of two discrete Ca2+ stores, one with a low sensitivity to TG but sensitive to TBHQ and another that is insensitive to TBHQ but highly sensitive to TG. Thus these two Ca2+ entry pathways appear to be activated by the depletion of the two intracellular Ca2+ stores identified by Cavallini et al. (14Cavallini L. Coassin M. Alexandre A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).We further explored this issue by testing the involvement of the Ras superfamily of proteins in the two pathways for SMCE. Ras family proteins are required for the activation of SMCE in platelets (18Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar) and other cells (20Bird G.S. Putney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In platelets this mechanism involves the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate the involvement of Ras family proteins we used a combination of FTA and AGGC, inhibitors of methylation, and thus activation of prenylated and geranylgeranylated Ras family proteins (18Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 183-192Crossref Google Scholar, 21Xu Y. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1495-1501PubMed Google Scholar). As observed previously with the actin cytoskeleton disrupters, treatment of platelets for 30 min with 40 μm FTA combined with 30 μm AGGC increased TBHQ-induced SMCE by 350 ± 72% (Fig. 3; p < 0.05; n = 8). In contrast, total SMCE induced by depletion of both stores was clearly reduced. SMCE induced by the TBHQ-insensitive store alone was reduced by 52 ± 6% (Fig. 3). As expected, since Ras family proteins participate in the maintenance and the dynamics of the cytoskeletal structure, the effect of these proteins on both Ca2+ entry models is similar to that observed following disruption of the actin cytoskeleton.Fig. 3Role of Ras family proteins in Ca2+ entry induced by depletion of TBHQ-sensitive and -insensitive stores. fura-2-loaded human platelets were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 40 μm FTA plus 30 μm AGGC or the vehicle (Me2SO) as control (bold traces) and then treated in a Ca2+-free medium (300 μm EGTA was added) for 9 min with TBHQ (20 μm) followed by addition of CaCl2 (500 μm) to initiate Ca2+ entry. Extracellular Ca2+ was chelated again by addition of EGTA (final concentration: 1 mm), and then platelets were stimulated in the absence (A) or presence of TG (100 nm) plus Iono (20 nm; B) followed by the addition of CaCl2 (1.3 mm) to allow Ca2+ entry. C, histograms indicate the percentage of Ca2+ entry under the different experimental conditions relative to their control (vehicle was added). Ca2+ entry was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and values are expressed as average ± S.E. from eight independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the “secretion-like coupling” hypothesis, the cortical actin network acts as a clamp that blocks the interaction between the Ca2+ stores and PM; therefore disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton would be expected to facilitate Ca2+ entry. Consistent with this, we have observed an increase in the amount of Ca2+ entry when this event was initiated by depletion of the TBHQ-sensitive stores. In contrast, when the TBHQ-insensitive pool was emptied, actin-depolymerizing agents reduced Ca2+ entry, suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton also plays a positive role in the activation of this mechanism.To investigate whether the membrane-associated cytoskeleton acts as a physical barrier that prevents Ca2+ entry, we used jasplakinolide (JP), a cell-permeant peptide that induces polymerization and redistribution of actin filaments into a thick cortical layer subjacent to the PM (3Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 22Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526: 221-229Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of platelets for 30 min with 10 μm JP significantly reduced SMCE induced by depletion of TBHQ-sensitive and -insensitive stores by 50% (Fig. 4; p < 0.05; n = 5). These observations suggest that the cortical actin cytoskeleton exerts a negative regulatory role on both SMCE pathways, perhaps preventing the coupling between IP3 receptors in the Ca2+ stores and TRP channels in the PM as previously reported (8Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem.

We believe that the secretion-like coupling model explains Ca2+ entry induced by the TBHQ-insensitive store, since it shows high affinity for TG and must be the store affected by short treatments with TG. According to this model, and consistent with the results presented here, the actin cytoskeleton plays a dual role in the activation of SMCE by this pathway: a positive role as a support for the transport of portions of the Ca2+ store to the proximity of the PM to allow coupling to occur, which is impaired by cytoskeletal disrupters, and a negative effect provided by the membrane-associated cytoskeleton to prevent constitutive activation of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 5). In addition, we have described for the first time a new SMCE pathway controlled by a TBHQ-sensitive pool with low affinity for TG where the membrane cytoskeleton acts only as a physical actin barrier to prevent coupling between the Ca2+ stores and PM under resting conditions (Fig. 5). The effect observed with JP suggests that for both SMCE pathways, the cortical actin cytoskeleton must be reorganized when the stores are depleted to facilitate the approach of the Ca2+ stores to the PM. The distinct regulation of both mechanisms might be explained by the stores having different locations. The TBHQ-sensitive store might be close enough to the PM for disruption of the membrane cytoskeleton alone to allow coupling. Coupling must only occur after store depletion however, since disruption of the actin cytoskeleton alone using CytD does not induce this event (9Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Fig. 5Two pathways for SMCE in human platelets. We propose the existence of two mechanisms for SMCE induced by depletion of TBHQ-sensitive and -insensitive stores in platelets as differentiated by the role of the actin cytoskeleton. For Ca2+ entry induced by depletion of TBHQ-sensitive stores, which might be in close apposition with the plasma membrane, the actin filament network acts just as a barrier preventing constitutive coupling between Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane and IP3 receptors in the stores and therefore Ca2+ influx. On the other hand, the actin cytoskeleton plays a dual role in Ca2+ entry induced by depletion of the TBHQ-insensitive pool, acting both as a barrier against constitutive coupling and a support for vesicle trafficking toward the plasma membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This new two-store model for SMCE explains the different effects of CytD on platelets treated for different periods of time with TG or with TG ± Iono. After short treatments with TG alone, SMCE is activated by the TBHQ-insensitive store and therefore is reduced by CytD. When Iono was added together with TG, or after long exposures to TG, both stores were emptied and a combination of effects was observed, and the CytD-induced inhibition of SMCE initiated by the TBHQ-insensitive store is compensated for by the enhanced SMCE activated by the TBHQ-sensitive pool.

Post-translational modifications of histone tails including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and phosphorylation (as well as the lack thereof) have been tightly linked to gene regulation and other chromatin-based processes (1Bernstein B.E.

Accordingly, a combinatorial presence of histone modifications referred to as the histone code has been suggested to provide specific binding sites for proteins involved in the chromatin-signaling network (1Bernstein B.E.

Consistent with both the histone code hypothesis and signaling network model, many bromodomain-containing proteins, including histone acetyltransferases/co-activators and BRD4, associate preferentially with hyperacetylated histones, which are key components of transcriptionally active chromatin (6Dey A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This allows the propagation of the active state by maintaining robust acetylation of chromatin and possibly stabilizing coactivation complexes. On the other hand, methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 by the histone methyltransferase Suv39H1 is a transcriptionally repressive mark of chromatin and creates a binding site for the HP1 protein to establish the heterochromatic state (9Bannister A.

Methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3, however, causes the release of the repressive nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NURD) complex from chromatin (12Nishioka K. Chuikov S. Sarma K.

It is proposed that the histone deacetylase subunit of the Sir complex, known as Sir2, first deacetylates histones, and the resulting hypo- or unacetylated histones subsequently are bound by the Sir3 subunit (15Carmen A.A.

However, the identity of signaling proteins in higher eukaryotes that specifically “translate” the code of the repressive/hypoacetylated state of histones/chromatin is largely unknown. Should such transducer proteins exist in humans, they should associate with “repressive” histone-modifying activities, they must be able to bind to histones, and the robustness of binding should be sensitive to the extent of acetylation. Additionally, such transducer proteins should have a direct transcriptional repressive function and should preferably be released from transcriptionally active promoters. We have previously identified Set (also known as TAF-Iβ) and pp32 as subunits of the INHAT complex with “histone masking” activity, where binding of these proteins to histones prevents their acetylation by transcriptional coactivators (18Seo S. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Here we show that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 have the properties to transduce the code of un- or hypoacetylated chromatin into transcriptional repression in higher eukaryotes. Histone Peptide Binding Assays—[35S]Methionine-labeled pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ were synthesized using pCMX constructs in a coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) and incubated with 0.5 μg of biotin-conjugated histone tail peptides (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., or kindly provided by Dr. M.

Equal amounts of streptavidin-conjugated beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by a phosphorimaging device. Total Histone Binding Assays—Histones were isolated from control HeLa cells or cells grown in 10 mm sodium butyrate using an acid extraction protocol as described (39Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Acetylation of isolated histones was verified by Western blotting with anti-acetyl lysine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal amounts of histones were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated pp32, Set/TAF-Iβ, TAF-Iα, or p300 (amino acids 1062–1143) for 30 min at room temperature in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Anti-histone antibody (MAB3422, Chemicon) was added, and the reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Protein G-agarose beads were added, and the reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After extensive washing, the bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by a phosphorimaging device. Histone Peptide Pull-down Assays—HeLa cell nuclear extract was incubated with equal amounts of biotinylated histone H3 peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. Streptavidin-coated beads were added, and the reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. The antibodies used were anti-pp32 (a kind gift of Dr. G. Pasternack, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), anti-Set/TAF-Iβ and TAF-Iα (a kind gift of Dr. K. Nagata, Tokyo Institute of Technology), and anti-HP1γ and HP1β (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially as described by Hong and Chakravarti (32Hong R. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44505-44513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Antibodies against HDACs 1–7 (Cell Signaling) were used for immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting with anti-pp32 or anti-Set/TAF-Iβ antibodies. GST Pull-down and Histone Deacetylase Assays—Recombinant GST fusion proteins were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract at 4 °C for 3 h and collected on glutathione beads with extensive washing. The bead-bound precipitates were then incubated with 3H-labeled acetylated histones in HDAC assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of stop buffer (1 m HCl, 0.16 m acetic acid). Released 3H was extracted by ethyl acetate and counted in a scintillation counter. Luciferase Assays—A (Gal4 × 5)-TK-luciferase plasmid was stably transfected into 293T cells as described previously (32Hong R. Chakravarti D. J. Biol.

The cells were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with pCMX-GAL4, pCMX-GAL4-pp32, or pCMX-GAL4-Set/TAF-Iβ (50, 100, 200, or 300 ng) (six replicates each). Fortyeight h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed for luciferase assays (Promega). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP was carried out as described in the protocols from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Briefly, 10-cm plates of MCF7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of Myc epitope-tagged pp32 or Set/TAF-Iβ (cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector, Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE 2000. Four h after transfection, the medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum) was replaced with medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped serum and grown for 48 h. Cells were harvested and processed according to the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) or anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and the immunoprecipitates were collected and eluted and their cross-links reversed. The DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and used in PCR reactions with primers specific for the EB1 gene (35Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M.

Because Set/TAF-Iβ and TAF-Iα are identical, except for a short N-terminal portion, we focused our experiments on pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ only. To begin to examine the possibility that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 have the properties required to mediate the transcriptional repression associated with unmodified/hypoacetylated histones, we tested the critical property that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 may bind with different affinities to unacetylated versus acetylated histones. To investigate this possibility, we employed biotin-conjugated covalently modified histone H3 and H4 tail peptides (Fig. 1). We used histone modifications that have been associated with repressed or condensed chromatin (Fig. 1, marked by filled circles) (9Bannister A. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O.

Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96 (C. D.): 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). As expected, and consistent with our previously published histone binding data, both pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ associated strongly with unmodified histone H3 and H4 tails (Fig. 1, a and b). Importantly, this association is highly dependent on the modification state of the histone tail. In addition to unmodified histone H3 and H4 tail peptides, both Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 bound strongly to histone H3 tail peptides methylated at lysine 9 or phosphorylated at serine 10, all modification states known to be associated with transcriptionally silent or condensed chromatin. Hyperacetylated histones are tightly linked to transcriptional activation. Consistent with that view and the proposed roles of both pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ in transcriptional repression, acetylation of lysine residues on the histone H3 or H4 tail greatly weakened or abolished the ability of pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ to associate with histone tails. In general, the robustness of binding is highly dependent on the extent of acetylation. For example, acetylation of a single lysine, such as histone H3 lysine 9 or lysine 14, reduced binding only modestly, but acetylation of both residues completely prevented the association of pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ (Fig. 1a). These results demonstrate that these two proteins preferentially associate with un- or hypoacetylated histones. Consistent with this property, pp32 failed to bind to a histone H3 tail peptide, both phosphorylated at serine 10 and acetylated at lysine 14, a mark for active chromatin (Fig. 1a) (27Lo W. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Similarly pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ bound to unmodified histone H4 peptides and failed to bind tetraacetylated histone H4 peptides (Fig. 1b). Because Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 bound to unmodified/hypoacetylated histone tails, we next investigated its binding properties to differentially acetylated intact histones isolated from cells. To show that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 bind to native histones in an acetylation-sensitive manner, we isolated total histones from control or sodium butyrate (an HDAC inhibitor)-treated cells and utilized these in comparative binding assays. In vitro labeled pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ, individually or together with TAF-Iα, showed significantly stronger binding to hypoacetylated histones isolated from nontreated cells when compared with their binding to histones isolated from treated cells (Fig. 1c, panels I–III). Unlike Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32, a bromodomain-containing region of p300 associated with both of the histone modification states with a preference for hyperacetylated histones, indicating the specificity of binding (Fig. 1c, panel IV). The concentration and acetylation status of the histones isolated from the cells used in this study was verified (Fig. 1c, panel V). We then incubated HeLa cell nuclear extracts with biotinylated histone tail peptides to determine whether endogenous Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 also show a binding specificity for hypoacetylated or repressively marked histones. Endogenous Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32, as well as TAF-Iα, were strongly retained by unmodified and methyl-K9 histone H3 tails but did not associate detectably with acetyl-K9 histone H3 tails (Fig. 1d). These interactions are specific because the control protein HP1 bound to methyl-K9 histone H3 only. However, unlike the HP1 protein, in which histone binding requires the presence of a specific tail modification (methyl-K9 histone H3) (9Bannister A. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar, 10Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar, 11Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar), the ability of Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 to bind histones appears to require the absence of a particular modification (lysine acetylation), with repressive modifications (methylation, phosphorylation) having no apparent negative effect on binding. Together, these results indicate that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 associate with histones in an acetylation-sensitive manner. In yeast, the histone deacetylase Sir2 binds to the silencer protein Sir3, which also binds to hypoacetylated histones to establish and maintain transcriptional repression (15Carmen A.A. Milne L. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4778-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 might associate with one or more HDACs to assist in perpetuating the repressed/hypoacetylated state established by the action of initial chromatin-recruited HDACs. To determine whether Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 function in a similar manner and associate with mammalian HDACs, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Using HeLa cell nuclear extracts and antibodies against HDACs 1 and 4–7 (class I and II HDACs), we consistently detected an interaction between Set/TAF-Iβ and HDAC1 but not HDACs 4–7, indicating the specificity of this interaction (Fig. 2a and data not shown). To demonstrate the recruitment of functional HDAC activity and the general nature of HDACs associated with INHAT subunits, we performed “on beads” histone deacetylase assays using material associated with GST-pp32 in a pull-down experiment (Fig. 2b). GST-pp32 pulled down ∼40-fold greater HDAC activity from HeLa cell nuclear extracts than GST alone. The addition of trichostatin A, a class I and II HDAC inhibitor, completely inhibited the pp32-associated HDAC activity, whereas the addition of nicotinamide, a class III HDAC inhibitor, had only a negligible effect, indicating the specificity of the association. Moreover, a truncated version of GST-pp32 (ΔC2, amino acids 1–150), previously shown to be defective in the inhibition of activated transcription (23Seo S. Macfarlan T. McNamara P. Hong R. Mukai Y. Heo S. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), did not associate with endogenous HDAC activity. Although the precise nature of the HDAC-containing complex requires further characterization, these results together indicate that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 associate with class I and/or II (but not class III) HDAC activities. Association with HDACs and un- or hypoacetylated/repressively marked (but not hyperacetylated) histones provides a plausible mechanism for Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 to mediate transcriptional repression signals by un- or hypoacetylated histones. As mentioned previously, proteins that transduce the repressive code of histones should be able to directly repress transcription when targeted to a promoter in vivo. In yeast, the Tup1 repressor protein binds to hypoacetylated histones and directly represses transcription (31Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To determine whether Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 are capable of directly repressing transcription, we targeted the Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4-DBD) fusions of pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ to the promoter of a stable chromosomally integrated luciferase reporter gene. This stable reporter cell line has previously been utilized to demonstrate transcriptional repression by Gal4-thyroid receptor, Gal4-RevErb, and Gal4-PCNA (32Hong R. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44505-44513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Ishizuka T. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results of our experiments revealed that chromatin targeting of both pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ repressed transcription in a dose-dependent manner in vivo (Fig. 3, a and b). These results indicate that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32, when targeted to a promoter, have the ability to act as direct repressors of chromatin-integrated gene transcription. To show that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 mediate transcriptional repression by hypoacetylated histones in intact cells, it was critical to demonstrate that they associate with hypoacetylated (but not hyperacetylated) chromatin in vivo. However, because of the paucity of known targets and appropriate antibodies, it had been difficult to identify in vivo targets of Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32. Nuclear hormone receptors provide an ideal system to study transcriptional regulation, because unliganded or antagonist-bound receptors are associated with the transcriptionally inactive state of genes, whereas ligand-bound receptors activate transcription (34Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that, in the absence of 17β-estradiol, the promoters of transcriptionally inactive estrogen-responsive genes, including EB1, are hypoacetylated, whereas addition of the ligand causes promoter hyperacetylation and transcriptional activation (35Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 36Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). This, in addition to our observations that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 associate with hypo-, but not hyperacetylated, histones in vitro, prompted us to examine by ChIP their presence at the estrogen hormone-responsive endogenous EB1 gene promoter. MCF7 cells transfected with Myc epitope-tagged pp32 or Set/TAF-Iβ were treated with 17β-estradiol or solvent. ChIP with a Myc antibody revealed that both pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ were present at the endogenous promoter of the estrogen target gene EB1 in untreated cells (Fig. 3c). More importantly, hormone treatment of the cells led to the significant release of pp32 and Set/TAF-Iβ from the promoter (Fig. 3c, compare lanes 5 and 6 with 7 and 8). Although the input levels remained constant, the observable difference in promoter-associated Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 upon hormone treatment also served as a critical internal control. Moreover, control IgG failed to immunoprecipitate the promoter DNA (not shown). In a parallel experiment and consistent with published results, we confirmed by ChIP that the EB1 promoter remains hypoacetylated in untreated cells but is hyperacetylated in cells treated with 17β-estradiol (Fig. 3d, compare lanes 6 and 8). These results, by providing a link between the histone acetylation status of the EB1 promoter and its occupancy by Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32, indicate that these proteins are part of the in vivo transcriptional machinery involved in regulating this estrogen-responsive promoter. Although hypoacetylated histones are tightly linked to transcriptional repression, the in vivo mechanism for such repression in humans has remained largely unknown. Our results uncovered an in vivo role for the INHAT subunits and histone-binding proteins Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 as components of the chromatin-signaling network that translate the transcriptionally repressive “code” of histones. Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 associate in vitro and in vivo preferentially with histones in the hypoacetylated and repressively marked state. Furthermore, the robustness of binding is dictated by the extent of histone acetylation. We present evidence that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 are associated with class I and/or II (but not class III) HDAC activity. Finally, we show that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 are able to directly repress transcription and associate with a promoter specifically in the hypoacetylated state in vivo. This, in addition to their histone binding and HDAC association properties, places them in an ideal position to transduce the transcriptionally repressive signals of hypoacetylated histones in humans. Here we suggest an in vivo role for Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 in integrating histone hypoacetylation and the transcriptionally inactive state in humans by using an estradiol-responsive promoter as an example. In the presence of activating amounts of the ligand estradiol, the promoter is hyperacetylated and therefore prevents the association of a significant quantity of TAF-Iβ and pp32 but promotes the association of bromodomain-containing proteins, including transcriptional coactivators/histone acetyltransferases (Fig. 3, d and e). In the inactive state, the promoter is hypoacetylated and permissive to occupancy by Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 (35Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 36Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, c–e). The HDAC activity associated with Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 may help deacetylate chromatin to further establish the hypoacetylated state, which is subsequently occupied by Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 (Fig. 3e). The concerted action of HDACs and Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32, by a mechanism functionally similar to that of the yeast Sir complex, reinforces the occupancy of the hypoacetylated promoter by Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 via a feed forward mechanism, which maintains the transcriptionally inactive state (Fig. 3e). This is also similar to a feed forward mechanism recently described for the SMRT corepression protein (38Yu J. Li Y. Ishizuka T. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3403-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have identified previously Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 as subunits of the INHAT complex with histone masking activity, where binding of these proteins to histones prevents their acetylation by transcriptional coactivators (Fig. 3e) (18Seo S. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Consistent with our proposed model, it is conceivable that Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 first establish the inactive state of the target genes by the rapid deacetylation of hyperacetylated histones carried out by their associated HDACs. Once histones are deacetylated, Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 tightly associate with them and maintain repression by their histone masking as well as direct repression function (Fig. 3e). In conclusion, this study defines novel in vivo functions of Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32 as mammalian proteins that can potentially mediate transcriptional repression by unmodified or hypoacetylated histones. Future studies investigating additional target genes, as well as pp32- and Set/TAF-Iβ-interacting proteins, will enable us to more precisely define the cellular role these proteins play in transcriptional repression and the mechanisms involved. In addition, we predict that the analysis of other previously known histone-binding proteins may reveal important information on their roles as signal transducer proteins in chromatin-based processes, including histone deposition, DNA replication, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and transcription.

It also was proposed that the N-terminal domain of PIAS1 interacts with DNA as well as p53. Extensive biochemical studies have been devoted recently to understand sumoylations and its biological implications, whereas the structural aspects of the PIAS family and the mechanism of its interactions with various factors are less well known to date. In this study, the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-65) of SUMO ligase PIAS1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure revealed a unique four-helix bundle with a topology of an up-down-extended loop-down-up, a part of which the helix-extended loop-helix represented the SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) motif. Thus, this N-terminal domain may be referred to as a four-helix SAP domain. The glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay demonstrated that this domain possesses a binding ability to tumor suppressor p53, a target protein for sumoylation by PIAS1, whereas gel mobility assays showed that it has a strong affinity toward A/T-rich DNA. An NMR analysis of the four-helix SAP domain complexed with the 16-bp-long DNA demonstrated that one end of the four-helix bundle is the binding site and may fit into the minor groove of DNA. The three-dimensional structure and its binding duality are discussed in conjunction with the biological functions of PIAS1 as a SUMO ligase."
https://openalex.org/W2093163087,"Sulfate transporters in plants and animals are structurally conserved and have an amino-terminal domain that functions in transport and a carboxyl-terminal region that has been designated the STAS domain. The STAS domain in sulfate transporters has significant similarity to bacterial anti-sigma factor antagonists. To determine if the STAS domain has a role in controlling the activity of sulfate transporters, their stability, or their localization to the plasma membrane, we examined the effect of deleting or modifying the STAS domain of dominant sulfate transporters in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. The A. thaliana Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1 sulfate transporters rescue the methionine-dependent growth phenotype of the yeast sulfate transporter mutant strain CP154-7B. Constructs of Sultr1;2 in which the STAS domain was deleted (ΔSTAS) resulted in synthesis of a truncated polypeptide that was unable to rescue the CP154-7B phenotype. The inability of these constructs to rescue the mutant phenotype probably reflected both low level cellular accumulation of the transporter and the inability of the truncated protein to localize to the plasma membrane. Fusing the STAS domain from other sulfate transporters to Sultr1;2 ΔSTAS constructs restored elevated accumulation and plasma membrane localization, although the kinetics of sulfate uptake in the transformants were markedly altered with respect to transformants synthesizing wild-type Sultr1;2 protein. These results suggest that the STAS domain is essential, either directly or indirectly, for facilitating localization of the transporters to the plasma membrane, but it also appears to influence the kinetic properties of the catalytic domain of transporters.

Sulfate transporters constitute a large family of anion transporters (SLC26 or SulP family, transport commission no. 2.A.53) present in bacteria, fungi, plants, and mammals (1Saito K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Hawkesford M.J. Physiol. Plantarum. 2003; 117: 155-163Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3Busch W. Saier M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 287-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These proteins function in the transport of anions such as sulfate, chloride, and carbonate, and their structure is highly conserved. They all have an amino-terminal region with ∼12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist; SD media, synthetic defined media; sGFP, synthetic green fluorescent protein; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; Pma1p, H+-ATPase1 protein; Dpm1p, dolichol phosphate mannose synthase 1 protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; STAS, sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist; SD media, synthetic defined media; sGFP, synthetic green fluorescent protein; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; Pma1p, H+-ATPase1 protein; Dpm1p, dolichol phosphate mannose synthase 1 protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin. followed by a linking region that connects to a carboxyl-terminal STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist) domain; the STAS domain extends into the cytoplasm of the cell. Interestingly, this domain shares significant similarity with bacterial anti-sigma factor antagonists such as SpoIIAA of Bacillus subtilis (4Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R53-R55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SpoIIAA is a small polypeptide that interacts with the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB, freeing the sigma factor to function in directing RNA polymerase activity, which in turn facilitates sporulation (5Ho M.S. Carniol K. Losick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20898-20905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the exact function of the STAS domain associated with eukaryotic anion transporters has not been elucidated, mutations in STAS domains of members of the sulfate transporter family result in serious diseases, including diastrophic dysplasia, Pendred syndrome, and congenital chloride diarrhea. These findings suggest that the STAS domain contributes to the catalytic, biosynthetic, or regulatory aspects of anion transporters (6Superti-Furga A. Rossi A. Steinmann B. Gitzelmann R. Am. J. Med.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).Although the function of the catalytic domain of anion transporters such as SHST1 from the legume Styloxanthes hamata has been probed over the last few years (12Khurana O.K. Coupland L.A. Shelden M.C. Howitt S.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Shelden M.C. Loughlin P. Tierney M.L. Howitt S.M. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12941-12949Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), few biochemical studies have been performed to evaluate STAS domain function. In one study of the hDRA gene (SLC26A3) of humans, which encodes an anion transporter that mediates Cl--Cl- and Cl−-HCO3− exchange in Xenopus oocytes, removal of the STAS domain abolished anion transport activity (15Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Shmukler B.E. Schweinfest C.W. Blanco P. Freedman S.D. Stewart A.K. Alper S.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Hence, whereas the STAS domain does seem to influence transport function, its exact role in modulating transport-associated events, whether catalytic or regulatory, is still not known.Arabidopsis thaliana has 14 genes that encode five phylogenetic categories of putative sulfate transporters (2Hawkesford M.J. Physiol. Plantarum. 2003; 117: 155-163Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). All but two of these putative transporter proteins contain STAS domains. We have focused our studies on Sultr1;2, a dominant sulfate transporter in the roots of A. thaliana. Selenate-resistant mutants (sel1) of A. thaliana have been isolated that have lesions in the Sultr1;2 gene (16Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Of the mutant strains characterized, three out of five had changes in amino acids in the region of Sultr1;2 connecting the terminal transmembrane domain (TMD12) to the STAS domain (17Shibagaki N. Rose A. Fujiwara T. Davies J.P. Grossman A.R. Davidian J.-C. Grill D. De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Hawkesford M.J. Schnug E. Rennenberg H. Sulfur Transport and Assimilation in Plants: Regulation, Interaction, Signaling. Backhuys, Leiden2003: 323-325Google Scholar). These results, plus the results that correlate STAS domain mutations with specific diseases in humans, suggest that the STAS domain and its orientation with respect to the catalytic domain may contribute to the activity/regulation associated with anion transporters.To dissect the role of the STAS domain in sulfate transport function, we examined the activity of the A. thaliana sulfate transporter Sultr1;2, and modified versions of this transporter, in yeast cells null for sulfate transport activity (CP154-7B) (18Cherest H. Davidian J.-C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The STAS domains on Sultr1;2 were deleted or exchanged with STAS domains of other A. thaliana sulfate transporters, the chimeric proteins expressed in CP154-7B, and the ability of these proteins to rescue the mutant phenotype was evaluated. We also defined the kinetic characteristics of the modified transporters and determined their subcellular locations. These studies demonstrate that the STAS domain and the region that links the STAS domain to the catalytic domain are necessary, either directly or indirectly, for the correct and/or stable localization of the Sultr1;2 protein in the yeast plasma membrane, and that STAS domains from different sulfate transporter proteins can markedly affect the kinetic characteristics of transporter activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains—The strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in this study were CP154-7B (MATα, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, sul1::LEU2, sul2::URA3), which is null for both the Sul1 and Sul2 sulfate transporter genes (18Cherest H. Davidian J.-C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the parental strain W303 (MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3). Both strains were supplied by the Yeast Genetic Stock Center. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium-acetate method described by Rose (19Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1990Google Scholar).Growth of S. cerevisiae Cultures—S. cerevisiae cells used for subcellular fractionation, characterization of membrane polypeptides, and assays for quantification of cell growth rate and sulfate uptake activity were grown at 30 °C in synthetic defined (SD), liquid medium containing 50 μm MgSO4, and supplemented with methionine, as indicated in the text. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of the cultures at 600 nm (A600) in a DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA).Sulfate Uptake—The uptake of sulfate was assayed in exponentially growing cells (A600 < 0.4). Prior to the assay, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (2000 × g), washed twice with sulfate-free SD medium, re-suspended to an A600 of 1.6–2.0, and incubated at 30 °C with continuous shaking at 220 rpm. Two milliliters of cell suspension was transferred to a water-jacketed vessel maintained at 30 °C and continually stirred, and the uptake reaction was initiated with the addition of different concentrations of 35SO42− (0.2–100 μm) at a specific activity of 189 mCi/mol. Aliquots of 200 μl were removed from the reaction vessel at five different times between 10 and 120 s following the addition of 35SO42−, and the cells in these aliquots were collected on 0.45-μm HA nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by vacuum filtration using an FH225V filter manifold (Amersham Biosciences) and immediately washed with 10 ml of ice-cold YPD medium (containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose). The filters were then immersed in a scintillation mixture (Ecolume, E&K, Campbell, CA) and radioactivity retained by the cells quantified in a Beckman-Coulter scintillation counter (Model LS6500).Construction of HA-tagged Polypeptides Encoding Sulfate Transporters—Plasmids for the expression of the carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged sulfate transporters were constructed in pYX222x (16Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing Sultr1;2-HA, Sultr1;1-HA, and Sultr3;1-HA were made by ligating the RT-PCR-amplified coding region of each gene into pYX222x yielding a carboxyl-terminal fusion of the HA epitope to the coding region of the transporter. The primers used were Sultr1;2-FEco (5′-atagaattcatgtcgtcaagagctcaccc-3′), Sultr1;2-RSal (5′-actaagtcgacttccgacctcgttggagag-3′), Sultr1;1-FEco (5′-ccggaattcatgtccgggactattaatccc-3′), Sultr1;1-RSal (5′-actaagtcgacaagtttgttgctcagccacttcc-3′), Sultr3;1-FEco (5′-agtgaattcatgggcacggaggactacac-3′), and Sultr3;1-RSal (5′-ataaagtcgacatacgttgttccaaggctcgtt-3′). The plasmid containing Sultr1; 2-HA was digested to completion with SalI and partially digested with PstI, enabling us to replace the STAS domain of Sultr1;2 with the STAS domains of Sultr1;1 and Sultr3;1; the chimeric proteins generated were designated Sultr1;2–1;1 and Sultr1;2–3;1, respectively. The primers used to amplify the specific STAS domain encoding regions were Sultr1; 1-STAS-FPst (5′-agaactgcagttctagggaagctgccaaa-3′), Sultr3;1-STAS-FPst (5′-aaaactgcagtgaagggaaacataccaaac-3′), and Sultr1;1-RSal and Sultr3;1-RSal, as shown above. Digestion of the vector containing Sultr1;2-HA with EcoRI and partial digestion with PstI allowed for the replacement of the region of Sultr1;2 containing the twelve predicted TMDs with the analogous region from Sultr1;1, yielding the plasmid containing Sultr1;1–1;2. The primers used were Sultr1;1-FEco (as shown above) and Sultr1;1–500TRPst (5′-attctgcagttcttggtctcgtcacttg-3′). A schematic representation of the different STAS domain constructs and the exact sites of fusion between the TMD domains of the transporters with the STAS domains are given in Fig. 1. For construction of Sultr1;2 fused to the synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) and HA (Sultr1;2-sGFP), the DNA fragment for the entire coding region of Sultr1;2 was amplified by PCR with the primers, Sultr1;2-FEco (as shown above) and Sultr1;2-RNco10A (5′-aataaccatggcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcagcgacctcgttggattttgg-3′), digested with EcoRI and NcoI, and cloned into pTH2 (20Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), which generated Sultr1;2–10 alanine repeat (linker)-sGFP. The resulting plasmid served as template for PCR using the primer set Sultr1;2-FEco (as shown above) and sGFP-RSal (5′-actaagtcgacttgccttgtacagctcgtc-3′). The fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into pYX222x. All of the constructs were sequenced to ensure that no change was introduced in either the coding regions of the genes or the insert-vector junctions.Microscopy—Strains expressing Sultr1;2-sGFP were grown in liquid medium to mid-logarithmic phase and mounted onto slides, and sGFP fluorescence was imaged using a Nikon TMD200 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon 60× 1.2-numerical aperture water immersion objective and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal head.Polypeptide Analyses—Cells in mid-logarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.2–0.3) were chilled at 4 °C, harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min), washed once in ice-cold wash solution (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm sodium azide, 10 mm potassium fluoride), resuspended in cold TE-buffered 20% sucrose containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8215), and then disrupted by agitation with glass beads (425–600 μm). The protein concentration of the lysate was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Ten μg of protein was used for analyses of total cellular protein by SDS-PAGE (see below). To fractionate lysed cells into different subcellular compartments, lysates containing 600 μg of total protein was loaded onto a 5-ml, 30–60% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 4 °C for 19 h at 31,000 rpm in the SW-60 rotor (Beckman Coulter). The gradient was separated into 13 fractions of equal volume, and an equal volume of loading buffer (6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 6 m urea, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) was added to both total cell lysate and to each of the fractions from the sucrose gradient. The samples were heated at 37 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at full speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 2 min to remove insoluble material, and then the solubilized polypeptides were resolved on a 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). Resolved polypeptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using a semi-dry transfer method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the polypeptides with a carboxyl-terminal HA tag were immunodetected by reacting the membranes with anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), followed by treatment with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Sigma). Peroxidase activity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). Specific antibodies raised to H+ ATPase1 (Pma1p), a plasma membrane marker, were obtained from Dr. Carolyn W. Slayman, Yale University, whereas antibodies against the dolichol phosphate mannose synthase 1 (Dpm1p), an endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ER) marker, were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Signal strength was quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).RESULTSRescue of Yeast sul1 sul2 Mutant by A. thaliana Sulfate Transporter Genes and Requirement for the STAS Domain—A S. cerevisiae mutant null for Sul1 and Sul2 sulfate transporter genes, designated CP154-7B, is unable grow on medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source, but grows rapidly in medium supplemented with methionine (18Cherest H. Davidian J.-C. Thomas D. Benes V. Ansorge W. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1997; 145: 627-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of plant sulfate transporter genes have been shown to rescue this mutant to sulfate prototrophy (22Yoshimoto N. Takahashi H. Smith W.S. Yamaya T. Saito K. Plant J. 2002; 29: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi H. Watanabe-Takahashi A. Smith F. Blake-Kalff M. Hawkesford M.J. Saito K. Plant J. 2000; 23: 171-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the sulfate transporters of plants can be synthesized in yeast cells and localized to their site of function (2Hawkesford M.J. Physiol. Plantarum. 2003; 117: 155-163Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Yoshimoto N. Takahashi H. Smith W.S. Yamaya T. Saito K.

A. 1995; 92: 9373-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that the A. thaliana sulfate transporters Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1 were able to complement the yeast CP154-7B mutant, and this heterologous system was used to determine the kinetic characteristics associated with this and other transporters (22Yoshimoto N. Takahashi H. Smith W.S. Yamaya T. Saito K. Plant J. 2002; 29: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi H. Watanabe-Takahashi A. Smith F. Blake-Kalff M. Hawkesford M.J. Saito K. Plant J. 2000; 23: 171-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To evaluate the role of the STAS domain of A. thaliana sulfate transporters on transporter activity, abundance and subcellular location in the heterologous yeast system, we modified the Sultr1;2 gene in various ways and transformed it into CP154-7B cells. Most of our work focused on Sultr1;2, because it is a major transporter that functions in the roots of A. thaliana, and several mutations that alter the activity of this protein have been previously identified (16Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Shibagaki N. Rose A. Fujiwara T. Davies J.P. Grossman A.R. Davidian J.-C. Grill D. De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Hawkesford M.J. Schnug E. Rennenberg H. Sulfur Transport and Assimilation in Plants: Regulation, Interaction, Signaling. Backhuys, Leiden2003: 323-325Google Scholar). We also chose to use the STAS domains of Sultr1;1, a sulfate transporter in the same group as Sultr1;2, and Sultr3;1, a transporter in a different group, to determine if the STAS domain of the different transporters influence transporter activity or localization within the cell. Sultr1;2 and Sultr1;1 are high affinity, closely related transporters with an amino acid similarity (identity) of 80% (69%). In contrast, the amino acid similarity (identity) between Sultr3;1 and Sultr1;2/Sultr1;1 is 69% (51%)/67% (49%). Furthermore, Sultr1;1 and Sultr1;2 are co-expressed in root cortex cells while Sultr3;1 is expressed specifically in leaves (22Yoshimoto N. Takahashi H. Smith W.S. Yamaya T. Saito K. Plant J. 2002; 29: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Takahashi H. Sasakura N. Kimura A. Watanabe A. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 686Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although Sultr1;2 is expressed constitutively, with some increase in the transcript level in response to sulfur deprivation, Sultr1;1 expression dramatically increases when plants are deprived of sulfate (22Yoshimoto N. Takahashi H. Smith W.S. Yamaya T. Saito K. Plant J. 2002; 29: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).The coding regions of the sulfate transporter genes, derived from specific cDNAs, were separately cloned into the yeast expression vector, pYX222x (16Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which was then used to transform CP154-7B. pYX222x is a high copy number plasmid vector with the 2-μm origin of replication and the HIS3 gene as a selection marker. Within this vector the inserted gene was fused at the carboxyl-terminal to the HA epitope tag. As shown qualitatively in Fig. 2, the HA-tagged Sultr1;1 and Sultr1;2, but not Sultr3;1, rescued the mutant phenotype allowing it to grow on medium in which sulfate was the sole sulfur source. A quantitative evaluation of the growth of the rescued strain on sulfate-containing, liquid medium, either with or without methionine supplementation, is shown in Fig. 3. Table I shows the doubling time of the different strains and transformants. In medium supplemented with methionine, transformants harboring the cDNAs for the three different transporters (Sultr1;2, Sultr1;1, and Sultr3;1) grew at rates that ranged from 65–75% of that of the parental strain (W303; the strain used to generate CP154-7B, carrying pYX222x to complement histidine auxotrophy) and attained a cell density of ∼50% that of the parental strain (Fig. 3, lower panel, and Table I). In contrast, in medium devoid of methionine, the CP154-7B mutant was rescued by introduction of the Sultr1;2 or Sultr1;1 genes, but not by introduction of the Sultr3;1 gene (Fig. 3, upper panel, and Table I). Those transformants harboring the Sultr1;2 or Sultr1;1 genes grew on medium with sulfate as the sole sulfur source at rates of ∼50% of that of W303; generally, CP154-7B harboring Sultr1;2 grew slightly faster than CP154-7B harboring Sultr1;1.Fig. 2The growth of CP154-7B cells on plates expressing unmodified, truncated, and chimeric sulfate transporters.

The limits of the STAS domain were defined by homology to the anti-sigma factor antagonist SpoIIAA (4Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R53-R55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most carboxyl-terminal TMD of Sultr1;2 (TMD12) is predicted to end at serine 490 (490S) based on MEMSAT2 (26Jones S. Stewart M. Michie A. Swindells M.B. Orengo C. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and homology to SpoIIAA starts at glutamine (522Q) and ends at leucine (649L), as defined by PROSITE (PS50801) (Fig. 1B). Two different “Sultr1;2ΔSTAS” constructs were tested for their ability to complement the CP154-7B mutant; in “Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-1” and “Sultr1;2ΔSTAS-2” the constructs encode truncated Sultr1;2 proteins that terminate at serine (492S) and tyrosine (517Y), respectively (Fig. 1). The Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-1 protein lacks the entire STAS domain as well as the amino acids that comprise the region that links the TMDs of the transporter to the STAS domain, whereas the Sultr1; 2ΔSTAS-2 protein lacks the STAS domain but contains nearly all of the linking region. Neither of these constructs was able to rescue the CP154-7B mutant phenotype in medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source (Figs. 2 and 3, upper panel). However, in methionine-supplemented medium, CP154-7B transformed with these constructs grew essentially as well as CP154-7B transformed with the entire Sultr1;2 gene or empty vector (Fig. 3, lower panel). These results raised the possibilities that the truncated protein products were nonfunctional, could not localize to their site of action or were more unstable than the full-length Sultr1;2 protein.To test if the STAS domain from one of the sulfate transporters could functionally substitute for that of another, we constructed three chimeric genes in which STAS domains among the different sulfate transport polypeptides were exchanged (see Fig. 1). Truncated Sultr1;2 (at alanine 506) was fused with the STAS domain from Sultr1;1 (at valine 502 to threonine 649) and Sultr3;1 (valine 498 to valine 658) to yield Sultr1;2–1;1 and Sultr1;2–3;1. Additionally, the truncated Sultr1;1 polypeptide (at threonine 500) was fused to the STAS domain of Sultr1;2 (alanine 506 to valine 653) to yield Sultr1;1–1;2 (Fig. 1). All the chimeric proteins were HA-tagged at their carboxyl termini. The yeast cells expressing Sultr1;2–1;1 grew as well as those expressing the full-length Sultr1;2 polypeptide in medium lacking methionine, while there was essentially no growth of cells expressing Sultr1;1–1;2 or Sultr1;2–3;1 (Fig. 3, upper panel). All of the strains with the chimeric constructs grew in methionine-supplemented medium at rates comparable to that of CP154-7B transformant with the entire Sultr1;2 gene or the empty vector (Fig. 3, lower panel).Sulfate Transport Kinetics in Yeast Transformants—We performed sulfate uptake assays with parental W303 cells carrying the plasmid pYX22"
https://openalex.org/W2084568377,"Ongoing spontaneous activity in the cerebral cortex exhibits complex spatiotemporal patterns in the absence of sensory stimuli. To elucidate the nature of this ongoing activity, we present a theoretical treatment of two contrasting scenarios of cortical dynamics: (1) fluctuations about a single background state and (2) wandering among multiple “attractor” states, which encode a single or several stimulus features. Studying simplified network rate models of the primary visual cortex (V1), we show that the single state scenario is characterized by fast and high-dimensional Gaussian-like fluctuations, whereas in the multiple state scenario the fluctuations are slow, low dimensional, and highly non-Gaussian. Studying a more realistic model that incorporates correlations in the feed-forward input, spatially restricted cortical interactions, and an experimentally derived layout of pinwheels, we show that recent optical-imaging data of ongoing activity in V1 are consistent with the presence of either a single background state or multiple attractor states encoding many features."

Glycoprotein E2 comprises a receptor-binding domain (residues 384–661) that is connected to the transmembrane domain (residues 716–746) via a highly conserved sequence containing a hydrophobic heptad repeat (residues 675–699). Alanine- and proline-scanning mutagenesis of the E2 heptad repeat revealed that Leu675, Ser678, Leu689, and Leu692 are important for E1E2 heterodimerization. Furthermore, Pro and Ala substitution of all but one heptad repeat residue (Ser678) blocked the entry of E1E2-HIV-1 pseudotypes into Huh7 cells, irrespective of an effect on heterodimerization. Two conserved prolines (Pro676 and Pro683), occupying consecutive b positions of the heptad, were not required for E1E2 heterodimerization; however, Pro683 was critical for viral entry. Thus, disruption of the predicted α-helical structure by proline at position 683 is important for E2 function. The inability of mutants to mediate viral entry was not explained by a loss of receptor binding function, because all mutants were able to interact with a recombinant form of the CD81 large extracellular loop. Chimeras formed between the E1 and E2 ectodomains and the transmembrane domains of flavivirus prM and E glycoproteins, respectively, were able to heterodimerize, although with lower efficiency in comparison with wild type E1E2. The heptad repeat of E2 therefore requires the native transmembrane domain for full heterodimerization and viral entry function.

Currently, no vaccine exists to prevent infection, and therapeutic agents such as pegylated interferon and ribavirin have limited success in achieving viral clearance. A more complete understanding of the viral life cycle, including viral entry, is essential so that new targets for viral inhibition are found.HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses and encodes two viral envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. E1 and E2 are cleaved cotranslationally from a polyprotein precursor, forming covalently and noncovalently associated heterodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum. A small proportion of noncovalently associated heterodimers enter the secretory pathway to become surface expressed (1Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The surface-expressed E1E2 heterodimer represents a functional glycoprotein form because it can mediate entry of E1E2-retrovirus pseudotypes into hepatic cells (1Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 3Hsu M.

Inhibitors of vacuolar acidification block the entry of E1E2-retrovirus pseudotypes into Huh7 cells (3Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The functional role of E1 is unknown; however, its association with E2 is essential for viral entry (1Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 3Hsu M.

Allison S.L. Heinz F.X. Helenius A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5480-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Glycoprotein E has the dual functions of receptor binding and membrane fusion (9Allison S.L. Schalich J. Stiasny K. Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4268-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), whereas prM appears to protect E from premature fusion activation during passage through the secretory pathway (8Lorenz I.C. Allison S.L. Heinz F.X. Helenius A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5480-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A soluble 395-amino acid fragment of E, containing the receptor-binding domain and fusion peptide, can be cleaved by trypsin from purified flavivirus (e.g. tick-borne encephalitis virus) (10Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography has revealed that this soluble E fragment is composed of three subdomains (I, II, and II) that are rich in β-sheets, typical of class II fusion proteins (10Rey F.A. Heinz F.X. Mandl C. Kunz C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, E monomers are arranged as head-to-tail dimers, lying parallel to the viral membrane (12Ferlenghi I. Clarke M. Ruttan T. Allison S.L. Schalich J. Heinz F.X. Harrison S.C. Rey F.A. Fuller S.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Exposure to low pH causes a reorientation of the three subdomains such that domain II tilts up toward the target membrane for fusion loop insertion and E dimers reassemble into trimers (13Bressanelli S. Stiasny K. Allison S.L. Stura E.A. Duquerroy S. Lescar J. Heinz F.X. Rey F.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This soluble fragment of E is connected to the transmembrane domain (TMD) via an ∼50-amino acid”stem“. The stem of tick-borne encephalitis virus E comprises two putative α-helices: a membrane-proximal C-terminal helix contributes to prM-E heterodimer stability at neutral pH, and an N-terminal helix promotes trimer formation at low pH (14Allison S.L. Stiasny K. Stadler K. Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5605-5612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of the stem, E trimerization triggered by low pH is dependent on the presence of lipid (14Allison S.L. Stiasny K. Stadler K. Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5605-5612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).An HCV E2 fragment comprised of residues 384–661 (E2661) may be homologous to the soluble ectodomain fragment of E (15Yagnik A.T. Lahm A. Meola A. Roccasecca R.M. Ercole B.B. Nicosia A. Tramontano A. Proteins. 2000; 40: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). E2661 mediates binding to a variety of cellular receptors, including CD81 and scavenger receptor type B class I, that play important roles in viral entry, possibly in a coreceptor complex (16Bartosch B. Vitelli A. Granier C. Goujon C. Dubuisson J. Pascale S. Scarselli E. Cortese R. Nicosia A. Cosset F.L. J. Biol.

In addition, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to epitopes located within E2661 can neutralize the infectivity of E1E2-pseudotyped particles into Huh7 cells, with low pH altering the exposure of mAb epitopes (3Hsu M.

Like its putative flaviviral counterpart, E2661 is linked to the TMD through a conserved sequence that is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix containing a hydrophobic heptad repeat (Fig. 1). In this study, we have shown by proline- and alanine-scanning mutagenesis that this heptad repeat sequence is important for E1E2 heterodimerization and for entry of E1E2-pseudotyped HIV-1 particles into Huh7 cells. We propose that the heptad repeat region of HCV E2 is a functional homolog of the flavivirus glycoprotein E stem.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Antibodies—HEK 293T, Huh7, and Cos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine (DMF10).

Briefly, supernatants from HEK 293T cells co-transfected with an E1E2 expression vector or cDNA4 empty vector and pNL4–3.LUC.R–E– were filtered (0.45 μm) and applied to Huh7 cell monolayers. Luciferase was measured with a Microlumat LB (Berthold) luminometer or Polarstar (BMG labtechnologies) fitted with luminescence optics using the Promega luciferase reagent system.Analysis of E1E2-HIV-1 Pseudotypes—293T cells, seeded at 350,000 cells/well in 6-well culture dishes, were transfected with 1 μg each of pNL4–3.LUC.R–E– and pE1E2H77c or empty pCDNA4HisMax vector. 24 h later, cells were starved of methionine and cysteine by culturing for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-deficient DMF10 (ICN). Cells were labeled with 150 μCi of Tran-35S-label (ICN) in methionine/cysteinedeficient DMF10 for at least 4 h and then chased in complete medium for a further 24 h. The tissue culture fluid was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and radiolabeled viruses were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pelleted virions were lysed in RIP lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with mAb H53 or IgG from an HIV-1-infected individual prior to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimage analysis.Solid Phase E1E2-CD81 Binding Assay—The expression and purification of a chimera composed of maltose-binding protein linked to CD81 large extracellular loop residues 113–201 (MBP-LEL113–201) has been described previously (4Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11143-11147Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 96-well maxisorb enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nunc) were coated with 5 μg/ml dimeric MBP-LEL113–201 in phosphate-buffered saline overnight, followed by blocking of uncoated sites with bovine serum albumin solution (10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h. The plates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. E1E2-HIV-1 pseudotypes were pelleted from the tissue culture medium by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 h, lysed in RIP lysis buffer, applied at various dilutions to MBP-LEL113–201-coated plates, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, bound E2 was detected with mAb H53 and rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO). The plates were developed with tetramethylbenzidine substrate according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma) and read at 450 nm.RESULTSLeu675, Ser678, Leu689, and Leu692 of the Membrane-proximal Heptad Repeat Region of E2 Are Essential for E1E2 Heterodimerization—A highly conserved hydrophobic heptad repeat (residues 675–699) is encompassed by the sequence linking E2661 to the TMD (Fig. 1). The algorithm of Combet et al. (22Combet C. Blanchett C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar) predicts that the E2 heptad repeat region will form an amphipathic α-helix on the C-terminal side of two conserved proline residues, Pro676 and Pro683, that occupy consecutive b positions. A conserved heptad repeat of similar length is also found in the membrane-proximal stem region of flaviviral E glycoproteins (Fig. 1), playing an important role in prM-E heterodimerization (14Allison S.L. Stiasny K. Stadler K. Mandl C.W. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5605-5612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of the HCV E2 hydrophobic heptad repeat, we performed alanine- and proline-scanning mutagenesis of the a and d positions in the context of an E1E2 polyprotein expression vector, pE1E2H77c (1Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).We first examined how the mutations affected the synthesis and assembly of E1 and E2 into noncovalently associated heterodimers. Transfected cells were pulse-chase biosynthetically labeled, and E1E2 heterodimers were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the conformation-dependent anti-E2 mAb H53. Immunoprecipitations were analyzed using SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Fig. 2A, RIP, shows that reduced levels of E1 were coprecipitated with E2 when Leu675, Ser678, Leu689, and Leu692 were mutated to proline, indicating that heterodimerization is blocked by these mutations. Western blotting of the same lysates with an anti-E1 mAb (A4) revealed similar levels of E1 expression for all mutants (Fig. 2A, Western blot). These results indicate that the L675P, S678P, L689P, and L692P mutations did not indirectly affect E1 expression and/or stability. In most cases, the effects of alanine substitutions were similar to those observed with proline. Serine 678 was an exception; the proline mutant lacked heterodimerization ability, whereas the Ala mutant exhibited wild type levels of E1E2 heterodimer formation (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A, RIP, heterodimerization of E1E2 heptad repeat mutants in cell lysates. Metabolically labeled lysates of 293T cells transfected with wild type (WT), mutated pE1E2H77c, or empty cDNA4 vector (no E1E2) were immunoprecipitated with the conformation-dependent anti-E2 mAb H53.

Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The surface-expressed E1E2 heterodimer represents a functional glycoprotein form because it can mediate viral entry when incorporated into retroviruses (1Drummer H.E. Maerz A. Poumbourios P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 3Hsu M.

We employed the E1E2-HIV-1 pseudotyping system to ask whether the heptad repeat mutations affect the functional E1E2 heterodimer. 293T cells were cotransfected with pE1E2H77c and pNL4.3LUC.R–E– vectors and pulse-chase biosynthetically labeled. E1E2 heterodimers were immunoprecipitated from lysed viral pellets with mAb H53 prior to SDS-PAGE. Similar levels of wild type and mutated E2 were incorporated into HIV-1 particles (Fig. 2B). As was observed for the intracellular glycoprotein complex, S678P, L689P, and L692P also blocked heterodimerization with E1 in a viral context (Fig. 2B). The L675P mutation, which exhibited diminished intracellular E1E2 heterodimerization, caused complete blockade of glycoprotein heterodimerization in a viral context. Proline at 675 is therefore not tolerated in the mature glycoprotein complex. The Ala substitutions were less severe than corresponding Pro mutations, with L675A, L689A, and L692A substitutions reducing the amount of E1 present in viral E1E2 heterodimers. Immunoprecipitation of virus lysates with IgG from an HIV-1-infected individual indicated that the HIV-1 gag structural proteins and pol replicative enzymes were incorporated at similar levels for wild type and all mutants (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the membrane-proximal heptad repeat region of E2 is a determinant of E1E2 heterodimerization involving Leu675, Ser678, Leu689, and Leu692.Entry of E1E2-HIV-1 Pseudotypes into Huh7 Cells—E1E2-pseudotyped retroviral particles are competent to enter hepatic cells via the endosomal pathway. Viral entry requires both E1 and E2 and can be blocked by mAbs to E2, by serum or plasma from HCV-infected individuals, and by soluble CD81 receptor (2Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 3Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7271-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). We used the E1E2-HIV-1 luciferase reporter pseudotyping system to determine whether the heptad repeat mutations affected the ability of E1E2 to mediate viral entry into Huh7 cells. Fig. 3, A and B, indicates that Pro and Ala substitution of all but one heptad repeat residue (Ser678) abolished viral entry competence, irrespective of an effect on E1E2 heterodimerization. In the case of Ser678, the Pro mutation blocked both E1E2 heterodimerization and viral entry competence, whereas S678A was associated with the incorporation of wild type levels of E1E2 heterodimer into entrycompetent virus.Fig. 3A, entry of wild type (WT) and proline-mutated E1E2-HIV-1 pseudotypes into Huh7 cells. The data represent the percentage entry of mutant versus wild type (means ± S.E.; representative of two independent experiments performed in quadruplicate).

Virol. 2004; 78: 1448-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether mutated HCV glycoproteins derived from HIV-1 pseudotypes retained CD81 binding ability. Viral lysates were titrated against a recombinant form of the CD81 large extracellular loop, MBP-LEL113–201, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (4Drummer H.E. Wilson K.A. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11143-11147Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Bound HCV glycoproteins were detected with the conformation-dependent anti-E2 mAb, H53. Lysates of E1E2-pseudotyped particles with mutations in the E2 heptad repeat retained comparable CD81 binding ability, although slight reductions in binding were observed for the L675P and S678P mutants (Figs. 4, A and B), which are incorporated at lower levels into particles (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the heptad repeat mutations did not significantly alter the CD81 binding site of E2. The inability of E1E2-HIV-1 pseudotypes to enter Huh7 cells is therefore most likely related to defective heterodimerization for the L675P/A, S678P, L689P/A, and L692P/A mutants or a defect at a post-CD81 binding stage of entry, such as membrane fusion, for the remaining entry-incompetent mutants.Fig. 4Binding of E1E2-HIV-1-pseudotyped particle lysates containing proline (A) or alanine (B) mutations to recombinant LEL of CD81 (MBP-LEL113–201).

Mutation of either proline to alanine did not affect E1E2 heterodimer formation (Fig. 5A), E1 biosynthesis (Fig. 5B), or incorporation of E1E2 heterodimers into pseudotyped HIV-1 particles (Fig. 5C). Similar amounts of the HIV-1 structural proteins were incorporated into pseudotyped particles in all cases (Fig. 5D). However, the P683A mutation abolished the ability of E1E2-pseudotyped HIV-1 particles to enter Huh7 cells, whereas P676A did not significantly affect entry competence (Fig. 5E). The binding of wild type and mutated E1E2 derived from pseudotyped HIV-1 particles to recombinant CD81 was not affected by the Pro to Ala substitutions (Fig. 5F). These data indicate Pro683 is critical for the ability of E1E2 to mediate viral entry at a post-CD81 binding step.Fig. 5A, heterodimerization of E1E2 proline mutations in cell lysates. Metabolically labeled lysates of 293T cells transfected with wild type (WT), mutated pE1E2H77c, or empty pcDNA4 vector (no E1E2) were immunoprecipitated with the conformation-dependent anti-E2 mAb H53.

https://openalex.org/W2076715268,"The hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 possesses chitinase (Tk-ChiA) and exo-β-d-glucosaminidase (Tk-GlmA) for chitin degradation; the former produces diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAc2) from chitin, and the latter hydrolyzes chitobiose (GlcN2) to glucosamine (GlcN). To identify the enzyme that physiologically links these two activities, here we focused on the deacetylase that provides the substrate for Tk-GlmA from GlcNAc2. The deacetylase could be detected in and partially purified from T. kodakaraensis cells, and the corresponding gene (Tk-dac) was identified on the genome. The deduced amino acid sequence was classified into the LmbE protein family including N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylases and 1-d-myo-inosityl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside deacetylase. Recombinant Tk-Dac showed deacetylase activity toward N-acetylchitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc2–5), and the deacetylation site was revealed to be specific at the nonreducing GlcNAc residue. The enzyme also deacetylated GlcNAc monomer. In T. kodakaraensis cells, the transcription of Tk-dac, Tk-glmA, Tk-chiA, and the clustered genes were induced by GlcNAc2, suggesting the function of this gene cluster in chitin catabolism in vivo. These results have revealed a unique chitin catabolic pathway in T. kodakaraensis, in which GlcNAc2 produced from chitin is degraded by the concerted action of Tk-Dac and Tk-GlmA. That is, GlcNAc2 is site-specifically deacetylated to GlcN-GlcNAc by Tk-Dac and then hydrolyzed to GlcN and GlcNAc by Tk-GlmA followed by a second deacetylation step of the remaining GlcNAc by Tk-Dac to form GlcN. This is the first elucidation of an archaeal chitin catabolic pathway and defines a novel mechanism for dimer processing using a combination of deacetylation and cleavage, distinct from any previously known pathway.

This is the first elucidation of an archaeal chitin catabolic pathway and defines a novel mechanism for dimer processing using a combination of deacetylation and cleavage, distinct from any previously known pathway. Chitin is the linear homopolymer of β-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and its biological production is the most abundant after cellulose. Degradation of chitin in eucaryotes and bacteria has been studied very well, and chitin catabolic pathways clarified from these studies are summarized in Fig. 1A (thin arrows). Chitin is degraded into diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAc2) by the combination of endo- and exo-type chitinases (reactions 1 and 2) followed by dimer processing with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GlcNAcase 1The abbreviations used are: GlcNAcase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GlcNAc2, diacetylchitobiose; GlcNAc6P, GlcNAc 6-phosphate; GlcNase, exo-β-d-glucosaminidase; Tk, T. kodakaraensis; GlcN2, chitobiose; GlcNAc-4MU, 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide; RT, reverse transcription; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylene-diamine; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GlcN, glucosamine.; reaction 3), GlcNAc2 phosphorylase (reaction 4), or GlcNAc2 phosphotransferase system (reaction 5) and 6-phospho-β-glucosaminidase (reaction 6) (1Gooday G.W.

In these pathways removal of the N-acetyl group derived from the starting chitin occurs after the degradation to monomers. This step is catalyzed by GlcNAc-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) deacetylase, which deacetylates the GlcNAc6P produced by cleavage of GlcNAc6P-GlcNAc (reaction 6) or by phosphorylation of GlcNAc. An alternative pathway for chitin degradation is proposed to be initiated by deacetylation of chitin by chitin deacetylase (reaction 7). The resulting deacetylated chitin, chitosan, is then degraded to glucosamine (GlcN) by chitosanase (endo-type enzyme; reaction 8) in cooperation with exo-β-d-glucosaminidase (GlcNase; reaction 9) (1Gooday G.W. Ratledge C. Biochemistry of Microbial Degradation. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 279-312Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to eucaryotes and bacteria, there is very little information concerning chitinolysis in archaea. We previously reported the first characterization of a thermostable chitinase from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodak-araensis KOD1 (5Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tanaka T. Fukui T. Imanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35629-35635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The chitinase (Tk-ChiA) has a unique domain structure that is composed of dual catalytic domains and triple chitin binding domains. The dual catalytic domains can individually cleave chitin chains with different profiles, namely, the N- and C-terminal catalytic domains exhibit exo- and endo-type cleavage specificities, respectively. Other archaeal chitinases from the hyperthermophiles Thermococcus chitonophagus (7Andronopoulou E. Vorgias C.E. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Pyrococcus furiosus (8Gao J. Bauer M.W. Shockley K.R. Pysz M.A. Kelly R.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have also been reported. These chitinases from hyperthermophilic archaea, including Tk-ChiA, produce GlcNAc2 as an end product from chitin. Recently, we have identified another chitinolytic enzyme, GlcNase, from T. kodakaraensis in the course of searching for enzymes involved in GlcNAc2 catabolism (9Tanaka T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This GlcNase (Tk-GlmA) hydrolyzed chitobiose (GlcN2) to GlcN and was induced by GlcNAc2, the end product from chitin by Tk-ChiA. These facts have suggested the presence of a GlcNAc2-specific deacetylase activity in T. kodakaraensis in order to supply the substrate for Tk-GlmA from GlcNAc2 (Fig. 1A, thick arrows). In this study we performed purification and characterization of a GlcNAc2 deacetylase (Tk-Dac) from T. kodakaraensis and have clarified that one gene with previously unknown function encoded this protein. Tk-Dac deacetylated the nonreducing terminal unit of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as well as GlcNAc monomers, constituting a novel archaeal chitin catabolic pathway in this organism together with Tk-ChiA and Tk-GlmA (Fig. 1B). Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—T. kodakaraensis KOD1 was grown anaerobically for 48 h at 85 °C in 1-liter screw-cap bottles with 800 ml of MA medium (4.8 and 26.4 g of Marine Art SF agents A and B, respectively (Senju Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan), 5 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of Tryptone in 1 liter of deionized water) supplemented with pyruvic acid sodium salt (5 g/liter) and chitin (1 g/liter). Escherichia coli TG-1 and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL were used as hosts for the expression plasmid derived from pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and were cultivated in LB medium at 37 °C. Partial Purification of GlcNAc2 Deacetylase from T. kodakaraensis KOD1—The culture broth of T. kodakaraensis containing chitin (11.2 liters) was filtered through Toyo filter paper No. 101 (Toyo Roshi, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain chitin-associated cells. The cells on the chitin particles were suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 mm EDTA) and then disrupted by sonication. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation (6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the 50–70% ammonium sulfate-precipitated fraction was dissolved in 45 ml of buffer A. The protein solution was applied to an anion-exchange Resource Q column (6 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing GlcNAc2 deacetylase activity were collected and concentrated using Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter unit Biomax-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The sample was then applied to a gel-filtration Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl). The collected active fractions were dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) and applied to an anion-exchange Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.5 m NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to the active fractions after the Mono Q column at a final concentration of 1.5 m, and the sample was applied onto hydrophobic Resource ISO (1 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 1.5 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1.5–0.5 m ammonium sulfate. The active fractions were combined and used for activity staining after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay system with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Activity Staining—GlcNAc2 deacetylase activity was detected in the gel after non-denaturing SDS-PAGE by using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (GlcNAc-4MU, Sigma) with recombinant exo-β-d-glucosaminidase from T. kodakaraensis (Tk-GlmA) (9Tanaka T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as a coupling enzyme. A protein sample mixed with 2× sample buffer was applied to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel without prior boiling. After the electrophoresis, the gel was rinsed three times with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 20 min followed by soaking in the reaction buffer (100 μm GlcNAc-4MU, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) at room temperature for 30 min. The gel removed from the reaction buffer was overlaid with a Tk-GlmA-containing gel (10 nm recombinant Tk-GlmA, 12.5% acrylamide, 0.33% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25% ammonium persulfate, 0.05% TEMED), and the fluorescent band was visualized on a transilluminator (312 nm) after incubation of the gel bilayer at 70 °C for 5–15 min. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the active protein was determined by a protein sequencer Model 491 cLC (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). DNA Manipulations and Sequencing—DNA manipulations were carried out by standard methods, as described by Sambrook and Russell (10Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan) or Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Small scale preparation of plasmid DNA from E. coli cells was performed with the Qiagen plasmid Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed with BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit Version 3.0 and Model 3100 capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Construction of the Expression Plasmid—The expression plasmid for Tk-dac was constructed by PCR as described below. Two oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-TCGGCCATGGTGTTTGAGGAGTTCAAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCGGATCCAGAGAGGTACAG-3′ (underlined sequences indicate an NcoI site in the sense primer and a BamHI site in the antisense primer, respectively)) and T. kodakaraensis genomic DNA were used as primers and template for DNA amplification, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and BamHI and then ligated with the corresponding sites in the plasmid pET-15b. The absence of unintended mutations in the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid was designated as pET-dac. Purification of Recombinant Tk-Dac—E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells harboring pET-dac were induced for overexpression with 0.05 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at the mid-exponential growth phase and incubated for a further 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), resuspended in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA), and then disrupted by sonication. The supernatant after centrifugation (14,000 × g for 30 min) was incubated at 80 °C for 20 min and centrifuged (14,000 × g for 15 min) to obtain a heat-stable protein solution. The solution was applied to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 70% saturation, and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in 1.3 m ammonium sulfate in buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation (28,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was applied to a hydrophobic Resource ISO column (6 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.9 m ammonium sulfate in buffer E. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.9–0.45 m ammonium sulfate, and the peak fractions eluting at 0.65 m ammonium sulfate were concentrated using Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter unit Biomax-10 (Millipore). This was applied to a gel-filtration Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with buffer B. The peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer C and applied to an anion-exchange Mono Q HR 5/5 column. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.5 m NaCl, and the peak fractions were dialyzed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and stored at 4 °C. Enzyme Assays—Deacetylase activity during purification of the native enzyme was assayed with a fluorogenic substrate, GlcNAc-4MU, under the presence of excess recombinant Tk-GlmA for coupled hydrolysis. The reaction was performed at 70 °C for 60 min in 500 μl of 10 μm GlcNAc-4MU, 10 nm Tk-GlmA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction was terminated by cooling the sample in an ice-cold bath. To determine the optimal pH for recombinant Tk-Dac, the reaction was performed for 10 min at 70 °C in 250 μl of 10 μm GlcNAc-4MU, 4 nm recombinant Tk-Dac, and 50 mm appropriate buffer (citrate-NaOH, HEPES-NaOH, or CHES-NaOH). After cooling the sample to stop the reaction, the protein was removed from the reaction mixture with a centrifugal filter devise (Microcon YM-10). Removal of the Tk-Dac protein was confirmed by the absence of detectable deacetylation activity in the filtrate. 100 μl of the filtrate was then added into 400 μl of 12.5 nm Tk-GlmA and 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0). This mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. This reaction time (10 min) was confirmed to be sufficient to complete the second reaction under the presence of excess Tk-GlmA. In the case of determining optimal temperature, the first reaction was performed in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.5) at various temperatures (37–100 °C). To quantify the liberated 4-methylumbelliferon, the cooled sample (500 μl) was mixed with 500 μl of 100 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 11), and the fluorescence (350 nm, excitation; 440 nm, emission) was measured with a spectrofluorometer (model F-2000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Kinetic properties of recombinant Tk-Dac toward N-acetylchitooligosaccharides were determined as below. The reactions were performed with various concentrations of GlcNAc1–3 (GlcNAc, 5–160 mm; GlcNAc2, 2.5–80 mm; GlcNAc3, 1.25–40 mm) in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.5) at 75 °C for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 0.5 m HCl at 4 °C, and then Tk-Dac was removed with Microcon YM-10. The amount of acetic acid in the filtrate was enzymatically determined by using an acetic acid determination kit (Roche Diagnostics). Bulk GlcNAc2 and GlcNAc3 were kindly donated from Yaizu Suisankagaku Industry (Shizuoka, Japan). Acetic acid slightly contaminated in these substrates had been removed before use by an anion-exchange spin column (Vivapure Q Mini H; Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). Analyses of Reaction Products—The analyses of reaction products from GlcNAc1–5, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylmannosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, and GlcNAc6P were performed with silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC) as described previously (5Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that we used an LHP-KF HPTLC plate (Whatman, Kent, UK) in this study. For detection of the products, aniline diphenylamine reagent and ninhydrin reagent were used. Western Blot Analysis—T. kodakaraensis was cultivated in 10 ml of MA medium supplemented with 20 μl of polysulfide solution (20% elemental sulfur in 3 m Na2S) and various kinds of saccharides. The preparation of colloidal chitin has been described previously (5Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, disrupted by sonication in buffer C containing protein inhibitor mix (Complete mini; Roche Diagnostics), and then centrifuged (15,000 × g for 30 min) to obtain soluble fractions. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and successive Western blot analysis using specific antiserum (rabbit) against the recombinant Tk-Dac. A protein A-peroxidase conjugate was used to visualize the specific protein together with 4-chloro-1-naphthol and hydrogen peroxide. Northern Blot Analysis and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Cultivation of T. kodakaraensis with GlcNAc2 or colloidal chitin was performed as described above. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Midi kit and the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was separated by denaturing agarose electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting. Digoxigenin labeling of a DNA fragment, hybridization, and detection were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit I; Roche Diagnostics). A HindIII-NdeI fragment (747 bp) of the Tk-dac-coding region was used as a template for probe preparation. For RT reactions, 250 ng of total RNA was used with Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics), and subsequent PCR was performed with KOD polymerase (for Tk-dac, Tk-glmA, Tk-gly, and Tk-chiA) or KOD dash polymerase (for Tk-sbp) (Toyobo). Sequences of the primer pairs were: F1, 5′-TCGGCCATGGTGTTTGAGGAGTTCAAC-3′, and R1, 5′-GGGCTCCCAAAGCTCCCAC-3′ for Tk-dac; F2, 5′-GTCGCCTGGAGGCACTTCTTC-3′, and R2, 5′-GGGAGTATTGCTCATGGCC-3′ for Tk-glmA; F3, 5′-CGGCCTCTTCGAGGCTGG-3′, and R3, 5′-GTAGAGCTGGACGATGTAC-3′ for Tk-sbp; F4, 5′-CAGAATCTTTCCGTGTCC-3′, and R4, 5′-TCCGTTGCCTTAACGTCC-3′ for Tk-gly; F5, 5′-CGAGACTGCCATAGAGATCC-3′, and R5, 5′-GCAGATCTCAGCCGAGGTGCTGGAGAACAGTATC-3′ for Tk-chiA. Primer pairs were designed to amplify a ∼600 bp fragment of each gene. Immunoprecipitation—Protein A-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the affinity resin for immunoprecipitation experiments. Five hundred microliters of rabbit antiserum (anti-Tk-Dac serum, anti-Tk-GlmA serum (9Tanaka T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or serum before immunization) was mixed with 100 μl of the resin suspension at 4 °C for 12 h. Antibody-bound resin was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed 5 times with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (136.9 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4·12 H2O, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4) followed by the addition of 100 μl of the cell extract (2 mg of protein/ml) of T. kodakaraensis grown in the MA medium containing 0.1% GlcNAc2. After incubation at 4 °C for 1.5 h, the supernatant was subjected to determine the GlcNAcase, GlcNase, and deacetylase activities. Identification of the Protein Exhibiting GlcNAc2 Deacetylase Activity and the Corresponding Gene in T. kodakaraensis KOD1—As described above we have previously demonstrated that T. kodakaraensis possesses a chitinase (Tk-ChiA) for degradation of chitin polymer to GlcNAc2 along with a novel exo- β-d-glucosaminidase (Tk-GlmA) to cleave the deacetylated product of GlcNAc2 (5Tanaka T. Fujiwara S. Nishikori S. Fukui T. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5338-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tanaka T. Fukui T. Imanaka T. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggested the existence of an enzyme responsible for the deacetylation of GlcNAc2 in this organism. Therefore, the deacetylase activity in T. kodakaraensis was examined by using a fluorogenic Glc-NAc-4MU and recombinant Tk-GlmA as a substrate and a coupling enzyme, respectively. It has been already clarified that Tk-GlmA cannot cleave this substrate due to the N-acetyl group on the sugar moiety nor can it deacetylate this substrate (9Tanaka T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5175-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cell extract of T. kodakaraensis showed only weak cleavage activity (apparent GlcNAcase activity) in the absence of the recombinant Tk-GlmA (4.16 pmol/min/mg). In contrast, the addition of the coupled enzyme enhanced the cleavage activity up to 5.5-fold (23.1 pmol/min/mg), indicating a significant deacetylase activity in the extract. We then performed purification of the protein exhibiting this deacetylase activity from T. kodakaraensis cells. The cells cultivated in chitin-containing medium were disrupted by sonication, and the active protein was partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although many protein bands were still observed in non-denaturing SDS-PAGE after the final chromatography (Fig. 2A, lane 2), a protein with GlcNAc2 deacetylase activity in the gel could be identified by activity staining using GlcNAc-4MU and recombinant Tk-GlmA (Fig. 2A, lane 1, black arrowhead). In the negative control experiment without the coupling enzyme, the deacetylase-active band was not detected (data not shown). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the identified protein was determined to be VFEEFNNFDEAF. Using the preliminary complete genome sequence of T. kodakaraensis KOD1, we searched for this amino acid sequence and identified one open reading frame that encoded a protein with the N-terminal sequence of MVFEEFNNFDEAFSALL (identical amino acids are underlined). Interestingly, this gene was located adjacently upstream of the Tk-chiA gene in the opposite orientation and also relatively near (∼9 kilobase pairs upstream) Tk-glmA (Fig. 3). This gene was designated as Tk-dac. Primary structure of Tk-dac—The Tk-dac gene consisted of 804 bp, encoding a protein of 268 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 30,300 Da. There was neither an N-terminal signal sequence nor transmembrane helices in the deduced amino acid sequence, which was consistent with the fact that Tk-Dac was detected in and partially purified from the cytosolic fraction of T. kodakaraensis cells as an intracellular enzyme. Clear-cut homologs against the translated product were only seen in the closely related Pyrococcus spp., Pyrococcus abyssi (PAB1341), P. furiosus (PF0354), and Pyrococcus horikoshii (PH0499) (60–61% identities), annotated as hypothetical proteins with unknown function. In addition, distantly related but homologous proteins (25–35% identities) are widely distributed in archaea and bacteria. Against the Pfam and COGs databases (11Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar), Tk-Dac is classified into the uncharacterized LmbE-like protein family (Pfam02585 as well as COG2120), where LmbE was originally assigned to a hypothetical protein coded in a gene cluster for lincomycin biosynthesis of Streptomyces lincolnensis. This family includes N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylases from mammals (13Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol.

Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6958-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis and mycothiol biosynthesis, respectively. Although Tk-Dac shared only weak and partial similarities with these enzymes, an important common feature is the function as a deacetylase toward the N-acetylglucosamine moiety. Recently, the crystal structure of a protein with unknown function in the LmbE-like protein family (TT1542) has been determined in the course of structural genomics of Thermus thermophilus (17Handa N. Terada T. Kamewari Y. Hamana H. Tame J.R.H. Park S.Y. Kinoshita K. Ota M. Nakamura H. Kuramitsu S. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional structure, highly conserved residues in this family were clustered in one region with their side chains composing the surface of a hydrophilic cavity. This region was suggested to be a putative active site, and a computational analysis predicted the catalytic importance of seven residues in the cluster. Although the identity between Tk-Dac and TT1542 was 30% within 223 amino acids, 6 of the 7 important residues were also conserved in Tk-Dac (His-40, Asp-42, Asp-43, Arg-88, Glu-91, and Asp-111). Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant Tk-Dac—To characterize Tk-Dac in detail, the recombinant protein was produced in E. coli cells with the pET expression system. The recombinant protein was purified to apparent homogeneity on SDS-PAGE by heat treatment and column chromatography, as shown in Fig. 2B, lane 1. The result of its N-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to the deduced amino acid sequence (MVFEEFNNFDEA, identical amino acids are under-lined). The mobility of the purified protein in the non-denaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, lane 2, upper band) corresponded to that of the protein with GlcNAc2 deacetylase activity from T. kodakaraensis in Fig. 2A. The molecular mass of the recombinant Tk-Dac was estimated to be about 30 kDa by denaturing SDS-PAGE and 160 kDa by gel filtration chromatography (figure not shown), and the latter was comparable with that of the active protein from T. kodakaraensis. The results indicated that Tk-Dac was likely to be a homohexameric enzyme. Enzymatic Properties of Tk-Dac—The optimal pH and temperature of Tk-Dac for GlcNAc-4MU were 8.5 and 75 °C, respectively. Activity levels at 37 °C and 100 °C were ∼20% of that observed at the optimal temperature. To examine the mode of action of this enzyme, various chain lengths of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides (GlcNAc1–5) were used as substrates, and the reaction products were analyzed by TLC with two detection procedures. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Tk-Dac could efficiently deacetylate GlcNAc to GlcN. When GlcNAc2–5 were used as substrates, detection of the products with ninhydrin reagent (for amino sugars) (Fig. 4A) clearly indicated formation of deacetylated products from all the substrates examined. However, the mobilities of each reaction product di"

The mouse GFAT2 cDNA was cloned, and the protein was expressed with either an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase or His tag. The purified protein expressed in mammalian cells had GFAT activity. The Km values for the two substrates of reaction, fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine, were determined to be 0.8 mm for fructose 6-phosphate and 1.2 mm for glutamine, which are within the ranges determined for GFAT1. The protein sequence around the serine 202 of GFAT2 was conserved to the serine 205 of GFAT1, whereas the serine at 235 in GFAT1 was not present in GFAT2. Previously we showed that phosphorylation of serine 205 in GFAT1 by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibits its activity. Like GFAT1, GFAT2 was phosphorylated by PKA, but GFAT2 activity increased approximately 2.2-fold by this modification. When serine 202 of GFAT2 was mutated to an alanine, the enzyme not only became resistant to phosphorylation, but also the increase in activity in response to PKA also was blocked. These results indicated that the phosphorylation of serine 202 was necessary and sufficient for these alterations by PKA. GFAT2 was modestly inhibited (15%) by UDP-GlcNAc but not through detectable O-glycosylation. GFAT2 is, therefore, an isoenzyme of GFAT1, but its regulation by cAMP is the opposite, allowing differential regulation of the hexosamine pathway in specialized tissues.

GFAT2 is, therefore, an isoenzyme of GFAT1, but its regulation by cAMP is the opposite, allowing differential regulation of the hexosamine pathway in specialized tissues. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, a universally conserved pathway in all life forms, metabolizes fructose 6-phosphate in conjunction with glutamine and acetate to UDP-N-acetylhexosamine as its main end product. These UDP-N-acetylhexosamines are used mainly for the synthesis of exported proteins that are modified by complex carbohydrate side chains prior to their exit from the interior of the cell. In addition, UDP-N-acetylhexosamines also serve as essential substrates for the synthesis of the glycosyl side chain of glycolipids, and the ratio of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine usually is 3:1 (1Marshall S.

UDP-GlcNAc is an active precursor of chitin that is polymerized by bacterial, fungal, and insect cells to form the major component of the wall and insect cuticle. In higher eukaryotes, part of the UDP-GlcNAc is used by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) 1The abbreviations used are: OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFAT, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; mGFAT, mouse GFAT; hGFAT, human GFAT.1The abbreviations used are: OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFAT, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; mGFAT, mouse GFAT; hGFAT, human GFAT. to modify nucleocytoplasmic proteins by the addition of the monosaccharide GlcNAc to the hydroxyl groups on serine or threonine residues of proteins. This O-GlcNAc modification can be removed from proteins by the enzyme O-GlcNAcase. Important observations have been linked to this modification of proteins by OGT. Overexpression of OGT causes insulin resistance in adipocytes (3Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chin Jr., E. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 194: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the modification has been found in 80 or more proteins, many of which are transcription factors, only recently has there been concrete evidence for a direct role of the O-GlcNAc modification in the control of protein functions (8Wells L. Hart G.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The enzyme OGT has been localized to gene-targeted co-repression complexes (9Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and the modification of the transcription factor Sp1 has been shown to repress the transcriptional activation capacity of OGT (10Yang X. Su K. Roos M.D. Chang Q. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6611-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is also regulated reversibly by this modification: OGT inhibits the function of proteasomes, whereas O-GlcNAcase activates the organelle (11Zhang F. Su K. Yang X. Bowe D.B. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Because the proteasome controls the abundance of many regulatory proteins, including proapoptotic and developmental factors, and gene co-repression similarly determines cellular outcome, the hexosamine pathway, with its ability to sample the metabolism of sugars (glucose backbone of GlcNAc), amino acids (nitrogen in GlcNAc), and lipids (acetate in GlcNAc), could provide a metabolic input into vital cell processes. Indeed, an absence of the OGT gene on the X chromosome is lethal (12Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in glucosamine synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). The flux of glucose into the hexosamine pathway can therefore be controlled by the activity of the GFAT enzyme. GFAT activity has been detected in almost every organism and tissue. The enzyme is composed of two domains: a glutaminase domain, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, and a synthase domain, which catalyzes amination and isomerization of fructose 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate (13Massiere F. Badet-Denisot M.A. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli GFAT has been crystallized, and the structure of the enzyme has been elucidated (14Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because the activity of GFAT controls the entry of glucose into the hexosamine pathway, the control of GFAT activity might have implications for these and other regulatory processes. Previously, our laboratory expressed and purified recombinant GST-GFAT in a mammalian expression system and showed that the phosphorylation of serine 205 of the GFAT protein by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibited the activity of the enzyme. Such inhibition of GFAT would cause the preferential metabolism of glucose to ATP rather than glucosamine in pancreatic β cells, perhaps causing more ATP-stimulated insulin secretion (15Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement 4th, J.P. Boyd 3rd, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) for a given glucose challenge. Because incretins such as Glp1, which are made in the gastrointestinal tract in response to food, increase cAMP in the β cell (16Jhala U.S. Canettieri G. Screaton R.A. Kulkarni R.N. Krajewski S. Reed J. Walker J. Lin X. White M. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), part of their mechanism of action might result from this shift in the metabolism of glucose. When GFAT was purified from liver and subjected to phosphorylation by PKA, however, another investigative group (17Zhou J. Huynh Q.K. Hoffman R.T. Crook E.D. Daniels M.C. Gulve E.A. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) found that the enzyme activity was increased by approximately 1.7-fold. At approximately the same time of that study, a gene encoding a protein with approximately 75% homology to GFAT was cloned. The gene product was named GFAT2 on the basis of this homology but not on the basis of activity. Northern blot analysis revealed different tissue distribution between GFAT1 and GFAT2. GFAT1 was more highly expressed in the pancreas, placenta, and testis than GFAT2, whereas GFAT2 was expressed throughout the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord. The GFAT2 locus was mapped to human chromosome 5q and mouse chromosome 11 (18Oki T. Yamazaki K. Kuromitsu J. Okada M. Tanaka I. Genomics. 1999; 57: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether GFAT2 indeed has GFAT enzyme activity and the effect of PKA phosphorylation on the enzyme activity, GFAT2 was cloned, expressed, and purified. Our studies showed that GFAT2 has GFAT enzyme activity. It is phosphorylated at a site similar to GFAT1, but instead of inhibiting its activity on phosphorylation, the modification accentuated the enzyme activity. These isozymes of GFAT would allow different tissues under hormonal stimulation to metabolize glucose differently. Materials—Protein kinase A catalytic subunit, protein phosphatase catalytic subunit, fructose 6-phosphate, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, l-glutamine, glutamic acid, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, mycophenolic acid, thrombin, protein kinase A inhibitor, protease inhibitors mixture, monoclonal anti-GST tag antibody, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-His6 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Glutamate dehydrogenase and ATP were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—BSC40 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 7.5% CO2. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Mouse GST-GFAT2—The 5′ end 769 base pairs of the mouse GFAT2 cDNA (accession number NM_013529) were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides with the sequence 5′-CATCGGTACCGAATTCTGCGGAATCTTTGCCTAC-3′ and 5′-TTCTATGATGGCACTTGC-3′. The product was inserted into the EcoRI site of pBS and sequenced. The 1280 base pairs of 3′ end of mouse GFAT2 were amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGCTGTGGGCGATAAAGC-3′ and 5′-CGAGGCCTCGAGTCATTCCACAGTGACAGAC-3′. This portion of mGFAT2 was inserted between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pTMGST and then sequenced. The 5′ end of mGFAT2 was then inserted into the EcoRI site upstream of the remainder in the correct direction to create the intact sequence in pTMGST. This construct was used to express the N-terminal GST-tagged mGFAT. The full-length GFAT2 was also cloned into pCDNA3.0HisC (Invitrogen) between EcoRI and XhoI, and then the fusion fragment encoding the His tag and mGFAT2 sequence was cloned into pTM3 between the NcoI and XhoI sites. This construct was used to express the N-terminal His-tagged mGFAT2 fusion protein. Mutagenesis Study of mGFAT2—The potential PKA phosphorylation site (serine 202) was mutated to alanine by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGAGGAGAGGCGCCCCCTTGCTCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGAGCAAGGGGGCGCCTCTCCTCG-3′. The mutated segment was cloned into mGFAT2 and sequenced to confirm placement of the mutation. Vaccinia Virus Expression and Purification of Recombinant Fusion Proteins—Procedures for the generation of recombinant GST-mGFAT2 vaccinia virus were as described using both mycophenolic acid and bromodeoxyuridine selections (19Moss B. Science. 1991; 252: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 20Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The vaccinia virus system was a kind gift from Dr. B. Moss (19Moss B. Science. 1991; 252: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To express GST-mGFAT2, the BSC40 cells were infected with recombinant GST-mGFAT2 virus and VTF7-3 virus, which expresses T7 polymerase in infected mammalian cells; T7 polymerase can bind to the promoter of GST-mGFAT2, resulting in the overexpression of GST-mGFAT2 proteins. After 24 h of infection, the cells were collected and lysed in the extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 5mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm fructose 6-phosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture. After standing on ice for 20–30 min, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation, and the GST-mGFAT2 was purified by incubation with a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30–60 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with the extraction buffer. The fusion protein bound to the glutathione beads was eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione. To express the His-tagged mGFAT2, the plasmid pTM3His-mGFAT2 was transfected into BSC40 cells by electroporation at 250 V and 500 microfarads. After overnight recovery, the cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus VTF7-3. After incubating for 24 h, the cells were lysed in the extraction buffer (without EDTA). The N-terminal His-tagged mGFAT2 was purified with His-tagged beads as directed by the manufacturer (Novagen). Enzyme Assay of mGFAT2—The enzyme activity was determined by a spectrophotometric method (21Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10148-10154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chang Q. Su K. Baker J.R. Yang X. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21981-21987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in a 1-ml standard assay as described previously. The protein concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE. A blank calibration control consisted of the entire reaction mixture with the same volume of GST- or His-tagged bead elution buffer. Phosphorylation of mGFAT2—The purified GST-mGFAT2 and His-mGFAT2 fusion proteins (0.1 μg) were phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of PKA in phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 20 min. After the phosphorylation reaction, the GFAT activity was measured. Fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine were added to final concentrations of 10 mm and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 2 min. After the temperature was lowered by sitting the reaction mixture on ice for 3 min, the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Glutamate dehydrogenase (20 units) and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide at a final concentration of 0.5 mm were added in an enzyme activity assay buffer to a final volume of 1 ml. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the A365 was determined. [γ-32P]ATP Labeling of mGFAT2—The GST-mGFAT2 or mutant GST-mGFAT2 (0.5 μg) was incubated with or without 100 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA in the phosphorylation buffer described above. Unlabeled ATP at a final concentration of 0.1 mm and 1 μlof[γ32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) were added to the reaction. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the GST beads were added into the reaction mixture and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with gentle shaking, and then the beads were spun down and washed three times with phosphorylation buffer. The sample with beads was then boiled, and the protein was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of the dried gel. O-GlcNAc Modification of mGFAT2—Prior to the O-GlcNAc modification assay, the purified GST-mGFAT2 still bound to glutathione beads was treated with protein phosphatase catalytic subunit at 30 °C for 20 min in the phosphatase reaction buffer (25 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl). After the reaction, the beads were spun down and washed, and the GST-mGFAT2 protein was eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione. With UDP-GlcNAc at a final concentration of 5 μm, the eluted GST-mGFAT2 was mixed with the purified GST-OGT, which was expressed in BSC40 cells using the same recombinant vaccinia virus expression system as mGFAT2 (11Zhang F. Su K. Yang X. Bowe D.B. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The activity of the purified GST-OGT was confirmed as described (10Yang X. Su K. Roos M.D. Chang Q. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6611-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto an 8% SDS polyacrylamide gel. The O-GlcNAc-acylated proteins were detected with RL2 antibody (23Snow C.M. Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 24Han I. Oh E.S. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by Western blot, and the same blot was stripped and reblotted by anti-GST tag antibody to detect the GST-tagged proteins. Expression of GST-mGFAT2 and His-mGFAT2 in BSC40 Cells—The GST-mGFAT2 was expressed in BSC40 cells coinfected with VTF7-3 virus and the recombinant vaccinia virus that encodes GST-mGFAT2. The control cell lysate from the cells infected only with VTF7-3 virus showed many bands (Fig. 1A, lane 2). When the cells were infected with VTF7-3 virus and the GST-mGFAT2 recombinant virus, a new band appeared at approximately 110 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Western blot analysis of the lysates with an anti-GST tag antibody showed that the 110-kDa band of the cell lysate programmed for expression of the recombinant GST-mGFAT2 was a GST-reactive band (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The fusion protein was purified on glutathione beads. The eluted GST-mGFAT2, seen by Coomassie Blue staining after purification on GST beads (Fig. 1C, lane 1), was used in the enzyme activity and phosphorylation assays. Similar purification and elution steps were performed on the control lysate, yielding a few bands of lower intensity background (Fig. 1C, lane 2). The cells were also programmed to express His-mGFAT2, in which the six histidines were substituted for the GST on the N terminus of mGFAT2. Compared with the control lysate, which was from cells that were transfected with vector pTM3 and infected with VTF7-3 virus (Fig. 1D, lane 2), the lysate of the cells transfected with pTM3His-mGFAT2 contained a new band, which was visible on analysis by Western blot, with anti-His-tag antibody. The band was at 81 kDa (Fig. 1D, lane 1) as predicted from the size of the His-mGFAT2 cDNA. The nickel affinity-purified protein at the same molecular weight was barely visible on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel (data not shown). Kinetics of mGFAT2 Enzymatic Activity—A spectrophotometric assay was used to determine whether the purified GST-mGFAT2 fusion protein showed GFAT activity. The concentration of both substrates, fructose 6-phosphate (Fig. 2A) and glutamine (Fig. 2B), was varied while the other substrate was kept at 10 mm (saturation concentration) and the initial rates of the reactions were determined. When the reciprocal of the rate of the reaction was plotted against the reciprocal of the substrate concentration (Fig. 2, lower panels), a linear plot was obtained (Lineweaver-Burke plot). From these linearized results, the Km values were obtained for both substrates. The result showed that the purified recombinant GST-mGFAT2 did have GFAT activity like GFAT1. The Km of GST-mGFAT2 for fructose 6-phosphate was 0.8 mm, and Km for glutamine was 1.2 mm (Fig. 2). Previous studies have measured the kinetic characteristics of GFAT1 by different assay methods and showed the Km values range between 0.2 and 1.56 mm for fructose 6-phosphate and 0.4 and 3.8 mm for glutamine (25Milewski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1597: 173-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Broschat K.O. Gorka C. Page J.D. Martin-Berger C.L. Davies M.S. Huang Hc H.C. Gulve E.A. Salsgiver W.J. Kasten T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Km values of GST-mGFAT2 for both of its two substrates measured in this study fall within these ranges. PKA Treatment Induces an Increase of mGFAT2 Activity in Vitro—From the previous studies on hGFAT1 (human GFAT1), we found that phosphorylation of recombinant protein GST-hGFAT1 by PKA at its serine 205 blocks the enzyme activity, and serine 235, the other potential phosphorylation site of hGFAT1, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the inhibition (22Chang Q. Su K. Baker J.R. Yang X. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21981-21987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Alignment of different GFATs shows this serine is very conserved from E. coli to human (Fig. 3A) and that the RRGS is a potential recognition site of PKA. The counterpart of serine 235 of GFAT1 is not present in GFAT2 (Fig. 3A). No other potential PKA phosphorylation sites were present in either protein. The presence of only a single site in GFAT2 made analysis simpler than for GFAT1. As for GFAT1, recombinant purified mGFAT2 fusion protein was tested to determine whether it can be phosphorylated and its activity regulated by PKA. Indeed, our results showed that GST-GFAT2 can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 3D), but unlike recombinant GST-GFAT1 that is inhibited by this phosphorylation, both purified fusion proteins GST-mGFAT2 and His-mGFAT2 were stimulated approximately 2.2-fold by this modification (Fig. 3, B and C). When a PKA inhibitor was added into the reaction with the catalytic subunit of PKA, the activation of mGFAT2 by PKA was substantially reduced (Fig. 3C). According to the homology around the single PKA phosphorylation site of mGFAT2, its serine 202 was replaced by an alanine. Not only did this mutation abrogate the ability of mGFAT2 to be phosphorylated (Fig. 3D), it also prevented the change in activity that was observed for the wild type enzyme (Fig. 3B), regardless of whether the N-terminal tag was GST or His. Thus, the two isoforms of GFAT can be phosphorylated by PKA at a comparable site; yet the enzymatic activity of one is inhibited, whereas the other is simulated. UDP-GlcNAc Partially Inhibits the Activity of Recombinant mGFAT2—It has been reported that GFAT1 can be feedback-inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc, the final product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (26Broschat K.O. Gorka C. Page J.D. Martin-Berger C.L. Davies M.S. Huang Hc H.C. Gulve E.A. Salsgiver W.J. Kasten T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27McKnight G.L. Mudri S.L. Mathewes S.L. Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25208-25212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GFAT2 was also found to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by UDP-GlcNAc, but the maximal inhibition of its activity was only 15% (Fig. 4). The inhibition appears specific to the sugar because neither UDP-galactose nor GlcNAc without a UDP moiety was able to inhibit the enzyme activity. GFAT1 appears to be more influenced by UDP-GlcNAc because its inhibition was observed to be greater at 51% (27McKnight G.L. Mudri S.L. Mathewes S.L. Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25208-25212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 80% (26Broschat K.O. Gorka C. Page J.D. Martin-Berger C.L. Davies M.S. Huang Hc H.C. Gulve E.A. Salsgiver W.J. Kasten T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), respectively. mGFAT2 Is Probably Not O-GlcNAc-modified—One mechanism by which GFAT activity might be feedback-inhibited through increasing quantities of UDP-GlcNAc is by modification with O-GlcNAc. This post-translational modification is known to alter the activity of other proteins, such as Sp1, and it has been shown that OGT activity is substrate concentration-dependent. To test this idea, we attempted to modify GST-mGFAT2 with recombinant GST-OGT. Before treating GST-mGFAT2 with GST-OGT, the fusion protein, although bound to glutathione beads, was pretreated with a general phosphatase to preclude possible blockage of O-GlcNAc modification by a potential phosphorylation at the same site; however, no modification of GST-mGFAT2 could be detected with RL2 antibody either before or after exposure to OGT (Fig. 5). Furthermore, OGT exposure did not change GST-mGFAT2 activity (data not shown). Although it remains possible that mGFAT2 is modified by O-GlcNAc and that this modification is hidden from detection by the RL2 antibody, it is more likely that it is not modified by OGT. Thus, product inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc of mGFAT2 may be allosteric. The GFAT2 cDNA was cloned and designated as GFAT solely on the basis of sequence homology to GFAT1 (18Oki T. Yamazaki K. Kuromitsu J. Okada M. Tanaka I. Genomics. 1999; 57: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that GFAT2 has GFAT activity. Thus, there are now two enzymes that can sample some of the glucose presented into the cell and divert it through the hexosamine pathway (27McKnight G.L. Mudri S.L. Mathewes S.L. Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25208-25212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the tissue distribution of the two GFAT proteins differs, the enzymes may provide for the specific needs of the tissue. For example, we showed previously that GFAT1 is inhibited by phosphorylation by PKA. Antisense reduction of GFAT1 in the β cells of transgenic mice makes these cells resistant to streptozotocin apoptosis (5Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and so does the incretin Glp-1 (28Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5145-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 29Li Y. Hansotia T. Yusta B. Ris F. Halban P.A. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 471-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), of which the signal to the β cell is transduced by cAMP. The isolated islets from these transgenic mice also secrete more insulin under glucose stimulation than do the islets of their littermates (7Liu K. Paterson A.J. Konrad R.J. Parlow A.F. Jimi S. Roh M. Chin Jr., E. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 194: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), again mimicking the effect of the incretins on insulin secretion. Conversely, an increase in the O-GlcNAc content of β cells inhibits insulin secretion (7Liu K. Paterson A.J. Konrad R.J. Parlow A.F. Jimi S. Roh M. Chin Jr., E. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 194: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, in β cells, the natural down-regulation of GFAT1 activity by cAMP or the unnatural down-regulation of the enzyme by an antisense strategy both provide less substrate for O-GlcNAc transferase via the hexosamine pathway and may play some role in insulin secretion. The GFAT2 homology to GFAT1 extends to a homologous PKA phosphorylation site in GFAT2. The putative serine 202 site in GFAT2 is near the serine 205 site observed in GFAT1. Because of our elucidation of the role of cAMP in GFAT1 activity, we investigated this potential phosphorylation site and found that GFAT2 is also modified by PKA, but instead of inhibiting enzymatic activity of GFAT2, phosphorylation by this kinase stimulated its activity. Mutagenesis of the putative phosphorylation site not only abrogated the modification but also blocked the ability of PKA to stimulate the enzymatic activity of GFAT2. This ∼2-fold stimulation effect of PKA was independent of the epitope tag on the N terminus because both GST-GFAT2 and His-GFAT2 behaved identically. Therefore, the potential dimerization that might occur with the GST tag and does not occur with the His tag rules out tag-induced dimerization as a cause of this effect on GFAT2. Interestingly, when GFAT1 was His-tagged, PKA still inhibited the enzymatic activity (data not shown) (22Chang Q. Su K. Baker J.R. Yang X. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21981-21987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), also ruling out the potential role of the N-terminal tag in this isozyme. Because the tissue distribution of GFAT2 differs from that of GFAT1 (18Oki T. Yamazaki K. Kuromitsu J. Okada M. Tanaka I. Genomics. 1999; 57: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we believe this stimulation of activity by PKA could subserve a different function in these tissues of the hexosamine pathway under cAMP stimulation. Although the GFAT enzymes used in these experiments were recombinant and tagged, studies of the enzyme purified from rat liver (17Zhou J. Huynh Q.K. Hoffman R.T. Crook E.D. Daniels M.C. Gulve E.A. McClain D.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Candida albicans (30Milewski S. Kuszczak D. Jedrzejczak R. Smith R.J. Brown A.J. Gooday G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4000-4008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and Drosophila (31Graack H.R. Cinque U. Kress H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all show stimulation of GFAT activity by PKA. Because the two mammalian GFATs are homologous and similar in size, it remains possible that GFAT2 was purified, thereby accounting for the stimulation by PKA that was identical to that which we observed for GFAT2. Interestingly, the same interchange of GFATs may have occurred in Drosophila, which also appears to have two isozymes. The only recombinant GFAT tested was highly expressed in the chitin-synthesizing organs, and it is stimulated by PKA. A careful examination shows that the tested GFAT is more similar to GFAT2 than GFAT1, despite the title of the report (31Graack H.R. Cinque U. Kress H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the other Drosophila GFAT would be helpful. The GFAT in fungus, which synthesizes chitin, unlike that in mammals, is also stimulated by PKA. The evolution of an isozyme that is inhibited by PKA must have come approximately in multicellular organisms in which the diversification of the tissues requires differential regulation of the hexosamine pathway by cAMP. Studies on how homologous enzymes containing homologous phosphorylation sites can have opposite regulation could provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of GFAT. Although the GFAT proteins differed with respect to the effects of PKA phosphorylation, they were much more similar with respect to product inhibition. Both enzymes were inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc, although the inhibition was partial and appeared greater for GFAT1 (27McKnight G.L. Mudri S.L. Mathewes S.L. Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25208-25212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) than for GFAT2. Modification of GFAT2 by O-GlcNAc was not detected with the RL-2 antibody, suggesting that the inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc resulted from an allosteric change in GFAT2. This product inhibition and the inhibition of GFAT1 but not GFAT2 by cAMP provide strong caveats for the use of GFAT1 in transgenic animals. For example, overexpression of GFAT1 in the β cells of transgenic mice may result in increased flux through the hexosamine pathway of isolated β cells. When these cells are in vivo, however, where modulation of cAMP by incretins like Glp-1 might occur, GFAT1 might be inhibited during meals at a time when both incretins and product inhibition turn off the presumptive conversion of glucose to glucosamine. The finding of a GFAT isoform that is oppositely regulated by cAMP and more modestly regulated by its product, UDP-GlcNAc, will provide the opportunity to create transgenes that much more effectively alter the hexosamine flux in these and other cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040648248,"Cryptosporidium parvum invades target epithelia via a mechanism that involves host cell actin reorganization. We previously demonstrated that C. parvum activates the Cdc42/neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein network in host cells resulting in actin remodeling at the host cell-parasite interface, thus facilitating C. parvum cellular invasion. Here, we tested the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and frabin, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Cdc42 in the activation of Cdc42 during C. parvum infection of biliary epithelial cells. We found that C. parvum infection of cultured human biliary epithelial cells induced the accumulation of PI3K at the host cell-parasite interface and resulted in the activation of PI3K in infected cells. Frabin also was recruited to the host cell-parasite interface, a process inhibited by two PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002. The cellular expression of either a dominant negative mutant of PI3K (PI3K-Δp85) or functionally deficient mutants of frabin inhibited C. parvum-induced Cdc42 accumulation at the host cell-parasite interface. Moreover, LY294002 abolished C. parvum-induced Cdc42 activation in infected cells. Inhibition of PI3K by cellular overexpression of PI3K-Δp85 or by wortmannin or LY294002, as well as inhibition of frabin by various functionally deficient mutants, decreased C. parvum-induced actin accumulation and inhibited C. parvum cellular invasion. In contrast, the overexpression of the p85 subunit of PI3K promoted C. parvum invasion. Our data suggest that an important component of the complex process of C. parvum invasion of target epithelia results from the ability of the organism to trigger host cell PI3K/frabin signaling to activate the Cdc42 pathway, resulting in host cell actin remodeling at the host cell-parasite interface.

Cryptosporidium parvum, an intracellular parasite within the protist phylum Apicomplexa, is one of the most commonly reported enteric pathogens worldwide in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals (1O'Donoghue P.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1995; 25: 139-195Google Scholar). Humans are infected by ingesting C. parvum oocysts. Once ingested, oocysts excyst in the gastrointestinal tract releasing infective sporozoites. Mediated by uncharacterized but specific ligands on the sporozoite surface and unidentified receptors on the host cell, the sporozoite attaches to the apical membrane of the host epithelial cell, inducing host cell actin cytoskeleton remodeling and protrusion of the host cell membrane around the sporozoite to form a parasitophorous vacuole. At the base of each vacuole, the parasite establishes a unique “electron-dense band” of unknown composition, which separates the organism from the host cell cytoplasm. Thus, the parasitophorous vacuole and the dense-band keep the internalized parasite intracellular but extracytoplasmic (2Tzipori S. Griffiths J.K. Adv. Parasitol. 1998; 40: 5-36Google Scholar, 3Chen X.M. Keithly J.S. Paya C.V. LaRusso N.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1723-1731Google Scholar, 4Clark D.P. Clin. Microbiol.

These microbes utilize host cell actin for multiple reasons including cell attachment and entry, movement within and between cells, vacuole formation and remodeling, and avoidance of phagocytosis (6Gruenheid S.

Coleman D.J. Lane M.A. May R.C. Machesky L.M. Clark D.P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5940-5942Google Scholar). More recent studies have revealed that several intracellular signaling pathways are involved in C. parvum-induced actin remodeling. Whereas the accumulation of cortactin at the C. parvum host cell-parasite interface appears to be dependent upon the activation of the c-Src signaling pathway (12Chen X.M. Huang B.Q. Splinter P.L. Cao H. Zhu G. McNiven M.A. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 216-228Google Scholar), the activation of Cdc42, one member of the Rho family of small GTPases, is required for the accumulation of N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex at the host cell-parasite interface during C. parvum cellular invasion (13Chen X.M. Huang B.Q. Splinter P.L. Orth J.D. Billadeau D.D. McNiven M.A. LaRusso N.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3011-3021Google Scholar). Activation of Cdc42 requires guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). These proteins stimulate the dissociation of GDP from the GDP-bound inactive form, resulting in the binding of GTP to form the GTP-bound active form, the activity of which is often regulated by an upstream signal. One of the GEFs for Cdc42 is frabin, a recently identified protein ubiquitously expressed and implicated in the mechanisms of Cdc42-associated actin remodeling (14Umikawa M. Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Satoh-Horikawa K. Takahashi K Hotta I Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 74: 25197-25200Google Scholar, 15Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Tanaka Y. Tachibana K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3457-3463Google Scholar). Frabin contains an F-actin binding (FAB) domain and two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (16Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishioka H. Takaishi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18697-18700Google Scholar). Proteins with PH domains can bind to phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (17Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Google Scholar, 18Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Google Scholar). One important signaling kinase implicated in actin polymerization and activated upon membrane stimulation by a variety of ligands is the class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Activation of PI3K catalyzes the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at cell membranes, thus resulting in the recruitment and activation of various signaling components to the cell membrane, some of which have been implicated in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, e.g. growth factor-induced membrane ruffling (19Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Google Scholar). Using an in vitro model of intestinal cryptosporidiosis, Forney et al. (8Forney J.R. DeWald D.B. Yang S. Speer C.A. Healey M.C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 844-852Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that a selective PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked C. parvum infection of cultured bovine fallopian tube epithelial cells. Thus, in this study, we tested the role of PI3K and frabin in C. parvum-induced Cdc42 activation in cellular invasion. We found that C. parvum infection of cultured human biliary epithelial cells induces the accumulation of PI3K at the host cell-parasite interface and results in the activation of PI3K in infected cells. Frabin is also recruited to the host cell-parasite interface, a process that is dependent upon PI3K. Both PI3K and frabin appear to be required for Cdc42 accumulation at the host cell-parasite interface. In addition, the inhibition of PI3K by either selective pharmacologic inhibitors or host cell overexpression of functionally deficient mutants of PI3K and frabin was associated with a reduction of C. parvum-induced actin remodeling and ultimately C. parvum invasion of biliary epithelia. These findings demonstrate that C. parvum invasion of biliary epithelial cells is facilitated by the recruitment and activation of PI3K in host cells, a process that activates the Cdc42 pathway via frabin and is required for C. parvum-induced actin remodeling and cellular invasion. C. parvum and H69 Cells—C. parvum oocysts of the Iowa strain were purchased from a commercial source (Pleasant Hill Farms, Troy, ID). Before infecting cells, oocysts were excysted to release infective sporozoites as described previously (7Chen X.M. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 368-379Google Scholar). H69 cells (a gift of Dr. D. Jefferson, Tufts University, Boston, MA) are SV40-transformed human bile duct epithelial cells originally derived from a normal liver harvested for transplant and have been characterized extensively (20Grubman S.A. Perrone R.D. Lee D.W. Murray S.L. Rogers L.C. Wolkoff L.I. Mulberg A.E. Cherington V. Jefferson D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G1060-G1070Google Scholar). For experiments, H69 cells were used between passages 23 and 30 and maintained for three passages without co-culture cells to ensure that the culture was free of 3T3 fibroblasts. In Vitro Models and Infection Assay—Two in vitro models, an attachment model and an attachment/invasion model, were employed to assay the attachment and invasion of C. parvum to H69 cells as described previously (7Chen X.M. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 368-379Google Scholar). H69 cells were seeded into 4-well chamber slides or 6-well Costar tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and grown to 70–80% confluence. For the attachment model, H69 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) in PBS before exposure to C. parvum sporozoites. In this model, the organism can only attach to the fixed cell surface. For the attachment/invasion model, live cells (without pre-fixation) were exposed directly to C. parvum sporozoites, thus allowing the organism to both attach to and enter into host cells. Infection with C. parvum was done in a culture medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Ham's F-12 medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and freshly excysted C. parvum sporozoites (1 × 106 sporozoites/slide well or culture plate). Inactivated organisms (treated at 65 °C for 30 min) were used for sham infection experiments (1O'Donoghue P.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1995; 25: 139-195Google Scholar). Infection assays (attachment rate or attachment/invasion rate) were carried out after a 2-h incubation with the parasite employing an indirect immunofluorescent technique as described previously (7Chen X.M. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 368-379Google Scholar). Parasites attaching to pre-fixed cells or invading non-fixed cells were counted, and the results were expressed, respectively, as attachment rate or attachment/invasion rate (the number of parasites/total number of cells × 100). Approximately 2,000 cells were counted for each assay. For the inhibitory experiments, two selective inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002 and wortmannin (21Maeda T. Kawane T. Horiuchi N. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 681-692Google Scholar), were added in the medium at the time C. parvum was added. A concentration of 10 μm LY294002 or 100 nm wortmannin showed no cytotoxic effects on H69 cells or on C. parvum sporozoites and was selected for the study. Transfection of Cells—H69 cells for transient transfection were grown to 40–60% confluency on 8-well chamber slides and transfected with 1 μg/well plasmid DNA using the LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The plasmid constructs for transient transfection included the following: pEF-BOSΔRI-PI3K-Δp85-HA (a dominant negative mutant of p85 regulatory subunit that cannot interact with the catalytic p110 subunit) (22Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T. Armstrong E.A. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7002-7010Google Scholar, 23Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20210-20216Google Scholar) and pEF-BOSΔRI-PI3K-p85-HA (wild type of the p85 subunit of PI3K) (gifts from Dr. L. M. Karnitz, Mayo Medical School, Rochester, MN); pKR5-Cdc42(17N)-Myc (a dominant negative mutant and a gift from Dr. A. Hall, University College London, London, United Kingdom) (25Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Google Scholar); and various constructs of frabin (14Umikawa M. Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Satoh-Horikawa K. Takahashi K Hotta I Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 74: 25197-25200Google Scholar, 15Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Tanaka Y. Tachibana K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3457-3463Google Scholar, 26Ono Y. Nakanishi H. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Satoh-Horikawa K. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Google Scholar) such as pCMV-Frabin-GFP, pCMV-Frabin-dead-Full-Myc (an internal deletion of amino acids 353–362 in the Dbl homology (DH) domain that abolishes Cdc42-activating activity), and pCMV-Frabin-dead-DH-PH1-Myc (a truncated mutant lacking of the FAB domain but containing the DH and PH1 domains with an internal deletion of amino acids 353–362 in the DH domain) (gifts from Dr. Y. Takai, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan). Empty vectors were used as controls. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were exposed to C. parvum sporozoites for the attachment and invasion assays. Immunofluorescent Microscopy—H69 cells were exposed to C. parvum sporozoites as described above. After 2 h of incubation, cells were fixed (0.1 mol/liter PIPES, pH 6.95, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 3 mmol/liter magnesium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2% paraformaldehyde) at 37 °C for 20 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. For double immunofluorescent labeling, fixed cells were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies to associated proteins mixed with a polyclonal antibody against C. parvum sporozoite membrane proteins (a generous gift from Drs. Guan Zhu and Janet Keithly, Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY) followed by rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse and fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Some cells were incubated with polyclonal antibodies to associated proteins mixed with a monoclonal antibody against C. parvum (2H2, ImmunuCell, Portland, ME) followed by rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse antibodies. To confirm the specificity of the staining, multiple antibodies from different sources were used for some of the proteins including two antibodies against Cdc42 (clone B8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology and a polyclonal antibody from Calbiochem), one monoclonal antibody and one polyclonal antibody to PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology), and a monoclonal antibody to frabin (clone 43, BD Transduction Laboratories). For localization of actin with C. parvum, rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) was co-incubated with the secondary antibody. For triple immunofluorescent labeling in experiments with the transient transfected cells, monoclonal antibodies to the c-Myc epitope tag (clone 9B11, Cell Signaling) or HA epitope tag (clone 262K, Cell Signaling) were used to identify the transfected cells. The cells were co-stained with another antibody against the associated protein plus rhodamine-phalloidin to stain actin or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (5 μmol/liter) to label the parasite (which stains the nuclei of both the host cells and the parasite in blue) (8Forney J.R. DeWald D.B. Yang S. Speer C.A. Healey M.C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 844-852Google Scholar). Labeled cells were rinsed three times with PBS and once with distilled water, mounted with mounting medium (H-1000, Vector Laboratories), and assessed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The numbers of parasites with and without accumulation of associated proteins at the host cell-parasite interface were counted separately for quantitative analysis. Those with the obvious accumulation of each associated protein were counted as positive, and the results were expressed as the accumulation percentage (the number of parasites with an accumulation of the molecules at the host cell-parasite interface/total number of parasites × 100). Between 500 and 1000 C. parvum cells were counted randomly for each assay. Images obtained from the Zeiss 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc. Oberkochen, Germany) were manipulated uniformly for contrast and intensity using the Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, CA) software. Immunoprecipitation and Phosphotyrosine of PI3K—H69 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes to 95% confluence and exposed to C. parvum sporozoites at 37 °C for 1 and 2 h. Cells then were rinsed with PBS and scraped into 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 20 μg/ml and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, sodium orthovanadate and sodium fluoride, at 1 mm. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and were assayed for protein concentration using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lysates (1 mg of protein) then were incubated with 10 μl of anti-PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight to immunoprecipitate PI3K. Immune complexes were collected by direct binding to protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated protein then was released with Western sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1.25 m Tris, pH 6.8), incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with an antibody to phosphotyrosine (Clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). PI3K and Cdc42 Activity Assay—PI3K activity was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). H69 cells were grown on 10-cm dishes to 95% confluency and exposed to C. parvum sporozoites at 37 °C for 1 and 2 h. PI3K protein was immunoprecipitated, and the activity of PI3K was determined using a commercial ELISA kit (Echelon Biosciences Inc.). The activity of PI3K was expressed as the picomole of product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate/1 mg protein. A pull-down assay was employed to measure Cdc42 activation in H69 cells after exposure to C. parvum as described previously (13Chen X.M. Huang B.Q. Splinter P.L. Orth J.D. Billadeau D.D. McNiven M.A. LaRusso N.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3011-3021Google Scholar, 27Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar, 28Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar). H69 cells were grown on T75 flasks to 95% confluency and exposed to C. parvum sporozoites at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells then were chilled on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The cell lysates then were incubated with GST-Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain bound to glutathione-coupled agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min at 4 °C, washed with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and eluted with SDS sample buffer with 200 mm dithiothreitol. GTP-bound active Cdc42 was analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to Cdc42. PI3K Is Recruited to the Host Cell-Parasite Interface and Is Activated—To test the role of PI3K in the mechanism of host cell actin-dependent invasion of epithelia by C. parvum, we used double immunofluorescent labeling for C. parvum and PI3K. Very strong staining of PI3K was observed at the C. parvum host cell-parasite interface (Fig. 1, A and B). No accumulation of PI3K was detected in sham-infected control cells, and no positive staining of PI3K was found in the parasite itself (data not shown). Quantitative analysis showed 96.7 ± 2.5% of the host cell-parasite interfaces with an accumulation of PI3K. Ligand-stimulated activation of class IA PI3K is dependent upon the phosphorylation of Tyr688 of its p85 subunit (29Cuevas B.D. Lu Y. Mao M. Zhang J. LaPushin R. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27455-27461Google Scholar). To test whether C. parvum infection induces the phosphorylation of this p85 subunit in host cells, biliary epithelia were exposed to C. parvum, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an antibody to PI3K, and the immunoprecipitates were blotted for phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 1C, phosphotyrosine in the p85 subunit was detected at 1 and 2 h after exposure to C. parvum. Activation of PI3K was determined further by ELISA using the immunoprecipitate as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1D, cells exposed to C. parvum for 1 and 2 h showed a marked increase in PI3K activity compared with the sham-infected control cells. PI3K-dependent Accumulation of Frabin at the Host Cell-Parasite Interface—To test whether frabin is involved in C. parvum cellular invasion, accumulation of frabin at the host cell-parasite interface was measured first by double immunofluorescent labeling using a monoclonal antibody to frabin and a polyclonal antibody to C. parvum. Strong staining of frabin was observed at the C. parvum host cell-parasite interface (Fig. 2, A1 and A2). No accumulation of frabin in the sham-infected cells or positive staining in the parasite itself was found with the procedure used in the experiments (data not shown). To further confirm the specificity of frabin staining with the antibody, a GFP-frabin construct was used to transfect cells before exposure to C. parvum sporozoites followed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, B1 and B2, GFP-frabin also was found to be recruited to the host cell-parasite interface. To define whether C. parvum-induced frabin accumulation at the host cell-parasite interface is dependent upon PI3K activation, LY294002 and wortmannin, two selective PI3K inhibitors (21Maeda T. Kawane T. Horiuchi N. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 681-692Google Scholar), and PI3K-Δp85, a dominant negative mutant p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K unable to interact with the catalytic p110 subunit thus blocking PI3K activity (22Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T. Armstrong E.A. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7002-7010Google Scholar, 23Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20210-20216Google Scholar), were used. As shown in Fig. 2, C1–D2, a significant decrease in frabin accumulation was found at the host cell-parasite interface in cells treated with LY294002 or transfected with PI3K-Δp85. A similar inhibition of frabin accumulation was detected in cells treated with wortmannin (data not shown). Quantitative analysis showed a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in frabin accumulation in the presence of PI3K inhibitors and in cells transfected with PI3K-Δp85 compared with cells in the absence of inhibitors or cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that the recruitment of a Cdc42-specific GEF to the host cell-parasite interface requires the activation of PI3K. To test the possibility that frabin may be required for PI3K accumulation at the host cell-parasite interface, we tested the effects of functionally deficient mutates of frabin on PI3K accumulation. H69 cells were transfected transiently with Frabin-dead-Full or Frabin-DH-PH1, two functionally deficient mutants of frabin (14Umikawa M. Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Satoh-Horikawa K. Takahashi K Hotta I Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 74: 25197-25200Google Scholar, 15Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Tanaka Y. Tachibana K. Takai Y.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Google Scholar), and then exposed to C. parvum followed by co-staining of PI3K. Accumulation of PI3K was found both in cells transfected with Frabin-dead-Full (arrowheads in Fig. 3A2) or Frabin-DH-PH1 (arrowheads in Fig. 3, B2) and in the non-transfected cells (arrows in Fig. 3, A2 and B2). Quantitative analysis showed no significant difference in PI3K accumulation between transfected and non-transfected cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that frabin is not required for the accumulation of PI3K during C. parvum invasion of biliary epithelial cells. Accumulation/Activation of Cdc42 at the Host Cell-Parasite Interface Requires PI3K and Frabin—Our previous studies indicated that C. parvum cellular invasion activates the Cdc42-Arp/N-WASP network to induce actin remodeling at the attachment site, thus facilitating C. parvum cellular invasion (13Chen X.M. Huang B.Q. Splinter P.L. Orth J.D. Billadeau D.D. McNiven M.A. LaRusso N.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3011-3021Google Scholar). To clarify the relationship between PI3K/Frabin signaling pathways and the Cdc42-Arp/N-WASP network during C. parvum cellular invasion, C. parvum-induced Cdc42 accumulation was explored in cells treated with PI3K inhibitors or in cells transfected with PI3K-Δp85 or various mutants of frabin. Consistent with our previous studies (13Chen X.M. Huang B.Q. Splinter P.L. Orth J.D. Billadeau D.D. McNiven M.A. LaRusso N.F. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3011-3021Google Scholar), a strong accumulation of Cdc42 was observed at the host cell-parasite interface in the absence of PI3K inhibitors (Fig. 4, A1 and A2) with 93.7 ± 1.3% of the attachment sites accumulated with Cdc42. A significant decrease in Cdc42 accumulation at the host cell-parasite interface was observed in cells treated with LY294002 (Fig. 4, B1 and B2) or transfected with PI3K-Δp85 (Fig. 4, C1 and C2). A decrease in Cdc42 accumulation also was found in cells transfected with the Frabin-DH-PH1 (Fig. 4, D1 and D2). Quantitative analysis showed a significant decrease in Cdc42 accu"
https://openalex.org/W1987584727,"Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta is a potent regulator of cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions (collectively termed cellular adhesions). Cellular adhesions play crucial roles in controlling the differentiation of epithelial cells and in maintaining the integrity of the epithelium. Loss of TGF beta-responsiveness is thought to be an important early initiating event in the malignant progression of epithelial cancer. In the TGFbeta-responsive human colon adenocarcinoma Moser cells, TGFbeta promotes cellular adhesions and suppresses their malignant phenotype. TGFbeta promotes cell-matrix adhesion by inducing the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules and the expression of integrin receptors for these molecules (termed ECM remodeling). TGFbeta promotes cell-cell adhesion through the induction of E-cadherin expression, an epithelial associated homotypic cell-cell adhesion molecule, which also functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. How TGFbeta regulates E-cadherin expression is not known. In this study, we showed that the induction of E-cadherin by TGFbeta was mediated through the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a major signaling molecule in focal adhesion contacts and that the activation of FAK was due to ECM remodeling and increased cell-matrix interactions. Thus, TGFbeta regulates cell-cell adhesion through its ability to remodel the ECM and to activate FAK through ECM remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2163966106,"Conversion of the cellular α-helical prion protein (PrPC) into a disease-associated isoform (PrPSc) is central to the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Molecules targeting either normal or disease-associated isoforms may be of therapeutic interest, and the antibodies binding PrPC have been shown to inhibit prion accumulation in vitro. Here we investigate whether antibodies that additionally target disease-associated isoforms such as PrPSc inhibit prion replication in ovine PrP-inducible scrapie-infected Rov cells. We conclude from these experiments that antibodies exclusively binding PrPC were relatively inefficient inhibitors of ScRov cell PrPSc accumulation compared with antibodies that additionally targeted disease-associated PrP isoforms. Although the mechanism by which these monoclonal antibodies inhibit prion replication is unclear, some of the data suggest that antibodies might actively increase PrPSc turnover. Thus antibodies that bind to both normal and disease-associated isoforms represent very promising anti-prion agents.

Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The recent emergence of a new human prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, almost certainly resulting from the human consumption of bovine spongiform encephalopathy-infected material (1Collinge J. Lancet. 1999; 354: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) is a major public health and safety issue (2Ghani A.C. Ferguson N.M. Donnelly C.A. Anderson R.M.

The infectious agent or prion is mainly composed of PrPSc, 1The abbreviations used are: PrPSc, disease-associated isoform of prion protein; PrPC, cellular prion protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DS500, dextran sulfate 500; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: PrPSc, disease-associated isoform of prion protein; PrPC, cellular prion protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DS500, dextran sulfate 500; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a detergent-insoluble and partially protease-resistant isoform of the host-encoded cellular prion protein, PrPC (4Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4014) Google Scholar). According to the protein-only hypothesis, in the course of prion infection, α-helical PrPC is refolded without post-translational modification into β-sheet-rich PrPSc, initially in the presence of exogenous PrPSc and then by an autocatalytic process (5Clarke A.R. Jackson G.S. Collinge J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Currently, no treatment of prion disease is effective once neurological illness has developed, but any molecule able to interact with either one or both isoforms could potentially delay or even cure the disease (6Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) efficiently inhibit PrPSc accumulation in ScN2a mouse neuroblastoma cells (7Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9295-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and in infected transgenic mice engineered to produce one of these mAbs, 6H4 (9Heppner F.L. Musahl C. Arrighi I. Klein M.A. Rulicke T. Oesch B. Zinkernagel R.M. Kalinke U. Aguzzi A. Science. 2001; 294: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Their efficiency was related directly to their epitope and to their affinity for PrPC (10Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. SchulzSchaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 11Williamson R.A. Peretz D.

We also have recently reported that mAbs effectively suppress systemic prion replication in vivo (12White A.R. Enever P. Tayebi M. Mushens R. Linehan J. Brandner S. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Nature. 2003; 422: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In that study, two mAbs with differential affinity for normal and disease-associated isoforms of prion protein were used: ICSM 18, which almost exclusively binds to PrPC, and ICSM 35, which efficiently binds to both normal and disease-associated isoforms. Both mAbs were efficient equally at delaying the onset of prion disease in the treated mice, but it was unclear whether the additional targeting of PrPSc by ICSM 35 played a role in controlling prion replication. In this study, we have used a larger panel of mAbs raised in PrPC null mice (Prnp0/0) against the α and β isoforms of human recombinant PrP (13Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) to inhibit prion replication in scrapieinfected epithelial Rov (ScRov) cells (14Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Rov cell PrPC expression is inducible by doxycycline, thereby allowing the clearance of PrPSc to be studied in the absence of its PrPC substrate. Here we show that mAbs that additionally target disease-associated isoforms of PrP block PrPSc accumulation much more efficiently than mAbs recognizing PrPC alone. We also found that the inhibition by several mAbs was similar and even greater than turning off the production of the PrPC substrate, suggesting antibody-mediated enhancement of the proteolysis of intracellular PrPSc. Production of Monoclonal Antibodies—The panel of ICSM mAbs was produced as described previously (15Beringue V. Mallinson G. Kaisar M. Tayebi M. Sattar Z. Jackson G. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Brain. 2003; 126: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). They were affinity-purified from hybridoma culture supernatant over the protein A or G matrix (Äkta Prime, Amersham Biosciences), filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C. Treatment of ScRov Cells with the ICSM Antibodies—ScRov cells were grown in 24-well plates as described previously (14Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was present in the culture medium unless mentioned. A triplicate of ScRov cells was treated with the ICSM mAbs once a week just after splitting. The controls were either left untreated or treated with isotype control mAb (15Beringue V. Mallinson G. Kaisar M. Tayebi M. Sattar Z. Jackson G. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Brain. 2003; 126: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Avent N. Judson P.A. Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J. Evans P.R. Hodges E. Maciver A.G. Holmes C. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In one experiment, the cells were exposed to similar concentrations of dextran sulfate 500 (DS500, Sigma). One quarter of the cells was passaged weekly, and the residual cells (typically ∼24 × 104 cells or 80 μg of proteins) were pelleted, lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and stored at –80 °C for subsequent analysis. PrPSc was extracted from 40 μg of protein by 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. The protein was then denatured with 3 volumes of Laemmli buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) for 5 min at 100 °C before an additional concentration of the protein with cold acetone. Typically, 15 μg of proteins (i.e. the equivalent of 45 × 103 cells) were used for Western blots (see below). Immunoprecipitation—Scrapie-infected and -uninfected Rov cells were washed three times in cold PBS and scraped in cold lysis buffer. A mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) in addition to 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added prior to (Rov cells) or after proteinase K treatment (ScRov cells) at 50 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Lysates then were incubated with 10 μg/ml purified mAbs in lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. Negative controls omitted the capture mAb or used the relevant isotype control (15Beringue V. Mallinson G. Kaisar M. Tayebi M. Sattar Z. Jackson G. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Brain. 2003; 126: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Avent N. Judson P.A. Parsons S.F.

The immune complexes were adsorbed overnight onto protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed 4–5 times according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were re-suspended in Laemmli buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and pelleted at 12,000 × g to detach/denature the bound protein. The supernatant was analyzed by Western blot (see below). For live cell immunoprecipitation, Rov cells were incubated overnight with 10 μg/ml ICSM mAbs in the culture medium. The protocol then was similar with the exception that the lysates were incubated directly with protein G-agarose beads. The bound fraction was compared with the total levels of PrPC, which corresponds to the unbound fraction when immunoprecipitation is performed with the relevant isotype controls. This fraction was precipitated by cold acetone, re-suspended in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. Immunofluorescence—Rov and ScRov cells were incubated overnight on slides with 10 μg/ml ICSM mAbs. Controls were left untreated or treated with isotype control (15Beringue V. Mallinson G. Kaisar M. Tayebi M. Sattar Z. Jackson G. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Brain. 2003; 126: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Avent N. Judson P.A. Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J. Evans P.R. Hodges E. Maciver A.G. Holmes C. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After three washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After several washes, the cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1/400 dilution of an isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb (P.A.R.I.S, Paris, France) in 5% milk in PBS. After three washes in PBS, slides were mounted in antifading solution (Dabko) and kept in the dark at 4 °C until microscopic analysis with the Nikon fluorescent microscope. Western Blotting—Samples were run on 12% polyacrylamide Criterion gels (Bio-Rad) or 12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and immunoblotted with 0.1–0.2 μg/ml of the biotinylated anti-PrP antibody, ICSM 18. Immunoreactivity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit on autoradiographic films (ECL+, Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analyses of the films were performed with the program NIH Image (Waine Rasband, National Institutes of Health) as described previously (18Beringue V. Adjou K.T. Lamoury F. Maignien T. Deslys J.P. Race R. Dormont D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5432-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The amount of PrPSc was estimated by comparison with a dilution scale of sheep scrapie PrPSc prepared in similar conditions and at the same time. Monoclonal Antibodies Raised against β-PrP Inhibit More Efficiently PrPSc Accumulation in ScRov Cells—In initial studies, we assessed how efficiently ICSM 4, 17, 18, and 19 raised against α-PrP and ICSM 35 raised against β-PrP inhibited prion replication (Table I). ICSM 18 and ICSM 17 recognize residues 146–159 and 140–159 of murine PrP. ICSM 35 recognizes residues 96 and 109 on the N-terminal region of PrP27–30. The epitopes of ICSM 4 and 19 are not definable with overlapping synthetic peptides and may be conformation-dependent (Table I) (15Beringue V. Mallinson G. Kaisar M. Tayebi M. Sattar Z. Jackson G. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Brain. 2003; 126: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Triplicate cultures of ScRov cells were treated with mAb concentrations ranging from 10 ng/ml to 10 μg/ml. The treatment was renewed once a week when the cells were split, as we identified by ELISA that the concentration in the culture supernatant fell only by 50% over each treatment period. Cells were collected each week, and the level of PrPSc was assessed by Western blot. ScRov cells also were treated with various concentrations of the anti-prion drug DS500, known to potently inhibit prion replication in other scrapie-infected cell lines (19Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, DS500 rapidly inhibited PrPSc accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 110 ng/ml (0.22 nm) after 3 weeks treatment (Fig. 1, a and b). When compared with DS500, mAb ICSM 35 (raised against β-PrP) was a more potent inhibitor (IC50, 4 ng/ml or 0.03 nm) (Fig. 1, a and b). Among the mAbs raised against α-PrP, ICSM 19 and ICSM 18 were ∼100 and 1500 times less efficient (IC50 of 360 ng/ml (3.30 nm) and 5 μg/ml (45.5 nm), respectively) (Fig. 1a). 1 μg/ml ICSM 19 strongly inhibited PrPSc accumulation after 6 weeks of treatment, whereas ICSM 18 at this dose could not prevent PrPSc accumulation (Fig. 1b). ICSM 4 and 17 were unable to inhibit PrPSc accumulation, even after prolonged treatment with 10 μg/ml (Table I). None of the mAbs modified PrPC expression regardless of the dose or length of treatment used (data not shown), indicating that they did not exhibit any toxicity for the cells. After 6 weeks treatment with 1 μg/ml DS500, ICSM 35, or ICSM 19, PrPSc levels were lowered 100–1000-fold (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, when the inhibitor was washed off, PrPSc reaccumulated (Fig. 1, b and c). Cells treated with ICSM 19, and DS500 reached control values 6 weeks after the treatment was stopped. At this point, those treated with ICSM 35 still accumulated ∼5 times less PrPSc than the controls (Fig. 1, b and c). This confirmed that ICSM 35 was a more potent inhibitor than ICSM 19 and DS500.Table IInhibition of ScRov PrPScaccumulation by ICSM monoclonal antibodiesICSMImmunogenaα and β refer to human recombinant α- and β-PrP91-231.EpitopebResidue numbering refers to mouse prion protein sequence.ImmunoreactivitydEstimated by at least three independent immunoprecipitation experiments and compared with the affinity obtained with ICSM 35.InhibitioneObserved at the 10 μg/ml dose after 3 weeks of treatment.PrPcC, conformational epitope.PrPSc% ± S.D.4αC37 ± 80-6αC27 ± 140-7αC26 ± 170-17α140-15926 ± 110-18α146-159183 ± 84 ± 1+19αC91 ± 260++41αC162 ± 444-44αC58 ± 373-35β96-109100100+++++37β96-109109 ± 8190 ± 7++++++42β96-10994 ± 2290 ± 4+++++a α and β refer to human recombinant α- and β-PrP91-231.b Residue numbering refers to mouse prion protein sequence.c C, conformational epitope.d Estimated by at least three independent immunoprecipitation experiments and compared with the affinity obtained with ICSM 35.e Observed at the 10 μg/ml dose after 3 weeks of treatment. Open table in a new tab PrPC expression in Rov cells is controlled by doxycycline (14Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), allowing a comparison of the efficiency of antibody-mediated PrPSc clearance to turning off the PrPC promoter, the latter representing the maximal inhibition achievable by pure PrPC targeting. ScRov cells were treated with ICSM 19 (raised against α-PrP), ICSM 35 (raised against β-PrP), or control mAbs (each at 10 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of doxycycline. With doxycycline removed from the culture medium, the PrPSc half-life was 3 ± 0.2 days (Fig. 2). This was similar to treatment with ICSM 35 (Fig. 2, PrPSc half-life of 3.5 ± 0.5 days). Interestingly, both mechanisms of inhibition were synergistic, because ICSM 35 added to the cells in which doxycycline has just been removed induced an even faster clearance of PrPSc (Fig. 2, half-life 2.1 ± 0.3 day; p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, inhibition by ICSM 19 was much slower than turning off the PrPC substrate (PrPSc half-life 16 ± 4.4 days) (Fig. 2). Two other mAbs raised against β-PrP were similarly potent. In fact PrPSc clearance with ICSM 37 was significantly faster than with ICSM 35 and even faster than turning off the PrPC promoter (Fig. 3; p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Inhibition induced by ICSM 42 was similar to ICSM 35 (Table I and data not shown). In contrast, other mAbs raised against α-PrP (ICSM 6, 7, 41, and 44) failed to reduce PrPSc levels even after 3 weeks treatment with 10 μg/ml (Table I). Monoclonal Antibodies Raised against β-PrP-immunoprecipitated ScRov Cell PrPSc—One possible explanation for the differences observed in efficacy between the mAbs tested was that they differentially recognized normal and disease-associated isoforms of PrP. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated PrPC and the protease-resistant core of PrPSc (PrP27–30) from Rov and ScRov cells lysates. All of the mAbs reacted with PrPC, ICSM 18 exhibiting about twice the affinity of any mAbs raised against β-PrP (Table I and Fig. 4a, left panel). In stark contrast, only mAbs raised against β-PrP reacted strongly with PrP27–30, ICSM 37 immunoprecipitating 2-fold more PrPSc than ICSM 35 and 42 at an equivalent concentration (Table I and Fig. 4a, right panel). We then pulsed uninfected Rov cells with ICSM 18 or ICSM 19 (10 μg/ml overnight) and immunoprecipitated the PrPC-bound fraction after thoroughly washing the cells. Interestingly, ICSM 18 and ICSM 19 bound 62 ± 3 and 75 ± 10% PrPC molecules, whereas ICSM 35 and 37 bound, respectively, only 14 ± 3 and 33 ± 4% (Fig. 4, b and c). Similar experiments on ScRov cells were inconclusive, as we frequently observed non-specific binding of PrPSc to the beads used to bring down the antigen/antibody complexes (data not shown). However ICSM 35 and 37 do bind PrPSc in living cells. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found dotlike intracellular staining in ScRov cells (as indicated by an arrow) but not in Rov cells (Fig. 4d). This was similar to the staining of fixed ScRov cells with these mAbs after guanidium thiocyanate denaturation, 2V. Beringue and F. Archer, unpublished data. a treatment known to increase specifically PrPSc immunoreactivity (20Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Archer F. Bachelin C. Andreoletti O. Besnard N. Perrot G. Langevin C. Le Dur A. Vilette D. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Vilotte J.L. Laude H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, we were unable to observe any differences in the binding of ICSM 18 and 19 between Rov and ScRov cells (Fig. 4d). Overall, these experiments indicate that mAbs raised against β-PrP bind endogenous intracellular PrPSc. Given that the transformation of normal cellular prion protein is central to the pathogenesis of prion disease, it is not surprising that most of the available therapeutic strategies target either normal or disease-related isoforms. However, success has been limited when translating methods that were shown to be effective in vitro to animal models and patients (22Brown P. Neurology. 2002; 58: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Studies in neuroblastoma cells clearly indicate that targeting PrPC either by cleaving it from the cell surface with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or stabilizing it with monoclonal antibodies inhibits prion replication very efficiently (7Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9295-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our system, turning off the ovine PrP promoter completely abrogates prion replication (this study and Ref. 14Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), analogous to the situation in PrP null mice that do not support prion replication (24Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). However, not all PrPC-binding antibodies have inhibitory effects (Table I). Peretz et al. (8Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) elegantly show that artificially engineered Fabs were most potent when they targeted helix 1, a region to which ICSM 18 and mAb 6H4 bind (10Korth C.

Brain. 2003; 126: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fabs binding the 90–109 region also inhibited prion replication (8Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), although interestingly, these artificially engineered antibodies do not recognize native PrPSc (11Williamson R.A. Peretz D. Pinilla C. Ball H. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. Houghten R.A. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9413-9418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), unlike our mAbs raised against β-PrP in which the 90–109 region is immunodominant (this study). 3V. Beringue, G. Mallinson, M. Kaisar, M. Tayebi, and S. Hawke, unpublished observations. It is of some concern for the general applicability of cell lines as systems for screening anti-prion agents that prion replication in ScRov cells was inhibited inefficiently by mAbs binding helix 1 such as ICSM 18 that clearly have a very high affinity for PrPC and very efficiently inhibit the replication of mouse prions in ScN2a 3V. Beringue, G. Mallinson, M. Kaisar, M. Tayebi, and S. Hawke, unpublished observations. cells and in mice (12White A.R. Enever P. Tayebi M. Mushens R. Linehan J. Brandner S. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Nature. 2003; 422: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Although targeting PrPC exclusively is clearly an effective strategy in some cell lines, failure to inhibit infectious prions may allow the conversion to recur once the PrPC-binding inhibitor is removed. Thus infection is merely suppressed and not eradicated. Previous work indicates that ScN2a cells are curable with anti-PrPC antibodies (7Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9295-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), but clearly this does not apply to all cells capable of supporting prion replication as we show here. Perhaps this is mainly due to the level of PrPC.Itis worth noting that the clone successfully treated by mAb 6H4 expressed very low levels of PrPC (7Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9295-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) compared with Rov cells that express similar levels of PrPC to those found in sheep brain (14Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One might anticipate that differential sensitivity to anti-prion agents may exist similarly in vivo, and continuous suppression with high concentrations of inhibitor may be required given that PrPC is widely expressed in variable amounts and rapidly turned over at the cell surface (25Bendheim P.E. Brown H.R. Rudelli R.D. Scala L.J. Goller N.L. Wen G.Y. Kascsak R.J. Cashman N.R. Bolton D.C. Neurology. 1992; 42: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taraboulos A. Raeber A.J. Borchelt D.R. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Such a strategy may be employed with caution during the neuroinvasion course of the disease, because the administration of high doses of mAbs with high affinity for PrPC within the central nervous system may trigger neuronal apoptosis in vivo (27Solforosi L. Criado J.R. McGavern D.B. Wirz S. Sanchez-Alavez M. Sugama S. DeGiorgio L.A. Volpe B.T. Wiseman E. Abalos G. Masliah E. Gilden D. Oldstone M.B. Conti B. Williamson R.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). An alternative strategy is to target both PrPC and PrPSc, thereby blocking the incorporation of PrPC into propagating prions and additionally capping the infectious template. In these experiments, it was striking that the ability of each mAb to suppress prion replication correlated so well with its affinity for PrPSc but not for PrPC (Table I). Therefore it seems reasonable to suggest that PrPSc binding plays the major effector role, but differences between species and/or strains cannot be excluded despite helix I being highly conserved between species (28Oesch B. Westaway D. Prusiner S.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 172: 109-124PubMed Google Scholar). The most potent mAbs bound significantly less PrPC than ISCM 18, and immunofluorescence confirmed that the mAbs raised against β-PrP bound disease-associated prion protein. In fact these studies correlated very well with the indirect immunoprecipitation. Thus mAbs exhibiting high affinity for PrPSc by immunoprecipitation stained intracellular organelles and inhibited prion replication very efficiently. Clearly, unless mAbs completely specific for PrPSc are used, it will not be possible to conclusively prove that PrPSc binding is crucial. It is possible, for example, that ovine PrPC is stabilized most efficiently by interactions at the 90–109 region. In any case, PrPC binding may be necessary for the mAbs to be internalized and/or presented to intracellular PrPSc. Currently, we are attempting to characterize mAbs that bind PrPSc exclusively and mAbs that bind to the N-terminal portion of PrP27–30 but that have low affinity for PrPSc (such as mAb 3F4) (29Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, taken together, we suggest that additional targeting of PrPSc may improve the efficacy of anti-prion agents. How could the mAbs interact with PrPSc? This may be direct if the PrPC conversion occurred at the cell surface (23Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown by immunofluorescence that our mAbs are internalized in contrast with recent studies in human cells (30Paitel E. Alves Da Costa C. Vilette D. Grassi J. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). If conversion occurred in endosomes, the antibodies may be internalized via PrPC and then bind to PrPSc whether or not they were released from PrPC. We did not find by immunofluorescence Fc receptors at the Rov cell surface, making Fc-mediated internalization of the mAbs unlikely (data not shown). Finally, the Rov cell system allowed a comparison of the kinetics of PrPSc inhibition to be studied in the absence of the PrPC substrate. Again, supporting a direct role for PrPSc binding, we found that several mAbs inhibited as rapidly as repressing PrPC expression and that one mAb, ICSM 37, was even more rapid, suggesting that it enhanced the breakdown of PrPSc. Interestingly, PrPSc was not released from the cells into the supernatant (data not shown). Perhaps mAb binding facilitates the intracellular clearance of PrPSc. Pulse-chase experiments are planned to study this intriguing phenomenon in greater detail. How does the work described here apply to our recent in vivo data (12White A.R. Enever P. Tayebi M. Mushens R. Linehan J. Brandner S. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Nature. 2003; 422: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar)? We have recently shown that both ICSM 18 and 35 effectively inhibit prion replication in vivo. In these experiments, it was not determined by which mechanism prion replication was inhibited or whether the infection was eradicated or merely suppressed. The fact that spleen PrPSc levels were lowered more efficiently with ICSM 18 compared with ICSM 35 and that the former mAb binds to native mouse PrPSc weakly suggests that targeting PrPC was the predominant inhibitory mechanism. Yet ICSM 35 was equally efficient at delaying the onset of clinical scrapie, and it is possible that the dose response curves for clinical effectiveness may not mirror those for PrPSc levels in the spleen. Isotype differences may also be relevant. Unfortunately, the short half-life of antibody fragments precludes a direct comparison of the variable regions without elaborate genetic engineering. Two reports using ScN2a cells have suggested that prion-infected cultures could be cured after long term treatment with antibodies (7Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9295-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R. Legname G. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Nature. 2001; 412: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, the ScN2a cells have levels of infectivity that are much lower than the ScRov cells (31Sabuncu E. Petit S. Le Dur A. Lan Lai T. Vilotte J.L. Laude H. Vilette D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2696-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and therefore may be easier to cure. We showed in one of our experiments that mAb treatment of ScRov cells resulted in a 100–1000-fold decrease in PrPSc levels (Fig. 1). However, replication re-started when the treatment was stopped, an effect noted with both antibodies and DS500. This finding indicates that a cellular reservoir of PrPSc remained untouched by the antibodies or DS500 providing a template for conversion to recur. It is tempting to speculate that aggregates of PrPSc may be involved. Several sites of post-exposure therapeutic intervention could be envisaged in prion diseases. One comprises the central nervous system, and in vitro investigations in ScN2a cells have shown that mAbs might also in theory prevent PrPSc accumulation in neurons (7Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9295-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Kaneko K. Vergara J. Leclerc E. Schmitt-Ulms G. Mehlhorn I.R.

Our study has shown that mAbs also were able to prevent PrPSc production in an epithelial cell line. These cells may play an important role in the spread of the infection in periphery (32Heppner F.L. Christ A.D. Klein M.A. Prinz M. Fried M. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Aguzzi A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 976-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, the engineering of transgenic mice to produce anti-prion mAbs (9Heppner F.L. Musahl C. Arrighi I. Klein M.A. Rulicke T. Oesch B. Zinkernagel R.M. Kalinke U. Aguzzi A. Science. 2001; 294: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) or passive immunization (12White A.R. Enever P. Tayebi M. Mushens R. Linehan J. Brandner S. Anstee D. Collinge J. Hawke S. Nature. 2003; 422: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) have shown that they could prevent the generation of infectivity in the spleen when these mice were infected with scrapie. Therefore, antibodies may target different pathways of prion pathogenesis encompassing the transit from the site of infection, its early propagation in periphery and more lately in the central nervous system, and thus be an efficient therapy regardless of the incubation stage in the infected individuals.

Elevated [K+]o for 1–16 hr severely depressed glutamate signaling, while mildly depressing GABA transmission. The glutamate-specific changes were plastic over several hours and involved a decrease in the size of the pool of releasable vesicles. Rather than a reduction of the number of vesicles per release site, the change involved functional elimination of release sites. This change was clearly dissociable from a second effect, depressed probability of transmitter release, which was common to both glutamate and GABA transmission. Thus, while other recent evidence links alteration of the releasable pool size with changes in pr, our results suggest the two can be independently manipulated. Selective depression of glutamate release may provide an adaptive mechanism by which neurons limit excitotoxicity."

Here we used a S. cerevisiae assay for characterizing gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) to analyze genome instability in post-senescent telomerase-deficient cells. Telomerase-deficient tlc1 and est2 mutants did not have increased GCR rates, but their telomeres could be joined to other DNAs resulting in chromosome fusions. Inactivation of Tel1 or either the Rad51 or Rad59 recombination pathways in telomerase-deficient cells increased the GCR rate, even though telomeres were maintained. The GCRs were translocations and chromosome fusions formed by nonhomologous end joining. We observed chromosome fusions only in mutant strains expressing Rad51 and Rad55 or when Tel1 was inactivated. In contrast, inactivation of Mec1 resulted in more inversion translocations such as the isochromosomes seen in human tumors. These inversion translocations seemed to be formed by recombination after replication of broken chromosomes."

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; SRE, sterol-responsive element; ARE, androgen response element; FCS, fetal calf serum; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; AR, androgen receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. represent an important family of transcription regulators (SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2) controlling intracellular lipid homeostasis (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). SREBPs are synthesized as 125-kDa inactive precursor proteins, and immediately upon their synthesis they are inserted into the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum where they form tight complexes with an escort protein known as the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). SCAP plays a pivotal role in the control of SREBP signaling. In fact, SCAP does not only bind SREBP but, through its amino-terminal sterol-sensing domain, it also interacts with a retention protein complex consisting of at least two endoplasmic reticulum proteins (designated insulin-induced gene 1 and 2; Insig 1 and 2) that serve to retain the SREBP·SCAP complex into the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. In the “classical” SREBP activation pathway, a decrease in the intracellular concentration of sterols changes the conformation of the sterol-sensing part of SCAP, weakens its interaction with the retention proteins, and allows translocation of the SREBP·SCAP complex to the Golgi apparatus where SREBP is proteolytically cleaved and activated. The active 68-kDa SREBP fragment migrates to the nucleus where it increases the transcription of a large set of sterol-responsive element (SRE) containing genes encoding lipogenic enzymes belonging to the pathways of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (1Brown M.S.

Our studies on the mechanisms by which androgens provoke a coordinated activation of lipogenic pathways in androgen-responsive prostate tumor lines have suggested an alternative pathway of SREBP activation in which androgens change the expression rather than the conformation of SCAP (8Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Heemers H. Maes B. Foufelle F. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this pathway, increased expression of SCAP shifts the balance between SCAP and its retention proteins and favors translocation of the SREBP·SCAP complex to the Golgi apparatus. Evidence for the existence of this pathway was derived from several observations (9Heemers H. Maes B. Foufelle F. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 1) In two independent prostate tumor lines (LNCaP and MDA-PCa-2a) androgens cause major changes in the expression of SCAP both at the mRNA and at the protein level, whereas no or only minor changes were observed for other critical components of the SREBP pathway (the SREBP precursor proteins SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2; the site 1 and site 2 proteases responsible for SREBP cleavage). 2) The observed increase in SCAP expression was shown to be a cause rather than a consequence of SREBP activation. Induction of SCAP expression coincided with nuclear translocation of SREBP but preceded the increased expression of lipogenic genes involved in cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, activation of SREBP signaling by an alternative route (sterol depletion) did not result in SCAP induction. 3) Overexpression of SCAP could be shown to result in activation of the SREBP pathway. Because experiments with actinomycin D indicated that the stimulatory effects of androgens on SCAP require transcriptional activity (9Heemers H. Maes B. Foufelle F. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we wanted to answer the question of whether SCAP is a direct target for androgen action. To this end we performed a systematic search for cis-acting regulatory sequences in the SCAP gene that might mediate the effects of androgens. Here we describe the identification and characterization of an androgen response element (ARE) located within intron 8 of the SCAP gene. Cell Culture—The human prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was routinely maintained in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen), 3 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. In experiments assessing the effects of androgens, FCS was pretreated with dextran-coated charcoal (CT-FCS) (10Leake R.E. Freshney R.I. Munir I. Steroid Hormones: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D.C.1987: 213-214Google Scholar) to reduce the background levels of steroids. The synthetic androgen R1881 (methyl-trienolone) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, dissolved in absolute ethanol, and added to the cultures from a 1000-fold concentrated stock. Control cultures received similar amounts of ethanol only. Final ethanol concentrations did not exceed 0.1% (v/v). Luciferase Reporter Plasmids—The pGL3-SCAP construct was generated by cloning an approximately 1.1-kb promoter fragment of the SCAP gene (bp -1018 to + 42) (11Nakajima T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Inazawa J. Emi M. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The pGL3-SCAPmutSRE construct was made by performing site-directed mutagenesis using the primer pair 5′-ctgtggcctcgacctcccgggagacttgtgcactcctacctcagcctcctgag-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ctcaggaggctgaggtaggagtgcacaagtctcccgggaggtcgaggccacag-3′ (reverse primer). To obtain the entire genomic sequence of SCAP, a human PAC genomic library was screened by PCR (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA) using both a primer pair targeted at the promoter region of the SCAP gene (designated SCAP promoter) (bp -452 to -173) (11Nakajima T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Inazawa J. Emi M. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and a primer pair amplifying a genomic region encompassing exon 22 (designated SCAP exon 22) (bp 3475–3588; GenBank™ accession number D83782) (Table I). A positive clone, designated PAC-SCAP, was grown according to the supplier's recommendations. PAC-SCAP DNA was purified using a Qiagen plasmid kit (very low copy plasmid purification protocol). KpnI restriction fragments derived from PAC-SCAP and subfragments thereof were cloned into the pGL3 promoter vector or into a vector driven by a minimal promoter (pE1bLUC) (12Sui X. Bramlett K.S. Jorge M.C. Swanson D.A. von Eschenbach A.C. Jenster G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9449-9454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Following a NCBI human genomic BLAST search, the location and orientation of the genomic DNA fragments were determined in relation to the sequence of the SCAP gene. The oligonucleotides used in band shift assays (see below) were hybridized and cloned into a NheI-digested pES vector (a pGL3-derived plasmid driven by a thymidine kinase-TATA minimal promoter), resulting in the insertion of two copies of the oligonucleotide with alternating orientation upstream of the minimal TATA box. The genomic inserts of all constructs were subjected to nucleotide sequencing using an automated laser fluorescence sequencer (Amersham Biosciences).Table IPrimers used to screen a human PAC genomic library for the genomic sequence of SCAPDNA amplifiedPrimer pairPrimer sequencePCR productsbpSCAP promoter5′gagacggaggtctcctacgttg2793′catgcgtagtcgaaccacattcSCAP exon 225′tggggatgtcacctcccttac1133′tgctgaatggagtagaacttgatgc Open table in a new tab Transient Transfections—LNCaP cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% CT-FCS. The next day, transfection mixtures were prepared. For each dish, 2 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) was supplemented with 3 μg of promoter-reporter construct. In case of cotransfection experiments, 100 ng of an expression construct encoding the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was added. After the addition of 9 μl of Transfast (Promega), the transfection mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with serum-free medium, the transfection mixture was added, and the cell cultures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Four ml of RPMI medium with 5% CT-FCS was added. The next day, the medium was replaced (RPMI with 5% CT-FCS), and the cells were treated with 10-8m R1881, 10-8m dexamethasone, or ethanol vehicle for 2 days. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Aliquots of 10 μl of cleared lysate were assayed for luciferase activity by using a luciferase reporter assay kit from Promega and a Berthold Microlumat LB96P luminometer. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-tagged AR-DBD or GR-DBD was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS from pGEX-2TK plasmid as described (13Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and was purified on immobilized glutathione (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All oligonucleotides used in the band shift assays contain XhoI and NheI overhanging ends. Oligonucleotides were hybridized and 5′ overhanging ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Labeled oligonucleotide dimer (20,000 cpm, ∼5–10 fmol) was incubated with recombinant AR-DBD (or GR-DBD) in a solution containing 10 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 8.5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 ng/μl poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min on ice. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 22 mm Tris, 22 mm borate, 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.05% Triton X-100 at room temperature. The gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm-MP. In binding assays, a constant amount of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm, corresponding to 5–10 fmol) was incubated with increasing amounts of receptor DBD. The percentage of radioactivity that was retarded by dimeric receptor-DBD in each lane of the gel, relative to the total amount of radioactivity in that lane was plotted against the AR-DBD or GR-DBD concentration that was used. The radioactive signals were quantitated using PhosphorImager screens (Amersham Biosciences). To calculate the apparent dissociation constant (Ks), the Sigma Plot software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used. The best fits were calculated to four parameter curves with allosteric Hill kinetics. A 1.1-kb Proximal SCAP Promoter Fragment Does Not Harbor Androgen-responsive Region(s)—The human SCAP gene is located on chromosome 3 (3p21.3) and consists of 23 exons and 22 introns (11Nakajima T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Inazawa J. Emi M. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At the start of our investigations, only the coding sequence of the SCAP gene and the nucleotide sequence of a DNA region of ∼1.1 kb located in the 5′ region flanking the start of transcription of the SCAP gene were available (11Nakajima T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Inazawa J. Emi M. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a search for potential androgen-responsive domains, the 1.1-kb promoter region was cloned into the pGL3 basic vector. LNCaP cells transiently transfected with the resulting promoter-reporter construct were treated with R1881 (10-8m) or ethanol vehicle for 2 days. No significant effects of androgens on reporter gene activity were observed. Neither expansion of this 1.1-kb region to ∼6 kb 5′-upstream nor shortening altered androgen responsiveness. Mutation of a putative SRE described in this region (11Nakajima T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Inazawa J. Emi M. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) markedly reduced overall expression but did not affect androgen regulation (data not shown). Isolation of a 122-bp Androgen-responsive Region within Intron 8 of the SCAP Gene—Because no androgen-regulatory regions were found in the 1.1-kb promoter region, we decided to explore the entire genomic sequence of the gene encoding SCAP for regions mediating the stimulatory effects of androgens. To this end, a human PAC genomic library was screened for the genomic sequence of SCAP by a PCR screening using both a primer set targeted at the promoter region of the SCAP gene and a primer pair amplifying a genomic fragment corresponding to exon 22 (Fig. 1). Positive clones thus isolated (designated PAC-SCAP) contain most of the genomic sequence of the SCAP gene. Genomic fragments obtained by restriction enzyme digestion of DNA isolated from the resulting PAC-SCAP clone and covering ∼70% of the SCAP gene were individually cloned into the enhancer site of the pGL3 promoter vector, which is driven by an SV40 promoter. Following automated laser fluorescence sequencing of the genomic inserts and using the NCBI human genomic blast search program, the locations of the genomic DNA fragments in the SCAP gene were determined. Upon transient transfection into LNCaP cells, several of these constructs showed a slight and often poorly reproducible increase in reporter activity after androgen exposure. In most cases, the extent to which reporter gene activity was induced barely exceeded the induction observed with the empty pGL3 promoter-reporter vector (≈1.2-fold; data not shown). One promoter-reporter construct (designated SCAP-X), however, harboring a 4.5-kb genomic insert located in a region of the SCAP gene encompassing exons 8–10, consistently displayed a 2–3-fold induction of reporter activity after androgen exposure (Fig. 2). This construct was selected for further analysis. By restriction enzyme digestion the genomic DNA insert of SCAP-X was divided into three independent fragments that were individually cloned into pGL3. As shown in Fig. 2B, only one of the three resulting promoter-reporter constructs (designated SCAP-X3) responded to androgen exposure with a major (≈3-fold) increase in reporter activity, suggesting the presence of (an) androgen-responsive region(s) within this DNA segment (Fig. 2B). To more precisely locate the androgen-responsive region(s) within this 2.3-kb DNA fragment located in a genomic region encompassing exon 9, the DNA insert of SCAP-X3 was subjected to deletions. Transient transfection experiments using the deletion constructs indicated the presence of an androgen-responsive domain within a 122-bp DNA fragment located in intron 8 of the gene encoding SCAP (construct SCAP-122bp). Androgen treatment of transiently transfected LNCaP cells gave rise to an ∼2.3-fold increase in SCAP-122bp reporter gene activity (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, introduction of this 122-bp fragment into the enhancer site of a reporter construct driven by a minimal promoter containing only a TATA box (pE1bluc-SCAP-122bp) (12Sui X. Bramlett K.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9449-9454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) yielded a 9.3 ± 3.1-fold (n = 3) induction of reporter gene activity, confirming the presence of an androgen response domain within the tested DNA fragment. Identification of an AR-binding Site within Intron 8 of the SCAP Gene—To explore whether the androgen stimulation of SCAP-122bp reporter gene activity is mediated by a direct interaction between the 122-bp genomic DNA fragment and the AR, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were set up using recombinant AR-DBD protein and radiolabeled probes corresponding to DNA fragments encompassing approximately one-third of the original 122-bp fragment (designated oligonucleotide SCAP 1, 2, and 3; see Fig. 3A). To avoid inadvertent disruption of any region(s) mediating androgen effects, these oligonucleotides were designed to contain a 8-bp overlap with their neighboring DNA fragments. As shown in Fig. 3B, a shifted DNA-protein complex was observed when AR-DBD was added to oligonucleotide SCAP 2. In contrast, the AR-DBD displayed no or very weak interaction with either oligonucleotide SCAP 1 or oligonucleotide SCAP 3. To evaluate whether the observed binding of AR-DBD to oligonucleotide SCAP 2 can indeed give rise to transcriptional activation of the SCAP gene, two copies of each oligonucleotide (oligonucleotides 1–3) were cloned in a luciferase vector upstream of the heterologous thymidine kinase minimal promoter (pES vector), and the androgen responsiveness of the resulting promoter-reporter constructs was evaluated in transient transfection assays in LNCaP cells. A marked increase in the reporter activity of pES-oligoSCAP2 was observed following androgen treatment, indicating that the interaction between AR-DBD and oligonucleotide SCAP 2 is indeed functionally relevant (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the findings described in Fig. 3B, the androgen induction of reporter activity of pES-oligoSCAP 1 and 3 constructs was marginal. Characterization of the AR-binding Site within Intron 8 of the SCAP Gene—To determine the exact site of AR-DNA interaction within oligonucleotide SCAP 2, the nucleotide sequence of oligonucleotide SCAP 2 (Fig. 3A) was analyzed in more detail. This analysis revealed the presence of a TGTACC sequence that bares resemblance to the consensus ARE core-binding motif TGTTCT. Because an ARE typically consists of a three-nucleotide-spaced inverted repeat of a 5′-TGTTCT-3′-like monomer-binding motif (14Verrijdt G. Haelens A. Claessens F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the GGAAGAaaaTGTACC sequence within oligonucleotide SCAP 2 might represent a novel ARE. To test this hypothesis, an oligonucleotide corresponding to this particular sequence (aagaGGAAGAaaaTGTACCtctt, designated oligonucleotide 2s for oligonucleotide SCAP 2 short) was generated and used in gel shift assays (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, a shifted AR-DBD-DNA complex was observed when oligonucleotide 2s was used in EMSA studies, indicating that the oligonucleotide 2s sequence is indeed sufficient for AR dimer binding. Substitution of the guanine residue within the TGTACC motif, which is a unique and consistent feature of AREs (14Verrijdt G. Haelens A. Claessens F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), by a thymine (TGTACC → TTTACC) (oligonucleotide 2s mut) almost completely prevented binding of AR-DBD. Moreover, deletion of the entire TGTACC right half-site (oligonucleotide 2s del) abolished AR-DBD binding (Fig. 4B). Conversely, deleting the GGAAGA left half-site or mutation of this site (GGAAGA → CGAAGA) gave rise to an altered AR-DBD binding pattern, suggesting a shift from dimer to monomer binding (data not shown). In addition, an excess of unlabeled homologous competitor fragment displaced AR-DBD binding to labeled oligonucleotide 2s DNA. Oligonucleotides in which the guanine residue within the TGTACC sequence was mutated into a thymine as well as oligonucleotides lacking the entire TGTACC site were unable to compete for AR-DBD binding (Fig. 4C). In contrast, inclusion of an excess of DNA fragments encompassing a well described ARE (rTAT-GRE) (15Jantzen H.M. Strahle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) displaced binding of the AR-DBD to oligonucleotide 2s (data not shown). The addition of oligonucleotides harboring no androgen-responsive regions did not affect AR-DBD binding (data not shown). Interestingly, the binding patterns of AR-DBD to wild type or mutated 2s oligonucleotides reflected the ability of the tested sequences to confer transcriptional activation to reporter genes; reporter gene activity of a construct containing two copies of intact oligonucleotide 2s markedly (7-fold) increased following androgen treatment, whereas mutation or deletion of the TGTACC sequence (almost) completely prevented such an increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 4D). In addition, the deranged AR-DBD binding to mutated oligonucleotide 2s left half-site sequences reflected the diminished ability of these sequences to confer androgen responsiveness to reporter genes (data not shown). To further characterize binding of the AR-DBD to the newly identified SCAP ARE, binding studies were set up, and an apparent dissociation constant (Ks) was deduced. To this end, radiolabeled 2s oligonucleotides were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant AR-DBD (4.23–1692 nm). A binding curve was generated, and a best fit was calculated to a plot with four-parameter Hill kinetics. Binding of AR-DBD to oligonucleotide 2s is sigmoidal, the plateau of 95% of total binding is reached at ≈630 nm of protein and a Ks of 151 nm (127 and 176 nm, respectively, in two independent experiments using two different preparations of AR-DBD) was deduced (Fig. 4E). Taken together, the data presented in Fig. 4 provide evidence for the existence of a novel ARE located within intron 8 of the SCAP gene (SCAP ARE). To further explore the importance of this particular sequence for the androgen induction of SCAP gene expression, we evaluated the impact of the presence of this sequence on androgen stimulation of SCAP-122bp reporter gene activity. As shown in Fig. 5, androgen stimulation of LNCaP cells transiently transfected with the wild type pE1bluc-SCAP-122bp construct gave rise to an ∼8-fold induction of reporter gene activity. Mutation (TGTACC → TTTACC) or deletion (TGTACC sequence) of the SCAP ARE markedly decreased the response, indicating the importance of the presence of the intact SCAP ARE for the androgen-induction of gene transcription. SCAP ARE Represents a Non-AR-specific Regulatory DNA Region—As a final part of our studies, we investigated whether the SCAP gene ARE can be activated also by other class I steroid hormone receptors or belongs to a subset of AREs that selectively bind the AR (14Verrijdt G. Haelens A. Claessens F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether the GR, known to bind several AREs (Ref. 14Verrijdt G. Haelens A. Claessens F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar and references therein), is able to interact with the SCAP gene ARE. EMSA studies using recombinant GR-DBD and the oligonucleotides described in Fig. 4 demonstrated GR binding to oligonucleotide 2s. As was the case for the AR-DBD, mutation or deletion of the TGTACC sequence within this sequence abolished GR-DBD binding (Fig. 6A). In addition, the presence of an intact GGAAGA left half-site was required to obtain normal binding of GR-DBD to oligonucleotide 2s (data not shown). Moreover, an excess of wild type oligonucleotide was able to compete for GR-DBD binding, whereas addition of oligonucleotide 2s mut or oligonucleotide 2s del did not affect binding (Fig. 6B). To examine the functional significance of GR-DNA binding, LNCaP cells, which do not express an endogenous GR, were cotransfected with an expression construct encoding the human GR and promoter-reporter constructs containing two copies of wild type or mutated oligonucleotide 2s oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 6C, exposure to dexamethasone stimulated reporter gene activity of the intact construct. Consistent with the binding pattern observed in Fig. 6A, mutation or deletion of the SCAP ARE right half-site within this construct resulted in a loss of glucocorticoid responsiveness. Similar results were obtained by disruption of the GGAAGA sequence within oligonucleotide 2s (data not shown). Binding studies revealed that binding of GR to oligonucleotide 2s reaches a plateau (∼90% of total binding) at a GR-DBD concentration of ≈880 nm. However, GR-DBD interacted with the SCAP ARE at a somewhat lower affinity than AR-DBD; a Ks of 294 nm was calculated (306 and 282 nm, respectively, in two independent experiments using two different preparations of GR-DBD (Fig. 6D). In previous studies we demonstrated that the marked and coordinated up-regulation of lipogenic genes provoked by androgens in androgen-responsive prostate tumor cells is the result of activation of the SREBP pathway (8Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, using two independent tumor lines we presented evidence that this activation was caused by an androgen-induced increase in the expression of SCAP resulting in an imbalance between SREBP and its retention proteins, translocation of the SREBP·SCAP complex to the Golgi apparatus and proteolytic activation of SREBP (9Heemers H. Maes B. Foufelle F. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present paper we searched for regions in the SCAP gene that might mediate androgen-induced transcription either by direct interaction with the AR or through a more indirect mechanism. Original attempts to identify androgen-responsive regions in the SCAP promoter using promoter-reporter constructs containing either 1.1 or 6 kb of the 5′-upstream region of the SCAP gene failed. Like many other components of the SREBP signaling cascade, the SCAP promoter contains a (putative) SRE (11Nakajima T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Inazawa J. Emi M. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Destruction of this SRE strongly reduced basal activity, but no evidence was found for its involvement in the effects of androgens on SCAP induction (data not shown). In view of these findings a PAC clone harboring the complete human SCAP gene sequence was isolated, and a more systematic search for regions able to mediate androgen responsiveness was performed. Genomic fragments of the SCAP-PAC clone were individually subcloned into the enhancer site of the pGL3 promoter vector, driven by a SV40 promoter. In this way ∼70% of the entire gene could be investigated. For the remainder 30% subcloning in the pGL3 vector failed. Transient transfection studies in LNCaP cells pointed to a 4.5-kb region encompassing exons 8–10 as an androgen-responsive region consistently yielding a 3-fold stimulation in reporter expression. By further digestion, the active region could be pinned down to a 122-bp fragment yielding a 9.3-fold stimulation when subcloned in the enhancer of a reporter construct driven by a minimal promoter containing only a TATA box (pE1bluc). This responsive region displays a number of interesting characteristics. 1) It is located in an intron (intron 8) of the SCAP gene. Intronic localization of androgen-responsive regions has also been reported for the genes encoding the C1 and C3 components of prostatic binding protein (16Claessens F. Celis L. Peeters B. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Claessens F. Celis L. De Vos P. Peeters B. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and for the gene encoding β-glucuronidase (18Lund S.D. Gallagher P.M. Wang B. Porter S.C. Ganshaw R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5426-5434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) Gel retardation studies reveal that the relevant 122-bp fragment interacts directly with the AR, suggesting that it may contain an ARE. 3) Further analysis reveals the presence of a sequence aagaGGAAGAaaaTGTACCtctt that bears resemblance to the 5′-TGTTCT-3′ consensus core-binding motif of canonical AREs. This short sequence (SCAP 2s) binds the AR-DBD and is able to confer androgen responsiveness to promoter reporter constructs when transfected in LNCaP. Moreover, mutations of bases considered critical for the function of an ARE or deletions of the GGAAGA left half of the proposed ARE reduce both binding and activity. The same mutations and deletions also destroyed the ability of the 122-bp fragment to act as an ARE. 4) Because AREs can be divided in at least two categories, the classical AREs, which apart from the AR also bind other class 1 steroid hormone receptors and which are organized as (imperfect) inverted repeats, and the “specific AREs” which selectively recognize the AR and are structured as partial direct repeats (14Verrijdt G. Haelens A. Claessens F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we also studied the ability of SCAP 2s to act as a GRE. The data summarized in Fig. 6 indicate that SCAP 2s behaves as a classical ARE and binds the GR-DBD with an affinity that is only slightly lower than that observed for the AR-DBD (Ks = ∼300 nm versus ∼150 nm for AR binding). Taken together, these data support the contention that SCAP is a direct target for androgen action and that androgen-induced increases in SCAP expression are at least in part the result of a direct interaction of the AR with an ARE located in intron 8 of the SCAP gene. At this stage, it cannot be excluded that additional elements may contribute to the androgen-induced lipogenesis in prostate tumor cells. Although SCAP is a pivotal element in the control of SREBP signaling, many elements in this signaling pathway remain incompletely understood and may turn out to be additional targets for androgen action. Similarly, because we could study only 70% of the sequences of the SCAP gene, the existence of additional AREs in some of the uninvestigated domains of the gene cannot be excluded. Another intriguing observation is that stable introduction of the AR in the otherwise androgen-unresponsive context of PC3 prostate cancer cells failed to evoke a full androgen response of the SCAP gene (data not shown). This may point to the requirement of other (cis-acting, epigenetic, etc.) factors in addition to the AR to mediate the SCAP response to androgens. The finding of an ARE in the SCAP gene may not only be relevant to androgen-induced lipogenesis in prostate tumor cells. In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that androgens also provoke a coordinated activation of lipogenic pathways involved in cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis in noncancerous target tissues such as the rat prostate and lacrimal gland (19Heemers H. Vanderhoydonc F. Roskams T. Shechter I. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 205: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and in hamster sebaceous glands (20Rosignoli C. Nicolas J.C. Jomard A. Michel S. Exp. Dermatol. 2003; 12: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the rat prostate this increase in lipogenesis was shown to be accompanied by activation of the SREBP pathway (19Heemers H. Vanderhoydonc F. Roskams T. Shechter I. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 205: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and SCAP was demonstrated to be an androgen-inducible gene (21Jiang F. Wang Z. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, steroid induced lipogenesis has also been observed in mammary tumor cells (22Judge S.M. Chatterton R.T. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4407-4412PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chambon M. Rochefort H. Vial H.J. Chabos D. J. Steroid. Biochem. 1989; 33: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this case progestagens are the most active inducers, and at least in some cell lines induction seems to be mediated by SREBPs (24Lacasa D. Le Liepvre X. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11512-11516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Given the fact that the ARE identified in the SCAP gene belongs to the family of nonselective response elements for steroid receptors of class 1, it is tempting to speculate that here too SCAP may turn out to be a direct target for steroid action."
https://openalex.org/W2043923768,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are accompanied by the accumulation of a pathologic isoform of a host-encoded protein, termed prion protein (PrP). Despite the widespread distribution of the cellular isoform of PrP (protease-sensitive PrP; PrP-sen), the disease-associated isoform (protease-resistant PrP; PrP-res) appears to be primarily restricted to cells of the nervous and lymphoreticular systems. In order to study why scrapie infection appears to be restricted to certain cells, we followed acute and persistent PrP-res formation upon exposure of cells to different scrapie agents. We found that, independent of the cell type and scrapie strain, initial PrP-res formation occurred rapidly in cells. However, sustained generation of PrP-res and persistent infection did not necessarily follow acute PrP-res formation. Persistent PrP-res formation and scrapie infection was restricted to one cell line inoculated with the mouse scrapie strain 22L. In contrast to cells that did not become scrapie-infected, the level of PrP-res in the 22L-infected cells rapidly increased in the absence of a concomitant increase in the number of PrP-res-producing cells. Furthermore, the protein banding pattern of PrP-res in these cells changed over time as the cells became chronically infected. Thus, our results suggest that the events leading to the initial formation of PrP-res may differ from those required for sustained PrP-res formation and infection. This may, at least in part, explain the observation that not all PrP-sen-expressing cells appear to support transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agent replication. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are accompanied by the accumulation of a pathologic isoform of a host-encoded protein, termed prion protein (PrP). Despite the widespread distribution of the cellular isoform of PrP (protease-sensitive PrP; PrP-sen), the disease-associated isoform (protease-resistant PrP; PrP-res) appears to be primarily restricted to cells of the nervous and lymphoreticular systems.

This may, at least in part, explain the observation that not all PrP-sen-expressing cells appear to support transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agent replication. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) 1The abbreviations used are: TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy; BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PrP, prion protein; PrP-sen, protease-sensitive PrP; PrP-res, protease-resistant PrP; IC, intracranially; PK, Proteinase K; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. are progressive neurodegenerative diseases that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straüssler-Scheinker syndrome, and Kuru in humans as well as scrapie in sheep and goats, chronic wasting disease in mule deer and elk, transmissible mink encephalopathy, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). A prerequisite for TSE infection is the expression of the protease-sensitive host prion protein (PrP-sen) (1Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). PrP-sen is a highly conserved mammalian sialoglycoprotein of unknown function that is anchored to the cell membrane by a phosphatidylinositol moiety (2Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T. Groth D. Tarentino A. Borchelt D.R. Teplow D. Hood L. Burlingame A. Lycke E. Kobata A. Prusiner S.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 3Bendheim P.E. Potempska A. Kascsak R.J. Bolton D.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 158: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). During TSE infection, PrP-sen is converted to its partially protease-resistant, pathologic isoform PrP-res. This abnormal form of PrP is closely associated with TSE infectivity and has been proposed as the protein-only agent responsible for TSE diseases (4Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4121) Google Scholar). PrP-sen is required for susceptibility to TSE disease (1Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, however, it is unlikely that PrP-sen expression is the sole prerequisite for TSE infection. PrP-sen is expressed in a wide variety of tissues (5Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M.

Virol. 1991; 65: 6292-6295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy in PrP-sen expression and PrP-res formation is unknown. However, the fact that different scrapie strains induce PrP-res formation in different brain areas suggests that PrP-res formation is both cell type- and scrapie strain-dependent (10Hecker R.

Evidence for scrapie strain-dependent PrP-res formation and infection also comes from infection studies with tissue culture cells, which demonstrate that the same cell line is susceptible to some scrapie strains but not to others (14Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A. Arlotto M. Casanova D. Riondel J. Favier A. Lehmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One possible explanation for the inability of TSE strains to persistently infect specific cell populations may be that these cells cannot support the formation of new PrP-res induced by these strains. However, attempts to study the very early events in cell culture leading to PrP-res formation have been difficult, since 1) only a few cell culture systems have been identified that appear to be susceptible to the scrapie agent, 2) newly formed PrP-res must be discriminated from PrP-res present in the inoculum, and 3) the amount of PrP-res produced in susceptible cell lines is often relatively low. In this study, we have used cell culture systems that allow us to follow PrP-res formation following exposure of the cells to scrapie-infected brain homogenates (18Korth C. Kaneko K. Prusiner S.B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Vorberg I. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36775-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have found that PrP-res is detectable within 24 h of exposure to mouse scrapie agents. This rapid formation of PrP-res was scrapie strain-independent and could be initiated in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells. However, acute formation of PrP-res was not always indicative of a persistent scrapie infection. Only fibroblast cells that had been exposed to the mouse scrapie strain 22L persistently produced PrP-res and infectivity. Quantitative and qualitative changes in newly formed PrP-res accompanied the establishment of a persistent infection and could be indicative of the scrapie agent localizing to a cellular compartment suitable for efficient PrP-res formation. Thus, our data suggest that whereas acute formation of PrP-res may occur in a variety of cell types, initiation of persistent PrP-res formation and scrapie infection requires additional cell- and/or scrapie strain-specific factors for the scrapie agent to adapt to and persistently infect a cell. Cell Lines—The mouse neuroblastoma cell line Mo3F4-MNB and the mouse fibroblast cell cultures Mo3F4-Ψ2C2 and Mo3F4-Ψ2/PA317 have been described previously (16Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell cultures express high levels of mouse PrP-sen containing the epitope to the hamster PrP-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 (Mo3F4). The 3F4 epitope had previously been inserted into mouse PrP by two amino acid substitutions at positions 108 and 111 (20Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M.

Scrapie Strains and Preparation of Inocula—The mouse-adapted scrapie strains ME7, 87V, and 22L were the kind gift of Dr. James Hope (Lasswade Veterinary Laboratory, Penicuik, Midlothian, UK) and were passaged in C57Bl/10 (ME7, 22L) or VmDk (87V) mice. Scrapie strain RML was passaged in RML mice. Brain homogenates were prepared in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (10%, w/v) using the brains of terminally sick animals. Brain tissue was homogenized and sonicated for 5 min. Cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 2000 × g), and the resultant brain homogenates were stored at –70 °C. For cell inoculation, brain homogenate was diluted into Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and sonicated for 2 min prior to use. The level of PrP-res and infectivity present in the brain homogenates used were similar for each strain. The titers of the different strains used were based upon the amount of inoculum needed to infect 50% of animals that had been injected intracranially (IC) with an infected brain homogenate (ID50). In C57Bl/10 mice, ME7 had an IC ID50 of 2.2 × 107.9 infectious units/g of brain tissue, whereas 22L had an IC ID50 of 2 × 108.8 infectious units/gram of brain tissue. Scrapie strain RML had an IC ID50 of 3.3 × 107.8 infectious units/gram of brain tissue when titered in RML mice. The titer of 87V in VmDk mice is ongoing. Exposure of Cells to Scrapie Agent and Detection of Newly Formed PrP-res—Experiments were performed in 24-well microtiter plates. Cells (0.5 × 105/well) were overlaid with different dilutions of 10% brain homogenate in Opti-MEM. For kinetics studies, different cell numbers were plated to ensure comparable levels of cells at the time point of harvest (4 h, 4 × 105; 24 h, 4 × 105; 48 h, 2 × 105; 72 h, 1 × 105; 96 h, 0.5 × 105 cells/ml). Kinetic studies performed with the same number of cells plated (0.5 × 105/well) were also done and gave similar results when compared with experiments where different numbers of cells were plated. After 4 h, 400 μl of DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Cells were either directly lysed or incubated for up to 96 h before being lysed in lysis buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation (5 min, room temperature, 16,000 × g). For Mo3F4 PrP-sen detection, one-hundredth of the cell lysate was reserved. In order to detect PrP-res, the remaining cell lysate was incubated with 20 μg/ml Proteinase K (PK) for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 3 mm, and samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were sonicated into sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 3 mm EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and assayed on 14% NOVEX precast gels (Invitrogen). PrP-sen and newly formed PrP-res were detected by Western blot using the mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 and enhanced chemiluminescence or enhanced chemifluorescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of PrP-sen—Confluent monolayers of cells were labeled with trans-[35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously reported (21Raymond G.J. Hope J. Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond L.D. Bossers A. Ironside J. Will R.G. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Rubenstein R. Smits M.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1997; 388: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered balanced salt solution and incubated in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM for 1 h. Trans-[35S]methionine/cysteine was added to a final concentration of 15 μCi, and cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Monolayers were lysed, and cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 2000 × g). Proteins were precipitated in 4 volumes of methanol and sonicated into detergent lipid protein complex buffer (4.2 mg of l-α-phosphatidylcholine per ml, 123 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% N-lauroylsarcosine). Samples were divided into two fractions, and PrP-sen was immunoprecipitated with either the polyclonal antiserum R30 to detect total PrP or the monoclonal antibody 3F4 to detect epitope-tagged PrP. Proteins were separated on 14% NOVEX Precast gels (Invitrogen), and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Detection of Scrapie Infectivity in Cell Cultures Exposed to Scrapie Agent—Following exposure to brain homogenate, cells were continuously cultured and harvested for inoculation at passage 12 or 13 postinfection. Cells were resuspended in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Following five consecutive cycles of freeze/thawing, lysates were sonicated, and ∼5 × 105 cells/mouse were inoculated IC into C57Bl/10 weanling mice. Since the scrapie strain 87V had been propagated in VmDk mice, lysates prepared from cells exposed to 87V brain homogenate were inoculated into VmDk mice. The mouse scrapie strain 87V has an incubation time of >700 days in C57Bl/10 mice but a shorter incubation time in VmDk mice, which express a mouse PrP allele that differs from the C57Bl/10 allele at positions 108 and 189 (22Westaway D. Goodman P.A. Mirenda C.A. McKinley M.P. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). As controls, 50 μl of 1% brain homogenates from uninfected mice or mice infected with scrapie strain 87V, RML, 22L, or ME7 were also inoculated IC into the appropriate mouse strain. Mice were observed at least twice a week for the onset of neurological disease, and mice showing signs of scrapie disease were sacrificed. All animal experiments were approved by the Rocky Mountain Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories are fully accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Care. Determination of the Number of PrP-res-accumulating Cells—To determine the number of cells accumulating PrP-res upon infection with scrapie strain 22L, Mo3F4-Ψ2C2 cells were exposed to 1% 22L scrapie brain homogenate in 24-well plates. Cells from three wells were pooled and cloned by limiting dilution after 48, 72, or 96 h of exposure. Additionally, cells were exposed for 96 h to scrapie brain homogenate and then continuously passaged in the absence of brain homogenate. After five and 10 passages, these cells were also cloned. Single cell clones were expanded, and cell lysates of clones were tested for their PrP-res content as described above. Statistical analysis of the resulting data was done using the χ2 test. Acute PrP-res Formation following Exposure of Neuroblastoma and Fibroblast Cells to Different Scrapie Strains—In order to study the early events that occur during infection with a TSE agent, we have used a cellular assay to detect newly formed, fully glycosylated PrP-res (19Vorberg I. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36775-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This assay utilizes a cloned mouse neuroblastoma cell line (Mo3F4-MNB) that produces high levels of mouse 3F4-positive PrP-sen when compared with the endogenous mouse PrP-sen expressed in these cells (Fig. 1A). New PrP-res derived from mouse 3F4-positive PrP-sen can be distinguished from the PrP-res present in the infectious inoculum by simple Western blot analysis using the mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 (18Korth C. Kaneko K. Prusiner S.B. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Vorberg I. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36775-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to different dilutions of RML scrapie brain homogenate for 4 days, Mo3F4-MNB cells produced 3F4-positive PrP-res in a brain homogenate concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). By contrast, no PrP-res was present in cells exposed to normal brain homogenate (Fig. 1B, Mock). Furthermore, 3F4-positive PrP-res was also generated in Mo3F4-MNB cells upon exposure to scrapie strains 22L, ME7, and 87V (Fig. 1C) (19Vorberg I. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36775-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate that new (i.e. acute) formation of PrP-res in neuroblastoma cells can be driven by multiple scrapie strains. Whereas the presence of PrP-res in the lymphoreticular tissues of infected mice can vary between scrapie strains, PrP-res is almost always found within the central nervous system, and neuronal vaculation (i.e. spongiform change) is a central hallmark of TSE diseases. As a result, it is often assumed that it is primarily cells within the central nervous system that accumulate PrP-res and are susceptible to scrapie infection. To test whether acute PrP-res formation could also be detected in nonneuronal cells following exposure to different scrapie strains, we used a mixture of Ψ2/PA317 fibroblast cells expressing Mo3F4 PrP-sen (Mo3F4-Ψ2/PA317), a cell culture previously shown to be susceptible to 22L scrapie (16Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PrP-res formation was detected in cells exposed to RML, 22L, ME7, and 87V scrapie, although differences in the amount of PrP-res produced were observed (Fig. 1D). The in vivo titers and PrP-res content of the 22L, ME7, and RML scrapie brain homogenates used were similar (see “Experimental Procedures”), suggesting that significant differences in scrapie agent titer or input PrP-res cannot explain the observed differences in the amount of new PrP-res formed. Therefore, acute PrP-res is formed upon exposure to different scrapie strains and can be initiated in cells of both neuronal and nonneuronal origin. Acute PrP-res Formation Does Not Always Lead to Sustained PrP-res Formation—To test whether acute PrP-res formation led to persistent PrP-res formation, Mo3F4-MNB and Mo3F4-Ψ2/PA317 cells were exposed to mouse scrapie infectivity and continuously passaged. In subsequent passages (passages 1–13) of Mo3F4-MNB cells inoculated with any of the scrapie strains, no 3F4-positive PrP-res was detected. Multiple passages of Mo3F4-Ψ2/PA317 cells exposed to the strain RML, 87V, or ME7 (Fig. 2, A and B) (data not shown) were also negative for 3F4-positive PrP-res. However, as reported previously (16Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), Mo3F4-Ψ2/PA317 fibroblasts inoculated with 22L brain homogenate accumulated high levels of 3F4-positive PrP-res upon continuous passage (Fig. 2B). Thus, whereas multiple scrapie strains could initiate PrP-res formation in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells, detectable PrP-res formation was not sustained in these cultures except for fibroblast cells exposed to the scrapie strain 22L. These data suggest that the requirements for sustained PrP-res formation are both cell type- and scrapie strain-dependent. Acute PrP-res Formation Does Not Always Lead to Infection—Previous studies have demonstrated that cell cultures that do not accumulate detectable levels of PrP-res upon exposure to TSE agent can still propagate scrapie infectivity (23Race R.E. Fadness L.H. Chesebro B. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether mouse neuroblastoma cells or mouse fibroblast cells exposed to different scrapie strains generated scrapie infectivity, cell lysates from cells passaged at least 12 times in vitro were inoculated intracranially into either C57Bl/10 (cells exposed to scrapie strain RML, 22L, or ME7) or VmDk mice (cells exposed to scrapie strain 87V) (Table I). As controls, cells exposed to normal mouse brain homogenate (“None” in Table I) as well as brain homogenates from scrapie-infected or uninfected mice were also inoculated.Table IInoculation of C57BL/10 mice and VmDk mice with cells exposed to different scrapie strainsScrapie strainInoculum (brain homogenate or cell lysate)MiceClinical scrapie/TotalIncubation time ± S.E.NoneBrain homogenateC57Bl/100/6>755Mo3F4-MNB0/5>755Mo3F4-ψ2/PA3170/4>75522LBrain homogenateC57Bl/107/7161.9 ± 3.7Mo3F4-MNB0/6>755Mo3F4-ψ2/PA3178/8284.6 ± 39.6RMLBrain homogenateC57Bl/108/8164.4 ± 3.9Mo3F4-MNB0/4>753Mo3F4-ψ2/PA3171/7624,aOne mouse that died 624 days postinfection was positive for PrP-res.

All other nonclinical mice sacrificed up to 755 days postinfection were negative for PrP-res. Open table in a new tab Whereas mice inoculated with 22L-infected fibroblast cells succumbed to disease within 284.6 ± 39.6 days, mice inoculated with neuroblastoma cells exposed to the 22L scrapie strain did not show any signs of scrapie up to >755 days postinfection (Table I). Furthermore, mice inoculated with either neuroblastoma cells or fibroblast cells exposed to ME7, RML, or 87V mouse scrapie did not display any signs of disease. The brains of all nonclinical animals sacrificed up to 755 days postinfection (when the experiment was terminated) were analyzed for PrP-res. All were negative except for one mouse inoculated with fibroblast cells exposed to RML scrapie that accumulated PrP-res in the brain 624 days postinoculation (Table I). This suggests that a very low amount of RML infectivity (<1 ID /5 × 10550 cells) was present in the cell culture. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that whereas mouse neuroblastoma cells and mouse fibroblasts were capable of forming detectable PrP-res upon acute exposure to scrapie brain homogenate, this did not lead to persistent infection in most cases. These data suggest that the cellular requirements for acute PrP-res formation may differ from those for sustained PrP-res formation and persistent scrapie infection. Acute PrP-res Formation Is Cell-associated and Requires Intact Cells—The foregoing results demonstrated that acute PrP-res formation could be initiated in two different cell types by multiple scrapie strains, but persistent infection did not necessarily occur. One possible explanation for these results is that de novo PrP-res formation was not cell-associated. PrP-res formation can occur in vitro without the context of a living cell (24Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 25Soto C. Saborio G.P. Anderes L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 390-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and a recent study suggested that removal of PrP-sen from the cell membrane facilitates new PrP-res formation (26Baron G.S. Wehrly K. Dorward D.W. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that newly formed PrP-res was being generated solely from the conversion of secreted or non-cell-associated Mo3F4 PrP-sen present in the cell medium. To confirm that the newly formed PrP-res detected was cell-associated, Mo3F4-MNB culture supernatant was harvested after 96 h of incubation with brain homogenate from a mouse infected with the mouse scrapie strain ME7, and the supernatant as well as the cell lysate was checked for 3F4-positive PrP-res. Newly formed PrP-res was detectable in the cell lysate but not in the cell culture supernatant (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that the de novo PrP-res produced in this assay was cell-associated. To study whether PrP-res formation was dependent upon intact cells, Mo3F4-MNB cells were sonicated to rupture the cell membranes and mixed with brain homogenate in cell culture medium supplemented with protease inhibitors. No 3F4-positive PrP-res could be detected in samples containing either normal brain homogenate or brain homogenate from a scrapie-infected animal (Fig. 3B). These experiments are in agreement with previously published data, demonstrating that in vitro PrP-res formation driven by crude TSE brain homogenates is dependent on the presence of detergent (19Vorberg I. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36775-36781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Soto C. Saborio G.P. Anderes L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 390-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These results show that newly formed PrP-res is cell-associated and that its formation is dependent upon intact cells. Thus, the inability to establish a persistent infection in these cells was not due to the lack of cell-associated PrP-res formation. Acute PrP-res Formation Is a Rapid Process—The fact that de novo PrP-res formation was easily detectable just 96 h after exposure of uninfected cells to scrapie brain homogenate suggested that PrP-res formation was occurring rapidly in these cells. To determine how rapidly PrP-res was generated, Mo3F4-MNB cells were exposed for different time periods to scrapie strains known to replicate with either long (87V) or short (RML) incubation periods in C57Bl/10 mice (27Bruce M.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1993; 49: 822-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Maximum levels of 3F4-positive PrP-res were reached after 24 h of inoculation with either RML or 87V scrapie brain homogenates (Fig. 4). Interestingly, de novo formation of PrP-res was rapid regardless of whether the PrP-res in the infected brain homogenate was derived from a short or long incubation time strain. These data are consistent with recent data using hamster scrapie demonstrating that, regardless of the strain incubation time, the same amount of PrP-res is formed after 24 h (28Mulcahy E.R. Bessen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1643-1649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, our results demonstrate that the acute formation of PrP-res followi"
https://openalex.org/W2017560111,"The mammalian Runx gene family (Runx1–3) are transcription factors that play essential, lineage-specific roles in development. A growing body of evidence implicates these genes as mutational targets in cancer where, in different contexts, individual family members have been reported to act as tumour suppressors, dominant oncogenes or mediators of metastasis. We are exploring these paradoxical observations by ectopic expression of RUNX genes in primary murine embryonic fibroblasts where, in common with a number of other dominant oncogenes, RUNX1 induces senescence-like growth arrest in the presence of an intact p19ARF-p53 pathway. We now report that, in MEFs lacking functional p53, RUNX1 has apparently prooncogenic effects on cell growth that include cytoskeletal reorganization, reduced contact inhibition at confluence and accelerated tumour expansion in vivo. On the other hand, RUNX1 conferred no obvious growth advantage at low cell density and actually delayed entry of primary MEFs into S phase. We also found that ectopic RUNX1 interferes with the morphological and growth responses of p53-null MEFs to TGFβ indicating that these effects are mediated by overlapping pathways. These observations help to elucidate the context-dependent consequences of loss and gain of Runx activity."

PP2B independent dephosphorylation contributes to degradation of c-Fos protein during oxidative stress response of cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes are the major cell type in the heart. Unlike other normal cell types or tumor cells, cardiomyocytes cease to replicate after birth in most mammal species. During cardiac injury, cardiomyocytes can develop hypertrophy to compensate for the loss of cells by necrosis or apoptosis. Enlargement of cardiomyocytes are often observed with various forms of heart disease and have been shown to contribute to heart failure (1Francis G.S. McDonald K. Chu C. Cohn J.N. Am. J. Cardiol. 1995; 75: 11A-16AAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev.

In parallel with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, measurements of oxidative biomarkers have demonstrated an association between oxidative stress and heart failure (6Singh N. Dhalla A.K. Seneviratne C. Singal P.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 147: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 119-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An increase in lipid peroxidation products has been found in heart failure patients and the level of this increase correlates with the severity of heart failure (8Keith M. Geranmayegan A. Sole M.J.

Ischemia and ischemic reperfusion are two major causes of increases in reactive oxygen species. It has been shown that ischemia impairs mitochondrial function and decreases the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, resulting in an increased amount of H2O2 detectable in the ischemic region of the heart (9Shlafer M. Myers C.L. Adkins S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 1195-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Vandeplassche G. Hermans C. Thone F. Borgers M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1989; 21: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unlike ischemia, ischemic reperfusion enhances oxidant generation through abnormal mitochondrial function as well as activated xanthine oxidase, which produces H2O2 when converting hypoxanthine to xanthine. Cell injury in the ischemic area can cause an infiltration of neutrophils, which produce oxidants and cytokines. Certain cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, trigger mitochondrial release of superoxide (11Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of the inflammatory response, there is a further increase in oxidants in the damaged area of the heart. In addition to these traditionally known sources of reactive oxygen species, recent work have found that angiotensin II (AngII) 1The abbreviations used are: AngII, angiotensin II; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ATF, Activating Transcription Factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PP2A, type 2 serine/threonine phosphatase A; CY, cypermethrin; OA, okadic acid; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. and several growth factors can also induce an increase in reactive oxygen species (12Zafari A.M.

Regardless of the abundant sources of oxidants, we have found that H2O2 induces enlargement of cardiomyocytes (15Chen Q. Tu V. Wu Y. Bahl J. Arch. Biochem.

It is commonly known that AngII, endothelin-1, and catecholamines induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via binding to their receptors on the plasma membrane and initiate a cascade of signaling events, including activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPKs (4Chen Q.

These signaling molecules regulate phosphorylation and activation of specific transcription factors, leading to transcriptional activation of a unique set of genes, among which are the atrial natriuretic factor, b-type natriuretic peptide, β myosin heavy chain, ventricular myosin light chain 2, and skeletal α-actin (2Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 3Copper G.T. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Zhu H. Langer G.A. The Myocardium. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 33-80Crossref Google Scholar). AP-1 is a transcription factor thought to play a critical role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. AngII, endothelin-1, and catecholamines have been shown to transiently activate AP-1 transcription factors (22Kudoh S. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Takekoshi N. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Lijnen P. Petrov V. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 949-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). AP-1 transcription factors consist of homodimers of Jun family members (c-Jun, v-Jun, JunB, and JunD), heterodimers of Jun and Fos (c-Fos, v-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2), or heterodimers of Jun and the Activating Transcription factor (ATF2, ATF3/LRF1, B-ATF) (24Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 25Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A number of hypertrophy-associated genes, for example, atrial natriuretic factor, skeletal α-actin, and ventricular myosin light chain 2, contain AP-1 cis-elements in their promoters (26Force T.

A. 1992; 89: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Increased expression of c-Fos and phosphorylation of c-Jun or phosphorylation of ATF-2 all contribute to activation of AP-1. Increased expression of c-Fos may result from activation of Elk-1 transcription factors because of phosphorylation by MAPK family member ERKs (29Babu G.J. Lalli M.J. Sussman M.A. Sadoshima J. Periasamy M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1447-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, c-Jun and ATF-2 have been shown as a substrate for JNKs and p38, respectively (4Chen Q. Tu V. Purdom S. Wood J. Dilley T. Cardiovasc. Tox. 2001; 1: 267-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kudoh S. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Takekoshi N. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Compared with this well defined knowledge for activation of AP-1, the regulatory mechanism for the decay of AP-1 activity has not been well addressed. Like endocrine hypertrophy inducers, H2O2 activates PI3K, p70 S6 kinase, and three branches of MAPKs, i.e. JNKs, p38, and ERKs (30Tu V. Bahl J. Chen Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Tu V. Chen Q. Cardiovasc. Tox. 2003; 3: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A transient activation of AP-1 transcription factors was observed following H2O2 treatment in cardiomyocytes (31Tu V. Chen Q. Cardiovasc. Tox. 2003; 3: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An important component contributing to AP-1 activation by oxidants, as documented in the literature, is elevated expression of the c-fos gene (32Nose K. Shibanuma M. Kikuchi K. Kageyama H. Sakiyama S. Kuroki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 33Li D.W. Spector A. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of post-translational modification of c-Fos protein during oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. This study investigates phosphorylation of c-Fos protein and tests the role of c-Fos phosphorylation in the stability of the protein. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Pharmacological inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cardiomyocyte Isolation and H2O2Treatment—Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat cardiomyocytes (1-2 days old) were isolated following the protocol previously described (15Chen Q. Tu V. Wu Y. Bahl J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Tu V. Bahl J. Chen Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole hearts were removed from 1 to 2-day-old neonates and diced into 1-2-mm pieces after removal of the atria. Heart tissue was then predigested with pancreatin solution containing 0.02% pancreatin and 0.045% collagenase for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded to remove red blood cells. Fresh pancreatin solution was added to heart tissue in 15-min intervals until heart tissues were completely digested. Following pancreatin digestion, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.025% fetuin, 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.17% sodium bicarbonate. Fibroblasts were removed by differential plating after incubating at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1-2hinHam's F-12 medium. Unattached myocytes were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (10% FBS/DMEM). Viable cells were counted after trypan blue staining. Cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes at a density of 3 × 106 viable cells per dish. This protocol yields over 90% myocytes as judged by sarcomeric myosin content (30Tu V. Bahl J. Chen Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following 48 h of culture in DMEM containing 10% FBS, cardiomyocytes were placed in fresh DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for a 48-h incubation. Cells were then treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 10 min. After H2O2 treatment, media was replaced with fresh 0.5% FBS/DMEM to avoid the complication of media oxidation. Cells were incubated for 1-4 h before harvesting for various assays. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA binding assay was performed as previously described (31Tu V. Chen Q. Cardiovasc. Tox. 2003; 3: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 μl of binding buffer (12.5% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and, 4 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 30,000 cpm of 32P-end labeled oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). In supershift experiments, 1 μl of c-Fos antibody (SC number 52X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the nuclear extract in the binding buffer for a 1-h preincubation before addition of radiolabeled probes for a 30-min binding reaction at 4 °C. The oligonucleotides bound to proteins were separated from free probes by electrophoresis using a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried for autoradiography. Immunoblotting—Following H2O2 treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and were harvested in 200 μl of EB lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and freshly added 2 mm DTT, 1 mm Na2VO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method according to the manufacturer's instruction (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE (9 or 7% acrylamide) was performed using 20 μg of protein from cell lysates. Proteins were transferred overnight at 30 volts to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for a minimum of 1 h and then incubated in the primary antibody against c-Fos (rabbit polyclonal, SC number 52X, 1:1650) or ubiquitin (mouse monoclonal, clone P4D1, 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature or in the primary antibody against phosphothreonine (clone PTR-8, 1:200) or phosphoserine (clone PSR-45, 1:300) overnight at 4 °C. These primary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. After blotting with primary antibodies, the membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA; 1:8000) in 5% nonfat milk for 45 min. Proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) as described previously (30Tu V. Bahl J. Chen Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Chen Q. Liu J. Merrett J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed using 350 μg of protein from cell lysates harvested as described above. Protein samples were incubated on ice or rotated at 4 °C for 2 h with the primary antibody against c-Fos (1:100, rabbit polyclonal, SC number 52, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or ubiquitin (1:100, rabbit polyclonal, SPA-200, Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada). Following incubation with primary antibodies, 30 μl of protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads were added to samples and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 1 min and were then washed with 1 ml of PAN buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 followed by a wash with 1 ml of PAN buffer without Nonidet P-40. Samples were boiled for 10 min in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer for Western blot analysis as described above. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1.5 h from 1 μg of total RNA in 35 μl of reaction buffer. A fraction (3 μl) of cDNA was used for the 25-μl PCR with recombinant Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Madison, WI). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as reference gene. The PCR primer pair of c-fos cDNA are 5′-CCTCGAGGGGTTCCCGTAGA-3′ and 5′-ACAGTACGTGGATATAGCGA-3′ for 32 cycle amplifications at 94 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s. For amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the primer pair of 5′-AGACAGCCGCATCTTCTTGT-3′ and 5′-CCACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCA-3′ were used for 28 cycles using a condition described above. PCR products were detected by ethidium bromide staining after 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Phosphatase Treatment—Cells were harvested in 200 μl of NEB lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide), and the protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford method. Type 2 serine/threonine phosphatase A (PP2A, Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or B (PP2B, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to cell lysates to 0.0125 or 0.15 units/μg of protein of cell lysates, respectively. For treatment of immunoprecipitated c-Fos, PP2A was added to the concentration equivalent to 0.0125 unit/μg of protein of cell lysate. Sample volume was adjusted to 50 μl with the phosphatase reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MnCl2) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. For treatment with MG132, the 26 S proteasomal inhibitor was added to a final concentration of 50 μm before PP2A treatment. Following the PP2A or PP2B reactions, Laemmli buffer was added for 10 min of boiling and Western blot analysis. Calcineurin (PP2B) Activity Measurement—PP2B activity was measured using a commercially available kit (AK-816, BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The peptidyl phosphoserine phosphatase activity was measured using phosphoserine RII peptide as a substrate following the time course of appearance of inorganic phosphate detectable by malachite green (36Martin B. Pallen C.J. Wang J.H. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes (3 × 106 cells) were harvested in 250 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, with freshly added KI-132 protease inhibitor mixture; BIOMOL). After the removal of free phosphate and nucleotides using a resin column, 5 μl of cell lysates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with the substrate RII peptide (75 μm) in 50 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm CaCl2) in the presence or absence of the calcium chelator EGTA (20 mm). Products were measured by addition of 100 μl of malachite green reagent for absorbance at 630 nm. The amount of phosphate produced was calculated using a linear standard curve generated from 0 to 2 nm inorganic phosphate. Total phosphate activity reflects the amount of inorganic phosphate generated without EGTA in the reaction buffer. The activity of PP2B was calculated as the difference between the amounts of phosphate produced in the absence versus presence of EGTA. Hydrogen Peroxide Induces c-Fos Phosphorylation—H2O2 activates the AP-1 transcription factor in cardiomyocytes (31Tu V. Chen Q. Cardiovasc. Tox. 2003; 3: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicates the presence of c-Fos protein in the AP-1 complex of H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1). An increase in c-fos gene transcription has been shown to contribute to AP-1 activation in a number of experimental systems. As expected, an increase of c-Fos protein was observed in cardiomyocytes within 1 h after a 10-min exposure to 100 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2). This increase reached the highest level at 2 h, and returned toward the basal level after 3 h (Fig. 2). Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (2 μg/ml) after H2O2 treatment abolished the increase of c-Fos protein (Fig. 2), indicating that new protein synthesis contributes to c-Fos elevation. Better separation with a higher percentage of SDS-PAGE yielded multiple bands of c-Fos (Fig. 3). Time course and dose-response studies indicate the appearance of high molecular weight c-Fos bands at any given time point or with any H2O2 dose when an increase in c-Fos protein was detectable (Fig. 3, A and B). These data suggest the possibility of post-translational modification of newly synthesized c-Fos protein in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes.Fig. 2H2O2 induces transient elevation of c-Fos protein. Cardiomyocytes were treated with 100 μm H2O2 (HP) for 10 min and were then placed in fresh medium with or without 2 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were harvested immediately (0 h) or at the time point indicated after H2O2 treatment for SDS-PAGE (7% gel) and Western blot analysis (20 μg of protein/lane). The levels of c-Fos protein do not change in controls and a control sample harvested at 2 h after the medium change is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Time course and dose response of multiple bands of c-Fos protein in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes. Cells were treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 10 min and harvested at the indicated time points (A) or were treated with various doses of H2O2 for 10 min and harvested 1 h later (B). Cell lysates were used for SDS-PAGE (9% gel) and Western blot analyses (20 μg of protein/lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A few studies have indicated that c-Fos protein can be phosphorylated by serum stimulation (37Murphy L.O.

We tested whether the higher molecular weight bands represented phosphorylated c-Fos protein by a dephosphorylation reaction using the PP2A. Cell lysates were harvested at 1 or 2 h after H2O2 treatment for isolation of c-Fos by immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated c-Fos was incubated with or without PP2A for 30 min at 30 °C before detection by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitated c-Fos from H2O2-treated cells showed the presence of an upper band (Fig. 4). Following incubation with PP2A, the upper band disappeared; indicating that c-Fos was phosphorylated in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 4). The rat c-Fos protein contains 380 amino acids, among which 85 are serine, threonine, or tyrosine (40Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against phosphorylated serine, threonine, or tyrosine were used to identify the type of phosphorylation of c-Fos protein after H2O2 treatment. c-Fos protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation from control or H2O2-treated cells for Western blot analysis to detect for phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine. Phosphoserine was detected at 1 and 2 h after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5). In contrast, phosphothreonine was not altered in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 5). No signal was detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. H2O2 has been shown to activate the PI3K, p70 S6 kinase, p42/44ERK, p38, JNKs, and protein kinase C signaling pathways (30Tu V. Bahl J. Chen Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Tu V. Chen Q. Cardiovasc.

Pharmacological inhibitors allow us to test which of these signaling pathways might be involved in c-Fos phosphorylation. Cells were pretreated with specific inhibitors against ERKs (PD98059, 50 μm), p38 (SB202190, 10 μm), JNKs (JNK inhibitor I, 6 μm), PI3K (LY294002, 20 μm; and wortmannin, 100 nm), p70 S6 kinase (rapamycin, 10 ng/ml), protein kinase C (H-7, 2 μm), protein kinase A (H-89, 10 μm), or protein-tyrosine kinase (genistein, 40 μg/ml). The inhibitors at these doses have been reported to inhibit their targets in the literature or in our experimental model (30Tu V. Bahl J. Chen Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Tu V. Chen Q. Cardiovasc. Tox. 2003; 3: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After 30 min pretreatment with the inhibitors, cardiomyocytes were treated with H2O2 for 10 min and were incubated for 2 h before harvesting for Western blot analyses. The inhibitors of p42/44ERK, p38, PI3K, p70 S6 kinase, protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and tyrosine kinase did not appear to affect the formation of multiple bands of c-Fos in H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 6, A and C-E). In contrast, JNK inhibitor I, a cell permeable 32-amino acid peptide derived from the C-terminal domain of a JNK-binding protein and inhibits JNK activity by preventing JNK phosphorylation, caused a decreased c-Fos phosphorylation and protein level (Fig. 6B). JNKs are known to phosphorylate c-Jun and cause immediate activation of AP-1 transcription factor. The c-fos gene contains AP-1 binding sites in the promoter region, whereas oxidants have been shown to induce the transcription of the c-fos gene (32Nose K. Shibanuma M. Kikuchi K. Kageyama H. Sakiyama S. Kuroki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 33Li D.W. Spector A. Mol. Cell.

To exclude the possibility that inhibiting JNKs prevents c-fos transcription, we measured the level of c-fos transcripts after H2O2 treatment in the presence of the JNK inhibitor I. The time course studies showed that an increase of c-fos transcripts occu"
https://openalex.org/W2091911851,"The human polyomavirus, JC virus, has recently been associated with several human CNS tumors, including medulloblastomas and a broad range of glial-origin tumors. This ubiquitous virus is the causative agent of the rare demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised individuals. Expression of the viral protein, T-antigen, which possesses the ability to transform cells of neural origin, has been detected in human CNS tumors. In an effort to further understand the transforming potential of JCV T-antigen, transgenic mice expressing JCV T-antigen under the control of the Mad-4 promoter were generated. As described previously, approximately 50% of the animals developed pituitary tumors by 1 year of age. However, a small subset of the animals developed solid masses arising from the soft tissues surrounding the salivary gland, the sciatic nerve, and along the extremities that histologically resemble malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, rare neoplasms that occur in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). JCV T-antigen was detected in tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, but not in normal tissues and was colocalized with NF2, the putative tumor suppressor protein associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, in the nucleus of some cells. In addition, T-antigen was co-precipitated with NF2, but not with NF1 protein, although NF1 was detectable in tumor tissue. Furthermore, precipitated immunocomplexes contained T-antigen, NF2, and p53, suggesting that these three proteins may form a ternary complex. The importance of these findings on mechanisms of T-antigen-mediated tumorigenesis and the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W1969074879,"Iron and copper are redox active metals essential for life. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of iron and copper genes involved in metal acquisition and utilization is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. In addition iron and copper metabolism are inextricably linked because of the dependence on copper as a co-factor for iron uptake or mobilization. To further identify genes that function in iron and copper homeostasis, we screened for novel yeast mutants defective for iron limiting growth and thereby identified the CTI6 gene. Cti6 is a PHD finger-containing protein that has been shown to participate in the interaction of the Ssn6-Tup1 co-repressor with the Gcn5-containing SAGA chromatin-remodeling complex. In this report we show that CTI6 mRNA levels are increased under iron-limiting conditions, and that cti6 mutants display a growth defect under conditions of iron deprivation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cti6 is a nuclear protein that functionally associates with the Rpd3-Sin3 histone deacetylase complex involved in transcriptional repression. Cti6 demonstrates Rpd3-dependent transcriptional repression, and cti6 mutants exhibit an enhanced silencing of telomeric, rDNA and HMR loci, similar to mutants in genes encoding other Rpd3-Sin3-associated proteins. Microarray experiments with cti6 mutants grown under iron-limiting conditions show a down-regulation of telomeric genes and an up-regulation of Aft1 and Tup1 target genes involved in iron and oxygen regulation. Taken together, these data suggest a specific role for Cti6 in the regulation of gene expression under conditions of iron limitation. Iron and copper are redox active metals essential for life.

Microarray experiments with cti6 mutants grown under iron-limiting conditions show a down-regulation of telomeric genes and an up-regulation of Aft1 and Tup1 target genes involved in iron and oxygen regulation. Taken together, these data suggest a specific role for Cti6 in the regulation of gene expression under conditions of iron limitation. Iron and copper are redox active metals that are essential for life in virtually all organisms and serve as catalytic co-factors for a wide variety of key cellular enzymes. Furthermore, much experimental evidence has established biochemical links between the ability of organisms to acquire copper and their ability to import iron into cells or distribute iron within cells or to peripheral tissues. Recent work on a high affinity iron uptake system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and on the multicopper oxidase ceruloplasmin in mammalian cells, firmly established the mechanistic requirement for copper as a redox cofactor that is essential for iron mobilization (1Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In Baker's yeast the Fet3 multicopper ferroxidase functions together with an iron permease (Ftr1) and ferric reductases (Fre1 and Fre2) at the plasma membrane in high affinity iron uptake. This reductive system of iron uptake is fully dependent on copper, a cofactor for the Fet3 multicopper oxidase (2Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The ability of yeast cells to incorporate copper into Fet3 within a late secretory compartment requires copper uptake by the Ctr1 high affinity copper transporter and delivery of the copper by a cytosolic metallochaperone Atx1 to the copper-transporting ATPase Ccc2, localized in the trans Golgi network membrane. Ccc2 delivers copper into the lumen of the secretory pathway where it is loaded into Fet3 (for review see Ref. 3O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants defective for copper uptake through CTR1, or delivery to the lumen of the secretory compartment via mutations in ATX1 or CCC2, are unable to incorporate copper into the active sites of Fet3, resulting in defective high affinity iron uptake and a failure to grow under iron-limiting conditions. Consistent with this mechanism, the growth defect in limited iron and the absence of Fet3-dependent multicopper ferroxidase activity in ctr1, atx1, or ccc2 mutants can be reversed by the addition of copper to the growth medium.A key aspect to iron and copper homeostasis in S. cerevisiae is the regulation of transcription of genes encoding iron or copper homeostasis proteins in response to fluctuations in the availability of these two metals. Under conditions of copper limitation, the Mac1 copper-metalloregulatory transcription factor activates the expression of genes encoding components of the copper acquisition machinery that include the CTR1 and CTR3 high affinity plasma membrane copper transporters, the FRE1 and FRE7 metalloreductases, and other genes with as yet undescribed roles in copper homeostasis (2Dancis A.

In response to iron deprivation S. cerevisiae cells use two iron-responsive transcription factors, Aft1 and Aft2, to stimulate the expression of genes involved in iron acquisition, the so-called iron regulon (7Rutherford J.C.

Targets for Aft1/Aft2 regulation include (i) genes which protein products are involved in high affinity reductive iron uptake such as the plasma membrane metalloreductases FRE1–6 (8Georgatsou E.

Therefore, copper and iron acquisition and distribution are regulated by metalloregulatory transcription factors that both activate or extinguish transcription in accordance with metal availability.To explore additional aspects of the regulation of copper and iron acquisition, we screened a yeast haploid knock out library to identify genes that, when deleted, give rise to a growth defect under conditions of iron limitation that is rescued by exogenous iron and copper. One such mutant was identified in which the CTI6 gene is insertionally deleted. Recent results show that Cti6 associates with the Ssn6(Cyc8)-Tup1 co-repressor (17Papamichos-Chronakis M. Petrakis T. Ktistaki E. Topalidou I. Tzamarias D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The Ssn6-Tup1 complex is recruited to target promoters by different DNA-binding repressors including Mig1, Crt1, Rox1, and Sko1, and mediates repression of genes specifically required for growth under adverse conditions such as glucose starvation, DNA damage, hypoxia, or osmotic stress, respectively (for a review, see Ref. 18Smith R.L.

Surprisingly, it has been shown that the Ssn6-Tup1 complex can also activate transcription of specific target promoters (GAL1 and ABN1) by recruiting the Gcn5 HAT-containing SAGA complex (17Papamichos-Chronakis M.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This is possible because the Cti6 protein interacts simultaneously with the Ssn6-Tup1 and SAGA complexes, and mediates SAGA and TBP recruitment, histone acetylation, and transcriptional activation (17Papamichos-Chronakis M. Petrakis T. Ktistaki E. Topalidou I. Tzamarias D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have also shown that the Tup1 complex (Tup11/Tup12 in S. pombe) modulates the expression of iron-regulated genes by associating with the Aft1 (Fep1 in S. pombe) transcription factor (25Znaidi S. Pelletier B. Mukai Y. Labbe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9462-9474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Fragiadakis G.S. Tzamarias D. Alexandraki D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Here we demonstrate that the CTI6 gene is required for growth under iron-limiting conditions and for normal regulation of silencing. We demonstrate that CTI6 is localized to the nucleus, associated with the Rpd3-Sin3 HDAC complex, and exhibits Rpd3 histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional repression. Cti6 protein contains a PHD finger domain that is essential for growth under low iron and regulation of telomeric silencing, but not for the transcriptional repression activity. Finally, microarray experiments suggest that Cti6 may act as a repressor under low iron conditions in concert with the Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor. We discuss a potential role for Cti6, the Rpd3-Sin3 HDAC and the Ssn6-Tup1 complexes in cellular adaptive responses for growth under iron-limiting conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Genotypes for the yeast strains used in this work are listed in Supplemental Materials Table S1. To test growth on low iron, cells were grown in synthetic media (SC) to exponential phase (A600 = 1.0) and spotted in 10-fold serial dilutions starting at A600 = 0.1 onto SC alone (complete) or SC containing 75–100 μm BPS and 75–100 μm BCS (low iron/copper), or 1 mm ferrozine (not shown). For silencing assays, cells were spotted in 5-fold serial dilutions starting at A600 = 1.0 onto SC (complete), SC lacking specific requirements (SC minus), or SC containing 1 g/liter 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA).Plasmids—The wild type CTI6 gene and C95A, H100A, and C95A,H100A mutant alleles were amplified by PCR with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), cloned into pRS416 (CEN, URA3) and pRS415 (CEN, LEU2) vectors using SmaI and XhoI restriction sites, and sequenced. Wild type and mutant alleles of the CTI6 gene were cloned in phase into pBTM116 (pADH-LexA) plasmid, a gift from Ann Vojtek (University of Michigan), using SmaI and PstI restriction sites. The HDA1 gene was cloned into the pBTM116 plasmid using SmaI and SalI restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of the CTI6 gene was performed by the overlap extension method (27Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). M1835 (pADH-lexA) and M1836 (pADH-SIN3-LexA) plasmids were gifts from David Stillman (University of Utah), pJH330 (INO1-LacZ) from John Lopes (Wayne State University), and p6HA (STE6-CYC1-LacZ) from Ira Herskowitz (University of California, San Francisco).DNA Microarray and RNA Blot Analysis—For microarray experiments wild type BY4741 and cti6 mutant cells were grown to exponential phase in liquid SC medium containing 150 μm BPS and 150 μm BCS. Total RNA was isolated with a modified hot phenol method (28Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar). RNA was further purified with a Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the RNA samples was evaluated with an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Approximately 10 μg of total RNA from wild type and cti6 cells was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes, respectively. Cy-labeled RNA samples were hybridized with an Operon oligonucleotide yeast array. Data acquisition was performed using a GenePix Pro 4000A laser scanner (Axon Instruments). Only spots that had median values 2 times background were considered. For further information about preparation of the slides for microarrays, synthesis of fluorescent-labeled cDNA, hybridization, scanning and data acquisition, and quality control steps visit the Duke Microarray Core Facility web site. For RNA blot analysis, PCR-amplified fragments were radiolabeled with 32P and used as probes.β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were grown in selective media to exponential phase. For INO1-LacZ assays 1 mm choline and 0.75 mm inositol were added to the medium. Cells were harvested and β-galactosidase activity was measured in permeabilized cells as previously described (29Liu X.D. Morano K.A. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26654-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Microscopy—For Cti6 subcellular localization, wild type and mutant proteins were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the carboxyl terminus as previously described (30Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in selective media to exponential phase, and fluorescence visualized, photographed, and image processed as previously described (27Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For staining of yeast nuclei cells were incubated for 15 min with 10 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.RESULTScti6 Mutants Exhibit a Growth Defect under Iron-limiting Conditions—The acquisition of iron through the Fet3 multicopper ferroxidase is a copper-dependent process, and mutations in the copper uptake pathway (ctr1) or in the delivery of copper to the secretory compartment (atx1 or ccc2) render cells defective in high affinity iron uptake, which can be corrected by increased exogenous copper levels. We screened a haploid yeast deletion library to ascertain if mutations in other loci conferred growth defects under iron-limited conditions that are rescued by extracellular iron and copper addition. One mutant, cti6, showed a dramatic growth defect under iron scarcity achieved by addition of the extracellular Fe(II) chelator BPS plus the Cu(I) chelator BCS (low iron/copper, Fig. 1, A and B). cti6 growth defects were also observed by using the intracellular Fe(II) chelator ferrozine or BPS alone (data not shown), but because addition of BCS further decreases the availability of iron, BPS and BCS were used for further studies. Under these conditions cti6 mutants show a growth defect similar to ctr1, atx1, and ccc2 mutants (Fig. 1A). The growth defect of the cti6 mutant was fully complemented by the addition of low concentrations of iron. Only 10 μm iron suppressed the growth defect of the atx1 and cti6 mutants, and up to 25 μm iron was required for growth recovery of ctr1 and ccc2 cells (Fig. 1A). Addition of copper also complemented the cti6 growth defect (Fig. 1A). Addition of 5 μm copper stimulated growth of the atx1 and cti6 mutants. Higher copper concentrations robustly suppressed the growth defect of cti6 and ctr1 (25 μm), and ccc2 (50 μm) mutants (Fig. 1A). cti6 growth defect in low iron was also rescued by reintroducing the wild type or an allele in which the Cti6 carboxyl terminus was tagged with GFP in a centromeric plasmid under the control of CTI6 wild type promoter (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that cti6 mutants are defective for growth under conditions of iron scarcity and are rescued by addition of extracellular iron and copper.CTI6 mRNA Levels Are Increased under Low Iron Conditions—Because the CTI6 gene is required for growth under iron-limited conditions, we ascertained whether CTI6 mRNA levels are regulated by iron availability. RNA blotting was performed using wild type cells, cells defective in the iron-sensing transcription factor Aft1 (aft1), and cells lacking both Aft1 and Aft2 (aft1 aft2). Cells were grown to exponential phase under iron-replete (+100 μm iron) and iron-limited (+100 μm BPS) conditions. The multicopper ferroxidase gene FET3, whose expression is induced under low iron conditions by the Aft1 transcription factor, was used as a control for iron-regulated gene expression. As previously reported (31Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), FET3 mRNA levels increased under low iron conditions, and this induction was dependent on the Aft1 transcription factor (Fig. 1, C and D). However, the levels of CTI6 mRNA were only slightly increased in wild type cells grown under iron limitation (Fig. 1, C and D). This CTI6 basal expression was absent in a cti6 deletion mutant (data not shown). CTI6 mRNA levels under low iron conditions were considerably increased in both the aft1 and aft1 aft2 mutants, which sense a much more severe iron starvation because of the loss of expression of genes involved in iron uptake (Fig. 1, C and D). Unlike FET3, the CTI6 promoter lacks Aft1-Aft2-binding sites, consistent with our observation that Aft1 and Aft2 do not mediate the elevation in CTI6 steady state mRNA levels in response to iron deprivation. Interestingly, increased CTI6 (YPL181w) mRNA levels have also been reported previously in mutants defective in frataxin (Yfh1), a mitochondrial matrix protein required for iron-sulfur synthesis and export from mitochondria (32Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Both aft1 and yfh1 mutant cells grown under low iron conditions show an increase in iron deficiency compared with wild type cells because of a defect in iron uptake and mobilization. Taken together, these results indicate that CTI6 mRNA steady state levels increase during conditions of iron scarcity in a manner that is independent of the Aft1/2 iron-responsive transcription factors.The Cti6 PHD Finger Is Important for Growth under Iron-limiting Conditions—Cti6 is a PHD finger-containing protein. PHD fingers are zinc finger-like motifs of ∼60 amino acids defined by seven cysteines and one histidine arranged as C4HC3, with non-conserved intervening sequences. The PHD finger has been found in many eukaryotic proteins including transcription factors and proteins involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation (reviewed in Ref. 33Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The structure of the PHD finger of the KAP-1 corepressor has been solved recently showing that it binds two zinc atoms in a cross-brace RING-like arrangement (34Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). According to this model, Cti6 protein could coordinate one zinc atom to cysteine residues 75, 77, and 103, and histidine residue 100 (site I), whereas the second zinc atom would coordinate to cysteine residues 92, 95, 117, and 120 (site II). To ascertain whether the PHD finger in the Cti6 protein is important for growth under conditions of iron deprivation, cysteine residue 95, a putative metal ligand for site II, and histidine residue 100, a predicted zinc ligand for site I, were converted to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2A). Both single mutants were unable to complement the cti6 growth defect under iron-limiting conditions (Fig. 2B). The double mutant C95A,H100A did not show any additional growth defect (Fig. 2B). Cti6 PHD finger mutants epitope-tagged with GFP were expressed at similar levels as wild type Cti6 and were properly localized (Fig. 3 and data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the integrity of the Cti6 PHD finger is important for growth under conditions of iron scarcity.Fig. 2The Cti6 PHD finger is required for growth under iron-limiting conditions.

The same nuclear localization for both wild type and mutant was observed when cells were grown in 100 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 100 μm CuSO4, 100 μm BPS or 100 μm BCS containing media (data not shown). DIC, differential interference microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To ascertain the specificity of the iron limitation growth defect observed for cti6 mutants we analyzed the growth rates, under iron-limited conditions, for the 15 additional mutants corresponding to genes in the S. cerevisiae genome coding for proteins containing PHD fingers. Of these, only cells harboring an insertional inactivation of the PHO23 gene also showed a considerable growth defect under iron scarcity (Supplemental Materials Fig. S1). Interestingly, Pho23 has been recently shown to be a component of the Rpd3-Sin3 HDAC required for regulation of gene expression and silencing (35Loewith R. Smith J.S. Meijer M. Williams T.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24068-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Cti6 Is a Nuclear Protein—The molecular function of the PHD finger motif has not been elucidated but, in analogy with LIM (C2HC5) and RING (C3HC4) domains, it has been suggested that PHD fingers could be involved in protein-protein interactions. Proteins containing PHD, LIM, or RING domains are often involved in transcriptional control either directly, or by recruiting co-repressors or co-activators (33Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). To obtain further insight into the function of Cti6 we epitope-tagged the protein at the carboxyl terminus with the GFP to determine its subcellular localization. Expression of the Cti6-GFP fusion protein under the control of the CTI6 promoter fully rescued the growth defect observed for a cti6 mutant strain under low iron conditions (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence microcopy of these cells showed a Cti6-GFP fluorescence signal that overlapped with the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Fig. 3, top panels). Mutagenesis of amino acid residues 95 and 100 (C95A,H100A mutant, Fig. 3, bottom panels), or growth under different concentrations of iron or copper availability (not shown) did not affect Cti6-GFP nuclear localization or protein levels. These results demonstrate that Cti6 is a nuclear protein, and strongly suggest that the integrity of the PHD finger, whereas essential for its role in cell growth under conditions of iron deprivation, is not required for its targeting to the nucleus.A LexA-Cti6 Fusion Protein Mediates Rpd3-dependent Transcriptional Repression—Two independent reports have described large scale approaches to analyze multiprotein complexes in S. cerevisiae via the use of tandem affinity purification or FLAG epitopes (36Gavin A.C.

https://openalex.org/W2024694328,"The HIV-1 Nef protein is a critical virulence factor that exerts multiple effects during viral replication. Nef modulates surface expression of various cellular proteins including CD4 and MHC-I, enhances viral infectivity, and affects signal transduction pathways. Nef has been shown to partially associate with rafts, where it can prime T cells for activation. The contribution of rafts during Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation and enhancement of viral replication remains poorly understood. We show here that Nef does not modify the palmitoylation state of CD4 or its partition within rafts. Moreover, CD4 mutants lacking palmitoylation or unable to associate with rafts are efficiently down-regulated by Nef. In HIV-infected cells, viral assembly and budding occurs from rafts, and Nef has been suggested to increase this process. However, using T cells acutely infected with wild-type or nef-deleted HIV, we did not observe any impact of Nef on raft segregation of viral structural proteins. We have also designed a palmitoylated mutant of Nef (NefG3C), which significantly accumulates in rafts. Interestingly, the efficiency of NefG3C to down-regulate CD4 and MHC-I, and to promote viral replication was not increased when compared with the wild-type protein. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that rafts are not a key element involved in the effects of Nef on trafficking of cellular proteins and on viral replication. The HIV-1 Nef protein is a critical virulence factor that exerts multiple effects during viral replication. Nef modulates surface expression of various cellular proteins including CD4 and MHC-I, enhances viral infectivity, and affects signal transduction pathways. Nef has been shown to partially associate with rafts, where it can prime T cells for activation. The contribution of rafts during Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation and enhancement of viral replication remains poorly understood. We show here that Nef does not modify the palmitoylation state of CD4 or its partition within rafts. Moreover, CD4 mutants lacking palmitoylation or unable to associate with rafts are efficiently down-regulated by Nef. In HIV-infected cells, viral assembly and budding occurs from rafts, and Nef has been suggested to increase this process.

Nef protein is a critical player of viral pathogenesis (1Kestler H.W. Ringler D.J. Mori K. Panicali D.L. Sehgal P.K. Daniel M.D. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 651-662Google Scholar, 2Hanna Z.

In cell cultures, many different Nef activities have been reported (4Fackler O.T. Baur A.S. Immunity. 2002; 16: 493-497Google Scholar). Nef is a 27 kDa myristoylated protein and is expressed early and abundantly during viral infection. Nef affects the intracellular trafficking of a number of proteins, including CD4, MHC-I and MHC-II, CD28, DC-SIGN, TNF, and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins (5Guy B. Kieny M.P. Rivière Y. Le Peuch C. Dott K.

One of the best characterized function of Nef is the down-regulation of CD4, which occurs by a rapid endocytosis of surface molecules (12Garcia J.V. Miller A.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 508-511Google Scholar, 13Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Google Scholar, 14Schwartz O. Dautry-Varsat A. Goud B. Maréchal V. Subtil A. Heard J.M. Danos O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 528-533Google Scholar). Reduction of CD4 surface expression may facilitate viral release and infectivity of virions, and may prevent Env-associated cytopathic effects, resulting in an optimal viral replication (6Schwartz O. Rivière Y. Heard J.M. Danos O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3274-3280Google Scholar, 15Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 622-631Google Scholar, 16Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr.

Nef misroutes CD4 and other proteins through an interaction with a number of sorting proteins, including β-COP, AP complexes, and PACS-1 (18Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodeus M. Durand H. Doute M.

Trono D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 163-167Google Scholar). Overexpression of Nef also provokes pleiotropic effects on sorting organelles, inducing the accumulation of clathrin-coated pits, endosomes, lysosomes, and multivesicular bodies (22Foti M. Mangasarian A. Piguet V. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Trono D. Carpentier J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 37-47Google Scholar, 23Sanfridson A. Hester S. Doyle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nef facilitates viral propagation by different means. Viral particles produced in the presence of Nef are more infectious (25Schwartz O. Maréchal V. Danos O. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4053-4059Google Scholar, 26Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Google Scholar), performing more efficiently the early steps of the replicative cycle (25Schwartz O. Maréchal V. Danos O. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4053-4059Google Scholar, 26Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Google Scholar, 27Tobiume M. Lineberger J.E. Lundquist C.A.

Nef also exerts direct and indirect positive effects on virus replication in primary human lymphocytes (26Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Google Scholar, 29de Ronde A. Klaver B. Keulen W. Smit L. Goudsmit J. Virology. 1992; 188: 391-395Google Scholar, 30Spina C.A. Kwoh T.J. Chowers M.Y. Guatelli J.C. Richman D.D. J. Exp.

Direct effects are particularly visible in lymphocytes activated a few days after infection, in which replication of nef-deleted HIV (HIVΔnef) is barely detectable. Nef also indirectly impacts lymphocytes, when expressed in macrophages or in dendritic cells: HIV-infected macrophages or dendritic cells release paracrine factors (chemokines, soluble CD23, and soluble ICAM), which permit the infection of resting T cells (32Swingler S. Mann A. Jacque J. Brichacek B. Sasseville V.G. Williams K. Lackner A.A. Janoff E.N. Wang R. Fisher D. Stevenson M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 997-1003Google Scholar, 33Messmer D. Jacque J.M. Santisteban C.

Stevenson M. Nature. 2003; 424: 213-219Google Scholar). The capacity of HIV to replicate in non-activated lymphocytes is likely linked to the numerous described effects of Nef on T cell activation. Nef interacts with a number of kinases or other cellular proteins involved in signal transduction pathways (4Fackler O.T. Baur A.S. Immunity. 2002; 16: 493-497Google Scholar, 35Saksela K.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E6Google Scholar), potentially priming infected cells for activation and protecting them from apoptosis (38Simmons A. Aluvihare V. McMichael A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 763-777Google Scholar, 39Geleziunas R. Xu W. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Greene W.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 834-838Google Scholar, 40Wolf D. Witte V. Laffert B. Blume K. Stromer E. Trapp S. d'Aloja P. Schurmann A. Baur A.S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1217-1224Google Scholar). Nef has been suggested to act at the level of rafts to trigger cell activation (41Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Google Scholar). Rafts are involved in many biological events, including intracellular protein trafficking, signal transduction pathways, entry and release of various virus species (42Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar, 43Suomalainen M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 705-709Google Scholar, 44Chazal N. Gerlier D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 226-237Google Scholar, 45Briggs J.A. Wilk T. Fuller S.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 757-768Google Scholar). Regarding HIV, rafts are thought to operate at multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Rafts were initially proposed to act as platforms for virus entry, facilitating interactions between CD4 co-receptors, and incoming virions (44Chazal N. Gerlier D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 226-237Google Scholar, 46Manes S. del Real G. Lacalle R.A. Lucas P. Gomez-Mouton C. Sanchez-Palomino S. Delgado R. Alcami J. Mira E. Martinez A.C.

This role has been, however, recently questioned, because CD4 molecules unable to associate with rafts still allow virus entry (49Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Google Scholar, 50Popik W. Alce T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 704-712Google Scholar). There is also mounting evidence that rafts are important for HIV-1 assembly and budding. HIV-1 Gag and Env viral structural components are concentrated in rafts or in raft-like complexes (51Nguyen D.H. Hildreth J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3264-3272Google Scholar, 52Ono A. Freed E.O. Proc.

Viral particles are enriched in cellular raft proteins and lipids, and cholesterol-depleting agents decrease viral infectivity. Interestingly, Nef has been proposed to increase viral infectivity via lipid rafts. In this model, Nef induces accumulation of Gag within rafts, thus facilitating viral release from these membrane domains (58Zheng Y.H. Plemenitas A. Linnemann T. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 875-879Google Scholar). Nef may also increase synthesis and transport of cholesterol to rafts and progeny virions (59Zheng Y.H. Plemenitas A. Fielding C.J. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8460-8465Google Scholar). Recently, raft targeting by Nef has been reported to be functionally important for CD4 and MHC-I down-regulation as well as infectivity enhancement (60Alexander M. Bor Y. Ravichandran K.S. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1685-1696Google Scholar). These conclusions were drawn by comparing the activity of LAT-Nef chimeras accumulating in rafts or excluded from these domains. Association of cellular and viral proteins with rafts is often regulated by palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational fatty acylation of many proteins, such as transmembrane receptors, G-proteins, tyrosine kinases (61Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Google Scholar, 62Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Google Scholar, 63Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Google Scholar), as well as viral envelope glycoproteins (64Olsen K.E. Andersen K.B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8975-8981Google Scholar, 65Nozawa N. Daikoku T. Koshizuka T. Yamauchi Y. Yoshikawa T. Nishiyama Y. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3204-3216Google Scholar, 66Li M. Yang C. Tong S. Weidmann A. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11845-11852Google Scholar, 67Ochsenbauer-Jambor C. Miller D.C. Roberts C.R. Rhee S.S. Hunter E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11544-11554Google Scholar, 68Zhang J. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4634-4644Google Scholar). Palmitoylation generally occurs on cysteine residues located close to cellular membranes. The reversible nature of the thioester bound that links palmitate to cysteine allows dynamic changes in protein palmitoylation (63Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Google Scholar, 69el-Husseini Ael D. Bredt D.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 791-802Google Scholar). Palmitoylation regulates protein trafficking and association with plasma membranes and with rafts. It also potentially modulates protein activity, oligomerization, and interaction with other proteins. At least two proteins involved in HIV replication are known to be palmitoylated, the cellular receptor CD4 and the viral Env glycoprotein. Efficient CD4 association with rafts requires palmitoylation, but also interaction with the tyrosine kinase p56Lck (49Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Google Scholar, 50Popik W. Alce T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 704-712Google Scholar, 70Fragoso R. Ren D. Zhang X. Su M.W. Burakoff S.J. Jin Y.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 913-921Google Scholar). CD4 palmitoylation occurs on two membrane proximal residues (49Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Google Scholar, 71Crise B. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13593-13597Google Scholar) and also requires a short cluster of positively charged residues within the cytoplasmic tail (50Popik W. Alce T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 704-712Google Scholar). HIV-1 Env glycoproteins are palmitoylated on two intracellular cysteines (56Rousso I. Mixon M.B. Chen B.K. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13523-13525Google Scholar, 72Yang C. Spies C.P. Compans R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9871-9875Google Scholar). Mutating these residues did not affect cell fusion activity or surface expression of HIV-1 Env, but abrogated raft association, virion incorporation, and viral infectivity. In general, palmitoylation is a reversible and dynamic process. Two major classes of palmitoylthioesterases have been described. One family is lysosomal; the second is cytosolic and removes palmitate moieties from membrane-associated proteins (73Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Google Scholar). Nef induces CD4 endocytosis and disrupts the association between CD4 and Lck (13Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Google Scholar, 14Schwartz O. Dautry-Varsat A. Goud B. Maréchal V. Subtil A. Heard J.M. Danos O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 528-533Google Scholar, 74Salghetti S. Mariani R. Skowronski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 349-353Google Scholar). Of note, Nef also efficiently binds to a thioesterase enzyme, although the role of this enzyme in Nef function remains unknown (75Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Google Scholar, 76Cohen G.B. Rangan V.S. Chen B.K. Smith S. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23097-23105Google Scholar). The central role of rafts in many cellular events parallels the multiple activity of Nef on cellular trafficking, signal transduction pathways, and viral replication. We therefore asked whether rafts intervene in the effects of Nef on CD4 down-regulation, and examined whether the down-regulating activity of Nef on CD4 is associated with a modification of the palmitoylation state of CD4. We also asked whether Nef improves viral infectivity by increasing the association of Gag with detergent-resistant membranes. We report here that Nef-induced CD4 down-regulation is independent of CD4 palmitoylation or raft association. We also show that Nef is associated at rather low levels with rafts. We have designed a palmitoylated Nef mutant, which strongly accumulates within rafts. However, targeting Nef to rafts does not improve CD4 or MHC-I down-regulation and does not facilitate viral replication in non-activated primary lymphocytes. Furthermore, Nef does not modify the raft segregation of Env and Gag proteins. Therefore, rafts are not a key element involved in the effects of Nef on trafficking of cellular proteins and on viral replication. Cells, Viruses, and Infections—A2.01 T cells, Jurkat T cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/ml each, Sigma). A2.01 cells expressing WT and mutant CD4 have been described (49Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors using Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. The production and use of WT and mutant HIV (from NL4.3 or NLAD8 strains) have been described (77Maréchal V. Clavel F. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2208-2212Google Scholar, 78Petit C. Buseyne F. Boccaccio C. Abastado J.P. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. Virology. 2001; 286: 225-236Google Scholar). For HIV replication experiments, freshly prepared PBMCs were exposed to the indicated virus stocks (viral input ranging from 20 to 0.02 ng of p24/106 cells) for 2 h 30 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well, in triplicates). Four days after infection, cells were activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 1 μg/ml, Abbott) and grown in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2, 50 international units/ml, Chiron). Alternatively, HIV replication experiments were performed with PBMC activated (with PHA and IL-2) 3 days prior to infection. Viral replication was monitored by measuring HIV-1 Gag p24 release in supernatants by ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Jurkat cells (30 × 106 cells per point) were infected with the indicated virus stocks, (50 ng of p24/106 cells), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured for 1 or 2 days before proceeding with further experiments. Single cycle infections of P4C5 cells were performed as described earlier (77Maréchal V. Clavel F. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2208-2212Google Scholar). Viral infectivity was measured 24 h after viral exposure. Design and Use of Plasmids and Lentiviral Vectors—Nef WT and Nef mock plasmids carry the nef gene (from the HIV LAI isolate) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, in a sense and antisense orientation, respectively (19Le Gall S. Erdtmann L. Benichou S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Benarous R. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 483-495Google Scholar). pHR′Nef lentiviral vector encoding the HIV LAI (also termed R7) nef gene (under the control of the elongation factor-1α promoter) was a kind gift from Didier Trono (41Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Google Scholar). nef G3C and G2A mutants were generated using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). Mutations were introduced in Nef WT plasmid, in pHR′Nef vector, or in pNL4.3 and pNLAD8 proviruses. The accuracy of the mutations was verified by sequencing. The CD4 LL/AA mutant was introduced in the pTRIP CD4 lentiviral vector (49Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Google Scholar). Lentiviral vector particle production and transduction of A2.01 CD4 T-cells or Jurkat T cells were performed as described (11Sol-Foulon N. Moris A. Nobile C. Boccaccio C. Engering A. Abastado J.P.

Flow Cytometry and Immunofluorescence Analysis—A2.01 and Jurkat cells were stained with anti-CD4 (SK3-PE, BD Biosciences) and anti-MHC-I (W6.32-FITC, Sigma) mAbs, 6 days after transduction with lentiviral vectors. Anti-Gag staining was performed on permeabilized HIV-infected Jurkat cells using an anti-p24 mAb (KC57-RDE, Beckman Coulter). HeLa cells were stained with anti-CD4 (SK3-PE) or with anti-HLA-A2 (BB7.2) (19Le Gall S. Erdtmann L. Benichou S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Benarous R. Heard J.M. Schwartz O.

Surface levels of CD4 and HLA-A2 were measured in GFP+ cells, which represented the fraction of the cell population (∼30–50% of cells) that was transfected. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACScalibur apparatus (BD Biosciences). Isotype-matched mAbs were used as negative controls in all experiments.

Briefly, 30 × 106 cells were washed twice in ice-cold TKM buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCL, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then incubated for 1 h on ice in TKM containing 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), in a final volume of 0.375 ml. Cell lysates were loaded onto a 5-ml discontinuous sucrose gradient (5 to 35–40% in w/v) and then centrifuged at equilibrium for 18 h at 4 °C and 200,000 × g (Beckman L70-ultracentrifuge). Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and their protein contents were estimated using the Nano-Orange quantification kit (Molecular Probes). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Equal volumes of each fraction of the gradient were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 4–12% NuPage Gel (Invitrogen) under reducing (for the analysis of CD4, p56Lck, Gag, Env, and Nef) or non-reducing (for the analysis of CD46) conditions. For immunodetection, the following antibodies were used: CD4 (1F6, Novocastra), p56Lck (sc-13, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD46 (J4–48 Immunotech), Gag p24 and p17 (25A+18A mAbs) (79Petit C.

In addition to the full-length primase-helicase, a 56-kDa isoform lacking the ZBD is produced from an in-frame translation initiation site within T7 gene 4 during phage growth (35Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The 56-kDa isoform of the primase-helicase has helicase activity but no primer synthesis activity (30Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12446-12453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primase remains associated with its tetraribonucleotide product on the DNA template until DNA polymerase initiates synthesis (38Kato M. Frick D.N. Lee J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21809-21820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this role the primase can prevent dissociation of these short primers from the template and stabilize the primed template in the active site of DNA polymerase (3Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The zinc binding domain alone of T7 primase stimulates primer utilization by T7 DNA polymerase (15Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The proteinprotein interactions mediating the transfer of a primed template to DNA polymerase are starting to be elucidated in several different replication systems. During replication in E. coli, the primed DNA template is transferred from the DnaG primase to DNA polymerase III by the combined action of the β clamp loader and the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) (39Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, T7 primase-helicase directly transfers a newly synthesized primer to T7 DNA polymerase and stimulates primer extension by the polymerase through an intimate physical interaction of the primase and polymerase (29Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21809-21820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).We proposed a mechanistic model for primer synthesis and transfer to DNA polymerase that is based on a crystal structure of T7 primase along with NMR and biochemical data (15Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). T7 primase has a bipartite structure consisting of the ZBD and RPD separated by an extended linker. These domains do not interact with each other in the absence of substrates (open conformation of the primase) (15Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). During primer synthesis, the primase undergoes a conformational change in the linker region that brings the ZBD and RPD in contact with the template and nucleotide substrates (closed conformation). After a primer is synthesized, the RPD releases the primed DNA template, and the ZBD alone delivers the primed template to DNA polymerase. The recent crystal structure of the ring-shaped T7 primase-helicase is consistent with this mechanism of primer synthesis (16Toth E.A. Li Y. Sawaya M.R. Cheng Y. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1113-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The structure reveals the outward flexure of the primase domain that makes room between two neighboring primase subunits where the RNA polymerase active sites are located. This flexible architecture would allow the ZBD to engage the template along with the RNA polymerase active site.The small size of the ZBD (59 residues) raises questions about how it binds to the primed template and engages DNA polymerase to stimulate primer extension activity. In this study, we focused on the interactions between the ZBD and primed template that support the synthesis of oligoribonucleotide primers and their utilization by T7 DNA polymerase. NMR binding experiments and mutagenic studies of the ZBD revealed that the same surface of the ZBD remains in contact with the primed template during primer synthesis and extension by the polymerase, consistent with the important role of the ZBD for both steps of the initiation of DNA synthesis. The utilization of primers was inhibited by the T7 ssDNA-binding protein (gp2.5), which interacts strongly with the polymerase and may chaperone the polymerase to the site of primer synthesis during each round of Okazaki fragment synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The DNA template strands used in this study were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 394A synthesizer and purified by gel electrophoresis in urea-acrylamide gels. The 3′-biotinylated and 3′-(1-dimethoxytrityloxy-3-[O-(N-carboxy-(di-O-pivaloyl-fluorescein)-3-aminopropyl)]-propyl-2-O-succinoyl-long chain alkylamino (6-FAM))-labeled DNA templates were synthesized on controlled pore glass supports coupled to 3′-biotin or 3′-(6-FAM) (Glen Research), respectively. The altered T7 DNA polymerase used in this studies has two amino acid substitutions in the active site of the 3′–5′-exonuclease (Asp-5 → Ala and Glu-7 → Ala) that decrease 3′–5′-exonuclease activity by a factor of 106 (40Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). T7 DNA polymerase and gp4 primase-helicase were overexpressed and purified as described previously (23Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

The wild-type and C-terminally truncated gp2.5 were provided by Boriana Marintcheva (Harvard Medical School). The synthetic oligoribonucleotide (ACCC) was purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc., and the 5′ end was phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP and phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Streptavidin-agarose beads were obtained from Sigma. E. coli BL21(DE3) was obtained from Novagen, and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. dNTPs were purchased from Promega Corp. ATP, CTP, and all radiolabeled materials were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Protein Expression and Purification—The expression and purification of the ZBD and RPD of the T7 primase have been described previously (15Kato M. Ito T. Wagner G. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid for a C-terminally His6 affinity-tagged ZBD was constructed by cloning the NdeI-HindIII fragment of the wild-type ZBD plasmid between the NcoI and HindIII sites of pET28a (Novagen). Site-directed mutations of the C-terminally His6-tagged ZBD were constructed by inserting PCR fragments amplified from plasmids of mutant gene 4 proteins (32Kusakabe T. Hine A.V. Hyberts S.G. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4295-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) into the NcoI-HindIII site of pET28a or by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the His6-tagged ZBD plasmid. The primers for site-directed mutagenesis were 27 nucleotides in length and contained the sequence 5′-GCG-3′ at the center encoding the alanine mutation. The full list of primers is found in Supplemental Table 1. The His6-tagged ZBD proteins were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted; resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 500 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm PMSF; and then homogenized by the microfluidizer Emul-siFlex-C5 (Avestin). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g followed by filtration of the supernatant (0.45-μm pore). The protein solution was then loaded on a HiTrap nickel-chelating column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with 60 ml of buffer A containing 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 500 mm KCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 60 mm imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted by stepwise increases in imidazole from 80 to 160 mm in 20 mm increments. The His6-tagged ZBDs eluted at about 120 mm imidazole, and the eluted fractions were combined and concentrated using a Centricon-3 ultrafiltration device (Amicon). The concentrated ZBD proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 200 mm NaCl, and 30% glycerol and then stored at -20 °C. Some of the mutant ZBDs were less soluble in this buffer, and the sodium chloride concentration was increased up to 400 mm to maintain solubility.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed using an AVIV model 62DS spectropolarimeter with a thermostated cuvette of 1-mm path length. All proteins were prepared at the concentration of 10 μm in 300 μl of sample buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl. Five recorded wavelength scans (250–195 nm) were collected at 10 °C with a signal-averaging time of 3 s and averaged together before subtracting the background spectrum of a buffer blank. The CD spectra were analyzed with the K2d program 2See www.embl-heidelberg.de/~andrade/k2d.html. to estimate the fraction of α-helical and β-strand secondary structures (43Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar).NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignments—Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected from 500-μl samples containing 90 μm15N-labeled ZBD in 200 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 20 mm MgCl2 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at 25 °C using a 400-MHz Unityplus, a 500-MHz UnityInova, or a 750-MHz UnityInova Varian spectrometer. Some spectra were measured with a Cold Probe. The DNA template (5′-GGGTCAA-3′) and synthetic RNA primer (5′-ACCC-3′) were lyophilized in separate tubes. The spectrum of the ZBD alone was measured, and then the lyophilized DNA template was resuspended with the buffered protein solution to yield a final concentration of 0.4 mm ssDNA. The spectrum of ZBD-ssDNA mixture was recorded, and then the lyophilized RNA primer was dissolved in the protein-DNA solution (0.4 mm primer final concentration), and the NMR spectrum of the ZBD-ssDNA-RNA was recorded.Standard triple resonance spectra were recorded for the assignment of residues within the ZBD (59 amino acids). The protein sample contained 500 μm15N-labeled or 13C,15N-labeled ZBD, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10% D2O. The resonances were assigned for 52 of the 57 non-proline backbone amides within the ZBD using the HNCA, HN-(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCA(CO)NH, and CBCANH spectra along with three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC experiments (44Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were initially processed using NMRPipe (45Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11347) Google Scholar) and then analyzed with NMRView (46Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2657) Google Scholar).Primer Synthesis and Extension Assays—Primer synthesis assays were carried out as described before (38Kato M. Frick D.N. Lee J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21809-21820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 1 mm each of ATP and CTP, 0.2 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm 26-mer DNA template (5′-CAGTGACGGGTCGTTTATCGTCGGCA-3′), 50 μm RPD, and 10 μm ZBD or ZBD mutants in reaction buffer A consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then quenched with an equal volume of 98% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 20 mm EDTA. The products were separated by electrophoresis in a 25% acrylamide gel containing 3 m urea and visualized by autoradiography. The relative activities of the mutant ZBDs were compared after dividing the product intensities of primer extension reaction by that of a control reaction using the wild-type ZBD.Primer extension assays were carried out in 10-μl reactions containing 50 μm 26-mer DNA template (5′-CAGTGACGGGTCGTTTATCGTCGGCA-3′), 50 μm 5′-[32P]ACCC, and 0.3 mm each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP along with 1 μm T7 DNA polymerase in reaction buffer A containing the indicated concentrations of the ZBD, RPD, or T7 primase. The reactions were incubated for1hat room temperature, and the products were separated in 25% acrylamide gels containing 3 m urea and then visualized by autoradiography. The intensities of the fully extended primer strands were subtracted from the background extension activity of the DNA polymerase without primase. The relative enhancements of primer extension of each primase were calculated by dividing the intensities with that of the background extension. For the primer extension assays of the ZBD mutants, a fixed concentration (10 μm) of the ZBD or ZBD mutants was used in the same reaction as above. The relative activities of the mutant ZBDs for stimulating primer extension by T7 DNA polymerase were normalized to the activity of the wild-type ZBD.To measure inhibition by gp2.5, the primer extension reactions (10 μl) contained 50 μm 26-mer DNA template (5′-CAGTGACGGGTCGTTTATCGTCGGCA-3′), 50 μm 5′-[32P]ACCC, and 0.3 mm each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP along with 1 μm T7 DNA polymerase; 50 μm ZBD, 10 μm T7 primase, or 10 μm primase-helicase protein; and the specified concentrations of gp2.5 (either full-length gp2.5 or the C-terminally truncated mutant gp2.5Δ26) (9Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in reaction buffer A. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then the products were separated by electrophoresis in a 25% acrylamide gel containing 3 m urea and visualized by autoradiography. The primer extension activities in the presence of different concentrations of gp2.5 were normalized to the activity of a reaction without gp2.5 by taking the ratio of the product intensities.Isolation of the Priming Complex—The isolation of the protein-DNA complexes containing T7 DNA polymerase and T7 primase were carried out in reactions (10 μl) containing 20 μm 26-mer biotinylated DNA template (5′-CAGTGACGGGTCGTTTATCGTCGGCA-biotin-3′), 3 mm each of ATP and CTP, 0.9 mm each of dGTP and ddTTP, 20 μm T7 DNA polymerase, and 20 μm T7 primase in the reaction buffer. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, dCTP (10 mm) and Tween 20 (0.2%) were added to the reactions followed by another incubation on ice for 10 min. Streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) were washed in a spin filter (Nanosep MF, Pall Filtron) with an equilibrium buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.2% Tween 20, and the reaction mixtures were mixed with the washed beads followed by incubation for 10 min on ice. For reactions inhibited by gp2.5, 20 μm gp2.5 was added at this time. The beads were washed three times with 100 μl of wash buffer at 4 °C in the spin filter. The wash buffer consisted of the reaction buffer plus 0.2% Tween 20, 200 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. The washed avidin beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and centrifuged to elute the bound proteins. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250.For the complex containing the ZBD and the DNA polymerase, a primer strand was synthesized separately in synthesis buffer containing 100 μm 26-mer biotinylated DNA template (5′-CAGTGACGGGTCGTTTATCGTCGGCA-biotin-3), 1 mm each of ATP and CTP, 0.3 mm each of dGTP and ddTTP, 100 nm T7 DNA polymerase, and 100 nm T7 primase in the reaction buffer. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The binding mixture (10 μl) contained 2 μl of the primer synthesis reaction (the final concentration of template was 20 μm), 20 μm T7 DNA polymerase, 100 μm ZBD, 10 mm dCTP, and 0.2% Tween 20. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. The binding and elution processes were the same as described above.DNA Binding Assay—The binding of an ssDNA template to the primase was monitored by equilibrium fluorescence anisotropy of a 5′-labeled DNA (the 6-FAM label, see description under “Materials”) recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 525 nm, respectively, in a Photon Techn"
https://openalex.org/W2000337551,"The ataxic mutant mouse stargazer is a null mutant for stargazin, a protein involved in the regulation of cell surface trafficking and synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors. The extreme C terminus of stargazin (sequence, –TTPV), confers high affinity for PDZ domain-containing proteins e.g. PSD-95. Interaction with PDZ proteins enables stargazin to fulfill its role as an AMPA receptor synaptic targeting molecule but is not essential for its ability to influence AMPA receptor trafficking to the neuronal cell surface. Using the yeast-two hybrid approach we screened for proteins that interact with the intracellular C-terminal tail of stargazin. Positive interactors included PDZ domain-containing proteins e.g. SAP97, SAP102, and PIST. Interestingly, light chain 2 of microtubule-associated protein 1 (LC2), which does not contain a PDZ domain, was also a strong interactor. This was shown to be a direct interaction that occurred upstream of the -TTPV sequence of stargazin. Immunoprecipitations of Triton X-100 soluble cerebellar extracts revealed that LC2 is pulled down not only by anti-stargazin antibodies but also anti-GluR2 antibodies suggesting that stargazin and AMPA receptor subunits associate with LC2. Immunopurified full-length, native stargazin was shown to co-associate not only with GluR2 in vivo but also with full-length, native LC2. Indeed, LC2 co-associates with stargazin when part of a tripartite complex comprising LC2-stargazin-GluR2. Since this complex was extracted using Triton X-100 and was devoid of PSD95, SAP97, and actin we postulate that LC2 is involved in trafficking of AMPA receptors in cerebellar neurons before they are anchored at the synapse.

The ataxic and epileptic mutant mouse, stargazer (stg), arose spontaneously as a consequence of a viral insertion of a 6-kb early transposon in intron 2 of the stargazin gene (1Noebels J.L. Qiao X.

The molecular basis for these disparate defects has still to be unequivocally resolved but ultimately these must be direct or downstream consequences of ablated expression of stargazin.

Heterologous co-expression studies showed that stargazin had relatively minor effects on P/Q-, L- and α1L T-type VGCC kinetics and cell surface trafficking (2Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H.

It has recently been shown that the N-type VGCC α1B subunit co-precipitates with immunoprecipitated stargazin from detergent soluble mouse brain (4Sharp III, A.H. Black J.L. Dubel S.J. Sundarraj S. Shen J.-P. Yunker A.M.R. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 599-617Google Scholar). Cerebellar GABAA receptor expression is also severely compromised in stargazer mice (11Thompson C.L. Jalilian Tehrani M.H. Barnes Jr., E.M. Stephenson F.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 60: 282-290Google Scholar, 12Chen L. Bao S. Qiao X. Thompson R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12132-12137Google Scholar). The apparent fickle nature of stargazin associations was compounded when it was shown that it also played an intimate role in the trafficking and synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors to cerebellar granule cell synapses through a VGCC-activity-independent mechanism (13Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Google Scholar). Heterologous expression studies revealed that stargazin co-associates with AMPAR GluR1, -2, and -4 (but not NMDA receptor subunit, NR1) and PDZ domains of postsynaptic density proteins, e.g. PSD-95 (13Chen L.

Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 599-617Google Scholar) have since provided evidence that stargazin complexes with GluR1 in vivo, this has been confirmed and expanded upon by Tomita et al. (15Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Google Scholar) to include GluR2 and GluR4. The stargazin ability to influence recruitment of AMPA receptors to the mossy fiber-cerebellar granule cell synapse is, at least in part, dictated by its C-terminal RRTTPV sequence that confers interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95. The extent to which AMPA receptor subunits are targeted/clustered at synapses in a stargazin-mediated manner appears to be limited by the number of available PSD-95 molecules with which stargazin-AMPAR complexes can interact while the availability of stargazin seems to dictate the extent of surface-trafficked AMPA receptors (14Schnell E. Sizemore M. Karimzadegan S. Chen L. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 13902-13907Google Scholar). It is not yet known, however how stargazin regulates AMPA receptor trafficking, nor whether other stargazin-protein interactions are required for synaptic targeting or synaptic stability of receptors already docked at the synapse. The work described herein shows that stargazin interacts with light chain 2 (LC2) of microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) in vivo and that this complex includes GluR2 but not PSD-95, SAP97, nor actin. LC2 is synthesized from MAP1A mRNA, which is translated to give a precursor protein that is subsequently cleaved into the N-terminal heavy chain (∼270 kDa) and the C-terminal LC2 (∼30 kDa, Ref. 16Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Muller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Google Scholar). The light and heavy chains can associate non-covalently, though it is now considered that the light chain is the biochemically active entity responsible for regulating neuronal differentiation and microtubule dynamics. The heavy chain acts as a light chain regulatory subunit (17Tögel M. Wiche G. Propst F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 695-707Google Scholar, 18Mei X. Sweatt A.J. Hammarback J.A. Brain Res. Bulletin. 2000; 53: 801-806Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that stargazin is involved in a tripartite complex with LC2 and AMPA receptors after exit from the endoplasmic reticulum but prior to, or following incorporation into a synapse. Animals—Wild-type (C3B6Fe+; +/+), heterozygous (C3B6Fe+; +/stg) and homozygous stargazer mutant mice (C3B6Fe+; stg/stg) were obtained from heterozygous breeding pairs originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in the University of Durham vivarium on a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. Animal husbandry, breeding, and procedures performed during these experiments were conducted according to the Scientific Procedures Act 1986. We, in accordance with others (19Qiao X. Hefti F. Knussel B. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 16: 640-648Google Scholar, 20Hashimoto K. Fukaya M. Qiao X. Sakimura K. Watanabe M. Kano M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6027-6036Google Scholar), have found no differences between wild-type (+/+) and heterozygous (+/stg) mice in terms of their phenotype, behavior or any of the molecular entities we have studied. We routinely use, therefore, a mixture of +/+ and +/stg mice brains in our control experiments. New-Zealand White (NZW) rabbits used for polyclonal antibody production were obtained from B & K Universal Ltd. (Hull). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The C-terminal stargazin bait representing amino acid residues 202–323 was constructed by PCR amplification and cloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech). DNA was sequenced from clones to confirm the correct orientation and sequence accuracy. A T7 transcription reaction followed by translation in a rabbit reticulocyte system (TnT, Promega) was performed from the pGBKT7 clone, which has a c-Myc tag inserted upstream of the bait. The expected size protein product was detected by immunoblotting, performed as previously described by Thompson and Stephenson (21Thompson C.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2037-2044Google Scholar). The bait plasmid was introduced into yeast strain AH109 by the lithium acetate-mediated method, a protocol provided by Clontech, which was adapted from Gietz et al. (22Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Google Scholar). The bait was used to screen an adult mouse brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech), constructed in pACT2 and pre-transformed into yeast strain Y187, in a mating reaction, which was plated onto S.D. agar deficient in leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (a low stringency screen). Colonies grew in 3–6 days and were picked and re-screened on high stringency media (S.D. –leucine, tryptophan, histidine, adenine) with the addition of X-α-gal, a chromogenic substrate used to detect α-galactosidase, which is the secreted reporter expressed from the MEL1 gene. Blue colonies from this screen were re-screened on high stringency media to confirm the phenotype. Clone Analysis—DNA was extracted from cultures of each clone by standard methods and then PCR-amplified with pACT2-specific primers (AD-LD Insert Screening Amplimer Set, Clontech). Identical clones were identified by restriction enzyme digest analysis, and hybridization of probes to DNA dot blots (standard methods). To identify PDZ proteins a 2125 bp PSD-95 hybridization probe (encompassing all three PDZ domains the SH3 domain and the guanylate kinase-like domain) was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the primers F (5′-TGTCTCTGTATAGTGACAACCA-3′) and R (5′-AGGTCTTCGATGACACGTTTCA-3′) and applied to DNA dot blots. Identities of clones were established by direct sequencing. Yeast mating assays were performed using constructs and plasmids supplied with the Matchmaker 2 kit (Clontech, methods according to the manufacturer's instructions) to eliminate false positive interacting clones. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (Clontech) was used at 2 μg/ml. Goat anti-LC2 and anti-GluR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were employed at 0.2 μg/ml. Anti-stargazin extreme C terminus-targeted polyclonal antibodies were raised against customsynthesized peptide Cys-DSLHANTANRRTTPV (Stg 309–323; Immune Systems Ltd., Paignton, UK) coupled to thyroglobulin in NZW rabbits. A second anti-stargazin specific antibody was raised to a custom-synthesized peptide sequence Cys-RATDYLQASAITRIPS (Stg 213–228; Immune Systems Ltd.) corresponding to the sequence found in the intracellular C-terminal tail but more proximal to the fourth putative transmembrane domain (TM4). This antibody is subsequently referred to as the TM4 proximal C terminus anti-stargazin antibody. Antibodies were purified on peptide-coupled affinity columns by standard methods (23Ives J.H. Drewery D.L. Thompson C.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 317-327Google Scholar) and used at 1–4 μg/ml. Cloning and Expression of Protein Constructs—LC2 residues 2554–2774, stargazin residues 202–323 (stargazin-full), and stargazin residues 202–317 (stargazin-truncated) were cloned into pENTR/D then recombined into pDEST17 (Invitrogen), which has an N-terminal His6 tag. Constructs were sequenced to confirm their open reading frames, transformed, and then expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-AI. Proteins were purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Invitrogen), and competent expression was verified by immunoblot analysis. Gel Overlay Analysis—Essentially as Wu et al. (24Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Proteins (1 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were then initially immersed in 6 m guanidine-HCl for 10 min at 4 °C followed by six sequential 10 min, 4 °C incubations in 1:1 serially diluted guanidine-HCl (final incubation in 0.09375 m). Filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% (w/v) fat-free skimmed dry milk and 0.3% (v/v) Tween-20 for 30 min. The block was discarded and the filters rinsed twice with incubation buffer (TBS with 0.25% (w/v) milk, 0.3% (v/v) Tween-20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before overnight incubation in the overlay protein at 17–30 μg/ml, at 4 °C in incubation buffer. Filters were washed four times, 10 min each in TBS with 0.3% (v/v) Tween-20, 0.25% (w/v) milk with the second wash also containing 0.0001% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. The presence of overlaid proteins on the filter was detected by immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE Gel Silver Staining—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, gels were fixed by 2× immersion for 15 min in fixative (10% (v/v) acetic acid: 40% (v/v) methanol) followed by 30 min in 250 ml of sensitizer (30% methanol, 13 mm sodium thiosulfate, 83 mm sodium acetate). Gels were then washed 3× 5 min in H2O and then exposed to 15 mm silver nitrate for 20 min. Following 2× 1-min washes in H2O, gels were exposed to developer (24 mm sodium carbonate, 0.15% (v/v) formaldehyde in 250 ml H2O) until silver-stained protein bands emerged. Development was terminated by addition of a saturated aqueous solution of EDTA. Immunoaffinity Purification of Stargazin—Adult mouse cerebella from control (+/+ and +/stg) and stargazer mice were rapidly dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 C until required. Cerebellar membrane homogenates of both sets of tissue were simultaneously prepared according to Kannenberg et al. (25Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella were rapidly thawed and homogenized in buffer A comprising 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml) and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), all at 4 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 45,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C. The pellets were rehomogenized in buffer A supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, stirred for 30 min at 4 °C before ultracentrifugation at 147,000 × g for 75 min, 4 °C. The Triton X-100 soluble material was passed through glass wool before being applied to separate, but identical, anti-stargazin antibody-coupled agarose gels (1.5-ml bed volume, hereafter termed the immunoaffinity columns) in 15-ml conical tubes and incubated with agitation, overnight at 4 °C. The gels were poured into 15-ml Bio-Rad columns. Unbound material was allowed to elute off the column and was collected for analysis (flow-through). The immunoaffinity columns were subsequently washed with 50-column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100. Antibody-bound proteins were eluted from the respective columns by one of the following methods. Acid Elution—Proteins were eluted with acid elution buffer comprising 50 mm glycine pH 2.3, 500 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. 1-ml fractions were collected in Eppendorf tubes and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris. Peptide Elution—To test for the specificity of association of proteins with the immunoaffinity columns and specificity of elution, peptide whose sequence matched part of the extracellular domain of stargazin (CKTKSVSENETSK) and thus not competitive for the stargazin-anti-stargazin antibody binding sequences on the two different anti-stargazin antibody immunoaffinity columns was applied (0.5 mm, 4 ml), with circulation, to the immunoaffinity columns in buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitors, 10% sucrose (w/v), and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 12 h at 4 °C. The column eluate was collected, and the columns subsequently washed with 10 ml of buffer A as above and then the respective peptide, used as antigen to raise the anti-stargazin antibodies coupled to the immunoaffinity columns, was applied as for the nonspecific peptide above. After 12 h of circulation through the column, the eluate was collected. The column was subsequently washed with 10 ml of Buffer A supplemented with sucrose (10%, w/v) and Triton X-100 (1%, v/v) before being subjected to the acid-elution protocol above to elucidate whether all proteins had been displaced from the column and to displace peptide so the columns could be used again. Immunoprecipitations—Stargazin and associated proteins purified by immunoaffinity column chromatography and acid eluted as above was prepared for immunoprecipitation studies by first incubating with the stargazin C-terminal peptide (0.5 mm) to compete out the interaction of stargazin with the anti-stargazin antibody that leached off the immunoaffinity column by the acid elution protocol. This preparation was precleared with EZview Red protein G affinity gel (Sigma) and then dialyzed against IP buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) plus 10% (w/v) sucrose). In the immunoprecipitation reaction, purified stargazin or Triton X-100 solubilized cerebellar membranes were combined with 10–20 μl of anti-LC2, anti-stargazin or anti-GluR2 antibodies, in 1-ml reactions in IP buffer with protease inhibitors (aprotinin, 2 μg/ml; pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml; leupeptin 1 μg/ml, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were incubated with EZview Red protein G affinity gel, pelleted, washed, and the protein complexes eluted with 50 mm glycine pH 2.5. Neutralized samples were prepared for immunoblotting. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) employing bovine serum albumin as standard for calibration. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen: the C Terminus Stargazin Bait Interacts with Both PDZ and Non-PDZ Domain-containing Proteins—The fidelity of PCR amplification of our stargazin bait was confirmed by DNA sequencing. We confirmed that we had subcloned the bait sequence in-frame by in vitro translating the construct and analyzing the product by immunoblotting using antibodies recognizing the N terminus c-Myc sequence and the extreme C terminus of stargazin. A unique immunopositive band was identified with both antibodies that had the identical, predicted molecular size (21 kDa). These bands were not detected when empty vector was analyzed in the same way (Fig. 1). The bait sequence is depicted in Fig. 2A.Fig. 2Schematic representations of stargazin and MAPIA proteins. A, schematic representation of the stargazin protein. The position of the four predicted transmembrane domains of stargazin are indicated (I, residues 11–29; II, residues 106–124; III, residues 134–155; IV, residues 180–202: Ref. 2Letts V.A. Felix R.

The domain of stargazin that confers its ability to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins is shown as a shaded box. Below is the region used as the stargazin bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Also shown are the two protein expression constructs used in the gel overlay assays. The region of interaction of stargazin is narrowed to residues 202–317. B, schematic of the MAP1A polyprotein. The positions of the self-similarity 1 and 2 domains (SS1, SS2), and the guanylate kinase binding site (GK) are indicated (31Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Google Scholar). Light chain 2 (LC2) spans residues 2465–2774. The shortest LC2-like clone found by yeast two-hybrid is indicated as is the region used in the protein expression construct; from this analysis the region of interaction with stargazin is narrowed to residues 2554–2774.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify stargazin C terminus interacting proteins we screened a mouse brain cDNA library with the C-terminal bait. A total of 5.5 × 106 clones were screened. By low stringency auxotrophic challenge, 600 interacting clones were identified. Following re-screening on high stringency media, the number of positive interacting clones was reduced to 129. Identical clones were identified by restriction enzyme digest analysis and some overlapping clones were identified by dot blot hybridizations (data not shown). Since the extreme C-terminal amino acid sequence of stargazin confers a consensus high affinity binding site for PDZ domain-containing proteins we used a PSD-95 hybridization probe in dot blot screens to identify the presence of PDZ domain containing clones. PDZ domain-containing proteins were indeed identified among the group of strong interactors. Sequence analysis revealed the identity of the clones, and a list of proteins represented by 34 independent clones is shown in Table I. Following yeast mating analyses (see “Experimental Procedures” Clone Analysis), three of these strong positive interacting clones, representing Na+/K+ ATPase β-polypeptide, axonal-associated cell adhesion molecule (BIG-2) and protein phosphatase-3, were eliminated from further studies as these failed this secondary round of screening. Those strong interactors that passed the yeast mating screens comprised the PDZ domain-containing proteins SAP97, SAP102, and PIST. Two proteins that do not contain PDZ domains were also recognized as stargazin interactors. Three clones of microtubule-associated protein 1A light chain 2 (LC2) were identified as strong interactors. A single clone of microtubule-associated protein 1B light chain 1 (LC1) was also identified and also survived the yeast mating secondary screening analyses, however, based on the time this clone took to grow and express α-galactosidase activity we considered this to be a weaker interaction.Table IStargazin C terminus bait interacting proteins detected by yeast two-hybrid assaysProteinNumber of independent clonesOutcome of yeast matingMAP1A-LC23PassedMAP1B-LC11PassedSAP971PassedSAP1021PassedPIST1PassedNa+/K+ ATPase β-polypeptide18FailedAxonal-associated cell adhesion molecule (BIG-2)4FailedProtein phosphatase 31Failed Open table in a new tab Stargazin Interacts with the Light Chains of Microtubule-associated Proteins—Sequence analysis of the three stargazin-interacting LC2 clones and the single LC1 clone revealed that association was through a common conserved sequence of their light chain (LC) regions. The shortest LC2 clone identified from the screen extended from amino acid residue 2550 to 2774 (Fig. 2B), and the only LC1 clone to be pulled out of the library screen extended from residue 2233, equivalent to residue 2570 of LC2 when their sequences are aligned (16Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Muller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Google Scholar), to residue 2774. As the LC1 clone was twenty residues shorter than the shortest LC2 domain, we assumed these residues were unlikely to contribute to the interacting domain and therefore felt justified in omitting the 12 base pairs coding for the first four amino acids of LC2, thus making it easier to create the LC construct for in vitro translation. Since the yeast two-hybrid screen detected only one LC1 clone but three LC2 clones as stargazin interactors (Table I) and that the LC1 clone-stargazin bait yeast hybrid grew more slowly on high stringency media than the LC2 clones (data not shown) implying a weaker interaction in the former case, we subsequently used the LC2 sequence for further investigation. The LC2 Domain and the Stargazin Bait Interaction Is Direct, Is Preserved Outside of the Yeast System, and It Is Independent of the PDZ Domain-interacting Sequence of Stargazin—We next investigated whether the stargazin C-terminal domain and LC2 interacted directly with each other, and whether this had some significance outside of the yeast two-hybrid system. The interacting domains were expressed in E. coli, purified, and then analyzed for their ability to interact using the gel overlay approach. Fig. 3A confirms the strict specificity of the anti-stargazin and anti-LC2 antibodies for their intended targets. Our extreme C terminus anti-stargazin antibody recognizes both the full-length and truncated versions of stargazin (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) but does not cross-react with the LC2 domain (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Likewise, the anti-LC2 antibody recognizes the LC2 construct (Fig. 3A, lane 4) and does not cross-react with the full-length or truncated version of stargazin devoid of the PDZ-interacting domain (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). When the in vitro translated stargazin bait protein was used to overlay the LC2 construct the anti-stargazin antibody recognized its substrate at a molecular weight corresponding to that of the LC2 construct, i.e. the stargazin C terminus construct interacted with the LC2 domain (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Likewise, when this was performed in reverse, i.e. the LC2 protein was used to overlay both the full-length and truncated stargazin bait proteins, anti-LC2 antibody immunoreactivity was identified at the mass of the stargazin constructs (Fig 3B, lanes 2 and 3), confirming that the stargazin C terminus protein and the LC2 domain specifically and directly interact with each other outside of the yeast system and do so independently of the PDZ domain"
https://openalex.org/W2002331449,"Allergic diseases such as asthma are characterized by tissue eosinophilia induced by the combined effects of chemoattractants and cytokines. Lipid mediators are a major class of endogenous chemoattractants, among which 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) is the most potent for human eosinophils. In this study, we investigated the effects of 5-oxo-ETE on eosinophil survival by flow cytometry. We found that this compound could promote eosinophil survival in the presence of small numbers of contaminating monocytes, but not in their absence. The conditioned medium from monocytes treated for 24 h with 5-oxo-ETE also strongly promoted eosinophil survival, whereas the medium from vehicle-treated monocytes had no effect. An antibody against the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) completely blocked the response of eosinophils to the conditioned medium from 5-oxo-ETE-treated monocytes, whereas an antibody against interleukin-5 had no effect. Furthermore, 5-oxo-ETE stimulated the release of GM-CSF from cultured monocytes in amounts compatible with eosinophil survival activity, with a maximal effect being observed after 24 h. This effect was concentration-dependent and could be observed at concentrations in the picomolar range. 5-Oxo-ETE and leukotriene B4 had similar effects on GM-CSF release at low concentrations, but 5-oxo-ETE induced a much stronger response at concentrations of 10 nm or higher. This is the first report that 5-oxo-ETE can induce the release of any cytokine, suggesting that it could be an important mediator in allergic and other inflammatory diseases due both to its chemoattractant properties and to its potent effects on the synthesis of the survival factor GM-CSF.

Pronounced tissue eosinophilia is a hallmark of a number of diseases, including allergic disorders such as asthma and rhinitis and parasitic infections (1Rothenberg M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). In asthmatic subjects, increased numbers of eosinophils are found in the airways following exposure to allergens (2Bousquet J. Jeffery P.K. Busse W.W. Johnson M. Vignola A.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 1720-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). Pulmonary eosinophils are believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma through the release of cationic granule proteins, reactive oxygen metabolites, lipid mediators, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (3Martin L.B. Kita H. Leiferman K.M. Gleich G.J. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1996; 109: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition to eliciting tissue damage, eosinophil-derived mediators can perpetuate the inflammatory reaction and lead to chronic changes in airway function (3Martin L.B. Kita H. Leiferman K.M. Gleich G.J. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1996; 109: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Accumulation of eosinophils in inflammatory sites is thought to be mediated by a number of factors. Following mobilization from bone marrow in response to cytokines, eosinophils migrate into the lung and other tissues in response to the release of locally produced chemoattractants. Certain lipid mediators, most notably products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and platelet-activating factor, are potent stimulators of this process (4Giembycz M.A. Lindsay M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 213-340PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-induced pulmonary eosinophilia is dramatically reduced in mice lacking the 5-lipoxygenase gene (5Irvin C.G. Tu Y.P. Sheller J.R. Funk C.D. Am. J.

The accumulation of eosinophils in tissues is dependent not only on their migration from the blood, but also on their survival within the tissue, as these cells are normally quite short-lived and rapidly undergo apoptosis (23Simon H.U. Allergy (Cph.). 2000; 55: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of the potent effects of 5-oxo-ETE on eosinophils, the aim of this study was to determine whether it can also promote the survival of these cells. Reagents—5-Oxo-ETE was prepared by total chemical synthesis (24Khanapure S.P. Shi X.X. Powell W.S. Rokach J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 337-342Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was a gift from Merck Frosst. Recombinant human interleukin-5 (IL-5), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), eotaxin, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) were purchased from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against recombinant human IL-5 and recombinant human GM-CSF were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polymyxin B were purchased from Sigma. The polyclonal antibody to human LPS-binding protein was obtained from Cedarlane (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Preparation of Eosinophils—Granulocytes were prepared from heparinized whole blood collected from healthy volunteers in Vacutainer blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences). No attempt was made to separate atopic from non-atopic donors, although none had asthma. Red blood cells were removed using dextran T-500 (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and mononuclear cells by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (25Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1968; 21: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). Any remaining red blood cells were then removed by hypotonic lysis. Finally, neutrophils and monocytes were removed from the resulting granulocyte preparation by treatment with a mixture of anti-CD16 (26Hansel T.T. De Vries I.J. Iff T. Rihs S. Wandzilak M. Betz S.

Eosinophils, contained in the passthrough fraction, were washed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. The purity of eosinophils, as determined using a laser-based flow cytometer (CELL-DYN 3700 system), was 94 ± 1%, the contaminating cells being neutrophils (4.6 ± 0.9%) and lymphocytes (1.4 ± 0.6%). No monocytes were detected in these preparations. Eosinophil viability was >99% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Preparation of Monocytes—Monocytes were purified from normal donors using a monocyte isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotec Inc., which permits negative selection of monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by immunomagnetic depletion of T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and basophils. Briefly, mononuclear cells were isolated from diluted heparinized peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (d 1.077). The mononuclear cells were then incubated with a mixture of hapten-conjugated antibodies against CD3, CD7, CD19, CD45RA, CD56, and IgE, followed by incubation with anti-hapten microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) as described by the supplier. Monocytes were obtained in the passthrough fraction following immunomagnetic cell sorting using the MACS column as described above. The purity of monocytes (88 ± 2%) was determined using the CELL-DYN 3700 system. Viability was >99% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Conditioned Medium from Monocytes—Monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in macrophage serum-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence or absence of 5-oxo-ETE (1 μm, unless otherwise indicated) for 24 h at 37 °C. The conditioned medium was collected following centrifugation of the cells and was stored at –20 °C until used. In some experiments, the conditioned medium was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with saturating concentrations of neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IL-5 (20 μg/ml) or GM-CSF (20 μg/ml) prior to addition to monocyte-depleted eosinophils. Assessment of Eosinophil Survival—Purified eosinophils were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Eosinophils (2 × 105 cells/200 μl) were incubated in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at 37 °C for 48 h in the presence or absence of agonists or the conditioned medium from monocytes in the presence of humidified air containing 5% CO2. Eosinophil survival was analyzed by flow cytometry using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V/propidium iodide staining kit (R&D Systems). In brief, cells were removed from each well by gentle pipetting. To confirm that all the cells were removed, the wells were examined using an inverted microscope. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, the cells were gently resuspended and incubated with FITC-labeled annexin V (0.25 μg) and propidium iodide (0.5 μg) in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed within 1 h by flow cytometry using a FACS-Calibur instrument with Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Cell viability is expressed as the percentage of total cells that were not stained with either FITC-labeled annexin V or propidium iodide. Quantitation of GM-CSF in Conditioned Medium—GM-CSF concentrations in the conditioned medium from monocytes were determined using a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA), which uses the multiple sandwich technique. GM-CSF was detectable in the linear portion of the binding curve (7–250 pg/ml), which was determined using recombinant human GM-CSF. Statistics—The results are presented as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance of the differences between various treatments was assessed using one- or two-way analysis of variance, followed by the Tukey test for post-hoc analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. 5-Oxo-ETE Induces Monocyte-dependent Survival of Eosinophils—Eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque, followed by immunomagnetic cell sorting of the granulocyte fraction using anti-CD16 antibody coupled to paramagnetic microbeads to remove neutrophils. These cells were treated with either vehicle or 5-oxo-ETE (1 μm) for 48 h in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, and the numbers of live cells were determined by flow cytometry following labeling with annexin V and propidium iodide. As shown in Fig. 1A (lower left quadrant, unstained cells), only 23% of the vehicle-treated cells remained alive, with the remainder of the cells being either apoptotic (lower right quadrant, annexin V+/propidium iodide–) or apoptotic/necrotic (upper right quadrant, annexin V+/propidium iodide+). In contrast, 71% of the 5-oxo-ETE-treated cells remained alive after 48 h (Fig. 1B, lower left quadrant). Examination of a larger number of subjects revealed that 5-oxo-ETE significantly increased eosinophil survival from 27 ± 5 in vehicle-treated eosinophils to 50 ± 10% (p < 0.01) compared with 83 ± 5% in cells treated with the eosinophil survival factor IL-5 (Fig. 2, left). However, there was considerable variability in the responses of different eosinophil preparations to 5-oxo-ETE, with some showing virtually no response. In contrast, all preparations tested responded well to IL-5. This raised the possibility that the effect of 5-oxo-ETE was mediated by the release of an eosinophil survival factor from small numbers of contaminating cells. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the two cell preparations that displayed virtually no response to 5-oxo-ETE contained no detectable monocytes, whereas each of the five eosinophil preparations that responded to 5-oxo-ETE was contaminated with at least 1% monocytes (3.2 ± 1.6%). We confirmed that monocytes were responsible for the survival-enhancing effects of 5-oxo-ETE by removing these cells from our eosinophil preparations using anti-CD14 antibody coupled to paramagnetic beads. This resulted in a nearly complete loss of the effect of 5-oxo-ETE on eosinophil survival without any reduction in the response to IL-5, which acted directly on these cells (Fig. 2, right). Monocytes Secrete a Soluble Eosinophil Survival Factor in Response to 5-Oxo-ETE—Monocytes purified immunomagnetically by negative selection were incubated with either vehicle or 5-oxo-ETE (1 μm) for 24 h. Aliquots of the conditioned medium from monocytes from a single donor were then incubated for 48 h with monocyte-depleted eosinophils from four different donors, and cell survival was assessed by flow cytometry. As described above, 5-oxo-ETE added directly to the four eosinophil preparations had only a small, statistically non-significant effect on cell survival, whereas IL-5 dramatically increased survival (Fig. 3A, open bars). In contrast, the conditioned medium from 5-oxo-ETE-treated monocytes strongly stimulated eosinophil survival (67 ± 10%; p < 0.001) to almost the same extent as the direct addition of IL-5, whereas the conditioned medium from vehicle-treated monocytes had no detectable effect (11 ± 4%). This experiment clearly demonstrates that different eosinophil preparations respond consistently to a 5-oxo-ETE-inducible factor released by monocytes. Therefore, for statistical purposes, for all of the experiments described below, n was taken to be the number of different monocyte preparations tested against one or more eosinophil preparations. To determine the potency of 5-oxo-ETE in inducing the release of the monocyte-derived survival factor, four different preparations of monocytes were incubated separately with different concentrations of 5-oxo-ETE for 24 h. The conditioned media were then incubated with monocyte-depleted eosinophils from a single donor for 48 h. 5-Oxo-ETE (EC50 = 5.8 ± 2.1 nm) potently induced the release of the eosinophil survival factor (Fig. 3B). This effect was consistently observed with monocytes from different donors. As LPS has also been shown to induce the monocyte-dependent survival of eosinophils (27Meerschaert J. Busse W.W. Bertics P.J. Mosher D.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we wanted to ensure that the response we observed was not an artifact due to contamination with this substance. We therefore conducted experiments in which either polymyxin B, which binds to the lipid A portion of LPS (28Morrison D.C. Jacobs D.M. Immunochemistry. 1976; 13: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), or an antibody to LPS-binding protein was added to the conditioned medium from monocytes. Neither of these substances had any effect on either basal eosinophil survival or the survival-enhancing effect of 5-oxo-ETE (Fig. 4). In contrast, both inhibitors nearly completely blocked the increase in eosinophil survival elicited by incubation with the conditioned medium from monocytes that had been treated with LPS for 24 h (p < 0.001). The Monocyte-derived Eosinophil Survival Factor Induced by 5-Oxo-ETE Is Identical to GM-CSF—Because both IL-5 and GM-CSF are known to be potent eosinophil survival factors (1Rothenberg M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), we determined whether the effects of 5-oxo-ETE could be prevented by blocking antibodies to these two cytokines. To test the efficacy of the antibodies, monocyte-depleted eosinophils were incubated with IL-5 or GM-CSF in the presence or absence of anti-IL-5 or anti-GM-CSF antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 (left), these antibodies nearly completely abolished the responses mediated by their respective antigens (p < 0.001). In contrast, a control isotype-matched antibody had no effect on the survival of either vehicle- or cytokine-treated monocytes (data not shown). To determine whether these antibodies could block the effects of 5-oxo-ETE, the conditioned medium from 5-oxo-ETE-treated monocytes was treated with either anti-IL-5 or anti-GM-CSF antibody. As described above, the conditioned medium from 5-oxo-ETE-treated monocytes strongly induced eosinophil survival (p < 0.001). This effect was completely abrogated by the addition of anti-GM-CSF antibody (p < 0.001), but was unaffected by anti-IL-5 antibody (Fig. 5, right), providing strong evidence that the effect of 5-oxo-ETE is mediated by GM-CSF. 5-Oxo-ETE Stimulates Monocytes to Produce GM-CSF—To provide direct evidence that 5-oxo-ETE can induce GM-CSF release from monocytes, we measured its concentration following incubation of these cells with 5-oxo-ETE (1 μm) for different times (Fig. 6A). 5-Oxo-ETE strongly stimulated GM-CSF release from monocytes, with the maximal level of this cytokine being observed after 24 h (p < 0.01). The effects of concentrations of 5-oxo-ETE between 1 pm and 100 nm on GM-CSF release from monocytes are shown in Fig. 6B. The effect of 5-oxo-ETE was concentration-dependent, with significant increases occurring at subnanomolar concentrations. However, the maximal response was not reached within this concentration range. The effects of higher concentrations of 5-oxo-ETE are shown in Fig. 6B (inset). The greatest response (15.3 ± 2.9 versus 0.36 ± 0.14 pm GM-CSF in vehicle-treated cells) was observed at 10 μm 5-oxo-ETE, but it was not clear whether a plateau had been reached even at this concentration. The effects of LTB4 on GM-CSF release were also investigated, but only a limited number of concentrations could be tested because of the small numbers of monocytes available. Concentrations of LTB4 and 5-oxo-ETE in the picomolar range had similar effects on GM-CSF production, whereas 5-oxo-ETE induced a much greater response at higher concentrations (Fig. 6B). To ensure that the concentrations of GM-CSF in the conditioned medium obtained from 5-oxo-ETE-treated monocytes were sufficient to prolong eosinophil survival, we incubated eosinophils with various concentrations of recombinant human GM-CSF and measured the numbers of surviving cells after 48 h. As shown in Fig. 6C, the EC50 value for the effect of GM-CSF on eosinophil survival was ∼0.37 pm. The concentration of GM-CSF in the medium from monocytes cultured with 1 μm 5-oxo-ETE was 7.44 ± 1.19 pm, whereas the concentration in medium from vehicle-treated cells was 0.68 ± 0.15 pm (means of data from Fig. 6, A and B). However, as the conditioned medium from monocytes was diluted 20-fold in the eosinophil survival studies shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, this would give final concentrations of ∼0.37 and 0.034 pm GM-CSF (Fig. 6C, arrows) following the addition of aliquots of the conditioned media from 5-oxo-ETE- and vehicle-treated monocytes, respectively. Our preliminary results suggested that 5-oxo-ETE is capable of prolonging the survival of eosinophils. However, the variability of this response led us to suspect that it may be indirect, possibly mediated by small numbers of contaminating cells. The complete absence of monocytes in the two eosinophil preparations that failed to respond to 5-oxo-ETE suggested that these cells might be required for its survival-enhancing effect. This was confirmed when we found that 5-oxo-ETE was unable to promote survival in preparations of eosinophils from which all of the monocytes had been removed by treatment with anti-CD14 antibody. The medium from purified monocytes incubated with 5-oxo-ETE for 24 h strongly stimulated eosinophil survival to nearly the same extent as IL-5, a well known eosinophil survival factor, indicating that this effect was mediated by the release of a soluble factor from monocytes. This effect was quite reproducible, as it was consistently observed using both eosinophils and monocytes from many different donors. As the most likely candidates for the soluble factor released by 5-oxo-ETE appeared to be GM-CSF and IL-5, we tested the effects of monoclonal antibodies against these two cytokines. Anti-GM-CSF antibody completely blocked the survival-enhancing effect of the conditioned medium from 5-oxo-ETE-treated monocytes, whereas anti-IL-5 antibody was without effect. Furthermore, 5-oxo-ETE was a potent stimulator of GM-CSF release from monocytes. Incubation of monocytes with 1 μm 5-oxo-ETE induced the release of GM-CSF in concentrations equivalent to its EC50 value after dilution in the medium used to culture eosinophils in survival studies. The base-line levels of GM-CSF in the medium from vehicle-treated monocytes were >10 times lower and would be expected to elicit only a small increase in eosinophil survival. These results provide compelling evidence that GM-CSF can account for most, if not all, of the eosinophil survival-promoting activity released from monocytes in response to 5-oxo-ETE. The concentration-response curve for 5-oxo-ETE-induced GM-CSF production did not reach a plateau, and it was not clear whether the maximal response had been achieved, even at a concentration as high as 10 μm. This may be due to the metabolism of 5-oxo-ETE over the relatively long 24-h incubation period, which could have limited the response to lower concentrations of this substance. When present at higher concentrations, biologically effective levels of 5-oxo-ETE could have persisted for a much longer period of time, thus enhancing its effect on GM-CSF production and skewing the concentration-response curve. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that the effects of 5-oxo-ETE are mediated by its conversion to an active metabolite during the 24-h incubation period with monocytes. Murine macrophages convert 5-oxo-ETE to both ω-oxidation products (15Hevko J.M. Bowers R.C. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar) and 5-oxo-7-glutathionyl-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, a glutathionyl conjugate, the formation of which is catalyzed by LTC4 synthase (29Hevko J.M. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7037-7043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 5-Oxo-7-glutathionyl-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid is known to stimulate migration and actin polymerization in human eosinophils, and it is not known whether it also has other effects on these cells (30Bowers R.C. Hevko J. Henson P.M. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29931-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, unlike murine macrophages, human monocytes do not appear to have high levels of ω-oxidation activity (14Zhang Y. Styhler A. Powell W.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); and at least in short-term incubations (30 min), we have not detected significant amounts of any 5-oxo-ETE metabolites formed by these cells. This is the first report that 5-oxo-ETE can stimulate the release of a cytokine from any target cell, as until now, it had only been shown to elicit fairly rapid responses such as actin polymerization, calcium mobilization, and adhesion molecule expression (16Czech W. Barbisch M. Tenscher K. Schopf E. Schröder J.M. Norgauer J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 108-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17O'Flaherty J.T. Kuroki M. Nixon A.B. Wijkander J. Yee E. Lee S.L. Smitherman P.K. Wykle R.L. Daniel L.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar, 18Powell W.S. Gravel S. Halwani F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which are associated with functional responses such as cell adhesion and migration (9Powell W.S. Chung D. Gravel S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4123-4132PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that LTB4 can induce GM-CSF release from monocytes, but the maximal response was much lower than that elicited by 5-oxo-ETE. LTB4 has also been shown to stimulate monocytes to release interleukin-6 (31Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. Blood. 1992; 80: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the present study appears to be the first direct evidence that a 5-lipoxygenase product can induce the release of GM-CSF. Antagonists of the cys-LT1 receptor have been reported to inhibit GM-CSF release from antigen-stimulated mononuclear cells from asthmatics (32Tohda Y. Nakahara H. Kubo H. Haraguchi R. Fukuoka M. Nakajima S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 1532-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Becler K. Hakansson L. Rak S. Allergy (Cph.). 2002; 57: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the effect of LTD4 itself on these cells was not reported, and the precise mechanism of action of cys-LT1 antagonists in this mixed cell population is not well understood. 5-Oxo-ETE has weak chemotactic effects on monocytes and enhances their response to MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein) and MCP-3 (34Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Bernasconi S. Luini W. Mantovani A. O'Flaherty J.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4664-4671PubMed Google Scholar). It also induces actin polymerization in these cells, but, in contrast to eosinophils, does not elicit calcium mobilization (34Sozzani S. Zhou D. Locati M. Bernasconi S. Luini W. Mantovani A. O'Flaherty J.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4664-4671PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages have been shown to contain mRNA for the recently cloned 5-oxo-ETE receptor, although at a lower level than eosinophils and neutrophils (22Jones C.E. Holden S. Tenaillon L. Bhatia U. Seuwen K. Tranter P. Turner J. Kettle R. Bouhelal R. Charlton S. Nirmala N.R. Jarai G. Finan P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that this receptor may also be present in monocytes and may mediate the effects of 5-oxo-ETE on GM-CSF release from these cells. 5-Oxo-ETE occupies a distinct position among eosinophil chemoattractants in that it is a potent stimulus for cell migration and, through its effects on monocyte GM-CSF release, can also promote eosinophil survival. In contrast, the potent eosinophil chemoattractants eotaxin and RANTES do not prolong eosinophil survival (35Iversen P.O. Robinson D. Ying S. Meng Q. Kay A.B. Clark-Lewis I. Lopez A.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), even in the presence of contaminating monocytes (data not shown). The lipid mediator platelet-activating factor, another eosinophil chemoattractant, also fails to promote eosinophil survival (36Matsumoto K. Schleimer R.P. Saito H. Iikura Y. Bochner B.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another eicosanoid with eosinophil chemoattractant activity is prostaglandin D2, which acts through the DP2 receptor/CRTH2 (37Hirai H. Tanaka K. Yoshie O. Ogawa K. Kenmotsu K. Takamori Y. Ichimasa M. Sugamura K. Nakamura M. Takano S. Nagata K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 38Monneret G. Gravel S. Diamond M. Rokach J. Powell W.S. Blood. 2001; 98: 1942-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, this substance does not promote eosinophil survival, despite the fact that the selective DP1 receptor agonist BW245C does have this effect (39Gervais F.G. Cruz R.P. Chateauneuf A. Gale S. Sawyer N. Nantel F. Metters K.M. O'neill G.P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 108: 982-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), presumably due to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, an effect shared by prostaglandin E2 (40Peacock C.D. Misso N.L. Watkins D.N. Thompson P.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: 153-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The present findings have significant implications regarding the potential role of 5-oxo-ETE in asthma, as GM-CSF is known to be very important for the survival of eosinophils once they have reached the lung (41Park C.S. Choi Y.S. Ki S.Y. Moon S.H. Jeong S.W. Uh S.T. Kim Y.H. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 5-Oxo-ETE is synthesized by both monocytes (14Zhang Y. Styhler A. Powell W.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and macrophages (15Hevko J.M. Bowers R.C. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar), which are prominent cells in the lung, and it could act on these cells to release GM-CSF. In this way, 5-oxo-ETE could both elicit the infiltration of eosinophils into the lung in concert with other chemoattractants such as eotaxin, with which it has a synergistic effect (42Powell W.S. Ahmed S. Gravel S. Rokach J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 272-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and increase the lifetime of these eosinophils once they have entered the tissue. It is also possible that 5-oxo-ETE could promote the survival of other inflammatory cells by this mechanism because of the potent effects of GM-CSF on neutrophils and monocytes (43Metcalf D. Science. 1985; 229: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Another intriguing possibility is that GM-CSF, produced in response to 5-oxo-ETE, could act in a feed-forward loop to enhance both the production of and cellular responses to 5-oxo-ETE. GM-CSF has been shown to increase the production of 5-lipoxygenase products at multiple levels in neutrophils (44DiPersio J.F. Billing P. Williams R. Gasson J.C. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4315-4322PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pouliot M. McDonald P.P. Khamzina L. Borgeat P. McColl S.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 851-858PubMed Google Scholar, 46Pouliot M. McDonald P.P. Borgeat P. McColl S.R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and would be expected to stimulate 5-oxo-ETE synthesis in a similar fashion. Furthermore, GM-CSF substantially enhances the responsiveness of both eosinophils (17O'Flaherty J.T. Kuroki M. Nixon A.B. Wijkander J. Yee E. Lee S.L. Smitherman P.K. Wykle R.L. Daniel L.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophils (47O'Flaherty J.T. Kuroki M. Nixon A.B. Wijkander J. Yee E. Lee S.L. Smitherman P.K. Wykle R.L. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17821-17828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to 5-oxo-ETE. In conclusion, 5-oxo-ETE can prolong the survival of eosinophils by stimulating monocytes to release the potent survival factor GM-CSF. Interaction of 5-oxo-ETE with monocytes/macrophages to release GM-CSF could have important implications in diseases such as asthma, as GM-CSF is known to be very important for the survival of eosinophils once they have reached the lung (41Park C.S. Choi Y.S. Ki S.Y. Moon S.H. Jeong S.W. Uh S.T. Kim Y.H. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), in contrast to IL-5, which appears be more important for mobilization of eosinophils from bone marrow (1Rothenberg M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1592-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because of the potent effects of GM-CSF on other inflammatory cells, 5-oxo-ETE could also be implicated in other diseases such as arthritis and atherosclerosis, which are characterized by the accumulation of neutrophils (48Edwards S.W. Hallett M.B. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and monocytes (49Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19343) Google Scholar) in joints and arteries, respectively. The potent effects of 5-oxo-ETE on the migration of eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes, along with its survival-enhancing effects, suggest that this substance may be an important mediator in a variety of inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1971920483,"Mcm10 (Dna43) is an essential protein for the initiation of DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, we identified a human Mcm10 homolog and found that it is regulated by proteolysis and phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner and that it binds chromatin exclusively during the S phase of the cell cycle. However, the precise roles that Mcm10 plays are still unknown. To study the localization dynamics of human Mcm10, we established HeLa cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Mcm10. From early to mid-S phase, GFP-Mcm10 appeared in discrete nuclear foci. In early S phase, several hundred foci appeared throughout the nucleus. In mid-S phase, the foci appeared at the nuclear periphery and nucleolar regions. In the late S and G phases, GFP-Mcm10 was localized to nucleoli. Although 2the distributions of GFP-Mcm10 during the S phase resembled those of replication foci, GFP-Mcm10 foci did not colocalize with sites of DNA synthesis in most cases. Furthermore, the transition of GFP-Mcm10 distribution patterns preceded changes in replication foci patterns or proliferating cell nuclear antigen foci patterns by 30–60 min. These results suggest that human Mcm10 is temporarily recruited to the replication sites 30–60 min before they replicate and that it dissociates from chromatin after the activation of the prereplication complex.

To maintain the integrity of the genome, eukaryotic DNA replication is tightly regulated to ensure that the initiation of replication occurs only once per cell cycle. Recent analyses using different systems show that eukaryotes share a common mechanism that coordinates the initiation of DNA replication from a large number of origins (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar). The initiation of DNA replication consists of two steps, namely the formation of a prereplication complex (pre-RC) 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, prereplication complex; Orc, origin recognition complex; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; CSK, cytoskeleton; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole-dihydrochrolide. 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, prereplication complex; Orc, origin recognition complex; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; CSK, cytoskeleton; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole-dihydrochrolide. and the activation of pre-RC. The pre-RC is formed by the sequential assembly of the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (Orc), Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Mcm2-7 complex on chromatin in telophase (1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar, 2Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Google Scholar, 3Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Google Scholar). This process is also referred to as replication licensing. At the G1/S transition, the pre-RC is activated by S phase cyclin-dependent kinases and the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase, which mediate the association of Cdc45 to a preformed pre-RC at each origin with programmed timing (4Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9130-9135Google Scholar, 5Zou L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3086-3096Google Scholar, 6Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39773-39778Google Scholar). Subsequent to Cdc45 loading, the DNA is unwound at the replication origin (7Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar) and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (RPA) and DNA polymerases are recruited (7Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar, 8Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Google Scholar). Eukaryotes have several means to prevent the reinitiation from origins in the S, G2, and M phases. For example, cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylates Cdc6 and causes either its degradation (yeast) or export from the nucleus (mammalian cells), which ensures that the pre-RC is not reassembled until the segregation of chromosomes in mitosis (9Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Google Scholar, 10Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. How Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Google Scholar). Moreover, Cdt1 is regulated by its expression levels and by its interaction with geminin, which guarantee that it is only functional in the G1 phase (11Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Google Scholar, 12Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Google Scholar). Mcm10 was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in screens for genes that are required for chromosomal DNA replication (13Solomon N.A. Wright M.B. Chang S. Buckley A.M. Dumas L.B. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1992; 8: 273-289Google Scholar, 14Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Google Scholar). Studies in S. cerevisiae suggest that Mcm10 plays multiple roles in DNA replication. mcm10 mutants suffer a defect in the initiation of DNA replication (14Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Google Scholar). In the mcm10-1 mutant, the replication forks stall when the replication machinery passes through origins that did not fire (14Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Google Scholar). This suggests that Mcm10 plays a unique role in DNA replication. Budding yeast Mcm10 has also been found to physically interact with the components of Orc and Mcm2-7 complexes (14Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Google Scholar). Moreover, it genetically interacts with Cdc45 and DNA polymerases δ and ϵ, which are necessary for the elongation steps of DNA replication (15Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926Google Scholar, 16Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Google Scholar). These results suggest that budding yeast Mcm10 is involved in both the activation of the pre-RC and the elongation steps of DNA replication. Mcm10 homologs have been identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Xenopus (17Aves S.J. Tongue N. Foster A.J. Hart E.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 164-171Google Scholar, 18Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Google Scholar, 19Christensen T.W. Tye B.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2206-2215Google Scholar). Recently we identified human Mcm10 and found that human Mcm10 interacts with the mammalian Orc2 protein and the Mcm2-7 complex (20Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.-Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Google Scholar), similar to the budding yeast Mcm10. However, the budding yeast and vertebrate Mcm10 proteins seem to have different functions. In S. cerevisiae, removing Mcm10 from the chromatin in G1 phase releases Mcm2 from chromatin, which suggests that Mcm10 is required for pre-RC formation (15Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926Google Scholar). In contrast, the human and Xenopus Mcm10 proteins bind chromatin after pre-RC formation (18Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Google Scholar, 21Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Google Scholar). In addition, the functions of Mcm10 seem to be controlled by different mechanisms between species. Human Mcm10 protein levels fluctuate during the cell cycle and decrease from anaphase to G1 phase (21Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Google Scholar). Human Mcm10 also specifically binds chromatin in S phase and dissociates from chromatin in G2/M phase, which is accompanied by protein phosphorylation (21Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Google Scholar). In contrast, in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, Mcm10 remains bound to chromatin throughout the entire cell cycle and displays constant expression levels (15Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926Google Scholar, 16Kawasaki Y. Hiraga S. Sugino A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 975-989Google Scholar, 22Gregan J. Lindner K. Brimage L. Franklin R. Namdar M. Hart E.A. Aves S.J. Kearsey S.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3876-3887Google Scholar). Our previous studies suggest that human Mcm10 is involved in S phase progression, although the precise role played by human Mcm10 still remains unknown. To clarify the function of Mcm10 in mammalian cells, we established HeLa cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Mcm10 and studied the dynamics of Mcm10 localization during the cell cycle. The subcellular localization of human Mcm10 changed during S phase progression, and it appeared to be recruited to the replication sites prior to DNA synthesis. These results indicate that human Mcm10 may participate in the activation of pre-RC. The implication of these results and the role Mcm10 may play in DNA replication are discussed. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA for human Mcm10 was first subcloned into ptetGFP (23Izumi M. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 76: 280-289Google Scholar) or ptetHA11, which contains the GFP tag or HA epitope tag upstream of the multicloning sites, respectively. To construct ptetHA11, two oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-CCGGT CGCCA CCATG GCTAG CTACC CATAC GACGT CCCAG ACTAC GCTAG CTTGA-3′ and 5′-GATCT CAAGC TAGCG TAGTC TGGGA CGTCG TATGG GTAGC TAGCC ATGGT GGCGA-3′ were annealed and cloned into the AgeI-BglII sites of ptetGFP. Human Mcm10 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-ATTAG TCGAC GATGA GGAGG AAGAC AATCT GTC-3′ and 5′-ATTAC CGCGG TTTTA AGGCT GTTCA GAAAT TTAGC ATG-3′, digested with SacII and SalI, and subcloned into the compatible sites of ptetGFP or ptetHA11 to construct ptetGFP-Mcm10 or ptetHA11-Mcm10, respectively. Sequence analysis confirmed that no mutations had been introduced into the amplified sequence during PCR. To construct pIREShyg/GFP-Mcm10 or pIREShyg/HA-Mcm10, ptetGFP-Mcm10 or ptetHA11-Mcm10 was digested with AgeI and DraI, filled with T4 DNA polymerase, and the resulting fragment containing the entire coding region for GFP-tagged Mcm10 or HA-tagged Mcm10 was cloned into the BamHI site of pIREShyg (Clontech). Cell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For synchronization at the mitotic phase, exponentially growing cells were treated with 50 ng/ml nocodazole (Aldrich) for 4 h and collected by mitotic shake-off. For synchronization in the G1 phase, the mitotic cells were collected as described above, washed twice with nocodazole-free medium, and cultured with fresh medium for 1.5 h. For synchronization at the G1/S boundary, the mitotic cells were collected as described above and replated in the presence of 15 μm aphidicolin (Sigma) for 12–14 h. The cells were released in aphidicolin-free medium and harvested at the indicated time points. Fractionation of cellular proteins and immunoblotting were performed as described (21Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Google Scholar). Transfection—The expression vector pIREShyg/GFP-Mcm10 or pIREShyg/HA-Mcm10 was linearized with SspI and transfected into HeLa cells by using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Izumi M. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 76: 280-289Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Individual colonies were isolated and screened for the expression of GFP-Mcm10 or HA-Mcm10 by immunoblotting. Stable transformant cell lines were maintained in the presence of hygromycin B. Flow Cytometry—To prepare cells for analysis by flow cytometry, mitotic cells were collected by mitotic shake-off and released into normal medium. The cells were harvested at the various time points and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were treated with RNaseA (0.25 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and then stained with propidium iodide (40 μg/ml). The DNA content of cells was analyzed with a FACSort (Becton Dickinson). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, fixed with ice-cold 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS at 4 °C for 5 min. In experiments where cells were first extracted, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated in cytoskeleton buffer (CSK buffer: 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, I mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2× Complete™ (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 4 °C before fixation. The coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (24Izumi M. Vaughan O.A. Hutchison C.J. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4323-4337Google Scholar). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (sc-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and nucleolin (sc-8031; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies and a Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). In double-staining experiments where proteins were colocalized with sites of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-substituted DNA, the cells were labeled with 30 μg/ml BrdU for 10 min and fixed in ethanol:acetic acid (19:1) at –20 °C for 10 min. The cells were first stained for the HA tag using a rabbit anti-HA tag antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) and an Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) or stained for PCNA using a mouse monoclonal antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After the primary and secondary antibodies were fixed in ethanol:acetic acid (19:1) at –20 °C for 10 min, DNA was depurinated with 2 n HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 30 min. BrdU was detected by using a rat anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (Harlan Sera-Lab Ltd.) and a Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-Rat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The cells were visualized using an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope equipped with the 100 × 1.35NA UplanApo oil-immersion objective. The images were taken by a CCD camera and assembled using IP Lab software. In Vivo Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—To label proteins with [35S]methionine, 1.5 × 106 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10-fold less methionine and 3% dialyzed calf serum for 1 h and then in the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. For the pulse-chase experiment, the cells were chased with aphidicolin-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with normal 10% calf serum and 150 μg/ml methionine. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, and 2× Complete (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifuged to obtain the lysates. The lysates were incubated with 1 μl of anti-Mcm10 rabbit antiserum at 4 °C for 1 h, after which 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated for an additional 1 h. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and the precipitates were dissolved in 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Expression of His6-tagged Mcm10 Protein in Escherichia coli—His6-tagged Mcm10 was constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified human Mcm10 into the SalI-NotI sites of pET24a (Novagen). Expression of His6-tagged Mcm10 was induced in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were suspended in 1/20 culture volume of lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and lysed on ice by mild sonication. The insoluble material containing His6-tagged Mcm10 was collected by centrifugation and solubilized in 8 m urea buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 8 m urea). His6-tagged Mcm10 was purified over a TALON column (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Establishment of HeLa Cell Lines Expressing GFP-tagged Mcm10 —To better understand the dynamics of human Mcm10 localization during the cell cycle, we first tried to detect endogenous Mcm10 protein by indirect immunofluorescence. This was unsuccessful because of the poor reactivity of the anti-Mcm10 antibody in immunohistochemistry. Therefore, we established stable HeLa cell lines that express a GFP-tagged Mcm10 protein. The expression of GFP-Mcm10 was maintained by the bicistronic message encoding the hygromycin B-resistant gene (hyg) because the expression of transfected genes in mammalian cells is usually repressed by epigenetic mechanisms. Forty individual clonal cell lines were expanded in the presence of hygromycin B and screened for GFP-Mcm10 expression by immunoblotting. Fig. 1a shows the immunoblot of the whole cell extracts made from 11 cell lines that were probed with the anti-Mcm10 antibody, which recognizes both the endogenous Mcm10 protein that migrates at 100 kDa and the GFP-tagged Mcm10 protein that migrates at 130 kDa. Each of these cell lines expressed GFP-Mcm10 at different levels relative to endogenous Mcm10 expression. G10-24 and G10-30 cells were initially considered to be the most desirable of the cell lines for further studies because they expressed the exogenous GFP-Mcm10 protein at significantly lower levels compared with endogenous Mcm10 expression, which minimizes the possibility of artifacts caused by overexpression. However, GFP-Mcm10 fluorescence in these cell lines was below the level of detection by fluorescence microscopy. Therefore, for further experiments, we used G10-1 cells, which express GFP-Mcm10 at twice the level of the endogenous Mcm10 protein. In nearly all of the cells in the G10-1 population, GFP-Mcm10 was detectable and expressed at relatively homogenous levels. We also found that the exogenous GFP-Mcm10 in the G10-1 cells did not interfere with normal cell cycle progression (Fig. 1b). GFP-Mcm10 Is Functionally Equivalent to the Endogenous Mcm10 Protein—We first examined whether GFP-Mcm10 showed the same affinity for chromatin as endogenous Mcm10. Thus, G10-1 cells were lysed in a Triton X-100-containing CSK buffer with 0.1 m NaCl or 0.3 m NaCl, and soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by low speed centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting. The GFP-Mcm10 protein as well as the endogenous Mcm10 remained in the insoluble chromatin fraction at 0.1 m NaCl but increasing the salt concentration to 0.3 m removed both proteins from the chromatin (Fig. 1c). We have previously reported that human Mcm10 is regulated by proteolysis and phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner (21Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Google Scholar). To verify that GFP-Mcm10 is regulated in the same manner as endogenous Mcm10, the cells were synchronized in metaphase with nocodazole followed by mitotic shake-off. The cells were either collected as metaphase populations or released into the cell cycle and collected 1.5 h after release (G1 phase), or accumulated at the G1/S boundary with aphidicolin. The cells were then fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, and the subcellular localization of GFP-Mcm10 was investigated by immunoblotting (Fig. 1d). In cells that had been synchronized to be in the G1 phase or at the G1/S boundary, most of the GFP-Mcm10 proteins were mainly found in the insoluble fraction. GFP-Mcm10 appeared to be more soluble at the G1/S boundary, which may be due to the effect of GFP-tag. At metaphase, however, the GFP-Mcm10 protein dissociated from the chromatin and was found in the soluble fraction. This pattern reflects that of endogenous Mcm10. Moreover, the expression of GFP-Mcm10 decreased in the early G1 phase, as did the expression of endogenous Mcm10. The down-regulation of GFP-Mcm10 could be explained by its proteasome-mediated proteolysis because the presence of proteasome inhibitors stabilized GFP-Mcm10 levels (data not shown). In addition, like endogenous Mcm10, GFP-Mcm10 in metaphase showed slower electrophoretic mobility, which could be due to its phosphorylation (21Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Google Scholar). Thus, the GFP-tagged protein appears to be regulated in the same fashion as its endogenous counterpart throughout the cell cycle. This suggests that GFP-Mcm10 is functional and equivalent to endogenous Mcm10 in living cells and that GFP-Mcm10 does not impair the function of endogenous Mcm10 as a dominant negative mutant. The Intracellular Distribution of GFP-Mcm10 Changes throughout the Cell Cycle—We next examined the localization of GFP-Mcm10 in G10-1 cells. In an asynchronous population of G10-1 cells, GFP-Mcm10 was found to be concentrated in the nucleus, but weak fluorescence was also detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2a, left panels). The distribution of GFP-Mcm10 in the nucleus was relatively homogeneous (Fig. 2a, right panels). However, a different distribution of GFP-Mcm10 was observed when the cells were subjected to Triton X-100 extraction to remove soluble proteins (data not shown). In these cells, GFP-Mcm10 was observed as discrete foci in the nucleus. This distribution has also been observed for many DNA replication proteins, including PCNA (25Leonhardt H. Rahn H.-P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-279Google Scholar), and replication foci (26O'Keefe R.T. Henderson S.C. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1095-1110Google Scholar). The fluorescence of GFP-Mcm10 in the cytoplasm disappeared after extraction. The distribution, number, and size of the GFP-Mcm10 foci in the individual cells varied. This is probably due to the fact that the cell population was asynchronous. Thus, to determine more precisely how the various staining patterns correlated with particular cell cycle phases, the cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary by aphidicolin treatment following mitotic shake-off and then released in aphidicolin-free medium. Three kinds of localization patterns were observed, each of which was observed at specific time points during the S phase (Fig. 2, b and c). The first pattern (type I) appeared in the first 3 h from the G1/S boundary. This pattern was characterized by hundreds of small foci distributed throughout the nuclei with the exception of the nucleoli. The second pattern (type II) appeared 3 h after the release into S phase. This pattern was characterized by foci concentrated around the nucleoli and in the nuclear periphery. At 3 h after release, weak fluorescence was still detected in the nucleoplasm. This disappeared 4.5 h after release. At 6 h after release, the number of foci decreased. The third pattern (type III) was observed toward the end of the S phase (6–7.5 h after release). This pattern was characterized by the appearance of GFP-Mcm10 in nucleoli. That GFP-Mcm10 was localized in the nucleoli during this phase was confirmed by the colocalization of nucleolin and GFP-Mcm10 (Fig. 2d). The physiological function of Mcm10 in nucleoli in late S phase is unknown. It may be that localization in the nucleoli serves to sequestrate Mcm10, thereby preventing it from reaching its target, which may help to ensure that a replicated chromosome does not reinitiate replication.Fig. 2Subcellular localization of GFP-Mcm10 during the cell cycle.a, asynchronous populations of G10-1 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. DNA was stained with DAPI, and the cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy. b, G10-1 cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary and released into the S phase. To monitor DNA synthesis after release from the G1/S boundary, cells at each time point were pulse-labeled with BrdU, and the percentage of BrdU-positive cells was scored. c, at various intervals from the G1/S boundary, the cells were extracted with CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice prior to fixation and then observed by fluorescence microscopy. d, cells were extracted with CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and fixed at 4.5 or 7.5 h from the G1/S boundary. Nucleolin was detected by indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-nucleolin antibody and a Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. e, whole cell extracts (wce) and Triton X-100-soluble fractions (sup) and insoluble fractions (ppt) were prepared at each time point after release from the G1/S boundary and subjected to immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 1b. f, cells undergoing mitosis were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. DNA was stained with DAPI, and the cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is known that some fixation protocols alter the localization of proteins. To test the veracity of our confocal studies, we fixed cells with either 3.7% formaldehyde or ethanol:acetic acid (19: 1). The same results were obtained. We also found that the same patterns were obtained when a different cell line was tested (data not shown), which indicates that these patterns are also not specific to one cell clone. Moreover, we examined the subcellular localization of GFP-Mcm10 and endogenous Mcm10 during S phase progression by immunoblotting after fractionating the cells into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble samples. Both GFP-Mcm10 and endogenous Mcm10 bound chromatin during the S phase and dissociated from chromatin in the G2 phase (Fig. 2e). This is consistent with our earlier observations (Fig. 1c). Also consistent with this is our observation that during mitosis, GFP-Mcm10 was absent from condensed chromosomes and had diffused into the cytoplasm (Fig. 2f). GFP-Mcm10 Is Recruited to Replication Sites before They Replicate—We next investigated the spatial relationship between the GFP-Mcm10 foci and PCNA foci. The nuclear foci of PCNA have been well characterized and are known to colocalize with sites of newly synthesized DNA (24Izumi M. Vaughan O.A. Hutchison C.J. Gilbert D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4323-4337Google Scholar). Thus, synchronized cells were extracted prior to fixation, and PCNA was detected by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 3a). The cells arrested at the G1/S boundary by aphidicolin did not display any PCNA fluorescent labeling, whereas GFP-Mcm10 bound chromatin and appeared to be distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. Between 10 min and 1.5 h after release from the G1/S boundary, both the GFP-Mcm10 foci and the PCNA foci showed the type I pattern. However, the GFP-Mcm10 foci and the PCNA foci did not colocalize in most cases. At 3 h after release, the GFP-Mcm10 foci started to accumulate around the nucleoli and the nuclear periphery, whereas the PCNA foci were still distributed throughout the nuclei. Between 4.5 and 6 h, both the GFP-Mcm10 foci and the PCNA foci were concentrated around the nucleoli and in the nuclear periphery. At 7.5 h, GFP-Mcm10 was mainly concentrated in the nucleoli, whereas PCNA formed a few discrete foci around the nucleoli and in the nuclear periphery. Each of the patterns were enriched at specific time points, and the transition in the GFP-Mcm10 distributions preceded that of the PCNA distributions by 30–60 min (Fig. 3b). To confirm the above results, we examined the correlation of the appearance of Mcm10 foci with that of the DNA replication foci. The DNA replication foci were detected by pulse labeling with the nucleotide analog BrdU and staining with an antibody against BrdU. Because the acid treatment denatures GFP and results in the loss of fluoresce"
https://openalex.org/W1998029527,"The herpes simplex virus, type I origin-binding protein, OBP, is a superfamily II DNA helicase encoded by the UL9 gene. OBP binds in a sequence-specific and cooperative way to the viral origin of replication oriS. OBP may unwind partially and introduce a hairpin into the double-stranded origin of replication. The formation of the novel conformation referred to as oriS* also requires the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ICP8, and ATP hydrolysis. OBP forms a stable complex with oriS*. The hairpin in oriS* provides a site for sequence-specific attachment, and a single-stranded region triggers ATP hydrolysis. Here we use Escherichia coli exonuclease I to map the binding of the C-terminal domain of OBP to the hairpin and the helicase domains to the single-stranded tail. The helicase domains cover a stretch of 23 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA. Using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, we show that OBP may bind two copies of double-stranded DNA (one biotin-labeled and the other one radioactively labeled) but only one copy of oriS*. It is the length of the single-stranded tail that determines the stoichiometry of OBP·DNA complexes. OBP interacts with the bases of the single-stranded tail, and ATP hydrolysis is triggered by position-specific interactions between OBP and bases in the single-stranded tail of oriS*. The herpes simplex virus, type I origin-binding protein, OBP, is a superfamily II DNA helicase encoded by the UL9 gene. OBP binds in a sequence-specific and cooperative way to the viral origin of replication oriS. OBP may unwind partially and introduce a hairpin into the double-stranded origin of replication. The formation of the novel conformation referred to as oriS* also requires the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ICP8, and ATP hydrolysis. OBP forms a stable complex with oriS*. The hairpin in oriS* provides a site for sequence-specific attachment, and a single-stranded region triggers ATP hydrolysis. Here we use Escherichia coli exonuclease I to map the binding of the C-terminal domain of OBP to the hairpin and the helicase domains to the single-stranded tail.

OBP interacts with the bases of the single-stranded tail, and ATP hydrolysis is triggered by position-specific interactions between OBP and bases in the single-stranded tail of oriS*. Replication of Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) relies on the activation of the viral origins of replication oriS and oriL by the origin-binding protein (OBP) 1The abbreviations used are: OBP, origin-binding protein; HSV-1, Herpes simplex virus type I; ICP8, infected cell protein 8; ΔOBP, C-terminal DNA binding domain of OBP; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). encoded by the UL9 gene (1Lehman I.R.

IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Events catalyzed by OBP assisted by the single-stranded binding protein, ICP8, lead to the assembly of the prototypical herpes virus replisome consisting of the heterodimeric UL30/42 DNA polymerase, the trimeric UL5/8/52 helicase primase complex, and ICP8. The herpes virus replisome is capable of coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strand products (3Falkenberg M. Lehman I.R. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3896-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The bulk of replicated DNA appears to be produced by a rolling circle mode of replication forming extensive stretches of genome concatemers (4Jacob R.J. Morse L.S. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 448-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the failure to demonstrate circular genomes in cells infected with wild type HSV-1 before the onset of DNA synthesis indicates that circular genomes may not be the initial replication template (5Jackson S.A. DeLuca N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7831-7876Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination occurs frequently during virus replication. Events such as genome isomerization, replication of genomic termini, and repair of double-stranded breaks may all involve homologous recombination. Several plausible mechanisms for the recombination events have been suggested and received experimental support (6Wilkinson D.E. Weller S.K. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Reuven N.B. Staire A.E. Myers R.S. Weller S.K. J.

Nevertheless, the enzymes responsible for recombination remain poorly characterized. Initiation of HSV-1 DNA replication is probably a rate-limiting step in the production of virus progeny, because DNA synthesis on a linear substrate is much less efficient than it is on a circular template (10Yao X.-D. Matecic M. Elias P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6842-6849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter case, one initiation event will lead to extensive synthesis of daughter molecules. Therefore, it is probable that the initiator protein and the replicator sequence co-evolve to ascertain the necessary specificity and efficiency needed for species-specific amplification of viral genomes. To understand in biochemical terms how this is achieved, we have studied the interaction of HSV-1 OBP and the viral origin of replication oriS as well as the interaction of OBP with a probable intermediate in the activation process referred to as oriS* (11Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

OriS* is an unwound form of double-stranded oriS in which a stable hairpin with a 3′-single-stranded region is formed (Fig. 1, A and B). A role for oriS* during DNA replication in vivo is based on the observations that the sequence arrangement is conserved evolutionarily, and mutations that disrupt the structure of oriS* reduce DNA replication. Second site mutations that restore the ability to form oriS* enhance DNA replication (12Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). OBP binds tightly and specifically to oriS*; therefore, it is possible to study in detail the positioning of OBP on the DNA molecule and the functional consequences of the protein-DNA interactions. OriS contains three binding sites for OBP arranged in an evolutionarily conserved manner (12Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Boxes I and II are strong binding sites positioned as inverted repeats separated by an AT-rich spacer sequence. Box III is a low affinity site existing as an inverted repeat with box I. Boxes I and III may base pair with each other and form the stable hairpin characteristic of oriS* (Fig. 1, A and B). OBP is a superfamily II DNA helicase (14Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 15Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R.

It is a stable dimer that binds specifically and cooperatively to oriS (17Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of OBP binds as a monomer to the recognition sequence GTTCGCAC referred to above as box I (18Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18613-18617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cooperative binding to boxes I and II is dependent on the N-terminal helicase domains of the protein (20Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17242-17429Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). An extensive series of mutations have been made in the so-called helicase motifs of OBP (21Marintcheva B. Weller S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6605-6615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Marintcheva B. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These studies implicate motif Ia in the recognition of single-stranded DNA and by inference to the activation of ATP hydrolysis (22Marintcheva B. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The functional role of OBP in herpes simplex virus, type I DNA replication is to catalyze the unwinding of oriS and possibly also a more extensive stretch of DNA. The unwinding appears to proceed in at least two steps. Initially, cooperative binding of OBP to oriS leads to the destabilization of the AT-rich spacer sequence as shown by a hyperchromic effect and an increased sensitivity to nuclease P1 (23He X. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the second step, OBP assisted by ICP8 and at the expense of ATP hydrolysis is able to separate the two strands completely and produce an OBP·oriS* complex (13Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 43: 41204-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On supercoiled DNA, OBP together with ICP8 catalyzes additional unwinding as seen in experiments using electron microscopy (24Makhov A.M. Lee S.S.-K. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Extensive unwinding of an oriS-containing plasmid also can be carried out by OBP alone but at a much lower efficiency (25Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we present results describing the positioning of OBP on oriS*, the stoichiometry of OBP·DNA complexes, and the identification of position-specific base contacts with single-stranded DNA that lead to the activation of ATP hydrolysis. These observations can now be integrated into the model for initiation of Herpes simplex virus, type I DNA replication alluded to above. Proteins and Nucleic Acids—The UL9 protein, ΔOBP, and ICP8 were purified as described previously (13Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol.

Ten units of E. coli exonuclease I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were extracted by phenol and chloroform. The aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol according to standard procedure. The samples were analyzed finally on an 8% urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel. OriS80 was cleaved at the G and A nucleotides and used as a marker as described previously (18Simonsson S. Samuelsson T. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24633-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ATPase Assays—ATPase assays were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 17.4% glycerol, 8% Me2SO, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm Mg2+-ATP, 250–300 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) with 0.2 pmol of UL9 protein, and 0.25 pmol of oligonucleotide in a final volume of 10 μl unless otherwise indicated. Incubation was for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of a suspension of 12% w/v Norit A in 0.1 m HCl and 10 mm KH2PO4. The mixture was vortexed briefly and then centrifuged for 3 min at 7000 × g. 200 μl of the supernatant was added to 3 ml of scintillation mixture (Ready Safe, Beckman), and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation system (LS 6000TA, Beckman). The enzyme-dependent release of phosphate was calculated by subtracting the release of phosphate in samples without enzyme. The assays were performed in duplicates or triplicates and repeated at least twice. OBP·DNA binding Assays—The formation of complexes between OBP and the DNA ligands was examined either in gel-retardation experiments using agarose gels or in co-precipitation experiments using biotin-labeled oligonucleotides and streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. For the gel-retardation experiments, the reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 0.2 nm of radiolabeled oligonucleotide and 20 nm of the UL9 protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATPγS, 25 mm KCl, and 0.4 μg of bovine serum albumin. The samples were mixed on ice and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. They were centrifuged briefly and transferred to ice before loading onto the agarose gels. The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on 0.9% agarose gels in standard 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were run at 7 V/cm for 90 min at ambient temperature. The gels were dried onto DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman) and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. The co-precipitation experiments were performed in a 10-μl standard reaction mixture containing 50 nm OBP, 10 nm32P-labeled PE17/18, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 75 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, 50 μm ATPγS, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The biotinylated oligonucleotide was added as indicated. The mixture was mixed on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. A 5-μl suspension of 20 μg/μl Dynabeads® M-280 streptavidin (Dynal Biotech ASA) was added, and the mixture was shaken for 10 min at ambient temperature. The beads were set to separate on a magnetic particle concentrator (MPC-S, Dynal Biotech ASA). After the removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. The concentrated beads were re-suspended in 20 μl of the same buffer, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting as described above. Positioning OBP on oriS*—As a starting point for these investigations, we decided to map the interaction between OBP and oriS* using an exonuclease I digestion assay (Fig. 1C). We used a single-stranded oligonucleotide, oriS80, that corresponds to the upper strand of oriS (Fig. 1B and Ref. 13Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 43: 41204-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This oligonucleotide spontaneously adopts the oriS* conformation. We noted that exonuclease I readily digested the 3′-tail of oriS80. Strong pause sites for exonuclease I were seen at positions 34–36 located on the right at the 3′-end of the box III-box I hairpin. In the presence of the monomeric C-terminal domain of OBP (ΔOBP), the protected region was extended to position 41 corresponding to eight nucleotides of the single-stranded tail. ΔOBP may bind directly to the single-stranded tail, because it has a capacity to bind single-stranded DNA (27Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, it may also merely shield a part of the single-stranded tail from nuclease digestion. Intact OBP caused a prominent shift of the pause sites to nucleotides 51–53 in the single-stranded tail. Thus, altogether 23 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA are covered by OBP and, as discussed below, directly bind to the helicase domains and trigger ATP hydrolysis. The single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ICP8, is needed to convert an 80-bp double-stranded minimal oriS fragment to oriS*, and it remains bound to the OBP·oriS* complex (13Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 43: 41204-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have examined its effect on the OBP-oriS* interaction using the exonuclease I digestion assay. We could not detect the protection of the single-stranded tail from nuclease digestion by ICP8 alone. However, we noted that there was less full-length material remaining after the incubation period, suggesting that ICP8 melts out the residual secondary structure and facilitates nuclease digestion. ICP8 did not extend the protection of the single-stranded tail caused by ΔOBP. As noted before, an interaction between ICP8 and the single-stranded DNA will lead to a disruption of the ICP8·ΔOBP complex (27Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It appears that, under the conditions used in the exonuclease I digestion experiment, the ICP8-DNA interaction is not stable enough to result in protection from enzymatic degradation. Interestingly, ICP8 caused extended protection from nuclease digestion to position 58 in the presence of full-length OBP. In this instance, ICP8 and the helicase domains of OBP will compete for the same stretch of single-stranded DNA and, as a consequence, the ICP8·OBP complex remains stable. Stoichiometry of the OBP·oriS* Complex—OriS* is an efficient activator of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by OBP (12Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A box III-box I hairpin with a single-stranded tail consisting of only 10 nucleotides is enough to cause almost maximal stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. What then is the effect of the additional nucleotides of the single-stranded tail that are protected by OBP from exonuclease I digestion? We first examined the ability of OBP to form complexes with a diverse set of DNA ligands (Fig. 2). In agreement with results published previously (12Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we saw that OBP formed one unique complex with wild type oriS* as represented by the oligonucleotide Awt-Bwt (Table I). A DNA ligand consisting of a box III-box I hairpin with a 10-nucleotide single-stranded tail, HP-dT10, gave rise to two complexes. We then replaced the single-stranded oligonucleotide tail of HP-dT10 with an abasic spacer of 10 deoxyribose phosphates terminated by a thymidylate residue (HP-dS10) and found that only a small amount of a single complex was formed. The same result was obtained using only the hairpin as the DNA ligand. Finally, a single-stranded oligonucleotide, T65, did not generate stable complexes with well defined electrophoretic mobilities. These observations are summarized as follows. First, the presence of multiple complexes using HP-dT10 suggests that the stoichiometry of the complexes differs. Second, because the electrophoretic mobilities of the OBP·Awt-Bwt complex and OBP·HP-dT10 differ, it is probable that the charge of the complex determines the electrophoretic mobility. Third, interactions between the helicase domain and the bases of the single-stranded tail strongly affect complex formation as indicated by the small amount of complex formed between OBP and HP-dS10. Fourth, single-stranded DNA alone cannot support complex formation. A working hypothesis was formed on the basis of these observations. We suggest that dimeric OBP allows simultaneous and possibly cooperative binding of two double-stranded DNA ligands but only permits the binding of one oriS* ligand with a single-stranded tail exceeding 10 nucleotides. To further examine this idea, we made oligonucleotides containing a hairpin sequence with single-stranded tails of increasing length (Fig. 3). In gel-retardation experiments, we noted that oligonucleotides with tail lengths shorter than 10 nucleotides gave rise to moderate quantities of a complex referred to as complex A (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). Oligonucleotides with single-stranded tails longer than 10 nucleotides gave rise to a larger amount of a complex with a slower electrophoretic mobility referred to as complex B (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–7). The transition from complex A to complex B occurred abruptly when the tail length increased from 8 to 10 nucleotides. As the tail length increased further, so did the electrophoretic mobility of complex B. To see whether complex B contained one or two ligands, a mixing experiment was performed (Fig. 3B). Two oligonucleotides, HP-dT15 and HP-dT29, were mixed and incubated with OBP. We found that only two complexes were formed. The electrophoretic mobilities of these complexes were identical with the electrophoretic mobilities of complexes obtained with a single DNA ligand, and we found no evidence for a complex with intermediate mobility. We conclude that complex B consists of an OBP dimer with a single oriS* ligand bound. By inference, we suggest that complex A corresponds to a complex between an OBP dimer and two DNA ligands. These DNA ligands most probably occupy the binding sites on the C-terminal domains of the OBP dimer. An alternative way of examining the DNA binding properties of OBP is to look for simultaneous binding of two differently labeled DNA molecules to the same protein molecule. Therefore, we made use of a biotin-labeled duplex oligonucleotide containing the BoxI recognition sequence for OBP, biotin-17/18, 32P-labeled BoxI duplex oligonucleotide, [32P]17/18, and a biotin-labeled version of oriS*, biotin-HP-dT29. OBP and its C-terminal domain, ΔOBP, were incubated with the various DNA ligands. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads then were added to immobilize the biotin-labeled oligonucleotides and their interaction partners. The experiments were made by adding increasing amounts of the biotin-labeled oligonucleotide and keeping the concentration of the radioactively labeled oligonucleotide constant. If complexes containing both biotin-labeled oligonucleotide and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide are formed, we expect to see an initial increase in the amount of radioactive oligonucleotide bound to the magnetic beads. A maximum will be observed at approximately equimolar concentrations of the oligonucleotides. The amount of radioactive oligonucleotide bound to the magnetic beads will decrease at high concentrations of the biotin-labeled oligonucleotide because of competition between the oligonucleotides for binding to OBP. The ligand binding properties of OBP and ΔOBP were examined in this way (Fig. 4). We found that, in the presence of dimeric OBP, simultaneous binding of biotin-17/18 and [32P]17/18 to the beads was observed (Fig. 4A). Maximum binding was seen using ∼30 nm of a biotin-labeled oligonucleotide. In contrast, monomeric ΔOBP failed to promote the binding of [32P]17/18 to the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. In a separate experiment, the effect of protein concentrations was examined. Increasing OBP concentrations resulted in the increased binding of [32P]17/18 until saturation was achieved. In contrast, increasing concentrations of ΔOBP did not result in an increased binding of [32P]17/18 to the magnetic beads. Finally, to examine the OBP-oriS* interaction biotin-HP-dT29 was used together with [32P]17/18 (Fig. 4C). The binding of [32P]17/18 to the beads now was reduced significantly. This observation suggests that, if one copy of the biotin-HP-dT29 is bound to one OBP dimer, the binding of additional DNA ligands to the dimer is precluded. When the experiment was performed in the presence of ICP8, a further reduction in the amount of [32P]17/18 bound to the beads was noted (results not shown). The results obtained using the co-precipitation assay agree with the results obtained from the gel electrophoresis experiments. In summary, one OBP dimer can bind two molecules of a double-stranded DNA ligand simultaneously but only one molecule of oriS*. Importantly, the length of the single-stranded tail determines the stoichiometry of the OBP·DNA complex. We also see that contacts between OBP and bases of the single-stranded DNA promote the formation of complexes. It is tempting to speculate that single-stranded DNA may serve as an allosteric effector, although one cannot exclude that competition for the same binding site occurs once the tail length exceeds ten nucleotides. Position-specific Base Contacts Trigger ATP Hydrolysis— Here, we try to identify the contacts between OBP and single-stranded DNA that trigger ATP hydrolysis. To sort out whether interactions between OBP and the DNA backbone or interactions between OBP and the bases of the single-stranded tail are involved in stimulating ATP hydrolysis, we first replaced the oligodeoxythymidylate tail with a stretch of ten abasic deoxyribose phosphates terminated by a 3′-terminal thymidine residue. This cofactor, HP-dS10, was a poor activator of ATP hydrolysis, indicating that contacts between the bases of the tail and OBP are essential for triggering ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5A). The oligonucleotide HP-dS5dT6, in which five abasic residues preceeded six thymidines, behaved as a superactivator of ATP hydrolysis. An oligonucleotide, HP-dT5dS5, with a reverse order in the tail behaved as HP-dS10 (Fig. 5A). To further localize the residues responsible for activating ATP hydrolysis, a series of oligonucleotides were made in which specific thymidines were replaced by abasic spacer residues (Fig. 5B). Again HP-dS5dT6 was a superactivator. The thymidines of HP-dS5-dT6 were then replaced one by one by abasic residues in HP-dS6-dT5 and HPdS7-dT4. The effects on ATP hydrolysis were prominent. By replacing thymidines at positions 6 and 7 with abasic spacer residues, ATP hydrolysis returned to a level seen with HP-dS10 (Fig. 5B). The rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined from the graphs in Fig. 5B and presented in Table II. We can rationalize these observations by assuming that position-specific base contacts, e.g. positions six and seven in the single-stranded tail, are needed to stimulate ATP hydrolysis. Additional base contacts may stabilize the binding of the DNA activator to OBP, and the absence of these base contacts may facilitate dissociation from and rebinding to single-stranded DNA. In the presence of HPdS5dT6, successive rounds of ATP hydrolysis, therefore, may be facilitated despite the fact that OBP cannot move along the DNA substrate.Table IIThe values were calculated from the experiment presented in Fig. 5BOligonucleotide co-factorATP hydrolysispmol/minNo DNA3.4T658.5HP-dT1016.7HP-dS5dT626.8HP-dS6dT515.6HP-dS7dT411.5HP-dS108.2 Open table in a new tab We have also performed a competition experiment using HP-dT10 and HP-dS10 as activators of ATP hydrolysis. The result indicates that HP-dS10 and HP-dT10 competes for the same site on OBP, and that the affinity of OBP for the cofactors is very similar (Fig. 5C). Helicases have important and diverse roles in DNA and RNA metabolism (28van Brabant A.J. Stan R. Ellis N.A. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 409-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Silverman E. Edwalds-Gilbert G. Lin R.J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 312: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Here, we focus our attention on the HSV-1 origin-binding protein, also referred to as the UL9 protein. It is a DNA helicase belonging to superfamily II (14Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Enzymes of superfamily I and II share certain structural features. They have two copies of a RecA-like domain, which together form a site for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (30Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 31Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In many instances, the interaction with single-stranded DNA stimulates ATP hydrolysis and subsequent steps lead to conformational changes that allow movement of the protein along the DNA polymer. Crystal structures of Rep, PcrA, and NS3 helicases reveal that single-stranded DNA or RNA rides on top of the helicase domains across the cleft between the RecA-like domains (32Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 33Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.S.

Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In the case of Rep and PcrA, the superfamily I helicases, the bases in single-stranded DNA interact extensively with hydrophobic amino acids in the protein. These interactions appear to contribute to the movement of the helicase along DNA by an inchworm mechanism (35Dillingham M.S. Soultanas P. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8381-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In a crystal structure of Rep, a single 16-mer of oligodeoxythymidylate binds simultaneously to the two monomers of the asymmetric unit (32Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The two monomers exist in different conformations, the open and closed forms, yet they bind single-stranded DNA in the same way. The crystal structure of NS3 helicase, a superfamily II RNA helicase, shows that interactions between the protein and the backbone of RNA dominate. Additional domains may target a helicase to well defined DNA structures and/or proteins and make it an integrated partner in a molecular machine. For example, RecG appears to interact with the three arms of a replication fork (36McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 37Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the crystal structure indicates that the helicase domains in this instance might interact with duplex DNA (37Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this discussion, we examine how the structural and functional properties of the helicases described in the previous paragraph may relate to HSV-1 OBP and its ability to activate the viral origin of replication oriS. OBP binds in a cooperative and sequence-specific manner to the viral origin of replication oriS. Together with the single-strand DNA-binding protein ICP8, it converts double-stranded oriS to a novel conformation oriS* in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis (13Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 43: 41204-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The function of OBP is controlled by DNA structure. The distance between the binding sites must be appropriate to allow cooperative binding and initiation of DNA synthesis (38Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have suggested that the exposure of single-stranded DNA will cause a conformational change in ICP8 and release it from OBP (27Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unwound oriS must be able to adopt a novel conformation, oriS*, with stable hairpin structures presenting binding sites for OBP and a single-stranded tail interacting with the helicase domains of OBP to support DNA replication (11Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Aslani A. Olsson M. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 43: 41204-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have found that only a short piece, 10 nucleotides, of single-stranded DNA attached to a hairpin with a unique sequence, HP-dT10, is needed to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and that contacts not only with the DNA backbone but also with the bases of single-stranded DNA are needed for maximum binding to DNA as well as ATP hydrolysis. The bases at positions 6 and 7 of the tail appear to be especially important. A series of the mutations have been made in the helicase motifs of OBP, and it has been found that mutations in motif Ia result in proteins that no longer support replication of HSV-1 (22Marintcheva B. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In at least some cases, it appears that these residues directly contact single-stranded DNA as judged by comparison with Rep and NS3. Perhaps such studies could be extended to identify the amino acid residues in OBP, which contact the bases in single-stranded DNA and trigger ATP hydrolysis. The exonuclease I digestion experiments indicate that as much as 23 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA may be covered by the helicase domains of an OBP dimer. One then would want to speculate that approximately 8–10 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA interact with each of the two subunits of OBP, an observation that is in good agreement with the binding site of single-stranded DNA on Rep (32Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We have also found that an OBP dimer may bind two molecules of a double-stranded DNA ligand but only one molecule of oriS*. The ability of a dimer of OBP to the simultaneously bind two sites on double-stranded DNA may be essential for the correct cooperative positioning of OBP on oriS. OBP and oriS then must undergo mutual conformational changes, possibly in a concerted reaction, and establish novel interactions in the OBP·oriS* complex. A single-stranded region of defined length must be exposed at this stage to assist in the conversion of the 2:2 (OBP: ligand) complex to a 2:1 (OBP:ligand) complex. The structural studies and functional studies of E. coli Rep may help to understand this process. It has been shown, as mentioned above, that Rep in complex with single-stranded DNA may form an asymmetric dimer consisting of protomers in open and closed conformations (32Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Although the functional implications of the putative Rep dimer are poorly understood, there is accumulating evidence for dimers as active forms of the Rep and UvrD helicases (39Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Babcock H.P. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Chu S. Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 40Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 913-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the case of Rep, the two subunits bind to the same piece of single-stranded DNA. These observations lead us to suggest that OBP may be able to form either a dimer with the protomers in open/open conformation capable of binding two double-stranded DNA ligands or an asymmetric dimer with the protomers in open/closed conformation capable of binding only one molecule of oriS* (Fig. 6). These conformational changes may be facilitated by chaperones (41Tanguy Le Gac N. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5660-5666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We do not know with certainty the number of OBP molecules needed for the activation of HSV-1 oriS and oriL, but it is not an unlikely assumption that the two dimers may be required (25Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that the initial complex between OBP and oriS/oriL would be a symmetric arrangement of two dimers in the open/open conformation (Fig. 6). Upon exposure of single-stranded DNA accompanied by hydrolysis of ATP, the two dimers are converted to two dimers in the open/closed conformation positioned on opposite strands. The role of ICP8 is unclear. Perhaps its role is to facilitate strand separation and to prevent reannealing of the complementary strands in a reaction that is tightly coupled to the structural transitions of the OBP·oriS complex. A better understanding of the structure OBP and its interaction partners would be of great value to resolve these issues."

Here, we describe an erbstatin (Erb) analogue as a small molecule inhibitor of the N-type inactivation in channels of Kv1.4 and Kv1.1+Kvβ1. We show that this inhibition of inactivation (designated as “disinactivation”) is potent and selective for N-type inactivation in heterologous cells (Chinese hamster ovary and Xenopus oocytes) expressing these A-type channels. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, Erb increased the inactivation time constant of Kv1.4 from 86.5 ± 9.5 to 150 ± 10 ms (n = 6, p < 0.0 1). Similarly, Erb increased the inactivation time constant of Kv1.1+Kvβ1 from 10 ± 0.9 to 49.3 ± 7 ms (n = 7, p < 0.01). The EC50 for disinactivating Kv1.1+Kvβ1 was 10.4 ± 0.9 μm (n = 2–9). Erb had no effect upon another A-channel, Kv4.3, which does not utilize the ball-and-chain mechanism. The mechanism of Erb-induced disinactivation was also investigated. Neither cysteine oxidation nor tyrosine kinase inhibition was involved.

The amino-terminal domains of the Shaker, Kv1.4, and Kv3.4 Kv channel α-subunits, and the Kvβ1 β-subunit underlie rapid inactivation in certain Kv channels (so-called N-type inactivation; Refs. 1Heinemann S.

Because short synthetic peptides encoding these N-terminal amino acids can induce rapid inactivation when applied intracellularly to noninactivating Kv channels (3Murrell-Lagnado R. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 977-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 4Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the protein-protein interaction between these N-terminal inactivation domains and their putative receptor, the cytoplasmic S4-S5 loop of the channel α-subunit (2Isacoff E. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), could be used as targets for drug discovery. Moreover, we reasoned that small synthetic organic molecules that disrupt this protein-protein interaction might also eliminate N-type inactivation (a phenomenon we designated as “disinactivation”) when applied to mammalian cells expressing the corresponding full-length channel subunits, and would further suppress aberrant neuronal excitability by keeping rapidly inactivating Kv channels open longer. We focused on the human Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 α-subunits and the Kvβ1 β-subunit primarily because these three polypeptides coassociate and colocalize in hippocampal circuits (7Rhodes K.J. Strassle B.W. Monaghan M.M. Bekele-Arcuri Z. Matos M.F. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8246-8258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are frequently involved in seizure initiation and propagation in experimental animals and in humans. High-throughput screening strategies designed to search for small molecules that would achieve this kind of disinactivation have been presented previously (8Young K. Modi M. Mendoza G. Bowlby M. Childers W. Rhodes K.J. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; 25: 983Google Scholar). We have previously reported (9Zhang Z.-H. Wang Q. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that N-type inactivation can be modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. During our detailed studies, we have discovered rather unintentionally a novel effect of a compound known as erbstatin (Erb) 1The abbreviations used are: Erb, erbstatin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DTBNP, 2,2′-dithiobis-5-nitropyridine; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: Erb, erbstatin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DTBNP, 2,2′-dithiobis-5-nitropyridine; DTT, dithiothreitol. analogue, methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate (Fig. 1a; Refs. 10Umezawa H.

The results suggest that Erb may bind to the channel directly to affect the “ball-and-chain” mechanism and, thereby, the N-type inactivation. Because we used disinactivation (see above) to define the reduction or elimination of the N-type inactivation, agents like Erb are designated as “disinactivators.” The results in this report demonstrate that Erb or its analogues can be used as a base structure to identify potent, selective small molecule inhibitors of intracellular protein-protein interactions, and that these disinactivators may offer another therapeutic approach to the treatment of seizure disorders. Expression of Kv Channels in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells— Human Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 cDNAs were inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pWE1, to yield pWE1/Kvs. The constructs were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing (dideoxynucleotide chain termination method). CHOK1 cells were transfected with pWE1/Kvs using a non-liposomal formulation, FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells expressing Kv channels were detected by co-transfecting cells with a fluorescence marker, the green fluorescent protein-encoding plasmid. To produce Kv1.1/Kvβ1 channels, a stable CHO cell line expressing Kv1.1 was transiently transfected with Kvβ1 cDNAs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Expression of Kv Channels in Xenopus Oocytes—For cRNA synthesis, in vitro transcription was carried out using a T3 mMESSAGE kit (Ambion) after linearization of the construct with NotI. Xenopus oocytes (stages V-VI) were injected with 46 nl of aqueous solution containing less than 10 ng of cRNA using a Drummond Nanoject II auto-nanoliter injector (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA). At or after 48 h of RNA injection, oocytes were tested using a two-electrode voltage-clamp for channel expression. Electrophysiology—All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–23 °C) using the standard patch-clamp whole-cell recording method for mammalian cells or two-electrode voltage-clamp recording for Xenopus oocytes. Patch pipettes were pulled from thin-wall borosilicate glass capillaries (TW-150–4, World Precision Instruments) on a horizontal Flaming Brown micropipette puller (P-87, Sutter Instruments, Inc.). When filled with pipette solutions, the resistance of the patch pipettes was in a range of 3–5 MΩ for patch-clamp recordings from CHO cells. Currents were sampled at a rate of 125 μs per point and filtered by a low-pass Bessel filter set at 1 kHz. Data were acquired and stored on either a Pentium II computer (Dell) or a Power Macintosh (7500/120) using an EPC-9 amplifier and HEKA Pulse version 8.0 software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Membrane currents were both leak- and capacity-subtracted online with a p/4 subtraction protocol. Further analyses of data and preparation of figures were accomplished with the program suite, Igor Pro version 3.0 (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR), Microsoft Excel, and Origin (MicroCal) software. Solutions and Chemicals—For patch clamp, the pipette solution used in this study contained 145 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgATP. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The bath solution was made from modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (10× liquid, Invitrogen) and consisted of 5.4 mm KCl, 136.9 mm NaCl, 0.34 mm NaHPO44·7H2O, 0.5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 0.41 mm MgSO2, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, and 0.01 g/liter phenol red. NaOH was used to adjust the pH to 7.3. For Xenopus oocyte recordings, the electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl solution, with resistances ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mΩ. The bath solution of pH 7.4 was an “ND96” containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. Erb (purchased from Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO as a stock solution (50 mm). The final vehicle concentration was below 0.25%, at which Me2SO did not have any effect upon the membrane currents. Compounds were applied to the cells by means of a fast bath perfusion system (BPS-8, Adams & List Associates Ltd.), and a bath solution change was completed within 10 s. Data Analysis—Current amplitude was measured online using a HEKA Pulse version 8.5 software. Mono-exponential fits in the HEKA Pulse Fit or Origin were applied to obtain activation, inactivation, and deactivation time constants (τa, τi, and τd). Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E., and the paired Student's t test was performed. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. In the following text, we designate the compound methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate as Erb to distinguish from it other analogues in our company's compound library. Our data indicated that Erb nearly abolished the N-type inactivation of a Kv1.4 channel expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 1, b–d), resulting in a drastic increase in the sustained current amplitude at all test potentials. In six cells, Erb (50 μm) increased the inactivation time constant of 86.5 ± 9.5 to 150 ± 10 ms (p < 0.0 1). The I/V plots in Fig. 1d clearly show that the peak currents measured in the absence (□, control) and presence (▵) of 50 μm Erb are virtually the same. In contrast, the sustained current measured at the end of the depolarization pulses was drastically increased by Erb (▴ versus ○). Because the phenomenon of the fast closing and thus transient opening of the A-type K channels is known as “inactivation,” the disruption and reversal of the inactivation is designated here as disinactivation. Agents such as Erb that cause disinactivation are therefore designated as disinactivators. To rule out the possibility that host cells may play a role in the Erb-induced disinactivation, we have used both CHO cells and Xenopus oocytes in the following experiments. Because the results were very similar, only one set of data was used in some figures. As mentioned above, there are several genes that encode the A-type K channels. The inactivation mechanisms of these A-type channels differ. The best known examples are the so-called N-type inactivation because the inactivation machinery involves some 20–50 amino acid residuals in the N terminus of the Kvα-subunits (12Pongs O. Phys. Rev. 1992; 72: S69-S88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It is also well established that some Kvβ-subunits (such as Kvβ1), when co-expressed with certain Kv channels, can confer the N-type inactivation mechanism to some otherwise non-inactivating Kv channels such as the “delayed rectifier” type Kv1.1 (4Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 14Pongs O. Leicher T. Berger M. Roeper J. Bahring R. Wray D. Giese K.P. Silva A.J. Storm J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, experiments were designed to test whether Erb would disinactivate these converted A-channels. As shown in Fig. 2b, when Kv1.1 and Kvβ1 were co-expressed in CHO cells (and in Xenopus oocytes), a mixture of inactivating and non-inactivating currents was recorded. When Erb was applied to the bath solution, the amplitude of both the peak and sustained currents was increased with an apparent slow-down of the inactivation. Erb reached its maximum disinactivation within 15 min after being applied to the bath. Similar to what happened with Kv1.4, Erb (50 μm) increased the inactivation time constant of Kv1.1+Kvβ1 from 10 ± 0.9 to 49.3 ± 7 ms (n = 7, p < 0.01). Because of the difficulties in retaining the inactivation properties using mutated A-channels, we chose to test Erb on Kv1.1α-subunits expressed alone in CHO cells and Xenopus oocytes. When expressed alone, Kv1.1α-subunits form non-inactivating delayed rectifier-type channels. In this case, Erb had no effect upon the kinetics (data not shown). The evidence shown so far suggests that Erb disinactivates Kv channels that bear the N-type inactivation mechanisms and does not affect the kinetics of the non-inactivating delayed rectifier K channels (such as Kv1.1). To test whether the Erb-induced disinactivation is specific only to the A-channels that exploit N-type inactivation, we performed experiments on another group (Kv4) of A-channels that inactivate without having a major N-type inactivation machinery in their α-subunits (15Jerng H.H. Shahidullah M. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 641-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Jerng H.H. Covarrubias M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 163-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, d and e show a representative Kv4 member, Kv4.3 channel current, recorded from a Xenopus oocyte. The currents inactivate by over 80% during the 400-ms depolarization pulses. When Erb (up to 200 μm) was applied to the bath solution, neither the peak amplitude nor the inactivation kinetic was affected (n = 3). Hitherto we have provided evidence (see above) to suggest that Erb selectively disrupts the N-type inactivation of Kv1.4 and Kv1.1/Kvβ1 channels. In contrast, the delayed rectifier Kv1.1 alone or another A-type channel, Kv4.3, that does not follow the N-type inactivating scheme, is not affected by Erb. The N-type inactivation utilizes the so-called ball-and-chain mechanism (5Zagotta W. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 17Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The data suggest that Erb may interfere selectively with the ball-and-chain N-type inactivation. It is well known that N-type inactivation is prevented by oxidation of the cysteine residuals on the channel protein. This oxidation results in the formation of disulfide-bonds between the ball structure and the channel body, which immobilizes the ball and chain on the N terminus of the channel, thereby leaving the channel open without inactivation (18Stephens G.J. Owen D.G. Robertson B. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. 1996; 431: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Ruppersberg J. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To test whether the effect of Erb is by means of cysteine oxidation, we used two cysteine-specific oxidizing agents, 2,2′-dithiobis-5-nitropyridine (DTBNP) and chloramine-T (18Stephens G.J. Owen D.G. Robertson B. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. 1996; 431: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DT-BNP (50 μm) virtually abolished the inactivation of Kv1.4 immediately after the agent reached the bath (in a matter of milliseconds). The effect of DTBNP could be reversed readily by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 3, a and b). CL-T at 500 μm also abolished the inactivation of Kv1.4 and was readily reversible by DTT as reported previously (Ref. 18Stephens G.J. Owen D.G. Robertson B. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. 1996; 431: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and data not shown). When Erb was applied to the bath, however, the onset of its action on the channel inactivation was slower compared with that with DTBNP or CL-T (Fig. 3d). In the presence of Erb, DTT did not produce any effect upon the channel inactivation, suggesting that redox-regulation and the disulfide bond formation between the cysteine residuals are not involved in the Erb-induced disinactivation of A-type K channels. It is noteworthy that, for some unknown reason(s), DTT alone does produce minor inhibitory effects on the current peak amplitude (Fig. 3, a and c). Moreover, preliminary site-directed mutation of the cysteine at position 7 to serine in the rat Kvβ1 polypeptide creates a subunit that induces rapid inactivation of Kv1.1 channels, but this inactivation is no longer sensitive to the effects of oxidants such as H2O2 (4Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). As a final control to ensure that the effects of the Erb analog disinactivator compounds (from our own library) were not due to redox modulation of this critical C7 residue, we coexpressed the Kvβ1C7S mutant with Kv1.1 in Xenopus oocytes. Application of an Erb analog disinactivator compound to oocytes expressing this mutant subunit caused disinactivation similar to that of the wild-type channels. 2K. J. Rhodes and Q. Wang, unpublished data. Thus the Erb analog disinactivator compound does not seem to disinactivate A-channels by oxidizing their N-terminals. Because Erb is a known tyrosine kinase inhibitor and because tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in Kv channel kinetics (20Murakoshi H. Shi G. Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Wang Q. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22Encinar J. Fernandez A.M.

Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we next performed experiments using a specific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and other nonspecific but potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to see whether the tyrosine kinase pathway was involved in the Erb-induced K channel disinactivation. As shown in Fig. 4a, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate alone (0.5 mm) had no effect upon the A-type voltage-gated K channel (Kv1.1+Kvβ1). At the same concentration, sodium orthovanadate alone did not affect the inactivation of Kv1.4 either (not shown here). In the continued presence of sodium orthovanadate, the Erb-induced disinactivation was not affected (Fig. 4a), suggesting that the Erb-induced disinactivation may not involve a protein tyrosine kinase pathway. To further support this hypothesis, we have tested several other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have different structures. These include genistein, tyrphostin 25, levendustin A, and herbimycin A. None of these potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors produced any Erb-like effects upon channel inactivation. These inhibitors not only have different structures compared with Erb but also work through different mechanisms to inhibit protein tyrosine kinases (e.g. compete with ATP, or their substrates, or both). As can be seen from Fig. 4b, the potent protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor levendustin A had virtually no effect upon channel inactivation. Although Erb and vanadate have been shown to be very selective on tyrosine kinase pathway over the protein kinase C or protein kinase A pathway, we have performed some pilot experiments in the presence of a nonspecific protein kinase C and protein kinase A inhibitor, H7. As illustrated in Fig. 4c, H7 (20 μm) was applied both in the bath and intracellularly (included in the pipette solution). H7 alone did not have a significant impact upon channel inactivation. In the presence of H7, the Erb-induced channel disinactivation was not affected, which suggests that the protein kinase C or protein kinase A pathway may not be involved in the Erb-induced disinactivation. In the present study, we have shown that Erb selectively interacts with the N-type inactivation of voltage-gated K channels, an effect we call disinactivation. It has also been demonstrated that the Erb-induced disinactivation is not mediated by oxidation or by means of a tyrosine kinase pathway. We propose that Erb may interfere with the channel inactivation machinery directly, and the effect might be either on the channel N-terminal “ball” peptide (involving the first 20 amino acids) or on the “receptor” site on the S4-S5 loop of the Kv channels (2Isacoff E. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there might be at least three possible binding sites on the channel: the S4-S5 loop as the receptor site for the ball peptides, the α ball, and/or the β ball peptides per se. Given the fact that there is very little homology between the Kv1.4 N-terminal ball structure and the Kvβ1 ball structure, the action site is highly likely to be located near the receptor site on the S4-S5 loop of the Kv α-subunits. Binding of a small molecule disinactivator such as Erb to the ball peptides might reduce the flexibility of the ball-and-chain machinery, which makes it impossible for the ball peptides to reach their binding sites at the S4-S5 loop. Alternatively, binding of Erb to the S4-S5 loop alone may prevent the ball peptides from interacting with this intracellular loop, leaving the gate either fully open or “ajar.” The Erb-induced disinactivation on the voltage-gated K channel can prolong the opening of these K channels, thereby reducing the neuronal excitation and neurotransmitter releases. Agents that mimic this type of disinactivation are designated as disinactivators here. We reason that disinactivators are the first class of small molecules that interfere with the protein-protein interaction for the ball-and-chain in N-type inactivation. These disinactivators, therefore, would be useful for treating disorders such as epilepsy and stroke. Furthermore, we found that those Erb analogue disinactivators mimic the effects of Erb upon the N-type inactivation and are efficacious in two in vivo seizure models: the maximum electric shock-induced seizures and the picrotoxin-induced seizures.2 The striking notion is that most of the currently marketed anticonvulsant drugs worked only in one of the seizure models. Therefore, small molecule K channel disinactivators represent a new class of antiseizure drugs, and these drugs can be expected to be more efficacious and to have less severe side effects.
