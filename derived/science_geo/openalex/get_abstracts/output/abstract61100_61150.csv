https://openalex.org/W2007901434,"An automatic procedure providing information about human systolic blood pressure at each successive heartbeat under routine laboratory conditions is described. Twenty normal male subjects were given feedback of their own systolic pressure, half operantly reinforced for increasing and half reinforced for decreasing their pressure. Significant differences in pressure were obtained in a single session. The apparatus and results suggest a possible approach to the treatment of essential hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1579897247,"The complete amino acid sequence of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) from Escherichia coli has been established. It contains 77 residues with NH2-terminal serine and COOH-terminal alanine. The pantotheine prosthetic group of ACP is attached covalently to the hydroxyl group of serine at residue 36, which is 1 of 3 seryl residues in the molecule. This unique sequence was deduced by sequence analysis of the tryptic, peptic, and thermolysin peptides isolated from enzymic hydrolysates of ACP as described earlier. Important overlaps in sequence were also obtained by partial sequence analysis of one of the two unique peptides formed on cleavage of ACP with CNBr, and by sequence analysis of a single tryptic peptide isolated from tryptic digests of ACP modified at its single arginyl residue with 1,2-cyclohexanedione."

Syncytial cells were rendered fluorescent with measles specific antiserums only, by means of an indirect technique. The ultrastructural appearance of the microtubular aggregates was identical in brain tissue and in the cultured cells. Fusion experiments produced a cytopathic effect in humnan embryonic kidney and VERO cell cultures. The virus was identified by hemiagglutination-inhibition, but only in the supernatant of disrupted cultured cells."

https://openalex.org/W145781558,"Abstract Peptides obtained by partial digestion of cytochrome c2 of Rhodospirillum rubrum with chymotrypsin and pepsin, as well as by BrCN fragmentation and dilute acid cleavage, have been purified and their sequences have been determined. This additional information, together with earlier results obtained by digestion with trypsin and thermolysin, has permitted positive assignment of all 112 amino acid residues to unique positions in the molecule. Substantial homology between the sequence proposed for cytochrome c2 and the primary structures of mammalian cytochromes c is apparent. The relationship of all of these heme-proteins to cytochrome c of Pseudomonas fluorescens is considered. Internal homology in cytochrome c2 of R. rubrum is demonstrated for about 83% of the molecule, suggesting evolution of this protein from a small, repeating peptide unit."

These observations confirm previous results involving destructive lesions and establish the ventromedial nucleus as a hypothalamic locus involved in the control of growth hormone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1968242534,The concentration of factor VIII and partial thromboplastin times became normal and have remained normal for 140 days after orthotopic tranplantation of a normal liver to a hemophilic dog. Transplantation of a normal spleen into a hemophilic recipient did not result in a significant increase in factor VIII although the splenic graft was viable for at least 47 days. Transplantation of normal marrow to a lethally irradiated hemophilic dog did not result in an increase in factor VIII during 34 days of observation.
https://openalex.org/W1601079487,"Abstract The inability of a particular Escherichia coli mutant to form colonies on fructose minimal medium is ascribed to the inhibition of growth by glucose 6-phosphate, which accumulates in this strain from a small amount of glucose in the fructose. This explanation requires that fructose metabolism not be initiated by its phosphorylation to fructose 6-phosphate. Experiments in vitro show that fructose is phosphorylated to fructose 1-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system. Fructose 1-phosphate is converted to fructose 1,6-diphosphate by an inducible kinase, as has been found in other organisms. Thus, fructose should be considered a gluconeogenic carbon source in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1532616066,"Abstract When ribosomes are incubated with transferase II, guanosine triphosphate, and a sulfhydryl compound, ribosomes can be isolated which carry out aminoacyl transfer in the presence of transferase I, 14C-aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid, and GTP, but in the absence of added transferase II. The initial rate of aminoacyl transfer with isolated ribosome-transferase II complex is markedly stimulated compared to that with nonpreincubated ribosomes. Binding of transferase II to ribosomes can be obtained with GTP at 4°, or with 5'-guanylyl methylenediphosphonate or GDP at 37°; however, under these conditions, the initial rates of aminoacyl transfer with isolated ribosome-transferase II complex are not stimulated unless the complex is incubated briefly with GTP prior to the aminoacyl transfer reaction. The kinetics exhibited by the ribosome-transferase II complex formed in the presence of GTP at 37° appears to be due to the priming of ribosomes for the rapid acceptance of the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA; this process could reflect translocation of endogenous peptidyl-tRNA from the aminoacyl to the peptidyl site, making additional sites available for the binding and incorporation of aminoacyl-tRNA. Binding of transferase II to ribosomes and the translocation reaction are two distinct steps that can be dissociated from each other. The formation of ribosome-transferase II complex can be obtained in the absence of translocation. If translocation is allowed to occur, an aminoacyl-tRNA can be bound in the presence of transferase I, and a peptide bond can be formed, even after removal of the bound transferase II from the ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W1504469181,"Abstract The peptides obtained by reaction of trypsin, pepsin, and thermolysin on the acyl carrier protein of Escherichia coli have been purified by means of ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and differential solubility. The tryptic peptides from performic acid-oxidized acyl carrier protein were obtained in yields from 51 to 98%. The sum of the amino compositions of the tryptic peptides accounts for the amino acid composition of the intact protein. One tryptic peptide, which contains 43 of the 77 residues in acyl carrier protein, was degraded with pepsin and the resulting peptic peptides were isolated in yields from 75 to 100%. These peptides, in addition to those from thermolysin digests of acyl carrier protein, have provided the necessary overlaps in sequence that are required to deduce a partial amino acid sequence of acyl carrier protein."
https://openalex.org/W1556862302,"Abstract The interconversion of two conformations of tryptophan transfer RNA of Escherichia coli, Form I (native form) and Form II (denatured form), is a reversible, first order reaction. The two forms are metastable at low temperatures, and their interconversion is accelerated by increasing temperature. The free energy change of denaturation decreases with decreasing cation concentration and increasing temperature. Changes of enthalpy and entropy of denaturation and activation for both denaturation and renaturation are positive, indicating that breakage and formation of hydrogen-bonded base pairs and changes in base stacking are probably involved in the process of interconversion. High concentrations of monovalent cations favor Form I. On the other hand, low concentrations of monovalent cations favor Form II and competitively inhibit the production of Form I by divalent cations. The tryptophan tRNA in acidic buffer (pH 3.5 to 4.0) or in water is converted instantly to Form I when added to the acylation mixture. At equilibrium, the fractional amounts of Form I and Form II are independent of the tRNA concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1994454019,The nucleotide sequence of one of the Escherichia coli tyrosine-transfer ribonucleic acids was determined in order to compare its sequence with that of yeast tyrosine-transfer ribonucleic acid. Forty-four positions of both transfer ribonucleic acids are occupied by the same nucleotides if they are arranged in the manner shown here. The information obtained suggests that the conformation of transfer ribonucleic acid molecules may be a greater contributing factor than a specific nucleotide sequence in the interaction of transfer ribonucleic acid with its corresponding aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase.

Immullosuppression was present at all dosages, the most prolonged and consistent effect being observed at 300 micrograms per day. Grafts survived for 14 to 21 days at this dosage compared to 4 to 9 days for controls."

https://openalex.org/W1591008860,"Abstract When ribosomes are pretreated with transferase II and guanosine triphosphate, the binding of aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid to ribosomes in the presence of transferase I and the GTP analogue 5'-guanylyl methylenediphosphonate is markedly increased. Binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes is also obtained in the absence of transferase I and nucleotide when incubations are carried out in solutions containing high concentrations of MgCl2 (20 mm). The addition of nonenzymatically bound aminoacyl-tRNA or of puromycin to endogenous peptides is carried out in the absence of transfer factors or nucleotide by a ribosome-associated activity. When ribosomes are pretreated with transferase II and GTP, the amount of aminoacyl-tRNA that is bound nonenzymatically and then incorporated into a peptide-bound form is markedly increased. Concomitantly, the reaction of aminoacyl-tRNA with endogenous peptidyl-tRNA leads to a decrease in the amount of peptidyl-tRNA that can react with puromycin. These results suggest that (a) when transferase II and GTP interact with ribosomes additional sites for the enzymatic or nonenzymatic binding of aminoacyl-tRNA are made available because of the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the aminoacyl to the peptidyl site; consistent with this interpretation is the observation that puromycin incorporation is increased when ribosomes are incubated with transferase II and GTP; (b) binding of aminoacyl-tRNA and formation of a new peptide bond lead to a decrease in peptidyl-puromycin formation because the newly synthesized peptidyl-tRNA, one amino acid longer than the pre-existing endogenous one, remains at the site at which the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA was present. Thus, ribosome-bound peptidyl-tRNA occurs at the aminoacyl site as the product of peptide bond synthesis with aminoacyl-tRNA, or at the peptidyl site as the product of translocation. Transferase I and GTP are required for the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA, peptide bond synthesis is a ribosomal activity, and transferase II and GTP are required for translocation."

In the dark phase, the body wall's absorption of ultraviolet light and visible light was approximately twice that of the body wall in the light phase. The shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet could penetrate the body wall in the light phase but not in the dark phase. The intensity and wavelengths of light which could penetrate the body wall without pigments are potentially mutagenic when judged by bacterial standards."

https://openalex.org/W2034253943,"Serum from various animal species, including the test animals themselves, inhibits the antibody response of the rabbit to two bacterial antigens, provided that antigen and immunosuppressant interact prior to injection. The degree of immunosuppression is related to the length of incubation in vitro of antigen and serum. Serum does not hinder or destroy the antigenic determinant. Bacterial antibodies do not account for inhibition of the antibody response. Antigen-associated serum components, as yet unidentified, may affect the early events of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1643444583,"Abstract A system is described in which the addition of 5 S RNA stimulated incorporation of 14C-amino acids into protein directed by RNA from phage MS-2. Although the system is stimulated by the addition of 4 S RNA as well as by the addition of 5 S RNA, the maximum incorporation is obtained when both 4 S and 5 S RNA were added to the mixture. The transfer RNA contamination in the 5 S RNA preparation was negligible. The stimulatory effect of 5 S RNA is sensitive to ribonuclease treatment and is not reduced by phenol treatment of the 5 S RNA. No effect of 5 S RNA on polyphenylalanine formation under the direction of polyuridylic acid is observed. The stimulation by 5 S RNA is observed in the presence of various concentrations of magnesium ions and is not influenced by the addition of the formyl donor to the reaction mixture."
