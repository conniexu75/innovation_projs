https://openalex.org/W2783733493,"It is increasingly evident that cytokines and growth factors produced in the decidua play a pivotal role in the regulation of the local immune microenvironment and the establishment of pregnancy. One of the major growth factors produced in the decidua is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts not only on endothelial cells, but also on multiple other cell types, including macrophages. We sought to determine whether decidua-derived VEGF affects macrophage recruitment and polarization using human endometrial/decidual tissue samples, primary human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs), and the human monocyte cell line THP1. In situ hybridization was used for assessment of local VEGF expression and immunohistochemistry was used for identification and localization of CD68-positive endometrial macrophages. Macrophage migration in culture was assessed using a transwell migration assay, and the various M1/M2 phenotypic markers and VEGF expression were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We found dramatic increases in both VEGF levels and macrophage numbers in the decidua during early pregnancy compared to the secretory phase endometrium (non-pregnant), with a significant increase in M2 macrophage markers, suggesting that M2 is the predominant macrophage phenotype in the decidua. However, decidual samples from preeclamptic pregnancies showed a significant shift in macrophage phenotype markers, with upregulation of M1 and downregulation of M2 markers. In THP1 cultures, VEGF treatment significantly enhanced macrophage migration and induced M1 macrophages to shift to an M2 phenotype. Moreover, treatment with conditioned media from decidualized ESCs induced changes in macrophage migration and polarization similar to that of VEGF treatment. These effects were abrogated by the addition of a potent VEGF inhibitor. Together these results suggest that decidual VEGF plays a significant role in macrophage recruitment and M2 polarization, and that inhibition of VEGF signaling may contribute to the shift in macrophage polarity observed in different pregnancy disorders, including preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2782995834,"Background The prevalence of obesity, an important cardiometabolic risk factor, is rising in women. Lifestyle improvements are the first step in treatment of obesity, but the success depends on factors like timing and motivation. Women are especially receptive to advice about lifestyle before and during pregnancy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the pre-pregnancy period provides the perfect window of opportunity to improve cardiometabolic health and quality of life of obese infertile women, by means of a lifestyle intervention. Methods and findings Between 2009–2012, 577 infertile women between 18 and 39 years of age, with a Body Mass Index of ≥ 29 kg/m2, were randomized to a six month lifestyle intervention preceding infertility treatment, or to direct infertility treatment. The goal of the intervention was 5–10% weight loss or a BMI < 29 kg/m2. Cardiometabolic outcomes included weight, waist- and hip circumference, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, lipids and metabolic syndrome. All outcomes were measured by research nurses at randomization, 3 and 6 months. Self-reported quality of life was also measured at 12 months. Three participants withdrew their informed consent, and 63 participants discontinued the intervention program. Intention to treat analysis was conducted. Mixed effects regression models analyses were performed. Results are displayed as estimated mean differences between intervention and control group. Weight (-3.1 kg 95% CI: -4.0 to -2.2 kg; P < .001), waist circumference (-2.4 cm 95% CI: -3.6 to -1.1 cm; P < .001), hip circumference (-3.0 95% CI: -4.2 to -1.9 cm; P < .001), BMI (-1.2 kg/m2 95% CI: -1.5 to -0.8 kg/m2; P < .001), systolic blood pressure (-2.8 mmHg 95% CI: -5.0 to -0.7 mmHg; P = .01) and HOMA-IR (-0.5 95% CI: -0.8 to -0.1; P = .01) were lower in the intervention group compared to controls. Hs-CRP and lipids did not differ between groups. The odds ratio for metabolic syndrome in the intervention group was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.85; P < .01) compared to controls. Physical QoL scores were higher in the lifestyle intervention group (2.2 95% CI: 0.9 to 3.5; P = .001) while mental QoL scores did not differ. Conclusions In obese infertile women, a lifestyle intervention prior to infertility treatment improves cardiometabolic health and self-reported physical quality of life (LIFEstyle study: Netherlands Trial Register: NTR1530)."
https://openalex.org/W2783740858,"Aging or cerebral diseases may induce architectural modifications in human brain microvascular networks, such as capillary rarefaction. Such modifications limit blood and oxygen supply to the cortex, possibly resulting in energy failure and neuronal death. Modelling is key in understanding how these architectural modifications affect blood flow and mass transfers in such complex networks. However, the huge number of vessels in the human brain—tens of billions—prevents any modelling approach with an explicit architectural representation down to the scale of the capillaries. Here, we introduce a hybrid approach to model blood flow at larger scale in the brain microcirculation, based on its multiscale architecture. The capillary bed, which is a space-filling network, is treated as a porous medium and modelled using a homogenized continuum approach. The larger arteriolar and venular trees, which cannot be homogenized because of their fractal-like nature, are treated as a network of interconnected tubes with a detailed representation of their spatial organization. The main contribution of this work is to devise a proper coupling model at the interface between these two components. This model is based on analytical approximations of the pressure field that capture the strong pressure gradients building up in the capillaries connected to arterioles or venules. We evaluate the accuracy of this model for both very simple architectures with one arteriole and/or one venule and for more complex ones, with anatomically realistic tree-like vessels displaying a large number of coupling sites. We show that the hybrid model is very accurate in describing blood flow at large scales and further yields a significant computational gain by comparison with a classical network approach. It is therefore an important step towards large scale simulations of cerebral blood flow and lays the groundwork for introducing additional levels of complexity in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2783705268,"Honokiol (poly-phenolic lignan from Magnolia grandiflora) is a Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) activator which exhibit antioxidant activity and augment mitochondrial functions in several experimental models. Modern evidence suggests the critical role of SIRT3 in the progression of several metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Amyloid beta (Aβ), the precursor to extracellular senile plaques, accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is related to the development of cognitive impairment and neuronal cell death. Aβ is generated from amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages, first by β-secretase and then by γ-secretase. Drugs modulating this pathway are believed to be one of the most promising strategies for AD treatment. In the present study, we found that Honokiol significantly enhanced SIRT3 expression, reduced reactive oxygen species generation and lipid peroxidation, enhanced antioxidant activities, and mitochondrial function thereby reducing Aβ and sAPPβ levels in Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) cells (carrying the amyloid precursor protein-APP and Presenilin PS1 mutation). Mechanistic studies revealed that Honokiol affects neither protein levels of APP nor α-secretase activity. In contrast, Honokiol increased the expression of AMPK, CREB, and PGC-1α, thereby inhibiting β-secretase activity leading to reduced Aβ levels. These results suggest that Honokiol is an activator of SIRT3 capable of improving antioxidant activity, mitochondrial energy regulation, while decreasing Aβ, thereby indicating it to be a lead compound for AD drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2784009008,"Current influenza vaccines do not provide broad cross-protection. Here, we report that intranasal vaccination with virus-like particles containing the highly conserved multiple ectodomains of matrix protein 2 (M2e5x VLP) of influenza virus induces broad cross-protection by M2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. M2e5x VLP intranasal vaccination prevented severe weight loss, attenuated inflammatory cytokines and cellular infiltrates, and lowered viral loads, and induced germinal center phenotypic B and plasma cells. In addition, depletion studies demonstrate the protective roles of CD4 and CD8 T cells induced by M2e5x VLP intranasal vaccination. Thus, this study provides evidence that mucosal delivery of M2e5x VLP vaccine provides cross-protection by inducing humoral and cellular immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2783839593,"Increasing grain yield potential in wheat has been a major target of most breeding programs. Genetic advance has been frequently hindered by negative correlations among yield components that have been often observed in segregant populations and germplasm collections. A tetraploid wheat collection was evaluated in seven environments and genotyped with a 90K SNP assay to identify major and stable quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain yield per spike (GYS), kernel number per spike (KNS) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW), and to analyse the genetic relationships between the yield components at QTL level. The genome-wide association analysis detected eight, eleven and ten QTL for KNS, TKW and GYS, respectively, significant in at least three environments or two environments and the mean across environments. Most of the QTL for TKW and KNS were found located in different marker intervals, indicating that they are genetically controlled independently by each other. Out of eight KNS QTL, three were associated to significant increases of GYS, while the increased grain number of five additional QTL was completely or partially compensated by decreases in grain weight, thus producing no or reduced effects on GYS. Similarly, four consistent and five suggestive TKW QTL resulted in visible increase of GYS, while seven additional QTL were associated to reduced effects in grain number and no effects on GYS. Our results showed that QTL analysis for detecting TKW or KNS alleles useful for improving grain yield potential should consider the pleiotropic effects of the QTL or the association to other QTLs."
https://openalex.org/W2783505130,"Objectives Kenya is one of the first African countries to scale up a national HIV viral load monitoring program. We sought to assess program scale up using the national database and identify areas for systems strengthening. Methods Data from January 2012 to March 2016 were extracted from Kenya’s national viral load database. Characteristics of 1,108,356 tests were assessed over time, including reason for testing, turnaround times, test results, treatment regimens, and socio-demographic information. Results The number of facilities offering viral load testing increased to ~2,000 with >40,000 tests being conducted per month by 2016. By March 2016, most (84.2%) tests were conducted for routine monitoring purposes and the turnaround time from facility-level sample collection to result dispatch from the lab was 21(24) [median (IQR)] days. Although the proportions of repeat viral load tests increased over time, the volumes were lower than expected. Elevated viral load was much more common in pediatric and adolescent patients (0-<3 years: 43.1%, 3-<10 years: 34.5%, 10-<20 years: 36.6%) than in adults (30-<60 years: 13.3%; p<0.001). Conclusions Coverage of viral load testing dramatically increased in Kenya to >50% of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by early 2016 and represents a relatively efficient laboratory system. However, strengthening of patient tracking mechanisms and viral load result utilization may be necessary to further improve the system. Additional focus is needed on paediatric/adolescent patients to improve viral suppression in these groups. Kenya’s national viral load database has demonstrated its usefulness in assessing laboratory programs, tracking trends in patient characteristics, monitoring scale-up of new policies and programs, and identifying problem areas for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2783671622,"Obesity and accompanying metabolic disease is negatively correlated with lung health yet the exact mechanisms by which obesity affects the lung are not well characterized. Since obesity is associated with lung diseases as chronic bronchitis and asthma, we designed a series of experiments to measure changes in lung metabolism in mice fed obesogenic diets. Mice were fed either control or high fat/sugar diet (45%kcal fat/17%kcal sucrose), or very high fat diet (60%kcal fat/7% sucrose) for 150 days. We performed untargeted metabolomics by GC-TOFMS and HILIC-QTOFMS and lipidomics by RPLC-QTOFMS to reveal global changes in lung metabolism resulting from obesity and diet composition. From a total of 447 detected metabolites, we found 91 metabolite and lipid species significantly altered in mouse lung tissues upon dietary treatments. Significantly altered metabolites included complex lipids, free fatty acids, energy metabolites, amino acids and adenosine and NAD pathway members. While some metabolites were altered in both obese groups compared to control, others were different between obesogenic diet groups. Furthermore, a comparison of changes between lung, kidney and liver tissues indicated few metabolic changes were shared across organs, suggesting the lung is an independent metabolic organ. These results indicate obesity and diet composition have direct mechanistic effects on composition of the lung metabolome, which may contribute to disease progression by lung-specific pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2782691834,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a highly prevalent intestinal disorder for which no cure exists. Currently, the standard first-line treatment of IBD consists of systemic glucocorticoid (GC) application, even though therapy can be complicated by unresponsiveness or adverse effects. In view of the importance of macrophages and neutrophils for the pathogenesis of IBD we set out to define the relevance of these cell types as targets of GC using the mouse model of DSS-induced colitis. We found that the disease did not resolve in GRlysM mice lacking the GC receptor (GR) in myeloid cells after removal of the chemical insult. While clinical symptoms and tissue damage in the colon ameliorated again in GRflox mice, the disease further aggravated in GRlysM littermates. The observed difference coincided with an increased abundance of macrophages in inflammatory infiltrates in the colon of mutant mice whereas neutrophil and T cell numbers were similar. Concomitantly, systemic IL-6 secretion and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colon were elevated in GRlysM mice and gene expression of scavenger receptors and IL-10 was diminished. Taken together, our results reveal an important role of myeloid cells as targets of GC in DSS-induced colitis and probably in IBD in humans as well."
https://openalex.org/W2784274627,"Real-time positioning on mobile devices using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology paired with radio frequency (RF) transmission (GNSS-RF) may help to improve safety on logging operations by increasing situational awareness. However, GNSS positional accuracy for ground workers in motion may be reduced by multipath error, satellite signal obstruction, or other factors. Radio propagation of GNSS locations may also be impacted due to line-of-sight (LOS) obstruction in remote, forested areas. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of forest stand characteristics, topography, and other LOS obstructions on the GNSS accuracy and radio signal propagation quality of multiple Raveon Atlas PT GNSS-RF transponders functioning as a network in a range of forest conditions. Because most previous research with GNSS in forestry has focused on stationary units, we chose to analyze units in motion by evaluating the time-to-signal accuracy of geofence crossings in 21 randomly-selected stands on the University of Idaho Experimental Forest. Specifically, we studied the effects of forest stand characteristics, topography, and LOS obstructions on (1) the odds of missed GNSS-RF signals, (2) the root mean squared error (RMSE) of Atlas PTs, and (3) the time-to-signal accuracy of safety geofence crossings in forested environments. Mixed-effects models used to analyze the data showed that stand characteristics, topography, and obstructions in the LOS affected the odds of missed radio signals while stand variables alone affected RMSE. Both stand characteristics and topography affected the accuracy of geofence alerts."
https://openalex.org/W2782795093,"Up till now, studies have not been conducted on how the combination of Quercetin (Q), Aconitine (A) and apoptosis induction affects human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. The result of our findings shows that the combination of Q and A (QA) is capable of synergistically inhibiting the proliferation of HeLa cells in a number of concentrations. QA synergistically inhibits the proliferation of MDR1 gene in the HeLa cells. It is concluded based on our result that QA induces apoptosis and ER stress just as QA-induced ER stress pathway may mediate apoptosis by upregulating mRNA expression levels of eIF2α, ATF4, IRE1, XBP1, ATF6, PERK and CHOP in the HeLa cells. The up-regulating of mRNA expression level of GRP78 and activation of UPR are a molecular basis of QA-induced ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2784185971,"About 25–44% of women will experience at least one episode of recurrent UTI and the causative agent in over 70% of UTI cases is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC cause recurrent UTI by evading the bladder’s innate immune system through internalization into the bladder epithelium where antibiotics cannot reach or be effective. Thus, it is important to develop novel therapeutics to eliminate these intracellular pathogens. Nanodiamonds (NDs) are biocompatible nanomaterials that serve as promising candidates for targeted therapeutic applications. The objective of the current study was to investigate if 6 or 25 nm NDs can kill extracellular and intracellular UPEC in infected bladder cells. We utilized the human bladder epithelial cell line, T24, and an invasive strain of UPEC that causes recurrent UTI. We found that acid-purified 6 nm NDs displayed greater antibacterial properties towards UPEC than 25 nm NDs (11.5% vs 94.2% CFU/mL at 100 μg/mL of 6 and 25 nm, respectively; P<0.001). Furthermore, 6 nm NDs were better than 25 nm NDs in reducing the number of UPEC internalized in T24 bladder cells (46.1% vs 81.1% CFU/mL at 100 μg/mL of 6 and 25 nm, respectively; P<0.01). Our studies demonstrate that 6 nm NDs interacted with T24 bladder cells in a dose-dependent manner and were internalized in 2 hours through an actin-dependent mechanism. Finally, internalization of NDs was required for reducing the number of intracellular UPEC in T24 bladder cells. These findings suggest that 6 nm NDs are promising candidates to treat recurrent UTIs."
https://openalex.org/W2782974549,"Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare, locally aggressive, malignant neoplasm originating in the olfactory epithelium in the nasal vault. The recurrence rate of ONB remains high and there are no specific treatment guidelines for recurrent/metastatic ONBs. This study retrospectively evaluated 23 ONB samples profiled at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, Arizona) using DNA sequencing (Sanger/NGS [Illumina], n = 15) and gene fusions (Archer FusionPlex, n = 6), whole genome RNA microarray (HumanHT-12 v4 beadChip, Illumina, n = 4), gene copy number assays (chromogenic and fluorescent in situ hybridization), and immunohistochemistry. Mutations were detected in 63% ONBs including TP53, CTNNB1, EGFR, APC, cKIT, cMET, PDGFRA, CDH1, FH, and SMAD4 genes. Twenty-one genes were over-expressed and 19 genes under-expressed by microarray assay. Some of the upregulated genes included CD24, SCG2, and IGFBP-2. None of the cases harbored copy number variations of EGFR, HER2 and cMET genes, and no gene fusions were identified. Multiple protein biomarkers of potential response or resistance to classic chemotherapy drugs were identified, such as low ERCC1 [cisplatin sensitivity in 10/12], high TOPO1 [irinotecan sensitivity in 12/19], high TUBB3 [vincristine resistance in 13/14], and high MRP1 [multidrug resistance in 6/6 cases]. None of the cases (0/10) were positive for PD-L1 in tumor cells. Overexpression of pNTRK was observed in 67% (4/6) of the cases without underlying genetic alterations. Molecular alterations detected in our study (e.g., Wnt and cKIT/PDGFRA pathways) are potentially treatable using novel therapeutic approaches. Identified protein biomarkers of response or resistance to classic chemotherapy could be useful in optimizing existing chemotherapy treatment(s) in ONBs."

Fifty-nine EV-G sequences, which were >5,000 nucleotides long, were obtained. By complete VP1 sequence analysis, Japanese EV-G isolates were classified into G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), G10 (five strains), and a new genotype (one strain). Remarkably, 16 G1 and one G2 strain identified in diarrheic (23.5%; four strains) or normal (76.5%; 13 strains) fecal samples possessed a papain-like cysteine protease (PL-CP) sequence, which was recently found in the USA and Belgium in the EV-G genome, at the 2C-3A junction site. This paper presents the first report of the high prevalence of viruses carrying PL-CP in the EV-G population. Furthermore, possible inter- and intragenotype recombination events were found among EV-G strains, including G1-PL-CP strains. Our findings may advance the understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of EV-Gs."
https://openalex.org/W2784100015,"To evaluate unmet clinical need in unselected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients to determine the risk of a wide range of subsequent cardiovascular disease endpoints and safety endpoints relevant for trial design.Population based cohort (CALIBER, linked primary care, hospital and mortality records in England, period 1997-2010), all people diagnosed with HCM were identified and matched by age, sex and general practice with ten randomly selected people without HCM. Random-effects Poisson models were used to assess the associations between HCM and cardiovascular diseases and bleeding.Among 3,290,455 eligible people a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was found in 4 per 10,000. Forty-one percent of the 1,160 individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were women and the median age was 57 years. The median follow-up was 4.0 years. Compared to general population controls, people with HCM had higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia (incidence rate ratio = 23.53, [95% confidence interval 12.67-43.72]), cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death (6.33 [3.69-10.85]), heart failure (4.31, [3.30-5.62]), and atrial fibrillation (3.80 [3.04-4.75]). HCM was also associated with a higher incidence of myocardial infarction ([MI] 1.90 [1.27-2.84]) and coronary revascularisation (2.32 [1.46-3.69]).The absolute Kaplan-Meier risks at 3 years were 8.8% for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure, 8.4% for the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke or myocardial infarction, and 1.5% for major bleeding.Our study identified major unmet need in HCM and highlighted the importance of implementing improved cardiovascular prevention strategies to increase life-expectancy of the contemporary HCM population. They also show that national electronic health records provide an effective method for identifying outcomes and clinically relevant estimates of composite efficacy and safety endpoints essential for trial design in rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2782560573,"Mucocele formation is characterized by secretion of abnormally thick mucus by the gallbladder epithelium of dogs that may cause obstruction of the bile duct or rupture of the gallbladder. The disease is increasingly recognized and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The cause of gallbladder mucocele formation in dogs is unknown. There is a strong breed predisposition and affected dogs have a high incidence of concurrent endocrinopathy or hyperlipidemia. These observations suggest a significant influence of both genetic and metabolic factors on disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated a theory that mucocele formation is associated with a syndrome of metabolic disruption. We surmised that a global, untargeted metabolomics approach could provide unique insight into the systemic pathogenesis of gallbladder mucocele formation and identify specific compounds as candidate biomarkers or treatment targets. Moreover, concurrent examination of the serum and hepatic duct bile metabolome would enable the construction of mechanism-based theories or identification of specific compounds responsible for altered function of the gallbladder epithelium. Abnormalities observed in dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation, including a 33-fold decrease in serum adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), lower quantities of precursors required for synthesis of energy transporting nucleotides, and increases in citric acid cycle intermediates, suggest excess metabolic energy and a carbon surplus. Altered quantities of compounds involved in protein translation and RNA turnover, together with accumulation of gamma-glutamylated and N-acetylated amino acids in serum suggest abnormal regulation of protein and amino acid metabolism. Increases in lathosterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol suggest a primary increase in cholesterol synthesis and diversion to bile acid formation. A number of specific biomarker compounds were identified for their ability to distinguish between control dogs and those that formed a gallbladder mucocele. Particularly noteworthy was a significant decrease in quantity of biologically active compounds that stimulate biliary ductal fluid secretion including adenosine, cAMP, taurolithocholic acid, and taurocholic acid. These findings support the presence of significant metabolic disruption in dogs with mucocele formation. A targeted, quantitative analysis of the identified serum biomarkers is warranted to determine their utility for diagnosis of this disease. Finally, repletion of compounds whose biological activity normally promotes biliary ductal secretion should be examined for any therapeutic impact for resolution or prevention of mucocele formation."
https://openalex.org/W2782721069,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of sex hormones with anthropometry in a large population-based cohort, with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based sex hormone measurements and imaging markers.Cross-sectional data from 957 men and women from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) were used. Associations of a comprehensive panel of LCMS-measured sex hormones with anthropometric parameters, laboratory, and imaging markers were analyzed in multivariable regression models for the full sample and stratified by sex. Sex hormone measures included total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (fT), estrone and estradiol, androstenedione (ASD), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Domains of anthropometry included physical measures (body-mass-index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-height-ratio, waist-to-hip-ratio, and hip circumference), laboratory measures of adipokines (leptin and vaspin), and magnet resonance imaging-based measures (visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue).In men, inverse associations between all considered anthropometric parameters with TT were found: BMI (β-coefficient, standard error (SE): -0.159, 0.037), waist-circumference (β-coefficient, SE: -0.892, 0.292), subcutaneous adipose tissue (β-coefficient, SE: -0.156, 0.023), and leptin (β-coefficient, SE: -0.046, 0.009). In women TT (β-coefficient, SE: 1.356, 0.615) and estrone (β-coefficient, SE: 0.014, 0.005) were positively associated with BMI. In analyses of variance, BMI and leptin were inversely associated with TT, ASD, and DHEAS in men, but positively associated with estrone. In women, BMI and leptin were positively associated with all sex hormones.The present population-based study confirmed and extended previously reported sex-specific associations between sex hormones and various anthropometric markers of overweight and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2783482110,"Under acidic conditions, aluminum (Al) toxicity is an important factor limiting plant productivity; however, the application of phosphorus (P) might alleviate the toxic effects of Al. In this study, seedlings of two vegetatively propagated Eucalyptus clones, E. grandis × E. urophylla 'G9' and E. grandis × E. urophylla 'DH32-29'were subjected to six treatments (two levels of Al stress and three levels of P). Under excessive Al stress, root Al content was higher, whereas shoot and leaf Al contents were lower with P application than those without P application. Further, Al accumulation was higher in the roots, but lower in the shoots and leaves of G9 than in those of DH32-29. The secretion of organic acids was higher under Al stress than under no Al stress. Further, under Al stress, the roots of G9 secreted more organic acids than those of DH32-29. With an increase in P supply, Al-induced secretion of organic acids from roots decreased. Under Al stress, some enzymes, including PEPC, CS, and IDH, played important roles in organic acid biosynthesis and degradation. Thus, our results indicate that P can reduce Al toxicity via the fixation of elemental Al in roots and restriction of its transport to stems and leaves, although P application cannot promote the secretion of organic acid anions. Further, the higher Al-resistance of G9 might be attributed to the higher Al accumulation in and organic acid anion secretion from roots and the lower levels of Al in leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2783212137,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important health issue with high mortality. Various complications of physiological and cognitive impairment may result in disability or death after TBI. Grouping of these complications could be treated as integrated post-TBI syndromes. To improve risk estimation, grouping TBI complications should be investigated, to better predict TBI mortality. This study aimed to estimate mortality risk based on grouping of complications among TBI patients. Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database was used in this study. TBI was defined according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes: 801-804 and 850-854. The association rule data mining method was used to analyze coexisting complications after TBI. The mortality risk of post-TBI complication sets with the potential risk factors was estimated using Cox regression. A total 139,254 TBI patients were enrolled in this study. Intracerebral hemorrhage was the most common complication among TBI patients. After frequent item set mining, the most common post-TBI grouping of complications comprised pneumonia caused by acute respiratory failure (ARF) and urinary tract infection, with mortality risk 1.55 (95% C.I.: 1.51-1.60), compared with those without the selected combinations. TBI patients with the combined combinations have high mortality risk, especially those aged <20 years with septicemia, pneumonia, and ARF (HR: 4.95, 95% C.I.: 3.55-6.88). We used post-TBI complication sets to estimate mortality risk among TBI patients. According to the combinations determined by mining, especially the combination of septicemia with pneumonia and ARF, TBI patients have a 1.73-fold increased mortality risk, after controlling for potential demographic and clinical confounders. TBI patients aged<20 years with each combination of complications also have increased mortality risk. These results could provide physicians and caregivers with important information to increase their awareness about sequences of clinical syndromes among TBI patients, to prevent possible deaths among these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2783218264,"Complex behavioral traits, such as those making up a migratory phenotype, are regulated by multiple environmental factors and multiple genes. We investigated possible relationships between microsatellite variation at two candidate genes implicated in the control of migratory behavior, Clock and Adcyap1, and several aspects of migratory life-history and evolutionary divergence in the Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), a species that shows wide variation in migratory and molting strategies across a disjunct distribution. We focused on Clock and Adcyap1 microsatellite variation across three Painted Bunting populations in Oklahoma, Louisiana, and North Carolina, and for the Oklahoma breeding population we used published migration tracking data on adult males to explore phenotypic variation in individual migratory behavior. We found no correlation between microsatellite allele size within either Clock and Adcyap1 relative to the initiation or duration of fall migration in adult males breeding in Oklahoma. We also show the lack of significant correlations with aspects of the migratory phenotype for the Louisiana population. Our research highlights the limitations of studying microsatellite allelic mutations that are of undetermined functional influence relative to complex behavioral phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2783966740,"Organic farming aims to reduce the effect on the ecosystem and enhance biodiversity in agricultural areas, but the long-term effectiveness of its application is unclear. Assessments have rarely included various taxonomic groups with different ecological and economic roles. In paddy fields with different numbers of years elapsed since the transition from conventional to organic farming, we investigated changes in the abundance of insect pests, generalist predators, and species of conservation concern. The abundance of various arthropods exhibited diverse trends with respect to years elapsed since the transition to organic farming. Larval lepidopterans, Tetragnatha spiders, and some planthoppers and stink bugs showed non-linear increases over time, eventually reaching saturation, such as the abundance increasing for several years and then becoming stable after 10 years. This pattern can be explained by the effects of residual pesticides, the lag time of soil mineralization, and dispersal limitation. A damselfly (Ischnura asiatica) did not show a particular trend over time, probably due to its rapid immigration from source habitats. Unexpectedly, both planthoppers and some leafhoppers exhibited gradual decreases over time. As their abundances were negatively related to the abundance of Tetragnatha spiders, increased predation by natural enemies might gradually decrease these insect populations. These results suggest that the consideration of time-dependent responses of organisms is essential for the evaluation of the costs and benefits of organic farming, and such evaluations could provide a basis for guidelines regarding the length of time for organic farming to restore biodiversity or the economic subsidy needed to compensate for pest damage."
https://openalex.org/W2784090866,"Early life stress (ELS) induces long-term effects in later functioning and interacts with further exposure to other stressors in adulthood to shape our responsiveness to reward-related cues. The attribution of incentive salience to food-related cues may be modulated by previous and current exposures to stressors in a sex-dependent manner. We hypothesized from human data that exposure to a traumatic (severe) adult stressor will decrease the attribution of incentive salience to reward-associated cues, especially in females, because these effects are modulated by previous ELS. To study these factors in Long-Evans rats, we used as an ELS model of restriction of nesting material and concurrently evaluated maternal care. In adulthood, the offspring of both sexes were exposed to acute immobilization (IMO), and several days after, a Pavlovian conditioning procedure was used to assess the incentive salience of food-related cues. Some rats developed more attraction to the cue predictive of reward (sign-tracking) and others were attracted to the location of the reward itself, the food-magazine (goal-tracking). Several dopaminergic markers were evaluated by in situ hybridization. The results showed that ELS increased maternal care and decreased body weight gain (only in females). Regarding incentive salience, in absolute control animals, females presented slightly greater sign-tracking behavior than males. Non-ELS male rats exposed to IMO showed a bias towards goal-tracking, whereas in females, IMO produced a bias towards sign-tracking. Animals of both sexes not exposed to IMO displayed an intermediate phenotype. ELS in IMO-treated females was able to reduce sign-tracking and decrease tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the ventral tegmental area and dopamine D1 receptor expression in the accumbens shell. Although the predicted greater decrease in females in sign-tracking after IMO exposure was not corroborated by the data, the results highlight the idea that sex is an important factor in the study of the long-term impact of early and adult stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2784222324,"Background Clinical and epidemiological studies of older persons have implicated clusterin in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In the context of identifying early biomarkers of risk, we examined associations of plasma clusterin and characteristics of AD in middle-aged individuals from the community. Materials and methods Subjects were 639 cognitively normal individuals (mean age 50 ± 3.5) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Brain MRI sub-study. Clusterin was quantified using ELISA (mean 255± 31 ng/ml). Associations were assessed between clusterin and volumes of brain regions known to atrophy in early AD, including entorhinal cortex (ECV), hippocampus (HV), and medial temporal lobe (MTLV) volumes (cm3). Total brain volume (TBV) and volumes of structures affected in later AD were examined for comparison. Results In multivariable models, higher clusterin had a negative non-linear association with ECV (combined left and right hemispheres), and this association was influenced by the highest clusterin levels. Compared to mean clusterin, 1 and 2 standard deviation (SD) level increases in clusterin were associated with -2.1% (95% CI: -3.3,-0.9) and -7.3% (95% CI: -11.3,-3.3) lower ECV, respectively. Similar relationships were observed between clusterin and HV, although the relationship was stronger for left-side HV than the right-side. However, the association was not significant after adjusting for covariates. Negative non-linear associations between clusterin and MTLV were strongest for the left side: compared to mean clusterin, 1 and 2 SD level increases in clusterin were associated with -0.9% (95% CI: -1.9, 0.1) and -3.7% (95% CI: -7.1, -0.3) lower MTLV. There were no significant associations between clusterin and brain structures affected in later AD. Conclusions In middle-aged adults unselected for AD, plasma clusterin was associated with lower volume of the entorhinal cortex, an area that atrophies early in AD. Clusterin could be informative as part of a multi-component preclinical marker for AD."

Here we analyze factors associated with its occurrence and the spectrum of bacterial pathogens identified in the group of patients followed at the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw. Methods Clinic database collected all medical information on patients routinely followed since 1994 to 2015. All patients with available urine culture were included into analyses, only the first culture was included. In statistical analyses logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with positive culture. Results In total 608 patients had urine culture performed, 176 (28.9%) were females and 432 (71,1%) were males, 378 (62.2%) registered in care before/in 2007, 258 (42.4%) infected through homosexual contact. Median baseline lymphocyte CD4+ count was 385 (IQR:204–565) cells/μl and median nadir lymphocyte CD4+ count 197 (86–306) cells/μl. One hundred and eighteen patients were actively infected with HCV, as defined by positive real-time PCR. In total 141 (23.2%) patients had positive urine culture, the most common bacterial pathogen was E.coli (58.2%) and E. faecalis (12.8%). Patients with urinary tract infection were more likely to be female (51.8% vs. 22.1%, p<0.0001), infected through other than homosexual mode (80.1% vs. 50.7%, p<0.0001), with lower nadir CD4 count (139 vs. 221 cells/μl, p<0.0001) and lower baseline HIV RNA (4.02 vs. 4.35 log copies/ml, p = 0.01) and less likely to be HCV RNA positive (26.9% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.01). In multivariate regression model being registered before/in 2007 (OR = 2.10; [95%CI: 1.24–3.56]), infected through other than homosexual mode (2.05;[1.18–3.56]) and female gender (2.14;[1.33–3.44]) were increasing and higher nadir CD4+ count decreasing (0.92;[0.85–0.99]) the odds of urinary tract infection. Conclusions We have identified that almost one third of patients had urinary tract infections with non-typical bacterial pathogens. Population with increased odds of urinary tract infections are women, patients infected through other than homosexual contacts and those registered before 2007."
https://openalex.org/W2783477151,"Background and aims A ceruloplasmin (CP) concentration <200 mg/L is conventionally considered as one of the major diagnostic criteria for Wilson’s disease (WD). However, the diagnostic accuracy of this threshold has never been investigated in a sufficiently large group of patients. This study aims to present the results of serum CP measurements in various patients and to identify the optimal cutoff value of CP for the diagnosis of WD. Materials and methods We identified patients whose CP levels were evaluated from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 using a laboratory information database. Data related to CP measurement were retrieved. We carefully reviewed patients’ electronic medical records to correct errors and to obtain other necessary data. Data related to WD were retrieved from a special document containing medical records of patients with WD, which were created, modified, and maintained by authors. Results CP level was determined in 4048 patients (WD, 297; non-WD, 3751). The mean serum CP level in patients with WD was 50.6±44.2 mg/L, which was significantly lower than that in non-WD patients (293.2±117.3 mg/L, p<0.001). Only 1.0% of patients with WD had CP ≥200 mg/L. The sensitivity and specificity of CP for the diagnosis of WD were 99.0 and 80.9%, respectively, for the conventional cutoff value <200 mg/L and 95.6 and 95.5%, respectively, for the cutoff value <150 mg/L; the latter provided a higher diagnostic accuracy for WD. 53.0% of patients with liver failure, 37.7% of patients with nephrotic syndrome, and 23.0% of patients age 1 to 6 months had serum CP <200 mg/L. Patients who were pregnant and those with malignant tumors, and infectious and inflammatory diseases had significantly higher mean serum CP levels. Conclusion The optimal cutoff value of CP for the diagnosis of WD in China is 150 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 95.5%, thereby providing the highest diagnostic accuracy for WD."
https://openalex.org/W2783784968,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming one of the world's most common chronic liver diseases in childhood, yet no therapy is available that has been approved by the food and drug administration (FDA). Previous studies have reported that telomere and telomerase are involved the development and progression of NAFLD. This study was designed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of activated carbon N-acetylcysteine (ACNAC) microcapsules on the development of NAFLD in young rats as well as the underlying mechanism(s) involved. Three-week old male Sprague Dawley rats were given high-fat diet (HFD) with/without ACNAC treatment for 7 consecutive weeks. Liver pathologies were determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Oil Red O staining, as well as by changes in biochemical parameters of plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, respectively. Glucose homeostasis was evaluated by the glucose tolerance test and the liver telomere length and activity were measured by real time PCR and telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). Western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression level of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3. Our results demonstrated that ACNAC supplementation improved liver pathologies of rats that received long-term HFD feeding. ACNAC supplementation prevented HFD-induced telomere shortening and improved telomerase activity. Moreover, in comparison to HFD-fed rats, ACNAC supplementation markedly increased the expression of Bcl-2, but significantly decreased the expression of Bax and Caspase-3 in juvenile rats. Together, these results indicate that ACNAC may be a promising choice for preventing and treating NAFLD among children."
https://openalex.org/W2782575404,"The transcription factor MAFB is an important regulator of the development and differentiation of various organs and tissues. Previous studies have shown that MAFB is expressed in embryonic and adult mouse testes and is expected to act as the downstream target of retinoic acid (RA) to initiate spermatogenesis. However, its exact localization and function remain unclear. Here, we localized MAFB expression in embryonic and adult testes and analyzed its gene function using Mafb-deficient mice. We found that MAFB and c-MAF are the only large MAF transcription factors expressed in testes, while MAFA and NRL are not. MAFB was localized in Leydig and Sertoli cells at embryonic day (E) 18.5 but in Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and pachytene spermatocytes in adults. Mafb-deficient testes at E18.5 showed fully formed seminiferous tubules with no abnormal structure or differences in testicular somatic cell numbers compared with those of control wild-type mice. Additionally, the expression levels of genes related to development and function of testicular cells were unchanged between genotypes. In adults, the expression of MAFB in Sertoli cells was shown to be stage specific and induced by RA. By generating Mafbfl/fl CAG-CreER™ (Mafb-cKO) mice, in which Cre recombinase was activated upon tamoxifen treatment, we found that the neonatal cKO mice died shortly upon Mafb deletion, but adult cKO mice were alive upon deletion. Adult cKO mice were fertile, and spermatogenesis maintenance was normal, as indicated by histological analysis, hormone levels, and germ cell stage-specific markers. Moreover, there were no differences in the proportion of seminiferous stages between cKO mice and controls. However, RNA-Seq analysis of cKO Sertoli cells revealed that the down-regulated genes were related to immune function and phagocytosis activity but not spermatogenesis. In conclusion, we found that MAFB is dispensable for fetal testis morphogenesis and spermatogenesis maintenance in adult mice, despite the significant gene expression in different cell types, but MAFB might be critical for phagocytosis activity of Sertoli cells."
https://openalex.org/W2782953342,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the macrophage-tropic pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is a highly prevalent infectious disease. Since an immune correlate of protection or effective vaccine have yet to be found, continued research into host-pathogen interactions is important. Previous literature reports links between host iron status and disease outcome for many infections, including TB. For some extracellular bacteria, the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin is essential for protection against infection. Here, we investigated hepcidin (encoded by Hamp1) in the context of murine M.tb infection. Female C57BL/6 mice were infected with M.tb Erdman via aerosol. Hepatic expression of iron-responsive genes was measured by qRT-PCR and bacterial burden determined in organ homogenates. We found that hepatic Hamp1 mRNA levels decreased post-infection, and correlated with a marker of BMP/SMAD signalling pathways. Next, we tested the effect of Hamp1 deletion, and low iron diets, on M.tb infection. Hamp1 knockout mice did not have a significantly altered M.tb mycobacterial load in either the lungs or spleen. Up to 10 weeks of dietary iron restriction did not robustly affect disease outcome despite causing iron deficiency anaemia. Taken together, our data indicate that unlike with many other infections, hepcidin is decreased following M.tb infection, and show that hepcidin ablation does not influence M.tb growth in vivo. Furthermore, because even severe iron deficiency did not affect M.tb mycobacterial load, we suggest that the mechanisms M.tb uses to scavenge iron from the host must be extremely efficient, and may therefore represent potential targets for drugs and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2783081750,"Exposure of mammalian cells to oxidative stress can result in DNA damage that adversely affects many cell processes. Lack of dependable DNA damage reference materials and standardized measurement methods, despite many case-control studies hampers the wider recognition of the link between oxidatively degraded DNA and disease risk. We used bulk electrolysis in an electrochemical system and gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis (GC/MS/MS) to control and measure, respectively, the effect of electrochemically produced reactive oxygen species on calf thymus DNA (ct-DNA). DNA was electro-oxidized for 1 h at four fixed oxidizing potentials (E = 0.5 V, 1.0 V, 1.5 V and 2 V (vs Ag/AgCl)) using a high surface area boron-doped diamond (BDD) working electrode (WE) and the resulting DNA damage in the form of oxidatively-modified DNA lesions was measured using GC/MS/MS. We have shown that there are two distinct base lesion formation modes in the explored electrode potential range, corresponding to 0.5 V < E < 1.5 V and E > 1.5 V. Amounts of all four purine lesions were close to a negative control levels up to E = 1.5 V with evidence suggesting higher levels at the lowest potential of this range (E = 0.5 V). A rapid increase in all base lesion yields was measured when ct-DNA was exposed at E = 2 V, the potential at which hydroxyl radicals were efficiently produced by the BDD electrode. The present results demonstrate that controlled potential preparative electrooxidation of double-stranded DNA can be used to purposely increase the levels of oxidatively modified DNA lesions in discrete samples. It is envisioned that these DNA samples may potentially serve as analytical control or quality assurance reference materials for the determination of oxidatively induced DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2783003321,"Island Rule postulated that individuals on islands tend to dwarfism when individuals from mainland populations are large and to gigantism when mainland populations present small individuals. There has been much discussion about this rule, but only few studies were carried out aiming to reveal this pattern for anurans. Our study focused on measuring the size of individuals on islands and to find a possible pattern of size modification for insular anurans. Individuals were collected on continental islands, measured and compared to mainland populations. We selected four species with different natural history aspects during these analyses. Island parameters were compared to size of individuals in order to find an explanation to size modification. Three of the four species presented size shifting on islands. Ololygon trapicheiroi and Adenomera marmorata showed dwarfism, Boana albomarginata showed gigantism and in Thoropa miliaris there was no evident size modification. Allometric analysis also revealed differential modification, which might be a result of different selective pressures on islands in respect of mainland populations. Regression model explained most of the size modification in B. albomarginata, but not for the other species. Our results indicate that previous assumptions, usually proposed for mammals from older islands, do not fit to the anurans studied here. We support the assumption that size modification on islands are population-specific. Hence, in B. albomarginata some factor associated to competition, living area and isolation time might likely be responsible for gigantism on islands."
https://openalex.org/W2783771237,"Swine dysentery (SD) is an economically important diarrheal disease in pigs caused by different strongly hemolytic Brachyspira (B.) species, such as B. hyodysenteriae, B. suanatina and B. hampsonii. Possible associations of epidemiologic data, such as multilocus sequence types (STs) to virulence gene profiles and antimicrobial susceptibility are rather scarce, particularly for B. hyodysenteriae isolates from Germany. In this study, B. hyodysenteriae (n = 116) isolated from diarrheic pigs between 1990 and 2016 in Germany were investigated for their STs, susceptibility to the major drugs used for treatment of SD (tiamulin and valnemulin) and genes that were previously linked with virulence and encode for hemolysins (tlyA, tlyB, tlyC, hlyA, BHWA1_RS02885, BHWA1_RS09085, BHWA1_RS04705, and BHWA1_RS02195), outer membrane proteins (OMPs) (bhlp16, bhlp17.6, bhlp29.7, bhmp39f, and bhmp39h) as well as iron acquisition factors (ftnA and bitC). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that 79.4% of the isolates belonged to only three STs, namely ST52 (41.4%), ST8 (12.1%), and ST112 (25.9%) which have been observed in other European countries before. Another 24 isolates belonged to twelve new STs (ST113-118, ST120-123, ST131, and ST193). The temporal distribution of STs revealed the presence of new STs as well as the regular presence of ST52 over three decades (1990s–2000s). The proportion of strains that showed resistance to both tiamulin und valnemulin (39.1%) varied considerably among the most frequent STs ranging from 0% (0/14 isolates resistant) in ST8 isolates to 46.7% (14/30), 52.1% (25/48), and 85.7% (6/7) in isolates belonging to ST112, ST52, and ST114, respectively. All hemolysin genes as well as the iron-related gene ftnA and the OMP gene bhlp29.7 were regularly present in the isolates, while the OMP genes bhlp17.6 and bhmp39h could not be detected. Sequence analysis of hemolysin genes of selected isolates revealed co-evolution of tlyB, BHWA1_RS02885, BHWA1_RS09085, and BHWA1_RS02195 with the core genome and suggested independent evolution of tlyA, tlyC, and hlyA. Our data indicate that in Germany, swine dysentery might be caused by a limited number of B. hyodysenteriae clonal groups. Major STs (ST8, ST52, and ST112) are shared with other countries in Europe suggesting a possible role of the European intra-Community trade of pigs in the dissemination of certain clones. The identification of several novel STs, some of which are single or double locus variants of ST52, may on the other hand hint towards an ongoing diversification of the pathogen in the studied area. The linkage of pleuromutilin susceptibility and sequence type of an isolate might reflect a clonal expansion of the underlying resistance mechanism, namely mutations in the ribosomal RNA genes. A linkage between single virulence-associated genes (VAGs) or even VAG patterns and the phylogenetic background of the isolates could not be established, since almost all VAGs were regularly present in the isolates."

Appropriate and effective health promotion methods used by professional groups remain to be investigated. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a weight management program among the Chinese occupational population using and a novel information technology exercise prescription. Study design and participants A 3-month open, self-monitored intervention trial, involving individualized pedometer-assisted exercise prescription and a one-time targeted dietary guidance prior to exercise was conducted on the Chinese occupational population aged 18–65 years in China from 2015 to 2016. Data were collected from March 2015 to May 2016 and analyzed from June 2016 to August 2016. Participants were also asked to synchronize exercise data of the pedometer to the Internet-based Health System Center daily (at least weekly), by connecting to the personal computer (PC) using a USB cable or via Bluetooth. Results Eligible participants included 802 Chinese occupational persons, and 718 of them followed exercise interventions with 89.5% (718/802) adherence to the exercise programs. Of them, 688 participants completed the program with 85.8% (688/802) adherence to the exercise program and their data were analyzed. Weight decreased by 2.2% among all overweight/obese participants, with 1.8% reduction in waist circumference and 3.3% reduction in body fat percentage (p< 0.001). Weight and body fat percentage in normal-weight individuals decreased by 0.7% and 2.5%, respectively (p < 0.01). A weight gain of 1.0% was observed in all underweight participants (p< 0.05), and 68.2% (208/305) of overweight/obese participants experienced weight loss, with an average reduction of 3.5%, with 20.2% (42/208) of them achieving weight loss ≥5%. Blood pressure and fasting serum glucose decreased significantly in both the overweight/obese and the normal-weight individuals (p < 0.05). The incidence of hypertension was significantly lower and lifestyle behavior significantly improved (p < 0.05). Conclusion The prescription pedometer-assisted walking intervention can effectively improve exercise adherence and manage weight. This approach was also effective in controlling the risk factors of weight-related chronic diseases. Trial registration Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) ChiCTR-OOh-16010229"
https://openalex.org/W2784160109,"Compound K (C-K) is a crucial pharmaceutical and cosmetic component because of disease prevention and skin anti-aging effects. For industrial application of this active compound, the protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides should be transformed to C-K. β-Glycosidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus has been reported as an efficient C-K-producing enzyme, using glycosylated PPD-type ginsenosides as substrates. β-Glycosidase from S. solfataricus can hydrolyze β-d-glucopyranoside in ginsenosides Rc, C-Mc1, and C-Mc, but not α-l-arabinofuranoside in these ginsenosides. To determine candidate residues involved in α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity, compound Mc (C-Mc) was docking to β-glycosidase from S. solfataricus in homology model and sequence was aligned with β-glycosidase from Pyrococcus furiosus that has α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity. A L213A variant β-glycosidase with increased α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity was selected by substitution of other amino acids for candidate residues. The increased α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity of the L213A variant was confirmed through the determination of substrate specificity, change in binding energy, transformation pathway, and C-K production from ginsenosides Rc and C-Mc. The L213A variant β-glycosidase catalyzed the conversion of Rc to Rd by hydrolyzing α-l-arabinofuranoside linked to Rc, whereas the wild-type β-glycosidase did not. The variant enzyme converted ginsenosides Rc and C-Mc into C-K with molar conversions of 97%, which were 1.5- and 2-fold higher, respectively, than those of the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, protein engineering is a useful tool for enhancing the hydrolytic activity on specific glycoside linked to ginsenosides."
https://openalex.org/W2784279194,"Survival during the settlement window is a limiting variable for recruitment. The survival is believed to be strongly determined by biological interactions and sea conditions, however it has been poorly investigated. We examined the settlement patterns related to relevant biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. Density-dependence, wind stress, wave height and coastal current velocity) potentially determining post-settler survival rates of a coastal necto-benthic fish of wide distribution in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, the white seabream (Diplodus sargus). An observational study of the demography of juveniles of this species was carried out at six coves in Menorca Island (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean). Three of the coves were located in the northern and wind exposed coast, at the Northeast (NE) side; while the other three were found along the southern and sheltered coast, at the Southwest (SW) side of the island. The settlement period extended from early May to late June and maximum juvenile densities at the sampling sites varied between 5 and 11 ind. m-1 with maximum values observed in late May simultaneously occurring in the two coasts. Our analysis of juvenile survival, based on the interpretation of the observed patters using an individual based model (IBM), revealed two stages in the size-mortality relationships. An initial density-dependent stage was observed for juveniles up to 20 mm TL, followed by a density independent stage when other factors dominated the survival at sizes > 20 mm TL. No significant environmental effects were observed for the small size class (<20mm TL). Different significant environmental effects affecting NE and SW coves were observed for the medium (20-30mm TL) and large (>30mm TL) size class. In the NE, the wind stress consistently affected the density of fish of 20–30 mm and >30 mm TL with a dome-shape effect with higher densities at intermediate values of wind stress and negative effect at the extremes. The best models applied in the SW coves showed a significant non-linear negative effect on fish density that was also consistent for both groups 20–30 mm and >30 mm TL. Higher densities were observed at low values of wave height in the two groups. Because of these variations, the number of juveniles present at the end of the period was unrelated to their initial density and average survival varied among locations. In consequence, recruitment was (1) primarily limited by denso-dependient procedures at settlement stage, and (2) by sea conditions at post-settlement, where extreme wave conditions depleted juveniles. Accordingly, regional hydrodynamic conditions during the settlement season produced significant impacts on the juvenile densities depending on their size and with contrasted effects in respectto cove orientation. The similar strength in larval supply between coves, in addition to the similar mean phenology for settlers in the north and south of the Island, suggests that all fish may come from the same parental reproductive pool. These factors should be taken into account when assessing relationships between settlers, recruits and adults of white seabream."
https://openalex.org/W2783304682,"We carried out geochemical analyses on a sediment core from Lake Harris, Florida (USA) to identify sources of organic matter to the sediment throughout the Holocene, and relate changes in those sources to shifts in past climate and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that the sources of organic matter changed in response to regional hydrologic shifts following de-glaciation, and to human population expansion in the state during the 20th century. Hydroclimate shifts in Florida were related to: 1) a steady rise in relative sea level and the fresh water table that began in the early Holocene, 2) wetland formation and expansion ca. 5,000 cal yrs BP, and 3) the onset of the modern El Niño (ENSO) cycle ~3,000 cal yrs BP. Stratigraphic changes in sediment variables from Lake Harris reflect each of these hydroclimate periods. Early in the Holocene, Lake Harris was a marsh-like system in a relatively dry, open-prairie environment. Organic sediments deposited at that time were derived largely from terrestrial sources, as inferred from high TOC/TN ratios, a dominance of longer-chain of n-alkanes (n-C29-31), relatively negative organic carbon isotope values (δ13CTOC), and low biogenic silica concentrations. In the middle Holocene, a positive shift in δ13CTOC coincided with the onset of wetter conditions in Florida. Submerged macrophyte biomarkers (n-C21-23) dominated, and during that period bulk organic carbon isotope values were most similar to δ13C values of mid-chain-length n-alkanes. In the late Holocene, δ13CTOC values declined, CaCO3 levels decreased to trace amounts, organic carbon concentrations increased and diatom biogenic silica concentrations increased from 10 to 120 mg g-1. Around 2,900 cal yrs BP, the effects of ENSO intensified and many Florida lakes deepened to their current limnetic state. Concentrations of algal and cyanobacterial biomarkers in the Lake Harris core increased by orders of magnitude after about AD 1940, in response to human-induced eutrophication, an inference supported by values of δ15N that fluctuate around zero."

The relationships between its 11 genera, as well as between Lychnophorinae and other subtribes belonging to the tribe Vernonieae, have recently been investigated upon a phylogeny based on molecular and morphological data. We report the use of a comprehensive untargeted metabolomics approach, combining HPLC-MS and GC-MS data, followed by multivariate analyses aiming to assess the congruence between metabolomics data and the phylogenetic hypothesis, as well as its potential as a chemotaxonomic tool. We analyzed 78 species by UHPLC-MS and GC-MS in both positive and negative ionization modes. The metabolic profiles obtained for these species were treated in MetAlign and in MSClust and the matrices generated were used in SIMCA for hierarchical cluster analyses, principal component analyses and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis. The results showed that metabolomic analyses are mostly congruent with the phylogenetic hypothesis especially at lower taxonomic levels (Lychnophora or Eremanthus). Our results confirm that data generated using metabolomics provide evidence for chemotaxonomical studies, especially for phylogenetic inference of the Lychnophorinae subtribe and insight into the evolution of the secondary metabolites of this group."
https://openalex.org/W2783589006,"Amino acid substitutions within or near the active site of the viral neuraminidase (NA) may affect influenza virus fitness. In influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses circulating in Thailand between 2010 and 2015, we identified several NA substitutions that were previously reported to be associated with reduced inhibition by NA inhibitors (NAIs). To study the effect of these substitutions on the enzymatic properties of NA and on virus characteristics, we generated recombinant influenza viruses possessing either a wild type (WT) NA or an NA with a single I222V, S331G, or S331R substitution [in influenza A(H3N2) viruses] or a single D342S, A395T, A395V, or A395D NA substitution (in influenza B viruses). We generated recombinant (7:1) influenza A and B viruses on the genetic background of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (A/PR/8, H1N1) or B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (B/YAM) viruses, respectively. In contrast to the expected phenotypes, all the recombinant influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses carrying putative NA resistance substitutions were susceptible to NAIs. The Km and Vmax for the NAs of A/PR8-S331G and A/PR8-S331R viruses were higher than for the NA of WT virus, and the corresponding values for the B/YAM-D342S virus were lower than for the NA of WT virus. Although there was initial variation in the kinetics of influenza A and B viruses’ replication in MDCK cells, their titers were comparable to each other and to WT viruses at later time points. All introduced substitutions were stable except for B/YAM-D342S and B/YAM-A395V which reverted to WT sequences after three passages. Our data suggest that inferring susceptibility to NAIs based on sequence information alone should be cautioned. The impact of NA substitution on NAI resistance, viral growth, and enzymatic properties is viral context dependent and should be empirically determined."
https://openalex.org/W2783604070,"SP-D, YKL-40, CCL18 and CA 15-3 are pulmonary markers that have been extensively investigated in different chronic pulmonary diseases. However, in acute pulmonary diseases, such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), little is known about the course of these markers and their relationship with the aetiological agent. The aim of this study was to investigate the course of these four markers in CAP and to study influence of disease severity, aetiology and antibiotic use prior to admission on their course.We included 291 adult patients hospitalised with CAP and 20 healthy controls. Measurements were performed in serum of day 0, 2, and 4, and at least 30 days after admission.Our most important results were: 1) At all time-points, including 30 days after admission, YKL-40 and CCL18 levels were higher in CAP patients compared to healthy controls; and 2) Patients with CAP caused by an intracellular, atypical bacterium had lower YKL-40 and especially CCL18 levels on and during admission in comparison with other or unknown CAP aetiology.Our findings suggest that these pulmonary markers could be useful to assess CAP severity and, especially YKL-40 and CCL18 by helping predict CAP caused by atypical pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2782717555,"Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, common zoonosis among vertebrates and high incidence worldwide. During the infection, the parasite needs to transpose the intestinal barrier to spread throughout the body, which may be a trigger for an inflammatory reaction. This work evaluated the inflammatory alterations of early T. gondii infection in peripheral blood cells, in the mesenteric microcirculation, and small intestinal tissue by measurement of MPO (myeloperoxidase) activity and NO (nitric oxide) level in rats. Animals were randomly assigned into control group (CG) that received saline orally and groups infected with 5,000 oocysts for 6 (G6), 12 (G12), 24 (G24), 48 (G48) and 72 hours (G72). Blood samples were collected for total and differential leukocyte count. Intravital microscopy was performed in the mesentery to evaluate rolling and adhesion of leukocytes. After euthanasia, 0.5cm of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum were collected for the determination of MPO activity, NO level and PCR to identify the parasite DNA and also the mesentery were collected to perform immunohistochemistry on frozen sections to quantify adhesion molecules ICAM-1, PECAM-1 and P-Selectin. The parasite DNA was identified in all infected groups and there was an increase in leukocytes in the peripheral blood and in expression of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 in G6 and G12, however, the expression of P-selectin was reduced in G12. Leukocytes are in rolling process during the first 12 hours and they are adhered at 24 hours post-infection. The activity of MPO increased in the duodenum at 12 hours, and NO increased in the jejunum in G72 and ileum in G24, G48 and G72. Our study demonstrated that T. gondii initiates the infection precociously (at 6 hours) leading to a systemic activation of innate immune response resulting in mild inflammation in a less susceptible experimental model."
https://openalex.org/W2783559756,"Introduction TP53 mutation carrier (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, LFS) cohort studies often suffer from lack of extensive pedigree exploration. Methods We performed a nation-wide exploration of TP53 mutation carrier families identified through all clinical genetics departments in Denmark. Pedigrees were expanded and verified using unique national person identification, cancer, cause of death, pathology, and church registries. Results We identified 30 confirmed, six obligate and 14 assumed carriers in 15 families harboring 14 different mutations, including five novel and three de novo germline mutations. All but two (96%) developed cancer by age 54 years [mean debut age; 29.1 y., median 33.0 y., n = 26 (17F, 9M), range 1–54 y]]. Cancer was the primary cause of all deaths [average age at death; 34.5 years]. Two tumors were identified through registry data alone. Two independent families harbored novel c.80delC mutations shown to be related through an ancestor born in 1907. This exhaustive national collection yielded markedly fewer TP53 mutation carriers than the 300–1,100 expected based on estimated background population frequencies. Conclusion Germline TP53 mutations in Denmark are likely to be drastically underdiagnosed despite their severe phenotype. Following recent advances in surveillance options of LFS patients, lack of pre-symptomatic testing may lead to the mismanagement of some individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2783829499,"Values are central to public debates today. Human values convey broad goals that serve as guiding principles in a person’s life and value priorities differ across people in society. Groups in society holding opposing values (e.g., universalism versus security) will make different choices when voting in an election. Whereas over time, values are relatively stable, the number and type of political parties as well as the political values they communicate and disseminate have been changing. Groups of people holding the same human values may therefore vote for another (new) party in a later election. We focus on analyzing the relationship between human values and voting in elections, introducing a new methodology to analyze how value profiles relate to political support over time. We investigate the Dutch multi-party political system over five waves of the European Social Survey, spanning 2002 until 2010. Whilst previous research has focused on individual values separately and focused on voters only, we (1) distinguish groups holding a similar set of opposing and compatible values (value profile) instead of focusing on single values in the the entire population; (2) incorporate a correction for differences in scale use in our model; (3) compare voting over time; (4) include non-voters, a growing group in Dutch society. We find evidence that specific value profiles are related to voting for a specific set of political parties. We also find that specific value profiles distinguish non-voters from voters and that voters for populist parties resemble non-voters."
https://openalex.org/W2782692514,"ESRP1 regulates alternative splicing, producing multiple transcripts from its target genes in epithelial tissues. It is upregulated during mesenchymal to epithelial transition associated with reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPS cells and has been linked to pluripotency. Mouse fetal germ cells are the founders of the adult gonadal lineages and we found that Esrp1 mRNA was expressed in both male and female germ cells but not in gonadal somatic cells at various stages of gonadal development (E12.5-E15.5). In the postnatal testis, Esrp1 mRNA was highly expressed in isolated cell preparations enriched for spermatogonia but expressed at lower levels in those enriched for pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. Co-labelling experiments with PLZF and c-KIT showed that ESRP1 was localized to nuclei of both Type A and B spermatogonia in a speckled pattern, but was not detected in SOX9+ somatic Sertoli cells. No co-localization with the nuclear speckle marker, SC35, which has been associated with post-transcriptional splicing, was observed, suggesting that ESRP1 may be associated with co-transcriptional splicing or have other functions. RNA interference mediated knockdown of Esrp1 expression in the seminoma-derived Tcam-2 cell line demonstrated that ESRP1 regulates alternative splicing of mRNAs in a non-epithelial cell germ cell tumour cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2783047262,"Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) protein in neurodevelopment and chronic mental illness. In particular, the C-terminal 300 amino acids of DISC1 have been found to mediate important protein-protein interactions and to harbor functionally important phosphorylation sites and disease-associated polymorphisms. However, long disordered regions and oligomer-forming subdomains have so far impeded structural analysis. VHH domains derived from camelid heavy chain only antibodies are minimal antigen binding modules with appreciable solubility and stability, which makes them well suited for the stabilizing proteins prior to structural investigation. Here, we report on the generation of a VHH domain derived from an immunized Lama glama, displaying high affinity for the human DISC1 C region (aa 691–836), and its characterization by surface plasmon resonance, size exclusion chromatography and immunological techniques. The VHH-DISC1 (C region) complex was also used for structural investigation by small angle X-ray scattering analysis. In combination with molecular modeling, these data support predictions regarding the three-dimensional fold of this DISC1 segment as well as its steric arrangement in complex with our VHH antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2783852609,"Little is known about phylogeography of armadillo species native to southern South America. In this study we describe the phylogeography of the screaming hairy armadillo Chaetophractus vellerosus, discuss previous hypothesis about the origin of its disjunct distribution and propose an alternative one, based on novel information on genetic variability. Variation of partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA Control Region (CR) from 73 individuals from 23 localities were analyzed to carry out a phylogeographic analysis using neutrality tests, mismatch distribution, median-joining (MJ) network and paleontological records. We found 17 polymorphic sites resulting in 15 haplotypes. Two new geographic records that expand known distribution of the species are presented; one of them links the distributions of recently synonimized species C. nationi and C. vellerosus. Screaming hairy armadillo phylogeographic pattern can be addressed as category V of Avise: common widespread linages plus closely related lineages confined to one or a few nearby locales each. The older linages are distributed in the north-central area of the species distribution range in Argentina (i.e. ancestral area of distribution). C. vellerosus seems to be a low vagility species that expanded, and probably is expanding, its distribution range while presents signs of genetic structuring in central areas. To explain the disjunct distribution, a hypothesis of extinction of the species in intermediate areas due to quaternary climatic shift to more humid conditions was proposed. We offer an alternative explanation: long distance colonization, based on null genetic variability, paleontological record and evidence of alternance of cold/arid and temperate/humid climatic periods during the last million years in southern South America."
https://openalex.org/W2783946826,"Background The role of migration in the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is well-documented. Yet migration and HIV research have often focused on HIV risks to male migrants and their partners, or migrants overall, often failing to measure the risks to women via their direct involvement in migration. Inconsistent measures of mobility, gender biases in those measures, and limited data sources for sex-specific population-based estimates of mobility have contributed to a paucity of research on the HIV prevention and care needs of migrant and highly mobile women. This study addresses an urgent need for novel methods for developing probability-based, systematic samples of highly mobile women, focusing on a population of female traders operating out of one of the largest open air markets in East Africa. Our method involves three stages: 1.) identification and mapping of all market stall locations using Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates; 2.) using female market vendor stall GPS coordinates to build the sampling frame using replicates; and 3.) using maps and GPS data for recruitment of study participants. Results The location of 6,390 vendor stalls were mapped using GPS. Of these, 4,064 stalls occupied by women (63.6%) were used to draw four replicates of 128 stalls each, and a fifth replicate of 15 pre-selected random alternates for a total of 527 stalls assigned to one of five replicates. Staff visited 323 stalls from the first three replicates and from these successfully recruited 306 female vendors into the study for a participation rate of 94.7%. Mobilization strategies and involving traders association representatives in participant recruitment were critical to the study’s success. Conclusion The study’s high participation rate suggests that this geospatial sampling method holds promise for development of probability-based samples in other settings that serve as transport hubs for highly mobile populations."
https://openalex.org/W2783479292,"A number of programs have been developed to promote the contact between adolescents and mentally-ill patients, in order to break the stigma, improve understanding, promote mental health and prevent substance abuse. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of patients with schizophrenia, high school students, and their social context, participating in a short-term cohousing initiative.A qualitative case-study approach was implemented. Patients with schizophrenia from the San Juan de Dios Psychiatric Hospital, female students from Almen High School, and participants from their social context (parents, hospital staff, and teachers) were included, using purposeful sampling. Data were collected from 51 participants (15 patients, nine students, 11 hospital staff, six teachers, 10 parents) via non-participant observation, focus groups, informal interviews, researchers' field notes and patients' personal diaries and letters. A thematic analysis was performed.The themes identified included a) learning to live together: students and patients participate and learn together; b) the perception of the illness and the mentally-ill: the barrier between health and disease is very slim, and society tends to avoid contact with those who are ill; c) change: a transformation takes place in students, in their self-perception, based on the real and intense nature of the experience; d) a trial and an opportunity: patients test their ability to live outside the hospital; e) discharge and readmission: discharge is experienced as both a liberation and a difficulty, whereas relapse and readmission are experienced as failures.Our findings can help us to better understand schizophrenia and encourage a more positive approach towards both the illness and those who suffer from it. These results may be used for the development of cohousing programs in controlled environments."
https://openalex.org/W2783412333,"Cerebral extraction of diffusively distributed substances like oxygen has been suggested to change according to the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and status of the microvasculature. The relationships between the cerebral extraction of diffusively distributed lipophilic tracers and the severity of cerebral ischemia has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the association between the extraction fraction of the lipophilic tracer I-123 iomazenil (IMZ) (IMZ-EF) and the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) derived from O-15 PET in patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease of internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA).Seven patients with unilateral chronic severe stenosis or occlusion of the middle cerebral/internal cerebral artery were prospectively recruited for this study. All the patients underwent both O-15 PET and quantitative I-123 IMZ SPECT. Parametric images derived from the PET and SPECT scans were anatomically normalized and evaluated by automated image analysis based on the volume-of-interest template.The asymmetry index (AI) of IMZ-EF was shown to be significantly correlated with the AI of OEF (r = 0.562, P < 0.001) in the internal carotid artery perfusion area. Strong and significant correlation between the AI of the influx rate constant K1 of IMZ and the AI of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (r = 0.552, P = 0.001) was clarified.Our results suggested that the transportation efficiency of I-123 IMZ into the brain tissue was an indicator for evaluating severity of cerebral ischemia in patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease of ICA or MCA. Cerebral metabolic state can possibly be estimated by I-123 IMZ SPECT without cyclotron."
https://openalex.org/W2782625736,"Sensors able to record large bowel physiology and biochemistry in situ in awake rodents are lacking. Microdialysis is a mini-invasive technique that may be utilized to continuously deliver or recover low-molecular substances from various tissues. In this experiment we evaluated the feasibility of in vivo microdialysis to monitor extracellular fluid chemistry in the descending colon submucosa of conscious, freely moving rodents. Following surgical implantation of a microdialysis probe, male Wistar rats were housed in metabolic cages where they were analgized and clinically followed for four days with free access to standard diet and water. To assess local microcirculation and probe function, glucose, lactate, glucose-to-lactate ratio and urea clearance were determined in the dialysates from the three postoperative days with focus on the final 24-h period. In an attempt to mitigate the expected tissue inflammatory response, one group of animals had the catheters perfused with 5-aminosalicylic acid-enriched medium with final concentration 1 μmol/L. For verification of probe position and the assessment of the surrounding foreign body reaction, standard histological and immunohistochemical methods were employed. Microdialysis of rat gut is associated with considerable technical challenges that may lead to the loss of probe function and high drop-out rate. In this setting, limited data did not allow to draw any firm conclusion regarding local anti-inflammatory effectiveness of 5-aminosalicylic acid perfusion. Although intestinal microdialysis may be suitable for larger anesthetized animals, low reproducibility of the presented method compromises its routine experimental use in awake and freely moving small-sized rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2783451310,"Recent research in infant cognition and adult vision suggests that the mechanical object relationships may be more salient and naturally attention grabbing than similar but non-mechanical relationships. Here we examine two novel sources of evidence from language related to this hypothesis. In Experiments 1 and 2, we show that adults preferentially infer that the meaning of a novel preposition refers to a mechanical as opposed to a non-mechanical relationship. Experiments 3 and 4 examine cross-linguistic adpositions obtained on a large scale from machines or from experts, respectively. While these methods differ in the ease of data collection relative to the reliability of the data, their results converge: we find that across a range of diverse and historically unrelated languages, adpositions (such as prepositions) referring to the mechanical relationships of containment (e.g ""in"") and support (e.g. ""on"") are systematically shorter than closely matched but not mechanical words such as ""behind,"" ""beside,"" ""above,"" ""over,"" ""out,"" and ""off."" These results first suggest that languages regularly contain traces of core knowledge representations and that cross-linguistic regularities can therefore be a useful and easily accessible form of information that bears on the foundations of non-linguistic thought."
