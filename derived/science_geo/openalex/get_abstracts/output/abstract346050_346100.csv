https://openalex.org/W1965097716,"The field of nanotechnology holds great promise for the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. However, the size and charge of most nanoparticles preclude their efficient clearance from the body as intact nanoparticles. Without such clearance or their biodegradation into biologically benign components, toxicity is potentially amplified and radiological imaging is hindered. Using intravenously administered quantum dots in rodents as a model system, we have precisely defined the requirements for renal filtration and urinary excretion of inorganic, metal-containing nanoparticles. Zwitterionic or neutral organic coatings prevented adsorption of serum proteins, which otherwise increased hydrodynamic diameter by >15 nm and prevented renal excretion. A final hydrodynamic diameter <5.5 nm resulted in rapid and efficient urinary excretion and elimination of quantum dots from the body. This study provides a foundation for the design and development of biologically targeted nanoparticles for biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2141595533,"Coordination of cell proliferation and cell death is essential to attain proper organ size during development and for maintaining tissue homeostasis throughout postnatal life. In Drosophila, these two processes are orchestrated by the Hippo kinase cascade, a growth-suppressive pathway that ultimately antagonizes the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Here we demonstrate that a single phosphorylation site in Yki mediates the growth-suppressive output of the Hippo pathway. Hippo-mediated phosphorylation inactivates Yki by excluding it from the nucleus, whereas loss of Hippo signaling leads to nuclear accumulation and therefore increased Yki activity. We further delineate a mammalian Hippo signaling pathway that culminates in the phosphorylation of YAP, the mammalian homolog of Yki. Using a conditional YAP transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the mammalian Hippo pathway is a potent regulator of organ size, and that its dysregulation leads to tumorigenesis. These results uncover a universal size-control mechanism in metazoan."
https://openalex.org/W2110768898,"TLR2 in association with TLR1 or TLR6 plays an important role in the innate immune response by recognizing microbial lipoproteins and lipopeptides. Here we present the crystal structures of the human TLR1-TLR2-lipopeptide complex and of the mouse TLR2-lipopeptide complex. Binding of the tri-acylated lipopeptide, Pam3CSK4, induced the formation of an “m” shaped heterodimer of the TLR1 and TLR2 ectodomains whereas binding of the di-acylated lipopeptide, Pam2CSK4, did not. The three lipid chains of Pam3CSK4 mediate the heterodimerization of the receptor; the two ester-bound lipid chains are inserted into a pocket in TLR2, while the amide-bound lipid chain is inserted into a hydrophobic channel in TLR1. An extensive hydrogen-bonding network, as well as hydrophobic interactions, between TLR1 and TLR2 further stabilize the heterodimer. We propose that formation of the TLR1-TLR2 heterodimer brings the intracellular TIR domains close to each other to promote dimerization and initiate signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1992913613,"A major cause of cell death caused by genotoxic stress is thought to be due to the depletion of NAD+ from the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we show that NAD+ levels in mitochondria remain at physiological levels following genotoxic stress and can maintain cell viability even when nuclear and cytoplasmic pools of NAD+ are depleted. Rodents fasted for 48 hr show increased levels of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme Nampt and a concomitant increase in mitochondrial NAD+. Increased Nampt provides protection against cell death and requires an intact mitochondrial NAD+ salvage pathway as well as the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylases SIRT3 and SIRT4. We discuss the relevance of these findings to understanding how nutrition modulates physiology and to the evolution of apoptosis.

We discuss the relevance of these findings to understanding how nutrition modulates physiology and to the evolution of apoptosis. Approximately 2 billion years ago, eukaryotes evolved by subsuming a bacterial antecedent of modern mitochondria (Barile et al., 1996Barile M. Cozzani E. Anonide A. Usiglio D. Burroni A. Guarrera M.

Mitochondrial evolution.Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Mitochondria still retain a variety of molecules that dictate cell survival, which at one time may have been important for the survival of the bacterial proto-mitochondrion (James et al., 1998James S.J. Muskhelishvili L. Gaylor D.W. Turturro A. Hart R. Upregulation of apoptosis with dietary restriction: implications for carcinogenesis and aging.Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Elucidation of these cell survival pathways is considered key to the development of new approaches to treating a variety of human diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration (Porcu and Chiarugi, 2005Porcu M.

One of the major causes of cell death due to genotoxic stress is hyperactivation of the NAD+-dependent enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which depletes nuclear and cytoplasmic NAD+ causing the translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial membrane to the nucleus (Burkle, 2005Burkle A.

One recent study reported that a fraction of PARP-1 is localized in mitochondria, which has led to speculation about the potential for mitochondrial NAD+ to determine cell fate (Du et al., 2003Du L.

The sirtuins are a conserved family of deacetylases and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases that use NAD+ as a co-substrate (Guarente and Picard, 2005Guarente L. Picard F.

The founding member of the sirtuin family, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2, is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that mediates life span extension by mild stress and calorie restriction (CR) (Imai et al., 2000Imai S.

Mammals have seven sirtuins, SIRT1–7. SIRT1, a nuclear deacetylase, regulates a variety of functions including cell survival, glucose homeostasis, and fat metabolism (Guarente, 2005Guarente L. Calorie restriction and SIR2 genes–towards a mechanism.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). There are three mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3–5. SIRT3 and SIRT4 were recently shown to regulate acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (AceCS2) and glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively (Haigis et al., 2006Haigis M.C. Mostoslavsky R. Haigis K.M. Fahie K.

Howitz K. Helfand S.L. Tatar M. Sinclair D. Sirtuin activators mimic caloric restriction and delay ageing in metazoans.Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). Yeast Sir2 is positively regulated by PNC1, a stress- and calorie-responsive longevity gene that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in NAD+ biosynthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) (Anderson et al., 2003Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A.

Whether or not mammals possess a functional equivalent of the PNC1 gene is not known. Clearly, finding a mammalian equivalent of a gene that governs sirtuin activity and promotes longevity has many potential implications, including our understanding of how CR extends life span in mammals. The search for a mammalian equivalent of PNC1 has been complicated by the fact that the synthesis of NAD+ from NAM is different in mammals than in simple eukaryotes (Brenner, 2005Brenner C. Evolution of NAD biosynthetic enzymes.Structure. 2005; 13: 1239-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). While yeast, worms, and flies require four steps to synthesize NAD+ from NAM, mammals require only two (Rongvaux et al., 2002Rongvaux A. Shea R.J. Mulks M.H. Gigot D. Urbain J. Leo O. Andris F. Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor, whose expression is up-regulated in activated lymphocytes, is a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, a cytosolic enzyme involved in NAD biosynthesis.Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In yeast, the first step is catalyzed by Pnc1 and in mammals by the NAM phosphoribosyltransferase Nampt, also known as PBEF or visfatin (Fukuhara et al., 2004Fukuhara A. Matsuda M. Nishizawa M. Segawa K. Tanaka M. Kishimoto K. Matsuki Y. Murakami M. Ichisaka T.

Cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding a novel human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that overexpression of Nampt increases SIRT1 activity (Revollo et al., 2004Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S. The NAD biosynthesis pathway mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase regulates Sir2 activity in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) and can protect cells from death due to PARP overexpression (Pillai et al., 2005Pillai J.B. Isbatan A. Imai S. Gupta M.P. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-dependent cardiac myocyte cell death during heart failure is mediated by NAD+ depletion and reduced Sir2alpha deacetylase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43121-43130Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the hypothesis that Nampt is a functional equivalent of Pnc1 in mammals. In this paper, we identify NAMPT as a stress- and nutrient-responsive gene that boosts mitochondrial NAD+ levels. Mass spectrometric methods are used to accurately measure NAD+ concentrations within mammalian mitochondria and to show that NAMPT expression and mitochondrial NAD+ levels increase in vivo after fasting. Evidence is presented that increased mitochondrial NAD+ promotes cell survival during genotoxic stress and that protection is provided by the mitochondrial sirtuins SIRT3 and SIRT4. These data show that mitochondrial NAD+ is a major determinant of apoptosis and shed new light on the influence of diet on organ physiology and disease. Others and we have speculated that mammalian Nampt is the functional equivalent of yeast Pnc1 (Anderson et al., 2002Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S.

This idea was based on the fact that both Pnc1 and Nampt catalyze the first and rate-limiting step in NAD+ biosynthesis from NAM (Pillai et al., 2005Pillai J.B. Isbatan A. Imai S. Gupta M.P. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-dependent cardiac myocyte cell death during heart failure is mediated by NAD+ depletion and reduced Sir2alpha deacetylase activity.J. Biol.

Immunol. 2002; 32: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if NAMPT is analogous to the yeast PNC1 gene, then its expression might also be induced by cell stress and nutrient restriction. We found that human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells cultured in serum-free conditions had ∼1.5- to 2-fold the levels of Nampt relative to controls (Figure 1A). A similar increase in Nampt at both the mRNA and protein level was observed in the livers of rats that were subjected to a 48 hr fast (Figures 1B–1D). Primary cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia or serum-free media also had ∼2-fold higher levels of Nampt (Figure 1E). Similar results were observed in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) grown in serum-free medium (data not shown). Thus, NAMPT is a stress- and nutrient-responsive gene, similar in this regard to the yeast PNC1 gene. To mimic the upregulation of Nampt and to test what effect this has on stress resistance, we generated human Nampt-overexpressing stable cell lines from HT1080 fibrosarcoma and HEK293 embryonic kidney cells and selected lines that expressed 1.5 to 2 times the level of Nampt relative to vector controls (Figures 1F and 1H). A similar increase in Nampt expression was obtained by transiently transfecting HT1080 cells with a mouse Nampt expression construct (Figure 1G). Stable Nampt knockdown cell lines were also generated using siRNA (Figure 2A). Cell lines were then assayed for their sensitivity to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), a DNA alkylating agent that is known to hyperactivate PARP-1 (Horton et al., 2005Horton J.K. Stefanick D.F. Wilson S.H. Involvement of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity in regulating Chk1-dependent apoptotic cell death.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MMS treatment resulted in the death of about half the vector control cells, and the extent of cell death was greatly reduced by the PARP inhibitor, DPQ (Figure S1 available with this article online), indicating that PARP hyperactivation and depletion of NAD+ were the primary modes of death under these conditions. Although Nampt-overexpressing cells had only slightly higher levels of Nampt protein, they were substantially more resistant to MMS than controls (Figures 1F–1H). Conversely, cells with lower levels of Nampt were more sensitive to MMS (Figures 2A and Figure S2). A potent Nampt catalytic inhibitor, FK866, which binds in the active site (Drevs et al., 2003Drevs J. Loser R. Rattel B. Esser N. Antiangiogenic potency of FK866/K22.175, a new inhibitor of intracellular NAD biosynthesis, in murine renal cell carcinoma.Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 4853-4858PubMed Google Scholar), prevented cell protection by Nampt overexpression (Figure 2B), indicating that Nampt activity is required for cell protection. Given that Nampt levels increase in cells grown in serum-free media, we wondered whether cells in serum-free media are more resistant to MMS and, if so, whether their resistance is mediated by Nampt. As shown in Figure 2C, cells that were serum starved were more resistant to MMS, and this resistance was entirely Nampt dependent. We also tested whether Nampt provides resistance to cell death from other types of DNA damage. Etoposide is a cancer chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits topoisomerase II, resulting in numerous double-stranded DNA breaks that trigger apoptosis. Nampt-overexpressing cells were more resistant to etoposide and had reduced levels of cleaved caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis (Figure 2D). Conversely, cells with reduced levels of Nampt were more sensitive to etoposide and had increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 (Figure 2E). The Nampt knockdown cells were also more sensitive to camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor (Figure 2F), demonstrating that the ability of Nampt to protect from cell death is not specific to MMS. In light of a recent study showing that the ability of Nampt to protect against PARP-1 overexpression was SIRT1 mediated (Pillai et al., 2005Pillai J.B. Isbatan A. Imai S. Gupta M.P. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-dependent cardiac myocyte cell death during heart failure is mediated by NAD+ depletion and reduced Sir2alpha deacetylase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43121-43130Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), we expected that protection from MMS would be SIRT1 dependent. But neither EX-527, a SIRT1-specific inhibitor (Solomon et al., 2006Solomon J.M. Pasupuleti R. Xu L. McDonagh T. Curtis R. DiStefano P.S. Huber L.J. Inhibition of SIRT1 catalytic activity increases p53 acetylation but does not alter cell survival following DNA damage.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), nor siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT1 had a significant effect on Nampt-mediated survival (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). Curiously though, treatment of cells with the pan-sirtuin inhibitor, sirtinol, did block the ability of Nampt overexpression to protect cells (Figure 3C), which raised the possibility that survival might be mediated by another sirtuin. To test this idea, we knocked down each of the remaining sirtuins, SIRT2–7, using siRNA (Figures S3A–S3B) and scored survival after MMS treatment. Interestingly, the mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3 and SIRT4, but not the other sirtuins, were required for the ability of Nampt to protect against MMS-induced cell death (Figures 3D, 3E, and S3C–S3F). In addition, knockdown of SIRT3 sensitized wild-type (WT) cells to MMS and increased the relative abundance of cleaved caspase 3 (Figures 3D and 3F and data not shown). This effect appears to be relatively specific to MMS-induced cell death because there was no appreciable effect on sensitivity to etoposide (Figure S4). These data indicated that overexpression of Nampt might protect cells by increasing SIRT3 activity. We tested this by monitoring the acetylation status of AceCS2, a substrate of SIRT3. As shown in Figure 3G, Nampt overexpression markedly reduced the acetylation level of AceCS2, indicating that Nampt increases SIRT3 activity. Knockdown of SIRT4, on the other hand, had no significant effect on the survival of WT cells (Figure 3E and data not shown). There was no significant increase in the survival of cells overexpressing SIRT3 or SIRT4, or in combination (data not shown), suggesting that in the absence of additional Nampt, MMS causes NAD+ levels to drop below the concentration at which these NAD+-dependent enzymes can function, a possibility we tested below (see Figure 5). It is generally recognized that genotoxic stress kills cells by depleting nuclear and cytosolic NAD+ pools (Burkle, 2005Burkle A. Poly(ADP-ribose). The most elaborate metabolite of NAD+.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4576-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Porcu and Chiarugi, 2005Porcu M. Chiarugi A. The emerging therapeutic potential of sirtuin-interacting drugs: from cell death to lifespan extension.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 94-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To test whether Nampt protected against NAD+ depletion, we measured NAD+ concentrations in HEK293 cells after exposure to MMS using a quantitative HPLC/mass spectrometry method (HPLC/MALDI/MS) (Sauve et al., 2005Sauve A.A. Moir R.D. Schramm V.L. Willis I.M. Chemical activation of Sir2-dependent silencing by relief of nicotinamide inhibition.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We did not attempt to measure nicotinamide levels in mitochondria because, unlike NAD+, it diffuses through membranes (van Roermund et al., 1995van Roermund C.W. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. The membrane of peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is impermeable to NAD(H) and acetyl-CoA under in vivo conditions.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). An internal NAD+ reference, 18O-NAM, was synthesized from 3-cyanopyridine, then enzymatically converted to 18O-NAD+ using a recombinant NAD+ glycohydrolase, CD38 (Figure 4A). The key advantage of the HPLC/MALDI/MS technique is that extracts are spiked with an isotopically labeled NAD+ internal reference standard so that losses of NAD+ during purification do not affect the final result. After addition of the labeled standard, the NAD+ in the cell extracts was HPLC purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry, which gave two peaks that corresponded to the two isotopomer molecular ions (Figure 4B). The higher molecular weight species, 18O-NAD+, was used to determine the quantity of the lower weight endogenous species, 16O-NAD+. We estimate that the total NAD+ concentration in HEK293 cells is 365 ± 30.2 μM, which is very close to a recent estimate for mouse erythrocytes using HPLC/MS/electrospray ionization (368 μM) (Yamada et al., 2006Yamada K. Hara N. Shibata T. Osago H. Tsuchiya M. The simultaneous measurement of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and related compounds by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 352: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nampt-overexpressing cells had approximately twice the total NAD+ concentration of vector control cells and, conversely, Nampt knockdown cells had approximately half (Figures 4B and 4C). These data are consistent with other studies showing that Nampt catalyzes a rate-limiting step in nucleo-cytoplasmic NAD+ biosynthesis (Pillai et al., 2005Pillai J.B. Isbatan A. Imai S. Gupta M.P. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-dependent cardiac myocyte cell death during heart failure is mediated by NAD+ depletion and reduced Sir2alpha deacetylase activity.J. Biol.

The NAD biosynthesis pathway mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase regulates Sir2 activity in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Nampt overexpression did not appreciably affect MMS-mediated depletion of NAD+ in total cell extracts (Figure 4D). To ensure that we had not simply chosen an inappropriate time point, total NAD+ levels were measured at time points just prior to, and during which, cell protection by Nampt was observed (2 and 4 hr) (Figure 4E). Again, concentrations of total NAD+ became critically low (total [NAD+] < 100 μM), irrespective of Nampt levels (Figure 4F). These data raised an intriguing question: How does Nampt protect cells from genotoxic stress if not by maintaining total NAD+ levels? An important clue came from our observation that protection by Nampt required sirtuins that reside in mitochondria. The cell lines we were using, HT1080 and HEK293, possess relatively few mitochondria compared to highly metabolically active cells such as hepatocytes and myocytes (Di Lisa and Bernardi, 2006Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. Mitochondria and ischemia-reperfusion injury of the heart: fixing a hole.Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and hence mitochondria contribute only a minor component of the total NAD+ pool of these cells. It was plausible that the NAD+ remaining in the MMS-treated cells was primarily mitochondrial and that the increased survival in Nampt overexpressors was a consequence of increased NAD+ levels in mitochondria. Surprisingly little is known about the precise concentration of NAD+ in mammalian mitochondria or whether changes in mitochondrial NAD+ levels impact cell survival (Porcu and Chiarugi, 2005Porcu M.

https://openalex.org/W2161050915,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved 'self-eating' process. Although the genes essential for autophagy (named Atg) have been identified in yeast, the molecular mechanism of how Atg proteins control autophagosome formation in mammalian cells remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Bif-1 (also known as Endophilin B1) interacts with Beclin 1 through ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) and functions as a positive mediator of the class III PI(3) kinase (PI(3)KC3). In response to nutrient deprivation, Bif-1 localizes to autophagosomes where it colocalizes with Atg5, as well as microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Furthermore, loss of Bif-1 suppresses autophagosome formation. Although the SH3 domain of Bif-1 is sufficient for binding to UVRAG, both the BAR and SH3 domains are required for Bif-1 to activate PI(3)KC3 and induce autophagosome formation. We also observed that Bif-1 ablation prolongs cell survival under starvation conditions. Moreover, knockout of Bif-1 significantly enhances the development of spontaneous tumours in mice. These findings suggest that Bif-1 joins the UVRAG-Beclin 1 complex as a potential activator of autophagy and tumour suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2157360354,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is the master regulator of the heat shock response in eukaryotes, a very highly conserved protective mechanism. HSF1 function increases survival under a great many pathophysiological conditions. How it might be involved in malignancy remains largely unexplored. We report that eliminating HSF1 protects mice from tumors induced by mutations of the RAS oncogene or a hot spot mutation in the tumor suppressor p53. In cell culture, HSF1 supports malignant transformation by orchestrating a network of core cellular functions including proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, and glucose metabolism. The striking effects of HSF1 on oncogenic transformation are not limited to mouse systems or tumor initiation; human cancer lines of diverse origins show much greater dependence on HSF1 function to maintain proliferation and survival than their nontransformed counterparts. While it enhances organismal survival and longevity under most circumstances, HSF1 has the opposite effect in supporting the lethal phenomenon of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2152732341,"In plants, cell polarity and tissue patterning are connected by intercellular flow of the phytohormone auxin, whose directional signaling depends on polar subcellular localization of PIN auxin transport proteins. The mechanism of polar targeting of PINs or other cargos in plants is largely unidentified, with the PINOID kinase being the only known molecular component. Here, we identify PP2A phosphatase as an important regulator of PIN apical-basal targeting and auxin distribution. Genetic analysis, localization, and phosphorylation studies demonstrate that PP2A and PINOID both partially colocalize with PINs and act antagonistically on the phosphorylation state of their central hydrophilic loop, hence mediating PIN apical-basal polar targeting. Thus, in plants, polar sorting by the reversible phosphorylation of cargos allows for their conditional delivery to specific intracellular destinations. In the case of PIN proteins, this mechanism enables switches in the direction of intercellular auxin fluxes, which mediate differential growth, tissue patterning, and organogenesis.

In the case of PIN proteins, this mechanism enables switches in the direction of intercellular auxin fluxes, which mediate differential growth, tissue patterning, and organogenesis. Polarity is one of the elementary properties of eukaryotic cells and is inseparable from other fundamental processes such as division, differentiation, and cellular signaling. The intimate relation between cell polarity and patterning is particularly prominent in plants, since even fully differentiated cells often retain the potential to redefine their polarity, enabling crucial adaptation processes such as directional growth, tissue regeneration or de novo organ formation (Sauer et al., 2006aSauer M. Balla J. Luschnig C. Wiśniewska J. Reinöhl V. Friml J. Benková E.

The molecular mechanisms of polarized cargo traffic are conserved from yeast to humans and have been extensively characterized in animal epithelial cells, which exhibit a clearly discernible asymmetry between the apical and the basolateral plasma membrane domains (Mostov et al., 2003Mostov K.

Substantially less is known about the mechanism(s) of cell polarity establishment in plants. Much of our knowledge has been acquired by studying the asymmetric targeting of plant-specific plasma membrane-resident PIN proteins, which show distinct polar subcellular localizations.

PIN proteins facilitate the polar efflux of the plant growth regulator auxin from cells (Petrášek et al., 2006Petrášek J. Mravec J. Bouchard R. Blakeslee J.J. Abas M. Seifertova D. Wiśniewska J.

The rapid retargeting of PINs to different polar domains is possibly related to the constitutive endocytosis and recycling of PIN proteins (Dhonukshe et al., 2007Dhonukshe P. Aniento F. Hwang I.

Such flexible regulation of PIN polarity provides a way to integrate multiple signals at the level of single cells, translating them into intercellular auxin fluxes, relevant for diverse developmental processes (reviewed in Friml, 2003Friml J. Auxin transport—shaping the plant.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of PIN polarity control for plant development, the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. Genetic and pharmacological studies have indicated involvement of (de)phosphorylation processes in regulation of PIN-dependent auxin transport (Garbers et al., 1996Garbers Ch. DeLong A. Deruére J.

The protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase PINOID (Benjamins et al., 2001Benjamins R. Quint A. Weijers D. Hooykaas P. Offringa R.

Regulation of auxin response by the protein kinase PINOID.Cell. 2000; 100: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) is the only as yet identified molecular component directly involved in the regulation of polar delivery of PIN proteins. Loss of PINOID (PID) function causes an apical-to-basal shift in PIN polarity, correlating with defects in embryo and shoot organogenesis. On the other hand, PID gain-of-function results in an opposite basal-to-apical PIN polarity shift, which leads to auxin depletion from the root meristem, ultimately leading to its collapse (Friml et al., 2004Friml J. Yang X. Michniewicz M. Weijers D. Quint A. Tietz O. Benjamins R. Ouwerkerk P.B. Ljung K. Sandberg G. et al.A PINOID-dependent binary switch in apical-basal PIN polar targeting directs auxin efflux.Science. 2004; 306: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PID-dependent phosphorylation leads to preferentially apical PIN localization, whereas low phosphorylation levels result in basal PIN targeting. In such a scenario, reversible phosphorylation of components of the apical versus the basal targeting machinery could regulate their activities, which are decisive for polar targeting of membrane proteins. Alternatively, direct phosphorylation of cargo proteins, such as PINs, could determine their intracellular targeting. Here, we identify a phosphatase activity required for apical-basal PIN targeting and auxin transport-dependent development. We show that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and PID act antagonistically on phosphorylation of PIN proteins. Our findings demonstrate that decisions about apical or basal targeting in plants require reversible phosphorylation of cargo proteins. To identify a possible phosphatase component of the mechanism responsible for PIN polar targeting, we analyzed the three closely related regulatory A subunits of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex in Arabidopsis - PP2AA1, PP2AA2 and PP2AA3. We focused preferentially on the PP2A class since a loss-of-function mutation in one of the A regulatory subunits (PP2AA1), called ROOT CURLING ON NPA1 (RCN1) causes various developmental defects, some of which are in processes governed by auxin transport (Garbers et al., 1996Garbers Ch. DeLong A. Deruére J. Bernasconi P. Söll D. A mutation in protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit A affects auxin transport in Arabidopsis.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2115-2124PubMed Google Scholar, Rashotte et al., 2001Rashotte A.M. DeLong A. Muday G.K. Genetic and chemical reductions in protein phosphatase activity alter auxin transport, gravity response, and lateral root growth.Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1683-1697PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the expression pattern of PP2AA genes using PP2AA1::GUS, PP2AA2::GUS, PP2AA3::GUS and PP2AA1::PP2AA1:GFP fusions. Analysis of seedlings 4 and 8 days after germination (dag) revealed high and overlapping transcriptional activity for all three genes (Figures S1A–S1D in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In the root, PP2AA1 was expressed in the whole root tip, PP2AA2 prominently in the elongation zone and columella root cap, and PP2AA3 more restricted to the columella root cap (Figure 1A). These overlapping expression patterns of PP2AAs have been confirmed by analysis of global transcription data (http://www.weigelworld.org/resources/microarray/AtGenExpress) and are in accordance with previous reports (Zhou et al., 2004Zhou H.W. Nussbaumer C. Chao Y. DeLong A. Disparate roles for the regulatory A subunit isoforms in Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2A.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test the requirement of PP2AA activities for plant development, we isolated and analyzed phenotypes of pp2aa1, pp2aa2 and pp2aa3 double and triple mutant combinations. In line with previous observations (Zhou et al., 2004Zhou H.W. Nussbaumer C. Chao Y. DeLong A. Disparate roles for the regulatory A subunit isoforms in Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2A.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the pp2aa2 and pp2aa3 single mutants, and pp2aa2 pp2aa3 double mutants showed largely normal development (data not shown), but double-mutant combinations that included the pp2aa1 suffered from increasingly severe developmental aberrations (Figure 1B). Both pp2aa1 pp2aa2/+ and pp2aa1 pp2aa3/+ mutants displayed defects in root growth and root gravity response (n = 90) (Figures S2A and S2B). Also homozygous seedlings for pp2aa1 pp2aa2 and pp2aa1 pp2aa3 showed identical but more severe defects (Figures S2A and 1C). Primary root meristems typically collapsed at 6-8 dag (76% for pp2aa1 pp2aa2, n = 40; 80% for pp2aa1 pp2aa3, n = 50) as evident from the disturbance of proper patterning and lack of columella-specific lugol staining (Figure 1L). During subsequent development, initiation of numerous lateral roots substituted for a defective primary root (Figure 1D). About 30% (n = 90) of pp2aa1-containing double-mutant seedlings showed defects in cotyledon development. These included collar-shaped or fused cotyledons (10%) as well as aberrant positioning and irregular numbers of cotyledons (19%) (Zhou et al., 2004Zhou H.W. Nussbaumer C. Chao Y. DeLong A. Disparate roles for the regulatory A subunit isoforms in Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2A.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; Figure 1C). Because pp2aa1 pp2aa2 pp2aa3 triple mutant seedlings were not recovered among progeny of pp2aa1 pp2aa2 pp2aa3/+ plants (n = 87), we constructed transgenic lines with estrogen (4-hydroxytamoxifen)-inducible overexpression of two different artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) (Schwab et al., 2006Schwab R. Ossowski S. Riester M. Warthmann N. Weigel D. Highly specific gene silencing by artificial microRNAs in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) that simultaneously target all three PP2AA genes. In both amiRNA lines, we observed identical defects that were similar to but more severe than the phenotypes observed in pp2aa1 double mutants. These included root and cotyledon defects (Figure 1E), which resembled phenotypes seen in mutants compromised in auxin signaling (monopteros, Hardtke and Berleth, 1998Hardtke C.S. Berleth T. The Arabidopsis gene MONOPTEROS encodes a transcription factor mediating embryo axis formation and vascular development.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) or auxin transport (pins, Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G. Efflux-dependent auxin gradients establish the apical-basal axis of Arabidopsis.Nature. 2003; 426: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Functional primary and lateral root meristems were not established (n = 120), causing arrest of further growth at the seedling stage (Figure 1E). These results extend previous findings (Zhou et al., 2004Zhou H.W. Nussbaumer C. Chao Y. DeLong A. Disparate roles for the regulatory A subunit isoforms in Arabidopsis protein phosphatase 2A.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that PP2A activity (as assessed by downregulation of its regulatory A subunits) is important for seedling development. Importantly, our additional analysis highlighted that some features of loss of PP2AA function phenotypes including root agravitropism, cotyledon defects and root meristem collapse resemble auxin transport-related defects (reviewed in Friml, 2003Friml J. Auxin transport—shaping the plant.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and in particular gain-of-function PID Ser/Thr kinase phenotypes (35S::PID, Benjamins et al., 2001Benjamins R. Quint A. Weijers D. Hooykaas P. Offringa R. The PINOID protein kinase regulates organ development in Arabidopsis by enhancing polar auxin transport.Development. 2001; 128: 4057-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Friml et al., 2004Friml J.

The pronounced seedling patterning defects in pp2aa loss-of-function mutants suggested that PP2A activity is already required during embryo development. Analysis of PP2AA1,2,3::GUS embryos revealed transcriptional activity of all three genes from the 8-cell-stage onward. PP2AA1::GUS and PP2AA1::PP2AA1:GFP reporters showed strong expression throughout the whole embryo (Figures 2A and 2B). Expression of the PP2AA2::GUS was similar but slightly weaker and PP2AA3::GUS was only weakly detectable (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the development of mutant embryos from pp2aa1 pp2aa2/+ and pp2aa1 pp2aa3/+ plants. These embryos showed identical strong developmental aberrations as early as at the preglobular stages (Figures 2D–2I). Affected embryos (70%, n = 80) displayed a range of defects, including root pole (68%) and cotyledon (36%) misspecifications (Figures 2G and 2H). The most severe cases were characterized by embryos lacking a clearly defined apical-basal axis (3%) (Figure 2I). All these embryonic phenotypes resemble those of embryos with defects in auxin transport (Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G.

Several of the phenotype features in pp2aa loss-of -function embryos and seedlings suggested defects in auxin transport-related processes as an underlying cause. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed local auxin distributions in various pp2aa mutant backgrounds using a reporter system based on the synthetic auxin-responsive promoter DR5 (Ulmasov et al., 1997Ulmasov T.

Auxin transport—shaping the plant.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In globular and post-globular wild-type embryos, strong DR5 activity can be seen at the root pole (Figure 2J) and at later stages at tips of developing cotyledons (Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G. Efflux-dependent auxin gradients establish the apical-basal axis of Arabidopsis.Nature. 2003; 426: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). In embryos excised from DR5rev::GFP pp2aa1 pp2aa2/+ and DR5rev::GFP pp2aa1 pp2aa3/+ plants, we still observed the correct pattern of DR5 activity in about one-half of the analyzed embryos (56%, n = 80), but with reduced signal intensity (Figure 2L). In some embryos (18%), the DR5 activity maximum was misplaced (Figure 2K) whereas in others (26%) it was not detectable at all (data not shown). Next we examined the DR5 activity pattern in roots (Figures 1F–1H). We analyzed young (2.5 dag) pp2aa seedlings well before the collapse of the root meristem. In pp2aa1 pp2aa2/+ (Figure 1G) and pp2aa1 pp2aa3/+ (data not shown) root tips, the DR5 signal was strongly decreased. This reduction was even more pronounced in pp2aa1 pp2aa2 (data not shown) and pp2aa1 pp2aa3 (Figure 1H) double homozygous mutants. 53% (n = 40) of these roots showed strongly reduced DR5 intensity and in 20% the DR5 signal was not detectable at all. The observed changes in DR5 activity could be either due to alterations in auxin response or auxin distribution. To address this question, we treated pp2aa1 pp2aa2 and pp2aa1 pp2aa3 roots with the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or the auxin transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). 2,4-D caused a comparable induction of DR5 in both wild-type and mutant roots, suggesting that auxin response is unaffected (Figures S2G–S2J). Notably, NPA did rescue the decrease in the DR5 expression and the root meristem collapse of the pp2aa1 double mutants (Figures 1F–1M), as previously observed for 35S::PID seedlings (Figures 3A, 3F, and 3G; Benjamins et al., 2001Benjamins R. Quint A. Weijers D. Hooykaas P. Offringa R. The PINOID protein kinase regulates organ development in Arabidopsis by enhancing polar auxin transport.Development. 2001; 128: 4057-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the mutants are affected in auxin transport. To substantiate these observations, we assessed a possible defect in auxin transport of pp2aa mutants by monitoring auxin redistribution during gravity response. It is well established that the root gravitropic response is mediated by transport-dependent redistribution of auxin to the lower side of the responding root tip (e.g., Luschnig et al., 1998Luschnig C. Gaxiola R.A. Grisafi P. Fink G.R. EIR1, a root-specific protein involved in auxin transport, is required for gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2175-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type roots, which all responded (100%, n = 25), only about 23% of pp2aa1 pp2aa2/+ and pp2aa1 pp2aa3/+ roots (total n = 48) showed weak relocation of the DR5 signal following gravistimulation (Figures S2C–S2F; not shown). In summary, these data suggest that PP2A activity is required for transport-dependent auxin distribution in embryos and seedling roots. The same phenotypes as those caused by loss of PP2AA function, including embryo patterning defects, agravitropic root growth and decreased DR5 activity in roots followed by meristem collapse have also been observed in PID kinase gain-of-function seedlings (Benjamins et al., 2001Benjamins R. Quint A. Weijers D. Hooykaas P. Offringa R. The PINOID protein kinase regulates organ development in Arabidopsis by enhancing polar auxin transport.Development. 2001; 128: 4057-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Friml et al., 2004Friml J. Yang X. Michniewicz M. Weijers D. Quint A. Tietz O. Benjamins R. Ouwerkerk P.B. Ljung K. Sandberg G. et al.A PINOID-dependent binary switch in apical-basal PIN polar targeting directs auxin efflux.Science. 2004; 306: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). To test for genetic interactions between PID and PP2A, we introduced PID gain- and loss-of-function alleles (35S::PID and pid, respectively) into the pp2aa1 pp2aa3 background. pp2aa1 pp2aa3 35S::PID seedlings showed more severe phenotypes than either parental line (Figures 3B and 3C). Typically, the primary root meristem of 35S::PID seedlings collapses followed by essentially normal lateral root development (Benjamins et al., 2001Benjamins R. Quint A. Weijers D. Hooykaas P. Offringa R. The PINOID protein kinase regulates organ development in Arabidopsis by enhancing polar auxin transport.Development. 2001; 128: 4057-4067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, pp2aa1 pp2aa3 35S::PID plants (n = 36) failed to establish lateral root meristems and arrested growth as seedlings (Figures 3B and 3C). These defects were similar to those observed in amiRNA lines (see Figure 1E), in which all three PP2AA genes are downregulated. Conversely, the pid mutation partially suppressed pp2aa1 pp2aa3 double-mutant phenotypes. In pp2aa1 pp2aa3 pid mutant seedlings (n = 20), defects in root growth and root meristem maintenance, that are seen in pp2aa1 pp2aa3 double mutants, were rescued (Figures 3E and 3H). Nonetheless, additive phenotypes were observed in pp2aa1 pp2aa3 pid inflorescence axes (Figure 3D), suggesting additional, divergent roles of PID and PP2AA at later stages of above-ground development. Taken together, our genetic analysis strongly suggests that PP2AA Ser/Thr phosphatases and PID Ser/Thr kinase represent antagonistically acting regulators of embryo and root development. It has been suggested that PID kinase exerts its effect on polar auxin transport by controlling apical-basal targeting of the PIN auxin efflux carriers (Friml et al., 2004Friml J. Yang X. Michniewicz M. Weijers D. Quint A. Tietz O. Benjamins R. Ouwerkerk P.B. Ljung K. Sandberg G. et al.A PINOID-dependent binary switch in apical-basal PIN polar targeting directs auxin efflux.Science. 2004; 306: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine subcellular localization of PIN proteins in different pp2aa loss-of-function mutants. In pp2aa1 pp2aa2 and pp2aa1 pp2aa3 double-mutant embryos (total n = 45), the localization of PIN1 was impaired. Generally, basal (lower, root pole-facing) polarity of PIN1 localization was much less pronounced; in some cells a basal-to-apical polarity shift was detectable (Figure 4A). Also, the polarity of the PIN4 protein was affected during embryo development (n = 57) occasionally resulting in a complete apicalization of signal (data not shown). During postembryonic development, polar localization of PIN proteins in roots of 2.5 dag seedlings was also affected in all pp2aa1 double-mutant combinations. PIN2, which in the wild-type localizes to the basal side of young cortical cells, changed its polarity to apical (upper, shoot apex-facing) in approximately 60% (n = 110) of pp2aa1 double-mutant roots, whereas the apical localization in the epidermis cells remained unaffected (Figure 4B). Similarly, PIN4, which is basally localized in proximal initials and daughter cells of the wild-type root meristem, shifted to the apical side in approximately 20% (n = 90) of pp2aa1 double-mutant roots (Figure 4C). Basal localization of PIN1 as observed in wild-type stele cells was also affected in pp2aa1 double-mutant roots. Although no complete apicalization of PIN1 localization was detectable, the subcellular polarity of PIN1 was less pronounced in these double mutants (data not shown). When activity of all three PP2AAs was decreased in tamoxifen-inducible amiRNA l"

Here we describe the use of multiphoton intravital microscopy in intact BM to visualize platelet generation in mice. MKs were observed as sessile cells that extended dynamic proplatelet-like protrusions into microvessels. These intravascular extensions appeared to be sheared from their transendothelial stems by flowing blood, resulting in the appearance of proplatelets in peripheral blood. In vitro, proplatelet production from differentiating MKs was enhanced by fluid shear. These results confirm the concept of proplatelet formation in vivo and are consistent with the possibility that blood flow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress is a biophysical determinant of thrombopoiesis."

Achieving high-affinity binding is important for expanding detection limits, extending dissociation half-times, decreasing drug dosages and increasing drug efficacy. However, antibody-affinity maturation in vivo often fails to produce antibody drugs of the targeted potency1, making further affinity maturation in vitro by directed evolution or computational design necessary. Here we present an iterative computational design procedure that focuses on electrostatic binding contributions and single mutants. By combining multiple designed mutations, a tenfold affinity improvement to 52 pM was engineered into the anti–epidermal growth factor receptor drug cetuximab (Erbitux), and a 140-fold improvement in affinity to 30 pM was obtained for the anti-lysozyme model antibody D44.1. The generality of the methods was further demonstrated through identification of known affinity-enhancing mutations in the therapeutic antibody bevacizumab (Avastin) and the model anti-fluorescein antibody 4-4-20. These results demonstrate computational capabilities for enhancing and accelerating the development of protein reagents and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2001482654,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize conserved microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Signaling from TLRs leads to upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules for better priming of T cells and secretion of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells. Lymphocyte-deficient hosts often die of acute infection, presumably owing to their lack of an adaptive immune response to effectively clear pathogens. However, we show here that an unleashed innate immune response due to the absence of residential T cells can also be a direct cause of death. Viral infection or administration of poly(I:C), a ligand for TLR3, led to cytokine storm in T-cell- or lymphocyte-deficient mice in a fashion dependent on NK cells and tumor necrosis factor. We have further shown, through the depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in wild-type mice and the transfer of T lymphocytes into Rag-1-deficient mice, respectively, that T cells are both necessary and sufficient to temper the early innate response. In addition to the effects of natural regulatory T cells, close contact of resting CD4+CD25-Foxp3- or CD8+ T cells with innate cells could also suppress the cytokine surge by various innate cells in an antigen-independent fashion. Therefore, adaptive immune cells have an unexpected role in tempering initial innate responses."

We report here the structure of a complex between the PKA catalytic subunit and a mutant RI regulatory subunit, RIα(91–379:R333K), containing both cAMP-binding domains. Upon binding to the catalytic subunit, RI undergoes a dramatic conformational change in which the two cAMP-binding domains uncouple and wrap around the large lobe of the catalytic subunit. This large conformational reorganization reveals the concerted mechanism required to bind and inhibit the catalytic subunit.

Protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzyme is one of the major receptors for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), where an extracellular stimulus is translated into a signaling response.

Mutagenesis of these residues demonstrates their importance for PKA activation. Our structural insights, combined with the mutagenesis results, provide a molecular mechanism for the ordered and cooperative activation of PKA by cAMP. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling through cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a ubiquitous mammalian signaling pathway conserved in all eukaryotes, with the exception of the plant phyla. While the catalytic (C) subunit has served as a prototype for the protein kinase superfamily, the regulatory (R) subunit defines the mechanism whereby the second messenger, cAMP, translates an extracellular signal into an intracellular biological response. This mechanism of cAMP regulation is conserved from bacteria to man, and the domain that recognizes cAMP is likewise universal. The crystal structure of the catalytic subunit defined for the first time the conserved structural features of the protein kinase superfamily (Knighton et al., 1991bKnighton D.R. Zheng J.H.

Crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase.Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit is a globular bilobal protein with a highly dynamic small lobe that serves as the binding site for ATP, burying the adenine ring in a deep hydrophobic pocket and positioning the γ-phosphate for transfer to a protein substrate. The stable large lobe serves as a framework for the catalytic machinery and also as a docking scaffold for binding to protein partners that act as substrates or inhibitors (Cheng et al., 2001Cheng X.

Autoactivation of catalytic (C alpha) subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase by phosphorylation of threonine 197.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In PKA, this loop (residues 191–197, VKGRTWT) also functions as a major binding surface for the R subunit (Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, the R subunit is a highly dynamic and modular protein that serves as one of the major receptors for cAMP in eukaryotic cells. At the N terminus is a helical dimerization/docking (D/D) domain that interacts with scaffold proteins, referred to collectively as A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (Kinderman et al., 2006Kinderman F.S. Kim C. von Daake S. Ma Y. Pham B.Q. Spraggon G. Xuong N.H. Jennings P.A. Taylor S.S. A dynamic mechanism for AKAP binding to RII isoforms of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.Mol.

A novel mechanism of PKA anchoring revealed by solution structures of anchoring complexes.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Following this domain is a variable and flexible linker region containing an inhibitor site that docks to the active-site cleft of the C subunit. Two tandem cAMP-binding domains (domain A and domain B) lie at the C terminus. Each cAMP-binding domain consists of a β sandwich and a noncontiguous helical subdomain. Among the four known protein families that bind cyclic nucleotides (PKA/PKG, catabolite activator protein [CAP], hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated channel [HCN], and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP [EPAC]), the most conserved feature of each domain is the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC), a helix-loop region where cAMP binds. The C subunit is locked in a dormant state in the absence of cAMP through formation of a holoenzyme inhibitory complex, where the R subunit dimer binds to two C subunits. Binding of cAMP to the R subunit unleashes the catalytic subunit, thereby allowing phosphorylation of PKA substrates. There are two major classes of R subunits, RI and RII, which are functionally nonredundant; within these classes are α and β subtypes (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ) (Brandon et al., 1997Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. PKA isoforms, neural pathways, and behaviour: making the connection.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). While crystal structures for separate catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA are known, understanding the molecular features of this universal signaling pathway requires a structure of the holoenzyme complex. The recent structure of the C subunit bound to a deletion mutant of RIα containing only domain A provides clues to the dramatic conformational switch that the R subunit must undergo to release the C subunit and bind cAMP (Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This complex, however, lacked the second cAMP-binding domain, which is crucial for allosteric activation of PKA by cAMP. Activation of the type I holoenzyme by cAMP is a highly ordered process. In holoenzyme complexes with R subunits containing both cAMP-binding domains, domain A is inaccessible until cAMP occupies domain B (Herberg et al., 1996Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R. Active site mutations define the pathway for the cooperative activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Ogreid and Doskeland, 1981aOgreid D.

This obligatory activation pathway led to the designation of domain B as a “gatekeeper” for domain A. Here we report a holoenzyme structure that contains both cAMP-binding domains of RIα (domain A, residues 123–259, and domain B, residues 260–379). The complex reveals an extended R/C interface that protects sites in the C subunit essential for catalysis and substrate binding. It shows an extended interface surrounding the activation loop and defines a novel interaction site between domain B in RIα and an S-shaped loop (residues 276–286) on the large lobe of the catalytic subunit (subsequently referred to as the αH-αI loop). The structure also shows local conformational changes within the helical regions as well as dramatic global rearrangement of the two cAMP-binding domains as the R subunit wraps around the large lobe of the catalytic subunit. Finally, this new structure reveals a highly conserved holoenzyme-specific salt bridge formed in domain B involving two residues (Glu261 and Arg366) that are solvent exposed in the cAMP-bound conformation. In the holoenzyme, this salt bridge tethers the two adenine capping residues (Trp260 and Tyr371). The importance of this salt bridge and the two capping residues in facilitating PKA activation is confirmed by mutagenesis. Taken together, the molecular features revealed by this structure allow understanding of the communication pathway between the two cAMP-binding domains and provide a mechanism for the ordered and cooperative activation of PKA by cAMP. The holoenzyme crystal structure of a mutant RIα(91–379:R333K) in complex with the C subunit, AMP-PNP, and two Mn2+ ions was solved to 2.3 Å resolution using the RIα(91–244):C complex as a molecular replacement probe (Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We attempted to crystallize three deletion mutants of RIα (RIα(91–379), RIα(91–379:R209K), and RIα(91–379:R333K)) in complex with the C subunit (for rationale, see the Supplemental Results and Discussion in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), but only the holoenzyme formed with RIα(91–379:R333K) (subsequently referred to as RIα∗) produced crystals that diffracted. The RIα∗:C structure was crystallized in a P3221 space group with 73% solvent and shows minimum contact between symmetrically related molecules (Table S1). The surface area on the catalytic subunit that is masked by binding of RIα is approximately 3800 Å2 (Figure 1). As with the previous RIα(91–244) holoenzyme structure, the C subunit adopts a closed conformation with its active site bound to AMP-PNP, two Mn2+ions, and the inhibitor site of the R subunit. The previous RIα(91–244):C structure showed major reorganization of domain A upon binding to the C subunit (Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our new holoenzyme structure defines the full extent of the conformational change in the R subunit that must occur to accommodate the C subunit. As RIα adopts an extended dumbbell shape that complements the large lobe of the C subunit, the two cAMP-binding domains become uncoupled. The largest binding interface lies between the C subunit and domain A of the R subunit, while domain B extends the interaction surface and makes a contact to the αH-αI loop in the C subunit. As defined previously (Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), an extended surface on the C subunit is utilized for binding to the R subunit: (1) site 1, the predominantly acidic active site (Figure S1); (2) site 2, the substrate binding loop (P+1 loop, residues 198–205) and the hydrophobic αG helix (Figure S2); and (3) site 3, the activation loop (Figure 2B). The new RIα∗:C structure reveals expanded interaction surfaces at sites 1 and 3 and defines a fourth site, the αH-αI loop, that interacts uniquely with domain B in the R subunit (Figure 2C), supporting previous hydrogen/deuterium exchange data (Anand et al., 2003Anand G.S. Law D. Mandell J.G. Snead A.N. Tsigelny I. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Komives E.A. Identification of the protein kinase A regulatory RIalpha-catalytic subunit interface by amide H/2H exchange and protein docking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13264-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We first discuss new features of site 3 that are revealed by the structure and then describe site 4. Additional information regarding sites 1 and 2 can be found in the Supplemental Data. At site 3, separation of the RIα cAMP-binding domains provides an additional docking surface that fully encloses the activation loop of the C subunit within the R/C interface (Figures 2A and 2B). The previous RIα(91–244):C complex lacking domain B showed a dramatic extension of the αB/C helix in domain A, which docks against the activation loop and masks the region extending from the P+1 loop to the activation loop (Kim et al., 2005Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic and regulatory (RIalpha) subunits of PKA.Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In the RIα∗:C structure, the activation loop is now completely enclosed within the R/C interface and is sandwiched between the two cAMP-binding domains. The additional docking surface arises from complete extension of the αB/C helix from residues 226 to 250 through to the αA helix in domain B. The entire extension was not observed in the previous structure since the RIα construct terminated at residue 244. Strikingly, the residue used to cap the cAMP-binding site in domain A, Trp260R (hereafter, residues in the regulatory subunit are followed by a superscript R, while residues in the catalytic subunit are followed by a superscript C), packs against the N-terminal tip of the activation loop (Figure 2B, right). As described later, binding of the C subunit causes Trp260R to move nearly 30 Å away from the PBC in domain A. In addition to the first three sites that surround the C subunit active site, the RIα∗:C structure reveals a fourth distal site, formed exclusively between domain B of the R subunit and the large lobe of the C subunit. Site 4 consists of the αH-αI loop on the large lobe of the C subunit (residues 276–286) that docks to the αB helix of the R subunit (Figures 2A and 2C). A short segment within the αH-αI loop (residues 282–286) has been found to be an AGC kinase-specific insert (Kannan et al., 2007Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F.

USA. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis studies suggest that this is an allosteric site that is coupled to peptide recognition (Deminoff et al., 2006Deminoff S.J.

Furthermore, Arg355R in the R subunit αB helix forms multiple interactions with the catalytic subunit; participation of this residue is noteworthy as it is conserved in both RI and RII isoforms and is likely to be a hotspot for protein:protein interactions for cAMP-binding proteins in general. The RIa∗:C structure containing both cAMP-binding domains shows the major conformational change in the R subunit that must occur to enable binding to the catalytic subunit. In the cAMP-bound conformation, the two cAMP-binding domains, joined by the kinked αB/C helix in domain A, form a compact globular structure where the two domains pack together with a large interface (Figure 3A) (Su et al., 1995Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Regulatory subunit of protein kinase A: structure of deletion mutant with cAMP binding domains.Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The αB/C helix is anchored to domain B through hydrophobic interactions and is directly linked to Trp260R, the capping residue that stacks with cAMP in domain A. However, upon binding to the C subunit, the two domains separate and the R subunit adopts an extended dumbbell shape. The center of domain B moves over 60 Å away from its position in the cAMP-bound structure due to extension of the αB/C helix. The interface shared between the domains in the cAMP-bound structure is replaced by the C subunit in the holoenzyme. This large domain movement is rarely seen in proteins and arises from rotations at three pivot points along the αB/C helix (Figure 3B). (A) The regulatory subunit bound to cAMP is shown on the left (PDB ID code 1RGS, in black) and bound to the C subunit (in gray) on the right. The two hydrophobic capping residues important for cAMP binding to the regulatory subunit, Trp260R and Tyr371R, are shown with a van der Waals surface. (B) Left: the global extension of the regulatory subunit is described by rotations at three pivot points (Arg226, Gly235, and Tyr244) located on the αB/C helix. Right: structural alignment of domain A in the cAMP and catalytic subunit-bound conformations. Each cAMP-binding domain is comprised of two subdomains: a noncontiguous α-helical subdomain and a contiguous β sheet subdomain that contains the PBC. Superposition of the two conformational states of RIα (holoenzyme and cAMP-bound) shows that the conformation of the β sandwich, with the exception of the PBC, does not change (Figure 4). Removal of cAMP from the cAMP-bound complex creates a more dynamic structure but does not stabilize the open and extended conformation of the αB/C helix (Gullingsrud et al., 2006Gullingsrud J. Kim C.

A simple electrostatic switch important in the activation of type I protein kinase A by cyclic AMP.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Instead, the C subunit induces the major conformational change that RIα undergoes, and these changes are associated primarily with the helical regions (Figure 4). For each domain in the R subunit, this includes, in addition to the major changes in the αB/C helices discussed above, reorganization of the PBC and a conserved structural element that bridges the αX:N and αA helices in domain A (residues 123–150) and the αC helix of domain A with the αA helix of domain B (residues 245–267). We define this structural element as the N3A motif (Figure 5; Figure S6). A major consequence of the conformational changes in the R subunit, induced by binding of the catalytic subunit, is that both cAMP-binding sites are essentially destroyed because the phosphate-binding pocket is separated from the adenine-binding pocket. (A) Structural alignment of the regulatory subunit cAMP-binding domains in the holoenzyme conformation. Domains A and B are shown in red and black, respectively.

The cAMP-bound conformation is shown on the left, and the holoenzyme conformation is shown on the right. The two conformations are superimposed in the center. The αB/C helix is shown in red, and the PBC in yellow. In the two center panels, the cAMP-bound conformation is shown in gray. (A) Sequence alignment of domains A and B. Residues in the gray boxes belong to domain A but are also aligned as part of the N3A motif of domain B. (B) Cartoon schematic of the major structural elements of the regulatory subunit in the holoenzyme conformation. Figure 6 shows the region where the helical motifs (the αB/C helix, PBC, and N3A motif) converge in the holoenzyme structure. For domain A in the cAMP-bound state, the αB/C helix separates the surface formed between the PBC and N3A motif (Figure 6A, left). In the holoenzyme conformation, recruitment of the αB/C helix to the R/C interface and the associated conformational changes allow the remaining helices to reposition (Figure 6A, right). Essentially, the PBC and N3A motif move closer together to create a holoenzyme-specific hydrophobic surface in domain A that then docks onto the hydrophobic surface on the C subunit. (A) Comparison of the helical regions in domain A between the cAMP (left) and catalytic subunit-bound (right) conformations. Movement of the helical regions is mediated by hydrophobic rearrangement of the hinge residues in the PBC (Ile203R and Leu204R), αB helix (Tyr229R), and 310 loop (Leu135R). (B) Comparison of domain B in the cAMP and catalytic subunit-bound conformations, highlighting the C-terminal tail (red). In domain B, the helical rearrangements are similar to domain A where residues in the PBC (Leu327R and Leu328R), αB helix (Phe353R), and 310 loop (Ile253R and Leu254R) come together. (C) Comparison between domains A and B in the holoenzyme conformation. In domain A, the N3A motif (residues 123–150) and PBC come together and serve as a docking surface for the P+1 loop (black) and the αG helix (dark tan) of the catalytic subunit. In domain B, a similar hydrophobic interface is formed between the N3A motif (residues 245–367) and PBC; however, the C-terminal tail (αB, αC′, and αC″ helices) lies on top of the hydrophobic interface. The hydrophobic rearrangement associated with the helical regions in domain B is analogous to domain A, except that in domain A, the PBC and the extended αB/C helix are an integral part of the R/C interface (Figure 6B). In contrast to domain A, the PBC in domain B is solvent exposed due to the hydrophobic rearrangement and the docking of αB helix in domain B to the C subunit (Figure 1). The highly accessible cAMP-binding site in domain B observed in our structure explains kinetic studies showing domain B as the fast association site for cAMP in holoenzyme (Ogreid and Doskeland, 1981aOgreid D. Doskeland S.O. The kinetics of association of cyclic AMP to the two types of binding sites associated with protein kinase II from bovine myocardium.FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Comparison of domains A and B shows that the αB and αC helices do not extend in domain B as they do in domain A. Instead, they remain as distinct helices and form a helix-turn-helix motif that covers the hydrophobic surface (Figure 6C). This helix-turn-helix motif provides the hydrophobic lid (from Tyr371R) for the PBC in the cAMP-bound state. The extended conformation of RIα in the holoenzyme not only partitions the two cAMP-binding domains but also separates many of the key residues that anchor cAMP in the PBC, effectively destroying both cAMP-binding sites. A common feature for cAMP-binding proteins is hydrophobic capping of the cAMP adenine ring (Berman et al., 2005Berman H.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Goodsell D.S. Haste N.M. Kornev A. Taylor S.S. The cAMP binding domain: an ancient signaling module.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For CAP, HCN, and domain B of RIα, the hydrophobic capping residue is located in the αC helix of the cAMP-binding domain. For domain A of RIα, the capping residue is Trp260R, located at the beginning of the αA helix of domain B. Thus, for RIα, both capping residues (Trp260R for domain A and Tyr371R for domain B) are in domain B (Figure 3A). In the holoenzyme structure, the capping residues are far removed from their respective PBCs. Trp260R moves over 30 Å and docks onto the C subunit activation loop (Figure 2B). Trp260R, the only residue from domain B that binds directly to cAMP in domain A, is important for communication between the two cAMP-binding domains (Canaves et al., 2000Canaves J.M. Leon D.A. Taylor S.S. Consequences of cAMP-binding site mutations on the structural stability of the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15022-15031Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Figure 6B, Tyr371R in the cAMP-bound state has a dual role—aromatic stacking with the adenine base and hydrogen bonding to the conserved Glu324R in the PBC, which binds to the 2′OH of the ribose ring of cAMP. Mutational studies confirm the importance of this residue for cAMP binding (Bubis et al., 1988aBubis J. Neitzel J.J. Saraswat L.D. Taylor S.S.

Contribution of the carboxyl-terminal regional of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit to cyclic nucleotide interactions.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the holoenzyme conformation, Tyr371R is 13 Å away from the PBC. Thus, binding of the catalytic subunit to RIα prohibits many interactions that are needed to stabilize the cAMP-bound structure (see Supplemental Data for additional sites). The holoenzyme structure reveals a salt bridge formed between Glu261R and Arg366R. These two residues not only position the RIα C-terminal tail but also sequester the two adenine capping residues (Trp260R and Tyr371R) away from their cAMP-binding sites. In the cAMP-bound conformation, both of these highly conserved salt bridge residues are 15 Å apart where Arg366R is exposed to solvent and Glu261R is near the domain interface. It is only in the holoenzyme conformation that their true function can be appreciated. In effect, the salt bridge traps both hydrophobic residues far away from the cAMP-binding sites and forms a communication path that links the two R subunit cAMP-binding domains. Our holoenzyme structure provides a molecular model explaining the ordered and highly cooperative pathway for the activation of the type I holoenzyme. The biochemical details for this model were first proposed based on kinetic arguments (Ogreid and Doskeland, 1981aOgreid D. Doskeland S.O. The kinetics of association of cyclic AMP to the two types of binding sites associated with protein kinase II from bovine myocardium.FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Ogreid and Doskeland, 1981bOgreid D. Doskeland S.O. The kinetics of the interaction between cyclic AMP and the regulatory moiety of protein kinase II. Evidence for interaction between the binding sites for cyclic AMP.FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and were then confirmed with mutants of the essential arginine residues in the cAMP-binding pocket (Arg209R for domain A and Arg333R for domain B) (Herberg et al., 1996Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R. Active site mutations define the pathway for the cooperative activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To test this model and the contribution of the electrostatic trapping of the capping residues, we engineered four RIα(91–379) mutants (W260A, Y371A, E261A, and R366A) and measured the effect of these mutations on PKA activation. For each mutant, the inhibition of the C subunit was not affected (Figure S4). In contrast, there are differences in cAMP-mediated activation of PKA, as measured by a catalytic coupled assay (Cook et al., 1982Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Adenosine cyclic 3′,5′-monophosphate dependent protein kinase: kinetic mechanism for the bovine skeletal muscle catalytic subunit.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and a fluorescence polarization binding assay (Saldanha et al., 2006Saldanha S.A. Kaler G. Cottam H.B. Abagyan R. Taylor S.S. Assay principle for modulators of protein-protein interactions and its application to non-ATP-competitive ligands targeting protein kinase A.Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 8265-8272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme complexes formed with RIα mutants that contain a substitution of either Trp260R or Tyr371R with alanine were less sensitive to cAMP compared to the RIα(91–379) holoenzyme. RIα(91–379:W260A) requires 4.6-fold more cAMP, while RIα(91–379:Y371A) requires 9-fold more cAMP (Figure 7A; Figure S5). The difference for the W260A mutation can be attributed to the missing hydrophobic capping abilities of the aromatic side chain. The larger difference observed for the Y371A mutation is most likely due to the absence of both the aromatic cap and hydrogen bond, which together help stabilize cAMP in domain B. In contrast, holoenzyme complexes formed with RIα mutants that contain a substitution of either Glu261R or Arg366R with alanine were more sensitive to cAMP activation. The EC50 decreased from 13.5 nM for RIα(91–379) to 4.7 and 6.6 nM for RIα(91–379:E261A) and RIα(91–379:R366A) mutants, respectively. The differences in EC50 values for these salt bridge-deficient mutants are likely to be greater than 3-fold since 10 nM C subunit was used in our assays. Nevertheless, these results conclusively show that disrupting the salt bridge makes the holoenzyme more sensitive to cAMP and shifts the equilibrium toward a more “activation-prone” state. Not only are Glu261R and Arg366R conserved in all regulatory subunit isoforms, their homologous counterparts in domain A (Glu143R and Arg241R, respectively) provide equally important contributions to the molecular architecture of the holoenzyme (Figure S6). The highly cooperative interaction between the two tandem cAMP-binding domains of RIα allows the enzyme to respond rapidly to the second messenger cAMP. Data from our study and others suggest that several factors contribute to this cooperative process. Comparison of the Hill coefficients in the cAMP activation data for both capping residue mutants relative to wild-type RIα suggests that these residues play an important role in the cooperative cAMP activation process. The Hill coefficient was reduced significantly from 1.5 for wild-type to 0.9 and 1 for W260A and Y371A, respectively (Figure 7A). Mutations that remove the salt bridge between Glu261 and Arg366 also show reductions in the Hill coefficient (1.2 for both E261A and R366A), but the protein concentrations used in our assays may have limited our ability to determine true Hill coefficients since titration effects will also influence these values. Furthermore, previous studies show that Arg241R, which mediates a salt bridge between domain A (Arg241R) and domain B (Asp267R) (Figure 3A; Figure S6), not only disrupts high-affinity cAMP binding but also plays an important role in the cooperative coupling between the two domains (Symcox et al., 1994Symcox M.M. Cauthron R.D. Ogreid D. Steinberg R.A. Arg-242 is necessary for allosteric coupling of cyclic AMP-binding sites A and B of RI subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23025-23031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of both our data and others, it is apparent that cooperativity involves not just one residue, but a number of residues that all contribute to the activation process in a synergistic way. Previous biochemical data proposed an ordered and sequential pathway of cAMP binding to the type Iα holoenzyme in which cAMP must first bind to domain B and then to domain A (Herberg et al., 1996Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R. Active site mutations define the pathway for the cooperative activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our structural and mutagenesis data together provide corroboration for this mechanism and allow us to propose a molecular explanation for the highly ordered pathway for activation by cAMP in which domain B serves as a “gatekeeper” for cAMP access to domain A (Figure 7B). •Step 1: cAMP first binds to the PBC in domain B. The PBC in domain B is more accessible than in domain A. The cAMP-binding site in domain A is masked by the R/C interface so that Trp260R and Arg241R, key residues that stabilize cAMP binding, are not accessible. In fact, Trp260R, the hydrophobic capping residue for domain A, not only is 30 Å from the PBC in domain A but also is docked to the activation loop of the C subunit (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the PBC in domain A is partially occluded by the C subunit at the site 2 interface (Figure 1; Figure S2). Specifically, Tyr247C (in the αG helix of the C subunit) hydrogen bonds to Tyr205R, and the two subunits are docked through a hydrophobic interface at this site. These structural details are consistent with studies that find domain B to be the fast association site for cAMP in holoenzyme (Ogreid and Doskeland, 1981aOgreid D. Doskeland S.O. The kinetics of association of cyclic AMP to the two types of binding sites associated with protein kinase II from bovine myocardium.FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).•Step 2: We predict that recruitment of the C-terminal tail to stabilize cAMP in the PBC of domain B will disrupt the Glu261R-Arg366R salt bridge. Both our mutational studies and others (Kapphahn and Shabb, 1997Kapphahn M.A. Shabb J.B. Contribution of the carboxyl-terminal regional of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit to cyclic nucleotide interactions.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) show Tyr371R to be a critical element that influences PKA activation by cAMP. Mutation of Tyr371R to alanine results in a 9-fold increase in the level of cAMP needed to activate PKA compared to wild-type RIα, presumably due to removal of the hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding capabilities of this residue. In addition, single point mutations of either Glu261R or Arg366R that disrupt the salt bridge require 3-fold less cAMP to activate PKA, suggesting that positioning of the C-terminal tail is destabilized in the absence of the salt bridge.•Step 3: The R subunit undergoes a large conformational change in response to uncoupling the Glu261R-Arg366R salt bridge. Breaking the salt bridge also releases Trp260R, the capping residue for cAMP binding in domain A. Several observations support this idea. First, as seen in Figure 2C, the αB helix in domain B interacts with the αH-αI loop of C. The movement of the C-terminal tail toward the PBC in domain B weakens the interaction between the C subunit and domain B, thereby facilitating the conformational change. Second, in the holoenzyme complex, Trp260R is buried in the R/C interface. Since the Glu261R-Arg366R interaction structurally couples the two hydrophobic capping residues, Trp260R and Tyr371R, docking of cAMP to domain B breaks the salt bridge and pulls Trp260R away from the C subunit activation loop. These motions collectively destabilize the extended αB/C helix, and the concerted motions of domain B bring Trp260R toward the PBC in domain A.•Step 4: Binding of a second molecule of cAMP to the PBC in domain A is stabilized by Trp260R. Mutation of Trp260R to alanine showed a 4.6-fold decrease in cAMP sensitivity for PKA activation. It is apparent in our holoenzyme structure that a second cAMP molecule can only bind to the PBC in domain A if this domain is dislodged from the C subunit. It remains to be established whether the C subunit dissociates from the pseudosubstrate site in the R subunit before or after trapping cAMP in domain A, or whether these steps are coordinated.•Step 5: In the final step, release of the C subunit from the inhibitor site of the R subunit leads to activation of PKA. In this report, we describe the structure of the PKA catalytic subunit bound to a deletion mutant of RIα containing both cAMP-binding domains. The structure demonstrates the exceptional mobility of the cAMP-binding domains in RIα and confirms that there is a large movement of domain B relative to domain A as the R subunit shuttles between its binding partners, namely the catalytic subunit and cAMP. The conversion of the globular conformation of the cAMP-bound structure into a dumbbell-shaped holoenzyme complex, in which the two cAMP-binding domains are separated, is mediated by extension of the αB/C helix of domain A. The RIα∗:C structure also shows that the αB and αC helices in domain B are equally dynamic, but their conformations are very different from the αB/C helices in domain A. When bound to the C subunit, RIα utilizes a unique set of residues that stabilize the C subunit-bound conformation without directly participating in the R/C interaction. We show through mutagenesis that a conserved salt bridge plays a significant role in cAMP activation of PKA, most likely by trapping the two adenine capping residues in RIα away from their cAMP-binding sites. These hydrophobic capping residues also contribute to the cooperative activation of the enzyme through cAMP. These data provide for the first time a molecular explanation for the highly ordered pathway whereby binding of cAMP to domain B leads to the eventual activation of kinase activity."

Jurgens G. Geldner N. Friml J. Auxin inhibits endocytosis and promotes its own efflux from cells.Nature. 2005; 435: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Finally, endocytosis is involved in downregulation of PIN2 during the gravitropic response (Abas et al., 2006Abas L. Benjamins R. Malenica N. Paciorek T. Wirniewska J. Moulinier-Anzola J.C. Sieberer T. Friml J. Luschnig C. Intracellular trafficking and proteolysis of the Arabidopsis auxin-efflux facilitator PIN2 are involved in root gravitropism.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the intracellular routes taken by PIN proteins during their endocytic trafficking are highly differentiated (Jaillais et al., 2006Jaillais Y. Fobis-Loisy I. Miege C. Rollin C. Gaude T. AtSNX1 defines an endosome for auxin-carrier trafficking in Arabidopsis.Nature. 2006; 443: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). PIN1 used a GNOM endosomal pathway for its trafficking, while PIN2 can use another endosomal compartment for its recycling or degradation, which is characterized by the presence of the SNX1 protein (Jaillais et al., 2006Jaillais Y. Fobis-Loisy I. Miege C. Rollin C. Gaude T. AtSNX1 defines an endosome for auxin-carrier trafficking in Arabidopsis.Nature. 2006; 443: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). SNX1 is the first described plant sorting nexin and is orthologous to the human SNX1 (Vanoosthuyse et al., 2003Vanoosthuyse V. Tichtinsky G. Dumas C. Gaude T. Cock J.M. Interaction of calmodulin, a sorting nexin and kinase-associated protein phosphatase with the Brassica oleracea S locus receptor kinase.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HsSNX1 is a member of the retromer complex in mammalian cells (Seaman, 2005Seaman M.N. Recycle your receptors with retromer.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 68-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The retromer complex has a conserved structure and function from yeast to mammals. It is composed of five proteins involved in the recycling and retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) (Bonifacino and Rojas, 2006Bonifacino J.S. Rojas R. Retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, Seaman, 2005Seaman M.N. Recycle your receptors with retromer.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 68-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). By searching genome databases, we found that every member of the mammalian retromer complex is conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana (Vanoosthuyse et al., 2003Vanoosthuyse V. Tichtinsky G. Dumas C. Gaude T. Cock J.M. Interaction of calmodulin, a sorting nexin and kinase-associated protein phosphatase with the Brassica oleracea S locus receptor kinase.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, Oliviusson et al., 2006Oliviusson P. Heinzerling O. Hillmer S. Hinz G. Tse Y.C. Jiang L. Robinson D.G. Plant retromer, localized to the prevacuolar compartment and microvesicles in Arabidopsis, may interact with vacuolar sorting receptors.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1239-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar showed that three vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) proteins, namely VPS35 (At3g51310), VPS29 (At3g47810), and VPS26 (At5g53530) of the plant retromer complex are localized to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in tobacco BY2 cells. Additionally, VPS29 is involved in the maturation of the storage proteins 12S globulin and 2S albumin during seed development (Shimada et al., 2006Shimada T. Koumoto Y. Li L. Yamazaki M. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. AtVPS29, a Putative Component of a Retromer Complex, is Required for the Efficient Sorting of Seed Storage Proteins.Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise function of the retromer complex in cellular trafficking and development in plants remains unknown. In A. thaliana, three genes code for a VPS35 homolog (At2g17790, At1g75850, and At3g51310, which we designated here VPS35a, VPS35b, and VPS35c, respectively), two code for a VPS26 homolog (At5g53530 and At4g27690, which we designated VPS26a and VPS26b, respectively), and only one encodes VPS29 (At3g47810). In yeast and animal cells, VPS29 is required for stabilizing the retromer complex, and vps29 null mutants exhibit basically the same phenotype as any of the other retromer mutants (Seaman, 2005Seaman M.N. Recycle your receptors with retromer.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 68-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Moreover, VPS29 has a phosphoesterase fold, which acts as a protein interaction scaffold for retromer assembly, and exhibits a phosphoesterase catalytic activity in vitro (Collins et al., 2005Collins B.M. Skinner C.F. Watson P.J. Seaman M.N. Owen D.J. Vps29 has a phosphoesterase fold that acts as a protein interaction scaffold for retromer assembly.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Niu L. et al.Crystal structure of human vacuolar protein sorting protein 29 reveals a phosphodiesterase/nuclease-like fold and two protein-protein interaction sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22962-22967Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As only one gene encodes the plant VPS29 protein, we decided to investigate the function of VPS29 by analyzing three Arabidopsis null mutant alleles of vps29. Here we show that VPS29 is required in many aspects of plant development and is specifically required for proper PIN1 protein cycling downstream of GNOM. Then, we demonstrate that VPS29 is involved in PIN1 repolarization during lateral root formation. Similarly, PIN1 distribution and polarity is affected in vps29 embryo cells, leading to severe alterations of embryo development. Altogether, our data indicate that SNX1 endosomes and VPS29 play an active role in the formation of new axes of polarity during plant development by mediating trafficking and rerouting of PIN proteins. To study VPS29 function in A. thaliana, we analyzed three allelic T-DNA insertion lines in the VPS29 gene (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data, available with this article online). The three alleles were null mutants and exhibited the same sporophytic phenotype, which was fully complemented by transgenic expression of a genomic fragment spanning the VPS29 gene (Figures S1 and S2). These results indicate that VPS29 is the only gene impaired in the vps29 mutants. As previously shown by Shimada et al., 2006Shimada T. Koumoto Y. Li L. Yamazaki M. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. AtVPS29, a Putative Component of a Retromer Complex, is Required for the Efficient Sorting of Seed Storage Proteins.Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, vps29 plants had a dwarf phenotype compared with wild-type controls (Figure 1A). We found vps29 seedlings to exhibit abnormal cotyledons in their shape, number, and positioning (Figures 1B–1F, Figures S3 and S4 for quantitative data). Interestingly, the pin1 single or pin4 pin7 double mutants have similar defects in cotyledon number and positioning (Benkova et al., 2003Benkova E. Michniewicz M. Sauer M. Teichmann T. Seifertova D. Jurgens G. Friml J. Local, efflux-dependent auxin gradients as a common module for plant organ formation.Cell. 2003; 115: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). As cotyledons are embryonic leaves, we investigated early embryonic development of vps29 mutants. In comparison with wild-type controls, the stereotypical pattern of cell division in early embryos was affected in vps29 mutants (Figures 1G and 1H). In a significant number of vps29 embryos, the division plan of the apical cell of the embryo was compromised, as demonstrated by horizontal instead of vertical division (Figure 1H). At later stages, mutant embryos continued to exhibit abnormal shapes and cell division defects (see Figure S5 for quantitative data). Here again, the embryo defects in vps29 were reminiscent of some combinations of pin mutants, suggesting a role for VPS29 in regulating PIN protein function during embryogenesis (Blilou et al., 2005Blilou I. Xu J. Wildwater M. Willemsen V. Paponov I. Friml J. Heidstra R. Aida M. Palme K. Scheres B. The PIN auxin efflux facilitator network controls growth and patterning in Arabidopsis roots.Nature. 2005; 433: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G. Efflux-dependent auxin gradients establish the apical-basal axis of Arabidopsis.Nature. 2003; 426: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the root phenotype of vps29. Seedlings of vps29 had a reduced primary root length (Figures 1I and 1J) and displayed fewer secondary roots (Figures 1K and 1L) compared with the wild-type. In addition, roots and hypocotyls were agravitropic (Figure 1I). Thus, it appears that VPS29 is required at many stages of embryonic and postembryonic development. Moreover, our data indicate that the vps29 mutant has phenotypic defects very similar to those of some pin mutants. To some extent, phenotypic features of vps29 roots resembled those of snx1 mutants, although they were less severe in snx1 (Jaillais et al., 2006Jaillais Y. Fobis-Loisy I. Miege C. Rollin C. Gaude T. AtSNX1 defines an endosome for auxin-carrier trafficking in Arabidopsis.Nature. 2006; 443: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As SNX1 and VPS29 are possible components of the retromer complex in plants, we assumed that they are likely to cooperate in some common developmental pathways. We first quantitatively analyzed the shoot phenotype of two snx1 single mutant alleles (Figure S6), which had mild defects for both root and shoot development as compared with vps29. Then, we crossed the vps29 and snx1 mutant lines to examine the genetic interactions between VPS29 and SNX1. In an F3 population derived from the self-pollination of a VPS29/vps29 snx1/snx1 plant, we found VPS29/vps29 snx1/snx1 seedlings to show a stronger phenotype than the snx1 single mutant and harbor cotyledons with aberrant shapes, which was never the case for snx1 single mutants (Figure 2A and Figure S4). After flowering, VPS29/vps29 snx1/snx1 plants exhibited an intermediate phenotype between that of snx1 and vps29 single mutants (Figure 2B). However, of more than two hundred F3 plants analyzed, we did not find any vps29/vps29 snx1/snx1 double mutant plants, suggesting that the loss of function of these two genes is either gametophytic or embryonic lethal. Our previous analysis of snx1 mutants suggested that SNX1 is involved in polar auxin transport in roots (Jaillais et al., 2006Jaillais Y. Fobis-Loisy I. Miege C. Rollin C. Gaude T. AtSNX1 defines an endosome for auxin-carrier trafficking in Arabidopsis.Nature. 2006; 443: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The presence of a genetic interaction between SNX1 and VPS29 we detected here indicates that VPS29 is likely to contribute to this pathway, in both the root and the shoot. As VPS29 is a component of the Vps35-Vps29-Vps26 retromer subcomplex in yeast and mammals, we investigated whether such a retromer subcomplex might occur in plant cells. A two-hybrid screen confirmed the physical interaction between VPS35a and the other two retromer components, VPS26a and VPS29 (Figure 2C). To verify the existence of this subcomplex in plants, we carried out a coimmunoprecipitation experiment using a transgenic line expressing VPS29 fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Figure 2D). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of VPS35 and VPS26 isoforms associated with VPS29-GFP in the immunocomplex (Figure S7). Taken together, the genetic interaction between SNX1 and VPS29, the presence of the VPS35-VPS29-VPS26 retromer subcomplex in plants, and the reported degradation of VPS35 in the Arabidopsis mutant vps29-2/mag1-2 (Shimada et al., 2006Shimada T. Koumoto Y. Li L. Yamazaki M. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. AtVPS29, a Putative Component of a Retromer Complex, is Required for the Efficient Sorting of Seed Storage Proteins.Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggest that the retromer complex might be involved in the vps29-phenotype. To determine whether auxin distribution is affected in vps29, we used the DR5rev:GFP reporter line, which is a reporter of auxin maxima in Arabidopsis (Benkova et al., 2003Benkova E. Michniewicz M. Sauer M. Teichmann T. Seifertova D. Jurgens G. Friml J. Local, efflux-dependent auxin gradients as a common module for plant organ formation.Cell. 2003; 115: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G. Efflux-dependent auxin gradients establish the apical-basal axis of Arabidopsis.Nature. 2003; 426: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). In wild-type seedlings, the GFP signal driven by the DR5 promoter was restricted to the tip of the cotyledons (Figure 3A). In vps29, the GFP signal was greatly enhanced in the cotyledon tip and extended to the vascular tissue and margins of cotyledons (Figure 3A). In contrast, the DR5 reporter was less active at the primary root tip of vps29 than in the wild-type control (Figure 3B). Next, we asked whether sensitivity or response to auxin (or both) are altered in roots of the vps29 mutant. We treated roots with the transportable 1-Naphtalene-Acetic-Acid (NAA) auxin analog, which is known to artificially induce secondary root formation throughout the whole pericycle (Benkova et al., 2003Benkova E. Michniewicz M. Sauer M. Teichmann T. Seifertova D. Jurgens G. Friml J. Local, efflux-dependent auxin gradients as a common module for plant organ formation.Cell. 2003; 115: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). In vps29, we observed that poorly defined secondary root primordia were induced by NAA treatment (Figure 3C). This result indicates that vps29 is capable of sensing auxin treatment and subsequently initiating lateral root primordia, but is unable to produce fully polarized lateral roots. Similar results were observed in pin3 pin7 and pin1 pin3 pin4 mutants (Benkova et al., 2003Benkova E. Michniewicz M. Sauer M. Teichmann T. Seifertova D. Jurgens G. Friml J. Local, efflux-dependent auxin gradients as a common module for plant organ formation.Cell. 2003; 115: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Control of auxin transport by PIN1 is known to be crucial for vascular tissue development (Galweiler et al., 1998Galweiler L. Guan C. Muller A. Wisman E. Mendgen K. Yephremov A. Palme K. Regulation of polar auxin transport by AtPIN1 in Arabidopsis vascular tissue.Science. 1998; 282: 2226-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). In wild-type shoots, vascular tissue forms individual bundles (Figure 3D), which are partially fused in pin1 mutant and shows abnormal xylem proliferation (Galweiler et al., 1998Galweiler L. Guan C. Muller A. Wisman E. Mendgen K. Yephremov A. Palme K. Regulation of polar auxin transport by AtPIN1 in Arabidopsis vascular tissue.Science. 1998; 282: 2226-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Shoots of vps29 exhibited xylem overproliferation and a continuous xylem strand consisting of xylem poles fused to interfascicular parenchyma that differentiated into xylem (Figure 3D and Figure S8 for a more detailed analysis). As in pin1, phloem poles remained well separated and no overproliferation of phloem was detected. Altogether, our results suggest that vps29 has altered PIN function in polar auxin transport. To explore this hypothesis, we investigated the genetic interaction between vps29 and the pin1 auxin efflux carrier mutant. We chose pin1 because vps29-phenotypes resemble those of pin1 in many aspects, with the notable exception of the characteristic pin-formed inflorescent shoot apical meristem (SAM) phenotype (Galweiler et al., 1998Galweiler L. Guan C. Muller A. Wisman E. Mendgen K. Yephremov A. Palme K. Regulation of polar auxin transport by AtPIN1 in Arabidopsis vascular tissue.Science. 1998; 282: 2226-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). We found all seedlings generated from self-pollination of a vps29/vps29 PIN1/pin1 plant to exhibit a vps29-phenotype, meaning that vps29 pin1 double mutant seedlings cannot be distinguished from vps29 single mutant plants (Figure 3E and Figure S4). This result is consistent with a role for VPS29 in regulating PIN1 function during seedling development. After flowering, vps29 pin1 double mutant plants had an additive phenotype reflecting the sum of the two single mutant phenotypes; the plants were dwarf with a pin-shaped shoot (Figure 3F). This suggests that VPS29 does not control PIN1 function in the inflorescence SAM. This could be explained if VPS29 is not expressed in the inflorescence SAM, where PIN1 is active (Vernoux et al., 2000Vernoux T. Kronenberger J. Grandjean O. Laufs P. Traas J. PIN-FORMED 1 regulates cell fate at the periphery of the shoot apical meristem.Development. 2000; 127: 5157-5165PubMed Google Scholar). To test this assumption, we checked the expression pattern of VPS29 by in situ hybridization and by analyzing VPS29:VPS29-GUS-expressing lines. VPS29 transcripts were not detected in the SAM but were found in older organs and in flowers (Figure 3G and Figure S9). As PIN1 acts in the SAM to regulate organ formation and phyllotaxis in the shoot, this result explains why the vps29 single mutant did not display a pin-shaped-phenotype. Thus, it appears that VPS29 is a major mediator of PIN1 function during root, vascular tissue, and seedling development, where both VPS29 and PIN1 are expressed (Figure S9 and Benkova et al., 2003Benkova E. Michniewicz M. Sauer M. Teichmann T. Seifertova D. Jurgens G. Friml J.

Regulation of polar auxin transport by AtPIN1 in Arabidopsis vascular tissue.Science. 1998; 282: 2226-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), but is not involved in organ initiation at the SAM, where only PIN1 is expressed (Vernoux et al., 2000Vernoux T. Kronenberger J. Grandjean O. Laufs P. Traas J. PIN-FORMED 1 regulates cell fate at the periphery of the shoot apical meristem.Development. 2000; 127: 5157-5165PubMed Google Scholar). Another regulator of PIN1 function is the protein kinase PINOID (PID) (Christensen et al., 2000Christensen S.K. Dagenais N. Chory J. Weigel D. Regulation of auxin response by the protein kinase PINOID.Cell. 2000; 100: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). pid and pin1 single mutant phenotypes are very similar in both seedling and shoot development (Furutani et al., 2004Furutani M. Vernoux T. Traas J. Kato T. Tasaka M. Aida M. PIN-FORMED1 and PINOID regulate boundary formation and cotyledon development in Arabidopsis embryogenesis.Development. 2004; 131: 5021-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To address whether VPS29 and PID act in the same developmental pathways, we generated vps29 pid double mutants. vps29 pid seedlings showed a strong synergistic phenotype compared with the phenotype of single mutants (Figure 3E). Double mutant seedlings totally lacked cotyledons (Figure 3E) but had a functional SAM capable of generating leaves. However, leaves were often fused and formed a radial cup surrounding the SAM (Figure S10). Interestingly, similar phenotypes were reported for pin1 pid double mutants (Furutani et al., 2004Furutani M. Vernoux T. Traas J. Kato T. Tasaka M. Aida M. PIN-FORMED1 and PINOID regulate boundary formation and cotyledon development in Arabidopsis embryogenesis.Development. 2004; 131: 5021-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (see Figure 3E and Figure S10). In the vps29 pid double mutant, vps29 mimics the defect provided by the loss of function of PIN1 in the pin1 pid double mutant. These results strongly argue for a role for VPS29 in regulating PIN1 function during seedling development. Altogether, our data indicate that VPS29 is required for the establishment of normal DR5 maxima in cotyledons and roots, and that some features of the vps29-phenotype can be explained by alteration of PIN1 function. In tobacco BY2 cells, VPS29 colocalizes with two other retromer components, VPS35 and VPS26, and with vacuolar sorting receptor-1 (VSR1) at the surface of MVBs (Oliviusson et al., 2006Oliviusson P. Heinzerling O. Hillmer S. Hinz G. Tse Y.C. Jiang L. Robinson D.G. Plant retromer, localized to the prevacuolar compartment and microvesicles in Arabidopsis, may interact with vacuolar sorting receptors.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1239-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To ascertain the subcellular localization of VPS29 in intact Arabidopsis root apices, we used the same genomic construct as that for the complementation experiment, but we added the coding sequence of the GFP at the 3′ end (Figure S2). This construct was functional; it can fully rescue the vps29 mutant (Figure S2). We analyzed VPS29-GFP localization in living Arabidopsis roots and found the fusion protein to label punctate structures in the cytosol (Figure 4A). VPS29-GFP-labeled compartments were sensitive to both Wortmannin (Wm) (Figure 4B) and Brefeldin A (BFA) (Figures 4C–4E), which are two drugs that alter endosomes (Jaillais et al., 2006Jaillais Y. Fobis-Loisy I. Miege C. Rollin C. Gaude T. AtSNX1 defines an endosome for auxin-carrier trafficking in Arabidopsis.Nature. 2006; 443: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Additionally, VPS29-GFP-labeled compartments were stained by the FM4-64 endocytic tracer after 15 min of dye treatment (Figures 4F–4H). Next, we crossed the VPS29:VPS29-GFP-expressing line with either a 35S:mRFP-RABF2b or a functional SNX1:SNX1-mRFP expressing line, which are both endosome marker lines (Jaillais et al., 2006Jaillais Y.

USA. 2005; 102: 12276-12281Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In hybrid seedlings, we detected a strong colocalization between VPS29-GFP and mRFP-RABF2b (Figures 4I–4K) or SNX1-mRFP (Figures 4L–4N). In contrast, VPS29 did not colocalize with the Golgi, TGN, or GNOM endosome markers in root cells (Figure S11). Altogether, our localization study indicates that VPS29 is localized to SNX1 endosomes in Arabidopsis roots. Next, we investigated the impact of VPS29 loss of function on the morphology of endosomal compartments. In vps29, both GFP-RABF2b and SNX1-GFP markers were found in aberrant enlarged endosomes (Figures 5A–5D). To determine whether VPS29 loss of function affects SNX1 endosomes specifically, we introgressed a GNOM:GNOM-GFP or VHA-a1:VHA-a1-GFP reporter line in the vps29 mutant (Dettmer et al., 2006Dettmer J.

Importantly, while sister neurites are repelled, nonsister neurites (i.e., from different cells) do not recognize one another as self and are not repelled from each other. In this way, self-avoidance ensures that sister branches segregate from one another to achieve uniform coverage of receptive fields while allowing neurites of different neurons to overlap. Self-avoidance was first described for axonal processes in the leech (Kramer et al., 1985Kramer A.P. Goldman J.R. Stent G.S.

In the early 1980s, Kramer and Kuwada proposed that self-avoidance is more generally required for patterning axonal and dendritic processes in the central nervous system (CNS) (Kramer and Kuwada, 1983Kramer A.P. Kuwada J.Y. Formation of the receptive fields of leech mechanosensory neurons during embryonic development.J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 2474-2486PubMed Google Scholar). Given the vast number of neurons in the CNS with overlapping dendritic and axonal processes, it seems likely that many cell surface molecules would be necessary to allow processes to distinguish between self and nonself. Previous studies led us to propose that the Ig superfamily proteins encoded by the Drosophila Down's syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene are cell surface molecules that mediate self-avoidance in the developing CNS (Neves et al., 2004Neves G.

Dscam encodes 38,016 cell surface proteins with both variable and constant Ig domains (Figure 1A) (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Drosophila Dscam is an axon guidance receptor exhibiting extraordinary molecular diversity.Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). These isoforms are generated through alternative splicing. Each isoform contains a large ectodomain with ten Ig domains and six fibronectin type III repeats. Of these, three Ig domains, Ig2, Ig3, and Ig7, contain variable sequences. Each variable domain is encoded by a block of alternatively utilized exons containing 12, 48, and 33 exons for Ig2, Ig3, and Ig7, respectively. As splicing within each block is independent of the other two, the Dscam locus encodes 19,008 different ectodomains (i.e., 12 × 48 × 33) linked to one of two alternative transmembrane domains. Previously, we demonstrated that 11 Dscam isoforms exhibit homophilic binding (Wojtowicz et al., 2004Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L. Clemens J.C. Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam generates axon guidance receptors that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding.Cell. 2004; 118: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). By contrast, little if any heterophilic binding was seen between 12 pairs examined. These preferential homophilic interactions occur in trans between molecules expressed on opposing cell surfaces (Matthews et al., 2007Matthews B.J. Kim M.E. Flanagan J.J. Hattori D. Clemens J.C. Zipursky S.L. Grueber W.B. Dendrite sef-avoidance is controlled by Dscam.Cell. 2007; 129: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that Dscam is required for self-avoidance in the Drosophila PNS (Hughes et al., 2007Hughes M.E. Bortnick R. Tsubouchi A. Baumer P. Kondo M. Uemura T. Schmucker D.

Drosophila sensory neurons require Dscam for dendritic self-avoidance and proper dendritic field organization.Neuron. 2007; 54: 403-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here the dendrites of four classes of dendritic arborization sensory neurons elaborate overlapping receptive fields. Whether sister dendrites and the dendrites of neighboring neurons grow across (i.e., overlap with) one another can be readily assessed in this system due to the two-dimensional pattern of these processes within the body wall. While sister dendrites do not overlap, the dendrites of different neurons overlap extensively. In Dscam mutant neurons, sister dendrites lose self-avoidance and remain associated with each other. Gain-of-function studies support a model for Dscam-mediated homophilic repulsion. Ectopic expression of the same Dscam isoform in two neurons, which normally share overlapping receptive fields, causes their dendrites to recognize one another as self (Hughes et al., 2007Hughes M.E.

Drosophila sensory neurons require Dscam for dendritic self-avoidance and proper dendritic field organization.Neuron. 2007; 54: 403-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This leads to avoidance of nonsister dendrites and the formation of mutually exclusive receptive fields. By contrast, deletion of the Dscam cytoplasmic domain results in adhesion of dendrites rather than repulsion (Matthews et al., 2007Matthews B.J. Kim M.E. Flanagan J.J. Hattori D. Clemens J.C. Zipursky S.L. Grueber W.B. Dendrite sef-avoidance is controlled by Dscam.Cell. 2007; 129: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we proposed that Dscam-mediated repulsion proceeds in two steps. First, homophilic binding occurs between identical Dscam isoforms expressed on sister dendrites. And second, cytoplasmic domain-dependent signaling promotes receptor downregulation and repulsion. Gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes are consistent with Dscam-mediated self-avoidance in both dendrites and axons in the developing CNS (Hattori et al., 2007Hattori D. Demir E. Kim H.W. Viragh E.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For Dscam to provide self-recognition, each neuron must express different isoforms. Studies by Chess and colleagues suggest that this is achieved in a stochastic fashion (Neves et al., 2004Neves G. Zucker J. Daly M. Chess A. Stochastic yet biased expression of multiple Dscam splice variants by individual cells.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Each neuron is proposed to express a random set of some 10 to 50 Dscam isoforms. Due to the large repertoire of Dscam isoforms, it is unlikely that processes from different neurons, which encounter each other within the developing brain, will express an appreciable number of the same isoforms. In this way, each neuron has a unique Dscam identity, which endows its processes with the ability to recognize self. To ensure the fidelity of self-recognition, it is essential that the vast majority of Dscam isoforms exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding. This degree of recognition specificity would be unprecedented outside the vertebrate immune system. Based on the homophilic binding properties of 11 isoforms, or 0.06% of the isoforms encoded by the locus, we speculated that isoform-specific homophilic binding is a feature shared by all 19,008 isoforms (Wojtowicz et al., 2004Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L. Clemens J.C. Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam generates axon guidance receptors that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding.Cell. 2004; 118: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We proposed that this specificity is achieved in a modular fashion: Ig2 in one molecule binds to an identical Ig2 in an opposing molecule, Ig3 binds to an identical Ig3, and Ig7 binds to an identical Ig7 (Figure 1B). Thus, isoforms sharing the same combination of variable domains will selectively bind to each other. In this paper we present evidence that >18,000 of the 19,008 Dscam ectodomain isoforms exhibit homophilic binding specificity. We describe a high-throughput ELISA-based binding assay which allowed us to screen interactions between thousands of Dscam isoform pairs. We provide evidence that homophilic binding is achieved in a modular fashion with each variable domain exhibiting highly specific self-binding. By swapping specificity determinants between domains, we show that each of the three variable domains achieves specificity through variations in sequence within a discrete structural element. Together these data reveal a novel strategy for generating a vast array of cell recognition molecules with different specificities through the mixing and matching of variable modules. In order to systematically test the binding specificities of Dscam isoforms, we developed an ELISA-based binding assay that provides an efficient method to assess interactions between thousands of isoform pairs (Figure 1C). The advantages of this assay, when compared with other binding assays, are outlined in Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online. The ELISA-based assay allows the binding properties of proteins to be assessed without purification and is quantitative over a 70-fold range (data not shown). Dscam ectodomains were tested for binding directly from the cell culture medium, into which they are secreted following small-scale transient transfection. Ectodomains were generated in two different C-terminally fused versions to (1) alkaline phosphatase (Dscam-AP) and (2) human IgG1 Fc (Dscam-Fc). These proteins were quantified (see Experimental Procedures), the levels of Dscam-AP and Dscam-Fc were normalized, and binding between them was tested in an ELISA plate format. Clustering of both Dscam-AP and Dscam-Fc was essential to detect binding (Figure S2), thereby suggesting that avidity compensates for low-affinity interactions between monomers. Experiments were conducted in a grid format wherein homophilic interactions are tested along the grid diagonal while heterophilic interactions are tested off-diagonal. This assay has also been used to evaluate the binding properties of other cell surface proteins (M.Y. Pecot and S.L.Z., unpublished data). Our previous studies (Wojtowicz et al., 2004Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L. Clemens J.C. Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam generates axon guidance receptors that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding.Cell. 2004; 118: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the data presented in this paper (see below), and the structure of Ig1-4 (containing Ig2.1 and Ig3.34 variable domains) determined by Meijers et al., 2007Meijers R. Puettmann-Holgado R. Skiniotis G. Liu J.-H. Walz T. Wang J.-H. Schmucker D. Structural basis of Dscam isoform specificity.Nature. 2007; (Published online August 26, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar strongly argue that binding specificity is determined in a modular fashion wherein binding at each pair of identical variable Ig domains occurs independent of the identity of the other variable Ig domains (Figure 1B). Thus, whether or not the majority of Dscam isoforms exhibit preferential homophilic binding specificity depends upon whether each of Dscam's 93 different variable domains (i.e., 12 different Ig2s, 48 different Ig3s, and 33 different Ig7s) preferentially binds to an identical domain in an opposing molecule. To assess the binding specificity of each variable domain, isoforms comprising the N-terminal nine Ig domains and one fibronectin type III repeat (a region of the ectodomain that contains all three variable Ig domains and has previously been shown to be sufficient for homophilic binding [Wojtowicz et al., 2004Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L. Clemens J.C. Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam generates axon guidance receptors that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding.Cell. 2004; 118: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar]) were made as both Fc and AP fusions in three sets: (1) all 12 variable Ig2 domains with a constant Ig3 and Ig7; (2) 47 of the 48 Ig3 domains with a constant Ig2 and Ig7; and (3) all 33 Ig7 domains with a constant Ig2 and Ig3 (Figure 2A). Variable domain Ig3.11 was not tested, as cDNAs encoding it were not identified. All pairwise combinations within each set were tested for binding (i.e., 12 × 12 for Ig2, 47 × 47 for Ig3, and 33 × 33 for Ig7). As shown in Figures 2B–2D, all 12 Ig2 variable domains, all 47 Ig3 variable domains, and 32 of 33 variable Ig7 domains support preferential homophilic binding. Ig7.33 was the only domain that did not support homophilic binding. Some variable Ig domains supported heterophilic binding, which in all cases was weaker than their homophilic binding. Heterophilic binding occurred largely between variable domains encoded by closely related alternative exons as illustrated by the dendrograms in Figure 2. In some cases (i.e., 24/137) reciprocal binding pairs gave different results. The reason for this is unknown. Each heterophilic pair was tested in a reciprocal fashion (i.e., A-AP to B-Fc and B-AP to A-Fc). There were eight examples of heterophilic binding out of the 132 Ig2 pairs tested (6%), 110 out of the 2162 Ig3 pairs tested (5%), and 19 out of the 1058 Ig7 pairs tested (2%). The Ig2, Ig3, and Ig7 grid binding experiments support the modular model for homophilic binding (i.e., three separate interfaces); however, they do not rule out the possibility that all three variable domains contribute jointly to the generation of a single interface (see Figure 1B). If the modular model is correct, then the binding profile of each variable domain (i.e., the domains with which it exhibits heterophilic interactions and the domains with which it does not) will be independent of the identity at the other two variable domains (Figure 3A). This will not be the case if all three variable domains combine to form a single interface. We selected a subset of variable domains from the Ig2, Ig3, and Ig7 binding grids that support heterophilic binding to some variants but not to others and tested them for binding in a different context. For example, Ig2 domain variants were placed in the context of a different Ig3 and Ig7 from those used in the initial grid experiments in Figure 2B. We observed that the unique binding profiles of individual variable domains are exhibited independent of the context of the other two variable domains (as indicated by the identical grid patterns in Figure 3B). These findings strongly argue that binding specificity arises from a modular molecular strategy of Ig2 to Ig2, Ig3 to Ig3, and Ig7 to Ig7 binding. In summary, the vast majority of variable domains (i.e., 91/93) exhibit preferential self-binding. This binding occurs independent of the identity at the other variable domains for all domains tested (i.e., 15/93). Modular self-binding at each variable domain provides a molecular strategy for achieving homophilic specificity. These findings argue that the vast majority of Dscam isoforms (i.e., 12 × 47 × 32 = 18,048) exhibit preferential homophilic binding. To achieve highly specific self-binding at each of the three variable domains, one molecular strategy for self-recognition may have evolved that was then utilized by all three variable domains, or alternatively, each of the three variable domains may have evolved a unique strategy. We therefore sought to assess how self-binding is achieved at each of the three variable domains. We reasoned that (1) if closely related domains bind weakly or not at all to one other, then one or more of the residues that differ between them must be critical for determining binding specificity, and (2) specificity residues would be surface exposed and localized within a discrete region or element within the domain. To identify candidate specificity-determining residues, we used primary amino acid sequence analysis, the binding properties of closely related Ig domains, molecular modeling (for Ig7), and the crystal structure of Ig1-Ig4 (containing Ig2.1 and Ig3.34) solved by Meijers et al., 2007Meijers R. Puettmann-Holgado R. Skiniotis G. Liu J.-H. Walz T. Wang J.-H. Schmucker D.

If amino acid differences within the specificity-determining elements of the variable domains confer unique binding properties to isoforms, then “swapping” these differences between variable domains should swap their binding specificity (Figure 4A). The specificity-swapping approach enabled us to identify sequences that are not only necessary but sufficient to confer unique binding properties to each of the three variable Ig domains. Representative examples of specificity swapping are shown for all three variable domains in Figure 4, Figure 5. Many additional examples are shown in Figures S4–S6. Ig1-4 fragments of Dscam form dimers in the crystal structure as determined by Meijers et al., 2007Meijers R. Puettmann-Holgado R. Skiniotis G. Liu J.-H. Walz T. Wang J.-H. Schmucker D. Structural basis of Dscam isoform specificity.Nature. 2007; (Published online August 26, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar. The binding interface is defined by an antiparallel pairwise matching of Ig2 to Ig2 and Ig3 to Ig3. The Ig2-Ig2 binding interface occurs between the same β strand, called the A′ β strand, in each monomer (Figure 4B). The Ig3-Ig3 interface occurs along a segment between two β strands, called the A–A′ segment, which loops away from each domain much like a teapot handle (Figure 4C). We reasoned that, if swapping Ig2 A′ β strands and Ig3 A–A′ segments swaps binding specificity in diverse Ig2 and Ig3 variants, then in all likelihood, the variation within these discrete structural elements determines the specificity of all Ig2 and Ig3 domains. To assess whether residues along the A′ β strand are sufficient to confer the binding specificity of Ig2 variants, we first swapped the surface-exposed strand residues that form direct contacts between interacting Ig2 monomers in the crystal structure. Surprisingly, isoforms containing surface-swapped Ig2 domains did not have swapped binding specificity. Instead, they exhibited both homophilic and robust, promiscuous heterophilic binding (Figure S3). We reasoned that the inward-facing residues, along with the surface-exposed residues, on the A′ β strand contribute to specificity. Therefore, we swapped the entire A′ β strand between pairs of variable Ig2 domains and the entire A–A′ segment between pairs of variable Ig3 domains. Strand swaps were performed for all 12 Ig2 variable domains, and segment swaps were performed for seven highly diverse Ig3 domains sharing as low as 22% amino acid sequence identity. All entire strand and segment-swapped isoforms bound to isoforms with which they shared strand or segment identity regardless of the identity of the remainder of the variable domain (i.e., domain backbone) (Figures 4B and 4C; Figures S4 and S5). They bound to themselves (i.e., homophilically). They did not bind to the wild-type isoform from which they were generated (i.e., isoform with the same domain backbone but different strand or segment). Importantly, swapped isoforms now bound to the wild-type isoform with which they shared strand or segment identity in spite of a differing domain backbone. This argues that the A′ β strand and the A–A′ segment are the specificity elements for most, if not all, Ig2 and Ig3 domains, respectively. Thus, these short contiguous polypeptide stretches are both necessary and sufficient for homophilic binding specificity within the Ig2 and Ig3 domains. As a crystal structure of Ig7 is not available, we used a combined biochemical and modeling approach to define the specificity determinants in Ig7. Candidate Ig7 specificity-determining residues were identified using three closely related Ig7 domains that exhibited little or no heterophilic binding to each other. There are seven to nine amino acid differences between each pair. They all differ at residue 23,"

Spin states of iron in lower-mantle ferropericlase have been measured up to 95 gigapascals and 2000 kelvin with x-ray emission in a laser-heated diamond cell. A gradual spin transition of iron occurs over a pressure-temperature range extending from about 1000 kilometers in depth and 1900 kelvin to 2200 kilometers and 2300 kelvin in the lower mantle. Because low-spin ferropericlase exhibits higher density and faster sound velocities relative to the high-spin ferropericlase, the observed increase in low-spin (Mg,Fe)O at mid-lower mantle conditions would manifest seismically as a lower-mantle spin transition zone characterized by a steeper-than-normal density gradient."

Bright gully deposits identify six locations with very recent activity, but these lie on steep (20 degrees to 35 degrees) slopes where dry mass wasting could occur. Thus, we cannot confirm the reality of ancient oceans or water in active gullies but do see evidence of fluvial modification of geologically recent mid-latitude gullies and equatorial impact craters."

https://openalex.org/W2029421259,"Whether the Late Pleistocene hominin fossils from Flores, Indonesia, represent a new species, Homo floresiensis, or pathological modern humans has been debated. Analysis of three wrist bones from the holotype specimen (LB1) shows that it retains wrist morphology that is primitive for the African ape-human clade. In contrast, Neandertals and modern humans share derived wrist morphology that forms during embryogenesis, which diminishes the probability that pathology could result in the normal primitive state. This evidence indicates that LB1 is not a modern human with an undiagnosed pathology or growth defect; rather, it represents a species descended from a hominin ancestor that branched off before the origin of the clade that includes modern humans, Neandertals, and their last common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2036609423,"Athabasca Valles is a young outflow channel system on Mars that may have been carved by catastrophic water floods. However, images acquired by the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft reveal that Athabasca Valles is now entirely draped by a thin layer of solidified lava-the remnant of a once-swollen river of molten rock. The lava erupted from a fissure, inundated the channels, and drained downstream in geologically recent times. Purported ice features in Athabasca Valles and its distal basin, Cerberus Palus, are actually composed of this lava. Similar volcanic processes may have operated in other ostensibly fluvial channels, which could explain in part why the landers sent to investigate sites of ancient flooding on Mars have predominantly found lava at the surface instead."

In contrast, the biological functions of the intracellular serpins remain obscure. We now report that the C. elegans intracellular serpin, SRP-6, exhibits a prosurvival function by blocking necrosis. Minutes after hypotonic shock, srp-6 null animals underwent a catastrophic series of events culminating in lysosomal disruption, cytoplasmic proteolysis, and death. This newly defined hypo-osmotic stress lethal (Osl) phenotype was dependent upon calpains and lysosomal cysteine peptidases, two in vitro targets of SRP-6. By protecting against both the induction of and the lethal effects from lysosomal injury, SRP-6 also blocked death induced by heat shock, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and cation channel hyperactivity. These findings suggest that multiple noxious stimuli converge upon a peptidase-driven, core stress response pathway that, in the absence of serpin regulation, triggers a lysosomal-dependent necrotic cell death routine.

These findings suggest that multiple noxious stimuli converge upon a peptidase-driven, core stress response pathway that, in the absence of serpin regulation, triggers a lysosomal-dependent necrotic cell death routine. Serpins are the quintessential regulators of extracellular serine peptidase pathways, where they prevent the deleterious effects of excessive peptide bond hydrolysis (Law et al., 2006Law R.H. Zhang Q. McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Silverman G.A. Wong W. Rosado C.J. Langendorf C.G. Pike R.N.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). For example, thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin, is generated by activated upstream peptidases including coagulation factors X (fXa) and fIXa (Church et al., 2007Church F.C. Pike R.N. Tollefsen D.M. Buckle A.M. Ciaccia A.V. Olson S.T. Regulation of hemostasis by heparin-binding serpins.in: Silverman G.A. Lomas D.A.

Antithrombin prevents excessive thrombosis by inhibiting fXa, fIXa, and a thrombin-mediated amplification loop that perpetuates zymogen conversion. Thus, serpins regulate proteolytic pathways by inhibiting multiple peptidases and by employing a unique suicide-substrate-like mechanism to irreversibly terminate enzymatic activity. Serpins, with over 1500 representatives in Archaea, Prokarya, and Eukarya as well as some viruses, are the largest and most widely dispersed family of peptidase inhibitors (Law et al., 2006Law R.H. Zhang Q. McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Silverman G.A. Wong W. Rosado C.J. Langendorf C.G. Pike R.N. Bird P.I. et al.An overview of the serpin superfamily.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The 37 human serpins are divided into 9 clades (A–I) (Silverman et al., 2001Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.I. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. et al.The serpins are an expanding superfamily of structurally similar but functionally diverse proteins: Evolution, mechanism of inhibition, novel functions, and a revised nomenclature.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Most of these serpins are secreted and constitute ∼10% of the plasma proteins. In contrast, the vertebrate clade B serpins belong to a larger intracellular subfamily (Silverman et al., 2004Silverman G.A. Whisstock J.C. Askew D.J. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Irving J.A. Bird P.I. Human clade B serpins (ov-serpins) belong to a cohort of evolutionarily-dispersed intracellular proteinase inhibitor clades that protect cells from promiscuous proteolysis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 301-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The intracellular serpins (serpinsIC) lack cleavable N-terminal signal peptides and dwell within the nucleo-cytosolic compartment. Several serpinsIC also neutralize papain-like lysosomal cysteine peptidases, but the biological significance of this activity is unknown (Silverman et al., 2004Silverman G.A. Whisstock J.C. Askew D.J. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Irving J.A. Bird P.I. Human clade B serpins (ov-serpins) belong to a cohort of evolutionarily-dispersed intracellular proteinase inhibitor clades that protect cells from promiscuous proteolysis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 301-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on their subcellular location, we postulate that serpinsIC provide an important survival function by limiting the collateral damage induced by endogenous lysosomal cysteine or serine peptidases. If this hypothesis is correct, then the loss of lysosomal integrity must be a common occurrence during cellular stress. However, the role of lysosomes in cellular injury is uncertain. Initially considered “suicide bags” that provoked programmed cell death and tissue involution, the inability to show a causal relationship between lysosomal fragility and cell death led to the supposition that lysosmes were durable structures, which released their powerful complement of acid hydrolases into the cytosol only during postmortem autolysis (de Duve, 1983de Duve C. Lysosomes revisited.Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Subsequently, caspase-dependent apoptosis (type I death) was considered the predominant form of programmed cell death with lysosomes relegated to an injurious role only in cases where autophagy precipitated injury (type II death) (Clarke, 1990Clarke P.G. Developmental cell death: morphological diversity and multiple mechanisms.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1990; 181: 195-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). More recently, lysosomes were implicated, albeit marginally, in the induction or execution of the three major cell death routines, including necrosis (type III death) (Golstein and Kroemer, 2007Golstein P. Kroemer G. Cell death by necrosis: towards a molecular definition.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, Zong and Thompson, 2006Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Necrotic death as a cell fate.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Indeed, studies suggest that increasing lysosomal membrane permeability by exposure to oxygen-free radicals, photo-oxidation products, or calpains shifts the cell death routine from apoptosis (ordered and programmed) to necrosis (unordered and unprogrammed) (Golstein and Kroemer, 2007Golstein P. Kroemer G. Cell death by necrosis: towards a molecular definition.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 37-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, Zong and Thompson, 2006Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Necrotic death as a cell fate.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Since there is little data suggesting that eukaryotic serpinsIC protect against caspase-dependent apoptosis (Silverman et al., 2004Silverman G.A. Whisstock J.C. Askew D.J. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Irving J.A. Bird P.I. Human clade B serpins (ov-serpins) belong to a cohort of evolutionarily-dispersed intracellular proteinase inhibitor clades that protect cells from promiscuous proteolysis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 301-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), these inhibitors may play a role by preventing lysosomal peptidases from exacerbating caspase-independent apoptosis or necrosis. Experimental support for this hypothesis, in vivo, has yet to come from targeted deletions of serpinsIC in mice. Although Serpinb9 nulls show increased loss of cytotoxic lymphocytes, Serpinb2 or -b6 nulls show normal development, survival, fertility, wound healing, and resistance to infection (Dougherty et al., 1999Dougherty K.M. Pearson J.M. Yang A.Y. Westrick R.J. Baker M.S. Ginsburg D. The plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 gene is not required for normal murine development or survival.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Serine protease inhibitor 6 protects cytotoxic T cells from self-inflicted injury by ensuring the integrity of cytotoxic granules.Immunity. 2006; 24: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expansion of the serpinIC cluster to 28 genes in the mouse, as compared to 13 in humans, as well as functional overlaps between paralogs may confound this experimental approach (Silverman et al., 2004Silverman G.A. Whisstock J.C. Askew D.J. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Irving J.A. Bird P.I. Human clade B serpins (ov-serpins) belong to a cohort of evolutionarily-dispersed intracellular proteinase inhibitor clades that protect cells from promiscuous proteolysis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 301-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Members of the serpinIC family are also conserved in the genomes of simpler multicellular organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. This nematode harbors 9 serpinsIC of which 5 are bona fide peptidase inhibitors (Luke et al., 2006Luke C.J. Pak S.C. Askew D.J. Askew Y.S. Smith J.E. Silverman G.A. Selective conservation of the RSL-encoding, proteinase inhibitory-type, clade l serpins in Caenorhabditis species.Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether a reverse genetic approach in a model organism with a smaller serpinIC repertoire could yield insight into the biologic function of this evolutionarily well-conserved, yet enigmatic family of proteins. We identified a surprisingly virulent necrotic phenotype (Osl) in animals (srp-6(ok319)) with homozygous loss of the inhibitory-type serpinIC, srp-6. Interestingly SRP-6 protected animals from necrosis by blocking calpain-associated lysosomal lysis and by neutralizing lysosomal cysteine peptidases released from injured organelles. In addition, SRP-6 protected against necrosis induced by heat stress, hypoxia hyperoxia, and cation channel hyperactivity. Taken together, these studies showed that massive cellular necrosis was neither unregulated nor unprogrammed but was triggered by an ordered, SRP-6-regulated, peptidase-driven stress response pathway targeting the lysosomal compartment. Thus, serpinsIC may serve as prosurvival factors by protecting against both the induction and sequelae of lysosomal injury. An interstitial deletion encompassing the reactive site loop (RSL) and 85% of the srp-6 coding region occurred in srp-6(ok319) animals (Supplemental Results; Figure S1). srp-6 nulls were similar to wild-type Bristol N2 (srp-6(+)) animals in terms of anatomy, pharyngeal pumping, life span, fecundity, and movement (not shown). At 20°C–25°C, however, the survival of the srp-6(ok319) animals was decreased markedly when they were collected in water rather than isotonic M9 buffer (Figure 1A). DIC microscopy showed that the srp-6(ok319) animals had suffered a grim fate (Figures 1B–1K). srp-6(ok319) larvae thrashed about for a few minutes and became rod-like with multiple vacuoles and refractile cell corpses (Figures 1D–1K; Movies S1A and S1B). Animals were unresponsive to light touch and never recovered movement upon transfer to NGM growth plates. Adult animals shared a similar fate and frequently extruded their uteri and intestines through the vulval opening or anus after one or two jack-knife-like contractions (Figures 1B and 1C; Movies S2A and S2B). Typically, the median survival of srp-6(ok319) animals was ∼1 min (Figure 1A), whereas >90% of the srp-6(+) animals were alive after 30 min, and most were viable after immersion for ∼24 hr (not shown). Intestinal cells of srp-6(ok319) animals lost membrane integrity within ∼60 s of water immersion as shown by uptake of propidium iodide (Figures 1L–1Q). Consistent with the site of injury, a srp-6::GFP transgene showed expression within intestinal cells (Figure S2). Death did not occur by drowning as srp-6(ok319) animals died rapidly upon transfer to 2% agarose pads prepared with water. The phenotype of srp-6(ok319) animals in water, which was designated hypo-osmotic stress lethal (Osl) by the C. elegans nomenclature committee (http://biosci.umn.edu/CGC/Nomenclature/genes.htm), was autosomal recessive (data not shown). A second srp-6 deletion mutant, srp-6(tm1994), also was Osl (data not shown). Of note, animals with enhanced fibroblast growth factor signaling amassed fluid in their pseudocoelomic space under isotonic conditions (Kokel et al., 1998Kokel M. Borland C.Z. DeLong L. Horvitz H.R. Stern M.J. clr-1 encodes a receptor tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates an FGF receptor signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1425-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Under normal growth conditions, this Clear (Clr) phenotype was distinct morphologically from that of Osl. Moreover clr-1(e1745) mutants, unlike srp-6(ok319) animals with the Osl phenotype, survived when placed in water (not shown). The secretory-excretory system, which consists of the excretory, gland, duct, and pore cells, is responsible for osmoregulation in C. elegans (Nelson and Riddle, 1984Nelson F.K. Riddle D.L. Functional study of the Caenorhabditis elegans secretory-excretory system using laser microsurgery.J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 231: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). srp-6(ok319) animals expressing a clh-4::GFP transgene showed an apparently normal excretory system (Figure S3). More importantly, srp-6(RNAi) phenocopied Osl at a time when C. elegans development was complete (Figure S4). We concluded that Osl was due to a physiological rather than an anatomical defect. In response to hypotonic shock, cells undergo a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) to restore cell volume and osmolality (Jakab et al., 2002Jakab M. Furst J. Gschwentner M. Botta G. Garavaglia M.L. Bazzini C. Rodighiero S. Meyer G. Eichmueller S. Woll E. et al.Mechanisms sensing and modulating signals arising from cell swelling.Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 12: 235-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). RVD involves a rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) followed by an efflux of inorganic ions, organic osmolytes, and water. In C. elegans, changes in cellular size and [Ca2+]i can be assessed by approximating the volume of the intact organism and by measuring cytoplasmic fluorescence with the calcium indicator, Fluo-4, respectively (Lamitina and Strange, 2005Lamitina S.T. Strange K. Transcriptional targets of DAF-16 insulin signaling pathway protect C. elegans from extreme hypertonic stress.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C467-C474Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both srp-6(ok319) and srp-6(+) animals showed a comparable increase in volume and [Ca2+]i minutes after hypotonic shock at 25°C (Figures 2A and 2C). However, the [Ca2+]i of srp-6(ok319) animals did not return to baseline and volume never decreased. We concluded that mutant animals were either RVD defective or that RVD was normal but could not be completed due to the concomitant activation of a cell death routine. We noticed that srp-6(ok319) animals exposed to water at 10°C were protected from death. Since this temperature does not appreciably alter water influx and cell swelling, we repeated the experiments at this temperature. Both srp-6(+) and srp-6(ok319) animals demonstrated a comparable increase and subsequent decrease in both cell volume and [Ca2+]i (Figures 2B and 2D). These findings suggested (1) srp-6(ok319) animals could undergo an RVD, (2) cell swelling and the increased turgor pressure per se did not kill the animals, and (3) hypotonic shock triggered a temperature-sensitive, SRP-6-regulated cell death routine. In C. elegans, apoptosis occurs in embryonic and larval development and typically involves the caspase, CED-3, which is regulated by pro-apoptotic (CED-4, EGL-1) and anti-apoptotic (CED-9) factors (Lettre and Hengartner, 2006Lettre G. Hengartner M.O. Developmental apoptosis in C. elegans: a complex CEDnario.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, neither the ced-3(n717), ced-4(n1162), nor ced-9(1950) mutation suppressed srp-6(RNAi)-induced Osl (Figure 3A). Also, the caspase inhibitors DEVD-CHO or YVAD-CHO could not block Osl (Figure 3B). In C. elegans, genes associated with the autophagic pathway are critical for normal dauer diapause (an adaptive stress response) but have not yet been linked to cell death (Melendez et al., 2003Melendez A. Talloczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Autophagy genes are essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans.Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). srp-6(ok319) animals exposed to bec-1(RNAi) (orthologous to yeast APG6) showed no increase in survival (Figure 3C) but did show abnormal dauer formation (data not shown). Necrotic cell death has been described in C. elegans (Driscoll and Gerstbrein, 2003Driscoll M. Gerstbrein B. Dying for a cause: invertebrate genetics takes on human neurodegeneration.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This necrotic or degenerin pathway mimics that associated with excitotoxic injury and occurs in neurons expressing gain-of-function mutations in degenerin/epithelial Na+ channels (deg-1, mec-4, mec-10, unc-8, and unc-105), a GTP-binding protein subunit (gsa-1, a Gαs), and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (deg-3) (Berger et al., 1998Berger A.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 17: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of ion channels in C. elegans leads to a rise in [Ca2+]i, and necrosis can be suppressed by mutations that block the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Xu et al., 2001Xu K. Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Necrotic cell death in C. elegans requires the function of calreticulin and regulators of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum.Neuron. 2001; 31: 957-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We performed srp-6(RNAi) on animals lacking the ryanodine (RyR/unc-68(kh30)) or inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3R/itr-1(sa73)) receptor. These receptor mutants and null or loss-of-function mutations of the ER Ca2+-binding protein, calreticulin (crt-1(bz31)), significantly suppressed death induced by srp-6(RNAi) (Figure 3D). Similarly, srp-6(ok319) animals treated with an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, EGTA-AM or BAPTA-AM, were protected from death (Figure S5A). srp-6(ok319) animals were not more sensitive to elevations in [Ca2+]i, as treatment with thapsigargin did not induce cell death despite a rate of rise in [Ca2+]i comparable to that observed with Osl (not shown). These data suggested that the rise in [Ca2+]i associated with a normal RVD was required, but not sufficient, to activate Osl. Aspartic (asp-3 and asp-4) and cysteine (calpains, clp-1, and tra-3/clp-5) peptidases are involved in the degenerin pathway (Syntichaki et al., 2002Syntichaki P. Xu K. Driscoll M. Tavernarakis N. Specific aspartyl and calpain proteases are required for neurodegeneration in C. elegans.Nature. 2002; 419: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Interestingly, asp-1(RNAi), which is expressed predominantly in the lysosomes and brush border of intestinal cells (Tcherepanova et al., 2000Tcherepanova I. Bhattacharyya L. Rubin C.S. Freedman J.H. Aspartic proteases from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Structural organization and developmental and cell-specific expression of asp-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26359-26369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and to a lesser extent asp-3(RNAi), but not asp-4(RNAi), protected srp-6(ok319) animals from Osl (Figure 3E). Inhibition of calpains by tra-3/clp-5(RNAi) or W05G11.4(RNAi), but not clp-1(RNAi), also showed protection (Figure 3F). The C. elegans genome harbors at least 31 lysosomal cysteine peptidases and several are expressed in intestinal cells. RNAi with cpl-1 (catL-like) and cpr-6 (catB-like) protected srp-6(ok319) animals from death (Figure 3G). Consistent with the RNAi studies, pre-treatment of srp-6(ok319) animals with the papain-like cysteine peptidase inhibitor, E-64d, protected against Osl (Figure 3B). Although E-64d protected against death, this treatment did not block the Osl-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that Ca2+ release occurred upstream of cysteine peptidase activation (Figure S5B). Taken together, these studies suggested that necrosis was the manner of death in Osl. Since Osl was partially dependent upon cysteine peptidases, we determined whether SRP-6 might serve as their inhibitor. Like human SERPINB3, recombinant SRP-6 inhibited papain-like lysosomal cysteine peptidases (clan CA, family C1) such as catL and catK, but not any of the serine peptidases within a broad array of purified enzymes (Table S1). Interestingly, SRP-6 also inhibited calpain-2 (clan CA, family C2). The inhibition of these enzymes was characteristic of serpin-target peptidase interactions as shown by typical stoichiometries of inhibition (SI) (Figures 4A and 4B), second-order rate constants (Figures 4C and 4D), covalent complex formation (Figures 4E and 4F), and peptidase-mediated RSL cleavages (Figure 4G). To confirm that the loss of cysteine peptidase inhibitory activity of SRP-6 was the cause of Osl, we performed transgenic rescue experiments of srp-6(ok319) animals using a srp-6 gene with either a wild-type or mutated RSL. The mutations were placed at the P14 hinge region (T337R) or the reactive center P1 and P2 residues (L339A;T340A). The classical P14 mutation blocks covalent complex formation with any target peptidase. The P2 and P1 mutations block papain-like lysosomal cysteine peptidase binding, as these enzymes prefer hydrophobic residues at the P2 position and bind cooperatively to residues at the P1 position (Schick et al., 1998Schick C. Bromme D. Bartuski A.J. Uemura Y. Schechter N.M. Silverman G.A. The reactive site loop of the serpin SCCA1 is essential for cysteine proteinase inhibition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 13465-13470Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each of these constructs was coinjected with a Pnhx-2::GFP reporter plasmid (the nhx-2 promoter drives expression exclusively within intestinal cells; Nehrke, 2003Nehrke K. A reduction in intestinal cell pHi due to loss of the Caenorhabditis elegans Na+/H+ exchanger NHX-2 increases life span.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44657-44666Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) into the gonads of young adult srp-6(ok319) animals. Transgenic lines with the wild-type srp-6 gene (VK249) showed nearly complete suppression of Osl (Figure 4H). In contrast, srp-6(ok319) animals harboring the srp-6 transgene with either the P14 mutation (VK248) or the P2-P1 mutations (VK247) were still Osl (Figure 4I). To determine whether intestinal cell expression was sufficient to rescue srp-6(ok319) animals, we replaced the srp-6 promoter with that from nhx-2. The nhx-2-driven wild-type srp-6, but not the P14 mutant, also rescued srp-6 nulls (VK611 and VK618, Figures 3H and 3I, respectively). We concluded that the loss of intestinal cell SRP-6 cysteine peptidase inhibitory activity caused Osl. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the membranes of lysosomal-like gut granule membranes were disrupted several minutes after hypotonic shock (Figures 5A–5F). At this stage, most mitochondria and other cellular structures were still intact. To confirm that lysosomal instability and release of cathepsins was an early feature of Osl, confocal microscopy was used to follow the fate of gut granules labeled coincidently with the endocytic marker, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-dextran, and the general fluorescent cysteine peptidase substrate, (Z-FR)2-R110 (Figures 5G–5R). Dual labeling confirmed that the majority of gut granules appeared to be lysosomes containing endocytosed molecules and active cysteine peptidases. The labeled granules of only live srp-6(ok319) animals began to lyse minutes after hypotonic shock (Figures 5G–5R; Movies S3A and S3B, S4A and S4B, and S5A and S5B). Widefield fluorescence microscopy revealed that gut granule lysis was followed by a wave of intense cytoplasmic (Z-FR)2-R110 fluorescence, indicating the presence of diffuse cysteine peptidase activity prior to death (Figures 5S–5AD; Movies S6A and S6B). These studies showed that the disintegration of lysosomal-like gut granules and subsequent cytoplasmic cysteine peptidase activity were active components of the cell death routine and not a post-mortem event. To test this hypothesis, we generated srp-6(ok319);glo-1(zu437) double mutants. glo-1 is a Rab-like GTPase required for the biogenesis of acidic, lysosomal-like gut granules (Hermann et al., 2005Hermann G.J. Schroeder L.K. Hieb C.A. Kershner A.M. Rabbitts B.M. Fonarev P. Grant B.D. Priess J.R. Genetic analysis of lysosomal trafficking in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3273-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). glo-1(zu437) mutants lack these lysosomes and appear to direct their contents into the intestinal lumen. srp-6(ok319);glo-1(zu437) animals exposed to hypotonic shock were protected from death (Figure 3H). Consistent with these findings, the lysosomes of srp-6(ok319);tra-3(RNAi) (Figures 5AE–5AL) and EGTA-AM-treated srp-6(ok319) animals, two treatments that block Osl, remained intact after hypotonic shock (Figure S5C). Taken together, these data demonstrated that lysosomal-like gut granule instability was required for Osl. Since lysosomes did not lyse in srp-6(+) animals, we concluded that SRP-6 protected against lysosomal rupture. To determine whether SRP-6 also protected the cell after lysosomal disruption, we compared the survival of srp-6(ok319) to srp-6(+) animals after inducing direct lysosomal injury with acridine orange (AO). Lysosomes trap this weak basic dye and lyse upon exposure to blue light (Hiruma et al., 2007Hiruma H. Katakura T. Takenami T. Igawa S. Kanoh M. Fujimura T. Kawakami T. Vesicle disruption, plasma membrane bleb formation, and acute cell death caused by illumination with blue light in acridine orange-loaded malignant cells.J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2007; 86: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As expected, most of the gut granules from both animals lysed minutes after exposure to blue light (Figures 6A–6H). However, the srp-6(ok319) animals showed markedly increased intestinal cell vacuolization and mortality (Figure 6M). Surprisingly, when we examined the surviving srp-6(+) animals ∼30 min after treatment, their lysosomal compartment was reconstituted as shown by the reappearance of granular AO staining (Figures 6I–6L). These data showed that SRP-6 also protected the cell from injury after lysosomal rupture. To determine whether the protective role of SRP-6 was restricted to Osl or could be extended to other stressors, we compared the survival rate of srp-6(ok319) to srp-6(+) animals after exposure to heat-shock (Lithgow et al., 1995Lithgow G.J.

Bridgman P.C. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various biological phenomena, such as increased protein synthesis, nutrient deprivation, and alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis, hamper protein folding in the ER, causing unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER lumen. This condition is designated as ER stress, which triggers an adaptive reaction known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar, 3Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The protective signaling of the UPR acts transiently to maintain homeostasis within the ER, but sustained ER stress ultimately leads to apoptosis. Most of the previous studies on ER stress focused on its pathological aspect, as the pathogenesis of ischemic and neurodegenerative disorders is characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that the UPR is required for normal development for certain cell lineages and that Xbp1, a pivotal transcription factor of the UPR, is essential for liver development (4Reimold A.M. Etkin A. Clauss I. Perkins A. Friend D.S. Zhang J. Horton H.F. Scott A. Orkin S.H. Byrne M.C. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H.

Alt F. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 2001; 412: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Xbp1 is a basic leucine zipper type transcription factor; it is activated by spliceosome-independent mRNA splicing initiated by Ire1α on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane (6Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2982) Google Scholar). The endoribonuclease Ire1α cleaves a 26-nt fragment from an unspliced form of Xbp1 mRNA, inducing a frameshift of the open reading frame (ORF) of the message. Xbp1 protein translated from the unspliced mRNA (Xbp1u protein) has no transcriptional activity, whereas Xbp1 protein from the spliced mRNA (Xbp1s protein) is a potent transcription factor inducing expression of UPR-related genes. This type of transcription factor activation (the unconventional splicing of its mRNA in the cytoplasm not in the nucleus) is unique to Xbp1 in animals, and the mechanistic basis of Xbp1 splicing and its function has been studied intensively in non-neuronal cells (5Reimold A.M.

Although the mRNA of Xbp1 is expressed in the brains of adult rodents (10Paschen W. Yatsiv I. Shoham S. Shohami E. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), little is known about the detailed expression and function of Xbp1 in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In this study, by utilizing an isolated neurite culture system and time-lapse imaging, we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of Xbp1 during mouse CNS development and demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced the splicing of Xbp1 mRNA in the neurites, contributing to neurite outgrowth. Animals—The Xbp1 knock-out mice were kindly provided by Dr. L. H. Glimcher (Harvard School of Public Health, Cambridge, MA). The Animal Experiment Committee of RIKEN approved all experimental procedures. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) to Xbp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit pAb to eIF-2α, phospho-eIF-2α (Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada), mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to phospho-neurofilaments (Sternberger Monoclonal, Lutherville, MD), mouse mAb to MAP2 (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), mouse mAb to PSD-95 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), mAb to actin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and Alexa 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) were used. Mouse mAb to synaptophysin (11Obata K. Kojima N. Nishiye H. Inoue H. Shirao T. Fujita S.C. Uchizono K. Brain Res. 1987; 404: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Obata (Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Japan). Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was purchased from Invitrogen, BDNF was from Sigma-Aldrich, and rapamycin was from Calbiochem. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—Full-length cDNAs for mouse Xbp1u (unspliced form) and Xbp1s (spliced form) were obtained by RT-PCR from the total RNA of NIH3T3 cells. Generation of Xbp1ns (never spliced by Ire1α) by site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (7Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L. Rajewsky K. Glimcher L.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The resulting products were subcloned into pcDNA4/myc-His (Invitrogen) to create pcDNA/Xbp1s-His or pcDNA/Xbp1ns-His. A full-length Xbp1u cDNA was also inserted into the BamHI site of Venus/pCS2 vector (kindly provided by Dr. A. Miyawaki, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN) to create pCS2/Xbp1-Venus, in which the Venus cDNA was located at the downstream region of Xbp1u cDNA; Xbp1s-Venus fusion protein was translated only when Ire1α-dependent splicing occurred. Cultured cells were transfected with expression plasmids by the use of LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen). In standard analyses, neurons were transfected after 1 day in vitro (DIV) and maintained for 1-4 days after transfection. In Situ Hybridization (ISH)—Mouse brains were prepared by perfusion fixation, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 8-μm thick sections. The procedures were as previously described (12Sadakata T. Mizoguchi A. Sato Y. Katoh-Semba R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled antisense (or sense, as a negative control probe) RNA complementary to the coding region of the mouse full-length Xbp1 cDNA using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche, Mannheim Germany) with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase. After hybridization and washes, sections were incubated in a color-developing buffer containing NBT and BCIP for 8-12 h. Cell Cultures and Isolated Neurites—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and primary telencephalic neuronal cultures with Xbp1+/+ or Xbp1−/- genotype were generated from embryos at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) according to the methods described previously (13Kakiuchi C. Ishiwata M. Hayashi A. Kato T. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons were isolated from mouse embryos at gestational day 17-18 as described previously (14Ohnishi H. Kaneko Y. Okazawa H. Miyashita M. Sato R. Hayashi A. Tada K. Nagata S. Takahashi M. Matozaki T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 10: 2702-2711Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were plated on laminin- and poly-d-lysine-coated cover glasses or plastic culture dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 for high density culture or 1.3 × 104 cells/cm2 for low density culture. The hippocampal neurons were maintained in a serum-free medium (Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5 mm glutamine and B27 supplement (Invitrogen)). Isolated neurites were prepared according to the two surface culture techniques (15Torre E.R. Steward O. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 762-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Hippocampal neurons were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 into a culture insert containing a polycarbonate filter membrane with 3-μm-diameter pore (Chemotaxis 3 μ; Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) that had been coated with poly-d-lysine. After 5 days in culture in the serum-free medium, the upper membrane surface was scraped with a cotton swab (a thoroughly flattened tip) to remove cell bodies. Scraping was repeated three times with a fresh swab. The scraped membrane was analyzed by TO-PRO3 nuclear staining (Invitrogen) to ensure complete removal of cell bodies and non-neuronal cells. Only preparations containing no cell bodies were used for experiments. At 20 h after the removal of cell bodies, the isolated neurites remaining on the lower surface were stimulated with BDNF (100 ng/ml) or BDNF plus rapamycin (20 ng/ml). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissue or cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The SuperScript II first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. For isolated neurites, total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and was processed through the antisense RNA amplification (16Van Gelder R.N. von Zastrow M.E. Yool A. Dement W.C. Barchas J.D. Eberwine J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (100 ng) was first reverse-transcribed using a T7-oligo (dT) promoter primer (Affymetrix Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in the first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction. Following RNase H-mediated second-strand cDNA synthesis, the double-stranded cDNA was purified using a cRNA in vitro transcription (IVT) cleanup kit (Affymetrix) and served as a template in the subsequent IVT reaction. The IVT reaction was carried out in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), and then an additional procedure of double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) synthesis was performed to obtain a sufficient amount of cDNA for analysis. cDNAs were subjected to a TaqMan RT-PCR assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer sequences were as follows (nucleotide difference between Xbp1s and Xbp1u underlined): (sense) 5′-CTGAGTCCGCAGCAGGT-3′ (Xbp1s) 5′-CTGAGTCCGCAGCACTCAGA-3′ (Xbp1u); (antisense) 5′-TGTCAGAGTCCATGGGAAGA-3′ (Xbp1s) 5′-TCAGAGTCCATGGGAAGATGTTC-3′ (Xbp1u); (FAM-labeled probe): 5′-GGCCCAGTTGTCACCTCCCC-3′ (Xbp1s) and 5′-CTATGTGCACCTCTGC-3′ (Xbp1u). All of the other assays were carried out using the Assay-on-Demand service (Applied Biosystems). We calculated the relative values by measuring ΔCt = Ct (each gene) - Ct (Gapdh or Actb) for each sample in quadruplicate. For the assessment of a ratio of Xbp1s to Xbp1u mRNA (Xbp1s/u ratio), an external control standard curve was determined by a PCR with the serial dilution of pcDNA/Xbp1s or pcDNA/Xbp1u plasmid as template. These standard curves displayed a linear relationship between Ct values and the logarithm of the input plasmid amounts (supplemental Fig. S2). To validate the Xbp1 isoform specificity of each probe, we performed quantitative PCR with the Xbp1s plasmid template and Xbp1u-specific probe or with the Xbp1u plasmid template and Xbp1s-specific probe. Although PCR efficiency of the undesirable cross-reaction was less than 2% relative to the specific reaction, the contribution of the cross-reaction was subtracted from the absolute value estimated by the specific reaction. Each value was compared statistically with the control by a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Games-Howell multiple comparison test. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml bromphenol blue). The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using standard procedures. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Neurons or isolated neurites were fixed for 20-30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature in a blocking solution (PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100). They were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with corresponding Alexa 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution, washed again with PBS, and mounted. For quantitative fluorescence analysis, low density cultured hippocampal neurons were fixed and stained with pAb to phospho-eIF2α and MAP2. Images were acquired with a ×40 objective lens (N.A. = 1.00) of a confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) in 35 randomly selected fields from each independent culture preparation. The integration of fluorescence intensity was measured using Fluoview imaging software (Olympus). The background intensity (based on a neighboring region that did not contain neurons) was subtracted from each value obtained. Because MAP2 is widely distributed throughout the early developing neuron, a ratio of phospho-eIF2α to MAP2 fluorescence signals was regarded as the phospho-eIF2α level in the neurons. Time-lapse Imaging—Neurons were kept in a humidified incubator (MI-IBC-IF, Olympus) at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and they were imaged every 5 min for 12 h with a ×60 objective lens (N.A. = 1.40) of a confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus) with an argon laser (3% intensity) adjusted to a wavelength of 515 nm. For the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay, a region of interest (ROI) in the nucleus was scanned with the 515-nm laser (100% intensity) for 10 s to photobleach the fluorescence of Venus, and postbleach images were captured as well. Quantitative Morphological Analysis—Low density cultured neurons derived from E12.5 telencephalons of Xbp1+/+ or Xbp1−/- mice at 4 DIV were fixed and stained with Ab to pNF, an axonal marker, and rhodamine phalloidin. The length of axons, which were at least twice as long as the cell body, was measured in 150 randomly selected neurons with large pyramidal morphologies. The length was calculated with Scion image software (Frederick, MD). Three independent analyses were carried out while blinded to Xbp1 genotype. Nonparametric statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U test and a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) were used to compare the distributions of values in two data sets. Xbp1 Is Highly Expressed in the Developing CNS—It has been reported that Xbp1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in the mouse embryo, and especially strongly in the exocrine glands, liver, and bone precursors (17Clauss I.M. Gravallese E.M. Darling J.M. Shapiro F. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although Xbp1 is also expressed in the brains of adult rodents (10Paschen W. Yatsiv I. Shoham S. Shohami E. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the regional, and developmental variability of Xbp1 expression in the CNS has not been well characterized. We examined the expression profile of Xbp1 mRNA during mouse CNS development. Mice ranging in age from E18 to postnatal day 300 (P300) were subjected to ISH with a riboprobe that hybridized to both Xbp1s and Xbp1u mRNAs. At E18, Xbp1 was expressed throughout the brain. After birth, it was preferentially present in the regions with abundant neuronal cell bodies, namely the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, thalamic nuclei, striatum, and cerebellum in postnatal development (Fig. 1A). Hippocampus was most strongly labeled throughout the various developmental stages (Fig. 1B). The pyramidal neurons of the frontal cortex and hippocampal cornu ammonis area 3 were intensely labeled with the Xbp1 probe at the early postnatal period (P7), but the signal seemed to be weaker at the adult stage (P300; Fig. 1C). In particular, apical dendrites of the pyramidal neurons were labeled with the Xbp1 probe during the early postnatal period. Xbp1 sense control probe gave no specific hybridization signal (supplemental Fig. S1A). To characterize the subcellular localization of Xbp1 mRNA, cultured hippocampal neurons at 4 and 10 DIV were subjected to ISH. Xbp1 mRNA was abundant in the cell body, and it was also present in neurites and growth cones (Fig. 1D). No hybridization signal was observed in either soma or neurites with Xbp1 sense control probe (supplemental Fig. S1B). We performed a real-time RT-PCR assay to compare quantitatively Xbp1 mRNA expression in brain samples from different stages. To distinguish between Xbp1s and Xbp1u mRNAs, we designed Xbp1s- and Xbp1u-specific TaqMan probe sets (supplemental Fig. S2). Consistent with the findings of ISH with a riboprobe that hybridized to both Xbp1s and Xbp1u mRNAs (Fig. 1), total Xbp1 (Xbp1t) was highly expressed during early postnatal developing stages in comparison with the developed stage P360 (Fig. 2D). While Xbp1u mRNA has a similar expression profile to that of Xbp1t (Fig. 2B), Xbp1s was abundant through both the prenatal and early postnatal period (Fig. 2A). We quantified the splicing efficiency of Xbp1 mRNA, the ratio of Xbp1s mRNA to Xbp1u (Xbp1s/u ratio; see also supplemental Fig. S2). Xbp1s/u ratio was larger in the developing period E12 compared with the developed period P360 (Fig. 2C). Grp78, an ER chaperone up-regulated during the UPR, was also highly expressed in developing stages (Fig. 2E). Subcellular Localization of Xbp1 Protein in Hippocampal Neurons—The localization of Xbp1 protein in various developmental stages of mouse cultured hippocampal neurons was examined by immunofluorescence analysis with pAb to Xbp1, which did not distinguish between Xbp1s and Xbp1u proteins. The specificity of pAb to Xbp1 protein was verified using mouse embryonic fibroblasts with Xbp1−/- genotype as a negative control (supplemental Fig. S3). While Xbp1-like immunoreactivity (Xbp1-IR) was strongly detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus at 4 DIV, less immunoreactivity was seen at a later stage (18 DIV), especially in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). To investigate the Xbp1 protein expression profile, total cell lysates prepared from cultured hippocampal neurons of several developmental stages were subjected to immunoblot analysis. A relatively high level of 54-kDa Xbp1s protein was seen at the developing stage (4-10 DIV) compared with the developed stage (18-26 DIV; Fig. 3B). In contrast, we failed to detect 33-kDa Xbp1u protein, possibly because of the shorter half-life of Xbp1u protein than that of Xbp1s protein (18Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). Indeed, we could see both Xbp1s and Xbp1u clearly in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that blocks Xbp1 degradation (supplemental Fig. S3). We next examined the detailed subcellular localization of Xbp1 protein by costaining with neuronal markers at various stages. At 6 DIV, Xbp1-IR was present at relatively high levels in the soma, and it was detected along axons stained with mAb to phosphorylated neurofilaments (pNF), an axonal marker (open arrows). Growth cones, as well as the soma, exhibited high Xbp1-IR (Fig. 3C, arrowheads). Xbp1 was also detected in the dendrites stained with MAP2 (solid arrows). These results suggest that Xbp1 protein localizes not only to the soma but also to axons, dendrites, and growth cones of developing hippocampal neurons. To distinguish clearly the distribution of Xbp1s and Xbp1u proteins in the neurons, we generated two expression constructs. In the first construct, the 26-nt sequence was already spliced out of Xbp1 cDNA; thus, it produced only Xbp1s protein. The second one contained mutant Xbp1 cDNA, which produced mRNA that was resistant to splicing by Ire1α (7Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L. Rajewsky K. Glimcher L.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and produced only Xbp1u protein. Each cDNA was fused with a His tag sequence and named His-Xbp1s or His-Xbp1ns (never spliced), respectively. Expression of the His tag proteins was tested by immunoblot analysis to ensure that each expression construct produced the correct molecular weight, 54-kDa or 33-kDa, respectively (Fig. 3D). Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with His-Xbp1s or His-Xbp1ns construct, and the cells were immunostained with mAb to His and MAP2 (Fig. 3D). His-Xbp1u protein expressed from the His-Xbp1ns construct was distributed in the cytoplasm, including dendrites, except for the nucleus. On the other hand, His-Xbp1s protein was concentrated in the nucleus, suggesting differential subcellular localizations of Xbp1s and Xbp1u proteins. The ratio of fluorescence intensity between the nucleus and cytoplasm in the cultured hippocampal neurons was analyzed to confirm the differential localization of Xbp1s and Xbp1u. Xbp1s exhibited a nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio of 3.59, whereas Xbp1ns had a ratio of 0.39, the difference of which was statistically significant (Fig. 3D). The same staining pattern of Xbp1s and Xbp1u proteins was also observed in NIH3T3 cells (supplemental Fig. S4) and HeLa cells (43Yoshida H. Oku M. Suzuki M. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The differential subcellular localizations of Xbp1s and Xbp1u proteins might be generally shown in various regional and developmental cell lines. Xbp1 mRNA Is Spliced in Neurites in Response to BDNF—The highly polarized neurons have a characteristic protein synthesis mechanism, local protein synthesis, which is characterized by regulated mRNA localization and local translation in the neurites. This is the well-documented mechanism that provides the neurons with a means of rapidly altering protein composition in a spatially restricted manner, and it is known to play central roles in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity (19Martin K.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). BDNF strongly enhances protein synthesis by promoting translation initiation in neurons (20Takei N. Kawamura M. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42818-42825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because ER stress is often accompanied by increased protein synthesis (21Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar), we investigated whether BDNF triggers the UPR and induces Xbp1 splicing in mouse hippocampal neurons. RT-PCR revealed that bath application of BDNF (100 ng/ml) strikingly increased the splicing of Xbp1 mRNA within 8 h of stimulation (Fig. 4A). The Xbp1s/u ratio was dramatically increased in response to BDNF. Rapamycin, which suppresses BDNF-dependent protein synthesis (22Schratt G.M. Nigh E.A. Chen W.G. Hu L. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7366-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), significantly blocked the Xbp1 mRNA splicing. As Xbp1 mRNA (Xbp1u and Xbp1s) was detected throughout developing neurons (Fig. 1, C and D), we next asked where the splicing event occurs in neurites. For this purpose, we used a two surface culture technique (15Torre E.R. Steward O. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 762-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by which we isolated neurites on the lower surface of a membrane apart from their cell bodies on the upper surface (see “Experimental Procedures”). The removal of neuronal cell bodies was verified by microscopic investigation (supplemental Fig. S5A). Low ratio of γ-actin to β-actin mRNA level in the isolated neurites also supported the validity of the neurites preparation (supplemental Fig. S5B), because β-actin mRNA is frequently localized in growth cones, and γ-actin mRNA is confined to cell bodies in neurons (23Bassell G.J. Zhang H. Byrd A.L. Femino A.M. Singer R.H. Taneja K.L. Lifshitz L.M. Herman I.M. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 251-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zheng J.Q. Kelly T.K. Chang B. Ryazantsev S. Rajasekaran A.K. Martin K.C. Twiss J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9291-9303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 20 h after the removal of cell bodies, the isolated neurites remaining on the lower surface were stimulated with BDNF (100 ng/ml) or BDNF plus rapamycin (20 ng/ml) for quantitative RT-PCR. In isolated neurites, BDNF dramatically induced splicing of Xbp1 mRNA within 8 h of stimulation, and rapamycin significantly blocked this event (Fig. 4B). This assay provided good evidence that Xbp1 splicing occurred in neurites in response to BDNF. BDNF Also Activates eIF-2α Signaling Pathway in Cultured Neuron—Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α) is a well-documented mechanism of down-regulating protein synthesis under a variety of stress conditions. During ER stress, ER stress-mediated eIF-2α phosphorylation is carried out by PERK (21Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar), an ER-resident kinase functioning as an ER stress sensor protein, which is a parallel UPR pathway yet distinct to Ire1α-Xbp1 signaling. We tried to ascertain whether BDNF also activates eIF-2α signaling. Cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with BDNF or vehicle, followed by immunoblot or immunofluorescence analysis. Immunoblot analysis with pAb to phospho-eIF-2α revealed enhanced phosphorylation of eIF-2α in response to BDNF (Fig. 5A). Phosphorylation of eIF-2α was also detected in its mobility shift in immunoblot with pAb to eIF-2α. This was supported statistically by quantitative immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 5C). Phospho-eIF-2α was distributed not only in soma but also in neurites, suggesting that UPR signaling could indeed be triggered in neurites (Fig. 5B). Spliced Form of Xbp1 Is Translated in the Neurites and Is Transported into the Nucleus—To visualize the splicing of Xbp1u into Xbp1s mRNA, translation of Xbp1s mRNA, and localization of Xbp1s protein in cultured neurons spatiotemporally, we generated a construct consisting of the full-length mouse Xbp1u cDNA fused with Venus (a variant of yellow fluorescent protein with fast maturation) (25Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotech. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar) in the frame of Xbp1s (Fig. 6A). Under an unstressed condition, the mRNA transcribed from the construct was not spliced, and only Xbp1u protein was produced. In contrast, during ER stress, the 26-nt fragment was spliced out by endogenous Ire1α, leading to a frameshift to induce translation of Xbp1s-Venus fusion protein (Fig. 6B, arrowhead). The hippocampal neurons were transfected with the Xbp1-Venus construct and bath-applied with BDNF. BDNF increased expression of both exogenous Xbp1s-Venus fusion protein and endogenous Xbp1s protein, corresponding to 80- or 54-kDa, respectively, which was determined by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against both Xbp1 and Venus (Fig. 6C). Neurons transfected with Xbp1-Venus construct were also imaged by confocal microscopy. The time-lapse imaging revea"

In previous studies on the stimulatory effect of GIP on adipocyte lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a pathway was identified involving increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) and reduced phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The slow time of onset of the responses suggested that GIP may have induced release of an intermediary molecule, and the current studies focused on the possible contribution of the adipokine resistin. In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GIP, in the presence of insulin, increased resistin secretion through a pathway involving p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and the stress-activated protein kinase/Jun amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). The other major incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), exhibited no significant effects. Chronic elevation of circulating GIP levels in the Vancouver Diabetic Fatty (VDF) Zucker rat resulted in increases in circulating resistin levels and activation of p38 MAPK or SAPK/JNK in epididymal fat tissue, suggesting the existence of identical pathways in vivo as well as in vitro. Administration of resistin to 3T3-L1 adipocytes mimicked the effects of GIP on the PKB/LKB1/AMPK/LPL pathway: increasing phosphorylation of PKB, reducing levels of phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPK, and increasing LPL activity.

As a result of the recent introduction of the GLP-1 agonist Exenatide and inhibitors of the incretin-degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV as therapeutics for type 2 diabetes (14Drucker D.J. Nauck M.A. Lancet. 2006; 368: 1696-1705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar), considerable interest has developed in the non-β-cell effects of the incretins. There is strong evidence that GIP plays an important regulatory role in fat metabolism (7Yip R.G. Boylan M.O. Kieffer T.J. Wolfe M.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4004-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8McIntosh C.H.S. Bremsak I. Lynn F.C. Gill R. Hinke S.A. Gelling R. McKnight G. Jaspers S. Pederson R.A.

During a meal, GIP is secreted in response to long chain fatty acids released from triglycerides (TGs) (16Brown J.C. Buchan A.M. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. Schultz S.G. Makhlouf G.M. Rauner B.B.

Raven Press, New York1993: 217-259Google Scholar). GIP promotes the clearance of chylomicron-associated TG from blood (18Wasada T. McCorkle K. Harris V. Kawai K. Howard B. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 68: 1106-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and infusion of GIP lowers rat plasma TG responses to intraduodenal fat (19Ohneda A. Kobayashi T. Nihei J. Regul. Pept. 1984; 8: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A direct adipogenic role was suggested by the demonstrations of GIP enhancement of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis from acetate (20Oben J. Morgan L. Fletcher J. Marks V. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 130: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and its incorporation into triglyceride (21Beck B. Max J.P. Regul. Pept. 1983; 7: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of these effects was emphasized by the finding that GIPR knock-out mice demonstrated reduced adipose tissue accretion on feeding a high-fat diet (22Miyawaki K. Yamada Y. Ban N. Ihara Y. Tsukiyama K. Zhou H. Fujimoto S. Oku A. Tsuda K. Toyokuni S. Hiau H. Mizunoya W. Fushiki T. Holst J.J. Makino M. Tashita A. Kobara Y. Tsubamoto Y. Jinnouchi T. Jomori T. Seino Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In an earlier study we demonstrated that GIP increased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and TG accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells and human subcutaneous adipocytes through a pathway involving increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) and decreases in LKB1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation (23Kim S.J. Nian C. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8557-8567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). An anomaly of these studies was the slow time of onset of the responses, suggesting that GIP may have acted through release of an intermediary molecule. Recently, Hansotia and co-workers (24Hansotia T. Maida A. Flock G. Yamada Y. Tsukiyama K. Seino Y. Drucker D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) administered the long acting GIPR agonist, [d-Ala2]GIP, to mice and observed an increase in plasma resistin that was absent in GIPR null mice and was not mimicked by the longacting GLP-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4. We have now examined the possibility that specific actions of GIP are mediated through the direct regulation of resistin release at the level of the adipocyte, resulting in activation of PKB and increased LPL activity. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in 25 mm glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin G-sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. INS-1 cells (clone 832/13) were kindly provided by Dr. C. B. Newgard (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). INS-1 (832/13) cells were cultured in 11 mm glucose RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin G-sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into the adipocyte phenotype as described previously (8McIntosh C.H.S. Bremsak I. Lynn F.C. Gill R. Hinke S.A. Gelling R. McKnight G. Jaspers S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 days after cells were confluent, medium was supplemented with dexamethasone (0.6 μm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 mm), and insulin (16 μm) for 72 h, after which cells were cultured in 25 mm glucose DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum for 7 further days. Differentiation of cells was confirmed by Oil Red-O staining and fully differentiated cells (>85% adipose cells) from passages 2 to 6 were used in all experiments. Resistin ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay)—For studies on the effect of GIP or GLP-1 on the secretion of resistin, INS-1 β-cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with GIP or GLP-1 as indicated in the figure legends. The levels of resistin in the media were determined using a Resistin ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted and cDNAs generated by reverse transcription. 100 ng of cDNA were used in the real-time PCR to measure resistin expression, whereas 10 ng of cDNA were used for the β-actin internal control. The primer and probe sequences used for the amplification of resistin cDNA are as follows: forward primer, 5′-AACCTTTCATTTCCCCTCCTTTTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGAAGCGACCTGCAGCTTACAGCA-3′; probe, 5′-FAM-AGTCTCCTCCAGAGGGAAGTTGG-3′ TAMRA. All reactions followed the typical sigmoidal reaction profile, and cycle threshold was used as a measurement of amplicon abundance. Western Blot Analysis—For studies on the effect of GIP or GLP-1 on intracellular resistin and protein kinase levels, INS-1 β-cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with GIP or GLP-1, as indicated in the figure legends. Total cellular extracts from each sample were separated on a 13% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Probing of the membranes was performed with resistin (ProSci Inc., Poway, CA), phospho-p38 MAP kinase (threonine 180/tyrosine 182), p38 MAP kinase, phospho-p42/44 MAP kinase (threonine 202/tyrosine 204), p42/44 MAP kinase, phospho-SAPK/JNK (threonine 183/tyrosine 185), phospho-PKB (serine 473), PKB, phospho-LKB1 (serine 428), and phospho-AMPK (threonine 172), AMPK and β-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies. LPL Enzyme Activity Assays—The LPL activity assay kit (Roar Biomedical Inc., New York) was used to measure enzyme activity, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Enzyme activity is presented as relative activity normalized to protein concentration. Knockdown of Resistin by RNA Interference—To reduce the synthesis and secretion of resistin, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with a pool of 3 siRNAs for resistin (sc-39723, Santa Cruz) using Lipofectamine 2000™ transfection reagent, and incubated for 72 h. The down-regulation of resistin protein by RNA interference was confirmed by Western blot hybridization using antibody against resistin. In Vivo GIP Infusion and Measurements of Circulating Resistin Levels—Obese VDF rats and their lean littermate (12 weeks old) were subjected to a 2-week continuous infusion of GIP (10 pmol/kg min). The infusion was performed using an Alzet miniosmotic pump (Alzet Corp., Minneapolis, MN) implanted in the intraperitoneal region under pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) anesthesia. For the controls, phosphate-buffered saline vehicle-containing minipumps were implanted. Blood samples were taken at the indicated time points, and circulating plasma resistin levels were determined. Experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines of the UBC Animal Care Committee and Canadian Council on Animal Care. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin sections containing epididymal fat tissue were prepared from GIP-treated and control rats and subjected to immunostaining for resistin. The sections were visualized with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody, and imaged using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (Axioskop2). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. with the number of individual experiments presented in the figure legends. Data were analyzed using the non-linear regression analysis program PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and significance was tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls hoc test (p < 0.05) as indicated in the figure legends. GIP, but Not GLP-1 Increases the Secretion of Resistin by 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The effect of GIP and GLP-1 on the secretion of resistin in vitro was first examined in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GIP (100 nm) in the presence of insulin (1 nm) for 2 h resulted in ∼2.3-fold increases in resistin secretion, compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). Concentration-dependent effects of GIP on resistin secretion were observed with EC50 values of 9.6 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 1B). In contrast, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GLP-1 (100 nm) had no effect on resistin secretion. Additionally, although resistin was detectable in extracts from INS-1 (832/13) β-cells, neither GIP nor GLP-1 affected secretion (Fig. 1, A and B). GIP Increases Resistin (Retn) mRNA Expression in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (supplementary Fig. S1) or INS-1 β-cells (supplementary Fig. S2) with GIP or GLP-1 (100 nm) was not found to alter resistin protein levels. One possible explanation for the lack of change in cell protein levels is that increases in expression only maintain sufficient newly synthesized resistin to support the increased secretion rate, without intracellular accumulation. To investigate this possibility, Retn mRNA levels were determined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes under basal and stimulated conditions. As shown in Fig. 1C, GIP in the presence of insulin, increased Retn mRNA levels, whereas GLP-1 had no effect. It is therefore likely that GIP-potentiated resistin secretion resulted from increased expression. GIP Increases Phosphorylation of p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182)) and Stress-activated Protein Kinase/Jun Amino-terminal Kinase (SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185)) in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Signaling modules potentially involved in GIP-mediated resistin secretion were next studied. Because resistin secretion was evident within 1 h following GIP treatment, we first examined faster acting MAPK signaling modules, including p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK. There was no significant effect of GIP or GLP-1 on the levels of phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during the time course of the study (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, GIP, in the presence of insulin, was found to increase phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) transiently, peaking at 5–10 min (Fig. 2, C and G), and SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) in a more sustained manner (Fig. 2, E and H), whereas GLP-1 was without effect on either kinase (Fig. 2, D and F–H). There were no significant changes in the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), or SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) with either treatment of insulin (1 nm) or GIP (100 nm) alone (supplementary Fig. S3). These results indicate that synergistic action between insulin and GIP is required for phosphorylation. p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK Are Involved in GIP-mediated Resistin Secretion—In studies designed to examine the involvement of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK in GIP-mediated resistin secretion, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors of MAPK pathways. There was no significant effect on GIP-mediated resistin secretion by treatment with the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitors, PD098059 (75 μm) or U0126 (25 μm). However, resistin secretion in response to GIP was greatly reduced by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, and the SAPK/JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (50 μm) (Fig. 3A). There were no significant differences in cellular resistin levels following treatment with these inhibitors (Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggest that p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK, but not ERK1/2, are involved in GIP-mediated resistin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that changes in protein expression are not involved. The Effect of GIP on Epididymal Fat in Vivo—To determine whether GIP can regulate resistin secretion in vivo, peptide was systemically administrated to lean (Fa/?) or obese (fa/fa) VDF Zucker rats, using osmotic minipumps and conditions previously shown to increase adipose tissue LPL levels (23Kim S.J. Nian C. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8557-8567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Resistin was shown to be expressed in epididymal fat tissue of lean and obese VDF Zucker rats (Fig. 4A), and 2 weeks continuous infusion of low concentrations of GIP (10 pmol/kg/min) resulted in increased circulating resistin levels (Fig. 4B), but no detectable change in resistin protein levels in epididymal fat tissue (Fig. 4C). However, GIP infusion did increase tissue levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) and SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) in both lean and obese animals, when compared with controls (Fig. 4, D and 4E). These results correlate well with the in vitro results in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and support a role for GIP in the regulation of resistin secretion in vivo, acting through a p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK signaling module. Resistin Modulates PKB/LKB1/AMPK Phosphorylation and LPL Activity—Next, we examined the functional implications of GIP-mediated resistin secretion. In the earlier study, we demonstrated that GIP increased LPL activity and TG accumulation through a pathway involving increased phosphorylation of PKB and reductions in phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPK (23Kim S.J. Nian C. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8557-8567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Responses to GIP under these conditions were relatively slow and the possible involvement of an intermediary could not be excluded. We therefore tested whether resistin could act as a mediator of the action of GIP on adipocytes. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with resistin (10 nm) mimicked the effects of GIP, resulting in increased levels of phosphorylated PKB (Ser473), and decreased levels of LKB1 (Ser428) and AMPK (Thr172) (Figs. 5, A–C). In control experiments, there were no significant changes in levels of phosphorylated PKB (Ser473), LKB1 (Ser428), or AMPK (Thr172) during the time course of the study, confirming that these effects were GIP-dependent (supplementary Fig. S4). Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with resistin (10 nm) for 12 h resulted in a ∼3.4-fold increase in LPL activity, compared with control (Fig. 5D) and concentration-dependent effects of resistin on LPL activity were observed with EC50 values of 15.8 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results suggest that resistin could be an important mediator of GIP stimulation of LPL activity. Resistin Knockdown Greatly Reduces the Effect of GIP on the PKB/LKB1/AMPK/LPL Cascade—To evaluate further the functional contribution of resistin secretion to GIP effects on the PKB/LKB1/AMPK/LPL cascade, resistin was knocked down by RNA interference treatment. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with 100 nm of a pool of 3 resistin siRNAs resulted in greatly reduced resistin protein levels and an approximate 65 and 75% reduction in basal- and GIP-stimulated resistin secretion, respectively. The reduction in GIP-mediated responses was associated with attenuation of the effects of GIP on phosphorylation of PKB, LKB1, and AMPK (Fig. 6, C–E). These results complement the finding that resistin treatment resulted in decreased levels of phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPK (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, GIP-mediated LPL activation was also greatly reduced in resistin RNA interference-treated cells (Fig. 6F), supporting a role for resistin as a mediator of GIP-mediated increases in LPL activity. Basal phospho-LKB1 and AMPK levels appeared to be slightly increased in RNA interference-treated cells in the absence of GIP (Fig. 6, D and E). Basal phospho-PKB levels were undetectable. However, resistin may normally maintain a pool of PKB in the phosphorylated state, thus suppressing levels of phospho-LKB1 and AMPK, with loss of resistin removing this constraint. Because GIP-treated cells showed both a reduction in phospho-LKB1/AMPK and a small increase in LPL, there is likely an alternative pathway by which it can act. Since its identification as an adipocyte-secreted protein (25Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar, 26Kim K.H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), there has been controversy over the physiological roles played by resistin (adipocyte secreted factor). Because resistin administration to C57BL/6J mice resulted in glucose intolerance and reduced insulin sensitivity, whereas anti-resistin serum improved insulin resistance, it was suggested that resistin was the long sought after link between obesity and type 2 diabetes (25Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). Resistin levels were found to be markedly elevated in serum from insulin resistant mice placed on a high-fat diet and in obese rats and mice (25Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). Subsequently a number of groups reported a reduction in resistin expression in white adipose tissue from a number of obese rodent models including ob/ob, db/db, tub/tub, and KKA (y) mice (27Way J.M. Gorgun C.Z. Tong Q. Uysal K.T. Brown K.K. Harrington W.W. Oliver Jr., W.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Biol.

Biophys. 2003; 416: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite this, elevated serum resistin levels were found in high-fat fed or monogenic obese mice (28Rajala M.W. Qi Y. Patel H.R. Takahashi N. Banerjee R. Pajvani U.B. Sinha M.K. Gingerich R.L. Scherer P.E. Ahima R.S. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), similar to the elevated levels observed in the obese VDF Zucker rats. A number of studies have shown that resistin can act in an autocrine/paracrine manner in white adipocytes, although its actual role is obscure. Resistin mRNA is undetectable in 3T3-L1 cell preadipocytes, but its expression increases during differentiation to the adipocyte phenotype (30Gong H. Ni Y. Guo X. Fei L. Pan X. Guo M. Chen R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 150: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Addition of recombinant resistin, or increasing resistin expression via gene transfection promoted differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. Conflicting results have been reported for resistin effects on mature adipocytes. Fat-specific overexpression of resistin in a spontaneously hypertensive rat model was found to impair reesterification of free fatty acids to triglycerides (31Pravenec M. Kazdova L. Cahova M. Landa V. Zidek V. Mlejnek P. Simakova M. Wang J. Qi N. Kurtz T.W. Int. J. Obesity. 2006; 30: 1157-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas treatment of mouse adipose explants with recombinant FIZZ3, the human resistin equivalent, resulted in increases in both lipolysis and reesterification (32Ort T.

Resistin can also inhibit insulin-induced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (25Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). Resistin is additionally expressed in both human and mouse pancreatic islets (33Minn A.H. Patterson N.B. Pack S. Hoffmann S.C. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Harlan D.M. Shalev A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and exogenous resistin impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets (34Nakata M. Okada T. Ozawa K. Yada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although its physiological islet function is unknown. We showed previously that GIP, in the presence of insulin, increased LPL enzyme activity and triglyceride accumulation, through a pathway involving increased phosphorylation of PKB and reductions in the phosphorylated forms of LKB1 and AMPK (23Kim S.J. Nian C. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8557-8567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Unlike GIP action on PKB in INS-1 β-cells (5Kim S.J. Winter K. Nian C. Tsuneoka M. Koda Y. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22297-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), responses in 3T3-L1 adipocytes demonstrated a slow time of onset, suggesting responses involved release of an intermediary molecule that acted upstream of PI3K/PKB (Fig. 7). The present results suggest that resistin is a major contributor to the lipogenic effects of GIP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes because it induced identical changes in PKB, LKB1, and AMPK (Fig. 5). Knockdown of resistin using RNA interference resulted in attenuation of the effects of GIP (Fig. 6). The incomplete abolition of the effects of GIP is likely due to the involvement of other growth factors and/or hormones secreted by adipocytes. The current studies therefore provide a plausible explanation for the delayed responses to GIP: increased secretion and actions of resistin (Fig. 7). There are several ways by which GIP could have produced an increase in resistin secretion. It is unlikely to be through a major effect on resistin stores, because neither resistin levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes nor those in INS-1 (832/13) β-cells were influenced by GIP treatment (Figs. 2 and 3), even with incubation periods of up to 6 h. There have been only few previous studies on in vitro adipocyte resistin secretion. In 3T3-L1 cells, extended (24 h) incubation with insulin stimulated resistin secretion (35Zhong Q. Lin C.Y. Clarke K.J. Kemppainen R.J. Schwartz D.D. Judd R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas insulin-like growth factor-I (36Chen Y.H. Hung P.F. Kao Y.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1019-E1027Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and endothelin-1 (35Zhong Q. Lin C.Y. Clarke K.J. Kemppainen R.J. Schwartz D.D. Judd R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reduced secretion. GIP-induced resistin secretion peaked within ∼2 h. Wide variability in the patterns of adipokine secretion have been described in the literature, with a slow linear release of leptin over 24 h under unstimulated conditions (37Skurk T. Alberti-Huber C. Herder C. Hauner H. Endocrinology. 2007; 92: 1023-1033Google Scholar), but acute secretory responses of leptin (38Lee M.-J. Fried S.K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1984-1993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Commisotto P.G. Bukowiecki L.J. Deshaies Y. Bendayan M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and adiponectin (40Pereira R.I. Deaznin B. Metab. Clin.

Pflügers Arch. 2006; 452: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms underlying secretion of the adipokines are still largely undefined. Following biosynthesis, leptin undergoes trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network to reside in the limited cytoplasmic space surrounding the fat droplets (39Commisotto P.G. Bukowiecki L.J. Deshaies Y. Bendayan M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 42Bornstein S.R. Abu-Asab M. Glasow A. Päth G. Hauner H. Tsokos M. Chrousos G.P. Scherbaum W.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A fraction of adipocyte leptin appears to be localized in small vesicles (39Commisotto P.G. Bukowiecki L.J. Deshaies Y. Bendayan M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 42Bornstein S.R. Abu-Asab M. Glasow A. Päth G. Hauner H. Tsokos M. Chrousos G.P. Scherbaum W.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 43Roh C. Thoidis G. Farmer S.R. Kandror K.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E893-E899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that resistin also resides in intracellular vesicles and that GIP stimulates their production and secretion, as proposed for leptin (44Barr V.A. Malide D. Zarnowski M.J. Taylor S.I. Cushman S.W. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4463-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the present study, although GIP was shown to stimulate resistin secretion, there was no detectable effect on the levels of resistin protein in either acute experiments on 3T3-L1 adipocytes or in vivo in VDF rats. A potential explanation for this observation is that GIP increases resistin expression so as to maintain sufficient newly synthesized protein to support the increased secretion rate, without intracellular accumulation. This possibility was supported by the finding that GIP treatment resulted in increased Retn mRNA expression (Fig. 1C). In studies designed to identify signaling pathways responsible for GIP-induced resistin secretion, we established p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK as potential targets (Fig. 2, G and H). Interestingly, increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was rapid, but transient, whereas increases in SAPK/JNK did not reach peak levels until 1 h. This may explain why GIP-induced resistin secretion is maximal at 1–2 h following initiation of stimulation. As discussed previously (23Kim S.J. Nian C. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8557-8567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), low concentrations of insulin were included in all the studies because it is essential for the stimulatory effect of GIP on LPL activity and triglyceride synthesis. Under these conditions the ability of GIP to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and activate protein kinase A is blocked. It is therefore unlikely that cyclic AMP-mediated pathways contributed to the stimulation of secretion. A pharmacological approach was taken to confirm the kinase pathways involved. Application of MEK inhibitors did not influence resistin secretion, whereas inhibition of either SAPK/JNK or p38 MAP kinase greatly reduced secretion. Exactly where in the secretory pathway these kinases act is currently unknown. An additional uncertainty is the exact mechanism by which resistin acts in the adipocyte. As previously discussed (23Kim S.J. Nian C. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8557-8567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), application of the pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002, and wortmannin resulted in reduced phosphorylated LKB1/AMPK strongly suggesting that PKB at least partially mediated these effects of GIP (23Kim S.J. Nian C. McIntosh C.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8557-8567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The responses to resistin shown in the current studies did not reveal a definitive temporal relationship between PKB phosphorylation and reduced LKB1/AMPK, possibly due to close intracellular interaction between these enzymes. It has been shown that resistin increases phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cultured human endothelial cells (45Mu H. Ohashi R. Yan S. Chai H. Yang H. Lin P. Yao Q. Chen C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 146-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and aortic smooth muscle (46Calabro P. Samudio I. Willerson J.T. Yeh E.T. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3335-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), whereas the ability of resistin to impair insulin-receptor phosphorylation has been attributed to increasing gene expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (47Steppan C.M. Wang J. Whiteman E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Resistin also induced a transient increase in phospho-PKB in endothelial cells (48Shen Y.H. Zhang L. Gan Y. Wang X. Wang J. LeMaire S.A. Coselli J.S. Wang X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7727-7736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), although studies on resistin null ob/ob mice indicated that resistin normally suppressed PKB phosphorylation in skeletal muscle and liver. Importantly, as found in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, resistin treatment reduced AMPK phosphorylation in both the liver (49Banerjee R.R. Rangwala S.M. Shapiro J.S. Rich A.S. Rhoades B. Qi Y. Wang J. Rajala M.W. Pocai A. Scherer P.E. Steppan C.M. Ahima R.S. Obici S. Rossetti L. Lazar M.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1195-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 50Muse E.D. Obici S. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. McKay R.A. Rajala M.W. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (51Palanivel R. Sweeney G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5049-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and this may be a key intermediate molecule in resistin action. There are therefore clearly cell type-specific responses to resistin and the mechanistic link between PKB activation and reduced LKB1/AMPK phosphorylation remains to be clarified. Finally, what are the implications of these studies for the regulation of human resistin. There is only moderate sequence homology (∼53%) in coding and noncoding regions between mouse and human resistin (FIZZ3) (52Yang R.Z. Huang Q. Xu A. McLenithan J.C. Eisen J.A. Shuldiner A.R. Alkan S. Gong D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Additionally, although recent studies have confirmed that FIZZ3 is expressed in human adipocytes (53McTernan P.G. Kusminski C.M. Kumar S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2006; 17: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), monocytes/macrophages within adipose tissue express much higher levels, raising doubt as to its role in human adipose tissue (54Savage D.B.

However, resistin/FIZZ3 originating from immune cells could still play an important paracrine function in the regulation of adipocyte development and function. In view of the increasing evidence linking chronic inflammation in fat with the development of insulin resistance and type II diabetes (55Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (5240) Google Scholar, 56Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2006; 444: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (6390) Google Scholar) it will be important to establish whether there is a similar enteroadipocyte axis involving GIP and resistin/FIZZ3 in human fat.

Very low density lipoprotein receptor gene knock-out (Vldlr−/-) mice have been shown to develop subretinal neovascularization (NV) with an unknown mechanism.

This phenotype recapitulated what is seen in wet age-related macular degeneration, suggesting that this is a CNV model. The CNV correlated with overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor in Vldlr−/- eyecups and was blocked by a neutralizing antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. The wnt co-receptor LRP5/6 expression was significantly up-regulated in Vldlr−/- eyecups compared with that in wild-type mice. Significantly, Vldlr−/- mice showed impaired phosphorylation of downstream effectors of the wnt signaling pathway, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and β-catenin, concomitant with increased levels of free GSK-3β and β-catenin, suggesting an increased activity of the wnt pathway. Down-regulation of VLDLR by small interference RNA resulted in up-regulation of LRP5/6 expression and activation of β-catenin in cultured endothelial cells. Furthermore, Dickkopf-1, a specific inhibitor of the wnt pathway, effectively decreased vascular endothelial growth factor and β-catenin levels in the retinal pigment epithelium of Vldlr−/- mice and in cells transfected with the VLDLR small interference RNA. These results suggest that VLDLR functions as a negative regulator of CNV, and this function is mediated through the wnt pathway.

Moreover, Norrin, a downstream binding ligand of the Fz4 receptor, is associated with the vascular development in the eye, as mutations in or complete knock-out of this gene, as found in Norrie disease, results in congenital absence of intraretinal capillaries and a progressive loss of vessels within the stria vascular is in the cochlea (25Xu Q.

Meanwhile, the key protein in the wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin, has also been implicated in vascular development and remodeling (28Kim K.I. Cho H.J. Hahn J.Y. Kim T.Y. Park K.W. Koo B.K.

Very low density lipoprotein receptor gene knock-out (Vldlr−/-) mice were initially created to study the cholesterol pathway.

In a comprehensive ocular phenotype screen, Heckenlively et al. (32Heckenlively J.R. Hawes N.L. Friedlander M. Nusinowitz S. Hurd R. Davisson M. Chang B. Retina. 2003; 23: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) discovered through fundus examination that Vldlr−/- mice develop abnormal subretinal NV. To date, the underlying mechanism by which disruption of the Vldlr gene (knock-out) leads to the subretinal NV has not been elucidated. In the present study we have examined the role of the wnt signaling pathway in the subretinal NV in Vldlr−/- mice. Animals—Animals were maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with an ambient light intensity of 85 ± 18 lux at the cage level. Vldlr−/- mice on the C57BL/6 background and wild-type (wt) C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) were used, treated and cared for in accordance with the statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research set forth by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. Vldlr−/- mice were genotyped following a PCR protocol recommended by The Jackson Laboratory. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell culture reagents, fetal bovine serum, and chemicals were purchased from Invitrogen. ARPE19 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in an environment containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2. HUVEC were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM-2, Cambrex, NJ) maintained at 37 °C in an environment containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and endothelial cell growth supplement (SingleQuots, Cambrex, NJ). The cells were used in experiments between passage 4 and 6. Fluorescein Angiography—Angiograms were performed using intracardiac injection of 10 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated high molecular weight dextran (Sigma, FD-2000S) in deeply anesthetized mice. Eyes were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Hanks' balanced saline prepared immediately before use for overnight at 4 °C, and retinas were flat-mounted in Fluoromount-G. Immunohistochemistry—Eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Cross-sections (5 μm) were cut and mounted on slides. To reduce autofluorescence background levels, the sections were blocked with 2% mouse serum and 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Sections were stained with primary antibodies specific for VEGF (Santa Cruz, CA), β-catenin, GSK-3β, phosphorylated GSK-3β, and phosphorylated β-catenin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), LRP5/6 (ABCAM, Cambridge, MA), CD31 (BD Pharmingen), and a rabbit anti-RDH10 antibody (33Wu B.X. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Rohrer B. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Retinal sections were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h and washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline. Secondary antibodies were added and incubated with the sections for 1 h. The sections were finally washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in Fluoromount-G. VEGF ELISA—The human VEGF QuantiGlo ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was used to measure VEGF levels in HUVEC and ARPE19 cells, and the mouse VEGF Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Inc.) was used for mouse tissues following the manufacturer’s protocol. The samples of the culture medium were concentrated 10 times, and the samples from mouse tissues were diluted 10 times to ensure that the VEGF concentration fell within the range of the VEGF standard curves. Western Blot Analysis—The same amount (100 μg) of total proteins from mouse eyecups were used for Western blot analysis using specific primary antibodies for each protein and blotted with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (34Chen Y. Moiseyev G. Takahashi Y. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The signal was developed with a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Blots were then stripped and re-blotted with an antibody specific for β-actin. Each protein band was semiquantified by densitometry and normalized by β-actin levels in the same gel. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Mice eyes were enucleated immediately after death into chilled diethylpyrocarbonate-treated normal saline, and the retinas were dissected. Total RNA was isolated using a commercial kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Primers (VEGF forward and VEGF reverse) were designed from the cDNA sequences spanning >1-kb introns using the Primer3 software. Total RNA (1.0 μg) was used for RT reactions, and 1 μl of the RT product and 3 pmol of primers were used for realtime PCR with a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence changes were monitored after each cycle. Amplicon size and reaction specificity were confirmed by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The average CT (threshold cycle) of fluorescence unit was used to analyze the mRNA levels. The VEGF mRNA levels were normalized by 18 S ribosomal RNA levels. Quantification was calculated as follows: mRNA levels (percent of control) = 2Δ(ΔCT), with ΔCT = CT, VEGF - CT, 18 S, and Δ(ΔCT) =ΔCT,wt sample - ΔCT,Vldlr−/- sample. Injection of Neutralizing Antibodies Specific for VEGFR2 and VEGFR3—Purified neutralizing antibodies for VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 (generous gifts from ImClone System) were separately injected into the subretinal space of Vldlr−/- mice at age of P12. The eyes were dissected at P21 and fixed for NV analysis. Transfection of Small Interference RNA (siRNA)—The Cy3-labeled siRNA targeting VLDLR was commercially purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Transfection was performed using siPORT Amine (Ambion) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 × 106 HUVEC were incubated with the transfection mixtures containing 100 pmol of the Cy3-labeled siRNA for VLDLR or a Cy3-labeled control siRNA with a scrambled sequence for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Twelve hours after the transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove transfection mixtures and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum until they were used. Subretinal Injection of Purified Mouse Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) Protein—Purified DKK1 (R&D System, MN) was injected into the subretinal space of the right eye (5 μg/eye), and the same amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was injected into the left eye of Vldlr−/- mice at age of 4 weeks. Eyeballs were harvested 24 h after the injection, and the eyecups were dissected for analysis. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Student’s t tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. CNV in Vldlr−/− Mice—Vasculature in the retina and choroid in Vldlr−/- and wt mice at ages of postnatal day 12 (P12) and 6 weeks were analyzed by both in vivo vessel staining and fluorescein-angiography with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated high molecular weight dextran (25Xu Q.

Sci. 2006; 47: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the retina of Vldlr−/- mice at P12, retinal glial cells were observed to spread into the outer retina, as visualized by GFAP (a Müller cell marker) staining, whereas in wt mice, the GFAP signal was only detected in the inner retina (Fig. 1). Immunostaining of CD31 (an endothelial marker) demonstrated no detectable retinal neovasculature in Vldlr−/- mice at age of P12, but GFAP staining clearly demonstrated that abnormally increased GFAP-positive cells spread to the outer retina in Vldlr−/- mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Concomitantly at this age, choroidal neovasculature can be seen to have penetrated through Bruch’s membrane and the RPE from the choroid (Fig. 1D), in contrast to the preserved intact RPE layer in wt mice (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the NV is originated from the choroid in this model. At 6 weeks of age, Vldlr−/- mice showed abnormal NV throughout the subretinal space and the photoreceptor layer (Fig. 1, E-H), consistent with the previous observations by Heckenlively et al. (32Heckenlively J.R. Hawes N.L. Friedlander M. Nusinowitz S. Hurd R. Davisson M. Chang B. Retina. 2003; 23: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). By 6 weeks of age, the choroidal vascular network had anastomosed with the retinal vasculature (Fig. 1, F and H). In older Vldlr−/- mice (7 months of age), vasculature accumulated in the subretinal space, similar to the CNV in wet AMD (Fig. 1, I and J). Overexpression of VEGF and VEGFR2 in Vldlr−/− Eyecups—Because VEGF is widely considered the major angiogenic factor in the retina, we compared VEGF expression in the eyecups of Vldlr−/- mice with those in the age-matched wt mice at both the protein and mRNA levels. Western blot analysis demonstrated significantly elevated levels of the VEGF monomer and dimer in Vldlr−/- eyecups in comparison to the wt eyecups (Fig. 2, A and B). Real-time RT-PCR showed that the increased VEGF expression occurs at the mRNA level in Vldlr−/- mice (Fig. 2C). Moreover, VEGFR2 levels were also elevated in the Vldlr−/- eyecups (Fig. 2D). To provide additional evidence for the causative role of VEGF overexpression in the CNV in Vldlr−/- mice, we injected neutralizing antibodies (10 μg/eye) specific for VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 separately into the subretinal space of Vldlr−/- mice at age of P12. Immunostaining of CD31 at the age of 6 weeks demonstrated that an injection of the anti-VEGFR2 antibody abrogated the subretinal NV, whereas the same dose of the anti-VEGFR3 antibody had no effect on subretinal NV, suggesting the role of VEGFR2 in mediating the angiogenic effect of VEGF in this mouse model (Fig. 2, E and F). Altered VEGF Subcellular Distribution in RPE Cells in Vldlr−/− Mice—Immunohistochemistry detected intense VEGF signal in the retinal regions displaying NV (Fig. 3). High magnification micrographs showed that VEGF signal in the wt RPE was distributed near the surface adjacent to the Bruch's membrane but not near the surface adjacent to photoreceptors, consistent with previous observations of the polarized distribution of VEGF in the RPE (35Blaauwgeers H.G. Holtkamp G.M. Rutten H. Witmer A.N. Koolwijk P. Partanen T.A. Alitalo K. Kroon M.E. Kijlstra A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Schlingemann R.O. Am. J.

In contrast, the VEGF signal in the RPE was detected near the surface adjacent to photoreceptors in some RPE cells in Vldlr−/- mice (Fig. 3). Vldlr Gene Knock-out Up-regulates LRP5/6 Expression in the Eyecups—Because the wnt signaling pathway is known to play a role in regulation of VEGF expression and in angiogenesis (36Masckauchan T.N. Agalliu D. Vorontchikhina M. Ahn A. Parmalee N.L. Li C.M. Khoo A. Tycko B. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 5163-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 37Zhang X.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44650-44656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we compared the expression levels of the wnt receptor Fz4 and the co-receptor LRP5/6 in Vldlr−/- mice with that in wt mice. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that LRP5/6 levels were significantly increased in the eyecup of Vldlr−/- mice when compared with the wt eyecup (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, Fz4 levels were not changed in the eyecups of Vldlr−/- mice (Fig. 4). Additionally, to explore whether the loss of VLDLR regulates the expression of LRP5/6 gene expression, we compared LRP5/6 mRNA levels in Vldlr−/- eyecups with that in wt mice using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The mRNA levels of LRP5 and LRP6 in the Vldlr−/- eyecups increased by 2-fold over that in wt eyecups, indicating that VLDLR gene knock-out up-regulates LRP5 and LRP6 gene expression (Fig. 4C). Vldlr Gene Knockdown Up-regulates VEGF Expression in Endothelial Cells and RPE Cells—To identify the cell types in which the regulation of LRP5/6 by VLDLR occurs, we also performed double immunostaining of LRP5/6 and an RPE marker (RDH10) in the Vldlr−/- mouse eyecup. The results showed a co-localization of RDH10 and LRP5/6 in the RPE (Fig. 4E, 1-3). We also examined the expression of LRP5/6 in primary RPE cells from bovine eyes, HUVEC, and in human mono/macrophages. The equal amount of proteins from these lysates was blotted with an anti-LRP5/6 antibody. LRP5/6 was detected in the RPE cells and HUVEC, with the expected molecular weight as that in HUVEC but not in the macrophages (Fig. 4H). To reveal if VLDLR regulates VEGF expression at the protein or mRNA level, we have transfected HUVEC with the VLDLR siRNA using an siRNA with scrambled sequence as the negative control. The culture medium was collected and concentrated 48 h after the transfection for VEGF ELISA. VEGF secreted from both the HUVEC transfected with the VLDLR siRNA were significantly higher than in the cells transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 4I). The VEGF mRNA levels were also significantly elevated by the VLDLR siRNA (Fig. 4J). Activation of Downstream Effectors of the wnt Signaling Pathway in Vldlr−/− Eyecups—We determined the activation status of GSK-3β and β-catenin, two downstream effectors of the wnt signaling pathway, by measuring their phosphorylation status in Vldlr−/- mouse eyecups. The levels of phosphorylated and free GSK-3β in Vldlr−/- eyecups were compared with that in wt by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. Vldlr−/- mouse eyecups showed dramatically decreased levels of phosphorylated GSK-3β but elevated free GSK-3β in the eyecups when compared with that in wt mice (Fig. 5). Similar to what we observed with GSK-3β, phosphorylation of β-catenin, a downstream target of GSK-3β, was nearly completely abolished in Vldlr−/- mouse eyecups as shown by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for phosphorylated β-catenin (Fig. 6). The free form of β-catenin was increased in Vldlr−/- mice when compared with that in wt mice, demonstrating an accumulation of β-catenin in Vldlr−/- eyecups (Fig. 6). VLDLR Regulates the wnt Signaling in Endothelial Cells—To further confirm that VLDLR directly regulates the wnt signaling, we first determined if VLDLR and LRP5/6 are located in the same cells. Because VLDLR is well known to express at high levels in endothelial cells (39Wyne K.L. Pathak K. Seabra M.C. Hobbs H.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we determined the expression of LRP5/6 in HUVEC. Western blot analysis showed that LRP5/6 is expressed at high levels in HUVEC with the same molecular weight as that in the mouse eyecups, but not in rMC-1, a rat Müller cell line (Fig. 7A). To establish the regulatory function of VLDLR in the activation of the wnt signaling pathway, we used a specific siRNA to knock down the expression of VLDLR in HUVEC and measured the expression levels of LRP5/6 and subcellular localization of β-catenin, which is a downstream effector of the wnt signaling pathway and directly up-regulates VEGF expression in endothelial cells (18Easwaran V. Lee S.H. Inge L. Guo L. Goldbeck C. Garrett E. Wiesmann M. Garcia P.D. Fuller J.H. Chan V. Randazzo F. Gundel R. Warren R.S. Escobedo J. Aukerman S.L. Taylor R.N. Fantl W.J.

Biol. 2006; 26: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, the siRNA specific for VLDLR decreased VLDLR levels in HUVEC. In contrast, the siRNA significantly up-regulated LRP5/6 expression in the same cells compared with the cells treated with the same amount of the control siRNA with a scrambled sequence (Fig. 7, B-D). Realtime RT-PCR also showed that the VLDLR siRNA up-regulated LRP5 and LRP6 mRNA levels (Fig. 7E). Immunocytochemistry using the antibody specific for phosphorylated β-catenin showed that the treatment of HUVEC with the VLDLR siRNA reduced phosphorylation of β-catenin (Fig. 8, A and B). Immunostaining with an antibody specific for free β-catenin demonstrated increased levels of free β-catenin in cells treated with the VLDLR siRNA compared with that treated with the control siRNA. Moreover, the VLDLR siRNA treatment induced an increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a key step in its activation (Fig. 8, C and D). These results indicate that down-regulation of VLDLR alone activates the wnt signaling pathway in retinal endothelial cells. Inhibition"
https://openalex.org/W2023792327,"The first female meiotic division (meiosis I, MI) is uniquely prone to chromosome segregation errors through non-disjunction, resulting in trisomies and early pregnancy loss. Here, we show a fundamental difference in the control of mammalian meiosis that may underlie such susceptibility. It involves a reversal in the well-established timing of activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) by its co-activators cdc20 and cdh1. APC(cdh1) was active first, during prometaphase I, and was needed in order to allow homologue congression, as loss of cdh1 speeded up MI, leading to premature chromosome segregation and a non-disjunction phenotype. APC(cdh1) targeted cdc20 for degradation, but did not target securin or cyclin B1. These were degraded later in MI through APC(cdc20), making cdc20 re-synthesis essential for successful meiotic progression. The switch from APC(cdh1) to APC(cdc20) activity was controlled by increasing CDK1 and cdh1 loss. These findings demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism of control for the first meiotic division in mammalian oocytes that is not observed in meioses of other species."
https://openalex.org/W2093717906,"Transannular chemical reactions are unparalleled in their ability to generate high degrees of stereochemical and architectural complexity in a single transformation. However, the successful application of this approach in synthesis depends on the ability to predict and control the outcome of the transannular reaction. Use of a chiral catalyst in this context represents an attractive, yet unused, strategy. This report describes a catalytic, asymmetric transannnular Diels-Alder (TADA) reaction that affords polycyclic products in high enantiomeric excess. This catalyst system can also alter the inherent diastereoselectivity of cyclizations with substrates containing chiral centers. Additionally, the catalytic enantioselective TADA has been used as the key step in a total synthesis of the sesquiterpene 11,12-diacetoxydrimane; this route may provide a general approach to the polycyclic carbon framework shared by many terpene natural products."

Detailed (∼30 centimeters per pixel) images of this region were obtained with the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Planum Boreum basal unit scarps reveal cross-bedding and show evidence for recent mass wasting, flow, and debris accumulation. The north polar layers themselves are as thin as 10 centimeters but appear to be covered by a dusty veneer in places, which may obscure thinner layers. Repetition of particular layer types implies that quasi-periodic climate changes influenced the stratigraphic sequence in the polar layered deposits, informing models for recent climate variations on Mars."

We calculated the density of the south polar layered deposits by combining the gravity field obtained from initial results of radio tracking of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter with existing surface topography from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and basal topography from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding on the Mars Express spacecraft. The results indicate a best-fit density of 1220 kilograms per cubic meter, which is consistent with water ice that has ∼15% admixed dust. The results demonstrate that the deposits are probably composed of relatively clean water ice and also refine the martian surface-water inventory."

https://openalex.org/W2092034105,"Phospholipids are major components of cellular membranes that participate in a range of cellular processes. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a key molecule in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SLC1 has been identified as the gene encoding lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, which catalyzes PA synthesis. However, despite the importance of PA, disruption of SLC1 does not affect cell viability (Nagiec, M. M., Wells, G. B., Lester, R. L., and Dickson, R. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22156–22163). We originally aimed to identify the acetyl-CoA:lyso platelet-activating factor acetyltransferase (lysoPAF AT) gene in yeast. Screening of a complete set of yeast deletion clones (4741 homozygous diploid clones) revealed a single mutant strain, YOR175c, with a defect in lysoPAF AT activity. YOR175c has been predicted to be a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase superfamily, and we designated the gene LPT1. An Lpt1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Other than lysoPAF AT activity, Lpt1 catalyzed acyltransferase activity with a wide variety of lysophospholipids as acceptors, including lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidylinositol, and lysophosphatidylserine. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine accumulated in the Δlpt1 mutant strain. Although the Δlpt1 mutant strain did not show other detectable defects, the Δlpt1 Δslc1 double mutant strain had a synthetic lethal phenotype. These results indicate that, in concert with Slc1, Lpt1 plays a central role in PA biosynthesis, which is essential for cell viability. Phospholipids are major components of cellular membranes that participate in a range of cellular processes. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a key molecule in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SLC1 has been identified as the gene encoding lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, which catalyzes PA synthesis. However, despite the importance of PA, disruption of SLC1 does not affect cell viability (Nagiec, M. M., Wells, G. B., Lester, R. L., and Dickson, R. C. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22156–22163). We originally aimed to identify the acetyl-CoA:lyso platelet-activating factor acetyltransferase (lysoPAF AT) gene in yeast. Screening of a complete set of yeast deletion clones (4741 homozygous diploid clones) revealed a single mutant strain, YOR175c, with a defect in lysoPAF AT activity. YOR175c has been predicted to be a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase superfamily, and we designated the gene LPT1. An Lpt1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Other than lysoPAF AT activity, Lpt1 catalyzed acyltransferase activity with a wide variety of lysophospholipids as acceptors, including lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidylinositol, and lysophosphatidylserine. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine accumulated in the Δlpt1 mutant strain. Although the Δlpt1 mutant strain did not show other detectable defects, the Δlpt1 Δslc1 double mutant strain had a synthetic lethal phenotype. These results indicate that, in concert with Slc1, Lpt1 plays a central role in PA biosynthesis, which is essential for cell viability. The cell membrane is a semipermeable lipid bilayer found in all living cells that physically separates the cytoplasm of the cell from the extracellular environment. Glycerophospholipids and sphingophospholipids are the major components of most cell membranes.

PA is synthesized by two major de novo biosynthetic pathways that utilize either glycerol 3-phosphate (G-3-P) or dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) as precursors (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Sorger D. Daum G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 61: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). G-3-P is acylated by G-3-P acyltransferase at the sn-1 position to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). DHAP is acylated at the sn-1 position by DHAP acyltransferase to produce 1-acyl-DHAP, which is reduced by 1-acyl-DHAP reductase to form LPA. LPA produced by these two different pathways is further acylated by LPA acyltransferase in the sn-2 position to yield PA. In mammals, several LPA acyltransferase genes have been cloned, and their gene products have been characterized (3West J. Tompkins C.K. Balantac N. Nudelman E. Meengs B. White T. Bursten S.

In yeast, SLC1, originally obtained as a gene suppressing a defect in the biosynthesis of the sphingolipid long chain base (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Glycerophospholipids, including phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC), are synthesized from PA through the cytidinediphosphodiacylglycerol pathway. Cytidinediphosphodiacylglycerol is also used as a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin. Alternatively, PE and PC are also synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine and CDP-choline, respectively (Kennedy pathway) (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Kennedy E.P. Fed. Proc. 1961; 20: 934-940PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerophospholipids can also be generated by remodeling (also known as the Lands' cycle (17Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lands W.E.

Very recently, a gene for mouse lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acyltransferase was cloned by two different research groups and designated LPCAT1 (20Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T.

Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). LPCAT1 is highly expressed in alveolar type II cells and is thought to be involved in the production of surfactant lipids. A related gene, LPCAT2, which encodes an enzyme having both acetyl-CoA:lyso-platelet-activating factor acetyltransferase (lysoPAF AT) activity and LPC acyltransferase activity, has also been reported (22Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Nakanishi H. Harayama T. Ishii S. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6532-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this study, we searched for lysoPAF AT genes in yeast by measuring the enzyme activity of each strain in a complete set of yeast deletion clones. By this brute force approach, we identified a novel lysoPAF AT gene that did not show any homology with LPCAT2, and which we designated LPT1 (lysoPAF AT 1). LPT1 gene products possess lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity with a wide variety of substrate acceptors, including LPC, LPE, LPA, LPI, LPS, and LPG. We also characterized in detail the enzymatic activity and cellular role of Lpt1. Strains and Media—The complete set of Yeast Deletion Clones (Homozygous Diploid) and the parental strain BY4743 were purchased from Invitrogen. Other yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table 1. Strains were grown on either YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose), synthetic dextrose (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, and appropriate supplements) or synthetic complete (SC) medium (SD medium, with dropout powder) prepared as previously described (23Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Selection for integration of deletion cassettes containing loxP-kanMX-loxP was performed on YPD plates containing 200 μg/ml G418.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSource or referenceBY4743aStrain is congenic with S288CMATa/α his3delta1/his3delta1 leu2delta0/leu2delta0 lys2delta0/Lys2 met15delta0/MET15 ura3delta0/ura3delta0InvitrogenYOR175caStrain is congenic with S288CMATa/α YOR175c::kanMX/YOR175c::kanMXInvitrogenW303-1AbStrain is congenic with W303-1AMATa ade2-1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1(61Wallis J.W.

Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar) was digested with AatII, blunted, and BAP treated, and then the BsaB1-BsaA1 fragment containing the rop region from pBR322 was ligated to it to create YEp(rop). The LPT1 gene with its promoter region was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GAACACGAGAATTTACGCTTGT-3′ and 5′-CCGGACGACTTCTAGTTGC-3′ and ligated into the SmaI site of plasmid pUC19 to form LPT1/pUC19. The open reading frame (ORF) of LPT1 was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-GGTCGACTCATGTACAATCCTGTGGACGCTG-3′ and 5′-TTGAGCTCTACTAGCGGCCGCCCTCTTCCTTTTTTGAAATAGGC-3′) to introduce a SalI site before the first ATG codon and NotI and SacI sites just before and after the stop codon, respectively. The resultant fragment was ligated into pMW119 (Nippongene, Japan), and a NotI DNA fragment containing the triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope coding sequence or a NotI-SacI DNA fragment containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence was inserted to yield LPT1-ORF(HA)/pMW119 or LPT1-ORF(GFP)/pMW119. A 2.7-kb SalI-SacI fragment of LPT1/pUC19 was inserted into pMW119 (HindIII−), in which the HindIII site is disrupted. Then the plasmid was cleaved with HindIII and SacI, and the 3′-region of the LPT1 gene was replaced with the corresponding region of LPT1-ORF(HA)/pMW119 or LPT1-ORF(GFP)/pMW119 to create LPT1-HA/pMW119(HindIII−) or LPT1-GFP/pMW119(HindIII−). Finally, the SalI-SacI fragment containing LPT1-HA and LPT1-GFP was inserted into YEp(rop) to form LPT1-HA/YEp(rop) and LPT1-GFP/YEp(rop), respectively. His-382, a potential active site residue, was changed to asparagine by using the QuikChange site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using LPT1-HA/YEp(rop) as a template with the following primers: 5′-CTTCCGCATTTTGGAATGGTACCAGACCTGGG-3′ and 5′-AGTACCCAGGTCTGGTACCATTCCAAAATGCGGAAGTTAGG-3′ (altered nucleotides are underlined). The ORF of the PLB1 gene was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-AGTCGACATGAAGTTGCAGAGTTTGTTGG-3′ and 5′-TGCGGCCGCCAATTAGACCGAAGACGGCACTAATG-3′) to introduce a SalI site before the first ATG codon and a NotI site just before the stop codon, and the ORF was ligated into the SmaI site of plasmid pUC19 to form PLB1/pUC19. A SalI-NotI fragment containing the PLB1 ORF was inserted into YEGAp (25Hong J. Tamaki H. Akiba S. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2001; 92: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to form PLB1/YEGAp, in which the PLB1 gene was expressed under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. Strain Construction—The LPT1 allele was deleted in strains W303-1A and Σ1278b by using a PCR-derived loxP-kanMX-loxP cassette containing the kanamycin resistance gene (26Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) with the following primers: 5′-CGCCAAGACAAACCGTGGTGATTTAATTCTGCTGCTGATCGCTTCCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′ and 5′-GACAACAAGACTGTGACTTCCACACGCATCTGTCGTTTTTGGCCAGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′. The deletion of the SLC1 allele in strain W303-1A was made by transforming the cells with the loxP-kanMX-loxP cassette derived by PCR with the following primers: 5′-TTCAATAGAGAAGTTTAGTGGTTTCCCTCCGTCAGTGAATTCGAGCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTTTTTGGGTCTATATACTACTCTAAAAATGTGGTGGTGGCTTGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′. Haploid strains with single gene mutations were crossed, sporulated, and dissected to try to obtain double mutant strains. Enzyme Preparation for Screening—Each strain of the complete set of Yeast Deletion Clones were grown in 5 ml of YPD medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 at 30 °C overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were disrupted with glass beads by vortexing at 4 °C, and then subjected to an enzyme assay as described below, except that the reaction was performed at 30 °C. Preparation of Microsomal Fractions—Yeast cells were suspended in 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted with glass beads by vortexing at 4 °C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the crude enzyme fraction. The microsomal fraction was pelleted by centrifugation of the crude enzyme fraction at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in a small amount of the same buffer. Alternatively, cells were suspended in 5 volumes of spheroplasting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol); Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku, Japan) was added to a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 10–30 min. The spheroplasts were washed with spheroplasting buffer and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Teflon homogenizer. The cell lysate was further subjected to centrifugation and ultracentrifugation to obtain the microsome fraction as described above. We performed centrifugation at 18,800 × g before ultracentrifugation to avoid the degradation of Lpt1-HA. When we examined the enzyme properties of samples obtained at lower centrifugation speeds before ultracentrifugation, the reaction was not linear, and quick enzyme degradation was observed during the assay even in the presence of protease inhibitors. We found that the microsome fraction prepared after performing centrifugation at 18,800 × g was more stable and performed better in the enzyme assay even if the procedure resulted in the removal of a large amount of nuclei and nucleus-attached ER. Enzyme and Protein Assay—lysoPAF AT activity was measured by a modification of the procedure of Gomez-Cambronero et al. (27Gomez-Cambronero J. Velasco S. Sanchez-Crespo M. Vivanco F. Mato J.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.4 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 50 μm lysoPAF C-16 (Cayman Chemical Co.), 3 μm of [14C]acetyl-CoA (185 GBq/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.), 60 μm unlabeled acetyl-CoA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme solution. The reaction was performed at 0–15 °C for 20 min, after which total lipid was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42855) Google Scholar) and subjected to TLC. Samples were applied to DC-Alufolien Kieselgel 60 TLC plates (Merck) and developed with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v). The TLC plate was exposed to an imaging plate, and synthesized [14C]PAF was visualized and quantified with a BAS-2500 Bio-imaging analyzer (Fujifilm). The authentic [3H]PAF (6.0 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was detected by fluorography using EN3HANCE Spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To investigate the substrate specificities of this enzyme, various lysophospholipids and acyl-CoAs (Sigma or Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster AL) were used in place of either lysoPAF or acetyl-CoA. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Analyt. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Microsome fraction (2 μg of total protein) was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 0.1 μg/ml of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody or GFP polyclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked whole antibody (from sheep) (Amersham Biosciences) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, HA- or GST-tagged protein was detected by the Super Signal West Pico detection reagent (Pierce). Platelet Aggregation Assay—Total lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer and applied to an alumina column. The column was washed with chloroform, and the PAF fraction was eluted with chloroform-methanol (1:1). The eluted fraction was further loaded onto a paper fiber-made TLC sheet (Chromato sheet, Wako) and developed with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4). The area containing PAF was cut off, and the PAF fraction was eluted with chloroform/methanol (1:1), dried under N2 gas, and dissolved in 100 μl of bovine serum albumin/saline. Washed rabbit platelets were prepared by the method of Pincard et al. (30Pinckard R.N. Farr R.S. Hanahan D.J. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1847-1857PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrode's solution (160 μl, pH 7.2, containing 1.3 mm Ca2+) was mixed with 40 μl of washed rabbit platelets and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min. Then 10 μl of sample lipid was added. Aggregation was assayed by monitoring the change in light transmittance with a Hematracer PAT-4A (Nikko, Japan). Confocal Microscopy—The Δlpt1 mutant strain transformed with LPT1-GFP/YEp(rop) was grown in SC(Trp−) liquid medium to early log phase, and the cells were analyzed using a confocal microscope (FV1000, Olympus) equipped with a 100 × oil-immersion objective. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometric Analysis—LC/MS analysis was performed in the positive mode on an LCMS-2010 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an electrospray ion source. High performance liquid chromatography separation was carried out on a normalphase column (Develosil 60, 2.0 × 150 mm, Nomura Chemicals, Seto, Japan). The column was eluted with solvent A (acetonitrile-methanol (2:1) containing 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.4)) and solvent B (methanol-H2O (2:1) containing 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.4)) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The gradient separation was carried out using the following conditions: isocratic elution with 100% solvent A for 5 min followed by a linear gradient of 100% to 70% solvent A over 40 min. Spectra were obtained over a mass range from m/z 400–1200 with a scan time of 1 s. Identification of lysoPAF AT in the Yeast S. cerevisiae—We previously reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce platelet-activating factor (PAF) (31Nakayama R. Kumagai H. Saito K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To identify the gene for lysoPAF AT, we screened a complete set of homozygous diploid yeast deletion clones as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using [14C]acetyl-CoA and lysoPAF, we detected lysoPAF AT activity in both crude cell-free extracts and microsome fractions (100,000 × g pellets) of yeast. In the 4741 strains screened, we found one clone that did not produce [14C]PAF. This clone lacked ORF YOR175c, an as-yet-unidentified gene encoding a putative membrane-bound O-acyltransferase. We designated this gene LPT1. We deleted the corresponding gene in several yeast strains with different genetic backgrounds. All strains tested possessed lysoPAF AT activity, and when the LPT1 gene was deleted, the activity completely disappeared (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the enzyme activity increased when the LPT1 gene was introduced with a multicopy vector (Fig. 1A). We also prepared microsome fractions from the Δlpt1 strain transformed with the LPT1 overexpression vector or a control vector and used these fractions for PAF synthesis with lysoPAF and acetyl-CoA as the substrates. The lipids were extracted from the enzyme reaction products and analyzed by LC/MS. Synthesized PAF was identified by comparing their retention time in the column and m/z 524.4 with those of standard C16: PAF. The reaction with microsomes obtained from the Δlpt1 strain transformed with the LPT1 overexpression vector produced a time-dependent increase of C16:PAF production; this increase was not observed in the Δlpt1 strain harboring the control vector (data not shown), suggesting that LPT1 is required for PAF synthesis. The lipid fractions were further purified, and the PAF fractions were subjected to a platelet aggregation assay. The PAF fraction from the LPT1-overexpressing strain showed strong platelet aggregation activity, which was hardly observed when the PAF fraction from the Δlpt1 strain with the control vector was used (Fig. 1B) or when lysoPAF was omitted from the reaction mixture. The platelet aggregation activity was also strongly inhibited in the presence of 10−6 m WEB2086, a PAF antagonist (Fig. 1B). From these results we identified LPT1 as a lysoPAF AT gene in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Lpt1 Is a Member of the MBOAT Superfamily—YOR175c (LPT1) has been reported to be a member of the membrane bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily (32Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The MBOAT superfamily proteins harbor several membrane-spanning regions and share sequence similarity regions. Four other MBOAT genes are present in S. cerevisiae. ARE1 and ARE2 were identified as genes encoding ergosterol acyltransferases (33Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and the Gup1 and Gup2 proteins were initially reported to be involved in glycerol uptake (34Holst B. Lunde C. Lages F. Oliveira R. Lucas C. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 108-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Gup1 was recently proposed to be an acyltransferase involved in the remodeling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (35Bosson R. Jaquenoud M. Conzelmann A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); however, Lpt1 showed low similarity to Gup1 (15%/260 aa), Gup2 (14%/93 aa), Are1 (18.5%/108 aa), and Are2 (16.7%/234 aa). A search of databases for homologues of yeast Lpt1 identified several MBOATs, including SPBC16A3.10 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, OACT1 and -2 in both human and mouse (Fig. 2), and C54G7.2 and C08F8.4 in Caenorhabditis elegans. The predicted amino acid sequence of LPT1 shared 27.5% identity with OACT1 (per 459 aa) and 28.8% identity with OACT2 (per 458 aa). It was predicted that a conserved histidine residue within a long hydrophobic region might be a candidate for the active-site residue (32Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The corresponding histidine residue was found at position of 382 in Lpt1 (Fig. 2). To test whether His-382 is involved in the catalytic center, we constructed an HA-tagged mutant Lpt1 expression vector in which His-382 was replaced by asparagine. Although we confirmed the expression of both native and mutant Lpt1-HA in the microsomal fraction of the Δlpt1 mutant strain by Western blot analysis, we did not detect lysoPAF AT activity in the mutant enzyme fraction (see Fig. 6, B and C). From this result, we concluded that His-382 is critical for the catalytic reaction and is most likely an active-site residue.FIGURE 6Characterization of tagged and mutant Lpt1.

Microsome fractions from Δlpt1 cells harboring the native, mutant, or tagged Lpt1 expression vector were examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Substrate Selectivity of Lpt1—We tried to solubilize the enzyme from the microsomal fraction using various surfactants, including CHAPS and octylglucoside, but the enzyme activity was considerably decreased by solubilization (data not shown). We therefore used the microsome fraction from the Lpt1-overproducing strain to characterize the enzyme. Although the enzyme reaction was performed at 30 °C during the screening, we noticed that the enzyme activity decreased rapidly at this reaction temperature because the Lpt1 protein degraded even in the presence of various protease inhibitors (data not shown). For these reasons, the reaction was performed at 0–15"

For phagocytes to ingest the foreign materials, they form an actin-based membrane structure called phagocytic cup at the plasma membranes. Formation of the phagocytic cup is impaired in phagocytes from patients with a genetic immunodeficiency disorder, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). The gene defective in WAS encodes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP). Mutation or deletion of WASP causes impaired formation of the phagocytic cup, suggesting that WASP plays an important role in the phagocytic cup formation. However, the molecular details of its formation remain unknown. We have shown that the WASP C-terminal activity is critical for the phagocytic cup formation in macrophages. We demonstrated that WASP is phosphorylated on tyrosine 291 in macrophages, and the WASP phosphorylation is important for the phagocytic cup formation. In addition, we showed that WASP and WASP-interacting protein (WIP) form a complex at the phagocytic cup and that the WASP·WIP complex plays a critical role in the phagocytic cup formation. Our results indicate that the phosphorylation of WASP and the complex formation of WASP with WIP are the essential molecular steps for the efficient formation of the phagocytic cup in macrophages, suggesting a possible disease mechanism underlying phagocytic defects and recurrent infections in WAS patients.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binds to the Basic Region, whereas Cdc42 binds the GTPase binding domain. Binding of these cellular factors activates the WASP C-terminal VCA (verprolin/cofilin/acidic) domain, which in turn activates the actin-related protein complex (Arp2/3 complex), stimulating actin polymerization through the formation of F-actin branch junctions (8Miki H.

WIP plays a key role in regulating WASP, with which it appears to form a constitutive complex that functions as a unit in many cellular processes (26Anton I.M. de la Fuente M.A. Sims T.N. Freeman S.

For example, WIP is required for targeting WASP to the immune synapse after T-cell receptor ligation (6Barda-Saad M. Braiman A. Titerence R. Bunnell S.C. Barr V.A. Samelson L.E. Nat.

WIP also binds directly to F-actin and inhibits Ccd42-mediated actin polymerization; it synergizes with N-WASP to induce filopodia when overexpressed in fibroblasts (39Martinez-Quiles N. Rohatgi R.

A general role in filopodia formation is consistent with the requirement of WIP in pathogenic settings, notably the intracellular motility of vaccinia virus and Shigella, which involves the formation of an actin comet-tail mediated by the N-WASP·WIP complex (40Moreau V.

Phagocytosis is, therefore, essential for host defense against infection, neoplastic proliferation, wound healing, and tissue remodeling.The phagocytic cup is an actin-based membrane structure formed at the plasma membrane of a phagocyte upon stimulation with foreign materials such as bacteria. Efficient phagocytosis requires opsonins, which are host molecules (e.g. IgG antibodies or complement proteins such as C3b) that bind to the surface of foreign materials. The opsonins are then recognized by phagocytic receptors (e.g. the Fc receptor for antibodies or CR3 for complement proteins), which induce a signal that results in polymerization of actin at the site of ingestion and the transient formation of the “phagocytic cup.” Formation of the phagocytic cup is an essential first step in phagocytosis leading to digestion of foreign materials (56Leverrier Y.

Although it has been reported that WASP plays an important role in the formation of the phagocytic cup (49Lorenzi R. Brickell P.M. Katz D.R. Kinnon C. Thrasher A.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2943-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular details remain unknown.The podosome is also an actin-based structure formed at the plasma membrane of monocyte-derived cells such as macrophages, osteoclasts, and dendritic cells (76Linder S. Aephelbacher M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 376-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Podosomes are micron-scale, dynamic, actin-rich protrusions and play essential roles in chemotactic migration and extravasation of those monocyte-derived cells (77Carman C.V. Sage P.T. Sciuto T.E. de la Fuente M.A. Geha R.S. Ochs H.D. Dvorak H.F. Dvorak A.M. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2007; 26: 784-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In WASP-deficient WAS patients, the podosomes are completely absent, indicating that WASP is a critical component of the podosomes (43Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The phagocytic cup is also absent in WAS patients (49Lorenzi R. Brickell P.M. Katz D.R. Kinnon C. Thrasher A.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2943-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led us to postulate that WASP plays critical roles in the formation of both phagocytic cup and podosomes. However, molecular mechanisms of the formation of these structures including WASP are unclear. The present study focuses on understanding of the molecular basis of phagocytosis. Here we investigate how WASP regulates the formation of the phagocytic cup.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating factor-1 was purchased from R&D Systems.

RPMI1640, other tissue culture reagents, Alexa 568-labeled phalloidin, and Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen.Cells and Transfection—Human monocyte cell line THP-1 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. THP-1 cells (1-2 × 106 cells) were transfected with the WASP constructs (2 μg) using Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V and Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 2 days in RPMI1640 containing 10% FCS supplemented with 12.5 ng/ml PMA. For human primary monocyte isolation, 20-40 ml of peripheral blood was drawn from healthy volunteers after informed consent was obtained. Monocytes were isolated from blood samples using Monocyte Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% FCS supplemented with 20 ng/ml of recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating factor-1. Monocytes cultured for 4 days in this medium attained morphology characteristics of macrophages, and their differentiated state was confirmed by a flow cytometric analysis for CD14+ status. Monocytes cultured for 2 days were harvested and transfected with the WASP constructs using Human Monocyte Nucleofector kit and Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were cultured for 2 days additionally. Cells were co-transfected with GFP expressing plasmid, pmaxGFP (Amaxa Inc.), as a transfection marker. The efficiency of transfection measured using pmaxGFP was 40-60% for THP-1 cells or monocytes. Transfection of short interfering RNA (siRNA) was performed using DharmaFECT 2 (Dharmacon Inc.). The following sequences were chosen to generate siRNA for WASP, 5′-GCCGAGACCTCTAAACTTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGCCAGATCTCAATATCAT-3′ (scrambled). The efficiency of siRNA transfection measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated control siRNA, BLOCK-IT (Invitrogen), was 40-60%. The Internal Review Board of Burnham Institute for Medical Research approved these experiments.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—THP-1 cells seeded on coverslips were stimulated with 12.5 ng/ml PMA for 2 days. Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Fluka) for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were stained with Alexa 568-labeled phalloidin (Invitrogen) and anti-WIP or anti-WASP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the presence of Fc-Block™ (BD Pharmingen). The secondary antibody, Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Invitrogen), was used. Cell staining was examined under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan AR) or MRC 1024 SP Bio-Rad laser point scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad).Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of WASP, 0.5-1 × 107 cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-WASP monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 2 h and then incubated with anti-mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin binding the immune complex was washed with 0.5 ml of buffer A 3 times, and the complex was eluted with 1× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-WASP antibody, anti-WIP polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) (Upstate).Assay for the Phagocytic Cup Formation—Latex beads (3 μm diameter) (Sigma-Aldrich) were opsonized with 0.5 mg/ml human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline extensively, and suspended in RPMI1640 containing 1% FCS and 10 mm 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (Sigma-Aldrich). PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells or primary macrophages grown on coverslips in 6-well culture plates were incubated in prewarmed serum-free medium containing 10 mm 3-MA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells on coverslips were changed to 0.5 ml of ice-cold opsonized latex bead suspension at a ratio of 10-50 beads per cell and incubated for at 4 °C for 10 min to allow beads to adhere to cells. The formation of the phagocytic cups was initiated by the addition of 1.5 ml of prewarmed RPMI1640 containing 1% FCS and 10 mm 3-MA, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for a further 15 min. The phagocytic cup formation was stopped by fixation in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and cells were permeabilized and blocked by incubating for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Phagocytic cups were visualized by F-actin staining with Alexa 568-phalloidin (Invitrogen) and examined under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan AR).Assay for Phagocytosis—To assay phagocytosis, we measured the phagocytic uptake of IgG-opsonized fluorescence dye-conjugated latex beads (TransFluoSpheres; excitation at 488 nm/emission at 560 nm; Invitrogen) by THP-1 cells in the absence of 3-MA using a flow cytometer, FACSort (BD Biosciences). Cells were co-transfected with FITC-conjugated control siRNA and then incubated with IgG-opsonized fluorescence dye-conjugated latex beads. FITC-positive transfected cells were gated (FL1), and phagocytosis was expressed as the difference in the mean fluorescence intensity of ingested beads (FL2) measured at 37 and 4 °C.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from THP-1 cells using PureLink 96 Total RNA Purification kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA by oligo(dT) priming, the resulting single strand cDNA was amplified using Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). PCR primers used were β-actin sense (5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′), β-actin antisense (5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′), WASP sense (5′-TGGACCTAGCCCAGCTGATA-3′), and WASP antisense (5′-AGGGGTCTTGTTCAGCTGA-3′). PCR was done on 100 ng of single-stranded cDNA in the presence of 5 μm each oligonucleotide primer in an Applied Biosystems 2720 Thermal Cycler (40 cycles, denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 2 min). Aliquots of 10 μl of the amplification products were separated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and quantified by Alpha Imager analysis.Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences between groups was calculated by the Student's t test. Confidence (95%) was set a priori as the desired level of statistical significance.RESULTSExamination of the Phagocytic Cup Formation—When phagocytic receptors on macrophages are stimulated with opsonized foreign materials such as bacteria, phagocytic cups are transiently formed. After the macrophages completely ingest the materials, the phagocytic cups disappear (Fig. 1A). This rapid turnover of phagocytic cups makes it difficult to examine their formation. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a new experimental system. A phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase inhibitor, 3-MA, inhibits phagocytosis without affecting the formation of phagocytic cups, resulting in stabilization of the phagocytic cups (59Gagnon E. Duclos S. Rondeau C. Chevet E. Cameron P.H. Steele-Mortimer O. Paiement J. Bergeron J.J. Desjardins M. Cell. 2002; 110: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A). We took advantage of this effect of 3-MA on phagocytosis. To test this system, we incubated macrophages with IgG-opsonized latex beads (3-μm diameter) for 30 min. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa 568-phalloidin to visualize the phagocytic cups. Cell staining was examined under a fluorescence microscope. To quantify phagocytosis and th"

LGALS15 contains a predicted carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) as well as LDV and RGD recognition sequences for integrin binding. Studies tested the hypothesis that LGALS15 is a secreted regulator of blastocyst development, as well as growth, migration, adhesion, and apoptosis of trophoblast. Bovine embryos were produced in vitro by standard conditions, and putative zygotes were cultured in the presence of recombinant ovine LGALS15. Rates of embryo cleavage and blastocyst formation were not affected by LGALS15. LGALS15 moderately increased proliferation of ovine trophectoderm (oTr) cells. Staurosporine elicited apoptosis of oTr cells, which could be partially inhibited by LGALS15. Migration of oTr cells was stimulated by LGALS15 that was dependent on Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). A dose-dependent increase in oTr cell attachment to LGALS15 was found that could be inhibited by cyclic GRGDS, but not GRADS, peptides. Mutation of the LDVRGD integrin binding sequence of LGALS15 to LADRAD decreased its ability to promote oTr cell attachment, whereas mutation of the CRD had little effect. LGALS15 induced formation of robust focal adhesions in oTr cells that was abolished by mutation of the LDVRGD sequence. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that LGALS15 stimulates trophectoderm cell migration and attachment via integrin binding and activation which are critical to blastocyst elongation and implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2002287812,"Some nonavian theropod dinosaurs were at least partially covered in feathers or filamentous protofeathers. However, a complete understanding of feather distribution among theropod dinosaurs is limited because feathers are typically preserved only in lagerstätten like that of Solnhofen, Germany or Liaoning, China. Such deposits possess clear taphonomic biases toward small-bodied animals, limiting our knowledge regarding feather presence in larger members of feathered clades. We present direct evidence of feathers in Velociraptor mongoliensis based on the presence of quill knobs on the posterior forearm. This report of secondaries in a larger-bodied, derived, and clearly flightless member of a nonavian theropod clade represented by feathered relatives is a substantial contribution to our knowledge of the evolution of feathers."

The intramembrane cleavage of APP by γ-secretase occurs at two major sites, γ and ϵ, although the temporal and/or mechanistic relationships between these cleavages remain unknown. In our attempt to address this issue, we uncovered an important regulatory role for the APP luminal juxtamembrane domain. We demonstrated in cell-based assays that domain replacements in this region can greatly reduce secreted Aβ resulting from γ-cleavage without affecting the ϵ-cleavage product. This Aβ reduction is likely due to impaired proteolysis at the γ-cleavage site. Further analyses with site-directed mutagenesis identified two juxtamembrane residues, Lys-28 and Ser-26 (Aβ numbering), as the critical determinants for efficient intramembrane proteolysis at the γ-site. Consistent with the growing evidence that ϵ-cleavage of APP precedes γ-processing, longer Aβ species derived from the γ-cleavage-deficient substrates were detected intracellularly.

The β-CTF can be subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase at two major sites within the transmembrane domain (TMD), γ and ϵ, generating Aβ and an intracellular fragment known as APP intracellular domain (AICD) (6Sastre M.

Alternatively, an α-secretase-dependent processing of APP results in a shorter α-CTF/C83 fragment that can undergo similar cleavages (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is also known to cleave Notch, CD44, and other type I transmembrane proteins (8De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence requirement for γ-secretase-dependent cleavage seems relatively relaxed, depending more on the size of the extracellular domain of a substrate than the recognition of specific sequences (9Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The Notch processing resembles that of APP, with two homologous γ-secretase cleavage sites, S4 and S3, positioned in the middle of the TMD and near the cytoplasmic leaflet, respectively (10Hartmann D. Tournoy J. Saftig P. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T.

Notch β and Notch intracellular domain are the two cleavage products, with the latter being an important transcriptional activator (12Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is a multisubunit aspartyl protease that consists of at least four different membrane proteins, presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (8De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). PS is thought to be the catalytic subunit of the holoenzyme, containing two conserved intramembrane aspartate residues essential for substrate cleavage (13Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3173-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which γ-secretase recognizes and cleaves its substrates remain elusive, partly because these proteolytic events occur within a hydrophobic environment of membrane lipid bilayer. It has been shown that certain hydrophobic residues within the TMD of APP play a key role in determining cleavage efficiency as well as specificity (15Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Murphy M.P. Hickman L. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Other substrate domains are also implicated in regulating γ-secretase-dependent proteolysis. Studies using transition-state analogue γ-secretase inhibitors support the existence of substrate-enzyme binding sites beyond the TMD (17Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4560-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the cytoplasmic tail of APP is known to have little direct impact on its cleavage by γ-secretase (19Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), these data seem to suggest a role for the APP luminal domain in substrate-enzyme interaction and/or catalysis. Consistent with this view, numerous studies have shown that the alternative processing of APP as well as Notch luminal domain by different secretases could significantly alter their downstream cleavages by γ-secretase (20Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Schettini G. Bachmann M. Tabaton M. D'Adamio L. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2000; 2: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Kametani F.

The importance of the APP luminal domain is further confirmed by a recent study in which certain luminal juxtamembrane mutations were shown to inhibit Aβ generation (23Zhang J. Ye W. Wang R. Wolfe M.S. Greenberg B.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15069-15075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, Shah et al. (24Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the free N termini of APP and Notch luminal juxtamembrane stubs (exposed upon ectodomain shedding) are crucial for substrate recruitment by γ-secretase through their direct interactions with Nicastrin. Collectively, these studies provide ample evidence that the luminal juxtamembrane domain of γ-secretase substrate plays an important role in γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis. However, until now, it has not been investigated whether alterations in this region can differentially affect γ- and ϵ-cleavages, a potential mechanism that may be exploitable for developing safe γ-secretase inhibitors for AD therapy. In the present study we examined the significance of APP luminal juxtamembrane domain in γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis. Through a series of mutagenesis experiments using a C99-derived substrate that contains a Gal4/VP16 (GVP) signaling domain, we were able to evaluate the effects of juxtamembrane mutations on multiple cleavage events within the same substrate. Our data show that, similar to the wild type C99, C99-GVP is a functional γ-secretase substrate cleavable at both γ- and ϵ-sites. Domain swap as well as point mutations in its luminal juxtamembrane domain led to significant reduction in secreted Aβ without affecting AICD production. The divergent effects of these mutations on γ- and ϵ-cleavages further support a modulatory role for the APP luminal juxtamembrane domain in cleavage specificity in addition to its known function in substrate recognition and recruitment. Plasmid Construction—A pcDNA3.1-C99 plasmid similar to the previously described SPA4CT-LE construct (25Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was generated by a PCR method. The APP signal peptide was fused to the N terminus of the C99 fragment via the dipeptide leucine-glutamic acid linker. The method to generate the pcDNA3.1-C99GVP construct has been previously described (26Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Naslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, an AscI site was introduced immediately 3′ of the nucleotides encoding the triple-lysine membrane anchor of C99, where the GVP coding sequence was subsequently inserted in-frame. To make the juxtamembrane chimeras, a 19-residue luminal juxtamembrane domain in C99GVP (amino acids 606-625 in APP695) was replaced by corresponding regions from human APP-like protein 2 (APLP2; amino acids 674-693), Notch1 (amino acids 1716-1734), or sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1; amino acids 6469-6487), generating C99GVP-APLP2, C99GVP-Notch1, and C99GVP-SREBP1, respectively. All three chimeras were constructed by using a two-stage PCR method with two pairs of overlapping primers. Additional domain swap chimeras retaining the pre-TMD GSNK motif of APP, namely C99GVP-APLP2*, C99GVP-Notch1*, and C99GVP-SREBP1*, were generated in a similar fashion with a different set of primers. The C99GVP-SLSS quadruple mutant was also constructed with the same PCR method. Point mutations within the luminal juxtamembrane domain (i.e. C99GVP-G25S, -S26L, -N27S, and -K28S as well as APP695-S26L and -K28S) were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis. All cDNAs were verified by sequencing. The Aβ and Aβ-like peptides generated from C99GVP and various mutant substrates were numbered with reference to the first N-terminal residue (Asp-1) of the Aβ peptide. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibody against the last 20 amino acids of APP was purchased from Sigma and used at 1:20,000 for Western blots. The polyclonal AICD neo-epitope antibody was raised against a VMLKKK conjugate and produced in-house. Monoclonal anti-VP16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:500 for Western blots. Monoclonal antibodies 2H3 (specific to Aβ4-7), 2G3 (specific to Aβ33-40), and 21F12 (specific to Aβ30-42) have been described previously (27Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R.

Characterization of the AICD neo-epitope antibody is detailed in supplemental Fig. S1. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). All transfections were carried out in 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar). Three plasmids, pG5E1B-luc (200 ng), pCMV-β-gal (100 ng), C99GVP or various mutants (200∼400 ng), were added together to each well. FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for the transient transfection of adherent cells. Transfected cells were reseeded onto 12-well and/or 96-well plates (Costar) 16 h post-transfection; fresh media were added either with or without γ-secretase inhibitors. The cells and conditioned media were harvested 48 h posttransfection for analysis.

The Aβ-degrading enzyme inhibitors bacitracin (Calbiochem) and phosphoramidon (Calbiochem) were used at final concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 40 μm, respectively. All inhibitor treatment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Western Blot Detection of the Substrates and AICD—Forty-eight hours after transient transfection, HEK cells grown in 12- or 6-well tissue culture plates were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 in TBS) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). All samples were solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on 10-20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). The gels were then Western blotted with appropriate antibodies and visualized with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Immunostaining—Wild type or transiently transfected COS-7 cells (ATCC) were fixed at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min and subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. C99GVP and chimera substrates as well as AICD-GVP were detected by incubating the samples sequentially with polyclonal anti-VP16 for 2 h and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratory) for 1 h. All staining was visualized on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024ES confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) and captured with a coupled CCD camera. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Luciferase reporter assays were carried out 48 h post-transfection. Cells seeded on 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 20 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) per well. After adding 100 μl of luminescent substrate (Promega), the luciferase activity was measured with a MicroLumatPlus microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The β-galactosidase activity was measured similarly using a luminescent β-galactosidase substrate (BD Biosciences). As a control for transfection efficiency and general effect on transcription, the luciferase activity was normalized by the β-galactosidase activity measured on a duplicate plate. All measurements were done in triplicate, and similar experiments were repeated at least three times. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western Blot Detection of Aβ—Total Aβ peptides in conditioned medium or cell lysate were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight with 4 μg of the 2H3 antibody followed by incubation with 50 μl of a 50% protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) slurry for 1 h and 3 washes in the same lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer by heating at 70 °C for 5 min and resolved on 10-20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE or the modified Tris-Tricine/8 m urea gels (29Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). After transferring onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), the membranes were heated to 98 °C for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline, immunostained with the 2H3 antibody, and visualized with Super-signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Aβ ELISA—ELISAs used to quantify different Aβ species have been described previously (27Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides in the samples were captured onto 2G3 or 21F12 antibody-coated plates, respectively, and detected with a biotinylated 2H3 antibody. The fluorescence signal generated from a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Applied Science) was measured with a CytoFluor microplate reader (Applied Biosystems). Synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptides (Anaspec) were used to generate standard curves. All measurements were done in triplicates. C99GVP Undergoes Normal γ-Secretase-dependent Cleavages—γ-Secretase-dependent cleavage of C99/β-CTF at the γ- and ϵ-sites generates Aβ and the highly labile AICD, respectively. To facilitate the measurement of both cleavages, we engineered a C99GVP substrate in which a GVP signaling domain was inserted immediately after the triple-lysine anchor of C99 transmembrane region (Fig. 1A). In addition, the APP signal peptide was fused to its N terminus through a leucine-glutamate dipeptide bridge to maintain correct intracellular trafficking and membrane insertion. Cleavage of C99GVP by γ-secretase releases an Aβ-like peptide with the extra LE residues on its N terminus (30Lichtenthaler S.F. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as well as an AICD-like fragment (AICD-GVP) that can transactivate a luciferase reporter through its GVP domain (Fig. 1A). To confirm that C99GVP is a functional γ-secretase substrate, we transfected it into HEK 293 cells and characterized its expression and processing. As shown in Fig. 1B (top 3 panels, lanes 1 and 2, solid arrow), in the absence of γ-secretase inhibitors, the full-length C99GVP was readily detected by VP16 and APP antibodies as well as the 2H3 antibody that recognizes an N-terminal epitope (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, another band with slightly faster mobility was also detected by the former two (Fig. 1B, middle 2 panels, lanes 1 and 2, solid arrowhead) but was unrecognizable by 2H3 (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that it is an N-terminal-truncated fragment of C99GVP. Because previous reports have shown substantial stabilization of AICD after fusing with various protein tags (31Yamasaki A. Eimer S. Okochi M. Smialowska A. Kaether C. Baumeister R. Haass C. Steiner H.R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3821-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Kaether C. Schmitt S. Willem M. Haass C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is likely that this faster migrating band might be the ϵ-cleavage product AICD-GVP. Indeed, this fragment is about 4 kDa smaller than the full-length C99GVP, a difference expected for the putative AICD-GVP. We then tested whether this truncated fragment of C99GVP is sensitive to treatment with γ-secretase inhibitors L-685,458 (33Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B (middle 2 panels, lanes 3-6), this putative AICD-GVP was abolished after exposure to a high concentration of either inhibitor. In addition, the disappearance of this putative AICD fragment coincided with a significant stabilization and accumulation of the full-length C99GVP (Fig. 1B, top 3 panels, lanes 3-6). We then probed the same blot with an AICD neo-epitope antibody reactive to the free N termini resulting from ϵ-cleavage of APP. As expected, it detected a band co-migrating with the putative AICD-GVP fragment that was also sensitive to γ-secretase inhibitor treatment (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Finally, to examine the subcellular distribution of C99GVP, transiently transfected COS-7 cells were immunostained with the VP16 antibody. In the presence of DAPT, C99GVP showed a largely homogenous expression profile with no apparent nuclear staining (Fig. 1F, bottom right panel). In contrast, a prominent nuclear signal was observed without DAPT treatment, consistent with robust AICD-GVP generation and nuclear translocation (Fig. 1F, top right panel).FIGURE 2C99GVP juxtamembrane domain swaps differentially affect secreted Aβ and AICD production. A, schematic diagram and amino acid sequences of C99GVP and the juxtamembrane chimeras. The principal γ- and ϵ-cleavage sites in the TMD of C99GVP are indicated, as well as epitopes for the antibodies used in Aβ detection. A 19-amino acid sequence in the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of C99GVP was replaced by its counterpart from APLP2 (purple), Notch1 (green), or SREBP1 (brown). SP, signal peptide; LE, leucine-glutamate. B, the effect of domain-swap mutations on total secreted Aβ and AICD. Cell lysate from transiently transfected HEK cells treated with Me2SO or 5 μm DAPT was immunoblotted with 2H3 (top panel) or anti-APP antibody (middle panel). Conditioned media were also collected and IP/Western-blotted with 2H3 antibody (bottom panel). The open arrowhead indicates the C83GVP-like fragments derived from C99GVP or the chimeras. C, the effect of domain-swap mutations on AICD-GVP-mediated reporter transactivation. Cells treated with Me2SO (gray bars) or 5 μm DAPT (black bars) were assayed for their luciferase signals 48 h post-transfection. Data are shown as percentage transactivation activity compared with the Me2SO-treated C99GVP control. D, the effect of domain-swap mutations on secreted Aβ40. E, the effect of domain-swap mutations on secreted Aβ42. Conditioned media from the same Me2SO (gray bars)- or DAPT (black bars)-treated groups were collected and analyzed by ELISAs specific for Aβ40 or Aβ42, respectively. Data are expressed as percentage of the Me2SO-treated C99GVP control. *, p < 0.01. F, juxtamembrane domain swap in C99GVP does not affect substrate interaction with γ-secretase. Cell lysate from transiently transfected HEK cells was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the N-terminal fragment of PS1. The immunocomplex was resolved on SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with antibodies against PS1 or APP. Note that C99GVP and the juxtamembrane chimeras bind comparably to PS1. Solid arrowhead indicates AICD-GVP. NTF, N-terminal fragment. G, subcellular distribution of the juxtamembrane chimeras in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Note that the robust nuclear (N) staining of AICD-GVP in Me2SO (DMSO) controls was abolished after DAPT treatment, and a more homogeneous expression profile of the chimera substrates was revealed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) γ-Secretase inhibitor treatment not only led to the abolishment of AICD-GVP but also the emergence of a new protein fragment whose electrophoresis mobility is intermediate between that of C99GVP and AICD-GVP (Fig. 1B, middle 2 panels, lanes 3-6, open arrowhead). Interestingly, this nascent species was not recognizable by the 2H3 antibody (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 3-6), suggesting that it is an N-terminal-truncated C99GVP derivative as well. Considering the robust α-secretase activity in the host cells, this fragment is most likely C83GVP, a cleavage product from the C99GVP substrate. In support of this view, concomitant treatment with the α-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1 largely abolished this intermediate species (data not shown). After confirming AICD-GVP generation in HEK cells, we then tested its ability to transactivate a luciferase reporter gene that contains Gal4 response elements in the upstream activation sequence. As shown in Fig. 1C, no appreciable signal was detected from cells transfected with the reporter gene alone, whereas co-expressing an active form of GVP resulted in strong transactivation, thus confirming the specificity of this reporter assay. Robust signals, comparable to that of the GVP control, were also observed for cells cotransfected with C99GVP (Fig. 1C). Importantly, γ-secretase inhibitor treatment led to dose-dependent decrease of luciferase activity only in the C99GVP transfectant (Fig. 1C), indicating that C99GVP-induced reporter transactivation is γ-secretase-dependent. Some residual luciferase activity remained in the presence of excess γ-secretase inhibitors even though identical treatment completely abolished AICD production as measured by Western blot (Fig. 1B). This discrepancy likely results from the extraordinary sensitivity and nonlinear signal output of this assay (26Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Naslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol.

We used allosteric small molecules as a novel approach to better understand conformational changes underlying the inactive-to-active switch in native receptors. Allosteric molecules bind outside the orthosteric area for the endogenous receptor activator. The human muscarinic M2 acetylcholine receptor is prototypal for the study of allosteric interactions. We measured receptor-mediated G protein activation, applied a series of structurally diverse muscarinic allosteric agents, and analyzed their cooperative effects with orthosteric receptor agonists. A strong negative cooperativity of receptor binding was observed with acetylcholine and other full agonists, whereas a pronounced negative cooperativity of receptor activation was observed with the partial agonist pilocarpine. Applying a newly synthesized allosteric tool, point mutated receptors, radioligand binding, and a three-dimensional receptor model, we found that the deviating allosteric/orthosteric interactions are mediated through the core region of the allosteric site. A key epitope is M2Trp422 in position 7.35 that is located at the extracellular top of transmembrane helix 7 and that contacts, in the inactive receptor, the extracellular loop E2. Trp 7.35 is critically involved in the divergent allosteric/orthosteric cooperativities with acetylcholine and pilocarpine, respectively. In the absence of allosteric agents, Trp 7.35 is essential for receptor binding of the full agonist and for receptor activation by the partial agonist.

Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Conformational changes underlying the inactive-to-active receptor switch in GPCRs are in the focus of current research. In general, the receptor transmembrane helices (TMs) rearrange, allowing the intracellular loop region to unfold and to stimulate neighboring G proteins (3Lu Z.-L. Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Schwartz T.W. Frimurer T.M. Holst B. Rosenkilde M.M. Elling C.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 481-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Conformational changes include extracellular receptor regions, and a critical role of the second extracellular loop (E2) for GPCR activation and ligand binding has emerged (5Shi L. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Klco J.M. Wiegand C.B. Narzinski K. Baranski T.J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Rational development of agonistic drugs for GPCR activation requires deeper insight into such conformational changes. Because GPCRs are hardly accessible for crystallization, indirect approaches are applied that often involve modification of the receptor protein such as receptor mutagenesis, introduction of metal ion sites or disulfide bridges, or covalent linkage of moieties for fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Allosteric small molecules allow the study of native receptors. An increasing number of GPCRs is known to contain allosteric sites (10Christopoulos A. Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 323-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 11Wess J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); cinacalcet is the first allosteric GPCR modulator that has recently entered the market (12Brauner-Osborne H. Wellendorph P. Jensen A.A. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 1: 169-184Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Allosteric sites are located outside the orthosteric area that is occupied by the endogenous transmitter. Our strategy is based on the hypothesis that activation-related three-dimensional changes involve the whole receptor protein and thus include allosteric sites. Therefore, allosteric ligands should be useful to probe activation-related spatial rearrangement of the receptor protein outside the orthosteric binding area.Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, especially the M2 subtype, have served as an excellent model system to study cooperative interactions that result from simultaneous binding of allosteric and orthosteric agents (11Wess J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The so-called common allosteric site of muscarinic receptors resides extracellular to the orthosteric binding site for the endogenous activator acetylcholine. Until now, the consequences of muscarinic allosteric-orthosteric interactions have been studied with a focus on binding affinity. Affinity shifts are cooperative, i.e. the allosteric and the orthosteric ligand change each other's binding affinity toward the same direction and to the same extent. Depending on whether affinities are increased, decreased, or left unaltered, cooperativity is positive, negative, or neutral. The starting point of the present study was a previous observation that an allosteric-orthosteric interaction involved muscarinic receptor activation (13Zahn K. Eckstein N. Tränkle C. Sadeé W. Mohr K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We wondered whether allosteric interactions can be exploited as a new strategy to gain insight into activation related conformational changes. Applying allosteric small molecules as probes, we provide evidence that the full agonist acetylcholine and a partial agonist induce divergent conformational changes in the extracellular receptor region. We identified an amino acid, M2Trp422, that plays a key role for allosteric/orthosteric binding and activation cooperativity. This amino acid forms a junction between E2 and TM7 that appears to be essentially involved in GPCR activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsTest Compounds—Acetylcholine iodide, pilocarpine hydrochloride, carbachol chloride, oxotremorine sesquifumarate, oxotremorine-M iodide, atropine sulfate, N-methylscopolamine bromide, and gallamine triethiodide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and [35S]GTPγS and [3H]NMS were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Eckstein N. Tränkle C. Sadeé W. Mohr K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or wild-type CHO cells that were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant M2 receptor genes as described previously (16Prilla S. Schrobang J. Ellis J. Höltje H.D. Mohr K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One day before transfection, the cells were grown in 10-cm dishes by seeding 1.6 × 106 cells/dish. 48 h after transfection cells were harvested. Stably transfected CHO cells grown to confluence were treated for 24 h with 5 mm sodium butyrate added to the culture medium to increase receptor expression before harvesting the cells. The cells were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). After centrifugation membranes were resuspended and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Receptor densities as determined by [3H]NMS binding experiments amounted to 3–5 pmol/mg membrane protein in case of stably transfected cells and to 0.3–0.6 pmol/mg protein in case of transiently transfected cells.[35S]GTPγS Binding Experiments—[35S]GTPγS binding experiments were carried out as described before (13Zahn K. Eckstein N. Tränkle C. Sadeé W. Mohr K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using 96-well plates, the membranes (50 μl; final concentration, 50 μg protein/ml) were added to 400 μl of incubation buffer (final concentrations, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 10 μm GDP (final concentration) and the test compounds at the indicated concentrations. After adding 50 μl of 0.07 nm [35S]GTPγS (final concentration), the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. Membrane-bound radioactivity was separated by vacuum filtration. After drying, glass fiber filter mats were melted with scintillation wax, and radioactivity was counted.[3H]NMS Binding Experiments—Binding of [3H]NMS (0.2 nm) was measured in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of test compounds in 96-well plates under the conditions of the [35S]GTPγS binding experiments (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm GDP, pH 7.4, 30 °C), unless otherwise indicated. An incubation time of 6 h was applied to ensure equilibrium binding conditions in these experiments. Nonspecific [3H]NMS binding was determined in the presence of 3 μm atropine. As described before (16Prilla S. Schrobang J. Ellis J. Höltje H.D. Mohr K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), NMS binding affinity for wild-type and mutant receptors was determined in homologous [3H]NMS/NMS competition experiments. Allosteric probe binding affinity was derived from [3H]NMS/allosteric agent interaction experiments. Apparent affinities of orthosteric agonists were deduced from [3H]NMS/agonist interaction experiments performed either in the absence or presence of a fixed concentration of allosteric probe. Filtration and measurement of membrane-bound radioactivity was carried out as described above. [3H]NMS dissociation experiments were performed as described previously (16Prilla S. Schrobang J.

Glen R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 245: 43-53Crossref Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The binding site was defined as a sphere with a diameter of 10 nm around the residue M2Asp175, which is located in the center of the allosteric binding pocket. 50 different complex geometries in three main clusters were written out and scored with GoldScore. The best scored protein-ligand complex, which was in accordance with mutation experiments, was used for the following molecular dynamics simulation.Molecular Dynamics Simulations—For further refinement and structure validation, several molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the software package GROMACS (19Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). The simulations were performed for the ligand-free and the seminaph-occupied receptor and the ternary complex consisting of the M2 receptor, NMS, and seminaph, respectively. Further details including the model quality check have been described previously (16Prilla S. Schrobang J. Ellis J. Höltje H.D. Mohr K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Data and Statistical Analysis—Indicated are the mean values ± standard error. Nonlinear regression analysis was done using the software PRISM 4.03 and INSTAT 3.0 (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Data from [35S]GTPγS binding studies were analyzed according to a ternary complex model, which explicitly includes effects of the allosteric ligand on receptor activation (20Hall D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1412-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Ractive/Rt=L.(1+α.k.[A]+β.M.[B](1+α.γ.δ.k.[A]))1+L+M.[B](1+β.L)+K.[A](1+α.L+γ.M.[B](1+α.β.δ.L))(Eq. 1) Ractive/Rt is the fraction of active receptors relative to the total population of receptors. K and M are the association constants of the orthosteric agonist A and the allosteric agent B, respectively. L denotes the receptor isomerization constant. α and β indicate the intrinsic efficacy of A and B, respectively. γ represents the binding cooperativity between A and B, and δ represents the activation cooperativity between A and B. The zero level of muscarinic receptor dependent [35S]GTPγS binding was defined as the binding in the presence of 1 μm of the inverse agonist atropine, Ractive/Rt = 0.0. The maximum effect of the full agonist acetylcholine on [35S]GTPγS observed under control conditions in the absence of another test compound was set as Ractive/Rt = 1.0. Global nonlinear curve fitting of fractional receptor activation Ractive/Rt as the dependent variable with A and B as the independent variables yielded estimates for L, K, M, α, β, γ, and δ.Allosteric Probe Effects—The effect of naphmethonium on [3H]NMS equilibrium binding was analyzed as described (21Ehlert F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 35: 187-194Google Scholar, 22Lazareno S. Birdsall N.J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 362-378PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]NMS binding data derived from inhibition experiments with an agonist in the absence and presence of allosteric agent were fitted globally according to the extended allosteric ternary complex model using Equation 34 in Ref. 22Lazareno S. Birdsall N.J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 362-378PubMed Google Scholar. Specifically, fractional occupancy was fitted as the dependent variable with the concentrations of the agonist and the allosteric agent as two independent variables. After fixing the affinities of the radioligand and the allosteric agent to parameter values having been determined in separate experiments, curve fitting yielded estimates of agonist affinity and agonist cooperativity with naphmethonium.RESULTSAgonist-dependent Receptor Sensitivity to Allosteric Probes—We used M2 receptors expressed in membranes from CHO cells transfected with the human receptor gene. Receptor activation leads to G protein stimulation, which was measured using the GTP analogue [35S]GTPγS that binds to an activated G protein but is not hydrolyzed (23Lazareno S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 106: 231-245PubMed Google Scholar). To induce receptor activation we applied the endogenous full agonist acetylcholine, the partial agonist pilocarpine, and additional agonists as specified below. As allosteric probes we chose the flexible “spaghetti-like” bis(ammonio)alkane-type compounds naphmethonium and W84, their shortened derivatives seminaph and propyl-semiW84, the rigid “disk-like” alcuronium, and the smaller gallamine (all structures shown in supplemental Fig. S1).Naphmethonium (Fig. 1A) and the other probes hardly affected the basal, starting level of G protein activity but discriminated sensitively between pilocarpine- and acetylcholine-bound receptors (Fig. 1B, left and right panels, respectively). As expected, the partial agonist pilocarpine induced a significantly lower maximum response than did the endogenous full agonist acetylcholine. Naphmethonium reduced the maximum response of pilocarpine but not of acetylcholine. The potency as indicated by the inflection point of the curve was allosterically increased with pilocarpine but strongly decreased with acetylcholine (arrows in Fig. 1B indicate the inflection point shift to the left and right, respectively).To parameterize the findings obtained with naphmethonium (Fig. 1C) and the other probes (supplemental Fig. S2), we applied Hall's allosteric two-state model (20Hall D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1412-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The model assumes that receptors switch spontaneously between inactive and active (G protein stimulating) states (Fig. 2, gray and green panels, respectively). A ligand, either orthosteric or allosteric, may bind to these states with different affinities, thus affecting the equilibrium between inactive and active states. The model does not exclude that ligand-bound receptors differ in conformation depending on the type of bound ligand (20Hall D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1412-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). When orthosteric ligand and allosteric probe are present simultaneously, reciprocal cooperative interactions may occur between these ligands with respect to both binding affinity and receptor activation (log γ and log δ in Fig. 1C). Depending on whether these parameters are increased, decreased, or left unchanged, cooperativity is positive, negative, or neutral, respectively.FIGURE 2Allosteric two state model of receptor activation by Hall (20Hall D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1412-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Possible states of receptor occupancy according to the ternary complex model of allosteric/orthosteric interactions are displayed for inactive (gray front panel) and active receptors (green background panel). In each state of occupancy, the receptor can switch between the inactive conformation R and the active conformation R*. The parameters are explained in the legend for Fig. 1C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With pilocarpine, all probes except gallamine displayed negative cooperativity of receptor activation, whereas binding cooperativity varied depending on the probe (Table 1). With acetylcholine, however, there was no evidence for impaired receptor activation with any of the probes, whereas binding cooperativity was strongly negative with all probes. The divergent cooperativities with allosteric probes suggest a pronounced difference in three-dimensional shape of the allosteric site between the acetylcholine-bound and the pilocarpine-bound receptor.TABLE 1Test compound actions in terms of the allosteric two state model of receptor activation Underlying experimental data are displayed in supplemental Fig. S2.

Agonist concentration-effect curves for M2 receptor-mediated [35S]GTPγS binding were analyzed on a descriptive level with the inflection point and the upper plateau of the curve, indicating agonist potency and intrinsic efficacy, respectively. Control values obtained in the absence of allosteric probe are compiled in Table 2, allosteric changes of these parameters are illustrated in Fig. 3. The allosteric agents reduced the potency of the full agonists acetylcholine, carbachol, oxotremorine, and oxotremorine M to a similar extent by ∼2–3 orders of magnitude, whereas the potency of the partial agonist pilocarpine was not reduced or even increased (Fig. 3A). Vice versa, the maximum effect of the full agonists was hardly changed by the allosteric probes, whereas a strong reduction of efficacy was observed with the partial agonist (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we conclude that the difference in sensitivity between acetylcholine and pilocarpine to allosteric modulation is related to their full and partial agonist character, respectively.TABLE 2Potency and efficacy of the orthosteric agonists under control conditions in [35S]GTPγS binding experiments Pairwise recording of concentration-effect curves of the agonist under study and of acetylcholine for comparison.

Antony J. Tränkle C. Holzgrabe U. Mohr K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 372: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In that study we compared structure-binding relationships for stepwise shortened allosteric agents in M2 receptors whose orthosteric site was occupied by either the radioantagonist [3H]NMS or the radioagonist [3H]oxotremorine M. Being an inverse agonist NMS stabilizes the receptor in an inactive conformation. We predicted that the binding cooperativities found in the present study with acetylcholine should differ from binding cooperativities with the antagonist NMS, and we wondered how these cooperativities would compare with those found for pilocarpine.As shown in Fig. 4, there is no correlation between the binding cooperativities of the probes with acetylcholine and NMS, respectively. In contrast, probe/NMS binding cooperativities strongly correlate with probe/pilocarpine binding cooperativities"
https://openalex.org/W2029625635,"beta-arrestins (beta-Arrs) are known to be associated with tumor signaling pathways such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), P53/Murine double minute (MDM2) and NF-kappaB. To investigate the role of beta-Arr in tumor progression in vivo, we generated beta-Arr transgenic mice by subcutaneously inoculating tumor cells in them. We found that the xenograft tumor initiated earlier and grew more rapidly in beta-Arr1 transgenic mice than in both the beta-Arr2 transgenic and wild-type mice after inoculating murine liver cancer Hepa1-6 cells or lymphoma EL4 cells. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) activity, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration in plasma and new small blood vessel formation in tumor tissues were enhanced in beta-Arr1 transgenic mice compared with those in control mice. In addition, injection of MMP9 inhibitors in beta-Arr1 transgenic mice abrogated all these effects and suppressed rapid tumor progression. Similar results were observed in human microvascular endothelial cells, where overexpressed beta-Arr1 did increase MMP9 activity and small blood vessel formation. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors could suppress beta-Arr1-enhanced MMP9 activity and the C-terminal 181-418 amino acids (aa) of beta-Arr1 was largely responsible for this effect. Our data reveal a functional role for beta-arrestin1 in tumor progression in vivo, in which overexpression of beta-Arr1 promotes MMP9 activity and tumor angiogenesis by providing a suitable microenvironment for tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2008365492,"Whole cell patch clamp investigations were carried out to clarify the pH sensitivity of native and recombinant P2X3 receptors. In HEK293 cells permanently transfected with human (h) P2X3 receptors (HEK293-hP2X3 cells), an acidic pH shifted the concentration-response curve for α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-meATP) to the right and increased its maximum. An alkalic pH did not alter the effect of α,β-meATP. Further, a low pH value increased the activation time constant (τon) of the α,β-meATP current; the fast and slow time constants of desensitization (τdes1, τdes2) were at the same time also increased. Finally, acidification accelerated the recovery of P2X3 receptors from the desensitized state. Replacement of histidine 206, but not histidine 45, by alanine abolished the pH-induced effects on hP2X3 receptors transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Changes in the intracellular pH had no effect on the amplitude or time course of the α,β-meATP currents. The voltage sensitivity and reversal potential of the currents activated by α,β-meATP were unaffected by extracellular acidification. Similar effects were observed in a subpopulation of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons expressing homomeric P2X3 receptor channels. It is suggested that acidification may have a dual effect on P2X3 channels, by decreasing the current amplitude at low agonist concentrations (because of a decrease in the rate of activation) and increasing it at high concentrations (because of a decrease in the rate of desensitization). Thereby, a differential regulation of pain sensation during e.g. inflammation may occur at the C fiber terminals of small DRG neurons in peripheral tissues.

It is also known that continuous administration of low pH buffered solutions into human skin evokes instant pain and hyperalgesia to mechanical stimulation (12Steen K.H. Reeh P.W. Neurosci.

P2X receptors represent a family of ligand-gated cationic channels that open in response to the binding of ATP, possess two transmembrane domains, intracellular N and C termini, a large extracellular loop, and assemble as homo- or heterotrimers (19North R.A.

In peripheral tissues, large quantities of ATP may leave the intracellular space in response to tissue trauma, tumors, inflammation, migraine, or visceral distension (22Burnstock G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting P2X receptor activation and the subsequent depolarization of the sensory cell membrane initiate action potentials that are perceived centrally as pain. Although sensory neurons express all known P2X subunits, the homomeric P2X3 and the heteromeric P2X2/3 receptors occur in these cells at the highest density (23Chizh B.A. Illes P. Pharmacol.

Whereas agonist-induced currents through recombinant P2X2 and P2X2/3 receptor channels (17King B.F. Wildman S.S. Ziganshina L.E. Pintor J. Burnstock G. Br. J.

Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The failure to use more than a single concentration of α,β-meATP did not allow to construct concentration-response relationships for the P2X3 receptor subunit. Bullfrog DRG and rat nodose ganglion neurons are known to possess native P2X1, P2X2, and P2X3 receptors. Application of ATP onto these cells evoked non-desensitizing currents resembling P2X2 or P2X2/3 receptor activation (19North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). These currents were enhanced by acidification, suggesting that extracellular protons can regulate the function of ATP-gated receptor channels in bullfrog DRG and rat nodose ganglion neurons (25Li C.

Pflugers Arch. 1997; 433: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of acidification on recombinant human P2X3 receptors (hP2X3R) transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. It was found that a change of pH from the normal 7.4 to 5.8 markedly decelerated both the kinetics of channel opening and the subsequent speed of desensitization, and thereby depressed currents caused by low, but facilitated currents caused by high agonist concentrations. Our findings demonstrate a dual, agonist concentration-dependent effect of acid pH at homomeric P2X3 receptors which may allow a differential modulation of pain sensation in response to small or large quantities of ATP released by noxious stimulation. Culturing of HEK293-hP2X3 Cells—The maintenance of HEK293 cells and their stable transfection with hP2X3R cDNA have been described previously (27Gerevich Z. Zadori Z. Müller C. Wirkner K. Schröder W. Rubini P. Illes P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 151: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were kept in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium also containing 25 mm HEPES, 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 1 mg/ml d-glucose, 4 μg/ml pyridoxine (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (all Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml geneticin (both from Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in humidified air. They were plated on 35-mm plastic dishes (Sarstedt, Nürnberg, Germany) for electrophysiological recordings. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Transfection Procedures—The human P2X3 receptor cDNA (GenBank® accession number NM-00255) was subcloned per PstI and EcoRI restriction sites into pIRES2-EGFP vector from Clontech Laboratories (Mountain View, CA) for independent expression of P2X3 and EGFP, creating the pIR-P2 plasmid. All P2X3 receptor mutants were generated by introducing point mutations into the pIR-P2 construct, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the instruction manual. HEK293 cells were plated in 35-mm plastic dishes 1 day before transient transfection. 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA per dish was combined with 10 μl of Polyfect reagent from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and 100 μl of Optimem (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). After 10 min of incubation, the lipid-DNA complexes were introduced to the cells. Approximately 18-h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with Optimem to remove residual Plasmid DNA. Electrophysiological recordings took place 48–72 h after transient transfection during maximum protein expression. P2X3 receptor-positive cells were detected by viewing EGFP fluorescence with a fluorescence microscope. Preparation of DRG Neuronal Cultures—One-day-old Wistar rats (own breed) were used in the study. The animals were killed under CO2 and decapitated to obtain cell cultures of DRG neurons. The isolation and culturing procedures of thoracic and lumbar DRG cells have been described in detail previously (28Gerevich Z. Borvendeg S.J. Schröder W. Franke H. Wirkner K. Nörenberg W. Fürst S. Gillen C. Illes P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Gerevich Z. Müller C. Illes P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 521: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DRG cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells onto 35-mm plastic dishes coated by poly-l-lysine (25 μg/ml) (Sarstedt). They were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 35 mm total glucose, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 15 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 30 ng/ml nerve growth factor, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml selenium (Sigma). Primary cultures of rat DRG neurons were maintained for 2–4 days in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C, 5% CO2) before experimentation. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recordings—Whole cell patchclamp recordings were performed 2–6 days after the splitting of permanently transfected HEK293 cells, and 2–4 days after the plating of rat DRG neurons, at room temperature (20–22 °C), using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Patch pipettes (3–5 MΩ) for both HEK293 cells and DRG neurons were filled with intracellular solution of the following composition (in mm): 135 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 20 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 1 CaCl2, 1.5 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Li-GTP, pH was adjusted with CsOH. The external solution consisted of (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 11 glucose, pH was adjusted with NaOH. The pH of all solutions was routinely checked before and during experiments. All recordings were made at a holding potential of –70 mV. Data were filtered at 2 kHz with the in-built filter of the Axopatch 200B, digitized at 5 kHz, and stored on a laboratory computer using a Digidata 1200 interface and pClamp 10.0 software (Molecular Devices). Drugs were dissolved in external solution and applied locally to single cells, using a rapid solution change system (SF-77B Perfusion Fast-Step, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT; 10–90% rise time of the junction potential at an open pipette tip was 1–4 ms). Concentration-response curves for the P2X3 receptor currents at different pH values were constructed by applying every 5 min increasing concentrations of α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-meATP). To analyze P2X3 currents from the same cells at different pH values, α,β-meATP was applied at a given concentration six times with 5-min intervals. After the recording of two α,β-meATP-induced inward currents of the same size at pH 7.4, the pH was changed 2.5 min after the second α,β-meATP administration. Two α,β-meATP currents were recorded at the altered pH value and two further ones at pH 7.4 again. When recording from DRG cells, amiloride (200 μm) was given to the bath solution to block ASICs. This concentration of amiloride did not affect P2X3 currents either in HEK293-hP2X3 cells or in DRG neurons (see “Results”). Concentration-response curves established to determine the agonistic effects of α,β-meATP were fitted to mean data points using Equation 1, I=Imax×[A]nH/([A]nH+EC50nH)(Eq. 1) where I is the observed current, Imax the extrapolated maximal current, [A] the α,β-meATP concentration in μm, EC50 the concentration of α,β-meATP that produces 50% of Imax and nH the Hill coefficient (slope value) (SigmaPlot, SPSS, Erkrath, Germany). In experiments investigating the kinetics of P2X3 currents, decay phases of the curves were fitted by the following biexponential function in Equation 2, y=A1×e-t/τdes1+A2×e-t/τdes2+P(Eq. 2) using the in-built function of the pClamp 10.0 software (Molecular Devices), where A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes of the first and second exponential, τdes1 and τdes2 are the desensitization time constants, and P is plateau. The onset time constants (τon(10–90%)) were calculated from the individual recordings, under the assumption that despite the relatively slow local application they give a rough approximation of the kinetics of channel opening. The effect of a pH change on the receptor activation and desensitization was found to be concentration-independent and was expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the time constant ratios at each concentration investigated. In experiments examining the recovery of P2X3 receptors from desensitization, HEK293 cells were stimulated repetitively with α,β-meATP at 3 μm (5-s pulses, each) with a progressive increase in the interpulse intervals. The recovery from desensitization was fitted using the following Equation 3 (30Sokolova E. Skorinkin A. Fabbretti E. Masten L. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 1048-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), I=Imax+Imax-Imin1+e(t50-t)/b(Eq. 3) where Imax and Imin are the start and finish levels during recovery, t is the time, t50 is the time to regain 50% of maximally recovered currents, and b is the slope factor giving the change in time per e-fold change in recovery. Materials and Drugs—α,β-Methylene ATP lithium salt (α,β-meATP) and amiloride hydrochloride were both purchased from Sigma. The drugs were prepared as a concentrated stock solution in distilled water and were diluted to the final concentration in external medium. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed off-line using pClamp 10.0 software (Molecular Devices). Figures show mean ± S.E. values of n experiments. Student's t test or one way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. A probability level of 0.05 or less was considered to reflect a statistically significant difference. Effect of Extracellular Protons on P2X3 Currents in HEK293-hP2X3 Cells—Application of various concentrations of α,β-meATP to HEK293 cells permanently transfected with hP2X3Rs (HEK293-hP2X3 cells) induced inward current responses (Fig. 1A). Acidification of the extracellular solution had 3-fold effects on the concentration-response curves for α,β-meATP. It enhanced the maximal current amplitudes (Imax), increased the EC50 values, and raised the Hill coefficient (nH; Fig. 1Ba and Table 1). In contrast, the alkalinization of the extracellular solution caused no major change in the Imax, the EC50 value or the nH (Fig. 1Bb; Table 1).TABLE 1Parameters of the α,β-meATP concentration-response relations and the t50 values of the recovery from α,β-meATP-induced desensitization for human P2X3 receptors permanently transfected into HEK293 cells at various pH levelspHImaxnHEC50t50pAμmmin8.63945 ± 4881.38 ± 0.291.13 ± 0.29NDaND, not determined.83935 ± 481.54 ± 0.050.66 ± 0.021.19 ± 0.057.43183 ± 1631.75 ± 0.240.77 ± 0.081.01 ± 0.076.45075 ± 703bp < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (one way analysis of variance).1.55 ± 0.491.74 ± 0.5bp < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (one way analysis of variance).0.74 ± 0.175.84302 ± 312.88 ± 0.09bp < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (one way analysis of variance).1.67 ± 0.02bp < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (one way analysis of variance).0.42 ± 0.03bp < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (one way analysis of variance).a ND, not determined.b p < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (one way analysis of variance). Open table in a new tab To further investigate the effect of protons on P2X3 receptors, we applied two selected agonist concentrations (1 and 4.64 μm) onto HEK293-hP2X3 cells and examined, whether a change in the pH affects P2X3 currents in the same cell. As shown in Fig. 2, the current amplitudes evoked by α,β-meATP at 1 μm (approximate EC50) were inhibited by shifting the pH from 7.4 to 5.8 by 43.7 ± 7.6% (n = 10, p < 0.05) whereas at 4.64 μm (high concentration of this agonist), the current amplitudes were facilitated by 28.9 ± 14.0% (n = 8, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). Both the increase and the decrease of the current responses to these α,β-meATP concentrations were reversible on returning to the original extracellular pH of 7.4. In contrast, a change of the pH from 7.4 to 8.0 did not modify the α,β-meATP currents at either concentration (1.4 ± 6.3%, n = 6 and 1.8 ± 8.6%, n = 6, at 1 and 4.64 μm, respectively) (Fig. 2B). The original tracings in Fig. 2, A and B show that acidification, but not alkalinization itself induces rapidly declining inward currents. These currents may be due to the activation of ASICs described to be present in HEK293 cells (31Lalo U. Pankratov Y. North R.A. Verkhratsky A. J. Cell Physiol. 2007; 212: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As documented in Fig. 2, Aa and Ab, these currents completely desensitized within milliseconds, and therefore they are not expected to alter the currents evoked by α,β-meATP 2.5-min later. Nonetheless, to reliably exclude a possible interference of ASIC currents with α,β-meATP-induced currents, the same experiments as shown in Fig. 2A were performed in the presence of amiloride, a selective inhibitor of ASIC channels (14Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 578-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In fact, amiloride (200 μm) abolished the early current induced by a change of pH from 7.4 to 5.8 (96.5 ± 2.7% inhibition, n = 5, p < 0.05%), but had no effect on the response to α,β-meATP (1 μm) at a pH of 5.8 (40.3 ± 9.6% inhibition, n = 5, p > 0.05%; compare with Fig. 2Ac). It is noteworthy that the lower concentration (1 μm) of α,β-meATP evoked a current response at a pH of 5.8, which desensitized much slower than that observed at the control pH value of 7.4 (Fig. 2Aa; see below). Effect of Protons on P2X3 Receptor Activation and Desensitization—Next, we investigated whether different proton concentrations affect the activation and desensitization of P2X3 channels. The current decay in the presence of α,β-meATP, which represents the onset of desensitization, was fitted by a biexponential equation (see “Materials and Methods”) and had a first fast and a second slow time constant (τdes1, τdes2). Of these time constants, τdes1 was found to be the more dominant one, because it constituted concentration-independently 84.9 ± 1.4% of the current decay, as calculated from the contribution of the relative amplitudes of the first and second exponential to the total current amplitude (A1/A1+A2, see Equation 2 under “Materials and Methods”; n = 39). The activation time constants (τon) and both desensitization time constants (τdes1, τdes2) inversely correlated with the α,β-meATP concentration (Fig. 3, Ca–Cc). These data are in accordance with earlier observations showing that the kinetics of activation, desensitization, and recovery from desensitization, but not deactivation of P2X receptors, inversely correlate with the agonist concentration (32Zemkova H. He M.L. Koshimizu T.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6968-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Sokolova E. Skorinkin A. Moiseev I. Agrachev A. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Yan Z. Liang Z. Obsil T. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32649-32659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Lowering the pH to 5.8 increased both the activation time constant and the two desensitization time constants at all agonist concentrations applied (Fig. 3, A, B, and Ca–Cc). Increasing the pH value up to 8.6 did not change the activation and desensitization time constants appreciably. The normalized shift of concentration time constant curves at different pH values is shown in Fig. 3D. As shown in Fig. 3Cb, the pH-dependent amplification of τdes2 (but not τdes1; Fig. 3Ca) was attenuated at higher agonist concentrations. We calculated the contribution of τdes2 to the current decay at different pH and agonist concentrations and found that τdes2 was independent of these parameters and constituted only 16.3 ± 3.4% (n = 38) of the total current decay. It is interesting to note that the concentration versus τon curves were less steep than the concentration versus τdes1 curves. Thus at lower concentrations of α,β-meATP the current amplitude was determined mostly by the activation time constant, whereas at higher concentrations of α,β-meATP the current amplitude was determined mostly by the first time constant of desensitization (Fig. 3, Ca and Cc). Effect of Protons on the Recovery from Desensitization—After rapid desensitization, P2X3 receptors stay in the desensitized state for minutes and cannot fully open in response to further agonist application. We next examined the availability of the receptors after different time intervals i.e. how fast they recover from this desensitized state and, moreover, whether changing the proton concentration modulates this process. HEK293-hP2X3 cells were stimulated repetitively with α,β-meATP (10 μm, for 5 s), by progressively increasing the interpulse intervals (Fig. 4). During the application of α,β-meATP, P2X3 receptors completely desensitized. The recovery of P2X3 receptors from desensitization exhibited a sigmoidal time course and was best fitted with Equation 3 described under “Materials and Methods.” The time course of recovery was expressed as t50, namely the time to regain 50% of the maximally recovered current amplitudes. Lowering the pH to 5.8 significantly accelerated the recovery (Table 1; analysis of variance, p < 0.05, n = 7–8), whereas increasing the pH to 8.0 had no effect on the speed of recovery (Table 1). The Role of Histidine Residues in pH Sensitivity—Protons modulated P2X3 receptors in the range between pH 7.4 and 5.8. The only amino acid with a pKa close to this range is histidine. The pKa of free histidine is 6.0 (35Tanokura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but in proteins its pKa can range from 5.0 to 8.0 (36Kao Y.H. Fitch C.A. Bhattacharya S. Sarkisian C.J. Lecomte J.T. Garcia-Moreno E.B. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1637-1654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) making histidines apparent candidates for the proton-binding site. To test whether histidines are involved in the modulation of P2X3 receptors by protons, we substituted single histidine residues by alanines in the extracellular domain of the human P2X3 receptor (H45A and H206A). The wild-type (WT) P2X3 receptors transiently transfected into HEK293 cells responded to acidification in a manner similar to that reported for the permanently transfected receptor (compare Tables 1 and 2). In fact, lowering the pH from 7.4 to 5.8 shifted the concentration-response curve for α,β-meATP to the right and increased the Imax (Fig. 5, Aa and Ab). We investigated the effect of replacing two histidine residues in the extracellular loop of the P2X3 receptor by the uncharged amino acid alanine (H45A, H206A) on the pH sensitivity of the α,β-meATP effect (Fig. 5B and Table 2). The most important finding is that the H206A mutation abolished the increase of the maximal response, the shift of the concentration-response curve to the right, and the changes in all three kinetic parameters (τdes1, τdes2, and τon) by acidification to a pH of 5.8 (Fig. 5, Ba and C). In contrast, the single mutation H45A, accentuated the pH-sensitivity of the receptor; both the increase of the maximal response and the rightward shift of the concentration-response curve were more pronounced than in the case of the WT receptor (Fig. 5Bb). The effects of acidification on the τon, τdes1, and τdes2 were similar to that observed with the WT receptor (Fig. 5, Ca, Cb, Cc). The double mutant caused a mixture of these effects in that although a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve by the acidic pH was still present, the increase in Imax and a change in the kinetic parameters of desensitization were abolished (Fig. 5, Bc and C).TABLE 2Parameters of the α,β-meATP concentration-response relations for wild type and mutated human P2X3 receptors transiently transfected into HEK293 cells at various pH levelspHImaxnHEC50pAμmWT7.43399 ± 331.78 ± 0.091.89 ± 0.065.84985 ± 220ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (Student’s t-test).1.71 ± 0.358.58 ± 1.20ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (Student’s t-test).H206A7.41345 ± 371.98 ± 0.233.48 ± 0.245.81504 ± 481.64 ± 0.227.24 ± 0.70ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (Student’s t-test).H45A7.4948 ± 401.94 ± 0.300.46 ± 0.045.81633 ± 120ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (Student’s t-test).2.23 ± 0.504.50 ± 0.57ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (Student’s t-test).DMbDM, double mutant (H206A-H45A).7.4242 ± 131.55 ± 0.314.38 ± 0.725.8225 ± 42.20 ± 0.1915.41 ± 0.80ap < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (Student’s t-test).a p < 0.05, statistically significant difference from pH 7.4 (Student’s t-test).b DM, double mutant (H206A-H45A).

https://openalex.org/W2077177477,"Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) has been shown to correct the cellular trafficking of several mutant or nonmutant plasma membrane proteins such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator through the expression of 70-kDa heat shock proteins. The objective of the study was to determine whether 4-PBA may influence the functional expression of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC). Using primary cultures of HNEC, we demonstrate that 4-PBA (5 mm for 6 h) markedly stimulated amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity and that this was related to an increased abundance of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits in the apical membrane. The increase in ENaC cell surface expression (i) was due to insertion of newly ENaC subunits as determined by brefeldin A experiments and (ii) was not associated with cell surface retention of ENaC subunits because endocytosis of ENaC subunits was unchanged. In addition, we find that ENaC co-immunoprecipitated with the heat shock protein constituvely expressed Hsc70, that has been reported to modulate ENaC trafficking, and that 4-PBA decreased Hsc70 protein level. Finally, we report that in cystic fibrosis HNEC obtained from two cystic fibrosis patients, 4-PBA increased functional expression of ENaC as demonstrated by the increase in amiloride-sensitive sodium transport and in α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunit expression in the apical membrane. Our results suggest that in HNEC, 4-PBA increases the functional expression of ENaC through the insertion of new α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits into the apical membrane and also suggest that 4-PBA could modify ENaC trafficking by reducing Hsc70 protein expression.

Olivier K. Noone P. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: S65-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In airway epithelial cells, sodium enters the apical membrane mainly through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). ENaC and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are co-localized at the apical surface of respiratory epithelia where CFTR can regulate ENaC activity (2Huang P. Gilmore E. Kultgen P. Barnes P. Milgram S. Stutts M.J. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2004; 1: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Nagel G. Barbry P. Chabot H. Brochiero E. Hartung K. Grygorczyk R. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The activity of ENaC appears increased in cystic fibrosis (CF) compared with non-CF airway epithelia, which likely leads to enhanced absorption of water from the ASL (4Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The role of ENaC in ASL volume regulation was recently confirmed by Mall et al. (5Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), who showed that airway-targeted overexpression of β-ENaC in mouse airways increased in vivo sodium absorption, caused ASL volume depletion, and initiated a cystic fibrosis-like lung disease. Thus, the regulation of ENaC expression and activity is likely to be critical in airway homeostasis. Relatively little is known about the regulation of ENaC processing, trafficking, and stability at the cell surface of airway epithelial cells under physiological or pathological conditions. Recent studies indicate that ENaC intracellular trafficking shares some similarities with CFTR maturation: both channels are processed inefficiently with only a small fraction of newly synthesized proteins reaching the membrane, and the major fraction is targeted for intracellular degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (6Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Such degradation depends in part on the constitutively expressed 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsc70), which is an essential factor for ubiquitination (7Goldfarb S.B. Kashlan O.B. Watkins J.N. Suaud L. Yan W. Kleyman T.R. Rubenstein R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5817-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) has been shown to function as a chemical chaperone that can correct the cellular trafficking of misfolded mutant ΔF508-CFTR plasma proteins leading to increased cell surface expression and enhanced chloride flux (8Rubenstein R.C. Egan M.E. Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Also, 4-PBA was shown to increase cell surface expression of non mutant proteins such as Na,K-ATPase, but paradoxically 4-PBA did not change or even decreased Na,K-ATPase activity in epithelial cell lines (9Riordan M. Sreedharan R. Wang S. Thulin G. Mann A. Stankewich M. Van Why S. Kashgarian M. Siegel N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F1236-F1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which 4-PBA elicits proper maturation of mutant and non mutant proteins remain unclear. Several studies have reported that 4-PBA reduced the expression of Hsc70 in CF epithelial cells (10Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C259-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to a decrease in Hsc70-ΔF508 CFTR association and therefore to a decrease in ΔF508 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (7Goldfarb S.B. Kashlan O.B. Watkins J.N. Suaud L. Yan W. Kleyman T.R. Rubenstein R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5817-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date, the effect of 4-PBA on the expression and function of ENaC in native human epithelial cells has not been evaluated. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether 4-PBA can modulate ENaC cell surface expression and activity in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) and to evaluate the mechanisms involved in this effect. The results indicate that 4-PBA increased apical cell surface expression of ENaC and concomitantly enhanced amiloride-sensitive sodium transport in HNEC. 4-PBA-induced increase in ENaC expression in the apical membrane was due rather to insertion of new sodium channels from the cellular pool than to an increase in ENaC cell surface retention and likely involved 4-PBA-induced modulation of Hsc70. Primary Cultures of HNEC—Nasal polyps were obtained from non-CF (n = 20) requiring surgery for their nasal polyposis as previously described (11Pruliere-Escabasse V. Fanen P. Dazy A.C. Lechapt-Zalcman E. Rideau D. Edelman A. Escudier E. Coste A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L77-L83Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, nasal polyps were also obtained in two CF (ΔF508/ΔF508) patients. The diagnosis of nasal polyposis was established on the basis of clinical history, endoscopic findings, and computed tomography results. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and ethics committee of our institution (CCPPRB, Hôpital Henri Mondor), and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Nasal polyp samples were immediately placed in DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml of amphotericin B, and 100 mg/ml of gentamicin) and transported to the laboratory for cell isolation. Briefly, nasal polyp samples were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with dithiothreitol (5 nm) and antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml of amphotericin B, and 100 mg/ml of gentamicin) and then placed overnight at 4 °C in a PBS antibiotics solution containing 0.1% Pronase. The samples were incubated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 with 5% fetal calf serum before centrifugation (1,500 rpm, 7 min). The cell pellets were then suspended in 0.25% EDTA solution for 3 min and incubated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 antibiotics with 10% fetal calf serum. Finally, HNEC were plated on permeable polycarbonate supports Transwell® or Snapwell® (Costar, Cambridge, MA) (1 × 106cells/cm2) for short circuit current measurements. All inserts had a diameter of 12-mm and were coated with type IV collagen. HNEC were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For the first 24 h, HNEC were incubated with 1 ml of DMEM/Ham's F-12 antibiotics with 2% Ultroser G outside the insert and DMEM/Ham's F-12 antibiotics with 10% fetal calf serum inside the insert. After 24 h, the medium was removed inside the inserts to place the cells at an air-liquid interface, and the medium outside the inserts was then changed daily. Transepithelial resistance and transepithelial potential difference were measured every 3 days using a microvoltmeter (World Precision Instruments, Astonbury, UK). Treatment of HNEC Cultures with 4-PBA—The effects of 4-PBA in HNEC cultures on Transwell or Snapwell inserts were evaluated between days 10 and 14. The cells were treated with 5 mm of 4-PBA added to the basolateral side or with vehicle (control cells) for increasing periods of time (3, 6, or 24 h). Electrophysiological Studies—Measurements of short circuit current (Isc), transepithelial potential difference, and transepithelial resistance (Rte) were performed in cells treated with 5 mm 4-PBA or the vehicle for 3, 6, or 24 h as previously described (12Planes C. Leyvraz C. Uchida T. Angelova M.A. Vuagniaux G. Hummler E. Matthay M. Clerici C. Rossier B. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L1099-L1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Snapwell inserts were mounted in vertical diffusion chambers and were bathed with Ringer solution (pH 7.4) continuously bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. The apical and basolateral chambers were filled with 137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.9 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5.9 mm CH3COONa, 1.3 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose. Potential difference was short circuited to 0 mV with a voltage clamp (World Precision Instruments, Astonbury, UK) connected to the apical and basolateral chambers via Ag-AgCl electrodes and agar bridges to measure Isc. Rte was calculated by Ohm's law. Isc was allowed to stabilize, before adding the drugs. Amiloride (10–4 m) was applied to the apical solution to calculate the amiloride-sensitive part of Isc (Isc amil), which is the difference between Isc measured in the absence and presence of amiloride. Amiloride-treated HNEC were then stimulated with forskolin (10–5 m, basolateral side) and IBMX (104 m, basolateral side) to induce cAMP-dependent Cl– secretion (Isc IBMX+forsk). Isc IBMX+forsk was the difference between the initial value of Isc and the peak value obtained in response to drug addition. Experiments were also undertaken to measure sodium influx through apical amiloride-sensitive channels in basolaterally permeabilized cells, as previously described (13Planes C. Blot-Chabaud M. Matthay M.A. Couette S. Uchida T. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47318-47324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). HNEC were bathed with an apical compartment solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and a basolateral compartment solution containing 25 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and 110 mm methyl-d-glucamine (an impermeant cation) for 15 min, before the basolateral membrane was permeabilized by the basolateral addition of amphotericin B (10 μm), a monovalent ionophore. This induced a rapid increase in Isc. Once the Isc reached a new steady state, amiloride (10–4 m) was added to the apical bathing solution, and the difference current, representing the amiloride-sensitive component of the sodium current across the apical membrane (Isc ampho,amil), was calculated. Western Blot Experiments—Cells in Transwell filters were treated with or without 4-PBA (5 mm for 6 h), washed twice, scraped off the filters in ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors and kept on ice for 1 h. The cell lysates were then centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 15 min) at 4 °C. Samples of the supernatants (10–15 μg of protein in 1 volume sample buffer containing 10% glycerol, 12.5% 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 5% β-mer-captoethanol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) were resolved through 10% acrylamide gels, electroblotted, electrically transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and subsequently probed for the α-, β-, or γ-ENaC subunits. Rabbit polyclonal ENaC antibody directed against human α-ENaC N terminus (AA20–42) (Affinity Bio Reagents, St Quentin en Yvelines, France) (14Rochat T. Lacroix J.S. Jornot L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 201: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used at 1:1000 dilution, rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-β-rat ENaC (rENaC) and anti-γ-rat ENaC (15Duc C. Farman N. Canessa C.M. Bonvalet J.P. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1907-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) were used at 1:3000 dilution, and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (Chemicon, France) was used at 1:1000 dilution. The cross-reactivity of anti-rENaC antibodies against hENaC has been previously demonstrated (16Brouard M. Casado M. Djelidi S. Barrandon Y. Farman N. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3343-3352PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of Hsp70 and Hsc70 protein expression in HNEC, mouse anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibody and rat anti-Hsc70 monoclonal antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) were used at 1:3000 dilution. The specificity of Hsp70 and Hsc70 antibodies has been previously established by immunoblotting (10Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C259-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Donkey anti-rabbit, anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at dilutions of 1:5000, 1:6000, and 1:3000, respectively. The signal was developed with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of ENaC and GAPDH levels was obtained using Scion Image Software. Biotinylation of Apical Human ENaC Subunits—Biotinylation and recovery of apical membrane proteins were performed as previously described (13Planes C. Blot-Chabaud M. Matthay M.A. Couette S. Uchida T. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47318-47324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, HNEC grown on Transwell filters were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ (PBS with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2). Eight filter inserts were combined for each experimental point (200 μg of cell lysates). Apical membrane proteins were biotinylated by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C with NHS-ss-biotin 1.25 mg/ml (Pierce) freshly diluted into biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) with gentle agitation. HNEC were rinsed with PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ with glycine (100 mm) and washed in this buffer for 20 min at 4 °C to quench unreacted biotin. HNEC were then rinsed twice with PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+, scraped in cold PBS, and pelleted at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were solubilized for 45 min in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing protein inhibitors. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated overnight with packed streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) to recover biotinylated proteins. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation, and aliquots of supernatants were taken to represent the unbound, intracellular pool of proteins. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating to 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer as described above. Biotinylated proteins and 60 μg of intracellular cell lysates were loaded on the same gel. To ensure the absence of leakage of biotin into the cell, an internal control was used for each experimental condition by measuring surface biotinylation of an intracellular protein (GAPDH). Only the experiments showing no labeling of intracellular proteins (i.e. no leakage of biotin) were included in our analysis. Quantification of biotinylated α-, β-, and γ-ENaC signals was obtained using Scion Image Software, and the data were normalized for GAPDH signal in the corresponding intracellular extracts. Brefeldin A Treatment—To prevent ENaC protein transport to cell surface during 4-PBA treatment, we treated HNEC with brefeldin A (10 μg/ml), a blocker of transport from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface (17Low S.H. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). HNEC were incubated with 4-PBA for 6 h, and brefeldin A was added basolaterally 3 h after starting 4-PBA stimulation. Then amiloride-sensitive current was measured by short circuit measurement, and α-, β- and γ-ENaC subunit cell surface expression was assessed by biotinylation of apical membrane proteins. Measurement of ENaC Internalization—Estimation of ENaC subunit internalization was performed with a method adapted from Gonin et al. (19Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HNEC were incubated in the presence or absence of 4-PBA for 6 h and then biotinylated on ice for 30 min as described above. The cells were subsequently returned to 37 °C to allow the internalization of biotinylated apical membrane proteins. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, biotin remaining at the apical surface was stripped off by rinsing HNEC four times with a reducing solution (50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MES-Na, and 25 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) for 10 min at 4 °C. After cell lysis, the internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated, washed, eluted from streptavidin beads, electrophoresed, and Western blotted as described above. In the negative control, biotin was stripped off immediately after biotinylation. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—HNEC were washed twice with 1 ml of cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mix. The lysates (100 μg/ml) were centrifuged at 14 000 × g for 20 min, and the pellets were discarded. The supernatants were incubated with either 5 μg of anti-α-ENaC antibody (Affinity BioReagents) or 5 μg of anti-Hsc70 antibody (Stressgen) at 4 °C overnight (final volume, 500 μl). Subsequently, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the co-immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling the samples at 95 °C for 5 min. The Sepharose beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting (10% SDS-PAGE gel) as described above using anti-α-ENaC or anti-Hsc70 antibodies. Specificity of the polyclonal anti α-ENaC antibody was verified by preincubating the antibody with its immunizing peptide (Affinity BioReagents) (2 μg of peptide/1 μg of α-ENaC antibody) for 15 h before immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—The data from short circuit measurements are presented as the means ± S.E. The data from short circuit measurements were compared between HNEC cultured with or without 4-PBA with a Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. For Western blot experiments, differences between each group were evaluated with paired t tests. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Reagents—Ham's F-12 nutrient medium with DMEM, penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, fetal calf serum, trypsin, EDTA, and Ultroser G were purchased from Invitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Dithiothreitol, Pronase, gentamicin, collagen IV, amiloride, forskolin, and IBMX were obtained from Sigma (Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). 4-PBA was obtained from Calbiochem (Strasbourg, France). Effect of 4-PBA on Amiloride-sensitive and cAMP-dependent Currents in HNEC—We evaluated the effects of 4-PBA on ion transports in HNEC grown on Snapwell filters by electrophysiological studies. Short circuit current measurements were performed after basolateral addition of 4-PBA for 3, 6, or 24 h and compared with controls. The mean electrophysiologic values obtained from HNEC monolayers exposed or not to 4-PBA are given in Table 1. 4-PBA significantly increased Isc, Isc amil, and Isc IBMX+forsk at 6 and 24 h of incubation whereas 3 h of incubation had no effect. PBA affected neither amiloride-insensitive component of Isc nor Rte when compared with controls. To determine whether 4-PBA-induced increase in sodium transport was related to enhanced apical sodium channel activity, Isc was measured after permeabilization of the basolateral membrane with amphotericin B (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1A, addition of amphotericin B to the basolateral bath rapidly increased Isc to a peak value (Isc ampho, max). The amiloride-sensitive part of this current (Isc ampho,amil), reflecting sodium influx through the apical amiloride-sensitive channels, was significantly increased in HNEC exposed to 4-PBA for 6 h, as compared with controls (85.1 ± 15.2 μA/cm2 versus 42.1 ± 12.4 μA/cm2; p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Effect of 4-PBA on bioelectric measurements in HNEC cultured at air-liquid interfaceConditionRtePotential differenceBasal IscIsc amilIsc IBMX + ForskΩ·cm2mVμA/cm2μA/cm2μA/cm2Controls923 ± 9936.9 ± 4.247.7 ± 6.132.5 ± 5.48.5 ± 1.54-PBA (3 h)1128 ± 15444.6 ± 3.544.6 ± 5.937.7 ± 5.710.0 ± 0.94-PBA (6 h)950 ± 11246.1 ± 4.2aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).68.3 ± 8.8aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).62.6 ± 7.2bSignificantly different from control (p < 0.01).15.1 ± 1.5aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).4-PBA (24 h)1157 ± 13677.4 ± 3.4aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).100.4 ± 5.4aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).97.1 ± 6.0bSignificantly different from control (p < 0.01).18.2 ± 1.6aSignificantly different from control (p < 0.05).a Significantly different from control (p < 0.05).b Significantly different from control (p < 0.01). Open table in a new tab Effect of 4-PBA on ENaC Subunit Protein Levels in HNEC— To evaluate whether the 4-PBA-induced increase in ENaC function was associated with change in α-, β-, and γ-ENaC protein expression, ENaC subunit protein levels were determined by Western blot experiments in whole HNEC extracts. The anti-α-ENaC antibody revealed two bands, a main band at 85 kDa and a smaller band that migrated at 65 kDa (Fig. 2A). In contrast to a recent study, using a N terminus α-ENaC antibody, no band was detected at 30 kDa (20Ergonul Z. Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F683-F693Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, our result is in line with a study in primary human airway epithelial cells that failed to detect this band using another N terminus antibody (21Myerburg M.M. Butterworth M.B. McKenna E.E. Peters K.W. Frizzell R.A. Kleyman T.R. Pilewski J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27942-27949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The β-ENaC protein was detected as a single main band that migrated at 95 kDa. The γ-ENaC was detected as two bands that migrated to 85 and 75 kDa (Fig. 2A). Treatment with 4-PBA (5 mm for 6 h) did not change the protein levels of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC (normalized to the corresponding GAPDH signal) (Fig. 2B). Effect of 4-PBA on the Abundance of ENaC Subunits Expressed at the Cell Surface in HNEC—Biotinylation of HNEC apical membranes was used to estimate whether 4-PBA treatment could modify cell surface expression of the three ENaC subunits. The biotinylated α-ENaC subunit protein was detected as a single band of 65 kDa, as previously reported in A6 cells derived from Xenopus laevis kidney (22Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and in cultured rat alveolar epithelial type II (13Planes C. Blot-Chabaud M. Matthay M.A. Couette S. Uchida T. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47318-47324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Crude estimation revealed that the relative amount of α-ENaC protein expressed at the apical membrane of HNEC represented ∼13% of total α-ENaC pool. Biotinylated β- and γ-ENaC proteins were detected as one and two bands, respectively, with molecular masses similar to the signals obtained in corresponding intracellular extracts (Fig. 3A). The relative amount of biotinylated β-ENaC and γ-ENaC expressed at the cell membrane represented ∼12 and ∼10% of total β-ENaC and γ-ENaC cellular pools, respectively. Exposure to 4-PBA significantly increased the amount of biotinylated α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits, as compared with control condition (1.85-, 2.2-, and 1.97-fold increase, respectively) (Fig. 3B). The increase in α-, β-, and γ-ENaC cell surface expression was not associated with significant change in ENaC protein levels in intracellular cell extracts. The relative abundance of ENaC proteins in intracellular extracts from control and PBA-treated cells was: 1.00 ± 0.31 versus 1.03 ± 0.33 for α-ENaC (not significant), 1.00 ± 0.10 versus 1.03 ± 0.15 for β-ENaC (not significant), and 1.00 ± 0.13 versus 0.98 ± 0.20 for γ-ENaC (not significant) (n = 6–7 independent experiments). Effect of Brefeldin A on 4-PBA-induced Increase in ENaC Subunit Cell Surface Expression and Sodium Transport in HNEC—To determine whether the effect of 4-PBA on α-, β-, and γ-ENaC expression at the cell surface was related to their translocation from cytoplasmic storage to the plasma membrane, we tested the effect of brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite that inhibits intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface (17Low S.H. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.H. J.

Here we show that a cis-acting element, the Hsp83 degradation element (HDE), within the 3′-untranslated region of the Drosophila Hsp83 mRNA functions as a translational enhancer. We show that this element is bound by a multiprotein complex, and we identify components using a novel affinity-based method called tandem RNA affinity purification tagging. Three proteins (DDP1, Hrp48, and poly(A)-binding protein) are components of the HDE-binding complex and function in translational enhancement. Our data support a model whereby the HDE is composed of several cis-acting subelements that represent binding sites for trans-acting factors, and the combined action of these trans-acting factors underlies the ability of the HDE to stimulate translation.

Regulated translation plays an essential role in a wide variety of cellular processes. Although translational regulation is likely to function in virtually all eukaryotic cell types, these controls are particularly important in cells where transcriptional regulation is not an option. For example, maturation of mammalian red blood cells occurs after the nucleus is extruded and thus is driven by previously synthesized mRNAs. Similarly, in early metazoan embryos, the zygotic genome is transcriptionally silent, and maternally deposited mRNAs control early development. Translational regulation is also very important in large cells, such as neurons, where correct spatial and temporal expression of proteins cannot be achieved through transcriptional controls alone. Regulation of specific transcripts is often mediated by cisacting elements within the 5′-or3′-untranslated region (UTR) 4The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; HDE, Hsp83 degradation element; TRAP, tandem RNA affinity purification; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. of an mRNA (1Hentze M.W. Gebauer F. Preiss T. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 269-295Google Scholar). These elements can act as binding sites for trans-acting factors that either directly or indirectly contact the translational machinery. Some of the best characterized mechanisms serve to repress protein expression, but mechanisms that stimulate protein production also exist. In principle, these positively acting events can be divided into two different classes. The first acts on transcripts that are translationally repressed. Translational stimulation is achieved by blocking the repressive mechanism (i.e. enhancement results from relief of repression). The second class of stimulatory events acts on mRNAs that are not repressed. In these cases, an mRNA is better able to recruit the basic translation machinery and is, therefore, expressed at a higher level. This latter type of mechanism is likely to be particularly important when a component of the translation machinery is limiting and, consequently, transcripts must compete for access to the translational apparatus. Many viral RNAs contain elements that aid in preferential expression in infected cells. For example, the 5′-UTR of the tobacco mosaic virus RNA contains a cis-acting element, Ω, that is bound by Hsp101, which in turn recruits the eIF4F translation initiation complex to the RNA to enhance its translation (2Wells D.R.

Examples of cellular mRNAs that carry cis-acting translational enhancers have also been described, but, for the most part, the molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. One well characterized example involves metazoan histone mRNAs, which terminate in a stem-loop structure and do not carry a poly(A) tail. The stem-loop is bound by the stem-loop-binding protein which interacts directly with the translation initiation factors, eIF4G and eIF3 (4Jaeger S. Barends S. Giege R. Eriani G. Martin F. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stem-loop-binding protein has an analogous function to poly(A)-binding protein (PABP); both bind to the 3′ end of the transcript and interact with the translation initiation machinery to facilitate protein synthesis (1Hentze M.W. Gebauer F. Preiss T. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. Translational Control in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2007: 269-295Google Scholar). PABP can also bind to cis-acting sequences that are outside the poly(A) tail. The mammalian YB-1 RNA, for example, carries a PABP binding sequence within its 3′-UTR (5Skabkina O.V. Skabkin M.A. Popova N.V. Lyabin D.N. Penalva L.O. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18191-18198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By binding to this element, PABP enhances translation of YB-1 RNA in a poly(A) tail-independent manner. Previous work provided indirect evidence that the Drosophila Hsp83 mRNA contains a translational enhancer in its 3′-UTR that functions in the early embryo (6Bashirullah A. Halsell S.R. Cooperstock R.L. Kloc M. Karaiskakis A. Fisher W.W. Fu W. Hamilton J.K. Etkin L.D. Lipshitz H.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The Hsp83 transcript is regulated through multiple mechanisms. The RNA is localized to the posterior of the embryo by selective degradation of the transcript in the bulk cytoplasm of the embryo, whereas transcripts present in the germ plasm at the posterior are protected. A region of the 3′-UTR, termed the Hsp83 degradation element (HDE), was originally identified through its ability to direct the degradation of transgenic mRNAs. Expression of one of the mRNAs results in embryonic defects, which were enhanced when the HDE is present in the reporter mRNA 3′-UTR, suggesting that the HDE might stimulate translation. To obtain direct evidence that the HDE functions as a translational enhancer and to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved, we developed a microinjection-based assay that recapitulates HDE-mediated translational enhancement in Drosophila embryos. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the HDE contains multiple subelements capable of mediating translational enhancement. To identify trans-acting factors that act through the HDE, we developed a widely applicable method to identify proteins that bind to RNA sequences of interest, which we call tandem RNA affinity purification (TRAP) tagging. Using several approaches, including TRAP tagging, we identified three proteins (DDP1, Hrp48, and PABP) that bind to the HDE as part of a protein complex. We show that both DDP1 and Hrp48 function in translational enhancement. Although previous work indicated that Hrp48 functions as a translational repressor, our data suggest that Hrp48 is a bifunctional modulator of translation and that the ability of Hrp48 to act as a repressor or activator is regulated by other proteins that are recruited to the target mRNA. We propose that the HDE is a modular element composed of several cis-acting sequences representing binding sites for various factors that regulate translation. Thus, HDE-mediated translational enhancement is a read-out of the combined action of its associated trans-acting factors. RNA Injection Assay—Luciferase RNAs were generated as described previously (7Smibert C.A. Lie Y.S. Shillinglaw W. Henzel W.J. Macdonald P.M. RNA. 1999; 5: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Injection experiments were performed as described by Nelson et al. (8Nelson M.R. Leidal A.M. Smibert C.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Wild-type embryos were collected from w1118 mothers, and hrp48 germ line clones were generated for hrp4802647 and hrp4810280 mutant alleles (9Hammond L.E. Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using established techniques (10Chou T.-B. Perrimon N. Genetics. 1992; 131: 643-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase RNAs were injected at a concentration of 200 and 50 ng/μl, respectively. Injected embryos were harvested 3.0–3.5 h after egg laying. Translational enhancement for RNAs bearing 3′-UTR inserts were expressed as its corrected value divided by the corrected value from firefly RNA carrying no insert. For example, the translational enhancement of luc-HDE-(1–97) RNA = (firefly activity of luc-HDE-(1–97)/Renilla activity)/(firefly activity of luciferase RNA carrying no insert/Renilla activity). Embryo Extract Preparation—All experiments employed extract prepared by collecting embryos 0–2 h after egg laying from w1118 animals. Embryos were disrupted in a minimal volume of 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/μl leupeptin, 2 μg/μl pepstatin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation, the supernatant was supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) and stored at –80 °C. RNA-binding Assays—Gel electromobility shift reactions contained 10 μg of tRNA, 0.1 μg of heparin, 1 μl of RNasin (Promega), 4 μl of 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 × 106 cpm probe RNA, and 1 μl of embryo extract. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and run on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. UV cross-linking assays employed 2.5 × 106 cpm of probe RNA, 0.5 μl of embryo extract, 10 μg of tRNA, 10 μg of heparin, 4.5 μl of 40 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 43% glycerol, all in a final volume of 10 μl. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and UV-irradiated as previously described (12Smibert C.A. Wilson J.E. Kerr K. Macdonald P.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2600-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), followed by the addition of 5 μg of RNase A (Fermentas) and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Proteins were then electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and labeled proteins were visualized by phosphorimaging. Where indicated, gel shift reactions were immunoprecipitated with anti-DDP1 antibody, which was raised in guinea pigs by Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. against residues 1–650 of the DDP1 protein, anti-PABP antibody (13Roy G. Miron M. Khaleghpour K. Lasko P. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1143-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), anti-Hrp48 antibody (9Hammond L.E. Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), or anti-Smaug antibody (7Smibert C.A. Lie Y.S. Shillinglaw W. Henzel W.J. Macdonald P.M. RNA. 1999; 5: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For gel shift assays that were to be followed by UV cross-linking, gel shift reactions were performed, and the shifted complex was cross-linked as described above. Gel slices were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 150 NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Fermentas). Nonidet P-40, sodium deoxycolate, and SDS were then added to final concentrations of 1, 1, and 0.1%, respectively, and incubated at 30 °C overnight. TRAP—TRAP-tagged RNAs, containing a 5′ S1 aptamer (14Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. RNA. 2001; 7: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. Methods. 2002; 26: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), followed by two MS2 coat protein binding sites (16Hirao I. Spingola M. Peabody D. Ellington A.D. Mol. Divers. 1998; 4: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the bait sequence of interest, were generated via in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. 40 μg of TRAP-tagged RNA was mixed with 40 μl of streptavidin resin (Sigma) in 100 μlof TBP (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) for 1 h at 4°C. The resin was washed extensively with TBP. Embryo extract was supplemented with Triton X-100 to 0.1% and 5 μg of soluble Avidin (Sigma)/mg of protein and then held on ice for 20 min. The extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed and mixed with RNA/streptavidin resin for 2 h at 4°C. After extensive washing with TBP, RNA was eluted with 100 μl of TBP plus 5 mm biotin. The eluate was mixed for 2 h at 4°C with 20 μlof glutathione resin carrying 2 mg/ml GST-MS2 coat protein. The resin was then washed extensively with TBP, and proteins were eluted in 35 μl of TBP + 0.25 μg of RNaseA/T1 mix (2 mg/ml and 5000 units/ml, respectively) (Fermentas) for 1 h at 4°C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with silver. Protein bands were cut from the gel and identified via mass spectrometry. The HDE Functions as a Translational Enhancer in Drosophila Embryos—To prove that the HDE functions as a translational enhancer and to investigate the mechanism involved, we developed a convenient microinjection-based assay that recapitulates translational enhancement in a manner similar to assays previously developed to study translational repression (8Nelson M.R. Leidal A.M. Smibert C.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Chagnovich D. Lehmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11359-11364Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We reasoned that insertion of the HDE into a reporter RNA would enhance its translation relative to that of the reporter lacking the HDE. The capped reporter RNAs contained the firefly luciferase open reading frame and a 30-nucleotide-long poly(A) tail. To control for variables such as the amount of RNA injected and the efficiency of embryo homogenization, an unregulated RNA encoding Renilla luciferase was co-injected with each firefly luciferase reporter RNA. The two luciferase enzymes have different substrate requirements, allowing us to distinguish, quantify, and compare the activities of each enzyme in the same sample. The level of firefly activity was thus normalized to that of the Renilla enzyme. When the reporter RNA carried an intact 97-nucleotide-long HDE (luc-HDE-(1–97)), it directed a 14-fold increase in normalized luciferase expression relative to reporter RNA carrying no insert (Fig. 1). Nucleotides 1–250 and 347–404 of the Hsp83 3′-UTR, which account for the rest of the 3′UTR, failed to enhance luciferase expression, mapping translational enhancer function uniquely to the HDE. To confirm that the increase in luciferase expression occurred at the level of translation, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed on RNA recovered from injected embryos to assess the stability of each firefly reporter RNA relative to the control, Renilla RNA. The ratio of firefly luciferase/Renilla RNA from four independent injection experiments was 0.34 ± 0.11, whereas the ratio for luc-HDE-(1–97)/Renilla RNA for three independent experiments was 0.27 ± 0.15. These values are not significantly different as judged by Student's t test (p = 0.5), and thus the HDE does not have a significant effect on the stability of the reporter RNA. We conclude that the increased luciferase expression observed for the luc-HDE-(1–97) RNA occurs at the level of translation. Since our microinjection assay recapitulates only the translational enhancer function of the HDE, we were ideally positioned to specifically study translational enhancement. The HDE Can Be Subdivided into Multiple Translational Regulatory Elements—To map regions within the HDE required for translational enhancement, the effects of various deletions on the ability of the HDE to stimulate translation were assessed using the microinjection assay (Fig. 1). Deletion of the first 25 nucleotides of the HDE gave a 35-fold enhancement of luciferase activity, more than twice that generated by the intact HDE. This suggests the presence of a repressor element in the first 25 nucleotides of the HDE. Deletion of the last 25 nucleotides of the HDE, on the other hand, reduced translational enhancement by 80% (from 14- to 2.8-fold), suggesting the presence of positively acting sequences within this region. Simultaneous deletion of the first 25 nucleotides and the last 25 nucleotides gave 4.3-fold enhancement, whereas fusion of the first 25 nucleotides directly to the last 25 nucleotides gave a 6.4-fold enhancement. Given the presence of a repressive element within the first 25 nucleotides, it was possible that the last 25 nucleotides on their own might stimulate translation above levels seen for the fusion of the first 25 to the last 25 nucleotides. This is not, however, the case, since the last 25 nucleotides alone enhanced expression over the empty reporter by only 4.0-fold. In summary, the HDE contains multiple subelements that are able to modulate translation, including one that can dampen HDE-mediated enhancement and several that contribute positively. The net effect of the HDE thus represents the combined action of all of these elements. The HDE Is Bound by a Single Protein Complex—The existence of multiple subelements within the HDE suggests that several trans-acting factors interact with the HDE and that the combined action of all of these factors, both stimulatory and inhibitory in function, is responsible for the magnitude of translational stimulation. To identify these trans-acting factors, we performed an electromobility shift assay to detect embryonic proteins that are capable of interacting with the intact HDE. We observed a single shifted band, suggesting that a single protein or a single complex of proteins interacts with the HDE (Fig. 2A). This complex binds specifically, since excess unlabeled HDE RNA competed efficiently for binding, whereas an unlabeled, irrelevant RNA did not. Interestingly, the inclusion of different amounts of specific competitor revealed distinct shifted complexes. This suggests that the complex formed in the absence of competitor represents multiple proteins with different affinities for the HDE and hence different competition profiles. Additional evidence, presented below, indicates that the HDE is indeed bound by a multiprotein complex. We next employed a UV cross-linking assay to detect proteins that directly contact the HDE (Fig. 2B). Several of the labeled proteins, including species at 170, 110, and 70 kDa and three bands at ∼55 kDa, bound specifically, since unlabeled HDE RNA competed away their binding more efficiently than did an irrelevant RNA. These HDE-binding proteins are candidate mediators of translational enhancement in early embryos. DDP1 Interacts with the HDE—Biochemical purification of the 170-kDa HDE-binding protein allowed its identification via mass spectrometry as the Drosophila dodeca-satellite protein 1 (supplemental Fig. 1). DDP1 contains 15 “K-homology” domains (18Cortes A. Huertas D. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Marsellach F.X. Pina B. Azorin F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3820-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and belongs to a highly conserved family of proteins collectively called “vigilins,” several of which are known to function as post-transcriptional regulators (19Cunningham K.S. Dodson R.E. Nagel M.A. Shapiro D.J. Schoenberg D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12498-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Lang B.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1576-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Li A.M. Watson A. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1830-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To confirm the identification of DDP1 as the 170-kDa HDE-binding protein, we performed a UV cross-linking reaction using crude embryo extract and radiolabeled HDE RNA, followed by immunoprecipitation with either an anti-DDP1 antibody or nonimmune serum (Fig. 2C). The UV cross-linked protein that migrates at 170 kDa is specifically immunoprecipitated by the anti-DDP1 antibody but not by nonimmune serum. These results demonstrate that DDP1 is an HDE-binding protein and that DDP1 contacts the RNA directly. Hrp48 Interacts with the HDE—To facilitate the identification of additional HDE-binding proteins, we attempted to more precisely map their binding sites within the HDE, reasoning that smaller RNAs would be more useful in the TRAP-tagging method described below. To carry out this mapping, we used 25-nucleotide-long overlapping fragments of the HDE as probes in UV cross-linking reactions. Only the triplet at 55 kDa was able to bind efficiently to these small RNA probes (supplemental Fig. 2). Although the upper band bound to each probe, the lower two bands only bound to sequences within the 5′ and 3′ 25 nucleotides of the HDE. To identify the 55-kDa HDE-binding proteins, we developed an affinity-based purification method that we refer to as “TRAP tagging.” The TRAP protocol involves generation via in vitro transcription of an RNA that carries the sequence of interest along with two RNA affinity tags. The RNA is incubated with extract, and the RNA along with bound proteins is purified via the tags. The first tag used in this purification is an S1 aptamer that binds streptavidin resin and may be specifically eluted by soluble biotin (14Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. RNA. 2001; 7: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. Methods. 2002; 26: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This gentle elution preserves binding of protein to the RNA, allowing for a second round of purification via the second affinity tag, which is composed of two tandemly arrayed hairpins that bind to the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (16Hirao I. Spingola M. Peabody D. Ellington A.D. Mol. Divers. 1998; 4: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The RNA-protein complexes eluted from streptavidin resin are captured on glutathione S-transferase-MS2 coat protein fusion immobilized on glutathione resin. Bound proteins are then eluted by treatment with RNases. Our bait RNA for TRAP tagging carried three copies of HDE nucleotides 73–97. Three copies of HDE nucleotides 49–72 were used as the negative control, since this region showed little binding to the 55-kDa proteins (supplemental Fig. 2). Proteins purified via the TRAP tag method were separated via SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 3A). A band that specifically co-purified with nucleotides 73–97 of the HDE and migrated at ∼55 kDa was excised from the gel and identified as the Drosophila heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), Hrp48, using mass spectrometry. Hrp48 is a member of the hnRNP A/B family of proteins that has previously been shown to function in RNA splice site selection, RNA localization, and translational repression (9Hammond L.E. Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Siebel C.W. Kanaar R. Rio D.C.

Cell. 2004; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To confirm that Hrp48 is the 55-kDa HDE-binding activity, we performed a UV cross-linking reaction with radiolabeled HDE RNA followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Hrp48 antibody. The doublet at 55 kDa was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Hrp48 antibody but not by nonimmune serum (Fig. 3B), indicating that the 55-kDa HDE binding activity is indeed Hrp48. PABP Is an HDE-binding Protein—Our initial UV cross-linking experiments indicated that proteins additional to DDP1 and Hrp48 bind directly to the HDE (Fig. 2B). To identify additional HDE-binding proteins, we again used TRAP tagging. UV cross-linking reactions with fragments of the HDE indicated that most of the HDE-binding proteins require longer sequences to bind to the RNA. Therefore, we used TRAP-tagged full-length HDE as bait in this particular purification. We found that several proteins co-purify with TRAP-tagged full-length HDE but not with an irrelevant negative control RNA of similar length (Fig. 3C). One of these proteins was identified as PABP. An anti-PABP antibody, but not nonimmune serum, specifically immunoprecipitated the 72-kDa protein present in UV cross-linked material, confirming the identification (Fig. 3D). We note that PABP co-purified with the full-length HDE, that Hrp48 co-purified with the TRAP-tagged 3×(73–97) subelement but not TRAP-tagged full-length HDE, and that DDP1 co-purified with neither bait but was, in fact, purified by more conventional methods. One possible interpretation of these data is that the interaction of DDP1 and Hrp48 proteins is not sufficiently stable for them to co-purify with the full-length HDE during TRAP purification. If so, our results highlight the utility of using both multimerized subelements and the full-length element as bait. DDP1, Hrp48, and PABP Are Components of the HDE-binding Complex—Having shown that DDP1, Hrp48, and PABP each bind directly to the HDE and that there is a single HDE-binding complex (Fig. 2A), we next investigated whether all three proteins are present in the complex and therefore could function together in translational enhancement. To do this, we performed a gel mobility shift assay with radiolabeled HDE probe, excised the shifted complex, and exposed the gel slice to UV radiation to cross-link HDE-binding proteins to the probe. Proteins were eluted from the gel in the presence of RNase A, the eluate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody or nonimmune serum, and radiolabeled immunoprecipitated protein was detected via phosphorimaging following SDS-PAGE. Labeled DDP1, Hrp48, and PABP were each detected in the eluate from the complex, whereas another RNA-binding protein, Smaug, which does not interact with the HDE (data not shown), was not (Fig. 4). These results suggest that that DDP1, Hrp48, and PABP interact directly and simultaneously with the HDE to form a single RNP complex. DDP1 Functions in HDE-mediated Translational Enhancement—Although a role for PABP in translational stimulation is well documented, the same cannot be said for DDP1 or Hrp48. We therefore decided to focus our efforts on establishing roles for DDP1 and Hrp48 in HDE function. We were unable to obtain mutations in the HDE that specifically blocked binding of only one of these proteins and so could not use mutation of their binding sites within the HDE to assess their individual roles. For DDP1, a genetic approach was not feasible, since we found that females expressing significantly reduced levels of DDP1 lay fragile eggs that are not suitable for injection. As an alternative approach to assessing the role of DDP1 in translational enhancement, we asked what effect recruitment of DDP1 to a reporter mRNA would have on its translation. The Xenopus DDP1 homolog, Vigilin, has been shown to bind to RNAs greater than 55 nucleotides long carrying repeats of the sequence AnCU (26Kanamori H. Dodson R.E. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3991-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a single match to this consensus was found within the HDE. A 62-nucleotide-long RNA carrying three tandem copies of this sequence, AAAAAACU, was used as a probe in a UV cross-linking reaction followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-DDP1 antibody or nonimmune serum. The anti-DDP1 antibody specifically immunoprecipitated the 170-kDa DDP1 band, whereas nonimmune serum did not (supplemental Fig. 3A). An unlabeled version of the RNA carrying these three repeats was able to compete for binding to DDP1 in a UV cross-linking assay. In contrast, mutation of the C residue to a G within each repeat prevented an unlabeled RNA from competing for DDP1 binding (supplemental Fig. 3B) but had no effect on binding of other proteins, arguing that any difference in the function of the wild-type and mutant sequences reflects a specific difference in DDP1 binding. Firefly luciferase reporter RNAs were then generated carrying either the wild-type or mutant DDP1-binding sequence inserted into the firefly luciferase 3′-UTR and injected into embryos. The wild-type element enhanced translation 3.5-fold relative to firefly luciferase RNA carrying no insert, and the mutant element reduced translational enhancement by more than 50% (Fig. 5). These results suggest that DDP1 by itself directs modest translational enhancement and that additional HDE sequences and their cognate binding proteins (such as Hrp48 and PABP) are required for high level enhancement. It is also possible that additional, unknown proteins interact with and contribute to the ability of the synthetic DDP1-binding sequence to stimulate translation. Hrp48 Functions in HDE-mediated Translational Enhancement—Next we analyzed the role of Hrp48 in HDE-mediated translational enhancement using our microinjection assay in embryos that express reduced amounts of functional Hrp48. hrp48 mutations cause lethality at the larval stage (9Hammond L.E. Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), so we used Flp/FRT-mediated mitotic recombination (10Chou T.-B. Perrimon N. Genetics. 1992; 131: 643-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate clones of germ line cells with reduced levels of Hrp48. When such clones are homozygous for strong hrp48 mutations, no eggs are produced, necessitating the use of weaker alleles to produce embryos for microinjection. Microinjection experiments showed that the intact HDE stimulated translation in these mutant embryos to the same extent as in wild type (data not shown). We reasoned that this might have resulted from the fact that the activity of the HDE reflects the combined action of several proteins that interact with the HDE and that a partial loss of only Hrp48 would thus not have a significant effect. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that subregions within the HDE were each able to mediate some level of translational enhancement (Fig. 1). We reasoned that a mutant version of the HDE that is impaired in its ability to stimulate translation might be more sensitive to loss of Hrp48. We therefore tested the ability of the HDE construct (1–24)+(73–97) in the injection assay, since it contains both of the Hrp48-binding sites and is impaired for translational enhancement. Two mutant hrp48 alleles mediated translational enhancement via (1–24)+(73–97) at a level that was decreased by ∼30% relative to that seen in wild-type embryos (Fig. 5). That translation-enhancing activity was not completely eliminated in these mutant embryos was probably due to the residual functional Hrp48 protein. Affinity Purification of RNA-binding Proteins—The TRAP procedure described here is a novel method for identification of proteins that interact with a given RNA sequence. The TRAP procedure is adaptable to a wide variety of bait sequences; here we have employed tagged RNAs generated in vitro to purify proteins from a crude extract. In principle, tagged RNAs could also be expressed in vivo, allowing for the purification of native endogenous RNA complexes. This will be particularly important when the recruitment of a complex to an RNA is influenced by earlier regulatory events. Although techniques for analysis of genomes and proteomes are well established, methods to study the ribonome (i.e. the sum total of all RNAs and their interacting proteins within the cell) lag behind. The TRAP tagging system provides a new method to employ in such efforts. Translational Enhancement in Drosophila—Although our previous work provided genetic evidence that the HDE is a multifunctional cis-acting element capable of stimulating both translation and transcript degradation, here we have conducted biochemical experiments that demonstrate that the HDE is a bona fide translational enhancer. These experiments identified DDP1, Hrp48, and PABP as HDE-binding proteins, and our injection assay provided evidence that both DDP1 and Hrp48 contribute to the ability of HDE to stimulate translation. Since, in the context of the injection assay, translational stimulation occurs in the absence of transcript degradation, these two post-transcriptional processes are likely to be mediated by separable mechanisms. This is consistent with our recent results, which show that the major RNA destabilization element resides in the Hsp83 open reading frame, whereas the HDE functions as an auxiliary degradation element. 5J.

Evolutionary Conservation of the Translational Enhancement Machinery—Our data, taken together with data of others, suggest that all three of the HDE-binding proteins identified here play conserved roles in translational enhancement. In mammals, PABP enhances translation of YB-1 mRNA in a poly(A) tail-independent manner by binding to an element located in the transcript's 3′-UTR (5Skabkina O.V. Skabkin M.A. Popova N.V. Lyabin D.N. Penalva L.O. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18191-18198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Likewise, our data showing that PABP interacts with the HDE suggests that recruitment of PABP to elements internal to a transcript's 3′-UTR may be a conserved mechanism for translational enhancement. We note, however, that we do not yet know whether translational enhancement via the HDE is poly(A) tail-independent. DDP1 is a member of the vigilin family of proteins. These proteins have been shown to function in diverse processes, including centromeric silencing, chromosome segregation, and control of mRNA stability and translation. The yeast homolog of DDP1, Scp160p, binds RNA, is present on polysomes, and associates with specific mRNAs in vivo (20Lang B.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1576-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Li A.M. Watson A. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1830-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One of these mRNAs, DHH1, shows decreased polysome association in an scp160 deletion strain, providing indirect evidence that Scp160p may enhance DHH1 translation. Here we have shown that DDP1 participates in translational enhancement by binding to the HDE, suggesting a conserved function for this family of proteins in translational control. Hrp48 is a member of the hnRNP A/B family (27Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). A mammalian homolog, hnRNP A2, stimulates translation of myelin basic protein mRNA in oligodendrocytes through an hnRNP A2 response element (A2RE) in the transcript's 3′-UTR (28Kwon S. Barbarese E. Carson J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the A2RE can also mediate translational repression when hnRNP A2 recruits hnRNP E1 to the transcript (29Kosturko L.D. Maggipinto M.J. Korza G. Lee J.W. Carson J.H. Barbarese E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3521-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, hnRNP A2 can mediate both translational repression and enhancement via the A2RE. Drosophila Hrp48 was first identified based on its role in splice site selection (9Hammond L.E. Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Siebel C.W. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1713-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown play a role in the translational repression and localization of mRNAs in Drosophila oocytes (23Goodrich J.S. Clouse K.N. Schupbach T. Development. 2004; 131: 1949-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Huynh J.R. Munro T.P. Smith-Litiere K. Lepesant J.A. St Johnston D. Dev.

Cell. 2004; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that Hrp48 binds the HDE and mediates translational enhancement. The ability of Hrp48 to function in both translational repression and stimulation suggests that its function is influenced by other trans-acting factors that are known to be bound to that element (e.g. DDP1 and PABP) as well as other, unknown proteins present in the HDE-binding complex. A Combinatorial Model for Translation Enhancement—In addition to playing a conserved role in translational enhancement, our results show that DDP1, Hrp48, and PABP function together in this process. Stable formation of the DDP1-Hrp48-PABP complex on the HDE may involve cooperative interactions between individual proteins, either before or after they are bound to the mRNA. Consistent with this model, we were unable to identify mutations that block the binding of one of these proteins to the HDE without inhibiting binding of the others. Whether these proteins can form a stable complex in the absence of the HDE and subsequently bind RNA or whether they assemble on the HDE in a stepwise manner, will await further investigation. Different proteins within the complex could, for example, serve different functions, such as transcript recognition, complex stabilization, and interaction with the basal translational apparatus. With respect to the structure and function of cis-elements that mediate translational enhancement, our results support a model whereby the HDE is composed of binding sites for several proteins, each of which functions in translational control. Thus, the ability of the HDE to stimulate translation reflects integration of the individual action of each of its bound proteins. Consistent with this model, we find that no individual deletion within the HDE completely disables its ability to stimulate translation. Instead, these deletions enhance or diminish the extent of translational stimulation. Modulation of the output of the HDE could be achieved in different cell types and at different developmental stages by changing the complement of HDE-binding proteins that are present. By extension, the expression of mRNAs other than Hsp83 is likely to be fine tuned via cis-acting elements similar to the HDE, which are composed of different combinations of binding sites for proteins that mediate translational enhancement and repression.

The dependence of this major Cl− uptake pathway on Na+/H+ exchanger expression was examined in the parotid acinar cells of Nhe1−/- and Nhe2−/- mice, both of which exhibited impaired fluid secretion. No change in Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger activity was detected in Nhe2-deficient mice. Conversely, Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger activity increased nearly 4-fold in Nhe1-deficient mice, despite only minimal or any change in mRNA and protein levels of the anion exchanger Ae2. Acetazolamide completely blocked the increase in Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger activity in Nhe1-null mice suggesting that increased anion exchange required carbonic anhydrase activity. Indeed, the parotid glands of Nhe1−/- mice expressed higher levels of carbonic anhydrase 2 (Car2) polypeptide. Moreover, the enhanced Cl−/HCO−3 exchange activity was accompanied by an increased abundance of Car2·Ae2 complexes in the parotid plasma membranes of Nhe1−/- mice. Anion exchanger activity was also significantly reduced in Car2-deficient mice, consistent with an important role of a putative Car2·Ae2 HCO−3 transport metabolon in parotid exocrine cell function. Increased abundance of this HCO−3 transport metabolon is likely one of the multiple compensatory changes in the exocrine parotid gland of Nhe1−/- mice that together attenuate the severity of in vivo electrolyte and acid-base balance perturbations.

Increased abundance of this HCO−3 transport metabolon is likely one of the multiple compensatory changes in the exocrine parotid gland of Nhe1−/- mice that together attenuate the severity of in vivo electrolyte and acid-base balance perturbations. Fluid secretion by exocrine glands is a complex process that requires the coordinated activity of multiple ion transport and regulatory proteins to drive transepithelial Cl− movement and apical HCO−3 efflux (1Nauntofte B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G823-G837PubMed Google Scholar, 2Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Dissing S. Nauntofte B. Am. J.

Cl− uptake across the basolateral membrane of exocrine cells is generally mediated by two distinct mechanisms, the functionally linked Cl−/HCO−3 and Na+/H+ exchangers (which support NaCl uptake in exchange for intracellular HCO−3 and protons) and a Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter. In concert, these two Cl− uptake pathways concentrate Cl− 4–5-fold above its electrochemical equilibrium, whereas intracellular HCO−3 is generated by carbonic anhydrase. Stimulation generates a transepithelial potential difference due to apical Cl− and HCO−3 efflux via anion channels and basolateral K+ loss through potassium channels. Na+ crosses the tight junction in response to the resulting lumen-negative, transepithelial potential difference, and water follows the consequent osmotic gradient to produce a NaCl-rich, plasma-like secretion. The Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger isoform Ae2 (also known as Slc4a2) and the Na+/H+ exchanger Nhe1 (Slc9a1) co-localize to the basolateral membrane in salivary exocrine cells (5Nguyen H.V. Stuart-Tilley A.

These animals exhibit defective Cl− uptake and, in consequence, a dramatic 60–70% reduction of fluid output by parotid glands in vivo. The residual fluid production in Nkcc1−/- mice is mediated by the paired Cl−/HCO−3 and Na+/H+ exchangers (12Evans R.L. Park K. Turner R.J. Watson G.E. Nguyen H.V. Dennett M.R. Hand A.R. Flagella M.

Vilas G.L. Casey J.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2499-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that bound CaII elevates rates of HCO−3 production and consumption within a microdomain near the intracellular anion binding and translocation site(s) of Cl−/HCO−3 exchangers. Conversely, peptides with sequences that include the proposed CaII binding site of the anion exchanger Ae1 strongly activate CaII (28Scozzafava A. Supuran C.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, close proximity of CaII with anion exchanger polypeptides may be required for maximal bicarbonate transport activity. To gain further insight into the functional relationship between the Cl−/HCO−3 and Na+/H+ exchangers of the basolateral membrane of exocrine acinar cells, we examined the expression and activity of HCO−3 metabolism and transport proteins in parotid acini of mice deficient in Nhe1 and Nhe2. Our results demonstrate that Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger activity was significantly enhanced in the parotid exocrine cells of Nhe1-deficient mice, but not in mice lacking Nhe2. Moreover, the interaction of murine carbonic anhydrase II (Car2) with Ae2 was enhanced in Nhe1-deficient mice, suggesting an in vivo correlation between increases in Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger activity and formation of a functional Car2-Ae2 bicarbonate transport metabolon.

Briefly, CO2-narcotized mice were killed by exsanguination prior to isolation of acinar cells by collagenase digestion. Acinar cells were BCECF-loaded by 20–30-min incubation at room temperature with BCECF-AM (2 μm). Acinar cells spontaneously adhered to the base of a superfusion chamber mounted on a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope interfaced with an Axon Imaging Workbench (Foster City, CA) or TILL Photonics Imaging System (Pleasanton, CA).

Oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of water containing 10 ng of Ae2a cRNA or no RNA and incubated for 3 days at 19 °C in ND-96, pH 7.4 containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 Hepes, supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and with gentamicin (100 μg/100 ml). Oocytes were then injected with 50 nl of 36Cl− (∼12,000 cpm), allowed to reseal for 10 min in Cl−-free ND-96, and 36Cl− efflux was measured as described previously (11Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N.

Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Briefly, parotid exocrine cells were isolated as described above from Nhe1+/+ or Nhe1− /- mice. Mice used to detect anion exchanger Ae2 protein by Western analysis were injected subcutaneously with heparin (13.6 units/gm body weight) and perfused via the left ventricle with PBS prior to gland excision to remove erythrocytes and thus eliminate or minimize the presence of immunocross-reactive erythroid anion exchanger Ae1 (34Kopito R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Dispersed parotid cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0). After the addition of 10 mm Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin stock solution (80 μl per ml of PBS), cells were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C or (not shown; n = 4) on ice. The reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) for 10 min, and then the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Preparation of Crude and Affinity-enriched Plasma Membrane Proteins—Enriched plasma membranes were isolated essentially as described previously (35Zhao Y. Zhang W. Kho Y. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 36Zhao Y. Zhang W. White M.A. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 3751-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Biotinylated cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 45 s and the pellet resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were homogenized with a glass-teflon tissue grinder (20 passes; Wheaton Science Products, Millville, NJ). Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved and the pellet resuspended and centrifuged in the same volume of homogenization buffer as before. The collected supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in the same buffer and centrifuged at 46,000 × g (Beckman SS28 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant crude pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (containing 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) and then incubated with 200 μl of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin at 4 °C overnight. Beads were collected with a magnetic plate and washed with hypotonic buffer to obtain the membrane associated fractions. The streptavidin beads carrying the enriched plasma membrane fractions were suspended in 100 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Biotech ASA) and then centrifuged at 10,600 × g for 3 min. The supernatants were collected and used for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Protein (30 μg) was heated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to separation in a 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE Tris-Glycine mini-gel (Bio-Rad). Protein was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C using a transfer buffer containing 10 mm CAPS, pH 11 in 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and then incubated with primary antibody for Ae2 amino acid 1224–1237 (5Nguyen H.V.

After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Pierce) at a dilution of 1:2,500 in tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20/2.5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature for the anti-Ae2 antibody or with 1:20,000 donkey anti-sheep/goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Biodesign International) for anti-CaII and -CaIV antibodies. Labeled proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection kit; Amersham Biosciences). In control experiments, the CaIV and Ae2 antibodies were pre-absorbed (incubation at 4 °C overnight) with 2 or 24 μg/ml immunizing peptide, respectively (not shown). Values quoted are the mean ± S.E. for the number of gland preparations examined. Co-immunoprecipitation of Ae2 and Car2 Proteins—Extracts of affinity-enriched membrane protein fractions (100 μg) from Nhe1+/+ or Nhe1− /- mice were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of goat polyclonal anti-CaII antibody. ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein G-agarose beads (100 μl; Pierce) previously equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4) were added to the immunoprecipitates and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the beads and attached immune complexes were washed five times with ice-cold PBS pH 7.4. Beads carrying the immunoprecipitated complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE separation on a 7.5% Tris-Glycine gel. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked as described above. The blocked membrane was incubated with Ae2 primary antibody (1:2,000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase, for 1 h at room temperature. The labeled proteins were identified by the ECL detection method. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from parotid glands using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by poly(A) selection on an oligo(dT) cellulose column (Invitrogen). Each sample contained glands pooled from three mice. Northern blots were prepared and hybridized as described previously (37Evans R.L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol.

A cDNA for mouse ribosomal messenger RNA L32 (mouse nucleotide 3078–3244, GenBank™ accession number K02060) was used to normalize expression between preparations (not shown). Quantitative analysis of the northern blots was performed using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager (Hercules, CA). Cl−/HCO−3 Exchanger Activity Is Enhanced in Nhe1-deficient Mice—Knocking out the expression of an ion transport pathway is frequently associated with up-regulation of other functionally related transport proteins (29Schultheis P.J.

Thus, Na+/H+ exchanger null mutation might be expected to give rise to compensatory changes to enhance the movement of Cl− and HCO−3 by increasing Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger activity. The Na+/H+ exchanger Nhe1 regulates fluid secretion by maintaining an intracellular alkaline pH, which in turn facilitates Cl− uptake via the action of the basolateral Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger in salivary gland acinar cells (4Melvin J.E.

To examine the effects of Nhe1 gene disruption on Cl−/HCO−3 exchanger activity we monitored the intracellular pH of parotid exocrine cells loaded with the pH-sensitive dye BCECF. An intracellular alkalinization occurs following the removal of bath Cl−, as extracellular HCO−3 exchanges for intracellular Cl− in cells expressing anion exchange. Such an alkalinization was observed in exocrine acinar cells from both wild type (Fig. 1A, left panel) and Nhe1-deficient (right panel) mice. Cl−/HCO−3 exchange was inhibited greater than 85% by the anion exchange inhibitor DIDS (Fig. 1A, filled circles) in both wild type and Nhe1-deficient cells. Fig. 1B summarizes results from experiments like those shown in A as the DIDS-sensitive component of the rate of alkalinization (wild type = 0.08 ± 0.01 pH units/min, n = 19; Nhe1− /- = 0.30 ± 0.06 pH units/min, n = 17; p < 0.001). The rate of DIDS-sensitive anion exchanger activity in Nhe1− /- mice was nearly 4-fold faster than the activity in parotid cells from wild type animals. Nhe2 is expressed in the apical membranes of mouse parotid acinar cells (6Park K. Evans R.L. Watson G.E. Nehrke K. Richardson L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Hand A.R. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2061522909,"Bacterial conjugation, transfer of a single strand of a conjugative plasmid between bacteria, requires sequence-specific single-stranded DNA endonucleases called relaxases or nickases. Relaxases contain an HUH (His-hydrophobe-His) motif, part of a three-His cluster that binds a divalent cation required for the cleavage reaction. Crystal structures of the F plasmid TraI relaxase domain, with and without bound single-stranded DNA, revealed an extensive network of interactions involving HUH and other residues. Here we study the roles of these residues in TraI function. Whereas substitutions for the three His residues alter metal-binding properties of the protein, the same substitution at each position elicits different effects, indicating that the residues contribute asymmetrically to metal binding. Substitutions for a conserved Asp that interacts with one HUH His demonstrate that the Asp modulates metal affinity despite its distance from the metal. The bound metal enhances binding of ssDNA to the protein, consistent with a role for the metal in positioning the scissile phosphate for cleavage. Most substitutions tested caused significantly reduced in vitro cleavage activities and in vivo transfer efficiencies. In summary, the results suggest that the metal-binding His cluster in TraI is a finely tuned structure that achieves a sufficient affinity for metal while avoiding the unfavorable electrostatics that would result from placing an acidic residue near the scissile phosphate of the bound ssDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2051559242,"DNA replication, recombination, and repair can result in formation of diverse branched DNA structures. Many large DNA viruses are known to encode DNA branch nucleases, but several of the expected activities have not previously been found among poxvirus enzymes. Vaccinia encodes an enzyme, A22 resolvase, which is known to be active on four-stranded DNA junctions (Holliday junctions) or Holliday junction-like structures containing three of the four strands. Here we report that A22 resolvase in fact has a much wider substrate specificity than previously appreciated. A22 resolvase cleaves Y-junctions, single-stranded DNA flaps, transitions from double strands to unpaired single strands (""splayed duplexes""), and DNA bulges in vitro. We also report site-directed mutagenesis studies of candidate active site residues. The results identify the likely active site and support a model in which a single active site is responsible for cleavage on Holliday junctions and splayed duplexes. Lastly, we describe possible roles for the A22 resolvase DNA-branch nuclease activity in DNA replication and repair."

Synaptic plasticity, widely considered the cellular basis for learning and memory, is mediated in the hippocampus largely by changes in the number of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) on individual “spines” protruding from the dendritic plasma membrane (Malenka and Bear, 2004Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Each spine mediates a distinct synaptic input, and under physiological conditions, plasticity occurs selectively at some synapses but not others. How do neurons modify the number of AMPARs selectively on individual spines? In a recent issue of Neuron, Lu et al., 2007Lu J. Helton T.D. Blandpied T.A. Rácz B. Newpher T.M. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2007; 55 (September 20 issue)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2007.06.041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar provide an important clue based on their studies of AMPAR endocytosis. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis of AMPARs is stimulated by synaptic activity and occurs primarily in regions of the plasma membrane termed postsynaptic endocytic zones (EZs). EZs are localized in the spine adjacent to a dense network of scaffold proteins called the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Figure 1). Lu et al. hypothesized that Homer—a protein that is highly expressed in neurons and binds to both the PSD-embedded protein Shank and the endocytic protein dynamin-3 (Gray et al., 2003Gray N.W. Fourgeaud L. Huang B. Chen J. Cao H. Oswald B.J. Hemar A. McNiven M.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Tu et al., 1999Tu J.C. Xiao B.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar)—could be the lynchpin in a series of interactions that physically links the EZ to the PSD. To test this hypothesis, they inhibited the interaction of Homer with either Shank or dynamin-3 in cultured neurons by overexpressing mutant versions of dynamin-3 or Shank that could not bind to Homer and then used fluorescence microscopy to examine effects on the localization of EZs. Consistent with their hypothesis, EZs became mislocalized away from synapses when interactions between dynamin-3 and Homer, or Homer and Shank, were disrupted. Furthermore, depleting endogenous dynamin-3 from hippocampal neurons using RNA interference also caused the mislocalization of EZs. In these neurons, expression of wild-type dynamin-3—but not dynamin-3 mutants lacking domains required for oligomerization or binding to Homer—rescued appropriate localization of EZs adjacent to the PSD. These results indicate that a multimeric protein complex involving Homer keeps the EZ closely situated at the periphery of dendritic spines. But what is the functional significance of this exquisite spatial organization? Lu et al. observed that mislocalization of EZs selectively inhibited AMPAR endocytosis but not clathrin-dependent endocytosis of transferrin, a distinct cargo that is endocytosed primarily from extrasynaptic regions. More surprisingly, despite markedly delayed endocytosis of AMPARs in neurons where EZ localization was disrupted, the steady-state number of AMPARs present on spines actually decreased. This result, established initially by antibody staining, was confirmed functionally by measuring miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Moreover, repopulation of the spine membrane by endocytosed AMPARs was delayed in spines lacking a nearby EZ, suggesting that localized endocytosis is required for efficient recycling of AMPARs to the spine. How could clathrin-coated pits localized to EZs selectively promote recycling of AMPARs to spines? One possibility is that coated pits formed at the EZ are functionally different from those formed elsewhere on the neuron and selectively direct endocytosed receptors to a recycling pathway. This pathway is perhaps analogous to a subset of coated pits that have been described in non-neural cells, which contain distinct membrane cargo that can be delivered to endosomes that differ in their ability to recycle (Lakadamyali et al., 2006Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Zhuang X. Cell. 2006; 124: 997-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, Puthenveedu and von Zastrow, 2006Puthenveedu M.A. von Zastrow M. Cell. 2006; 127: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that endocytosis of AMPARs from EZs generates endocytic vesicles that preferentially fuse with spine-localized recycling endosomes, perhaps simply as a consequence of local proximity, whereas endocytic vesicles generated elsewhere in the dendrite tend to fuse with endosomes that promote recycling less efficiently. The authors favor the latter hypothesis, proposing that the spatial localization of EZs adjacent to the PSD establishes an isolated endocytic pathway mediating AMPAR cycling that is restricted to a single spine. This is an attractive idea, particularly in view of the synapse-specific nature of plasticity observed physiologically, but it remains to be tested directly. Although components of both the recycling and biosynthetic pathways have been localized close to and within spines, potentially consistent with the occurrence of spine-restricted trafficking, there is also evidence that shared trafficking machinery may serve multiple spines (Cooney et al., 2002Cooney J.R. Hurlburt J.L. Selig D.K. Harris K.M. Fiala J.C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important next question, therefore, is whether AMPARs endocytosed from EZs are locally reinserted directly into the adjacent spine or PSD, or whether AMPAR trafficking to the spine involves longer-range lateral movement following more distant exocytic insertion. Endocytic events persist visibly as maturing coated pits for seconds to minutes before the endocytic vesicle pinches off, making the location of AMPAR endocytosis relatively straightforward to determine using conventional imaging methods. Exocytic events mediating receptor insertion into the plasma membrane are much more fleeting, typically occurring within milliseconds, presenting fundamental challenges of both spatial and temporal resolution that are only now becoming surmountable (Yudowski et al., 2006Yudowski G.A. Puthenveedu M.A. von Zastrow M. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The current discussion of local versus long-range endocytic trafficking of postsynaptic AMPARs is reminiscent of that regarding endocytic trafficking of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins at the presynaptic terminal (Heuser and Reese, 1973Heuser J.E. Reese T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 315-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Several components of the synaptic vesicle membrane, previously thought to cycle locally with little sharing or exchange between adjacent presynaptic terminals (Murthy and Stevens, 1998Murthy V.N. Stevens C.F. Nature. 1998; 392: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), now appear capable of rapid exchange (Fernandez-Alfonso et al., 2006Fernandez-Alfonso T. Kwan R. Ryan T.A. Neuron. 2006; 51: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Whether postsynaptic cycling of AMPARs is strictly confined to individual spines or is capable of mediating receptor “sharing” among neighboring or even distant spines remains a fascinating question with fundamental implications for understanding synaptic function and plasticity. The elegant studies of Lu et al. make an important step toward addressing this issue and provide compelling evidence that, when it comes to endocytosis of neurotransmitter receptors, location really matters. Postsynaptic Positioning of Endocytic Zones and AMPA Receptor Cycling by Physical Coupling of Dynamin-3 to HomerLu et al.NeuronSeptember 20, 2007In BriefEndocytosis of AMPA receptors and other postsynaptic cargo occurs at endocytic zones (EZs), stably positioned sites of clathrin adjacent to the postsynaptic density (PSD).

However, the mechanisms that situate the EZ near the PSD and the role of spine endocytosis in synaptic transmission are unknown.

The story of water on Mars has a checkered past. Historically thought to be criss-crossed by alien canals, the arrival of the first spacecraft showed that the red planet is bone dry. A flotilla of satellites has since traveled to Mars. Water ice has been seen dusting the ground, in hydrous minerals, in glaciers draped on volcano walls, and, the vast majority, locked up in the polar caps. Such a frosting gives a clue that water was once abundant on Mars and the planet's early climate was wet. Since then, water has been lost from the surface and atmosphere. It is possible that some may have survived underground, occasionally seeping to the surface, and so signs of flowing water have been sought extensively. Such places would be top destinations for future landers to search for signs of extant or past life.

The primary mission of the latest spacecraft to reach the red planet, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), is to study its hydrologic history. It is opening up new vistas with its exceptionally keen eyesight. Regional landforms were mapped before, but MRO can now spot boulders less than a few meters in size, allowing Martian global geology to be surveyed on a human scale over vast areas. Among several other instruments, it also contains a radar sounder for exploring subsurface ice deposits and is accurately measuring Mars' gravity. This special issue presents scientific results from MRO detailed images of the ice-capped poles and regions thought to have been shaped by liquid water, both recently and in the past.

The papers in this issue show that evidence for liquid water is rare and difficult to discern (see also the News story by Kerr, p. [1673][2]). Images of supposed ancient ocean floors and riverbeds show no obvious signs that liquid water was ever present. Reexamination of some landforms implies that they have been formed by flowing lava, not water. The only locations where features seem to indicate the presence of liquid water today or in the recent past are on the rims of craters and some gullies, suggesting that heat from impacts may have been the trigger for trickles rather than a revealed water table. Radar and gravity data show that the cap on Mars' south pole now holds the largest reservoir of relatively pure water ice on the planet, and layers there and in the north polar cap reveal seasonal oscillations in climate.

These papers thus provide a tour around the martian world of water in the first 100 days or so of the main MRO mission. More will be revealed as it continues to probe the surface, including Mars' mineralogy, and focuses several instruments on its atmosphere, dust, and clouds. But there is a lot to drink already.
