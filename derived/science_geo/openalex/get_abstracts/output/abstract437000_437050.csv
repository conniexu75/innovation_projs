https://openalex.org/W1994682066,"Mobile Phone “Hot Spots” An obstacle to developing effective national malaria control programs is a lack of understanding of human movements, which are an important component of disease transmission. As mobile phones have become increasingly ubiquitous, it is now possible to collect individual-level, longitudinal data on human movements on a massive scale. Wesolowski et al. (p. 267 ) analyzed mobile phone call data records representing the travel patterns of 15 million mobile phone owners in Kenya over the course of a year. This was combined with a detailed malaria risk map, to estimate malaria parasite movements across the country that could be caused by human movement. This information enabled detailed analysis of parasite sources and sinks between hundreds of local settlements. Estimates were compared with hospital data from Nairobi to show that local pockets of transmission likely occur around the periphery of Nairobi, accounting for locally acquired cases, contrary to the accepted idea that there is no transmission in the capital."
https://openalex.org/W2038222533,"The Right Choice? So-called irrational decisions made by humans are popular fodder for “believe it or not” stories. But what's actually happening when we make choices that do not seem to be justifiable on purely economic or logical grounds? Presumably, we are not simply making errors; instead, our choices may reflect an internal bias that we are not aware of. Wimmer and Shohamy (p. 270 ) show how the hippocampus can instill an unconscious bias in valuations, whereby an object that is not highly valued on its own, increases in value when it becomes implicitly associated with a truly high-value object. As a consequence, we then end up preferring the associated object over a neutral object of equal objective value while not really knowing why."
https://openalex.org/W1979888857,"Cheat Control In quorum-sensing induction, a Pseudomonas aeruginosa population growing on a single carbon source, such as casein, will reach a density where the levels of signaling molecules they collectively secrete triggers the cells to synthesize and secrete proteases to digest the casein. However, it is metabolically costly to secrete proteases, and the system is prone to mutant “cheats.” These cheats do not respond to quorum sensing and do not go to the cost of synthesizing protease, but they do profit from the breakdown products that allow all the cells—cheats and cooperators alike—to grow. Dandekar et al. (p. 264 ) found that quorum signaling–insensitive P. aeruginosa cheats could not synthesize nucleotide hydrolase and were thus unable to grow if casein was replaced by adenosine. This allowed cooperators to outgrow the cheats, leading to a stable equilibrium between cheats and cooperators. This principle of regulation may be applicable to other bacterial quorum-sensing systems and might be exploited in the development of drugs that disrupt bacterial cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2082272068,"Feeling the Light There has been a link missing in our understanding of the biochemical signaling mechanism initiated when photons are absorbed by rhodopsin in the photoreceptor cells of Drosophila eyes. Photoisomerization of rhodopsin activates a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide—binding protein which leads to activation of phospholipase C. But how phospholipase C activates the transient receptor potential (TRP) or the transient receptor potential–like (TRPL) ion channels that produce the rest of the cellular response has been unclear. Hardie and Franze (p. 260 ; see the Perspective by Liman ) propose that there is a physical mechanism at work. Atomic force microscopy revealed light-induced contractions of photoreceptor cells. Consistent with a physical coupling mechanism, manipulations of the membrane altered responses of the photoreceptor cells to light. Thus, physical changes in the membrane appear to couple phospholipase C activity to the opening of mechanosensitive TRP and TRPL channels."
https://openalex.org/W2033023549,"Although prostate cancer (CaP) is the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor in American men, the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of CaP remain largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that downregulation of the microRNA miR-124 occurs in several types of human cancer, suggesting a tumor suppressive function of miR-124. Until now, however, it has been unclear whether miR-124 is associated with CaP. In the present study, we completed a series of experiments to understand the functional role of miR-124 in CaP. We detected the expression level of miR-124 in clinical CaP tissues, evaluated the influence of miR-124 on the growth of CaP cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of miR-124. We found that (i) miR-124 directly targets the androgen receptor (AR) and subsequently induces an upregulation of p53; (ii) miR-124 is significantly downregulated in malignant prostatic cells compared to benign cells, and DNA methylation causes the reduced expression of miR-124; and (iii) miR-124 can inhibit the growth of CaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Data from this study revealed that loss of miR-124 expression is a common event in CaP, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of CaP. Our studies also suggest that miR-124 is a potential tumor suppressive gene in CaP, and restoration of miR-124 expression may represent a novel strategy for CaP therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2104678230,"Large trees with cavities provide critical ecological functions in forests worldwide, including vital nesting and denning resources for many species. However, many ecosystems are experiencing increasingly rapid loss of large trees or a failure to recruit new large trees or both. We quantify this problem in a globally iconic ecosystem in southeastern Australia--forests dominated by the world's tallest angiosperms, Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans). Tree, stand and landscape-level factors influencing the death and collapse of large living cavity trees and the decay and collapse of dead trees with cavities are documented using a suite of long-term datasets gathered between 1983 and 2011. The historical rate of tree mortality on unburned sites between 1997 and 2011 was >14% with a mortality spike in the driest period (2006-2009). Following a major wildfire in 2009, 79% of large living trees with cavities died and 57-100% of large dead trees were destroyed on burned sites. Repeated measurements between 1997 and 2011 revealed no recruitment of any new large trees with cavities on any of our unburned or burned sites. Transition probability matrices of large trees with cavities through increasingly decayed condition states projects a severe shortage of large trees with cavities by 2039 that will continue until at least 2067. This large cavity tree crisis in Mountain Ash forests is a product of: (1) the prolonged time required (>120 years) for initiation of cavities; and (2) repeated past wildfires and widespread logging operations. These latter factors have resulted in all landscapes being dominated by stands ≤72 years and just 1.16% of forest being unburned and unlogged. We discuss how the features that make Mountain Ash forests vulnerable to a decline in large tree abundance are shared with many forest types worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2098294048,"Deciphering the structural requirements and mechanisms for internalization of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) is required to improve their delivery efficiency. Herein, a unique role of tryptophan (Trp) residues in the interaction and structuring of cationic CPP sequences with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) has been characterized, in relation with cell internalization. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism, NMR, mass spectrometry, and phase-contrast microscopy, we compared the interaction of 7 basic CPPs with 5 classes of GAGs. We found that the affinity of CPPs for GAGs increases linearly with the number of Trp residues, from 30 nM for a penetratin analog with 1 Trp residue to 1.5 nM for a penetratin analog with 6 Trp residues for heparin (HI); peptides with Trp residues adopt a predominantly β-strand structure in complex with HI and form large, stable β-sheet aggregates with GAGs; and in the absence of any cytotoxicity effect, the quantity of peptide internalized into CHO cells increased 2 times with 1 Trp residue, 10 times with 2 Trp residues, and 20 times with 3 Trp residues, compared with +6 peptides with no Trp residues. Therefore, Trp residues represent molecular determinants in basic peptide sequences not only for direct membrane translocation but also for efficient endocytosis through GAGs."
https://openalex.org/W2052115777,"Surgery induced inflammation is a potent promoter of tumour recurrence and metastasis in colorectal cancer. The recently discovered family of Nox enzymes represent a major source of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are now heavily implicated in tumour cell metastasis. Interestingly, Nox enzymes can be ‘purposefully’ activated by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors which are present in abundance in the peri-operative window. As colon cancer cells express Nox enzymes and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), we hypothesised that LPS may potentiate the ability of colon cancer cells to metastasise via Nox enzyme mediated redox signalling. In support of this hypothesis, this paper demonstrates that LPS induces a significant, transient increase of endogenous ROS in SW480, SW620 and CT-26 colon cancer cells. This increase in LPS-induced ROS activity is completely abrogated by a Nox inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), Nox1 siRNA and an NF-κB inhibitor, Dihydrochloride. A significant increase in Nox1 and Nox2 protein expression occurs following LPS treatment. Inhibition of NF-κB also attenuates the increase of Nox1 and Nox2 protein expression. The sub-cellular location of LPS-induced ROS generation lies mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. LPS activates the PI3K/Akt pathway via Nox generated ROS and this signal is inhibited by DPI. This LPS activated Nox mechanism facilitates a significant increase in SW480 colon cancer cell adhesion to collagen I, which is inhibited by DPI, Nox1 siRNA and a PI3K inhibitor. Altogether, these data suggest that the LPS-Nox1 redox signalling axis plays a crucial role in facilitation of colon cancer cell adhesion, thus increasing the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells. Nox1 may represent a valuable target in which to prevent colon cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2101669740,"Mutation of the tumor suppressor p53 plays a major role in human carcinogenesis. Here we describe gene-targeted porcine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and live pigs carrying a latent TP53R167H mutant allele, orthologous to oncogenic human mutant TP53R175H and mouse Trp53R172H, that can be activated by Cre recombination. MSCs carrying the latent TP53R167H mutant allele were analyzed in vitro. Homozygous cells were p53 deficient, and on continued culture exhibited more rapid proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and resistance to the apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, all characteristic of cellular transformation. Cre mediated recombination activated the latent TP53R167H allele as predicted, and in homozygous cells expressed mutant p53-R167H protein at a level ten-fold greater than wild-type MSCs, consistent with the elevated levels found in human cancer cells. Gene targeted MSCs were used for nuclear transfer and fifteen viable piglets were produced carrying the latent TP53R167H mutant allele in heterozygous form. These animals will allow study of p53 deficiency and expression of mutant p53-R167H to model human germline, or spontaneous somatic p53 mutation. This work represents the first inactivation and mutation of the gatekeeper tumor suppressor gene TP53 in a non-rodent mammal."
https://openalex.org/W2049720180,"Data about the entire sperm DNA methylome are limited to two sperm donors whereas studies dealing with a greater number of subjects focused only on a few genes or were based on low resolution arrays. This implies that information about what we can consider as a normal sperm DNA methylome and whether it is stable among different normozoospermic individuals is still missing. The definition of the DNA methylation profile of normozoospermic men, the entity of inter-individual variability and the epigenetic characterization of quality-fractioned sperm subpopulations in the same subject (intra-individual variability) are relevant for a better understanding of pathological conditions. We addressed these questions by using the high resolution Infinium 450K methylation array and compared normal sperm DNA methylomes against somatic and cancer cells. Our study, based on the largest number of subjects (n = 8) ever considered for such a large number of CpGs (n = 487,517), provided clear evidence for i) a highly conserved DNA methylation profile among normozoospermic subjects; ii) a stable sperm DNA methylation pattern in different quality-fractioned sperm populations of the same individual. The latter finding is particularly relevant if we consider that different quality fractioned sperm subpopulations show differences in their structural features, metabolic and genomic profiles. We demonstrate, for the first time, that DNA methylation in normozoospermic men remains highly uniform regardless the quality of sperm subpopulations. In addition, our analysis provided both confirmatory and novel data concerning the sperm DNA methylome, including its peculiar features in respect to somatic and cancer cells. Our description about a highly polarized sperm DNA methylation profile, the clearly distinct genomic and functional organization of hypo- versus hypermethylated loci as well as the association of histone-enriched hypomethylated loci with embryonic development, which we now extended also to hypomethylated piRNAs-linked genes, provides solid basis for future basic and clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W2018300054,"Although the survival rate for early detected cancers is high, once a cancer metastasizes to bone, it is incurable. Interestingly, patients without visible metastases display abnormal bone formation and resorption, suggesting a link between primary cancers and the bone microenvironment prior to metastasis, and this link likely facilitates preparation of the pre-metastatic niche. We hypothesized that communication with the primary tumor would result in bone remodeling alterations, and that platelets could facilitate this communication. By using three tumor models, we demonstrate that primary tumor growth stimulates bone formation measured by microcomputed tomography. Further, platelet depletion prevented tumor-induced bone formation, highlighting the importance of platelets in the communication between tumors and the bone microenvironment. Finally, we determine that platelets sequester a variety of tumor-derived proteins, TGF-β1 and MMP-1 in particular, which regulate bone formation. Thus, our data reveal that platelets function as mediators of tumor-bone communication prior to metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2029441786,"Versatile peroxidase shares with manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase the ability to oxidize Mn(2+) and high redox potential aromatic compounds, respectively. Moreover, it is also able to oxidize phenols (and low redox potential dyes) at two catalytic sites, as shown by biphasic kinetics. A high efficiency site (with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and p-hydroquinone catalytic efficiencies of ∼70 and ∼700 s(-1) mM(-1), respectively) was localized at the same exposed Trp-164 responsible for high redox potential substrate oxidation (as shown by activity loss in the W164S variant). The second site, characterized by low catalytic efficiency (∼3 and ∼50 s(-1) mM(-1) for 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and p-hydroquinone, respectively) was localized at the main heme access channel. Steady-state and transient-state kinetics for oxidation of phenols and dyes at the latter site were improved when side chains of residues forming the heme channel edge were removed in single and multiple variants. Among them, the E140G/K176G, E140G/P141G/K176G, and E140G/W164S/K176G variants attained catalytic efficiencies for oxidation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) at the heme channel similar to those of the exposed tryptophan site. The heme channel enlargement shown by x-ray diffraction of the E140G, P141G, K176G, and E140G/K176G variants would allow a better substrate accommodation near the heme, as revealed by the up to 26-fold lower K(m) values (compared with native VP). The resulting interactions were shown by the x-ray structure of the E140G-guaiacol complex, which includes two H-bonds of the substrate with Arg-43 and Pro-139 in the distal heme pocket (at the end of the heme channel) and several hydrophobic interactions with other residues and the heme cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W2032075598,"LTF (lactotransferrin, also known as lactoferrin) is a key component of innate immune defense. It has recently been found to have anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity in different cancers. We previously reported LTF to be the most significantly downregulated gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens relative to normal nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues, and it was also negatively associated with the progression and metastasis of NPC. However, the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. In the current study, we revealed that LTF can suppress 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 expression via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun pathway and thus repress AKT signaling. We also showed that LTF interacts with keratin 18 (K18) and so blocks the formation of the K18-14-3-3 complex, leading to downregulation of K18-mediated AKT activation. Thus, LTF suppresses AKT signaling by two separate mechanisms, leading to inhibition of NPC tumorigenesis. This is the first report on the tumor suppressive effects of LTF through repression of AKT signaling in NPC. It suggests that both LTF and AKT signaling merit further study in the field of NPC research."
https://openalex.org/W2075731708,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) is among the most lethal malignancies. While research has implicated multiple genes in disease pathogenesis, identification of therapeutic leads has been difficult and the majority of currently available therapies provide only marginal benefit. To address this issue, our goal was to genomically characterize individual PAC patients to understand the range of aberrations that are occurring in each tumor. Because our understanding of PAC tumorigenesis is limited, evaluation of separate cases may reveal aberrations, that are less common but may provide relevant information on the disease, or that may represent viable therapeutic targets for the patient. We used next generation sequencing to assess global somatic events across 3 PAC patients to characterize each patient and to identify potential targets. This study is the first to report whole genome sequencing (WGS) findings in paired tumor/normal samples collected from 3 separate PAC patients. We generated on average 132 billion mappable bases across all patients using WGS, and identified 142 somatic coding events including point mutations, insertion/deletions, and chromosomal copy number variants. We did not identify any significant somatic translocation events. We also performed RNA sequencing on 2 of these patients' tumors for which tumor RNA was available to evaluate expression changes that may be associated with somatic events, and generated over 100 million mapped reads for each patient. We further performed pathway analysis of all sequencing data to identify processes that may be the most heavily impacted from somatic and expression alterations. As expected, the KRAS signaling pathway was the most heavily impacted pathway (P<0.05), along with tumor-stroma interactions and tumor suppressive pathways. While sequencing of more patients is needed, the high resolution genomic and transcriptomic information we have acquired here provides valuable information on the molecular composition of PAC and helps to establish a foundation for improved therapeutic selection."
https://openalex.org/W2118209956,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is difficult to eradicate and type III interferons (IFN-λ, composed of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29) are novel therapeutic candidates. We hypothesized that IFN-λ have immunomodulatory effects in HCV- infected individuals.We analyzed the expression of IFN-λ and its receptor (composed of IL-10R2 and IFN-λR subunits) in the blood and livers of patients with chronic (c)HCV infection compared to controls (those who cleared HCV by sustained virological response, SVR, and those with liver inflammation of non-viral origin, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH). We also compared the proliferative capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) obtained from healthy individuals and those with chronic HCV using a mixed leukocyte reaction combined with 3H-Td incorporation. In addition, the composition of the IFN-λ receptor (IFN-λR) on myeloid DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, PBMCs, and T cells was determined by FACS analysis.We report that the expression of IFN-λ protein in serum and mRNA in liver is increased in cHCV patients, but not in those with HCV SVR or NASH, compared to controls. Liver level of IFN-λR mirrored the expression of serum IFN-λ and was higher in cHCV, compared to controls and HCV-SVR patients, suggesting that elevation of IFN-λ and IFN-λR are HCV-dependent. We further identified that innate immune cell populations expressed complete IFN-λ receptor. In vitro, recombinant IFN-λ promoted differentiation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) into a phenotype with low T cell stimulatory capacity and high PD-L1 expression, which further promoted expansion of existing regulatory T cells. IFN-λ-DCs failed to induce de novo generation of regulatory T cells. The inhibitory capacity of IFN-λ-DCs was counteracted by recombinant IL-12 and by neutralization of the PD-1/PD-L1 system.Our novel findings of the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-λ contribute to the understanding of the anti-inflammatory and/or anti-viral potential of IFN-λ in cHCV."
https://openalex.org/W2152282656,"Background Ecologists are collecting extensive data concerning movements of animals in marine ecosystems. Such data need to be analysed with valid statistical methods to yield meaningful conclusions. Principal Findings We demonstrate methodological issues in two recent studies that reached similar conclusions concerning movements of marine animals (Nature 451∶1098; Science 332∶1551). The first study analysed vertical movement data to conclude that diverse marine predators (Atlantic cod, basking sharks, bigeye tuna, leatherback turtles and Magellanic penguins) exhibited “Lévy-walk-like behaviour”, close to a hypothesised optimal foraging strategy. By reproducing the original results for the bigeye tuna data, we show that the likelihood of tested models was calculated from residuals of regression fits (an incorrect method), rather than from the likelihood equations of the actual probability distributions being tested. This resulted in erroneous Akaike Information Criteria, and the testing of models that do not correspond to valid probability distributions. We demonstrate how this led to overwhelming support for a model that has no biological justification and that is statistically spurious because its probability density function goes negative. Re-analysis of the bigeye tuna data, using standard likelihood methods, overturns the original result and conclusion for that data set. The second study observed Lévy walk movement patterns by mussels. We demonstrate several issues concerning the likelihood calculations (including the aforementioned residuals issue). Re-analysis of the data rejects the original Lévy walk conclusion. Conclusions We consequently question the claimed existence of scaling laws of the search behaviour of marine predators and mussels, since such conclusions were reached using incorrect methods. We discourage the suggested potential use of “Lévy-like walks” when modelling consequences of fishing and climate change, and caution that any resulting advice to managers of marine ecosystems would be problematic. For reproducibility and future work we provide R source code for all calculations."
https://openalex.org/W2042558677,"In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the association between each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a phenotype is assessed statistically. To further explore genetic associations in GWAS, we considered two specific forms of biologically plausible SNP-SNP interactions, ‘SNP intersection’ and ‘SNP union,’ and analyzed the Crohn's Disease (CD) GWAS data of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium for these interactions using a limited form of logic regression. We found strong evidence of CD-association for 195 genes, identifying novel susceptibility genes (e.g., ISX, SLCO6A1, TMEM183A) as well as confirming many previously identified susceptibility genes in CD GWAS (e.g., IL23R, NOD2, CYLD, NKX2-3, IL12RB2, ATG16L1). Notably, 37 of the 59 chromosomal locations indicated for CD-association by a meta-analysis of CD GWAS, involving over 22,000 cases and 29,000 controls, were represented in the 195 genes, as well as some chromosomal locations previously indicated only in linkage studies, but not in GWAS. We repeated the analysis with two smaller GWASs from the Database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP): in spite of differences of populations and study power across the three datasets, we observed some consistencies across the three datasets. Notable examples included TMEM183A and SLCO6A1 which exhibited strong evidence consistently in our WTCCC and both of the dbGaP SNP-SNP interaction analyses. Examining these specific forms of SNP interactions could identify additional genetic associations from GWAS.

https://openalex.org/W2009657275,"Background Pharmacogenetics involves complex interactions of gene products affecting pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, but there is little information on the interaction of multiple genetic modifiers of drug response. Bucindolol is a β-blocker/sympatholytic agent whose efficacy is modulated by polymorphisms in the primary target (β1 adrenergic receptor [AR] Arg389 Gly on cardiac myocytes) and a secondary target modifier (α2C AR Ins [wild-type (Wt)] 322–325 deletion [Del] on cardiac adrenergic neurons). The major allele homozygotes and minor allele carriers of each polymorphism are respectively associated with efficacy enhancement and loss, creating the possibility for genotype combination interactions that can be measured by clinical trial methodology. Methodology In a 1,040 patient substudy of a bucindolol vs. placebo heart failure clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that combinations of β1389 and α2C322–325 polymorphisms are additive for both efficacy enhancement and loss. Additionally, norepinephrine (NE) affinity for β1389 AR variants was measured in human explanted left ventricles. Principal Findings The combination of β1389 Arg+α2C322–325 Wt major allele homozygotes (47% of the trial population) was non-additive for efficacy enhancement across six clinical endpoints, with an average efficacy increase of 1.70-fold vs. 2.32-fold in β1389 Arg homozygotes+α2C322–325 Del minor allele carriers. In contrast, the minor allele carrier combination (13% subset) exhibited additive efficacy loss. These disparate effects are likely due to the higher proportion (42% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.009) of high-affinity NE binding sites in β1389 Arg vs. Gly ARs, which converts α2CDel minor allele-associated NE lowering from a therapeutic liability to a benefit. Conclusions On combination, the two sets of AR polymorphisms 1) influenced bucindolol efficacy seemingly unpredictably but consistent with their pharmacologic interactions, and 2) identified subpopulations with enhanced (β1389 Arg homozygotes), intermediate (β1389 Gly carriers+α2C322–325 Wt homozygotes), and no (β1389 Gly carriers+α2C322–325 Del carriers) efficacy."

https://openalex.org/W2153722146,"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) induces regression of preestablished atherosclerosis in the ApoE–/– mouse. Understanding the mechanisms involved may help in identifying novel pathways associated with the regression of human disease. Animals were administered a 1% cholesterol diet for 12 wk, with 1% CLA supplementation from wk 8 to 12. ApoE–/– mice fed only the 1% cholesterol diet for 12 wk were employed as controls. Transcriptomic analysis of mouse aorta showed that many of the components of the IL-10 signaling pathway were modified during CLA-induced regression. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis showed increased IL-10 receptor expression, phosphorylation of STAT3, and downstream target gene expression in the aorta, alongside an increase in serum IL-10 (79.8±22.4 vs. 41.9±5.5 pg/ml, n=10; P<0.01). CLA -supplementation also increased IL-10 production in bone marrow-derived macrophages (143.6±28.6 vs. 94±5.6 pg/ml, n=5; P<0.05). To explore the mechanisms for altered IL-10 production, we examined the profile of monocyte/macrophage phenotype in the vessel wall, bone marrow, and spleen. CLA increased macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in vivo, increasing the population of Ly6Clo monocytes (29 vs. 77±14, n=5, P < 0.05) in the aorta. CLA had similar effects on monocytes/macrophages differentiated from marrow-derived progenitor cells and on splenocytes. The induction of IL-10 on CLA supplementation in this model may reflect a systemic alteration toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, which, in turn promotes increased vascular infiltration by Ly6Clo monocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2089029834,"The approximately 300 (298, 95% CI: 152–581) elephants in the Lower Kinabatangan Managed Elephant Range in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo are a priority sub-population for Borneo's total elephant population (2,040, 95% CI: 1,184–3,652). Habitat loss and human-elephant conflict are recognized as the major threats to Bornean elephant survival. In the Kinabatangan region, human settlements and agricultural development for oil palm drive an intense fragmentation process. Electric fences guard against elephant crop raiding but also remove access to suitable habitat patches. We conducted expert opinion-based least-cost analyses, to model the quantity and configuration of available suitable elephant habitat in the Lower Kinabatangan, and called this the Elephant Habitat Linkage. At 184 km2, our estimate of available habitat is 54% smaller than the estimate used in the State's Elephant Action Plan for the Lower Kinabatangan Managed Elephant Range (400 km2). During high flood levels, available habitat is reduced to only 61 km2. As a consequence, short-term elephant densities are likely to surge during floods to 4.83 km−2 (95% CI: 2.46–9.41), among the highest estimated for forest-dwelling elephants in Asia or Africa. During severe floods, the configuration of remaining elephant habitat and the surge in elephant density may put two villages at elevated risk of human-elephant conflict. Lower Kinabatangan elephants are vulnerable to the natural disturbance regime of the river due to their limited dispersal options. Twenty bottlenecks less than one km wide throughout the Elephant Habitat Linkage, have the potential to further reduce access to suitable habitat. Rebuilding landscape connectivity to isolated habitat patches and to the North Kinabatangan Managed Elephant Range (less than 35 km inland) are conservation priorities that would increase the quantity of available habitat, and may work as a mechanism to allow population release, lower elephant density, reduce human-elephant conflict, and enable genetic mixing."
https://openalex.org/W2022696841,"Machine learning neuroimaging researchers have often relied on regularization techniques when classifying MRI images. Although these were originally introduced to deal with ""ill-posed"" problems it is rare to find studies that evaluate the ill-posedness of MRI image classification problems. In addition, to avoid the effects of the ""curse of dimensionality"" very often dimension reduction is applied to the data.Baseline structural MRI data from cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database were used in this study. We evaluated here the ill-posedness of this classification problem across different dimensions and sample sizes and its relationship to the performance of regularized logistic regression (RLR), linear support vector machine (SVM) and linear regression classifier (LRC). In addition, these methods were compared with their principal components space counterparts.In voxel space the prediction performance of all methods increased as sample sizes increased. They were not only relatively robust to the increase of dimension, but they often showed improvements in accuracy. We linked this behavior to improvements in conditioning of the linear kernels matrices. In general the RLR and SVM performed similarly. Surprisingly, the LRC was often very competitive when the linear kernel matrices were best conditioned. Finally, when comparing these methods in voxel and principal component spaces, we did not find large differences in prediction performance.We analyzed the problem of classifying AD MRI images from the perspective of linear ill-posed problems. We demonstrate empirically the impact of the linear kernel matrix conditioning on different classifiers' performance. This dependence is characterized across sample sizes and dimensions. In this context we also show that increased dimensionality does not necessarily degrade performance of machine learning methods. In general, this depends on the nature of the problem and the type of machine learning method."
https://openalex.org/W2080512822,"ADNP is vital for embryonic development. Is this function conserved for the homologous protein ADNP2?Down-regulation/silencing of ADNP or ADNP2 in zebrafish embryos or mouse erythroleukemia cells inhibited erythroid maturation, with ADNP directly associating with the β-globin locus control region.ADNPs are novel molecular regulators of erythropoiesis.New regulators of globin synthesis are suggested. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) and its homologue ADNP2 belong to a homeodomain, the zinc finger-containing protein family. ADNP is essential for mouse embryonic brain formation. ADNP2 is associated with cell survival, but its role in embryogenesis has not been evaluated. Here, we describe the use of the zebrafish model to elucidate the developmental roles of ADNP and ADNP2. Although we expected brain defects, we were astonished to discover that the knockdown zebrafish embryos were actually lacking blood and suffered from defective hemoglobin production. Evolutionary conservation was established using mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, a well studied erythropoiesis model, in which silencing of ADNP or ADNP2 produced similar results as in zebrafish. Exogenous RNA encoding ADNP/ADNP2 rescued the MEL cell undifferentiated state, demonstrating phenotype specificity. Brg1, an ADNP-interacting chromatin-remodeling protein involved in erythropoiesis through regulation of the globin locus, was shown here to interact also with ADNP2. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed recruitment of ADNP, similar to Brg1, to the mouse β-globin locus control region in MEL cells. This recruitment was apparently diminished upon dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced erythrocyte differentiation compared with the nondifferentiated state. Importantly, exogenous RNA encoding ADNP/ADNP2 significantly increased β-globin expression in MEL cells in the absence of any other differentiation factors. Taken together, our results reveal an ancestral role for the ADNP protein family in maturation and differentiation of the erythroid lineage, associated with direct regulation of β-globin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1999097921,"Caspase-8 has an important role as an initiator caspase during death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, it has been reported to contribute to the regulation of cell fate in various types of cells including T-cells. In this report, we show that caspase-8 has an essential role in cell survival in mouse T-lymphoma-derived L5178Y cells. The knockdown of caspase-8 expression decreased the growth rate and increased cell death, both of which were induced by the absence of protease activity of procaspase-8. The cell death was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, caspase activation, and autophagosome formation. The cell death was inhibited completely by treatment with ROS scavengers, but only partly by treatment with caspase inhibitors, expression of Bcl-xL, and knockdown of caspase-3 or Atg-7 which completely inhibits apoptosis or autophagosome formation, respectively, indicating that apoptosis and autophagy-associated cell death are induced simultaneously by the knockdown of caspase-8 expression. Further analysis indicated that RIP1 and RIP3 regulate this multiple cell death, because the cell death as well as ROS production was completely inhibited by not only treatment with the RIP1 inhibitor necrostatin-1, but also by knockdown of RIP3. Thus, in the absence of protease activity of procaspase-8, RIP1 and RIP3 simultaneously induce not only nonapoptotic cell death conceivably including autophagic cell death and necroptosis but also apoptosis through ROS production in mouse T-lymphoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975201714,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key enzyme for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis, and can be found either intracellularly (iNAMPT) or extracellularly (eNAMPT). Studies have shown that both iNAMPT and eNAMPT are implicated in aging and age-related diseases/disorders in the peripheral system. However, their functional roles in aged brain remain to be established. Here we showed that upon aging, NAMPT level increased in serum but decreased in brain, decreased in cortex and hippocampus but remained unchanged in cerebellum and striatum in brain, and increased in microglia but likely decreased in neuron. Accordingly, total NAD (tNAD) level significantly decreased in hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum in aged brain. Application of recombinant NAMPT, mimicking the elevated serum NAMPT level, enhanced the susceptibility of cerebral endothelial cells to ischemic injury, while inhibition of iNAMPT by FK866, a specific inhibitor, reduced intracellular NAD level and induced neuronal death. Taken together, we have revealed a region- and cell-specific change of NAMPT level in brain and serum upon aging, deduced its potential consequences, which suggests that NAMPT is a regulatory factor in aging and age-related brain diseases."

Caveolin-3 (cav-3), an integral membrane protein, is a building block of caveolae as well as a regulator of a number of physiological processes by facilitating the formation of multiprotein signaling complexes. We report that the expression of cav-3 in insect (Sf9) cells induces caveola formation, comparable in size with those observed in native tissue. We have also purified the recombinant cav-3 determining that it forms an oligomer of ∼220 kDa. We present the first three-dimensional structure for cav-3 (using transmission electron microscopy and single particle analysis methods) and show that nine cav-3 monomers assemble to form a complex that is toroidal in shape, ~16.5 nm in diameter and ~ 5.5 nm in height. Labeling experiments and reconstitution of the purified cav-3 into liposomes have allowed a proposal for the orientation of the protein with respect to the membrane. We have identified multiple caveolin-binding motifs within the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) sequence employing a bioinformatic analysis. We have then shown experimentally that there is a direct interaction between recombinant cav-3 nonamers and purified RyR1 homotetramers that would imply that at least one of the predicted cav-3-binding sites is exposed within the fully assembled RyR1 structure. The cav-3 three-dimensional model provides new insights as to how a cav-3 oligomer can bind multiple partners in close proximity to form signaling complexes. Furthermore, a direct interaction with RyR1 suggests a possible role for cav-3 as a modifier of muscle excitation-contraction coupling and/or for localization of the receptor to regions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W2087119886,"Tssc3 is a maternally expressed/paternally silenced imprinted gene. Recent evidence suggests that the loss of TSSC3 results in placental overgrowth in mice. These findings showed that the TSSC3 gene functions as a negative regulator of placental growth. In this study, we describe the function of TSSC3 and its signaling pathway in mouse trophoblast stem (TS) cell differentiation. First of all, we tested Tssc3 expression levels in TS cells. TS cells expressed Tssc3, and its expression level was the highest from day 1 to 4 but was down-regulated at day 5 after the induction of differentiation. Overexpression of TSSC3 in TS cells up-regulated Gcm1 and Mash2, which are marker genes of mouse trophoblast differentiation. Down-regulation of TSSC3 by siRNA enhanced Pl1 and Tpbpa expression in TS cells cultured under stem cell conditions, suggesting the contribution of TSSC3 to the differentiation from TS to trophoblast progenitors and/or labyrinth trophoblasts. TSSC3 activated the PI3K/AKT pathway through binding with phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids and enhanced the activity of a promoter containing an E-box structure, which is the binding sequence of the Mash2 downstream target gene promoter. PI3K inhibitor suppressed the promoter activity induced by TSSC3. TSSC3 induced Sp1 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Nuclear Sp1 activated the Mash2 transcription by Sp1 binding with a consensus Sp1-binding motif. This is the first report describing that TSSC3 plays an important role in the differentiation from TS to trophoblast progenitors and/or labyrinth trophoblasts through the TSSC3/PI3K/AKT/MASH2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2039482622,"We present a comprehensive numerical study of spiral- and scroll-wave dynamics in a state-of-the-art mathematical model for human ventricular tissue with fiber rotation, transmural heterogeneity, myocytes, and fibroblasts. Our mathematical model introduces fibroblasts randomly, to mimic diffuse fibrosis, in the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov (TNNP) model for human ventricular tissue; the passive fibroblasts in our model do not exhibit an action potential in the absence of coupling with myocytes; and we allow for a coupling between nearby myocytes and fibroblasts. Our study of a single myocyte-fibroblast (MF) composite, with a single myocyte coupled to N(f) fibroblasts via a gap-junctional conductance G(gap), reveals five qualitatively different responses for this composite. Our investigations of two-dimensional domains with a random distribution of fibroblasts in a myocyte background reveal that, as the percentage P(f) of fibroblasts increases, the conduction velocity of a plane wave decreases until there is conduction failure. If we consider spiral-wave dynamics in such a medium we find, in two dimensions, a variety of nonequilibrium states, temporally periodic, quasiperiodic, chaotic, and quiescent, and an intricate sequence of transitions between them; we also study the analogous sequence of transitions for three-dimensional scroll waves in a three-dimensional version of our mathematical model that includes both fiber rotation and transmural heterogeneity. We thus elucidate random-fibrosis-induced nonequilibrium transitions, which lead to conduction block for spiral waves in two dimensions and scroll waves in three dimensions. We explore possible experimental implications of our mathematical and numerical studies for plane-, spiral-, and scroll-wave dynamics in cardiac tissue with fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1974110792,"Aim To explore the association between genetic polymorphisms of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and susceptibility, chemotherapy response rate and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method This is a prospective study in which 562 patients with NSCLC and 764 healthy controls were enrolled. Three RAGE genetic polymorphisms, namely, −429T/C, −374T/A and 82G/S were genotyped. Platinum-based chemotherapy was given to 432 subjects with advanced inoperable NSCLC and their responses to chemotherapy were evaluated. Results All the polymorphic genotypes of RAGE polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility for NSCLC. Only the 82G/S polymorphisms denoted a significant difference between responders and non-responders to chemotherapy. The 82SS genotype and 82S allele distribution not only increased the NSCLC risk, but also was associated with a lower chemotherapy response rate and poor prognosis, indicated by overall survival and progression free survival. Conclusion The 82G/S genetic polymorphism of RAGE gene might be used as a genetic marker to screen for patients sensitive to thermotherapy and to predict the prognosis of NSCLC."

https://openalex.org/W2102792874,"Preservation of both the integrity and fluidity of biological membranes is a critical cellular homeostatic function. Signaling pathways that govern lipid bilayer fluidity have long been known in bacteria, yet no such pathways have been identified in eukaryotes. Here we identify mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae whose growth is differentially influenced by its two principal unsaturated fatty acids, oleic and palmitoleic acid. Strains deficient in the core components of the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, a MAP kinase pathway dependent on both Pkc1 (yeast's sole protein kinase C) and Rho1 (the yeast RhoA-like small GTPase), were among those inhibited by palmitoleate yet stimulated by oleate. A single GEF (Tus1) and a single GAP (Sac7) of Rho1 were also identified, neither of which participate in the CWI pathway. In contrast, key components of the CWI pathway, such as Rom2, Bem2 and Rlm1, failed to influence fatty acid sensitivity. The differential influence of palmitoleate and oleate on growth of key mutants correlated with changes in membrane fluidity measured by fluorescence anisotropy of TMA-DPH, a plasma membrane-bound dye. This work provides the first evidence for the existence of a signaling pathway that enables eukaryotic cells to control membrane fluidity, a requirement for division, differentiation and environmental adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1978916450,"Recovery from stroke is limited, in part, by an inhibitory environment in the postischemic brain, but factors preventing successful remodeling are not well known. Using cultured cortical neurons from mice, brain endothelial cells, and a mouse model of ischemic stroke, we show that signaling from the axon guidance molecule Sema3A via eicosanoid second messengers can contribute to this inhibitory environment. Either 90 nM recombinant Sema3A, or the 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) metabolites 12-HETE and 12-HPETE at 300 nM, block axon extension in neurons compared to solvent controls, and decrease tube formation in endothelial cells. The Sema3A effect is reversed by inhibiting 12/15-LOX, and neurons derived from 12/15-LOX-knockout mice are insensitive to Sema3A. Following middle cerebral artery occlusion to induce stroke in mice, immunohistochemistry shows both Sema3A and 12/15-LOX are increased in the cortex up to 2 wk. To determine whether a Sema3A-dependent damage pathway is activated following ischemia, we injected recombinant Sema3A into the striatum. Sema3A alone did not cause injury in normal brains. But when injected into postischemic brains, Sema3A increased cortical damage by 79%, and again, this effect was reversed by 12/15-LOX inhibition.

However examination of tissues from mice and fish that are homozygous for mutant p53 surprisingly showed that the protein was present only at low levels except in the tumors that arose in these animals. The mutant protein did accumulate, however, following treatment with ionizing radiation in the same tissues in which the wild-type protein is induced. Here we study in detail the accumulation of mutant and wild-type p53 proteins following ionizing radiation in zebrafish embryos. We found that the mutant protein was induced by lower levels of radiation and reached higher levels than the wild-type protein. Morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish homologs of Mdm2 and Mdm4 caused dramatic accumulation of mutant p53 protein. The most remarkable results were observed by examining p53 protein levels over an extended time course. Mutant p53 protein increased and persisted for days after irradiation and this was accompanied by persistent elevation of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX), implying that the resolution of DNA damage signaling in these embryos is severely compromised by mutations in p53. Thus mutation in p53 results in an exaggerated and persistent damage response, which could in turn drive the process of cancer development as high levels of mutant p53 can act as an oncoprotein to drive invasion and metastasis."

Of these P450 enzymes, CYP26A1 appears to be the main isoform responsible for both atRA clearance and formation of 4-OH-RA in human liver (13.Thatcher J.E. Zelter A. Isoherranen N.

CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 have also been identified as the key enzymes that regulate atRA metabolism in other tissues during development and in adulthood (11.White J.A. Beckett-Jones B. Guo Y.D.

The oxidative metabolism of atRA by CYP26A1 is believed to be the first step in its degradation and inactivation (14.Duester G. Retinoic acid synthesis and signaling during early organogenesis.Cell. 2008; 134: 921-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). However, the main atRA metabolites, 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA, also bind to the three RAR isoforms with affinities similar to atRA (16.Idres N. Marill J. Flexor M.A. Chabot G.G.

Formation of metabolites from atRA by CYP26A1 also appears to be required for differentiation of P19 EC cells into neurons, and for atRA-induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells (19.Sonneveld E. van den Brink C.E. Tertoolen L.G. van der Burg B. van der Saag P.T. Retinoic acid hydroxylase (CYP26) is a key enzyme in neuronal differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells.Dev.

CYP26A1 knockout embryonic stem cells exhibit reduced differentiation and growth arrest in response to retinoic acid.Dev. Biol. 2008; 315: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These data suggest that metabolites of atRA may be important in retinoid function when sufficient concentrations are reached in vivo. However, transgenic animal studies have shown that CYP26 enzymes are required for removal of atRA rather than for formation of active metabolites during mouse development (21.Niederreither K. Abu-Abed S. Schuhbaur B. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Dollé P. Genetic evidence that oxidative derivatives of retinoic acid are not involved in retinoid signaling during mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The hydroxylation of atRA to 4-OH-RA results in the formation of a chiral center (Fig. 1) but all studies characterizing formation of 4-OH-RA and its activity have been conducted using racemic 4-OH-RA. Because formation of 4-OH-RA could be stereospecific and the biological activity may reside in a single 4-OH-RA enantiomer, understanding the functional role(s) of atRA metabolites requires characterization of the stereochemical course of metabolism. In addition, stereospecificity of the enzymes involved in RA biotransformation may help in better understanding of the structure-function of the proteins involved in regulating RA homeostasis. Stereoselectivity appears to be a key characteristic of retinoid biotransformation. Hydroxylation of retinol in F9 cells results predominantly in the formation of (4S)-OH-retinol (22.Achkar C.C. Derguini F. Blumberg B. Langston A. Levin A.A. Speck J. Evans R.M. Bolado Jr., J. Nakanishi K. Buck J. Gudas L.J. 4-Oxoretinol, a new natural ligand and transactivator of the retinoic acid receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4879-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in the firefly squid, the visual pigment is (4R)-OH-retinal (23.Katsuta Y. Ito M. Yoshihara K. Nakanishi K. Kikkawa T.

Chem. 1994; 59: 6917-6921Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mouse and zebrafish retinol saturase selectively forms (R)-all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol, and the biological activity (adipocyte differentiation and RAR activation) of this product resides in the (R)-enantiomer (24.Moise A.R. Domínguez M. Alvarez S. Alvarez R. Schupp M. Cristancho A.G. Kiser P.D. de Lera A.R. Lazar M.A. Palczewski K. Stereospecificity of retinol saturase. Absolute configuration, synthesis, and biological evaluation of dihydroretinoids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 1154-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on the observed stereoselectivity associated with other retinoids and the tight binding of atRA to CYP26A1, it was hypothesized that formation of 4-OH-RA by CYP26A1 would be stereoselective. To test this hypothesis, a chiral column HPLC method was developed to separate the 4-OH-RA enantiomers, standards of the (4S)- and (4R)-OH-RA enantiomers were synthesized, and the formation of 4-OH-RA enantiomers by CYP26A1, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 enzymes was characterized. The formation of 4-OH-RA by CYP26A1 was stereoselective resulting in formation of (4S)-OH-RA, whereas the other P450s formed both 4-OH-RA enantiomers with varying stereoselectivities. (4S)-OH-RA was also a better substrate of CYP26A1 than (4R)-OH-RA resulting in formation of different metabolites and suggesting that the observed stereoselectivity may have broader biological importance. The 4-OH-RA enantiomers were separated using an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA) 1200 series HPLC system equipped with a Chiralcel OD-RH column (5 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm), an Agilent temperature controlled auto-sampler, a multiple wavelength detector, and HP Chemstation software. The mobile phase flow was 0.17 ml/min. A linear gradient from initial 50:50 water:acetonitrile for 14 min to 20:80 over 10 min was used, followed by 20:80 water:acetonitrile for 10 min. Analytes were quantified by determining the UV absorbance at 360 nm. CYP26A1 microsomes were prepared and rat reductase was expressed and purified as previously described (13.Thatcher J.E. Zelter A.

All incubations were conducted in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C and initiated by addition of NADPH (1 mm final concentration). The reactions were quenched and metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate as described previously (25.Lutz J.D. Dixit V. Yeung C.K. Dickmann L.J. Zelter A. Thatcher J.E. Nelson W.L.

The stereoselective formation of 4-OH-RA by P450 enzymes (5 nm) was characterized with 10 nm to 40 μm atRA as a substrate. P450 reductase (10 nm) was added to incubations with CYP26A1. The product formation data were analyzed and the Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to the data using GraphPad Prism version 5 (La Jolla, CA). The metabolites formed from (4R)-OH-RA and (4S)-OH-RA by CYP26A1 were identified using LC-MS/MS conditions identical to those previously reported for racemic 4-OH-RA (15.Topletz A.R. Thatcher J.E. Zelter A. Lutz J.D. Tay S. Nelson W.L. Isoherranen N. Comparison of the function and expression of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, the two retinoic acid hydroxylases.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Five pmol of CYP26A1 and 10 pmol of P450 reductase were incubated with 1 μm of each enantiomer in 1 ml of potassium phosphate (100 mm, pH 7.4) buffer, and samples were extracted using ethyl acetate as described (15.Topletz A.R. Thatcher J.E. Zelter A. Lutz J.D. Tay S. Nelson W.L. Isoherranen N. Comparison of the function and expression of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, the two retinoic acid hydroxylases.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The time course of (4R)-OH-RA and (4S)-OH-RA depletion by CYP26A1 was determined at six substrate concentrations between 2 and 250 nm using a P450 reductase to CYP26A1 ratio of 2:1 (2 nm of P450 in each incubation), in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. All incubations were conducted under red light in triplicate and the experiments were repeated three times on separate days. The reactions were initiated by addition of NADPH (1 mm final concentration). At 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 min, 0.5-ml aliquots were collected and quenched with 3 ml of cold ethyl acetate. For a separate experiment at 2.5 nm substrate concentration, 1-ml aliquots were collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 min. As an internal standard, 20 μl of a 2.5 μm solution of 4-oxo-RA-D3 (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario) in ethanol was added, and samples were extracted as previously described (15.Topletz A.R. Thatcher J.E. Zelter A. Lutz J.D. Tay S. Nelson W.L. Isoherranen N. Comparison of the function and expression of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, the two retinoic acid hydroxylases.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 4-OH-RA enantiomers were analyzed using an AB Sciex API 5500 Q/LIT mass spectrometer equipped with an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC and an Agilent Zorbax C18 column (3.5 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm). The analytes were separated using a 10-min linear gradient from initial 5:95, acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous formic acid to a final 95:5, acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous formic acid. Analytes were detected using positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry with the declustering potential set to 80 V, collision energy to 33 eV (4-OH-RA) and 35 eV (4-oxo-RA-D3), and collision cell exit potential to 13 V (4-OH-RA) and 2 V (4-oxo-RA-D3). The parent fragment MS/MS transitions of m/z 299.2 → 121.2 Da for (4R)-OH-RA and (4S)-OH-RA and m/z 300.2 → 226.2 Da for 4-oxo-RA-D3 were used. The data were analyzed using Analyst software, and the 4-OH-RA concentration was plotted as a function of time. The concentration versus time data were log-linear for 2 min and only data up to 2 min were used. Points for which the concentration was below the limit of quantification of the assay (0.1 nm) were not included in the analysis. The depletion rate constant was obtained from the log-linear fit to the equation: C = C0e−kdept, in which C equals 4-OH-RA enantiomer concentration at a given time t, C0 the initial concentration of 4-OH-RA enantiomers, and kdep the depletion rate constant as described previously (25.Lutz J.D.

Pharmacol. 2009; 77: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The maximum efficiency of depletion, the intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km), was calculated as kdep, max divided by the protein concentration as described (25.Lutz J.D. Dixit V. Yeung C.K. Dickmann L.J. Zelter A. Thatcher J.E. Nelson W.L. Isoherranen N. Expression and functional characterization of cytochrome P450 26A1, a retinoic acid hydroxylase.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 77: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All nonlinear fits were done using GraphPad Prism version 5 and values are reported as mean ± S.E. The kinetics of the formation of 4-oxo-RA and 4,16-OH2-RA were analyzed from (4R)-OH-RA and (4S)-OH-RA incubations, respectively, using identical LC-MS conditions as described (15.Topletz A.R. Thatcher J.E. Zelter A. Lutz J.D. Tay S. Nelson W.L. Isoherranen N. Comparison of the function and expression of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, the two retinoic acid hydroxylases.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2 pmol of CYP26A1 and 4 pmol of P450 reductase were incubated with 5–150 nm of each enantiomer in 1 ml of potassium phosphate (100 mm, pH 7.4) buffer, and samples were extracted using ethyl acetate. For 4-oxo-RA quantification a standard curve using a 4-oxo-RA standard was used and formation velocity was measured. The formation of 4,16-OH2-RA from (4S)-OH-RA was determined using relative quantification of the 4,16-OH2-RA peak height to internal standard ratio as a function of (4S)-OH-RA concentration. The affinity (Kd) of the 4-OH-RA enantiomers to CYP26A1 was determined by fitting the Morrison equation (tight binding equation, Equation 2) to the data as previously described for atRA binding to CYP26A1 (25.Lutz J.D. Dixit V. Yeung C.K. Dickmann L.J. Zelter A. Thatcher J.E. Nelson W.L. Isoherranen N. Expression and functional characterization of cytochrome P450 26A1, a retinoic acid hydroxylase.Biochem.

The overall pathway for synthesis of 4-OH-RA enantiomers from methyl 4-oxo-retinoate is shown in Fig. 1. The synthesis of the 4-dimethylaminocinnamoate esters of methyl 4-OH-retinoate for CD spectroscopy is also shown. All syntheses are described in detail under the supplemental Data. CD samples were prepared by dissolving weighed amounts of 4-dimethylaminocinnamoate esters (Fig. 1) of the enantiomeric methyl 4-hydroxyretinoates in acetonitrile to make 200 μm solutions (100 μg/ml). Spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a JASCO J715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Corp., Tokyo, Japan) using a 0.10-cm path length cell with a nitrogen flow rate of 4 liters/min. The wavelength and degree ellipticity scales were calibrated using a reference (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid ammonium salt sample assuming that the (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid ammonium salt maximum corresponds to [ϴ]290.5 = +7910 (28.Takakuwa T. Konno T. Meguro H. A new standard substance for calibration of circular dichroism. Ammonium d10 camphorsulfonate.Anal. Sci. 1985; 1: 215-218Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To minimize the effects of a possible photoisomerization, only a single scan for each spectrum was collected at a scan rate of 100 nm/min with a 2 nm bandwidth and a 0.2-nm step resolution over the wavelength range of 200–500 nm. The collected spectra were trimmed at a dynode voltage of 650 V (where required) prior to baseline subtraction (acetonitrile) and computationally smoothed using a two point fast Fourier transformation filter function (FFT filter) included within JASCO software (Spectra Manager 1.53.04). The raw ellipticity data (mdeg) were normalized by dividing them by the UV visible absorbance of the solutions at λmax (356 nm). A CYP26A1 homology model was made using Modeler (29.Eswar N.

The homology model was built using the amino acid sequence of human CYP26A1 (NCBI sequence number NP_000774.2). Two cytochrome P450 crystal structures, cyanobacterial CYP120A1 (PDB code 2VE3 (31.Kühnel K. Ke N. Cryle M.J. Sligar S.G. Schuler M.A. Schlichting I.

The CYP120A1 structure and the homology model were aligned and heme and atRA in the CYP120A1 structure were roughly docked to the homology model using PyMOL version 1.2 (DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA). To model the predominant structure in solution, molecular dynamics simulations were performed of the complex using GROMACS version 4.07 (33.Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. Drunen R. GROMACS.

The most prevalent concurrent conditions with CC were hemorrhoids (7.6%), diverticular disease (5.9%), ano-rectal hemorrhage (4.7%), irritable bowel syndrome (3.5%) and fecal impaction (2%). When adjusted for ascertainment bias, the most notable associations with CC were Hirschsprung's disease, fecal impaction and ano-rectal conditions such as fissure, fistula, hemorrhage and ulcers.Chronic constipation is associated with several concurrent conditions of variable risk and prevalence.

Whether DNA damage-induced p53 activity can contribute to senescence- or apoptosis-associated pro-tumorigenic inflammation is unknown. Recently, we generated a p53 knock-out rat via homologous recombination in rat embryonic stem cells. Here we show that in a rat model of inflammation-associated hepatocarcinogenesis, heterozygous deficiency of p53 resulted in attenuated inflammatory responses and ameliorated hepatic cirrhosis and tumorigenesis. Chronic administration of hepatocarcinogenic compound, diethylnitrosamine, led to persistent DNA damage and sustained induction of p53 protein in the wild-type livers, and much less induction in p53 heterozygous livers. Sustained p53 activation subsequent to DNA damage was accompanied by apoptotic rather than senescent hepatic injury, which gave rise to the hepatic inflammatory responses. In contrast, the non-hepatocarcinogenic agent, carbon tetrachloride, failed to induce p53, and caused a similar degree of chronic hepatic inflammation and cirrhosis in wild type and p53 heterozygous rats. These results suggest that although p53 is usually regarded as a tumor suppressor, its constant activation can promote pro-tumorigenic inflammation, especially in livers exposed to agents that inflict lasting mutagenic DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2042023944,"EEG/MEG source localization based on a ""distributed solution"" is severely underdetermined, because the number of sources is much larger than the number of measurements. In particular, this makes the solution strongly affected by sensor noise. A new way to constrain the problem is presented. By using the anatomical basis of spherical harmonics (or spherical splines) instead of single dipoles the dimensionality of the inverse solution is greatly reduced without sacrificing the quality of the data fit. The smoothness of the resulting solution reduces the surface bias and scatter of the sources (incoherency) compared to the popular minimum-norm algorithms where single-dipole basis is used (MNE, depth-weighted MNE, dSPM, sLORETA, LORETA, IBF) and allows to efficiently reduce the effect of sensor noise. This approach, termed Harmony, performed well when applied to experimental data (two exemplars of early evoked potentials) and showed better localization precision and solution coherence than the other tested algorithms when applied to realistically simulated data."
https://openalex.org/W2113087122,"αA-Crystallin (αA) and αB-crystallin (αB), the two prominent members of the small heat shock family of proteins are considered to be two subunits of one multimeric protein, α-crystallin, within the ocular lens. Outside of the ocular lens, however, αA and αB are known to be two independent proteins, with mutually exclusive expression in many tissues. This dichotomous view is buoyed by the high expression of αA and αB in the lens and their co-fractionation from lens extracts as one multimeric entity, α-crystallin. To understand the biological function(s) of each of these two proteins, it is important to investigate the biological basis of this perceived dichotomy; in this report, we address the question whether αA and αB exist as independent proteins in the ocular lens. Discontinuous sucrose density gradient fractionation and immunoconfocal localization reveal that in early developing rat lens αA is a membrane-associated small heat shock protein similar to αB but with remarkable differences. Employing an established protocol, we demonstrate that αB predominantly sediments with rough endoplasmic reticulum, whereas αA fractionates with smooth membranes. These biochemical observations were corroborated with immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Importantly, in the rat heart also, which does not contain αA, αB fractionates with rough endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that αA has no influence on the distribution of αB. These data demonstrate presence of αA and αB in two separate subcellular membrane compartments, pointing to their independent existence in the developing ocular lens."
https://openalex.org/W2043366457,"The skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the t-tubular membrane serves as the Ca(2+) channel and voltage sensor for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, triggering Ca(2+) release via the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The two proteins appear to be physically linked, and both the α(1S) and β(1a) subunits of the DHPR are essential for EC coupling. Within α(1S), cytoplasmic domains of importance include the I-II loop (to which β(1a) binds), the II-III and III-IV loops, and the C terminus. However, the spatial relationship of these domains to one another has not been established. Here, we have taken the approach of measuring FRET between fluorescent proteins inserted into pairs of α(1S) cytoplasmic domains. Expression of these constructs in dyspedic (RyR1 null) and dysgenic (α(1S) null) myotubes was used to test for function and targeting to plasma membrane/SR junctions and to test whether the presence of RyR1 caused altered FRET. We found that in the absence of RyR1, measureable FRET occurred between the N terminus and C terminus (residue 1636), and between the II-III loop (residue 626) and both the N and C termini; the I-II loop (residue 406) showed weak FRET with the II-III loop but not with the N terminus. Association with RyR1 caused II-III loop FRET to decrease with the C terminus and increase with the N terminus and caused I-II loop FRET to increase with both the II-III loop and N terminus. Overall, RyR1 appears to cause a substantial reorientation of the cytoplasmic α(1S) domains consistent with their becoming more closely packed."
https://openalex.org/W2061454384,"The brain is one of the most studied and highly complex systems in the biological world. While much research has concentrated on studying the brain directly, our focus is the structure of the brain itself: at its core an interconnected network of nodes (neurons). A better understanding of the structural connectivity of the brain should elucidate some of its functional properties. In this paper we analyze the connectome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Consisting of only 302 neurons, it is one of the better-understood neural networks. Using a Laplacian Matrix of the 279-neuron “giant component” of the network, we use an eigenvalue counting function to look for fractal-like self similarity. This matrix representation is also used to plot visualizations of the neural network in eigenfunction coordinates. Small-world properties of the system are examined, including average path length and clustering coefficient. We test for localization of eigenfunctions, using graph energy and spacial variance on these functions. To better understand results, all calculations are also performed on random networks, branching trees, and known fractals, as well as fractals which have been “rewired” to have small-world properties. We propose algorithms for generating Laplacian matrices of each of these graphs."

In order to reduce further loss of biodiversity and maintain productive and sustainable ecosystems, understanding the ecological mechanisms underlying species invasions and avoiding potentially harmful effects on native communities is urgently needed, but largely lacking. We here demonstrate, by means of hydroacoustics and advanced spatial modelling, how native fish species as a result of previous exposure to native predators may successfully respond to invasive novel predators through a complicated game of hide and seek, minimizing spatio-temporal overlap with predators, and potentially facilitating coexistence between native prey species (Galaxiids) and introduced novel predators (Salmonids) in a deep Andean lake, Patagonia."
https://openalex.org/W1979029891,"Antibiotics with novel and/or multiple targets are highly desirable in the face of the steady rise of clinical antibiotic resistance. We have screened and identified small molecules, typified by the compound TPI1609-10 (aka SM10), with antibiotic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. SM10 was screened in vitro to bind branched Holliday junction intermediates of homologous recombination and tyrosine recombinase-mediated recombination; thus, the cellular targets of the small molecules were expected to include the RuvABC Holliday junction resolvasome and the XerCD complex involved in proper segregation of replicated chromosomes to daughter cells. SM10 indeed induces DNA damage and filamentation in E. coli. However, SM10 also induces envelope stress and causes increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. In addition, SM10 has similar effects to endogenously-induced envelope stress via overproducing outer membrane proteins (OmpC and OmpF), which also induces the SOS response, chromosome fragmentation, and production of reactive oxygen species. The synergy between SM10, and cerulenin, a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, together with the SM10 hypersensitivity of cpx and rpoE mutants, further support that SM10's mode of action damages membrane damage. The lethality of SM10 treatment and of OmpC overproduction are observed in both aerobically- and anaerobically-grown cells, and is accompanied by substantial DNA damage even anaerobically. Thus, only some DNA damage is due to reactive oxygen. We propose that membrane depolarization and the potential reduction in intracellular pH, leading to abasic site formation, cause a substantial amount of the DNA damage associated with both SM10 treatment and endogenous envelope stress. While it is difficult to completely exclude effects related to envelope damage as the sources of DNA damage, trapping intermediates associated with DNA repair and chromosome segregation pathways remains very likely. Thus SM10 may have distinct but synergistic modes of action."
https://openalex.org/W2055085733,"The A(2A)-adenosine receptor undergoes restricted collision coupling with its cognate G protein G(s) and lacks a palmitoylation site at the end of helix 8 in its intracellular C terminus. We explored the hypothesis that there was a causal link between the absence of a palmitoyl moiety and restricted collision coupling by introducing a palmitoylation site. The resulting mutant A(2A)-R309C receptor underwent palmitoylation as verified by both mass spectrometry and metabolic labeling. In contrast to the wild type A(2A) receptor, the concentration-response curve for agonist-induced cAMP accumulation was shifted to the left with increasing expression levels of A(2A)-R309C receptor, an observation consistent with collision coupling. Single particle tracking of quantum dot-labeled receptors confirmed that wild type and mutant A(2A) receptor differed in diffusivity and diffusion mode; agonist activation resulted in a decline in mean square displacement of both receptors, but the drop was substantially more pronounced for the wild type receptor. In addition, in the agonist-bound state, the wild type receptor was frequently subject to confinement events (estimated radius 110 nm). These were rarely seen with the palmitoylated A(2A)-R309C receptor, the preferred diffusion mode of which was a random walk in both the basal and the agonist-activated state. Taken together, the observations link restricted collision coupling to diffusion limits imposed by the absence of a palmitoyl moiety in the C terminus of the A(2A) receptor. The experiments allowed for visualizing local confinement of an agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptor in an area consistent with the dimensions of a lipid raft."
https://openalex.org/W1967431068,"We demonstrate the feasibility of using qPCR on DNA extracted from vaginal Gram stain slides to estimate the presence and relative abundance of specific bacterial pathogens. We first tested Gram stained slides spiked with a mix of 10(8) cfu/ml of Escherichia coli and 10(5) cfu/ml of Lactobacillus acidophilus. Primers were designed for amplification of total and species-specific bacterial DNA based on 16S ribosomal gene regions. Sample DNA was pre-amplified with nearly full length 16S rDNA ribosomal gene fragment, followed by quantitative PCR with genera and species-specific 16S rDNA primers. Pre-amplification PCR increased the bacterial amounts; relative proportions of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus recovered from spiked slides remained unchanged. We applied this method to forty two archived Gram stained slides available from a clinical trial of cerclage in pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. We found a high correlation between Nugent scores based on bacterial morphology of Lactobacillus, Gardenerella and Mobiluncus and amounts of quantitative PCR estimated genus specific DNA (rrn copies) from Gram stained slides. Testing of a convenience sample of eight paired vaginal swabs and Gram stains freshly collected from healthy women found similar qPCR generated estimates of Lactobacillus proportions from Gram stained slides and vaginal swabs. Archived Gram stained slides collected from large scale epidemiologic and clinical studies represent a valuable, untapped resource for research on the composition of bacterial communities that colonize human mucosal surfaces."

Impaired trafficking and homing of HIV Nef-expressing lymphocytes probably contributes to early immune dysfunction following HIV infection. The recirculation of naive and memory lymphocytes, the trafficking of lymphocytes into lymphoid organs, and the appropriate localization of effector cells depend upon a regulated configuration of cell surface adhesion molecules and chemoattractants. Ligand-occupied chemoattractant receptors, trigger Gα subunits of the heterotrimeric G-protein Gi to exchange GTP for GDP. This leads to the release of Gαi-associated Gβγ subunits, activation of downstream effectors, and directed cell migration (1.Rossi D. Zlotnik A. The biology of chemokines and their receptors.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). T lymphocytes employ several different chemokine receptors. The chemokine receptors CCR7, CCR9, and CXCR4 (chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4) along with their cognate ligands regulate T-cell ontogeny in the thymus (2.Wurbel M.A. The chemokine TECK is expressed by thymic and intestinal epithelial cells and attracts double- and single-positive thymocytes expressing the TECK receptor CCR9.Eur.

During an adaptive immune response, activated paracortical T cells use CCR7 and CXCR5 to migrate to the follicle edge and eventually into the lymph node follicle, where they help coordinate B lymphocyte responses (11.Delon J.

Impaired signaling through these different receptors can cause immune dysfunction and lymphoid tissue disorganization. A hallmark of HIV infection is severe disruption of the cellular microenvironment of lymph nodes and the gastrointestinal associated lymphoid tissue. Although this occurs in part as a consequence of CD4+ T cell depletion, a major contributing factor is compromised chemoattractant receptor signaling (13.Pantaleo G. Fauci A.S.

Several mechanisms have been found by which Nef can interfere with chemoattractant receptor signaling. First, HIV and SIV Nef proteins have been shown to down-regulate chemokine receptor expression, presumably through enhanced receptor endocytosis (19.Hrecka K. Swigut T. Schindler M. Kirchhoff F. Skowronski J. Nef proteins from diverse groups of primate lentiviruses downmodulate CXCR4 to inhibit migration to the chemokine stromal derived factor 1.J.

The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus is a broad-spectrum modulator of chemokine receptor cell surface levels that acts independently of classical motifs for receptor endocytosis and Galphai signaling.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3578-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This has been associated with a marked chemotactic arrest, presumably due to loss of the cognate receptor (19.Hrecka K. Swigut T. Schindler M. Kirchhoff F. Skowronski J. Nef proteins from diverse groups of primate lentiviruses downmodulate CXCR4 to inhibit migration to the chemokine stromal derived factor 1.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10650-10659Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Second, Nef can interfere with signal transduction pathways downstream of the receptors by affecting different intracellular signaling proteins involved in these pathways. These include the Ser/Thr kinase PAK; small GTPases, such as Rac and CDC42; and guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as Vav and DOCK2-ELMO1 (21.Roeth J.F. Collins K.L.

HIV-1 Nef binds the DOCK2-ELMO1 complex to activate Rac and inhibit lymphocyte chemotaxis.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In particular, Nef inhibited T lymphocyte chemotaxis toward CXCL12 (chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 12) by disrupting spatially organized cytoskeleton rearrangements through unregulated DOCK2-ELMO1-mediated Rac activation (24.Janardhan A.

Third, Nef has been linked to decreases in integrin expression, which impaired transmigration across endothelial cells (25.Park I.W. He J.J.

With the exception of the studies implicating reduced receptor expression, the majority of these studies indicate that the prominent effect of Nef on chemokine and chemoattractant receptor signaling is downstream of the major signal transducer, the heterotrimeric G-protein Gi. Although Nef undoubtedly targets multiple sites in the chemoattractant signaling pathway, we have discovered a dominant effect of Nef because its expression results in a marked loss of steady-state levels of Gαi2 protein but not of other Gα or Gβγ subunits. Nef triggered AIP4 (atrophin-interacting protein 4) E3 ligase-mediated Gαi2 ubiquitination, leading to its endolysosomal sequestration and destruction. The consequence of the loss of Gαi2 is a marked impairment in chemoattractant receptor signaling and directed leukocyte migration.

Dynasore and epoxomicin treatments were used at 80 and 25 μm concentrations, respectively, for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by staining for flow cytometry or immunoblotting. For this study, HeLa cells were used for microscopy, and T cell lines of Jurkat or CEM cells were used for phenotypic assays. HeLa cell transfection conditions have been described in detail before (69.Shi G. Partida-Sánchez S. Misra R.S. Tighe M. Borchers M.T. Lee J.J. Simon M.I. Lund F.E.

The Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health provided elutriated monocytes and leukocyte-enriched buffy coat from anonymous volunteers. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were purified as before (69.Shi G. Partida-Sánchez S. Misra R.S. Tighe M. Borchers M.T. Lee J.J. Simon M.I. Lund F.E.

Primary hematopoietic cells and cell lines in suspension (7–10 × 106 cells/100 μl) were nucleofected with 3–5 μg of DNA using an Amaxa Nucleofector as recommended by the manufacturer. In all cases, GFP or CD8 expression plasmid was included to check transfection efficiency as described (31.Yi L. Rosales T. Rose J.J. Chaudhury B. Knutson J.R. Venkatesan S. HIV-1 Nef binds a subpopulation of MHC-I throughout its trafficking itinerary and down-regulates MHC-I by perturbing both anterograde and retrograde trafficking.J. Biol.

Cell viability was checked using a FACS-based live/killed assay kit using a Guava Easycyte flow cytometer as described by the manufacturer (Millipore Corp.). Experiments were rejected if cell viability was less than 75%. For biochemical experiments, cell numbers were adjusted to equivalent viability and transfection efficiency. However, for most non-FACS-based experiments, transfectants were purified by positive selection using CD8 immunoaffinity beads from Stem Cell Technologies as recommended by the manufacturer. For single-cycle HIV infection, recombinant viruses expressing mouse CD24 in place of vpR (CD24), CD24 with a vpU deletion (CD24U), or CD24 lacking both vpU and Nef (CD24UM1T) were generated by 293-T cell transfection (Trans-IT LT1 transfection reagent, Mirus Corp.) with the respective HIV proviruses and a VSV-G expression plasmid. Infection was allowed to proceed for 48–72 h to achieve >40% infection. Virus production, quantification, and T cell infection kinetics have been described before (33.Venkatesan S. Petrovic A.

Alternatively, intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured using a FLIPR 3 calcium assay kit (Molecular Devices) with a FlexStation III scanning fluorimeter as described (38.Rose J.J. Foley J.F. Yi L. Herren G. Venkatesan S. Cholesterol is obligatory for polarization and chemotaxis but not for endocytosis and associated signaling from chemoattractant receptors in human neutrophils.J. Biomed. Sci. 2008; 15: 441-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), using Softmax Pro (Molecular Devices) for data acquisition and analysis. Single cell analysis of calcium flux was performed using the Leica SP5, using a ×40 oil immersion objective, numerical aperture 1.25. HeLa cells in 8-well chambers (LabTek chambers, Thermo Scientific) were cotransfected with CerFP or Nef-CerFP and YFP-tagged WT Gαi2 or Gαi3. At 18–24 h post-transfection, cells were loaded with Hanks' balanced saline solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Invitrogen) with 1% FBS and 4 μm Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen). The cells were irradiated with a UV laser at 405 nm for Cerulean and with an argon laser at 488 nm for Fluo-4 and at 514 nm for YFP. Images were acquired in a 512 × 400-pixel format with the pinhole set at 2 airy units every 1–1.4 s for ∼200 s. The images were collected as line scan images, which provide the values of the calcium-dependent increase in fluorescence along a single spatial dimension as a function of time. For analysis, the regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the cells expressing Cerulean/Nef Cerulean. At least 10 ROIs were drawn for each field, and the calcium flux was measured in >5 fields for each experimental condition. The change in the intensities was analyzed using the Leica software, followed by graphing using EXCEL. GST pull-downs of cellular extracts (107 cell equivalents in 1 ml) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 (lysis buffer) with protease inhibitors (1 Complete tablet/ml; Roche Applied Science) was done using purified GST or the indicated GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione- agarose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using antibodies against the respective targets. His6-tagged Nef protein was affinity-selected from extracts of corresponding transfectants using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen Corp.), and FLAG-tagged proteins were selected using agarose bead immobilized M2 mAb (Sigma-Aldrich). Intracellular cAMP levels were assayed using the Direct cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Assay Designs), following the manufacturer's instructions. The optical density was read at 405 nm in a FlexStation II microplate scanner, and the results were analyzed using Softmax Pro 5 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies for CD4, CD8, and the chemokine receptors were obtained from BD Biosciences, R&D Systems, or eBioscience. One million cells were incubated with the appropriate antibodies in 100 μl of PBS containing 1% goat serum for 15 min at room temperature. The data acquisition was carried out using a FACSortTM (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer, and the analyses were done using FlowJo version 9.2. (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR).

Chem. 2004; 279: 24372-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using a Leica TCS-NT/SP5 microscope (Leica, Exton, PA) equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective, numerical aperture 1.32. Images were collected using digital zooms up to ×8. Co-localization experiments were done with live (fluorescent proteins) or fixed cells for most experiments as described (31.Yi L. Rosales T. Rose J.J. Chaudhury B. Knutson J.R. Venkatesan S. HIV-1 Nef binds a subpopulation of MHC-I throughout its trafficking itinerary and down-regulates MHC-I by perturbing both anterograde and retrograde trafficking.J. Biol.

The fluorochromes were excited using a UV laser at 405 nm for Cerulean, an argon laser at 488 nm for Alexa 488 and YFP, and a DPSS laser at 561 nm for Alexa 568 and 647. Images were processed using the Leica TCS-NT/SP5 software, Leica Lite, and Adobe Photoshop CS4. FRET interactions between Nef-CerFP and YFP-tagged Gαi2 or Gαi3 were evaluated using the Leica acceptor photobleaching software to examine in live or fixed cells in the Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a ×60, numerical aperture 1.4 oil immersion objective in a 512 × 512-pixel format using a DPSS laser at 442 nm for Cerulean and an argon laser at 514 nm for YFP. The exposure times were kept equal within each series of images and chosen such that all pixel intensities were within the linear range. A ×63 oil lens was used unless mentioned otherwise. ROIs were selected from individual fields visualized at zoom factors between 1 and 8 (Z1–Z8), and 50–80% YFP photobleaching was achieved in the selected ROIs using the 514-nm laser at 100% power for 45 s at ×8 optical zoom. Each pixel of the image contains data corresponding to an emission spectrum resulting from both CFP and YFP. The fluorescence intensities o"

Plasma Nt-proBNP (Elecsys, Roche) was measured from blood samples taken on admission. The median (IQR) Nt-proBNP level was 681(159-2432) pmol/L. Patients with the highest quartile of Nt-proBNP were older, with higher rate of risk factors and lower ejection fraction. The highest Nt-proBNP quartile group had the lowest SDNN, LF/HF and total power but similar pNN50 and rMSSD levels. Nt-proBNP levels correlated negatively with SDNN (r = -0.19, p<0.001), LF/HF (r = -0.37, p<0.001), and LF (r = -0.29, p<0.001) but not HF (r = -0.043, p = 0.172). Multiple regression analysis showed that plasma propeptide levels remained predictive of LF/HF (B(SE) = -0.065(0.015), p<0.001)), even after adjustment for confounders.In conclusion, our population-based study highlights the importance of Nt-proBNP levels to predict decreased HRV after acute MI."
https://openalex.org/W2089510233,"Large polytopic membrane proteins often derive from duplication and fusion of genes for smaller proteins. The reverse process, splitting of a membrane protein by gene fission, is rare and has been studied mainly with artificially split proteins. Fragments of a split membrane protein may associate and reconstitute the function of the larger protein. Most examples of naturally split membrane proteins are from bacteria or eukaryotic organelles, and their exact history is usually poorly understood. Here, we describe a nuclear-encoded split membrane protein, split-Doa10, in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. In most species, Doa10 is encoded as a single polypeptide with 12–16 transmembrane helices (TMs), but split-KlDoa10 is encoded as two fragments, with the split occurring between TM2 and TM3. The two fragments assemble into an active ubiquitin-protein ligase. The K. lactis DOA10 locus has two ORFs separated by a 508-bp intervening sequence (IVS). A promoter within the IVS drives expression of the C-terminal KlDoa10 fragment. At least four additional Kluyveromyces species contain an IVS in the DOA10 locus, in contrast to even closely related genera, allowing dating of the fission event to the base of the genus. The upstream Kluyveromyces Doa10 fragment with its N-terminal RING-CH and two TMs resembles many metazoan MARCH (Membrane-Associated RING-CH) and related viral RING-CH proteins, suggesting that gene splitting may have contributed to MARCH enzyme diversification. Split-Doa10 is the first unequivocal case of a split membrane protein where fission occurred in a nuclear-encoded gene. Such a split may allow divergent functions for the individual protein segments."
