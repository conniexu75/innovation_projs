https://openalex.org/W1555829980,"Cytochrome b5 reductase from calf liver has been purified by a nonhydrolytic procedure which involves Triton X-100 extraction of microsomes and DEAE-chromatography in the presence of Triton X-100 and deoxycholate. The reductase obtained in this manner has a monomeric molecular weight of 43,000 as compared to a molecular weight of 33,000 for reductase obtained by lysosomal extraction of microsomes. The additional mass present in the new preparation is due to an additional 99 amino acid residues, about 65% of which are hydrophobic and most of which occur in a single amino acid sequence. This hydrophobic amino acid sequence confers upon the reductase a marked tendency to polymerize in aqueous media and permits it to bind to microsomal membranes. The detergent-extracted reductase is catalytically similar to lysosomal-extracted reductase with ferricyanide as an electron acceptor, but its reaction with cytochrome b5 is slowed by polymerization. Chymotryptic cleavage of detergent-extracted reductase releases a core enzyme, which is chromatographically indistinguishable from lysosomal-extracted reductase, and polymers of hydrophobic peptides, the largest of which has a monomeric molecular weight of about 10,000. This is similar to our earlier studies with detergent-extracted cytochrome b5 and constitutes the second example of a membrane protein which has a distinctly amphipathic structure."
https://openalex.org/W1554038443,"Abstract A protein activator for cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase has been purified from bovine heart by a simple procedure which involves ammonium sulfate and acid precipitations, heat treatment, DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. The purified activator appears to be homogeneous by ultracentrifugal and disc gel electrophoretic criteria. The specific activity of the pure activator is approximately 8,000-fold that of the crude tissue extract. For optimal recovery of the activator, the buffer solutions used during purification should contain 1 mm Mg2+. The activator is relatively stable in low concentrations of Mg2+, 1 mm or lower. At higher concentrations of this metal ion, 10 mm or higher, the activator rapidly loses its activity during storage at 4°. The activator is also inactivated by low concentrations of EDTA. This inactivation is not reversed by the addition of Mg2+. Kinetic studies indicate that the activator activates cAMP phosphodiesterase by enhancing the Vmax and decreasing the Km for cAMP. The cyclic nucleotide, in turn, enhances the affinity of the enzyme toward the activator. The dependence of the enzyme activity on the protein concentration of a mixture of the enzyme and the activator is nonlinear, showing upward curvature. These results suggest that the activator and the enzyme may exist in equilibrium among their respective free forms and the active protein complex and that this equilibrium may be modulated by cAMP. The molecular weight of the activator has been determined by sedimentation-diffusion and gel filtration techniques to be 19,200 and 27,000, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1553938468,"Cytochrome aa3 was purified 35- to 40-fold from submitochondrial particles of commercial bakers' yeast. The purification procedure involved solubilization of the enzyme with cholate, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in the presence of Triton X-100. The purified, active enzyme contained approximately 10 nmoles of heme a per mg of protein and was free of other hemoproteins. Upon sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of Triton X-100, it sedimented as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of 190,000 to 225,000. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate resolved the enzyme into six major polypeptide bands of apparent molecular weight 42,000, 34,500, 23,000, 14,000, 12,500, and 9,500. The six components could be specifically precipitated from a crude mitochondrial extract with rabbit antiserum against the holoenzyme. The six components behaved as a single species during DEAE-cellulose chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation, and all could be precipitated with an antiserum against the three small components only. These and other observations indicate that all six components are physically associated with cytochrome c oxidase, even after solubilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1666576753,"Abstract A cyclic AMP (adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate)-dependent protein kinase has been found in membranes derived from human erythrocytes which accounts for greater than 70% of the total cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity of these cells. Components of the erythrocyte membranes were phosphorylated by membrane-bound protein kinase, but stimulation of the rate of phosphorylation by cyclic AMP was observed only when histones or protamine served as substrates. The membrane-associated cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase resembles many soluble protein kinases; it requires 20 mm Mg2+ for maximal activity, has apparent Km values of 26 µg per ml and 8.3 µm for protamine and ATP, respectively, and a Ka for cyclic AMP of 28 nm. Erythrocyte membranes specifically bind cyclic AMP and exhibit a dissociation constant of 3.3 nm for the membrane-cyclic AMP complex. Cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity was dissociated from the membrane by treatment with 1 m NH4Cl, but the cyclic AMP-binding activity was retained by the particulate fraction. These findings suggest that the cyclic AMP-binding moiety is firmly integrated into the membrane structure, whereas the catalytic moiety may only be loosely associated with the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1575093118,"Abstract Rat liver contains at least three active cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase fractions which differ in their substrate affinity, specificity, and subcellular distribution. These forms have been separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Fraction I hydrolyzes cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP), and this activity is unaffected by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This enzyme shows linear kinetics with a high affinity for cyclic GMP. Fraction II hydrolyzes both cyclic nucleotides with relatively low substrate affinities similar to those observed kinetically in the original homogenate. Each cyclic nucleotide acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of the other nucleotide. However, cyclic GMP at low concentrations (1 µm) is an activator of cyclic AMP hydrolysis. Cooperativity is seen in the hydrolysis of both nucleotides by Fraction II at pH 7.4 but not at pH 8.0. Fraction III is a high affinity negatively cooperative cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase which is inhibited by cyclic GMP in a hyperbolic fashion. This activity is associated with 100,000 x g particles, while Fractions I and II are soluble."
https://openalex.org/W1541569010,"Purified cytochrome c oxidase from bakers' yeast can be resolved into six polypeptide bands by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The apparent molecular weights of these components are I, 42,000; II, 34,500; III, 23,000; IV, 14,000; V, 12,500; and VI, 9,500. (Although Component V actually consists of two distinct polypeptide species, it will be regarded as homogeneous in this study.) In order to study the biosynthesis of these components, yeast cells were labeled with [3H]leucine in the presence of specific inhibitors of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein synthesis. Labeled cytochrome c oxidase components were then isolated from crude mitochondrial extracts by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeling of the three large Components I, II, and III was insensitive to cycloheximide and sensitive to erythromycin. Labeling of the two largest Components I and II was dependent on the presence of oxygen. The three small Components IV, V, and VI were not labeled in the presence of cycloheximide but became labeled in the presence of erythromycin. These results show that our cytochrome c oxidase preparation contains three polypeptides which are translated on mitochondrial ribosomes and three polypeptides which are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Two of the mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides are only made in the presence of oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1494609681,"Abstract An affinity column procedure was devised for the purification of protocollagen proline hydroxylase, the enzyme which synthesizes the hydroxyproline in collagen by hydroxylating peptidyl proline. The procedure involved linking a peptide substrate with a high affinity for the enzyme to agarose and then specifically eluting the enzyme from the agarose with a high concentration of a second peptide substrate of lower affinity. The second substrate was then separated from the enzyme by gel filtration. The isolated enzyme was homogeneous by gel filtration, by ultracentrifugation of the enzyme in the native and dissociated state, and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the native and dissociated state. Also, the enzyme had a considerably higher specific activity than enzyme isolated from the same source with other procedures. The enzyme was shown to be a tetramer which has a molecular weight of about 230,000 and is composed of two different types of subunits. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the molecular weights of the two types of subunits were 60,000 and 64,000. Ultracentrifugation of the enzyme in guanidine hydrochloride and mercaptoethanol indicated that the molecular weight for the 2 subunits was 62,000. The enzyme was dissociated into both monomers and dimers by either dithiothreitol or mercaptoethanol, indicating that the structural integrity of the enzyme is maintained in part by either intrachain or interchain disulfide bonds. The monomers had no enzymatic activity. The isolated enzyme was shown to have no protocollagen lysine hydroxylase activity. All of the hydroxyproline synthesized by the enzyme was shown to be 4-hydroxyproline, and no 3-hydroxyproline activity was detected."
https://openalex.org/W2064224049,"Glucose-induced release of insulin from perifused rat islets is associated with elevated islet adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. If values for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate are compared to insulin release during theophylline or glucose stimulation and theophylline plus glucose stimulation, it suggests a minor role for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in directly stimulating insulin release but a prominent role in modulating glucose-induced release of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1496129614,"Abstract The titrations of the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase or the catalytic subunit derived therefrom by a heat-stable protein inhibitor are quantitatively identical. Evidence is presented that the inhibitor does not interact with adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase in the absence of the cyclic nucleotide. There is no displacement of the regulatory subunit from the holoenzyme nor is there formation of a stable inhibitor-holoenzyme complex. The interaction of inhibitor and catalytic subunit is shown to be reversible by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and by dilution. The results demonstrate that the inhibitor interacts with adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase only after cyclic nucleotide-promoted dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1981010277,"A specific immunofluorescent histochemical method for cyclic adenosine monophosphate was used to study rat cerebellum. After topical treatment with norepinephrine or stimulation of norepinephrine-containing afferents from locus coeruleus, there was a striking increase in the number of Purkinje cells with strong cyclic adenosine monophosphate reactivity. Other putative inhibitory transmitters had no significant effect on staining of Purkinje cells. The results provide the first histochemical support for the hypothesis that cyclic adenosine monophosphate can be generated postsynaptically in central neurons in response to noradrenergic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1568722752,"Abstract Cattle retinal outer segments bind the γ-terminal phosphate residue from [γ-32P]ATP when incubated in the presence of Mg++ ion. The binding involves visual pigment molecules since, following labeling of the visual pigments with 11-cis-[3H]retinaldehyde and reduction on site with sodium borohydride, both the tritium and 32P peaks occur in identical protein bands when the outer segments are dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), reduced and disaggregated by dialysis against β-mercaptoethanol, and electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. Phosphorylation of visual pigments is slightly inhibited by Ca++ but is unaffected by Na+, K+, or adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. It is unrelated to Na,K-ATPase activity present in these preparations. The phosphorylation is increased by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 by incubation in continuous white light over incubation in darkness; under continuous illumination up to 0.5 to 0.6 mole of Pi per mole of rhodopsin is incorporated. Phosphorylation is maximal after 10 min at 37° and decreases thereafter. Its extent is proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached. The phosphorylation reaction does not appear to have greater specificity for rhodopsin than for other proteins present as minor components in retinal outer segment preparations; however, of a variety of soluble proteins added to the incubation mixture in high concentrations along with outer segment membranes, only calf thymus histone is capable of binding 32P from [γ-32P]ATP. Of possible mechanisms for the light-stimulated phosphorylation, the release of free retinaldehyde, which may activate a kinase or sensitize binding sites, and a light-stimulated Ca++ binding, which could free the Mg++-stimulated phosphorylation from inhibition, have been eliminated experimentally. Visual pigment protein appears capable of binding a single phosphate residue at any step of its bleaching cycle as well as in the dark-adapted state, but the intermediate with the greatest affinity for the γ-phosphate of ATP may be pararhodopsin. The physiological significance of the light-stimulated phosphorylation reaction is uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1508502689,"Abstract The (Na+ + K+)-ATPase from Electrophorus electroplax was shown to require phospholipids. Treatment of the enzyme with phospholipase A from Naja naja venom removed almost all phosphatides with concomitant loss of enzymatic activity and of the ability to form phosphoryl enzyme. On the other hand digestion with phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens removed nearly all of the lecithin, two-thirds of the phosphatidylethanolamine, and none of the phosphatidylserine. ATPase activity was partly inhibited by phospholipase C whereas the steady state level of the phosphoryl enzyme and the rate of the Na+-dependent nucleotide transphosphorylation were not impaired. Phospholipase C treatment produced an increased proportion of the E2 conformation at a given level of Mg++; inhibition of the ATPase and p-nitrophenylphosphatase by high Mg++ were more pronounced with the phospholipase C-treated enzyme. The reduced turnover of the phospholipase C-treated ATPase probably arises from this same effect. It was concluded that phosphatidylserine is a requirement for the formation of phosphoryl enzyme as well as its dephosphorylation, and phosphatidylethanolamine acts as a modifier which influences the affinity of the enzyme for Mg++."
https://openalex.org/W1529982624,"Abstract Interactions between the lipid bilayer and the hydrophobic portions of cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase have been found to be essential for, and, in fact, to control the over-all rate of reduction of cytochrome b5 by NADH in hepatic microsomes. The present data and earlier work from this laboratory show that the reoxidation of reduced cytochrome b5 reductase by cytochrome b5 is the rate-limiting step in the reduction of microsomal cytochrome b5. Removal of phospholipid markedly decreases the rate of cytochrome b5 reduction and reconstitution with liposomes completely restores the structural and functional characteristics of the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase electron transport pathway. These findings, along with the observation of a similar effect of liposomes on the NADH-dependent reduction of purified cytochrome b5 by the purified reductase, indicate that the amphipathic nature of these proteins is responsible for the lipid dependence of this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1578589180,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulates in guinea pig cerebral cortical slices during incubations with histamine, histamine-norepinephrine, adenosine, adenosine-histamine, adenosine-norepinephrine, adenosine-histamine-norepinephrine, veratridine, and veratridine-histamine. The rate of increase of cyclic AMP levels in response to various agents appears to be limited to some extent by the rate of diffusion of small molecules into the extracellular space of the slices. The diffusion of [3H]sorbitol occurred with a t½ of l3 min. Increases in total levels of cyclic AMP and increases in levels of radioactive cyclic AMP derived from intracellular adenine nucleotides, labeled by a prior incubation with radioactive adenine, occurred on similar time courses and to similar extents. Radioactive cyclic AMP represents a small but relatively constant fraction (7 to 13%) of the total amount of cyclic AMP. During stimulation with histamine, however, the initial accumulation of radioactive cyclic AMP represents a significantly smaller fraction of the total amount of cyclic AMP. Except in this instance, the data provide no evidence for the presence of more than one major compartment of adenine nucleotides in brain slices that can serve as a source of nucleotide precursor for cyclic AMP. The nucleotides of this compartment or compartments appear to be uniformly labeled by incubation with radioactive adenine and to represent about 30% of the total adenine nucleotides of the slice. Conversion of radioactive adenine to cyclic AMP is proportional to the steady state levels of the cyclic nucleotide and occurs at rates of up to 10 pmoles per mg of protein per min in the continued presence of stimulatory agents."
https://openalex.org/W1483665903,"Abstract Three protein kinases were separated from bovine epididymal spermatozoa by using DEAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. The molecular weights of these three kinases were estimated to be 120,000, 78,000 and 56,000 by the use of Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. The activity of all three kinases was greatly enhanced by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). In the presence of 10-6 m cyclic AMP, a catalytic subunit of molecular weight 30,000 to 35,000 was separated from each of the three protein kinases. Under these same conditions, cyclic AMP-binding proteins were located in fractions corresponding to molecular weights of 78,000, 35,000 to 40,000, and 17,000 to 18,000; the latter may result from proteolysis for it was not observed in fresh preparations. The cyclic AMP-binding protein of molecular weight 78,000 combined with the isolated catalytic subunits of all three protein kinases. The apparent Km for casein (approximately 3 mg per ml) appeared to be neither different for the three kinases nor affected by the addition of cyclic AMP. The apparent Km for ATP varied from 3.5 to 8.7 µm, but it appeared to be the same for all three protein kinases and also appeared to be unaffected by cyclic AMP. The isolated catalytic subunit of the kinase of molecular weight 120,000 exhibited a Km for ATP of 5.5 µm, which agreed with the Km for the intact kinase. Maximum kinase activity was at about pH 6.5 with casein as substrate and at about pH 7.5 with histone as substrate for all three kinases. The isolated catalytic subunit of the 120,000 molecular weight kinase showed identical responses to pH. Cyclic AMP activated all three kinases half-maximally in the 10-7 m range, whereas cyclic GMP activated the kinases half-maximally in the 10-6 m range. 8-Methylthio-cyclic AMP appeared to be more potent than cyclic AMP in activating the kinases. The data suggest that the catalytic subunits of the three kinases are either similar or identical."
https://openalex.org/W2104961626,"Abstract Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase participates in the biosynthesis in bacteria of purine nucleotides, pyrimidine nucleotides, tryptophan, histidine, and the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes. A kinetic study of the interaction of highly purified PRPP synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium with end products and other potential metabolite effectors has been conducted. There is no evidence for cooperative homotropic substrate interactions in the presence or absence of inhibitors. ADP, which is a much more effective inhibitor as a function of concentration than any other nucleotide, displays a complex inhibition pattern. A detailed steady state kinetic analysis of ADP inhibition is consistent with competition at the ATP site and formation of a dead-end E(ADP) (PRPP) complex, when subsaturating concentrations of ribose-5-P are used or when the reverse reaction is studied. However, ADP also alters PRPP synthetase in such a fashion as to bring about pronounced substrate inhibition by ribose-5-P. This inhibition is not purely the result of formation of a E(ADP) (ribose-5-P) complex, but appears to be the consequence of binding of ADP and possibly ribose 5-P at sites that are distinct from the substrate sites. Other nucleotide inhibitors do not bring about substrate inhibition. Low concentrations of Ca2+ ions bring about substrate inhibition in the absence of ADP and partially desensitize PRPP synthetase to the effect of ADP. Purine nucleotides are much more effective inhibitors than pyrimidine nucleotides; both are purely competitive with ATP. Kinetic analysis of inhibition by pairs of nucleotide inhibitors (except ADP) indicates that, although these inhibitors are competitive with ATP, they exert synergistic effects on the action of each other and do not bind in a mutually exclusive fashion. Histidine and tryptophan do not inhibit purified PRPP synthetase under any conditions examined. Deoxynucleotides, pyridine nucleotides, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, 2'- or 3'-pyrophosphoryl guanosine 5'-diphosphate, and intermediates of glycolysis and the pentose cycle are either very weak inhibitors or without effect on PRPP synthetase activity. Although the physiological significance of the various kinetic effects cannot be established by these studies alone, the findings are consistent with the proposals that (a) PRPP synthetase is subject to regulation by the ATP/ADP ratio and hence the supply of metabolic energy, (b) the sensitivity to ATP/ADP ratio is modified by the concentrations of ribose-5-P in the cell, and (c) the enzyme may be controlled by the total pool of nucleotide end products, particularly purine nucleotides. The observation that PRPP synthetase is subject to specific repressive control by pyrimidines (White, M. N., Olszowy, J., and Switzer, R. L. (1971) J. Bacteriol. 108, 122) suggests that PRPP synthesis may be controlled in bacteria by regulatory complementation between feedback inhibition by purine nucleotides and repression by pyrimidine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1558385973,"Abstract A mutant of Escherichia coli unable to metabolize succinate has been used to study the nature of succinate transport in whole cells. It is demonstrated that cells accumulate succinate against a concentration gradient. The uptake of succinate is competitively inhibited by fumarate and malate. The Michaelis constants for the dicarboxylic acids are all in the range of 15 to 30 µm. The accumulation of succinate is prevented by various energy poisons and sulfhydryl reagents. Inhibitors of mitochondrial dicarboxylate transport are without any effect on the succinate uptake system of E. coli. The influx and efflux of succinate in whole cells is temperature dependent. The influx increases rapidly between 15 and 36° and efflux between 36–50°. The transport system is induced by succinate and repressed by glucose. Mutants lacking adenyl cyclase and some lacking enzyme I of phosphotransferase system acquire succinate transport activity when grown in the presence of succinate and cyclic 3',5'-AMP. Mutants of E. coli unable to transport succinate fall into two broad categories which are referred to as dct (dicarboxylate transport) and ct (carboxylate transport). The dct mutants fail to grow on dicarboxylic acids (fumarate, malate, and succinate) but grow normally on the monocarboxylic acid, lactate. The ct mutants do not grow on either the dicarboxylic acids or on lactate. Both classes of mutants grow well on acetate. The dct class of mutants can be genotypically separated into two categories. The dct A mutants map at around 69 min, and the dct B mutant maps at about 17 min (linked to galactose locus) on the genetic map. The ct mutants are also linked to galactose. It is inferred from these experiments that there are at least two components involved in the transport of succinate in E. coli. It is suggested that the ct gene possibly specifies a carboxylate binding protein. This suggestion is based on the evidence that osmotically shocked cells of E.coli lose the capacity for uptake of succinate."
https://openalex.org/W1591083229,"Abstract The antidiuretic hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase system has been characterized in a purified preparation of porcine renal plasma membranes. Adenylate cyclase activity was linear over a plasma membrane protein concentration from 30 to 300 µg, and maximal enzyme activity occurred at approximately 7 x 10-4 m ATP. Activation of the system by sodium fluoride was about 10-fold and was produced by 10 to 12 mm sodium fluoride. The adenylate cyclase was stimulated approximately 3-fold by the antidiuretic hormone. One-half maximal stimulation by hormone was measured at 2.2 x 10-8 m antidiuretic hormone. Calcium exhibited an inhibitory effect upon antidiuretic hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase at concentrations of the metal ion above 10-6 m, but it produced little or no inhibition in the sodium fluoride-stimulated system. The chelating agent, ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'tetraacetic acid, at a concentration of 1 mm, completely inhibited antidiuretic hormone-stimulated adenyl cyclase. The activity of the chelator-inhibited enzyme was completely restored by increasing concentrations of calcium. Binding of tritiated antidiuretic hormone to the renal plasma membranes was measured by centrifugation techniques and by filtration through Millipore filters. Both methods demonstrated that binding of the hormone to the membranes occurred at a level of approximately 0.5 pmole of antidiuretic hormone per mg of protein when the hormone was added at a concentration that produced half-maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The rates of association and dissociation for the interaction between the antidiuretic hormone and renal plasma membranes were measured. Binding equilibrium was reached after approximately 10 min at 37°. Dissociation of tritiated bound hormone was shown to be 100% complete after approximately 30 min. Graphical analysis of the time course of dissociation demonstrated that the kinetics of the reaction follows a simple first order rate equation. Neither adrenocorticotropic hormone nor calcitonin exchanged with antidiuretic hormone at its binding site, indicating that the receptor sites exhibit a specificity for the antidiuretic hormone. Calcium ion concentrations in the millimolar range inhibited the rate and level of binding of ADH to renal plasma membranes with complete inhibition reached at 10 mm calcium. However, ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid at the same concentration at which it completely inhibited adenylate cyclase activity had no effect upon the binding of antidiuretic hormone to the membranes. These results suggest that calcium plays multiple regulatory roles with millimolar concentrations inhibiting binding to membrane receptor sites and lower calcium concentrations mediating at a locus within the membrane matrix between the receptor site and the site occupied by adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1548336227,"Abstract The kinetics and equilibrium of the electron transfer between isolated cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c and artificial carriers have been studied. The oxidation of ferrocytochrome c1 by ferricyanide showed a rate constant of 3.6 x 104 m-1 s-1 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 23°. Under the same condition the rate constant for the reduction of ferricytochrome c1 by ascorbate was found to be 1.2 m-1 s-1. The second order rate constant of the reduction of ferricytochrome c1 by N,N,N',N', tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine to ferrocytochrome c1 and Wurster's blue was 2 x 104 m-1 s-1 and that of the reverse reaction was 3.9 x 104 m-1 s-1. Wurster's blue could not be further oxidized by either ferricytochrome c1 or ferricytochrome c. The oxidation of ferrocytochrome c1 by ferricytochrome c to ferricytochrome c1 and ferrocytochrome c was not a very fast reaction as generally believed and showed a second order rate constant (k1) of 3.3 x 106 m-1 s-1 at 10° and the reverse reaction showed a rate constant (k-1) of 1.0 x 106 m-1 s-1. These values gave an equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction of 3.3, which was in good agreement with direct spectrophotometric measurements for K. K was independent of the ionic strength and temperature studied, but dependent upon pH. The rate constant, k1, was, however, a function of temperature and ionic strength as well as pH. The reaction rates toward ferricytochrome c were the same whether ferrocytochrome c1 was in the soluble form or structured in a particulate succinate cytochrome c reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1615322207,"Abstract Fructolysis is stimulated 3- to 5-fold in bovine epididymal spermatozoa when the latter are preincubated with caffeine, theophylline, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), and N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate ((Bt)2-cAMP). No increase in fructolysis is observed if phosphodiesterase inhibitors or cyclic nucleotides are added to freshly washed cells or to preincubated cells just before fructolytic assay. The rates of [U-14C]lactate formation from [U-14C]fructose vary considerably when either the length of incubation or the concentration of these compounds is changed. In either case, increased fructolysis results in increased motility, decreased ATP levels, and, in most cases, a decreased energy charge of the adenylate pool. The assay of metabolites either with or without caffeine or (Bt)2cAMP suggests that these compounds stimulate fructolysis at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase. It is concluded that fructolysis in immotile bovine epididymal sperm is inhibited by ATP whereas the induction of motility alters the composition of the adenylate pool and relieves this inhibition. Finally, it is suggested that differences in glycolytic rates in testicular and ejaculated spermatozoa directly reflect ATP content and indirectly the capacity for motility."
https://openalex.org/W1514508191,"Abstract When 1,2-propanediol is added to dioldehydrase-coenzyme B12, electron spin resonance signals appear which indicate the presence of at least two paramagnetic species. One signal, at g = 2.2, is attributed to Co(II) of B12(r). Other signals, at g ≈ 2.0, which show different power saturation behavior, are tentatively assigned to organic radicals, possibly derived from the substrate and the adenosyl moiety of the coenzyme. The occurrence of such species is in accord with a previously proposed mechanism (Finlay, T. H., Valinsky, J., Sato, K., and Abeles, R. H. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 4197–4207). Integration of the signal indicates that approximately 0.75 unpaired electrons are present per molecule of enzyme-coenzyme complex. Signals with similar but not identical g values were obtained with the substrate analogues chloroacetaldehyde and glycolaldehyde. With chloroacetaldehyde the signal at g = 2.0 shows pronounced fine structure and non-uniform saturation behavior, confirming the multiplicity and substrate dependence of this signal. With both substrate analogues nearly two unpaired electrons are detected per molecule of enzyme-coenzyme complex. The paramagnetic species have only a small effect on the longitudinal relaxation rate of the water protons, suggesting that they are shielded from the solvent. The distance of closest approach of the water protons to the paramagnetic center was estimated to be 10.2 A. These experiments established that dioldehydrase can bring about the homolytic cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond of coenzyme B12 and suggest the possibility that radical species may be intermediates in the catalytic reaction. A kinetic analysis will be required to establish conclusively that the radicals play a significant role in the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1604912898,"Abstract A method is described for quantitatively assaying elongation factor 2 (EF-2), the enzyme that catalyses the translocation of polypeptidyl tRNA on eucaryotic ribosomes. Tissue homogenates are centrifuged in the presence of 0.5 m salt, which removes EF-2 from ribosomes, and charcoal, which adsorbs endogenous NAD. The soluble extract is incubated with 0.18 m histamine, activated diphtheria toxin, and [32P]NAD of known specific activity, and the resulting acid-insoluble [32P]ADP-ribosyl EF-2 is counted. The EF-2 content of different tissues is closely correlated with the number of ribosomes with an average ratio of about 1.2 molecules per ribosome. On centrifuging sucrose homogenates of tissues, only the excess of EF-2 over the number of ribosomes remains in the supernatant fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1565409229,"Abstract The mechanism of the uterotrophic and antiuterotrophic action of testosterone in the rat is unknown. Since testosterone does not compete with estradiol-17β for receptor sites, the possible direct interaction of testosterone with uterine components in the rat was investigated. Following the administration of [3H]testosterone to immature female rats, the hormone is selectively taken up by uterine nuclei and is retained for 15 to 30 min. Thereafter, the hormone is gradually released and is virtually eliminated from the uterine nuclei over a period of 2 hours. Very low levels of radioactivity are accumulated in nuclei of diaphragm and other tissues. The simultaneous administration of non-labeled testosterone reduces the nuclear uptake of [3H]testosterone in the uterus by about 80% while it has no effect on the uptake of the labeled hormone by diaphragm nuclei. In the cytosol as well as the nuclear extract of the uterus, [3H]testosterone is bound to macromolecules which are excluded from Sephadex G-50. The nuclear [3H]testosterone macromolecule complex is also excluded from Sephadex G-200. No association of [3H]testosterone to macromolecules in cytosol or nuclei of diaphragm was observed. Uptake and binding of [3H]testosterone to nuclear components were also demonstrated in vitro following incubation of uteri at 37° in Eagle's Hela culture medium. Binding to nuclear components is highly specific for testosterone and the nuclear binding sites are saturated with low concentrations of the hormone. 5α-Dihydrotestosterone is much less effective than testosterone in competing with [3H]testosterone for the nuclear binding sites. Estradiol-17β reduces the nuclear accumulation of [3H]testosterone by only 20 to 30% while progesterone, cortisol, and cyproterone acetate at the concentrations used have no effect. Studies using cell-free systems indicate that binding of testosterone to cytoplasmic components is a prerequisite step for the transfer of the hormone to the nucleus. In vitro and in vivo studies show that the immature rat uterus lacks the capacity to convert testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone or estrogens, to any significant extent. These results demonstrate that the immature rat uterus contains cytoplasmic and nuclear binding components (receptors) with high affinity and specificity for testosterone. Thus the uterotrophic and antiuterotrophic action of testosterone appears to be a direct action of the hormone by a mechanism distinct from that of estradiol-17β. The data also demonstrate that the uterine androgen-binding components are different from those found in the rat prostate with regard to their relative affinity for testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Therefore the intracellular active form of androgen may vary from tissue to tissue. Whereas 5α-dihydrotestosterone appears to be the major active androgen in the rat prostate, in other tissues such as the uterus the predominant active androgen may be testosterone itself."
https://openalex.org/W1520375709,"Phosphofructokinase in rabbit skeletal muscle was assayed before and after intravenous epinephrine administration. Assays at optimal pH (8.2) and in the presence of optimal substrate concentrations showed no significant difference in enzyme activity. Muscle extracts prepared in the presence of caffeine were assayed under conditions optimal for allosteric kinetics (pH 6.9 and low substrate concentrations) and in the presence of cyclic 3′,5′-AMP. These assays showed that enzyme activity in epinephrine extracts was much higher than control activity. Under the following conditions control activity increased and activity in epinephrine extracts was not significantly changed: (a) if muscle extracts were prepared in the presence of fructose-1,6-P2; (b) when the substrate concentrations in the assay mixture were high; (c) when there was not enough coupling enzymes present to remove rapidly fructose-1,6-P2 formed; (d) when muscle extracts were prepared in the absence of caffeine. Studies on the kinetics of the enzyme at pH 6.9 showed that following epinephrine administration phosphofructokinase became less sensitive to ATP inhibition and had a higher affinity to its second substrate, fructose-6-P. Studies on purified phosphofructokinase revealed that enzyme incubated with fructose-6-P, fructose-1,6-P2, cyclic 3′,5′-AMP or 5′-AMP could be modified to a form that was active independent of the presence of cyclic 3′,5′-AMP, and less sensitive to inhibition by ATP and caffeine. We conclude that phosphofructokinase, following epinephrine administration, is converted to a form that is more active under assay conditions that favor enzyme inhibition. Such activation appears to be mediated through a combination of hexose phosphates and adenylate nucleotides that are known to be increased by epinephrine."
https://openalex.org/W1554481951,"Abstract 1. HTC cells in suspension culture actively transport the model amino acid α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by a saturable, energy-dependent process that demonstrates Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 2. Dexamethasone markedly decreases AIB transport, reducing uptake by 75% within 2 hours and by 85% after 18 to 24 hours incubation with the hormone. Dexamethasone has no effect on AIB transport for 30 min, after which initial velocity of transport declines exponentially. The effect is half-maximal in 1 hour. After 2 hours of exposure of cells to dexamethasone, Vmax for AIB transport declines to 25% of the control value, while Km is essentially unchanged. After 18 hours, Vmax declines further to 20% of the control value, and Km increases to three times the control value. Dexamethasone decreases AIB influx into HTC cells and does not increase efflux from the cells. 3. Insulin increases AIB transport only slightly in untreated cells. In contrast, in cells previously incubated with dexamethasone, insulin markedly increases AIB uptake. In cells incubated with dexamethasone for 18 hours and then with insulin for a further 2 hours, AIB transport increases 5-fold to 75% of the control value. The effect of insulin is apparent within 30 min and is maximal in 2 hours; it has declined by 4 hours. After 2 hours of exposure of cells to insulin, Vmax increases nearly 4 times to 70% of the control value, and Km decreases 2 times. 4. Both hormonal effects on AIB transport are dependent on protein synthesis, for cycloheximide added 30 min prior to either hormone completely blocks its effect. Addition of actinomycin D 30 min prior to either hormone partially blocks its effect."
https://openalex.org/W148915840,"Abstract Three distinct serologically phenotypic mucins have been described in the hog submaxillary glands; A+, H+, and A-H- (In). Alkaline borohydride reductive cleavage of A+ and A- pig submaxillary mucin (A+-PSM and A--PSM) has enabled Carlson to propose structures for the oligosaccharides of these mucins. The structures presented readily explained the A+ and H+ cross-reactivity of the mucins, but left the structures of the In mucins unexplained. The relationship of H+ and In mucins and our previously published serological observations prompted us to determine the structures of the oligosaccharides isolated from inactive mucins secreted by hog submaxillary glands. In the present study, six oligosaccharides were isolated representing all of the potential combinations of imcomplete chains. The salient feature of this study is the demonstration of the attachment of sialic acid to galactose as well as to N-acetylgalactosaminitol. The structures of the three isolated acidic oligosaccharides are: a tetrasaccharide (I), α-l-fucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-[N-glycolyl neuraminyl-(2 → 6)]-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactitol; a trisaccharide (II), N-glycolyl neuraminyl-(2 → 6)-d-ga-lactopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactitol; and a disaccharide (III), N-glycolylneuraminyl-(2 → 6)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactitol. Neutral oligosaccharides (IV, V, and VI) are the corresponding desialized materials. The structural features revealed are consonant with the observed serological phenomena and indicate the involvement of two sialyltransferases in the biosynthesis of the mucin. A possible biosynthetic pathway with the relative activity of the different glycosyltransferases is presented and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1673579478,"Abstract The kinetic and equilibrium properties of carbon monoxide binding by seven different examples of cytochrome c' have been investigated. It has been found that the ligand-binding mechanism is complex in all cases, with five equilibria controlling the process. Moreover, the stoichiometry of ligand binding has been found to be at least 2 carbon monoxide molecules per heme. A detailed mathematical model has been derived which describes the ligand-binding process. In agreement with a previous proposal, we find that the heme group is situated in a protein bounded with only hindered access of dissolved ligands to the heme-binding site. Once the ligand enters the cage it has two options: to bind to the heme to form a heme-CO complex with an attendant absorbance change, or to bind to some other site (unspecified) with no associated spectral change. Both the spectral and nonspectral forms can bind a 2nd CO molecule to form the fully liganded complex. In the final form 2 molecules of CO are bound per heme, only 1 eliciting a spectral change."

No incorporation of amino acids into protein was observed if the cells were incubated under nitrogen. Optimal incorporation was obtained in 3 m m to 12 m m phosphate buffer at pH 7.17. The incorporation was inhibited at higher phosphate concentrations, and it was also less efficient in Tris-HCl buffer, Tris-maleate buffer, and Tris-phosphoric acid buffer. The incorporation of l -[1-14C]leucine into protein was directly proportional to the concentration of the cells in the suspension. High doses of l -leucine or l -methionine (∼2 m m ) did not inhibit the incorporation of amino acids into protein. The cells were freely permeable for l -leucine and l -methionine. The system incorporating amino acids into protein was half-saturated with 7.2 x 10-5 m l -leucine and 5.1 x 10-5 m l -methionine. An inhibition of 50% of the incorporation of l -leucine or l -methionine into protein was observed at a puromycin concentration of 1.4 µg per ml, or 0.8 µg per ml, respectively. Changing the incubation temperature from 22° to 32° caused a 4-fold increase of the initial rate of incorporation of l -leucine or l -methionine."

On incubation of the ligase-adenylate complex with pyrophosphate, the radioactive moiety is released as ATP. These data indicate that the complex is a reaction intermediate, and that DNA ligase from mammalian cells acts by the same mechanism as microbial DNA ligases."
https://openalex.org/W1480930313,"Abstract Conalbumin complexes containing one, and only one, specifically bound metal ion were isolated by the isoelectric focusing technique. This made possible the preparation of a series of mixed metal or mixed isotope complexes: GaoFeiconalbumin, FeoGaiconalbumin, 56Fe2conalbumin, 56Feo 57Feiconalbumin, 57Feo 56Feiconalbumin, and 57Fe2conalbumin. The appropriate species were studied by EPR, Mossbauer, and optical spectroscopy. It was possible, in this way, to determine the contribution of each site to the spectrum of the protein. Occupancy of the first (or inner) binding site by Fe(III) produces EPR, Mossbauer, and optical difference spectra which are readily distinguishable from those given by the second (outer) site. Summation spectra obtained from the two sites are the same as those obtained from diferric conalbumin. We conclude, therefore, that the specific binding sites of conalbumin are not identical, and that the protein does not bind metal ions in a simple random fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1503219885,"Abstract Osmotic shock of Escherichia coli results in the release of a protein which specifically binds arginine. Its release is associated with the loss of arginine-specific transport. Other methods were sought for the isolation of the arginine-specific binding protein. The protein was purified by diethylaminoethylcellulose, Sephadex G-100, hydroxylapatite, and isoelectric focusing, which gave a pI of 5.10. The protein has a Kd of 3 x 10-8 m, and binds 1 mole of arginine per mole of protein using a molecular weight of 27,700, as determined by high speed equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Amino acid analyses of the arginine-specific and lysine-arginine-ornithine (LAO)-binding proteins show the presence of 2 half-residues of cystine per molecule of protein. Antiserum prepared against the arginine-specific protein did not react with the LAO-binding protein, nor did antiserum prepared against the LAO protein react with the arginine-specific protein. While arginine has been shown to be an inhibitor of the LAO transport system but not a substrate, two other inhibitors of the LAO system, citrulline and canavanine, were shown to be substrates as well. Attempts at reconstitution of arginine transport in osmotically shocked cells by the addition of purified protein were unsuccessful. A new method for measuring arginine transport was devised, the coupling of transport to decarboxylation, which may be useful in studying reconstitution."
https://openalex.org/W1591241149,"The K+ activation of the p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity of Electrophorus electric organ (Na+-K+)-ATPase is characterized by a synergistic activation by Na+. This phenomenon does not require the presence of nucleotides, and it is markedly enhanced by dimethylsulfoxide. Analysis of the activation data leads to the conclusion that K+ activation in the absence of Na+ involves two different sets of binding sites, one of which regulates substrate accessibility to the phosphatase site and one of which acts to increase its catalytic potential. Na+ can replace K+ in the first instance, but is only 3% as effective as a catalytic activator. Na+ appears to exert its regulatory action through a distinct set of Na+ specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W1674401746,"Abstract Details of a method for the preparation and purification of the heme protein P-450 from bovine adrenal glands are described. This method consists of the isolation of mitochondria, their ultrasonic disruption, followed by lyophilization, and extractions with acetone and 1-butanol in several steps, which remove 60 to 70% of the neutral and phospholipids. The heme protein P-450 is isolated by a fractional extraction with solutions of the neutral detergent Triton N-101, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis. The resulting optically clear preparation can be stored in the frozen state for several months without deterioration. After reconstitution with the specific FAD-containing reductase and the specific iron sulfur protein, both isolated and partially purified from the adrenal cortex, this P-450 preparation is highly active as steroid 11β-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.1.6) with TPNH as electron donor (pH optimum 6.3 to 6.5, turnover number 5 to 10 min-1 at 25°). The heme protein is also active in steroid 11β-hydroxylation with artificial electron donors in the presence of the specific iron sulfur protein. In addition, the reconstituted enzyme system catalyzes the side chain cleavage of cholesterol. The optical absorption spectra of the preparation exhibit Soret maxima at 416, 419, and 448 nm for the Fe3+, the Fe2+ form, and the CO-compound, respectively. The EPR spectrum shows the characteristic features of the low spin (S = ½ form of P-450 (Fe3+), with principal components 1.91, 2.24, and 2.42 of the g-tensor. P-450 accounts for 98% or more, and a P-420 type material for the remaining part of the measured protoheme IX content; these are the only heme proteins detectable. Specific concentration of P-450 in the preparation lies between 1.5 and 2.0 nmoles per mg of protein; the preparation contains also neutral and phospholipids (of the order of 10 to 15%), but negligible amounts of cholesterol (l0.1%). This enzymatically active material is suitable for optical and other spectroscopic studies as well as detailed investigations of the physical characteristics and the chemical nature of the heme protein P-450. A brief comparison is made with the properties of other particulate or solubilized P-450 preparations, obtained by several investigators from liver microsomes and other mammalian sources, and with the soluble P-450cam from Pseudomonas putida."
https://openalex.org/W1565468940,"Abstract The sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was partially purified from a microsomal fraction of whole rabbit brain, homogenized in a deoxycholate buffer. Suspension and separation by flotation of the resulting lipoproteins in a linear gradient of potassium iodide formed the basis of a rapid preparative technique, whereby the enzyme-containing lipoproteins were harvested as a lipoid pellicle, following centrifugation in 1.5 m potassium iodide. After treatment of the resulting preparation with sodium dodecyl sulfate, disc gel electrophoresis revealed seven bands, the most prominent of which had a mobility corresponding to a molecular weight of 98,000. The enzyme protein was labeled in parallel incubations with N-ethyl[14C]maleimide and N-ethyl[3H]maleimide in the absence and presence, respectively, of protecting ligands after which it was solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The initial separation of the resulting sodium dodecyl sulfate-protein complexes by agarose filtration revealed the presence of ligand-protected sulfhydryl groups on a protein of high molecular weight. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-protein complexes were subsequently resolved by preparative disc gel electrophoresis, and the protected sulfhydryl groups were found to be confined to a single component. This component was coincident with the 98,000 molecular weight band."
https://openalex.org/W2404089564,"Reduced (Fe+2) carboxymethylated cytochrome c, Cm-cyt. c, undergoes a reversible pH-dependent transition with a pK of 7.16 at 20°. This pK is found to be nearly temperature-independent indicating that the over-all enthalpy for the transition is close to zero. The kinetics of this transition have been investigated by the temperature jump technique. A single well resolved relaxation process (in the millisecond time range) is observed over the pH region of the static titrations. The amplitude of this relaxation at different wave lengths fits the statically derived difference spectrum between the alkaline and acid forms of the protein. Both the amplitude and the relaxation time τ are pH dependent; the over-all enthalpy of the process is estimated to be ∼ +1 Cals per mole. The observed behavior may be accounted for by a model in which a proton-linked conformational change in the protein is responsible for the spectral changes. It is suggested that the deprotonation of an e-amino group of lysine (possibly that of lysine 79) is followed by the binding of this group to the ferrous iron to fill the vacant sixth coordination position. The observed spectral changes are attributed to the binding of a nitrogen atom to the iron. The thermodynamic parameters governing the conformational part of the reaction are calculated on the basis of the above model and values of ΔH = -10 Cals per mole and ΔS = -20 e.u. are found. These values are discussed in the context of the binding of protein residue to the iron and the consequent changes in the crevice structure."
https://openalex.org/W1521502371,"Abstract Aldolase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase were found to inhibit phosphofructokinase. The inhibition appears to be due to the depletion of fructose-1,6-P2, the substrate of both enzymes. Inhibition of phosphofructokinase by aldolase, at pH 6.9, occurred at a much faster rate (t1/2 = 15 s) than that at pH 8.2 (t1/2 = 3 min). At pH 6.9 the inhibition can be reversed by allosteric activators, whereas at pH 8.2 only fructose-1,6-P2 reversed the inhibition by aldolase. Phosphosfructokinase activity appears to be dependent on fructose-1,6-P2. This ligand can modify the activity of phosphofructokinase by its reversal of enzyme inhibition at the allosteric site. In addition, its presence at the catalytic site appears to be essential for enzymatic activity."

Corticosterone formation and lipid peroxidation in vitro were measured in these cells in response to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate ((bt)2 cAMP) in the presence and absence of ascorbate. The addition of ascorbate to adrenal cells of vitamin E-deficient rats stimulated lipid peroxidation in the presence and absence of ACTH or (bt)2 cAMP. Ascorbate inhibited ACTH-induced steroidogenesis in adrenal cells of vitamin E-deficient rats, but not in the control group. Ascorbate did not affect (bt)2 cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in either group. Intraperitoneal injection of tocopherol to the deficient rat, 16 hours prior to sacrifice, abolished the inhibitory effect of ascorbate on ACTH-induced steroidogenesis and prevented the stimulation of lipid peroxidation by ascorbate. Butylated hydroxytoluene treatment did not have any effect on lipid peroxidation or steroidogenesis in vitamin E-deficient rat adrenal cells. Addition of manganese, cobalt, EDTA, and α-tocopherol to adrenal cells from vitamin E-deficient rats in vitro reduced the inhibition of ACTH-induced steroidogenesis by ascorbate, but only the doses of EDTA and α-tocopherol (5.8 µg per ml or higher) caused diminution of lipid peroxidation. Based on these studies, we suggest that tocopherol deficiency in the presence of ascorbic acid may affect steroidogenesis through interaction of ACTH with the cell membrane prior to the formation of the second messenger."

https://openalex.org/W1485192733,"Abstract Rabbit liver mitochondria incubated in a basic medium containing pyruvate, bicarbonate, MgSO4, and Pi synthesize and liberate to the medium malate, citrate, and also aspartate (provided NH4+ is included in the medium). Only a minor amount of P-enolpyruvate is formed and liberated under these same conditions. Substrate utilization and especially metabolite production are dependent on exogenous Pi and also quite dependent on exogenous bicarbonate. Exogenous ATP inhibits substrate utilization and especially inhibits total metabolite formation. Mitochondria from 48-hour fasted rabbits or from fed alloxan diabetic rabbits as contrasted to those from normal fed rabbits appear to use more pyruvate and to synthesize significantly greater amounts of P-enolpyruvate and malate. The amounts of P-enolpyruvate formed, although larger, are still extremely small and considered insufficient to satisfy the rabbit's requirements for glucose. Cytosol prepared from livers of normal fed rabbits contain a measurable amount of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase; cytosol from livers of fasted or alloxan diabetic rabbits contain substantially greater quantities this enzyme. Refeeding of fasted rabbits diminishes the cytosolic content of carboxykinase to near normal levels. Distribution studies with cytochrome oxidase and citrate synthetase as marker enzymes confirm the in vivo existence of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in rabbit liver cytosol. Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and fumarate dehydratase activities, generally speaking, respond very little to alterations in nutritional states which substantially affect cytosolic carboxykinase. These data support the concept that cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase can contribute significantly to gluconeogenesis in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1488002996,"Abstract Bovine glutamate dehydrogenase, in the absence of coenzyme, was shown to catalyze the reversible formation of α-iminoglutarate from α-ketoglutarate and ammonia. The α-iminoglutarate was determined as glutamate following reductive trapping with sodium borohydride or sodium dithionite. The majority of the glutamate isolated was in the l configuration, indicating that a corresponding amount of the α-iminoglutarate was bound to the enzyme surface when it was reduced. Rates and equilibria for the nonenzymatic and enzymatic formation of α-iminoglutarate were determined. The amount formed in ½ min in the presence of enzyme was equivalent to 10% of the normal enzyme-mediated production of glutamate under the same conditions in the presence of NADH. The equilibrium concentration of α-imino-glutarate was increased in the presence of enzyme, indicating a binding of 0.3 mole per subunit of enzyme. This increment was about the same as the quantity of excess l isomer of glutamate formed from borohydride reduction. Substrate-competitive inhibitors decreased the amount of bound α-iminoglutarate to the same extent that they inhibited the normal catalytic reaction with NADH, and allosteric modifiers ADP, GTP, and methylmercuric chloride exerted effects on the amount of bound α-iminoglutarate reciprocal to the effects on the enzymatic reaction. Thus ADP and methylmercuric chloride decreased bound α-iminoglutarate and stimulated the catalytic reaction, and GTP increased the bound α-iminoglutarate and inhibited the enzyme catalysis. It was concluded that the rate-determining step in the measured net formation of α-iminoglutarate may have been the dissociation of α-iminoglutarate from the enzyme, and the allosteric modifiers probably acted by changing this rate. In the normal enzyme catalysis, the reduction in situ by NADH and subsequent dissociation of glutamate would presumably have a rate faster than α-iminoglutarate release. The enzyme did not catalyze the formation of N-alkyl-iminoglutarates when methylamine or benzylamine replaced ammonia. The synthesis and properties of d- and l-N-benzylpyroglutamic acid are described."
https://openalex.org/W1559989453,"Abstract The biodegradative threonine deaminase is subject to a marked inhibition by the reaction product, α-ketobutyrate, during the deamination of l-threonine when the reaction mixture lacks an effector, adenosine 5'-monophosphate. The addition of AMP to the reaction mixture at any stage during the reaction always results in an instantaneous activating or reactivating effect. Another reaction product, ammonia, has essentially no effect on the enzyme activity. The inhibition by α-ketobutyrate is characteristic in the following ways. It behaves as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the binding of AMP, and the degree of inhibition is more marked at low protein concentrations at which the tetrameric enzyme dissociates into a monomeric or a dimeric form. Furthermore, α-ketobutyrate itself can cause the enzyme to dissociate into its subunits, and conversely AMP counteracts this product-induced dissociation. Thus, the reaction product, α-ketobutyrate, appears to participate in regulating the enzyme as a kind of allosteric inhibitor, and at least one function of AMP activation is to prevent the inhibition by this product."
https://openalex.org/W1553122268,"Abstract Electron spin resonance of Cu(II) derivatives of three carbonic anhydrase isozymes, human B, human C, and bovine B, show that two of the three protein ligands to the copper ion at the metal binding site are nitrogen atoms. The copper 3/2 hyperfine line at ∼2680 gauss in the ESR spectrum of the CN- complexes of 63Cu and 65Cu human carbonic anhydrase B clearly shows five lines from two equivalent nitrogen ligands. The same ESR line in the CN- complexes of the bovine B and human C enzymes also shows five superhyperfine lines. Interpretation of the ESR spectra was substantiated by comparison of the data to spectra simulated by computer calculation of the spin Hamiltonian. It is shown that the difference in the position of copper hyperfine lines between the two naturally occurring copper isotopes caused by their differing nuclear magnetic moments is sufficient to prevent an absolute determination of the number of nitrogen ligands in a species containing mixed copper isotopes. On the other hand computer simulation of both the g|| and g⊥ regions of the ESR spectra from a pure copper isotope can be used to distinguish between two and three nitrogen ligands. The ESR spectra from all species and isozyme variants of carbonic anhydrase formed from pure copper isotopes are fit by the assumption of two rather than three nitrogen ligands. The relevance of this finding to the coordination of the native zinc ion is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1574956715,"Abstract A detailed re-examination of recently published work by two other groups on spin-labeled diisopropyl fluorophosphate analogues of trypsin has revealed that the enzyme is not irreversibly locked into a conformation dependent on its pH of inhibition (Morrisett, J.

Experiments with trypsin inhibited with 1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinylmethylphosphonofluoridate at either pH 7.7 or 5.5 conclusively show that the conformational environments of the spin label on the enzyme are identical when observed at acidic pH. The apparent difficulties in the earlier work arose primarily from the misassignment of autolyzed spin-labeled trypsin for an active form of the enzyme. The predominant active forms, α- and β-trypsin, appear to have conformationally identical active sites by this method. Furthermore, this spin label detects the same active site conformational environment at either neutral or acidic pH."
https://openalex.org/W2420918189,"A method is described for the preparation of highly purified fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) from the liver of the fish Genypterus chilensis. The purification procedure consists of only three steps, extraction at pH 3.5, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and P-cellulose chromatography. The purified enzyme appears to be homogeneous by the criteria of ultracentrifugation and disc gel electrophoresis. As with other fructose 1,6-diphosphatases, the fish liver enzyme shows allosteric AMP inhibition. The inhibition increases with decreasing temperature, and it is also increased by the presence of 150 m m KCl. However, the cooperative interaction among AMP binding sites is independent of temperature and potassium ions. When studied at the same temperature, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase from G. chilensis is much less sensitive to AMP inhibition than rabbit liver fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. However, a comparative study showed that the AMP inhibition curve obtained for the mammalian liver enzyme at 35° falls between the 5 and 15° experimental curves of the fish liver enzyme, in agreement with the physiological temperature range of G. chilensis (7 to 13°). These results are taken as an example of temperature adaptation at the enzymatic level in which a change in enzyme-effector affinity is sufficient to provide an efficient mechanism for the regulation of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase in this poikilotherm."
https://openalex.org/W2337145487,"Abstract When supernatant fluid fractions of rat adipose tissue homogenates prepared in water, 0.25 m sucrose, or 0.15 m KCl were incubated at 30° with ATP, MgCl2, and Tris buffer, pH 7.4, lipase activity decreased. On passage over Sephadex G-25, all of the lipase activity of the fluid fraction emerged in the exclusion volume, but was inactivated by ATP and MgCl2 only when material from the later column fractions was added back. Inactivation of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated hormone-sensitive lipase required ATP (g0.5 mm), MgCl2 at a molar concentration in excess of that of ATP, and a factor(s) present in the same Sephadex G-25 fractions. Since inactivation was completely prevented by 50 µm EDTA in the presence of excess Mg++ ion, another cation may be required. The conditions chosen were essentially optimal for demonstration of inactivation of ammonium sulfate-precipitated lipase dependent on the addition of ATP, MgCl2, and the Sephadex G-25 fraction. At lower pH or temperature, the rate of this process was decreased; at 40° or at higher pH, inactivation not dependent on these additions increased. Inactivation was almost completely prevented in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. GTP or creatine phosphate, but not AMP or sodium pyrophosphate, could replace ATP, but no substitute for MgCl2 was found. Inactivation could be decreased or abolished by the addition of 30 µm cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This effect of cyclic AMP was prevented by the addition of protein kinase inhibitor from skeletal muscle (Gilman, A. (1970) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 67, 305–312). Inactivation was proportional to the amount of the lipase fraction added in the presence of Sephadex G-25 fraction from an equal or greater amount of tissue, and was proportional to the latter in the presence of lipase derived from more than twice as much tissue."
