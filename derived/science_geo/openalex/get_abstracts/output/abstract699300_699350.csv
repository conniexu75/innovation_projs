https://openalex.org/W4293103475,"The fluorescent derivative of glucose, 2-Deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-amino]-D-glucose (2NBDG), is a widely used surrogate reagent to visualize glucose uptake in live cells at single cell resolution. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in 5TGM1 myeloma cells, we demonstrate that ablation of the glucose transporter gene Slc2a1 abrogates radioactive glucose uptake but has no effect on the magnitude or kinetics of 2NBDG import. Extracellular 2NBDG, but not NBD-fructose was transported by primary plasma cells into the cytoplasm suggesting a specific mechanism that is unlinked from glucose import and that of chemically similar compounds. Neither excess glucose nor pharmacological inhibition of GLUT1 impacted 2NBDG uptake in myeloma cells or primary splenocytes. Genetic ablation of other expressed hexose transporters individually or in combination with one another also had no impact on 2NBDG uptake. Ablation of the genes in the Slc29 and Slc35 families of nucleoside and nucleoside sugar transporters also failed to impact 2NBDG import. Thus, cellular uptake of 2NBDG is not necessarily a faithful indicator of glucose transport and is promoted by an unknown mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4293104612,"The tropical lineage within the Rhipicephalus sanguineus species complex is cause for growing concern in the U.S. based on its prominent role in creating and perpetuating multiple recently identified outbreaks of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This lineage is undergoing a northward range expansion in the United States, necessitating the need for enhanced surveillance for Rh. sanguineus. To inform more focused surveillance efforts we use species distribution models (SDMs) to predict current (2015-2019) and future (2021-2040) habitat for the tropical lineage. Models using the MaxEnt algorithm were informed using geolocations of ticks genetically confirmed to be of the tropical lineage, for which data on 23 climatic and ecological variables were extracted. Models predicted that suitability was optimal where temperatures are relatively warm and stable, and there is minimal precipitation. This translated into habitat being predicted along much of the coast of southern states including California, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Although the endophilic nature of tropical Rh. sanguineus somewhat violates the assumptions of SDMs, our models correctly predicted known locations of this tick and provide a starting point for increased surveillance efforts. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of using molecular methods to distinguish between ticks in the Rh. sanguineus species complex."
https://openalex.org/W4293105030,"Recent research has shown that social media services create large consumer surplus. Despite their positive impact on economic welfare, concerns are raised about the negative association between social media usage and well-being or performance. However, causal empirical evidence is still scarce. To address this research gap, we conduct a randomized controlled trial among students in which we track participants’ daily digital activities over the course of three quarters of an academic year. In the experiment, we randomly allocate half of the sample to a treatment condition in which social media usage (Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat) is restricted to a maximum of 10 minutes per day. We find that participants in the treatment group substitute social media for instant messaging and do not decrease their total time spent on digital devices. Contrary to findings from previous correlational studies, we do not find any significant impact of social media usage as it was defined in our study on well-being and academic success. Our results also suggest that antitrust authorities should consider instant messaging and social media services as direct competitors before approving acquisitions."
https://openalex.org/W4293101378,"Introduction An estimated 1.5 million cases were reported in Pakistan until 23 March, 2022. However, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing capacity has been limited and the incidence of COVID-19 infections is unknown. Volunteer healthy blood donors can be a control population for assessment of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the population. We determined COVID-19 seroprevalence during the second pandemic wave in Karachi in donors without known infections or symptoms in 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Materials and methods We enrolled 558 healthy blood donors at the Aga Khan University Hospital between December 2020 and February 2021. ABO blood groups were determined. Serum IgG reactivity were measured to spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. Results Study subjects were predominantly males (99.1%) with a mean age of 29.0±7.4 years. Blood groups were represented by; B (35.8%), O (33.3%), A (23.8%) and AB (7%). Positive IgG responses to spike were detected in 53.4% (95% CI, 49.3–37.5) of blood donors. Positive IgG antibodies to RBD were present in 16.7% (95% CI; 13.6–19.8) of individuals. No significant difference was found between the frequency of IgG antibodies to spike or RBD across age groups. Frequencies of IgG to Spike and RBD antibodies between December 2020 and February 2021 were found to be similar. Seropositivity to either antigen between individuals of different blood groups did not differ. Notably, 31.2% of individuals with IgG antibodies to spike also had IgG antibodies to RBD. Amongst donors who had previously confirmed COVID-19 and were seropositive to spike, 40% had IgG to RBD. Conclusions Our study provides insights into the seroprevalence of antibodies to COVID-19 in a healthy cohort in Karachi. The differential dynamics of IgG to spike and RBD likely represent both exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and associate with protective immunity in the population."
https://openalex.org/W4293102454,"The burial of Individual 3 at the Newen Antug site, a young adult woman, with a pottery grave offering characteristic of the Late Pottery period and dated to 880 years BP, is an indirect burial in a wooden structure. The form and design comprise a wooden wampo or small canoe, or a symbolic representation of one, a metaphor in current and historical Mapuche society for the voyage to the final abode of the dead, located beyond a water body which must be crossed in a boat. This is the first find of a burial in a canoe structure in Argentinian Patagonia, and the most southern example on the whole continent. It is also the earliest record in Argentina of pottery of the Red on White Bichrome tradition used as a grave offering, extending the repertoire of characteristics shared between the two slopes of the Andes mountains during the pottery periods, including ritual as well as material aspects."
https://openalex.org/W4293103760,"Social factors are recognized determinants of morbidity and mortality and also have an impact on use of medical services. The objective of this study was to assess the associations of educational attainment, social and financial resources, and migration factors with length of hospital stays for chronic conditions. In addition, the study investigated the role of comorbidity and discharge destination in mediating these associations. The study made use of nationwide inpatient data that was linked with Swiss census data. The study sample included n = 141,307 records of n = 92,623 inpatients aged 25 to 84 years, hospitalized between 2010 and 2016 for a chronic condition. Cross-classified multilevel models and mediation analysis were performed. Patients with upper secondary and compulsory education stayed longer in hospital compared to those with tertiary education (β 0.24 days, 95% CI 0.14-0.33; β 0.37, 95% CI 0.27-0.47, respectively) when taking into account demographic factors, main diagnosis and clustering on patient and hospital level. However, these effects were almost fully mediated by burden of comorbidity. The effect of living alone on length of stay (β 0.60 days, 95% CI 0.50-0.70) was partially mediated by both burden of comorbidities (33%) and discharge destination (30.4%). (Semi-) private insurance was associated with prolonged stays, but an inverse effect was observed for colon and breast cancer. Allophone patients had also prolonged hospital stays (β 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.55). Hospital stays could be a window of opportunity to discern patients who need additional time and support to better cope with everyday life after discharge, reducing the risks of future hospital stays. However, inpatient care in Switzerland seems to take into account rather obvious individual needs due to lack of immediate support at home, but not necessarily more hidden needs of patients with low health literacy and less resources to assert their interests within the health system."
https://openalex.org/W4293105275,"In Thailand, 17% of the population lives by the coast, approximately 11 million people. A combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and coastal land subsidence are critical issues threatening the livelihoods of coastal communities. Thailand has invested a lot of money and installed conservation policies to restore and protect coastal mangroves and realign or replenish their beaches. This study assessed the use of the toolkit Coastsat to digitise a time series of shoreline positions from open access satellite images between 1990 and 2019 along 560 km of coastline in the provinces of Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat (NST). Based on these digitised shorelines and the use of the software Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), it was possible to identify shoreline change, which varied between -66 to +16.4 m/y in the mangroves of NST and -22.2 to +10.6 m/year on its sandy beaches. Shoreline change rates along the Krabi coast varied -34.5 to +21.7 m/year in the mangroves and -4.1 to +4 m/year on sandy beaches. Analysis of the spatial and temporal variations of the shoreline position during the survey period reveals a linkage between extreme weather conditions and coastal erosion along the NST coast while that linkage is less clear along the Krabi coast. CoastSat delivers crucial and accurate time series shoreline data over extensive areas that are vital to coastal managers and researchers in a completely remote manner, which is key with the presence of COVID-19 travel bans."
https://openalex.org/W3202511111,"The key role played by host-microbiota interactions on human health, disease onset and progression, and on host response to treatments has increasingly emerged in the latest decades. Indeed, dysbiosis has been associated to several human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and also neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson, Huntington and Alzheimer's disease (AD), although whether causative, consequence or merely an epiphenomenon is still under investigation. In the present study, we performed a metabologenomic analysis of stool samples from a mouse model of AD, the 3xTgAD. We found a significant change in the microbiota of AD mice compared to WT, with a longitudinal divergence of the F/B ratio, a parameter suggesting a gut dysbiosis. Moreover, AD mice showed a significant decrease of some amino acids, while data integration revealed a dysregulated production of desaminotyrosine (DAT) and dihydro-3-coumaric acid. Collectively, our data show a dysregulated gut microbiota associated to the onset and progression of AD, also indicating that a dysbiosis can occur prior to significant clinical signs, evidenced by early SCFA alterations, compatible with gut inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4293084510,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has seen repeated government enforced restrictions on movement. This study aimed to evaluate longitudinal trends in physical activity (PA) in a self-selected UK-based sample and identify the key correlates of these trends. Methods From 23 April 2020 to 30 January 2021, measures of PA engagement were collected in a sample of 1,947 UK-based adults. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) explored trends in PA engagement over time, and how sociodemographic, health and contextual factors impacted participant’s attainment of World Health Organization (WHO) recommended levels of PA (constituting muscle strengthening activity (MSA), and moderate or vigorous PA (MVPA)). Results While one in five achieved the recommended levels of PA in the first UK lockdown in April-June 2020 (19.5%, 95%CI: 17.8–21.3%) and a similar proportion in June-July 2020 (17.7%, 95%CI: 16.1–19.5%), this reduced during the period of eased restrictions in August-September 2020 (15.2%, 95%CI: 13.7–16.9%) and the second UK lockdown in November 2020-January 2021 (14.1%, 95%CI: 12.6–15.9%). Similar trends were observed for MSA and MVPA individually. Better quality of life, higher socioeconomic position and pre-COVID-19 PA levels were associated with meeting the WHO recommended levels of PA, while those living with overweight or obesity, a limiting health condition, or isolating showed the inverse associations. Time-specific associations with MSA or MVPA were observed for gender and age. Conclusion Reductions in PA levels throughout the first strict lockdown continued without reversal during the ensuing period. The association of negative change with socioeconomic and health-related indices points towards deepening health inequities during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4293102161,"Spatial and temporal variability in the availability of food resources will lead to variation in a species' diet, which can then influence patterns of space use, sociality, and life history characteristics. Despite such potential impacts, little information is available about dietary variability for some species with large geographical ranges. Here we quantify the diet and nutritional content of plants consumed by western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Loango National Park, Gabon over a 2.6 year period and make comparisons with two study sites located 800 km away. The major foods consumed by the Loango gorillas differed greatly from the other two study sites, but gorillas at all three locations spent a similar proportion of feeding time consuming herbaceous vegetation and tree leaves (~ 50%) and fruit (35%). The Loango gorillas spent approximately 10% of feeding time eating nuts, which were not consumed at the other two study sites. Gorillas at those sites spent about 5% of feeding time eating insects, which were not consumed by Loango gorillas. Even though the species composition of the diet differed among the three sites, the nutritional composition of the major food items differed very little, suggesting that western gorillas consume foods of similar nutritional values to meet their dietary needs. This study shows the flexibility of diet of a species with a wide geographic distribution, which has implications for understanding variation in life history characteristics and can be useful for conservation management plans."
https://openalex.org/W4293102386,"Background Vaccination is indeed one of the interventional strategies available to combat coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study emphasizes the relevance of citizens’ acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in assisting global recovery from the pandemic and aiding the tourism industries to return to normalcy. This study further presented the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism industry in China. Also, the study confirmed the past performance of tourism in China to the current tourism-related COVID-19 effects from a global perspective by employing Australia’s outbound tourism data from 2008 to 2020 on top 6 destinations, including China, Indonesia, New Zealand, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Methods Jeffrey’s Amazing Statistical Program (JASP) was used to analyze this study. The JASP statistical software was employed to accurately analyze the vaccines administered in China from December 15, 2020, to March 28, 2021. Results The study results demonstrate an overwhelming acceptance of vaccines in China which will positively and significantly impact the globe’s travel and tourism industries. Also, the study findings indicated that industries in tourism are hopeful of regaining the past losses. Further, the study results showed an enormous decline in death and new cases. Conclusion Vaccine acceptance is relevant for the eradication of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, neighborhood and individual-level acceptance of the vaccine will help reduce the challenges facing the tourism industries and the world. The researchers recommend that authorities should strictly check the vaccination certificates of visitors. Furthermore, hoteliers should put adequate measures to monitor all visitors who visit the various tourist destinations."
https://openalex.org/W4293103176,"Background COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is a common practice in developing countries like Ethiopia. Despite there being a rumor from the community that the use of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is associated with many pregnancy adverse outcomes. However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy in Ethiopia. This study assessed the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and associated factors in Motta town and Hulet Eji Enese district, northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from December 12 to February 12, 2021. A total of 851 women’ were selected using the stratified cluster sampling technique. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a semi-structured pretested and interviewer-administered questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval at a p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to declare the level of significance. Results Perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was 34.2% (95%CI (Confidence Interval): 31–37). Unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 3.66; 95%CI: 2.31–5.81), long travel time to the nearby health care facility (AOR: 4.57; 95% CI: 2.34–8.91), have no formal education (AOR: 3.15; 95%CI: 1.71–5.79), attending secondary educational level (AOR: 5.18; 95% CI: 2.17–12.4), no ANC (Antenatal Care) service utilization (AOR: 7.07; 95% CI: 4.35–11.5) and negative attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (AOR: 6.05; 95%CI: 3.88–9.43) were significantly associated with the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Conclusions Most of the participants perceive COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy as a risk for the outcome of pregnancy. Designing strategies to increase women’s educational status, promoting the need for maternal and child health services, and awareness creation regarding COVID-19 vaccination will have a great role in changing the perception of pregnant women. Therefore, the government should design public health programs targeting the identified factor, and should minimize the perception of risk acquiring infection from COVID-19 vaccine to improve maternal and neonatal health outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4293104247,"Burial elaborations are a human behaviour that, in recent contexts can inform on social diversification, belief systems, and the introduction of new practices resulting from migration or cultural transmission. The study of mortuary practices in Mainland and Island Southeast Asia has revealed complex and diverse treatments of the deceased. This paper contributes to this topic with the description of three new burials excavated in Tron Bon Lei (Alor Island, Indonesia) dated to 7.5, 10, and 12 kya cal BP. In addition to the bioskeletal profiles and palaeohealth observations, we propose the adoption of archaeothanatological methods to characterise burial types in the region. Through the analysis of skeletal element representation, body position, articulation, and grave associations, we provide an example of a holistic approach to mortuary treatments in the Lesser Sunda Islands. Our results provide significant new data for understanding the evolution and diversification of burial practices in Southeast Asia, contributing to a growing body of literature describing prehistoric socio-cultural behaviour in this region."
https://openalex.org/W4293105183,"Previous studies have reported that motor behavior is affected by short-term physical inactivity using cast immobilization; however, the effects of inactivity on postural sway are not well-understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term lower limb disuse on postural sway in the upright position after cast removal. Twenty-two healthy young adults were enrolled, and each participant’s lower limb on one side was fixed with a soft bandage and medical splint made from metal and soft urethane for 10 h. Fluctuations in the center of pressure (COP) were measured before and after immobilization; the total trajectory length, mean velocity, COP root mean square (RMS) area, mean medial-lateral (M-L) COP, and mean anterior-posterior (A-P) COP were selected as evaluation parameters. Compared with the postural sway before cast application, we noted an increase and shift (from the fixed to the nonfixed side) in the postural sway after cast removal. Our results therefore suggest that short-term disuse may cause acute changes in COP movements during quiet standing. Moreover, patients may maintain their standing posture by adopting a compensatory strategy involving lateral control, similar to individuals with stroke and patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty."
https://openalex.org/W4293105203,"Background Health care workers (HCW), particularly immigrants and ethnic minorities are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes during a COVID-19 associated hospitalization are not well described among HCW. We aimed to describe the characteristics of HCW admitted with COVID-19 including immigrant status and ethnicity and the associated risk factors for Intensive Care unit (ICU) admission and death. Methods Adults with laboratory-confirmed community-acquired COVID-19 hospitalized from March 1 to June 30, 2020, at four tertiary-care hospitals in Montréal, Canada were included. Demographics, comorbidities, occupation, immigration status, country of birth, ethnicity, workplace exposures, and hospital outcomes (ICU admission and death) were obtained through a chart review and phone survey. A Fine and Gray competing risk proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of ICU admission among HCW stratified by immigrant status and region of birth. Results Among 1104 included persons, 150 (14%) were HCW, with a phone survey participation rate of 68%. HCWs were younger (50 vs 64 years; p &lt;0.001), more likely to be female (61% vs 41%; p &lt;0.001), migrants (68% vs 55%; p &lt;0.01), non-White (65% vs 41%; p &lt;0.001) and healthier (mean Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0.3 vs 1.2; p &lt;0.001) compared to non-HCW. They were as likely to be admitted to the ICU (28% vs 31%; p = 0.40) but were less likely to die (4% vs. 17%; p &lt;0.001). Immigrant HCW accounted for 68% of all HCW cases and, compared to Canadian HCW, were more likely to be personal support workers (PSW) (54% vs. 33%, p &lt;0.01), to be Black (58% vs 4%) and to work in a Residential Care Facility (RCF) (59% vs 33%; p = 0.05). Most HCW believed that they were exposed at work, 55% did not always have access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and 40% did not receive COVID-19-specific Infection Control (IPAC) training. Conclusion Immigrant HCW were particularly exposed to COVID-19 infection in the first wave of the pandemic in Quebec. Despite being young and healthy, one third of all HCW required ICU admission, highlighting the importance of preventing workplace transmission through strong infection prevention and control measures, including high COVID-19 vaccination coverage."
https://openalex.org/W4293105253,"The adoption of journal policies requiring authors to include a Data Availability Statement has helped to increase the availability of research data associated with research articles. However, having a Data Availability Statement is not a guarantee that readers will be able to locate the data; even if provided with an identifier like a uniform resource locator (URL) or a digital object identifier (DOI), the data may become unavailable due to link rot and content drift. To explore the long-term availability of resources including data, code, and other digital research objects associated with papers, this study extracted 8,503 URLs and DOIs from a corpus of nearly 50,000 Data Availability Statements from papers published in PLOS ONE between 2014 and 2016. These URLs and DOIs were used to attempt to retrieve the data through both automated and manual means. Overall, 80% of the resources could be retrieved automatically, compared to much lower retrieval rates of 10-40% found in previous papers that relied on contacting authors to locate data. Because a URL or DOI might be valid but still not point to the resource, a subset of 350 URLs and 350 DOIs were manually tested, with 78% and 98% of resources, respectively, successfully retrieved. Having a DOI and being shared in a repository were both positively associated with availability. Although resources associated with older papers were slightly less likely to be available, this difference was not statistically significant, suggesting that URLs and DOIs may be an effective means for accessing data over time. These findings point to the value of including URLs and DOIs in Data Availability Statements to ensure access to data on a long-term basis."
https://openalex.org/W4293105410,"In addition to the intrinsic value of the product, social, cultural and psychological factors also have a major influence on the consumer’s purchasing decision. They are also influenced by trends and tendencies such as globalisation, digitalisation and various economic and social crises. In our study, we focused on the analysis of food purchasing preferences; including the reasons for the rise of ethnocentrism in the purchase of domestic products and the potential of this phenomenon in light of relevant secondary data and quantitative primary results. The main objective of the study’s primary research is to demonstrate that consumer groups, distinguishable by food consumption preferences, have differentiated perceptions of domestic food (price, quality, reliability). This provides evidence that food consumer preferences are reflected in decisions about domestic food. Due to the Hungarian relevance of the topic, the presentation of related international research and literature was given a prominent role. The focus of our research was to investigate the food purchasing preferences of Hungarian food consumers. Based on the results, we were able to characterise distinct consumer segments based on food purchasing preferences, and we were able to identify potential target groups of domestic food based on food consumer preferences: the ‘conscious food buyers’, the ‘impulse buyers’ and the ‘no preference’. In our view, members belonging to the first two segments can be successfully persuaded to buy Hungarian food through an educational campaign based on sufficiently fashionable and trendy motifs with the help of the right reference person."
https://openalex.org/W4293105643,"One of the renewable energy resources, wind energy is widely used due to its wide distribution, large reserves, green and clean energy, and it is also an important part of large-scale grid integration. However, wind power has strong randomness, volatility, anti-peaking characteristics, and the problem of low wind power prediction accuracy, which brings serious challenges to the power system. Based on the difference of power prediction error and confidence interval between different new energy power stations, an optimal control strategy for active power of wind farms was proposed. Therefore, we focus on solving the problem of wind power forecasting and improving the accuracy of wind power prediction. Due to the prediction error of wind power generation, the power control cannot meet the control target. An optimal control strategy for active power of wind farms is proposed based on the difference in power prediction error and confidence interval between different new energy power stations. The strategy used historical data to evaluate the prediction error distribution and confidence interval of wind power. We use confidence interval constraints to create a wind power active optimization model that realize active power distribution and complementary prediction errors among wind farms with asymmetric error distribution. Combined with the actual data of a domestic (Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh) wind power base, a simulation example is designed to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4293084490,"We propose an anisotropic constrained-boundary convolutional neural networks (hereafter, AnisoCBConvNet) that can stably express high-quality meshes without oscillation by applying super-resolution operations to low-resolution cloth meshes. As a training set for the neural network, we use a pair between simulation data of low resolution (LR) cloth and data obtained by applying the same simulation to high resolution (HR) cloth with increased quad mesh resolution of LR cloth. The actual data used for training are 2D geometry images converted from 3D meshes. The proposed AnisoCBConvNet is used to train an image synthesizer that converts LR geometry images to HR geometry images. In particular, by controlling the weights anisotropically near the boundary, the problem of surface wrinkling caused by oscillation is alleviated. When the HR geometry image obtained through AnisoCBConvNet is converted back to the HR cloth mesh, details including wrinkles are expressed better than the input cloth mesh. In addition, our results improved the noise problem in the existing geometry image approach. We tested AnisoCBConvNet-based super-resolution in various simulation scenarios, and confirmed stable and efficient performance in most of the results. By using our method, it will be possible to effectively produce CG VFX created using high-quality cloth simulation in games and movies."
https://openalex.org/W4293103510,"The purpose of the current study was to use a social determinants of health (SDOH) framework and latent class analysis (LCA) to identify risk classes among mothers with young children. The risk classes were then used to predict food insecurity severity and stability/change of food insecurity over time.The secondary data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 2,368; oversampled for non-marital births) was used in this study. Household food insecurity was assessed using the 18-items USDA Food Security Survey. A seventeen-item inventory of educational, economic stability, incarceration (i.e. social context), neighborhood safety (i.e. neighborhood and built environment), health and health care, and substance use behaviors at baseline/Year-1 were included to identify SDOH risk indicators in the LCA. Covariate-adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the relation between risk classes at Year-1 and the severity of food insecurity at Year-3 and stability/change of food insecurity between Year-3 and Year -5.LCA identified five risk classes: High utility and medical hardship (Class 1), high housing and employment hardship, high substance use, and incarceration (Class 2), high housing and medical hardship, poor health, and health care (Class 3), high employment hardship and low-income (Class 4) and low-risk (Class 5). The Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 had greater odds of low food security and very low food security at Year-3 compared to Class 4. In addition, compared to Class 4, Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 had greater odds unstable food insecurity and persistent food insecurity over time.LCA could be used to identify distinctive family system risk profiles predictive of food insecurity. The generated risk profiles could be used by health care providers as an additional tool to identify families in need for resources to ensure household food security."
https://openalex.org/W4293104218,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a systemic vascular disease of the legs that results in a blockage of blood flow from the heart to the lower extremities. Now one of the most common causes of mortality in the U.S., the first line of therapy for PAD is to mechanically open the blockages using balloon angioplasty. Coating the balloons with antiproliferative agents can potentially reduce vessel re-narrowing, or restenosis after surgical intervention, but current drug-coated balloons releasing chemotherapy agents like paclitaxel have in some cases shown increased mortality long-term. Our aim was to design a novel drug-coated balloon using a polymeric nanodelivery system for a sustained release of polyphenols that reduce restenosis but with reduced toxicity compared to chemotherapy agents. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with entrapped quercetin, a dimethoxy quercetin (rhamnazin), as well as quercetin covalently attached to PLGA, were developed. Balloon catheters were coated with polymeric nanoparticles using an ultrasonic method, and nanoparticle characteristics, drug loading, coating uniformity and drug release were determined. The adhesion of nanoparticles to vascular smooth muscle cells and the antiproliferative effect of nano-delivered polyphenols were also assessed. Of the nanoparticle systems tested, those with covalently attached quercetin provided the most sustained release over a 6-day period. Although these particles adhered to cells to a smaller extent compared to other nanoparticle formulations, their attachment was resistant to washing. These particles also exhibited the greatest anti-proliferative effect. In addition, their attachment was not altered when the cells were grown in calcifying conditions, and in PAD tissue calcification is typically a condition that impedes drug delivery. Moreover, the ultrasonic coating method generated a uniform balloon coating. The polymeric nanoparticle system with covalently attached quercetin developed herein is thus proposed as a promising platform to reduce restenosis post-angioplasty."
https://openalex.org/W4293105582,"Background Advances in climate change research contribute to improved forecasts of hydrological extremes with potentially severe impacts on human societies and natural landscapes. Rainfall erosivity density (RED), i.e. rainfall erosivity (MJ mm hm -2 h -1 yr -1 ) per rainfall unit (mm), is a measure of rainstorm aggressiveness and a proxy indicator of damaging hydrological events. Methods and findings Here, using downscaled RED data from 3,625 raingauges worldwide and log-normal ordinary kriging with probability mapping, we identify damaging hydrological hazard-prone areas that exceed warning and alert thresholds (1.5 and 3.0 MJ hm -2 h -1 , respectively). Applying exceedance probabilities in a geographical information system shows that, under current climate conditions, hazard-prone areas exceeding a 50% probability cover ~31% and ~19% of the world’s land at warning and alert states, respectively. Conclusion RED is identified as a key driver behind the spatial growth of environmental disruption worldwide (with tropical Latin America, South Africa, India and the Indian Archipelago most affected)."

In the absence of approved vaccines for infants, understanding characteristics associated with hospitalization and severe disease from COVID-19 in this age group will help inform clinical management and public health interventions. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, disease severity, and characteristics associated with hospitalization among infants infected with the initial strains of SARS-CoV-2.This is a national, prospective study of infants with SARS-CoV-2 from April 8th 2020 to May 31st 2021 using the infrastructure of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program. Infants <1 year of age with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from both inpatients and outpatients seen in clinics and emergency departments were included. Cases were classified as either: 1) Non-hospitalized patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 2) COVID-19-related hospitalization; or 3) non-COVID-19-related hospitalization (e.g., incidentally detected SARS-CoV-2). Case severity was defined as asymptomatic, outpatient care, mild (inpatient care), moderate or severe disease. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify characteristics associated with hospitalization.A total of 531 cases were reported, including 332 (62.5%) non-hospitalized and 199 (37.5%) hospitalized infants. Among hospitalized infants, 141 of 199 infants (70.9%) were admitted because of COVID-19-related illness, and 58 (29.1%) were admitted for reasons other than acute COVID-19. Amongst all cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the most common presenting symptoms included fever (66.5%), coryza (47.1%), cough (37.3%) and decreased oral intake (25.0%). In our main analysis, infants with a comorbid condition had higher odds of hospitalization compared to infants with no comorbid conditions (aOR = 4.53, 2.06-9.97), and infants <1 month had higher odds of hospitalization then infants aged 1-3 months (aOR = 3.78, 1.97-7.26). In total, 20 infants (3.8%) met criteria for severe disease.We describe one of the largest cohorts of infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, severe COVID-19 in this age group was found to be uncommon. Comorbid conditions and younger age were associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization amongst infants."
https://openalex.org/W3134296349,"Many studies have considered temperature trends at the global scale, but the literature is commonly associated with an overall increase in mean temperature in a defined past time period and hence lacking in in-depth analysis of the latent trends. For example, in addition to heterogeneity in mean and median values, daily temperature data often exhibit quasi-periodic heterogeneity in variance, which has largely been overlooked in climate research. To this end, we propose a joint model of quantile regression and variability. By accounting appropriately for the heterogeneity in these types of data, our analysis using Australian data reveals that daily maximum temperature is warming by ∼0.21°C per decade and daily minimum temperature by ∼0.13°C per decade. More interestingly, our modeling also shows nuanced patterns of change over space and time depending on location, season, and the percentiles of the temperature series."

A multivariate logistic regression model was used for data analysis.A total of 1,273 participants (90.7% female, 85.8% university faculty) were included in the analysis. This survey showed that no evidence of a significant gender gap was found in research activities in Japanese nursing researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research activities during the pandemic were associated with time and motivation."
https://openalex.org/W4293102600,"Background Practice facilitators (PFs) provide tailored support to primary care practices to improve the quality of care delivery. Often used by PFs, the “Key Driver Implementation Scale” (KDIS) measures the degree to which a practice implements quality improvement activities from the Chronic Care Model, but the scale’s psychometric properties have not been investigated. We examined construct validity, reliability, floor and ceiling effects, and a longitudinal trend test of the KDIS items in the Southeastern Collaboration to Improve Blood Pressure Control trial. Methods The KDIS items assess a practice’s progress toward implementing: a clinical information system (using their own data to drive change); standardized care processes; optimized team care; patient self-management support; and leadership support. We assessed construct validity and estimated reliability with a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A trend test examined whether the KDIS items increased over time and estimated the expected number of months needed to move a practice to the highest response options. Results PFs completed monthly KDIS ratings over 12 months for 32 primary care practices, yielding a total of 384 observations. Data was fitted to a unidimensional CFA model; however, parameter fit was modest and could be improved. Reliability was 0.70. Practices started scoring at the highest levels beginning in month 5, indicating low variability. The KDIS items did show an upward trend over 12 months (all p &lt; .001), indicating that practices were increasingly implementing key activities. The expected time to move a practice to the highest response category was 9.1 months for standardized care processes, 10.2 for clinical information system, 12.6 for self-management support, 13.1 for leadership, and 14.3 months for optimized team care. Conclusions The KDIS items showed acceptable reliability, but work is needed in larger sample sizes to determine if two or more groups of implementation activities are being measured rather than one."

https://openalex.org/W4293103246,"Video cameras are finding increasing use in the study and analysis of bird flight over short ranges. However, reconstruction of flight trajectories in three dimensions typically requires the use of multiple cameras and elaborate calibration procedures. We present an alternative approach that uses a single video camera and a simple calibration procedure for the reconstruction of such trajectories. The technique combines prior knowledge of the wingspan of the bird with a camera calibration procedure that needs to be used only once in the lifetime of the system. The system delivers the exact 3D coordinates of the position of the bird at the time of every full wing extension and uses interpolated height estimates to compute the 3D positions of the bird in the video frames between successive wing extensions. The system is inexpensive, compact and portable, and can be easily deployed in the laboratory as well as the field."
https://openalex.org/W4293103878,"Purpose Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and leads to the maladaptive changes in myocardium. Endothelial cells (ECs) undergoing mesenchymal transition contributes to the occurrence and development of cardiac fibrosis. CD146 is an adhesion molecule highly expressed in ECs. The present study was performed to explore the role of CD146 in modulating endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Methods C57BL/6 mice were subjected to subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipump infused with angiotensin II (Ang Ⅱ). Adenovirus carrying CD146 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or CD146 encoding sequence were infected into cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) followed by stimulation with Ang II or transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Differentially expressed genes were revealed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR, and protein expression and distribution were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Results CD146 was predominantly expressed by ECs in normal mouse hearts. CD146 was upregulated in ECs but not fibroblasts and myocytes in hearts of Ang II-infused mice and in HUVECs stimulated with Ang Ⅱ. RNA-Seq analysis revealed the differentially expressed genes related to EndMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. CD146 knockdown and overexpression facilitated and attenuated, respectively, EndMT induced by Ang II or TGF-β1. CD146 knockdown upregulated Wnt pathway-related genes including Wnt4 , LEF1 , HNF4A , FOXA1 , SOX6 , and CCND3 , and increased the protein level and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Conclusions Knockdown of CD146 exerts promotional effects on EndMT via activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the upregulation of CD146 might play a protective role against EndMT and cardiac fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4293104850,"The rail transit vehicle system is an important subsystem with the most frequent operation accidents and the most direct impact on passengers. Based on the particularity of the vehicle system and the complexity of the system, the hierarchical analysis method (AHP) is used to evaluate its safety. High-order judgment matrix often has inconsistency, and the judgment matrix consistency guarantee is the key to the hierarchical analysis method applied. Based on the hierarchical analysis principle, this paper corrects the inconsistency judgment matrix and realizes the optimization calculation based on the genetic algorithm. This paper constructs a vehicle system safety evaluation index system including 26 indexes at three layers and uses the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the system safety level. The results show that the calculation results based on the improved AHP-GA are significantly better than that based on the conventional AHP method. The comprehensive evaluation conclusion of the case is ""average"", and the safety level of the vehicle system of the case enterprise needs to be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W4293105378,"With the global spread of COVID-19, the governments advised the public for adopting safety precautions to limit its spread. The virus spreads from people, contaminated places, and nozzle droplets that necessitate strict precautionary measures. Consequently, different safety precautions have been implemented to fight COVID-19 such as wearing a facemask, restriction of social gatherings, keeping 6 feet distance, etc. Despite the warnings, highlighted need for such measures, and the increasing severity of the pandemic situation, the expected number of people adopting these precautions is low. This study aims at assessing and understanding the public perception of COVID-19 safety precautions, especially the use of facemask. A unified framework of sentiment lexicon with the proposed ensemble EB-DT is devised to analyze sentiments regarding safety precautions. Extensive experiments are performed with a large dataset collected from Twitter. In addition, the factors leading to a negative perception of safety precautions are analyzed by performing topic analysis using the Latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm. The experimental results reveal that 12% of the tweets correspond to negative sentiments towards facemask precaution mainly by its discomfort. Analysis of change in peoples' sentiment over time indicates a gradual increase in the positive sentiments regarding COVID-19 restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W4293105604,"To facilitate implementation of home-based care following an elective total knee or hip replacement in a private hospital, we explored patient and caregiver barriers and enablers and components of care that may increase its acceptability.Thirty-one patients (mean age 71 years, 77% female) and 14 caregivers (mean age 69 years, 57% female) were interviewed. All themes were developed using thematic analysis, then categorised as barriers or enablers to uptake of home-based care or acceptable components of care. Barrier and enabler themes were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework.Eight themes emerged as barriers or enablers: feeling unsafe versus confident; caregivers' willingness to provide support and patients' unwillingness to seek help; less support and opportunity to rest; positive feelings about home over the hospital; certainty about anticipated recovery; trusting specialist advice over family and friends; length of hospital stay; paying for health insurance. Five themes emerged as acceptable components: home visits prior to discharge; specific information about recovery at home; one-to-one physiotherapy and occupational therapy perceived as first-line care; medical, nursing and a 24/7 direct-line perceived as second-line care for complications; no one-size-fits-all model for domestic support. Theoretical domains relating to barriers included emotion (e.g., feeling unsafe), environmental context and resources (e.g., perceived lack of physiotherapy) and beliefs about consequences (e.g., unwillingness to burden their caregiver). Theoretical domains relating to enablers included beliefs about capabilities (e.g., feeling strong), skills (e.g., practising stairs), procedural knowledge (e.g., receiving advice about early mobility) and social influences (e.g., caregivers' willingness to provide support).Multiple factors, such as feeling unsafe and caregivers' willingness to provide support, may influence implementation of home-based care from the perspectives of privately insured patients and caregivers. Our findings provide insights to inform design of suitable home-based care following joint replacement in a private setting."
https://openalex.org/W3184157600,"We study the wealth distribution of UK households through a detailed analysis of data from wealth surveys and rich lists, and propose a non-linear Kesten process to model the dynamics of household wealth. The main features of our model are that we focus on wealth growth and disregard exchange, and that the rate of return on wealth is increasing with wealth. The linear case with wealth-independent return rate has been well studied, leading to a log-normal wealth distribution in the long time limit which is essentially independent of initial conditions. We find through theoretical analysis and simulations that the non-linearity in our model leads to more realistic power-law tails, and can explain an apparent two-tailed structure in the empirical wealth distribution of the UK and other countries. Other realistic features of our model include an increase in inequality over time, and a stronger dependence on initial conditions compared to linear models."
https://openalex.org/W4221160415,"The aging world population requires a sustainable and high-quality healthcare system. To examine the efficiency of medical cooperation, medical provider and physician networks were constructed using patient claims data. Previous studies have shown that these networks contain information on medical cooperation. However, the usage patterns of multiple medical providers in a series of medical services have not been considered. In addition, these studies used only general network features to represent medical cooperation, but their expressive ability was low. To overcome these limitations, we analyzed the medical provider network to examine its overall contribution to the quality of healthcare provided by cooperation between medical providers in a series of medical services. This study focused on: i) the method of feature extraction from the network, ii) incorporation of the usage pattern of medical providers, and iii) expressive ability of the statistical model. Femoral neck fractures were selected as the target disease. To build the medical provider networks, we analyzed the patient claims data from a single prefecture in Japan between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. We considered four types of models. Models 1 and 2 use node strength and linear regression, with Model 2 also incorporating patient age as an input. Models 3 and 4 use feature representation by node2vec with linear regression and regression tree ensemble, a machine learning method. The results showed that medical providers with higher levels of cooperation reduce the duration of hospital stay. The overall contribution of the medical cooperation to the duration of hospital stay extracted from the medical provider network using node2vec is approximately 20%, which is approximately 20 times higher than the model using strength."

The proposed method is a good alternative to the existing tests of discordancy for detecting outliers in spherical data. In addition, the new method can be generalized to identify a patch of outliers in the data. We obtain the cut-off points and investigate the performance of the test statistic via simulation. The proposed test performs well in detecting a single and a patch of outliers in spherical data. As an illustration, we apply the method on an eye data set."
https://openalex.org/W4293084500,"All mammals are to different degrees exposed to stressors being physical or social, which may affect health and well-being. Stressful and traumatic situations have direct effects on immune responses that may alter susceptibility to developing somatic illnesses. In animal research, different types of stressors have been investigated in studying the effect on bowel disorders, some stressors being more or less of environmental origin. We aimed, therefore, to explore whether a more natural stressor would differ from a stressor of more unnatural characteristics on dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) induced colitis in adult rats. Specifically, whether social stress within a single social defeat (SD) paradigm would be a more potent stressor than brief inescapable foot-shocks (IFS) in causing elevated faecal granulocyte marker protein (GMP), and crypt- and inflammation scores in colonic tissue. Three groups of male Wistar rats were used; socially defeated rats; inescapable foot-shock rats; and comparison rats. Main findings showed no difference between the groups on GMP levels. However, there was a significant difference on inflammation and crypt scores for the distal part of colon, detected through histology, where socially defeated rats were more susceptible. A single SD seems to be more adverse than inescapable foot-shock on DSS induced colitis, but further studies are recommended to validate a broader range of different outcomes comparing two such different rodent stress models."
https://openalex.org/W4293102504,"In this study, the performance of bench-scale EDR was evaluated using the samples taken from the 1st and the 2nd stage RO from the Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis (BWRO) plant in Eshtehard, Iran. The measurements indicated that original TDS of the aquifer brackish water was equal to 3,229–3,664 mg/L, whereas TDS of the 1 st stage RO brine was between 5,500 and 7,700 mg/L, that TDS of the 2 nd stage RO brine was in the range of 9,500–10,600 mg/L. A batch bench-scale EDR system of 12 l/h was used with a direct electric current at three different scenarios. In the first, the brine was fed at 20°C (as a reference regulated point). In the second, temperature (14, 20, 26.5°C), and in the third, voltage were changed (6, 12, 18, 24 V) to investigate their influences on performance of the EDR process, while the other operational parameters (feed flow rate, recovery ratio, quality of feed brine)were kept constant. Based on the data analysis using the ANOVA and DUNCAN tests for the second and third scenarios, it was observed that the optimum TDS removal efficiency of the EDR process can be at temperature of 26.5°C and voltage of 18 V. On the other hand, the successful performance of the bench-scale EDR in reducing the 29,000 mg/L TDS and the 45,000 μmhos/cm EC of the 2 nd stage brine to 1,716 mg/L (TDS) and 2,640 μmhos/cm (EC) (at 26.5°C and 24V) could be considered as the main achievement of this research. Overall, the hybrid process RO-EDR-RO can be considered as the best technical, environmental and economical scenario for the development of Eshtehard Desalination Plant phase 2 at full scale."
https://openalex.org/W4293102772,"Protein electrophoresis (PEP) is an important tool in supporting the analytical characterization of protein status in diseases related to monoclonal components, inflammation, and antibody deficiency. Here, we developed a deep learning-based PEP classification algorithm to supplement the labor-intensive PEP interpretation and enhance inter-observer reliability.A total of 2,578 gel images and densitogram PEP images from January 2018 to July 2019 were split into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10.0%) sets. The PEP images were assessed based on six major findings (acute-phase protein, monoclonal gammopathy, polyclonal gammopathy, hypoproteinemia, nephrotic syndrome, and normal). The images underwent processing, including color-to-grayscale and histogram equalization, and were input into neural networks.Using densitogram PEP images, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for each diagnosis ranged from 0.873 to 0.989, and the accuracy for classifying all the findings ranged from 85.2% to 96.9%. For gel images, the AUROC ranged from 0.763 to 0.965, and the accuracy ranged from 82.0% to 94.5%.The deep learning algorithm demonstrated good performance in classifying PEP images. It is expected to be useful as an auxiliary tool for screening the results and helpful in environments where specialists are scarce."
https://openalex.org/W4293102789,"Museums have widely embraced virtual exhibits. However, relatively little attention is paid to how sound may create a more engaging experience for audiences. To begin addressing this lacuna, we conducted an online experiment to explore how sound influences the interest level, emotional response, and engagement of individuals who view objects within a virtual exhibit. As part of this experiment, we designed a set of different soundscapes, which we presented to participants who viewed museum objects virtually. We then asked participants to report their felt affect and level of engagement with the exhibits. Our results show that soundscapes customized to exhibited objects significantly enhance audience engagement. We also found that more engaged audience members were more likely to want to learn additional information about the object(s) they viewed and to continue viewing these objects for longer periods of time. Taken together, our findings suggest that virtual museum exhibits can improve visitor engagement through forms of customized soundscape design."
https://openalex.org/W4293103034,"A fleet of thirteen in-service global container ships continuously measured the air dose rates over the North Pacific after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS) accident. The results showed that the elevated air dose rates over the Port of Tokyo and the FDNPS emissions are significantly correlated (log(emission fluxes) = 54.98 x (air dose rates) (R = 0.95, P-value<0.01), and they are also significantly correlated with the Tsukuba deposition fluxes (log(deposition fluxes) = 0.47 + 30.98 (air dose rates) (R = 0.91, P-value<0.01). These results demonstrate the direct impact of the FDNPS emissions on the depositions of radionuclides and the air dose rates over the Port of Tokyo. Over the North Pacific, the correlation equations are log(emission fluxes) = -2.72 + 202.36 x (air dose rates over the northwestern Pacific) (R = 0.40, P-value<0.01), and log(emission fluxes) = -0.55 + 80.19 x (air dose rates over the northeastern Pacific) (R = 0.29, P-value = 0.0424). These results indicate that the resuspension of the deposited radionuclides have become a dominant source in the transport of radionuclides across the North Pacific. Model simulations show underestimated air dose rates during the periods of 22-25 March 2011 and 27-30 March 2011 indicating the lack of mechanisms, such as the resuspension of radionuclides, in the model."
https://openalex.org/W4293103079,"Background Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in Malawi. Despite the presence of a centralized institution supplying blood and blood products for hospitals across the country, a lack of timely blood transfusion has been identified as a critical barrier to successful PPH management. This study aims to understand the factors that affect the blood delivery pipeline and adequate access to blood products for postpartum haemorrhage patients. Methods Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders across the blood delivery pipeline. Interviews were conducted from July 2020 to January 2021 at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and Mulanje District Hospital, a referral and district hospital respectively, as well as the Malawi Blood Transfusion Service. Line by line, open coding was used to perform a thematic analysis of the data using Nvivo and Atlas.ti software. Results Five key themes were identified: 1) Lack of blood availability due to an inadequate donor pool, 2) Transportation of blood products and PPH patients is impeded by distance to target sites and competing interests for blood delivery vehicles, 3) The Malawi Blood Transfusion Service has difficulty meeting demand for blood products due to inadequate funding and difficulty retaining blood donors, 4) Current PPH management protocols and practices lead to delays due to inconsistent guidelines on delivery and analysis of patient samples, and 5) Communication between health cadres is inconsistent and affected by a lack of adequate resources. Conclusions Barriers to timely blood transfusion for PPH patients exist across the blood delivery pipeline. While an investment of infrastructure would alleviate many obstacles, several solutions identified in this study can be implemented without additional resources, such as establishing joint department meetings to improve communication between health cadres. Ultimately, given a resource limited setting, it may be worth considering de-centralizing the blood supply."
https://openalex.org/W4293103628,"The COVID-19 pandemic has infected hundreds of millions of people resulting in millions of deaths worldwide. While N95 respirators remain the gold standard as personal protective equipment, they are resource-intensive to produce and obtain. Surgical masks, easier to produce and obtain, filter ≥95% submicron particles but are less protective due to a lack of seal around a user's face. This study tested the ability of a simple surgical mask modification using rubber bands to create a seal against particle exposure that would pass N95 standards.Forty healthcare workers underwent TSI PortaCount mask fit testing using an ASTM Level 1 surgical mask modified with rubber bands. Fit Factor was determined after testing four standard OSHA N95 fit testing scenarios. Performance of the properly-modified surgical mask was compared to that of a poorly-modified surgical mask, an unmodified standard surgical mask, and an N95 respirator. Thirty-one of forty (78%) healthcare workers passed Fit Factor testing using a properly-modified mask. The Fit Factor success rate significantly improved by subsequent test date (p = 0.043), but was not associated with any other participant characteristics. The average Fit Factor score for the properly-modified mask was 151 (SD 65.2), a significantly better fit than the unmodified mask score of 3.8 (SD 3.1, p<0.001) and the poorly-modified mask score of 24.6 (SD 48.4, p<0.001) but significantly lower than a properly fitted N95 score of 199 (SD 4.5, p<0.001).do.Rubber bands, a low-cost and easily-accessible modification, can improve the seal and protective ability of a standard surgical mask to the level of an N95 respirator. This could mitigate N95 respirator shortages worldwide and provide individuals in under-resourced regions a practical means for increased personal respiratory protection."

Study design A register-based study follow-up study. Methods A nationwide study of individuals 25 years of age and older (N = 5 464 245; 2 627 364 men and 2 836 881 women) in Sweden. Hearing impairment was defined as at least one registered diagnosis in the National Patient Register between January 1 st , 1998 and December 31 st , 2015. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk (hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) of incident hearing impairment in foreign-born compared to Swedish-born individuals. Cox regression models were stratified by sex and adjusted for age, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status. Results A total of 244 171 cases (124 349 men and 119 822 women) of hearing impairment were registered. Hearing impairment risk expressed as fully adjusted HRs (99% CI) was somewhat lower among immigrant men 0.95 (0.92–97) but not among immigrant women 0.97 (0.95–1.00), with significantly higher fully adjusted HRs among men and women from Asia, and Eastern Europe, and women from Africa. Conclusions We observed a somewhat lower risk of hearing impairment among foreign-born men, but there was a higher risk among men and women from some regions."
https://openalex.org/W4293104508,"Objectives There are a few reports of TB disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Thailand. The authors assessed the demographic data and incidence of overall TB disease including specific profession among HCWs in order to reduce the incidence rate. Methods This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 195 HCWs at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH), Bangkok, Thailand, who had TB disease from 2003–2020. Results The average incidence of TB disease in HCWs at KCMH was 164 per 100,000 HCWs with 95% confidential interval [CI], 107 to 220; (94.4% had pulmonary TB). Most of the HCWs were from a young age group (43.08% were 20–29 years old) and the duration of work was short (58.82% had worked at KCMH for less than 5 years). Radiological technicians had the highest incidence of TB, followed by supportive teams, scientists, and physicians (429, 241, 205, and 193 per 100,000 HCWs according to their profession, respectively). Seventy five percent of TB disease was found in physicians who worked at KCMH within 2 years. TB incidence was highest among residents (688 per 100,000 residents) in a subgroup of physicians. Conclusions The incidence of TB disease in HCWs was close to the general population of Thailand (153 per 100,000 population with 95% CI, 116 to 195). A higher incidence was observed in the profession that had contact with TB patients and their specimens. A high proportion of asymptomatic HCWs also had TB disease and TB incidence was found in a new generation of HCWs who have worked for less than 5 years. More rigorous epidemiology investigations are needed to establish a definitive relation to subsequently developing TB after working in a hospital. The authors suggest active surveillance in all new incoming HCWs and TB preventive therapy should also be provided to recent converters."

Systematic sampling of every other patient (K = 2.7) was employed to interview 371 participants. A previously validated tool was used to collect data through a face-to-face interview. A path analysis was used to fit the structural model and tests the hypothesized Health Belief Model (HBM) relationships.Response rate was 95.4% (354). Around 52% of the participants were male and 76.8% follow diabetic education at least some times. 42.4% and 48% of respondents have good dietary and general self-care practices respectively.

Methods This mixed-method study consists of a quantitative questionnaire and focus groups. Quantitative data were analysed by calculating the descriptive statistics, and interviews were analysed using Mayring’s content analysis. Results A total of 170 medical students completed the questionnaire, and 59 students participated in 9 focus groups. Students reported that they felt more confident dealing with vaccination-critical parents after learning the new teaching concept. Similar results were found for medical students prior to and during the pandemic. During the pandemic, medical students viewed vaccinations for several diseases, such as measles or COVID-19, as important (range: M = 3.56, SD = 0.54 to M = 3.97, SD = 0.17). Similar results were found for medical students prior to the pandemic (range: M = 3.26, SD = 0.77 to M = 3.94, SD = 0.24). In the focus groups, however, medical students displayed controversial attitudes regarding compulsory vaccinations. Conclusions While the medical students agreed on the use of vaccination for highly infectious diseases, their level of agreement decreased depending on the severity of the disease. Practical recommendations that come out of the study are creating a trustful relationship with and delivering information to patients."
https://openalex.org/W4293104917,"Background In pregnancies obtained by in-vitro fertilization (IVF) the exact day of conception is known. For that reason, IVF pregnancies are currently dated according to the day of oocytes retrieval and consequent embryo transfer. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the knowledge of the exact day of conception in IVF pregnancies is a sufficient argument against dating these pregnancies by first trimester ultrasound measurement of the crown-rump length (CRL), as it is recommended in natural conceptions. Methods A r etrospective study was performed, including all women with singleton pregnancies conceived by IVF who underwent the first-trimester ultrasound scan for the screening of aneuploidies between January 2014 and June 2019. For each pregnancy GA was determined using two alternative methods: one based on the date of embryo transfer (GA IVF ), and one based on ultrasound measurement of CRL (GA US ). GA were compared to search for any discrepancy. The impact of pregnancy dating on obstetric outcome was evaluated. Results Overall, 249 women were included. Comparing GA US and GA IVF , a median difference of 1 [0 – 2] days emerged (p&lt;0.001), with GA US being in advance compared to GA IVF . This discrepancy persisted when subgroups were analyzed comparing different IVF procedures (conventional IVF versus ICSI, cleavage versus blastocyst transfer, frozen versus fresh transfer). No impact of the dating method on obstetric outcomes was observed, being no differences in the rate of preterm birth or abnormal fetal growth. Conclusions In IVF pregnancies GA US and GA IVF are not overlapping, since GA US is mildly greater than GA IVF . This could be due to an anticipated ovulation and fertilization in IVF pregnancy, rather than an accelerated embryo development. For that reason, it would be appropriate to date IVF pregnancies according to GA US , despite a known date of conception, to re-align IVF pregnancies to natural ones."
https://openalex.org/W4293105165,"Large cellular antigens comprise a variety of different epitopes leading to a T cell response of extreme diversity. Therefore, tracking such a response by next generation sequencing of the T cell receptor (TCR) in order to identify common TCR properties among the expanding T cells represents an enormous challenge. In the present study we adapted a set of established indices to elucidate alterations in the TCR repertoire regarding sequence similarities between TCRs including VJ segment usage and diversity of nucleotide coding of a single TCR. We combined the usage of these indices with a new systematic splitting strategy regarding the copy number of the extracted clones to divide the repertoire into multiple fractions for separate analysis. We implemented this new analytic approach using the splenic TCR repertoire following immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in mice. As expected, early after immunization presumably antigen-specific clones accumulated in high copy number fractions, but at later time points similar accumulation of specific clones occurred within the repertoire fractions of lowest copy number. For both repertoire regions immunized animals could reliably be distinguished from control in a classification approach, demonstrating the robustness of the two effects at the individual level. The direction in which the indices shifted after immunization revealed that for both the early and the late effect alterations in repertoire parameters were caused by antigen-specific private clones displacing non-specific public clones. Taken together, tracking antigen-specific clones by their displacement of average TCR repertoire characteristics in standardized repertoire fractions ensures that our analytical approach is fairly independent from the antigen in question and thus allows the in-depth characterization of a variety of immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W4293105518,"Critical infrastructure networks are vital for a functioning society and their failure can have widespread consequences. Decision-making for critical infrastructure resilience can suffer based on several characteristics exhibited by these networks, including (i) that there exist interdependencies with other networks, (ii) that several decision-makers represent potentially competing interests among the interdependent networks, and (iii) that information about other decision-makers’ actions are uncertain and potentially unknown. To address these concerns, we propose an adaptive algorithm using machine learning to integrate predictions about other decision-makers’ behavior into an interdependent network restoration planning problem considering an imperfect information sharing environment. We examined our algorithm against the optimal solution for various types, sizes, and dependencies of networks, resulting in insignificant differences. To assess the proposed algorithm’s efficiency, we compared its results with a proposed heuristic method that prioritizes, and schedules components restoration based on centrality-based importance measures. The proposed algorithm provides a solution sufficiently close to the optimal solution showing the algorithm performs well in situations where the information sharing environment is incomplete."
https://openalex.org/W4293105584,"Background Proteinuria results from kidney damage and can be a predictor of illness severity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the optimal timing of proteinuria measurements and the reference values remain undetermined. Our objective was to identify the patterns of proteinuria change associated with mortality in ICU patients with sepsis or shock. Methods This monocentric retrospective cohort study performed from April 2010 to April 2018 involved all ICU patients with sepsis or shock and at least two measurements of proteinuria from a 24h-urine collection during the first 10 days of ICU stay, the first of which was made within 48h after ICU admission. We identified proteinuria trajectories by a semi-parametric mixture model and analysed the association between the trajectories and the mortality at day 28 by Cox proportional-hazards model. Results A total of 3,344 measurements of proteinuria from 659 patients were analysed. Four proteinuria trajectories were identified. Trajectories 1, 2, 3 and 4 comprised 127, 421, 60 and 51 patients, and were characterized by a first proteinuria of 1.14 [0.66–1.55], 0.52 [0.26–0.91], 2.92 [2.38–3.84] and 2.58 [1.75–3.32] g/24h (p&lt;0.001) and a mortality of 24.4%, 38%, 20% and 43% (p = 0.002), respectively. Trajectories 3 and 4 had a high first proteinuria (&gt;2g/24h). Only, the proteinuria of trajectory 4 increased within 3 days following the first measurement and was associated with increased mortality at day 28 (hazard ratio: 2.36 95%CI [1.07–5.19], p = 0.03), regardless of acute renal failure. The factors associated with trajectory 4 were cancer (relative risk: 8.91 95%CI [2.09–38.02], p = 0.003) and use of inotropic drugs (relative risk: 0.17 95%CI [0.04–0.69], p = 0.01). Conclusion This exploratory study of ICU patients with sepsis or shock identified four proteinuria trajectories with distinct patterns of proteinuria change over time and mortality rates. These results provide novel insights into renal pathophysiology and may be helpful to investigate subphenotypes of kidney injury among ICU patients in future studies."
