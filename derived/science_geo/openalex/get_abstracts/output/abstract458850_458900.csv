https://openalex.org/W2084198524,"Structurally and sequence-wise, the Hsp110s belong to a subfamily of the Hsp70 chaperones. Like the classical Hsp70s, members of the Hsp110 subfamily can bind misfolding polypeptides and hydrolyze ATP. However, they apparently act as a mere subordinate nucleotide exchange factors, regulating the ability of Hsp70 to hydrolyze ATP and convert stable protein aggregates into native proteins. Using stably misfolded and aggregated polypeptides as substrates in optimized in vitro chaperone assays, we show that the human cytosolic Hsp110s (HSPH1 and HSPH2) are bona fide chaperones on their own that collaborate with Hsp40 (DNAJA1 and DNAJB1) to hydrolyze ATP and unfold and thus convert stable misfolded polypeptides into natively refolded proteins. Moreover, equimolar Hsp70 (HSPA1A) and Hsp110 (HSPH1) formed a powerful molecular machinery that optimally reactivated stable luciferase aggregates in an ATP- and DNAJA1-dependent manner, in a disaggregation mechanism whereby the two paralogous chaperones alternatively activate the release of bound unfolded polypeptide substrates from one another, leading to native protein refolding."
https://openalex.org/W1970090414,"To report the feasibility, efficacy, and toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and/or inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis (IVCTT) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Forty-one patients treated with SBRT using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for HCC with PVTT/IVCTT between July 2010 and May 2012 were analyzed. Of these, 33 had PVTT and 8 had IVCTT. SBRT was designed to target the tumor thrombosis and deliver a median total dose of 36 Gy (range, 30-48 Gy) in six fractions during two weeks.The median follow-up was 10.0 months. At the time of analysis, 15 (36.6%) achieved complete response, 16 (39.0%) achieved partial response, 7 (17.1%) patients were stable, and three (7.3%) patients showed progressive disease. No treatment-related Grade 4/5 toxicity was seen within three months after SBRT. One patient had Grade 3 elevation of bilirubin. The one-year overall survival rate was 50.3%, with a median survival of 13.0 months. The only independent predictive factor associated with better survival was response to radiotherapy.VMAT-based SBRT is a safe and effective treatment option for PVTT/IVCTT in HCC. Prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate the role of SBRT in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2074351284,"Mesophotic coral reefs (30–150 m) have recently received increased attention as a potential source of larvae (e.g., the refugia hypothesis) to repopulate a select subset of the shallow water (<30 m) coral fauna. To test the refugia hypothesis we used highly polymorphic Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers as a means to assess small-scale genetic heterogeneity between geographic locations and across depth clines in the Caribbean coral, Montastraea cavernosa. Zooxanthellae-free DNA extracts of coral samples (N = 105) were analyzed from four depths, shallow (3–10 m), medium (15–25 m), deep (30–50 m) and very deep (60–90 m) from Little Cayman Island (LCI), Lee Stocking Island (LSI), Bahamas and San Salvador (SS), Bahamas which range in distance from 170 to 1,600 km apart. Using AMOVA analysis there were significant differences in ΦST values in pair wise comparisons between LCI and LSI. Among depths at LCI, there was significant genetic differentiation between shallow and medium versus deep and very deep depths in contrast there were no significant differences in ΦST values among depths at LSI. The assignment program AFLPOP, however, correctly assigned 95.7% of the LCI and LSI samples to the depths from which they were collected, differentiating among populations as little as 10 to 20 m in depth from one another. Discriminant function analysis of the data showed significant differentiation among samples when categorized by collection site as well as collection depth. FST outlier analyses identified 2 loci under positive selection and 3 under balancing selection at LCI. At LSI 2 loci were identified, both showing balancing selection. This data shows that adult populations of M. cavernosa separated by depths of tens of meters exhibits significant genetic structure, indicative of low population connectivity among and within sites and are not supplying successful recruits to adjacent coral reefs less than 30 m in depth."
https://openalex.org/W1965723377,"CAP (adenylyl cyclase-associated protein) was first identified in yeast as a protein that regulates both the actin cytoskeleton and the Ras/cAMP pathway. Although the role in Ras signaling does not extend beyond yeast, evidence supports that CAP regulates the actin cytoskeleton in all eukaryotes including mammals. In vitro actin polymerization assays show that both mammalian and yeast CAP homologues facilitate cofilin-driven actin filament turnover. We generated HeLa cells with stable CAP1 knockdown using RNA interference. Depletion of CAP1 led to larger cell size and remarkably developed lamellipodia as well as accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin). Moreover, we found that CAP1 depletion also led to changes in cofilin phosphorylation and localization as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and enhanced cell spreading. CAP1 forms complexes with the adhesion molecules FAK and Talin, which likely underlie the cell adhesion phenotypes through inside-out activation of integrin signaling. CAP1-depleted HeLa cells also had substantially elevated cell motility as well as invasion through Matrigel. In summary, in addition to generating in vitro and in vivo evidence further establishing the role of mammalian CAP1 in actin dynamics, we identified a novel cellular function for CAP1 in regulating cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2068405904,"Ursolic acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic acid distributed in medical herbs, exerts antitumor effects and is emerging as a promising compound for cancer prevention and therapy, but its excise mechanisms of action in colon cancer cells remains largely unknown. Here, we identified the molecular mechanisms by which UA inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human colon cancer SW480 and LoVo cells. Treatment with UA led to significant inhibitions in cell viability and clone formation and changes in cell morphology and spreading. UA also suppressed colon cancer cell migration by inhibiting MMP9 and upregulating CDH1 expression. Further studies showed that UA inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK proteins. Pretreatment with an Akt or ERK-specific inhibitor considerably abrogated the proliferation inhibition by UA. UA also significantly inhibited colon cancer cell COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Pretreatment with a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) abrogated the UA-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that UA effectively promoted NF-κB and p300 translocation from cell nuclei to cytoplasm, and attenuated the p300-mediated acetylation of NF-κB and CREB2. Pretreatment with a p300 inhibitor (roscovitine) abrogated the UA-induced cell proliferation, which is reversed by p300 overexpression. Furthermore, UA treatment induced colon cancer cell apoptosis, increased the cleavage of PARP, caspase-3 and 9, and trigged the release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial inter-membrane space into cytosol. These results indicate that UA inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells through simultaneous modulation of the multiple signaling pathways such as MMP9/CDH1, Akt/ERK, COX-2/PGE2, p300/NF-κB/CREB2, and cytochrome c/caspase pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1996651322,"Background Pyropia haitanensis and P. yezoensis are two economically important marine crops that are also considered to be research models to study the physiological ecology of intertidal seaweed communities, evolutionary biology of plastids, and the origins of sexual reproduction. This plastid genome information will facilitate study of breeding, population genetics and phylogenetics. Principal Findings We have fully sequenced using next-generation sequencing the circular plastid genomes of P. hatanensis (195,597 bp) and P. yezoensis (191,975 bp), the largest of all the plastid genomes of the red lineage sequenced to date. Organization and gene contents of the two plastids were similar, with 211–213 protein-coding genes (including 29–31 unknown-function ORFs), 37 tRNA genes, and 6 ribosomal RNA genes, suggesting a largest coding capacity in the red lineage. In each genome, 14 protein genes overlapped and no interrupted genes were found, indicating a high degree of genomic condensation. Pyropia maintain an ancient gene content and conserved gene clusters in their plastid genomes, containing nearly complete repertoires of the plastid genes known in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Similarity analysis based on the whole plastid genome sequences showed the distance between P. haitanensis and P. yezoensis (0.146) was much smaller than that of Porphyra purpurea and P. haitanensis (0.250), and P. yezoensis (0.251); this supports re-grouping the two species in a resurrected genus Pyropia while maintaining P. purpurea in genus Porphyra. Phylogenetic analysis supports a sister relationship between Bangiophyceae and Florideophyceae, though precise phylogenetic relationships between multicellular red alage and chromists were not fully resolved. Conclusions These results indicate that Pyropia have compact plastid genomes. Large coding capacity and long intergenic regions contribute to the size of the largest plastid genomes reported for the red lineage. Possessing the largest coding capacity and ancient gene content yet found reveal that Pyropia are more primitive multicellular red algae."
https://openalex.org/W2083049407,"Sphingolipids are structural components of membranes, and sphingolipid metabolites serve as signaling molecules. The first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The recently discovered SPT-associated proteins, Orm1 and Orm2, are critical regulators of sphingolipids. Orm protein phosphorylation mediating feedback regulation of SPT activity occurs in response to multiple sphingolipid intermediates, including long chain base and complex sphingolipids. Both branches of the TOR signaling network, TORC1 and TORC2, participate in regulating sphingolipid synthesis via Orm phosphorylation in response to sphingolipid intermediates as well as nutritional conditions. Moreover, sphingolipid synthesis is regulated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by activation of a calcium- and calcineurin-dependent pathway via transcriptional induction of ORM2. Conversely, the calcium- and calcineurin-dependent pathway signals ER stress response upon lipid dysregulation in the absence of the Orm proteins to restore ER homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2076344021,"Although most eggs are intensely predated, the aerial egg clutches from the aquatic snail Pomacea canaliculata have only one reported predator due to unparalleled biochemical defenses. These include two storage-proteins: ovorubin that provides a conspicuous (presumably warning) coloration and has antinutritive and antidigestive properties, and PcPV2 a neurotoxin with lethal effect on rodents. We sequenced PcPV2 and studied whether it was able to withstand the gastrointestinal environment and reach circulation of a potential predator. Capacity to resist digestion was assayed using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence spectroscopy and simulated gastrointestinal proteolysis. PcPV2 oligomer is antinutritive, withstanding proteinase digestion and displaying structural stability between pH 4.0–10.0. cDNA sequencing and protein domain search showed that its two subunits share homology with membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF)-like toxins and tachylectin-like lectins, a previously unknown structure that resembles plant Type-2 ribosome-inactivating proteins and bacterial botulinum toxins. The protomer has therefore a novel AB toxin combination of a MACPF-like chain linked by disulfide bonds to a lectin-like chain, indicating a delivery system for the former. This was further supported by observing PcPV2 binding to glycocalix of enterocytes in vivo and in culture, and by its hemaggutinating, but not hemolytic activity, which suggested an interaction with surface oligosaccharides. PcPV2 is able to get into predator’s body as evidenced in rats and mice by the presence of circulating antibodies in response to sublethal oral doses. To our knowledge, a lectin-pore-forming toxin has not been reported before, providing the first evidence of a neurotoxic lectin in animals, and a novel function for ancient and widely distributed proteins. The acquisition of this unique neurotoxic/antinutritive/storage protein may confer the eggs a survival advantage, opening new perspectives in the study of the evolution of animal defensive strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2027555230,"Usher syndrome (USH) is a leading cause of deaf-blindness in autosomal recessive trait. Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneities in USH make molecular diagnosis much difficult. This is a pilot study aiming to develop an approach based on next-generation sequencing to determine the genetic defects in patients with USH or allied diseases precisely and effectively. Eight affected patients and twelve unaffected relatives from five unrelated Chinese USH families, including 2 pseudo-dominant ones, were recruited. A total of 144 known genes of inherited retinal diseases were selected for deep exome resequencing. Through systematic data analysis using established bioinformatics pipeline and segregation analysis, a number of genetic variants were released. Eleven mutations, eight of them were novel, in the USH2A gene were identified. Biparental mutations in USH2A were revealed in 2 families with pseudo-dominant inheritance. A proband was found to have triple mutations, two of them were supposed to locate in the same chromosome. In conclusion, this study revealed the genetic defects in the USH2A gene and demonstrated the robustness of targeted exome sequencing to precisely and rapidly determine genetic defects. The methodology provides a reliable strategy for routine gene diagnosis of USH."

Extensive baseline profiling of recruited patients was undertaken to identify gender-specific differences for risk delineation.We screened 2,438 patients with AF and recruited 335 into SAFETY. Of these, 48.1% were women who were, on average, 5 years older than their male counterparts. Women and men displayed divergent antecedent profiles, with women having a higher thrombo-embolic risk but being prescribed similar treatment regimens. More women than men presented to hospital with co-morbid thyroid dysfunction, depression, renal impairment and obesity. In contrast, more men presented with coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Even when data was age-adjusted, women were more likely to live alone (odds ratio [OR] 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47 to 3.69), have non-tertiary education (OR 2.69; 95% CI 1.61 to 4.48) and be symptomatic (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.06 to 3.52).Health care providers should be cognisant of gender-specific differences in an attempt to individualise and, hence, optimise the management of patients with chronic AF and reduce potential morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2050403306,"The aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) has been shown as a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) since 2006. While evidence has suggested that mutation or truncation in TDP-43 influences its aggregation process, nevertheless, the correlation between the TDP-43 aggregation propensity and its binding substrates has not been fully established in TDP-43 proteinopathy. To address this question, we have established a platform based on the in vitro protein expression system to evaluate the solubility change of TDP-43 in response to factors such as nucleotide binding and temperature. Our results suggest that the solubility of TDP-43 is largely influenced by its cognate single-strand DNA (ssDNA) or RNA (ssRNA) rather than hnRNP, which is known to associate with TDP-43 C-terminus. The direct interaction between the refolded TDP-43, purified from E.coli, and ssDNA were further characterized by Circular Dichroism (CD) as well as turbidity and filter binding assay. In addition, ssDNA or ssRNA failed to prevent the aggregation of the F147L/F149L double mutant or truncated TDP-43 (TDP208–414). Consistently, these two mutants form aggregates, in contrast with the wild-type TDP-43, when expressed in Neuro2a cells. Our results demonstrate an intimate relationship between the solubility of TDP-43 and its DNA or RNA binding affinity, which may shed light on the role of TDP-43 in ALS and FTLD."
https://openalex.org/W2138960524,"The aim of the study was to establish an optimized protocol of iron dextran administration to pig neonates, which better meets the iron demand for erythropoiesis. Here, we monitored development of red blood cell indices, plasma iron parameters during a 28-day period after birth (till the weaning), following intramuscular administration of different concentrations of iron dextran to suckling piglets. To better assess the iron status we developed a novel mass spectrometry assay to quantify pig plasma levels of the iron-regulatory peptide hormone hepcidin-25. This hormone is predominantly secreted by the liver and acts as a negative regulator of iron absorption and reutilization. The routinely used protocol with high amount of iron resulted in the recovery of piglets from iron deficiency but also in strongly elevated plasma hepcidin-25 levels. A similar protocol with reduced amounts of iron improved hematological status of piglets to the same level while plasma hepcidin-25 levels remained low. These data show that plasma hepcidin-25 levels can guide optimal dosing of iron treatment and pave the way for mixed supplementation of piglets starting with intramuscular injection of iron dextran followed by dietary supplementation, which could be efficient under condition of very low plasma hepcidin-25 level."

To assess the gene product's biological role more directly, a Staphylococcus aureus strain with an inactivated hemQ gene was generated and shown to be a slow growing small colony variant under aerobic but not anaerobic conditions. The small colony variant phenotype is rescued by the addition of exogenous heme despite an otherwise wild type heme biosynthetic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2044021900,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has multiple functions in embryogenesis, adult homeostasis, tissue repair, and development of cancer. Here, we report that TGF-β suppresses the transcriptional activation of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene, which is implicated in protection against oxidative injury and lung carcinogenesis. HO-1 is a target of the oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor Nrf2. TGF-β did not affect the stabilization or nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 after stimulation with electrophiles. Instead, TGF-β induced expression of transcription factors MafK and Bach1. Enhanced expression of either MafK or Bach1 was enough to suppress the electrophile-inducible expression of HO-1 even in the presence of accumulated Nrf2 in the nucleus. Knockdown of MafK and Bach1 by siRNA abolished TGF-β-dependent suppression of HO-1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Nrf2 substitutes for Bach1 at the antioxidant response elements (E1 and E2), which are responsible for the induction of HO-1 in response to oxidative stress. On the other hand, pretreatment with TGF-β suppressed binding of Nrf2 to both E1 and E2 but marginally increased the binding of MafK to E2 together with Smads. As TGF-β is activated after tissue injury and in the process of cancer development, these findings suggest a novel mechanism by which damaged tissue becomes vulnerable to oxidative stress and xenobiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1996378042,"Biofilms constitute the predominant form of microbial life and a potent reservoir for innate antibiotic resistance in systemic infections. In the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the transition from a planktonic to sessile state is mediated by mutually exclusive regulatory pathways controlling the expression of genes required for flagellum or biofilm formation. Here, we identify mstX and yugO as novel regulators of biofilm formation in B. subtilis. We show that expression of mstX and the downstream putative K+ efflux channel, yugO, is necessary for biofilm development in B. subtilis, and that overexpression of mstX induces biofilm assembly. Transcription of the mstX-yugO operon is under the negative regulation of SinR, a transcription factor that governs the switch between planktonic and sessile states. Furthermore, mstX regulates the activity of Spo0A through a positive autoregulatory loop involving KinC, a histidine kinase that is activated by potassium leakage. The addition of potassium abrogated mstX-mediated biofilm formation. Our findings expand the role of Spo0A and potassium homeostasis in the regulation of bacterial development."

Recent reports demonstrate novel functions of complement in normal and diseased CNS, such as regulation of neurogenesis and synapse elimination. Here, we examined the role of complement-derived peptide C3a in unilateral hypoxia-ischemia (HI), a model of neonatal HI encephalopathy. HI injury was induced at postnatal day 9 (P9), and loss of hippocampal tissue was determined on P31. We compared WT mice with transgenic mice expressing C3a under the control of glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, which express biologically active C3a only in CNS and without the requirement of a priori complement activation. Further, we injected C3a peptide into the lateral cerebral ventricle of mice lacking the C3a receptor (C3aR) and WT mice and assessed HI-induced memory impairment 41 d later. We found that HI-induced tissue loss in C3a overexpressing mice was reduced by 50% compared with WT mice. C3a peptide injected 1 h after HI protected WT but not C3aR-deficient mice against HI-induced memory impairment. Thus, C3a acting through its canonical receptor ameliorates behavioral deficits after HI injury, and C3aR is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of neonatal HI encephalopathy."

Here, luciferase reporter assays showed that an endoplasmic reticulum stress element (ERSE)-like element, CCAAT-N26-CCACG in the human PRNP promoter, is regulated by ER stress and X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) but not by activating transcription factor 6 α (ATF6α). Bioinformatics identified the ERSE-26 motif in 37 other human genes in the absence of canonical ERSE sites except for three genes. Several of these genes are associated with a synaptic function or are involved in oxidative stress. Brefeldin A, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin ER stressors induced gene expression of PRNP and four randomly chosen ERSE-26-containing genes, ERLEC1, GADD45B, SESN2, and SLC38A5, in primary human neuron cultures or in the breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell line, although the level of the response depends on the gene analyzed, the genetic background of the cells, the cell type, and the ER stressor. Overexpression of XBP1 increased, whereas siRNA knockdown of XBP1 considerably reduced, PRNP and ERLEC1 mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, these results identify a novel ER stress regulator, which implicates the ER stress response in previously unrecognized cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2169482634,"Although Tau accumulation is a feature of several neurodegenerative conditions, treatment options for these conditions are nonexistent.

Neuronal protective effects and decreased PHF-1 immunoreactivity were observed in two animal models, 3×Tg-AD and CK-p25. Treatment nearly eliminated Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau with the most prominent effect on the phosphorylation at Ser-404. Treatment also induced the recovery of memory in a fear conditioning assay.

NMNAT1 binds to nucleomethylin and is recruited into a ternary complex containing the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SirT1. NMNAT1 expression stimulates the deacetylase function of SirT1. Knockdown of NMNAT1 enhances rRNA transcription and promotes cell death after nutrient deprivation. Furthermore, NMNAT1 expression is induced by DNA damage and plays a role in preventing cell death after damage. Heterozygous deletion of NMNAT1 in lung tumor cell lines correlates with low expression level and increased sensitivity to DNA damage. These results suggest that NMNAT1 deletion in tumors may contribute to transformation by increasing rRNA synthesis, but may also increase sensitivity to nutrient stress and DNA damage.Background: NMNAT1 catalyzes the last step in NAD+ synthesis.Results: NMNAT1 is recruited into a complex containing SirT1 and regulates rRNA transcription.Conclusion: NMNAT1 participates in the regulation of rRNA biosynthesis, possibly by producing a local supply of NAD+.Significance: NMNAT1 may be regulated by recruitment into complexes that consume NAD+.

NMNAT1 binds to nucleomethylin and is recruited into a ternary complex containing the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SirT1. NMNAT1 expression stimulates the deacetylase function of SirT1. Knockdown of NMNAT1 enhances rRNA transcription and promotes cell death after nutrient deprivation. Furthermore, NMNAT1 expression is induced by DNA damage and plays a role in preventing cell death after damage. Heterozygous deletion of NMNAT1 in lung tumor cell lines correlates with low expression level and increased sensitivity to DNA damage. These results suggest that NMNAT1 deletion in tumors may contribute to transformation by increasing rRNA synthesis, but may also increase sensitivity to nutrient stress and DNA damage. Background: NMNAT1 catalyzes the last step in NAD+ synthesis. Results: NMNAT1 is recruited into a complex containing SirT1 and regulates rRNA transcription. Conclusion: NMNAT1 participates in the regulation of rRNA biosynthesis, possibly by producing a local supply of NAD+. Significance: NMNAT1 may be regulated by recruitment into complexes that consume NAD+. Frequent heterozygous deletion of NMNAT1 may contribute to tumor development. Ribosome biogenesis is a major biosynthetic and energy-consuming process. Ribosomal RNA synthesis accounts for >50% of cellular transcriptional activity and must be tightly coupled to nutrient availability and growth signaling (1.Mayer C. Grummt I. Ribosome biogenesis and cell growth: mTOR coordinates transcription by all three classes of nuclear RNA polymerases.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6384-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Production of rRNA by RNA polymerase I is a rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis. Numerous growth and stress signals converge on regulating polymerase I activity and rRNA transcription (2.Zhai W. Comai L.

Human tumor suppressor p14ARF negatively regulates rRNA transcription and inhibits UBF1 transcription factor phosphorylation.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). rRNA transcription is controlled by altering the transcription rate per gene and changing the fraction of ∼200 rRNA genes that are in the active state. Nearly 50% of rDNA repeats are present as heterochromatin in growing cells (5.Grummt I. Pikaard C.S. Epigenetic silencing of RNA polymerase I transcription.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the heterochromatin state is important for maintaining stability of the rDNA repeats. Deletion of Sir2 in yeast leads to formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles toxic to the cell (6.Blander G. Guarente L. The Sir2 family of protein deacetylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the nucleolar remodeling complex is important for switching rDNA between silent and active states. The nucleolar remodeling complex is a sucrose nonfermentation 2 homolog-containing chromatin remodeling complex that recruits DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase to the promoter to trigger heterochromatin formation and silencing (7.Santoro R. Li J. Grummt I. The nucleolar remodeling complex NoRC mediates heterochromatin formation and silencing of ribosomal gene transcription.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A recent study identified the energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex (eNoSC) 2The abbreviations used are: eNoSCenergy-dependent nucleolar silencing complexIPimmunoprecipitationNAMnicotinamideNMLnucleomethylinNMNAT1nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferasePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseH3K9me2dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9NAMPTnicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. that regulates rRNA transcription in response to glucose deprivation (8.Murayama A.

The eNoSC contains a novel nucleolar protein nucleomethylin (NML), SirT1, and SUV39H1 (8.Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M.

Knockdown of NML prevents the down-regulation of rRNA synthesis by glucose starvation, resulting in ATP depletion and apoptosis. NML represses rDNA transcription by promoting H3K9 methylation and establishing heterochromatin across the rDNA. NML has an N-terminal half that binds H3K9me2 and a C-terminal domain homologous to S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase (8.Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K.

Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT1), which is the subject of this report due to its co-purification with NML, catalyzes NAD+ synthesis in the last step of a salvage synthesis pathway that recycles nicotinamide (NAM) back to NAD+ (9.Zhang T.

NMNAT1 has gained recent attention due to its ability to delay neuronal degeneration induced by injury. NMNAT1 is part of the fusion protein in the Wallerian degeneration slow (wlds) mice that delays axonal degeneration after experimental transsection (13.Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J.

Recently, point mutations that reduce the enzymatic activity of NMNAT1 have been identified in the inherited form of retinal degeneration Leber congenital amaurosis (16.Chiang P.W. Wang J. Chen Y.

Genet. 2012; 44: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NMNAT1 is also unique in being the only nuclear protein in the gene family (NMNAT2/3 are localized in the Golgi and mitochondria) (20.Berger F. Lau C. Dahlmann M. Ziegler M. Subcellular compartmentation and differential catalytic properties of the three human nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36334-36341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), suggesting that it has important functions in regulating processes in the nucleus. Very little is known about the regulation of NMNAT1. NMNAT1 interacts with PARP, and the binding is regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NMNAT1 (21.Berger F. Lau C. Ziegler M. Regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 activity by the phosphorylation state of the nuclear NAD biosynthetic enzyme NMN adenylyltransferase 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3765-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because PARP is the major NAD+ consumer during DNA damage response, NMNAT1 binding may serve to provide NAD+ in close proximity to facilitate poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis. NMNAT1 has also been shown to bind SirT1 (22.Zhang T. Berrocal J.G. Frizzell K.M. Gamble M.J. DuMond M.E. Krishnakumar R. Yang T. Sauve A.A. Kraus W.L. Enzymes in the NAD+ salvage pathway regulate SIRT1 activity at target gene promoters.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20408-20417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that NMNAT1 can serve as a molecular chaperone, inhibits aggregation of polyglutamine proteins, and provides neuronal protection in Drosophila independent of NAD+ synthesis (23.Zhai R.G. Zhang F. Hiesinger P.R. Cao Y. Haueter C.M. Bellen H.J. NAD synthase NMNAT acts as a chaperone to protect against neurodegeneration.Nature. 2008; 452: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NMNAT1 expression is inducible by heat shock, hypoxia, and oxidative stress in Drosophila (24.Ali Y.O. McCormack R. Darr A. Zhai R.G. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase is a stress response protein regulated by the heat shock factor/hypoxia-inducible factor 1α pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19089-19099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we described results showing that NMNAT1 is recruited to the nucleolar transcriptional repressor complex eNoSC by NML. NMNAT1 knockdown stimulates rRNA transcription. The NMNAT1 level is significantly induced after DNA damage, suggesting that NMNAT1 provides a signaling pathway between stress and SirT1-dependent gene regulation. NMNAT1 is located in a chromosomal region frequently deleted in cancer. NMNAT1 expression level is significantly reduced in a subset of lung tumor cell lines, suggesting that reduced NMNAT1 level may provide an advantage during tumor development. NMNAT1 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR and cloning from a human cell line. NML plasmid was provided by Dr. Junn Yanagisawa. All constructs used in this study are of human origin. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. For glucose starvation treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS before culturing in DMEM with 10% dialyzed FBS and 0 mm or 25 mm glucose. Transfection of H1299 cells was performed using standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. U2OS cells with stable expression of NMNAT1 were generated by infection with pLenti-NMNAT1 virus followed by Zeocin selection (ViraPower T-REX lentiviral expression system; Invitrogen). ATP concentration was determined using a commercial kit (BioVision). Cells were transfected with 50 nm control siRNA (AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU), NMNAT1 siRNA1 (GCAGAACUUGCUACCAAGAAUUCUA), and NMNAT1 siRNA2 (GGAAGGAAGAGGAAGUGGACUGAAA) (Invitrogen), NML siRNA pool (Dharmacon), or DBC1 siRNA pool (Dharmacon) using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to instructions from the supplier. Cells were washed with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then scraped into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and clarified by centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies. Anti-NMNAT1 mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal serum for NML was immunized using His6-NML-(1–200). Anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Myc polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling. Anti-SirT1 monoclonal antibody 10E4 was purchased from Millipore. Anti-PARP1 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Cells were washed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove the insoluble debris. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Cell lysate (200–1000 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with specific antibody and protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) or anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 18 h at 4 °C. Bacterial lysates expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-NML were applied to glutathione-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The beads loaded with GST fusion proteins were incubated with recombinant His6-tagged NMNAT1 protein at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and detected by Western blotting. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were prepared by reverse transcription of total RNA using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen). The primers used for SYBR Green quantitative PCR of human pre-rRNA, NMNAT1, NML, and GAPDH mRNA were as follows: human pre-rRNA forward, 5′-GAACGGTGGTGTGTCGTTC and reverse, 5′-GCGTCTCGTCTCGTCTCACT; NMNAT1 forward, 5′-TCTCCTTGCTTGTGGTTCATTC and reverse, 5′-TGACAACTGTGTACCTTCCTGT; NML forward, 5′-CCCCAGCCTATGTATAAGTGACT and reverse, 5′-GAGCCTGTTTGTGGCATTTCT; GAPDH forward, 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT and reverse, 5′-GACAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAG. ChIP assay was performed using standard procedures. NMNAT1 complex was immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody (exogenous) or NMNAT1 antibody (endogenous). SirT1 complex was immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody (exogenous) or 10E4 antibody (endogenous). Samples were subjected to SYBR Green real-time PCR analysis using primers for rDNA promoter H0 5′-GGTATATCTTTCGCTCCGAG and 5′-GACGACAGGTCGCCAGAGGA. The concentrations of NAD+/NADH in whole cell extracts were determined using a NAD+/NADH Quantification Kit (BioVision) according to instructions from the supplier. Genomic DNA was prepared from lung tumor cell lines according to the established protocol. The NMNAT1 quantitative PCR data were normalized to interspersed repetitive element LINE1. The primers used for NMNAT1 were 5′-GGCATCATCTCTCCTGTTGGT and 5′-TTTCCCATGTATCAACTTCCACC. The primers for LINE1 were 5′-CAGAATCTCTGGGACGCATT and 5′-ATTGTGATGTTCGGGTGTCA (based on GenBank entry X52235.1). HeLa cells treated with control siRNA, NMNAT1, or NML siRNA were labeled with 5 μCi of [3H]uridine (38 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min and washed twice with PBS. RNA was extracted with an RNeasy mini kit. For quantification of rRNA synthesis level, an identical amount of total RNA was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to determine the incorporation of [3H]uridine. Recent studies identified NML as a novel H3K9me2-binding nucleolar protein that inhibits rRNA transcription through recruitment of SirT1 to the rDNA repeats (8.Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M. Nagata K. Fukamizu A. Kimura K. Shimizu T. Yanagisawa J. Epigenetic control of rDNA loci in response to intracellular energy status.Cell. 2008; 133: 627-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To determine whether NML interacts with other factors to regulate rRNA transcription, we performed affinity purification of FLAG-NML after transient expression in H1299 cells. Consistent with NML being a nucleolar protein, several ribosomal proteins were co-purified with NML. Also identified in the NML complex was NMNAT1, which is the last enzyme in the NAD+ salvage synthesis pathway (Fig. 1a). To confirm the interaction between NMNAT1 and NML, recombinant His6-tagged NMNAT1 and GST-NML were purified from Escherichia coli (Fig. 1b, left panel) and tested for binding in vitro. His6-NMNAT1 was pulled down by beads loaded with GST-NML, but not by GST (Fig. 1b, right panel), suggesting that the two proteins interact directly. Next, we performed co-IP assays using epitope-tagged NMNAT1 and NML. When H1299 cells were co-transfected with Myc-NMNAT1 and FLAG-NML, specific co-precipitation between exogenous NMNAT1 and NML was detected using either FLAG or Myc IP (Fig. 1, c and d). In the same assay, NMNAT1 did not co-precipitate with the SirT1-binding protein DBC1 (Fig. 1c), suggesting that the interaction with NML was specific. The detection of endogenous NMNAT1 and NML binding by co-IP/Western blotting was inconclusive due to lack of suitable antibody. Therefore, we generated tetracycline-inducible Myc-NMNAT1 expressing U2OS cells. In the absence of tetracycline induction, the cell line expressed Myc-NMNAT1 at a basal level similar to endogenous NMNAT1. IP of the basal Myc-NMNAT1 clearly co-precipitated endogenous NML (Fig. 1e, third lane). As expected, after tetracycline induction of high level Myc-NMNAT1, more endogenous NML was co-precipitated by Myc IP (Fig. 1e, fourth lane). Endogenous NMNAT1 also co-precipitated significantly with Myc-NMNAT1 in the Myc IP (Fig. 1e, third panel, third lane), suggesting that NMNAT1 forms dimer or oligomers in the cell. This is consistent with previous finding that recombinant NMNAT crystallized as a dimer (25.Garavaglia S. D'Angelo I. Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Pierella F. Magni G. Rizzi M. Structure of human NMN adenylyltransferase: a key nuclear enzyme for NAD homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NMNAT1 is a specific binding partner of NML. Previous study showed that NML recruits the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SirT1 to form the eNoSC that represses rRNA transcription. The identification of NMNAT1 as an NML-binding protein suggests that it may be recruited by NML into the eNoSC and stimulate SirT1 function by producing NAD+ locally. To test whether NML promotes interaction of NMNAT1 and SirT1, a co-transfection and IP-Western blot assay was performed to detect Myc-NMNAT1 with endogenous SirT1. Previous work showed that SirT1 binding to NML was stimulated by glucose deprivation (8.Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M. Nagata K. Fukamizu A. Kimura K. Shimizu T. Yanagisawa J. Epigenetic control of rDNA loci in response to intracellular energy status.Cell. 2008; 133: 627-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We found that expression of NML resulted in significant SirT1-NMNAT1 co-precipitation after glucose deprivation, correlating with NML-SirT1 binding (Fig. 2a). Therefore, NML can promote complex formation between SirT1 and NMNAT1. Immunofluorescence staining of Myc-NMNAT1 confirmed the notion that NMNAT1 is localized in the nucleus (data not shown). To test whether a fraction of NMNAT1 was recruited to the nucleolus by NML, we performed ChIP against NMNAT1 and analyzed the binding to rDNA by PCR. The result showed that co-transfection of NML and NMNAT1 stimulated the binding of NMNAT1 to rDNA, which was further enhanced by glucose starvation (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, endogenous NMNAT1 in nontransfected cells also showed moderately increased binding to rDNA after glucose starvation (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that NML is capable of recruiting NMNAT1 to the nucleolus. SirT1-mediated deacetylation reaction consumes NAD+ and produces nicotinamide. NMNAT1 catalyzes the last reaction in recycling nicotinamide back to NAD+. Although NAMPT is thought to be the rate-limiting step in NAD+ salvage synthesis reaction based on in vitro enzyme kinetics analysis (10.Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S. The NAD biosynthesis pathway mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase regulates Sir2 activity in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50754-50763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), it is possible that the level of NMNAT1 in the nucleus is important under in vivo conditions. We tested the effect of NMNAT1 level on SirT1 deacetylase function in cells using p53 as a substrate. The level of p53 acetylation on Lys-382 was monitored after co-transfection with p300 in H1299 cells. Expression of NMNAT1 stimulated the ability of SirT1 to deacetylate p53 (Fig. 3a), suggesting that nuclear NMNAT1 level has an impact on SirT1 activity. To further test the effect of endogenous NMNAT1 in p53 acetylation level, U2OS cells were treated with NMNAT1 siRNA in combination with DNA damage. NMNAT1 knockdown stimulated p53 acetylation level before and after DNA damage with doxorubicin (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the level of NMNAT1 was important for regulating SirT1 activity in vivo. In the co-transfection assay, addition of NML did not further promote p53 deacetylation by SirT1 and NMNAT1 (data not shown). Therefore the assay was not informative for testing the role of NML-mediated SirT1-NMNAT1 complex formation, possibly because the weak binding of SirT1 and NMNAT1 was already sufficient for the p53 deacetylation reaction outside the nucleolus. NML is a suppressor of rRNA transcription. Loss of NML expression dampens the down-regulation of rRNA transcription during glucose starvation (8.Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M. Nagata K. Fukamizu A. Kimura K. Shimizu T. Yanagisawa J. Epigenetic control of rDNA loci in response to intracellular energy status.Cell. 2008; 133: 627-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The interaction between NML and NMNAT1 suggests that NMNAT1 may be involved in the repression of rRNA transcription. We found that knockdown of NMNAT1 (Fig. 3c) led to increased rRNA synthesis as measured by [3H]UTP incorporation assay (Fig. 3d) or RT-PCR detection of pre-rRNA (Fig. 3e). NMNAT1 knockdown also partially prevented the down-regulation of rRNA synthesis after glucose starvation (Fig. 3d). The effect was similar to knockdown of NML. Ribosomal RNA transcription accounts for >50% of cellular transcription activity and consumes a significant amount of energy. Failure to down-regulate rRNA synthesis during starvation has been shown to cause ATP depletion and cell death (8.Murayama A. Ohmori K. Fujimura A. Minami H. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Kuroda T. Oie S. Daitoku H. Okuwaki M. Nagata K. Fukamizu A. Kimura K. Shimizu T. Yanagisawa J. Epigenetic control of rDNA loci in response to intracellular energy status.Cell. 2008; 133: 627-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). NMNAT1 knockdown also accelerated the depletion of cellular ATP level during glucose starvation (Fig. 4c). As expected, NMNAT1 knockdown increased the level of cell death after glucose starvation, similar to NML knockdown (Fig. 4, a and b). Depletion of the SirT1 inhibitor DBC1 did not cause cell death, as expected from the protective effect of SirT1 activation. These results suggest that NMNAT1 participates in regulating rRNA transcription and is necessary for the proper control of ribosome biogenesis during nutrient deprivation. Ribosomal RNA transcription is repressed after DNA damage. We found that DNA damage by doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 5a) or γ-irradiation (Fig. 5b) caused an increase in NMNAT1 protein level. RT-PCR analysis showed that doxorubicin induced NMNAT1 mRNA expression by 5-fold (Fig. 5c). Several other stress treatments that inhibit rRNA transcription (actinomycin D), inhibit mTOR (rapamycin), or activate p53 (Nutlin) did not significantly affect NMNAT1 expression. NMNAT1 induction by doxorubicin was observed in multiple tumor cell lines, independent of p53 status (Fig. 5d). To test whether NMNAT1 induction is a protective response to DNA damage, U2OS cells were treated with NMNAT1 siRNA in combination with doxorubicin. The combination treatment caused more cell death than doxorubicin alone (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, the levels of DNA damage markers γH2AX and phosphorylated p53 (pSer15) were elevated after γ-irradiation and down-regulated less efficiently at late time points, suggesting a delayed repair of DNA damage (Fig. 5f). This effect may be mediated by NMNAT1 stimulation of PARP, which is a major NAD+-consuming enzyme after DNA damage. Our results showed that NMNAT1 is also a DNA damage-responsive gene, suggesting that NMNAT1 plays a role in cellular response to multiple types of stress signals. Ribosomal rRNA transcription is significantly increased in tumors. Therefore, alteration of NMNAT1 expression during tumor development may facilitate rRNA transcription and cell growth and confer a selective advantage unde"

To learn whether heart disease causes an onset of AD, mice with myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (HF) were used to test neuropsychiatric and cognitive behaviors as well as for measurements of AD related protein markers. To this end, adult mice were subjected to ligation of left anterior descending artery (LAD) and about two weeks later high-frequency echocardiography was performed to exam the resulting cardiac structure and function. Three months after successful induction of chronic heart failure (CHF) these mice showed an impairment of learning in the Morris Water Maze task. In addition, the expression of selected molecules, which are involved in β-amyloid metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation on the level of gene transcription and translation, was altered in CHF mice. Our findings provide a plausible explanation that CHF increases the risk of cognitive impairments and alters cerebral β-amyloid metabolism. In addition, our data indicate that the cerebral compensatory mechanisms in response to CHF are brain area and gender specific."

In a previous study, we found men and women to be differentially sensitive to small differences in infant facial cuteness, with reproductive hormone status as the potential underlying cause. It is unclear, however, whether reproductive hormone status impacts on the aesthetic and incentive salience of infant faces. To address this question, we conducted two interlinked studies. We used static images of the same smiling and neutral-looking infant faces in both a rating task, in which participants had to rate the cuteness of infant faces (aesthetic salience - ‘liking’), and a key-press task, in which participants could prolong or shorten viewing time of infant faces by rapid alternating key-presses (incentive salience - ‘wanting’). In a first study, we compared the performance of men, women who are taking oral contraceptives, and regularly cycling women. In this study, we found a significant correlation between cuteness ratings within and between groups, which implies that participants had the same concept of cuteness. Cuteness ratings and effort to look at faces was linked regardless of sex and reproductive hormone status, in that cute faces were looked at for longer than less cute faces. A happy facial expression contributed only marginally to the incentive salience of the face. To explore the potential impact of reproductive hormone status in more detail, we followed a subset of regularly cycling women during the menstrual, follicular and luteal phases of their cycle. The aesthetic and incentive salience of infant faces did not change across the menstrual cycle. Our findings suggest that reproductive hormone status does not modulate the aesthetic and incentive value of infant faces."

Biochemical analysis revealed that these mice had markedly reduced levels and activity of PDE6 prior to degeneration (17.Ramamurthy V. Niemi G.A. Reh T.A. Hurley J.B.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13897-13902Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The drastic reduction in PDE6 was specific, as the levels of other main photoreceptor proteins remained unaffected (17.Ramamurthy V. Niemi G.A. Reh T.A. Hurley J.B.

Rod PDE6 is a heterotetramer composed of two homologous catalytic subunits (PDE6AB) and two copies of an inhibitory (Pγ) subunit (20.Cote R.H. Characteristics of photoreceptor PDE (PDE6): similarities and differences to PDE5.Int. J. Impot. Res. 2004; 16: S28-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Light stimulates phototransduction by activating PDE6AB to hydrolyze a second messenger cGMP and close cGMP-gated channels in the photoreceptor plasma membrane (19.Arshavsky V.Y. Burns M.E.

Mutations in PDE6AB are known to cause retinal degeneration in humans and animal models by elevating intracellular cGMP concentration and triggering photoreceptor cell death (21.Farber D.B.

Sci. 1999; 40: 1859-1865PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, defective PDE6 function due to mutations in AIPL1 readily explains LCA4. However, the mechanism of AIPL1 action remains poorly understood. Evidence suggests that AIPL1 acts on rod PDE6 posttranslationally and stabilizes the enzyme by preventing its misassembly that leads to rapid protein degradation (26.Kolandaivelu S. Huang J. Hurley J.B. Ramamurthy V. AIPL1, a protein associated with childhood blindness, interacts with α-subunit of rod phosphodiesterase (PDE6) and is essential for its proper assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30853-30861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proper assembly of PDE6 requires correct folding and prenylation of PDE6A and PDE6B, formation of the catalytic heterodimer PDE6AB, and its association with the Pγ-subunits. PDE6A and PDE6B are farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, respectively (27.Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H.Y. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K.

AIPL1 appears to bind to the PDE6A subunit (26.Kolandaivelu S. Huang J. Hurley J.B. Ramamurthy V. AIPL1, a protein associated with childhood blindness, interacts with α-subunit of rod phosphodiesterase (PDE6) and is essential for its proper assembly.J. Biol.

Roberts M. van den Akker F. Niemi G. Reh T.A. Hurley J.B. AIPL1, a protein implicated in Leber's congenital amaurosis, interacts with and aids in processing of farnesylated proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12630-12635Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen indicated that AIPL1 interacts specifically with farnesylated retinal proteins (28.Ramamurthy V. Roberts M. van den Akker F. Niemi G. Reh T.A. Hurley J.B. AIPL1, a protein implicated in Leber's congenital amaurosis, interacts with and aids in processing of farnesylated proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12630-12635Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Yet, other farnesylated proteins, except PDE6, were unaffected in mouse retina lacking AIPL1 (17.Ramamurthy V. Niemi G.A. Reh T.A. Hurley J.B. Leber congenital amaurosis linked to AIPL1: a mouse model reveals destabilization of cGMP phosphodiesterase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13897-13902Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether AIPL1 can directly bind the farnesyl moiety, and we examined the possibility that LCA-linked mutations in AIPL1 may disrupt this interaction. To aid our studies, we analyzed the structure of AIPL1 in solution by SAXS and generated a molecular model of AIPL1 most consistent with the scattering data. Our analysis demonstrated high affinity binding of the farnesylated-Cys probe to the FKBP-like domain of AIPL1, thereby revealing a novel function of this domain. Furthermore, an LCA4-causing mutation C89R was found to abrogate the probe binding, suggesting an essential role for the farnesyl-mediated PDE6A interaction in normal function of AIPL1. AMCA, SE was purchased from Invitrogen. S-Farnesyl-l-cysteine methyl ester was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. All other chemicals were acquired from Sigma. DNA sequences coding the full-length AIPL1, the N-terminal domain (residues 1–161), or the C-terminal domain (residues 162–328) were PCR-amplified from mouse retinal cDNA and cloned into the pET15b vector using NdeI/BamHI sites. Mutations were introduced using standard QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol. The AIPL1Δ96–143 mutant was generated by replacing the residues 96–143 of AIPL1WT with two glycine residues in a two-step PCR procedure. In the first step, the AIPL1(1–95)Gly-Gly(144–155) sequence was amplified with a forward primer containing the start codon and an NdeI site and a reverse primer corresponding to AIPL1(84–95)Gly-Gly(144–155). This PCR product was used as a forward primer in the second PCR amplification with a primer containing the stop codon and a BamHI site. This resulting PCR product was then cloned into the pET15b vector using NdeI/BamHI sites. The His6-tagged AIPL1 proteins were expressed in BL21-codon plus Escherichia coli cells by induction with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight. Cell pellets were sonicated on ice (five 30-s pulses) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm l-arginine, 50 mm l-glutamic acid, 10% glycerol, 15 mm DTT (buffer A), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The His6-tagged AIPL1 proteins were purified over Ni-NTA resin (Novagen) using buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole for elution. Ni-NTA affinity-purified AIPL1 proteins were used in fluorescence binding assays directly or after additional purification by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q5 column (Bio-Rad). For analysis of the structure of AIPL1 in solution by SAXS, the His6-AIPL1 protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl 200 column. Dynamic light scattering was used to examine the degree of monodispersity of AIPL1 samples. Purified AIPL1 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm l-arginine, 50 mm l-glutamic acid, and 10 mm DTT (buffer B). Analyses of monodispersity of dialyzed AIPL1 samples (4 mg/ml) were performed at 22 °C using a DynaPro Nanostar instrument (Wyatt). The data were analyzed using the Dynamics 7.1.7 software. A homology model of the N-terminal FKBP-type domain of AIPL1 (residues 1–157) was generated with Modeler 9.11 (29.Sali A. Blundell T.L.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10539) Google Scholar) using the solution NMR structure of AIP FKBP-like domain as the template (PDB ID code 2LKN) (30.Linnert M. Lin Y.J. Manns A.

The C-terminal TPR domain of AIPL1 (residues 171–328) was modeled with the hm_build macro in Yasara 12.11.25 (31.Krieger E. Koraimann G. Vriend G. Increasing the precision of comparative models with YASARA NOVA: a self-parameterizing force field.Proteins. 2002; 47: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) that used a number of high resolution TPR domain structures in the PDB to generate an optimized model. These domain models were then superimposed on the respective FKBP and TPR domains from the FKBP52 crystal structure (PDB ID code 1P5Q) (32.Wu B. Li P. Liu Y. Lou Z. Ding Y. Shu C. Ye S. Bartlam M.

The resulting model with missing domain linker and the N-terminal tag was completed and refined against the SAXS data to generate the molecular model of AIPL1 as described below. SAXS analysis was performed to determine the low resolution solution structure of AIPL1. SAXS data on the His6-tagged AIPL1 protein were collected at the Advanced Light Source (12.3.1 SIBYLS beamline) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. Three different concentrations of AIPL1 (2.4, 1.6, and 0.8 mg/ml in buffer B) were exposed to the synchrotron radiation for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 s each. Scattering from the buffer (matched against the samples by overnight dialysis) was subtracted and the sample scattering data analyzed by Primus/QT (33.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.

AutoRg and AutoDmax were used to calculate the Rg (radius of gyration) and Dmax (maximum particle dimension from a pairwise distribution function) in Primus/QT, and ab inito envelopes were generated using the GASBOR (34.Svergun D.I.

The AIPL1 homology model described above was used in the program BUNCH (40.Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I.

The two domains were treated as rigid bodies whereas the connecting linker (residues 158–170) and the N-terminal 22 residue tag/linker were modeled as flexible dummy residues that together best fit the SAXS data. During fitting, the two domains could move independently of each other restrained by the length of the interdomain linker. The ab initio envelopes generated separately were aligned to the best-fit BUNCH model using supcomb13 (41.Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. Automated matching of high- and low-resolution structural models.J.

Conjugation of AMCA-X to cysteine farnesyl methyl ester was performed at 25 °C for 1 h using, respectively, 6 mm and 2 mm solutions of the reagents in 25% acetonitrile, 25% dimethylformamide, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). The product, farnesyl-Cys-AMCA, was purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Cys-AMCA was prepared by reacting 1 mm AMCA-X with 3 mm cysteine in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50% acetonitrile for 30 min at 25 °C. Fluorescence assays were performed on a F-2500 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Hitachi) in 1 ml of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) or 100 mm PBS (pH 7.5). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay of farnesyl-Cys-AMCA binding to AIPL1 or mutants was performed with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 440 nm. Farnesyl-Cys-AMCA (150–250 nm) served as an acceptor of AIPL1 Trp fluorescence. The data were fit with equation for binding with ligand depletion, F=((Fmax−F0)/Bm)×0.5×(Bm+Kd+X−(−Bm−Kd−X)2−4×Bm×X)(Eq.1) where F0 is a basal fluorescence of farnesyl-Cys-AMCA, F is the fluorescence after additions of binding protein, Fmax is the maximal fluorescence change, Bm is a concentration of farnesyl-Cys-AMCA, and X is a concentration of added protein. Concentrations of farnesyl-Cys-AMCA and AIPL1 were determined using ϵ350 = 19,000 and ϵ280 = 55,000 m−1cm−1, respectively. Fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using Prism software (GraphPad). The Kd values are expressed as mean ± S.E. for at least three independent measurements. CD analysis was performed to verify the folding and secondary structure of AIPL1 mutants.

Crabs were exposed to Cd that resulted in Cd accumulation and a significant increase in the metallothionein (MT) level in the gill, but MT level increased disproportionally compared to the Cd accumulation with an extension of exposure time. Significant changes in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were observed. An increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) was detected that will cause oxidative stress. Histological abnormalities of the gills were discovered, including the expansion of gill cavity, a decrease in the numbers of connection of the upper and the lower of the gill lamellae and epithelial cells, and an increase in the number of hemocytes. The results of a TUNEL test and transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that more gill cells had apoptotic characteristics after 48 h of Cd treatment compared to the control, but epithelial cell necrosis and inflammatory response appeared only after 72 h. It was concluded that (1) Cd induced the ROS production and accumulation through inhibiting antioxidant enzyme activities and exceeding the saturation values of MT binging; (2) Cd led to lipid peroxidation and histopathological alternations; and (3) Cd induced apoptotic response at short time exposure, followed by necrotic features and inflammatory reaction after longer time exposure."

The cps loci of 11A and 11D differ by one codon (N112S) in wcrL, which putatively encodes a glycosyltransferase that adds the fourth sugar of the CPS repeating unit (RU). Gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that 11A and 11D PSs contain identical CPS RUs that contain αGlc as the fourth sugar.

Intermolecular recognition by peptides is a critical aspect of regulatory processes at cellular interfaces (1.Rose A. Meier I.

Native systems ranging from viral fusion proteins (2.Boucrot E. Pick A. Çamdere G. Liska N. Evergren E. McMahon H.T. Kozlov M.M.

Scheller R.H. Mechanisms of synaptic vesicle exocytosis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2331-2343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and harbor domains of enteric pathogens (5.Knodler L.A. Ibarra J.A. Pérez-Rueda E. Yip C.K. Steele-Mortimer O. Coiled-coil domains enhance the membrane association of Salmonella type III effectors.Cell Microbiol. 2011; 13: 1497-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) rely on specific α-helical coiled coils to maintain interfacial contacts in a highly cooperative manner. Amphipathic helical monomers can be designed to incorporate alternative interfaces into such assemblies, thereby disrupting regulatory processes (6.Naider F. Anglister J. Peptides in the treatment of AIDS.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By contrast, amphipathic antimicrobial helices bind to microbial membranes without a priori requirements for specific assemblies (7.Fjell C.D. Hiss J.A. Hancock R.E. Schneider G. Designing antimicrobial peptides: form follows function.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 37-51Crossref Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Given their sequence similarities with coiled coils, antimicrobial peptides may be challenged by co-assembly with antagonistic helices, a proposition that has so far been unexplored. Thus, the overall aim of this study is to explore the hypothesis that antimicrobial activity in peptides can be effectively neutralized by the formation of inert coiled-coil complexes. Coiled-coil sequences show heptad repeats of hydrophobic and polar residues (usually designated abcdefg), in which a and d form hydrophobic interfaces (8.Grigoryan G. Keating A.E. Structural specificity in coiled-coil interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To form contiguous interfaces the a/d patterns of corresponding helices must be in register, which is prevented by the average spacing of hydrophobic residues along a coiled-coil sequence being 3.5 residues. This is less than one complete turn (3.6 residues) of a monomeric α-helix (9.Lupas A.N. Gruber M. The structure of α-helical coiled coils.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). To rectify this discrepancy a/d patterns impose a slight left-handed twist enabling left-handed helix-crossing angles in the coiled-coil bundle, which permits, but does not guarantee, stable coiled coils. Further stabilization is required through complementary electrostatic interactions at e and g sites of successive heptads between partner strands (i.e. g-e′ interactions: g of one heptad and e′ of the following heptad on the other helix) (Fig. 1) (8.Grigoryan G. Keating A.E. Structural specificity in coiled-coil interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 9.Lupas A.N. Gruber M. The structure of α-helical coiled coils.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Therefore, in assigning coiled-coil patterns in antimicrobial sequences it is necessary to consider hydrophobic a/d pairs in conjunction with charged e/g pairs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; DIPEA, N,N-diisopropylethylamine; DLPC, 1,2-dilauroylphosphatidylcholine; DLPG, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol); DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-d54-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DMPG, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol); HCTU, 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate; LD, linear dichroism; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration. are cationic amphipathic structures that fold and oligomerize in anionic phospholipid membranes (7.Fjell C.D. Hiss J.A. Hancock R.E. Schneider G. Designing antimicrobial peptides: form follows function.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 37-51Crossref Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). By this convention, antagonistic sequences are anionic amphipathic helices that remain unfolded in solution and in membrane environments but fold upon binding to cationic AMPs (Fig. 1). The strength and stability of this binding depend on helical propensity and persistence length. An antimicrobial sequence can comprise up to 50 amino acid residues (7.Fjell C.D. Hiss J.A. Hancock R.E. Schneider G. Designing antimicrobial peptides: form follows function.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11: 37-51Crossref Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 10.Peschel A. Sahl H.G.

Microbiol. 2006; 4: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar; see also antimicrobial sequences database at the bbcm Web site at the University of Trieste, Italy), and most helical AMPs contain 20–35 residues which should be sufficient for coiled-coil formation (11.Rozzelle Jr., J.E. Tropsha A. Erickson B.W. Rational design of a three-heptad coiled-coil protein and comparison by molecular dynamics simulation with the GCN4 coiled coil: presence of interior three-center hydrogen bonds.Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, and importantly, native antimicrobial helices often incorporate helix-disrupting motifs to facilitate membrane insertion. Common examples include glycine zipper G(X)nG motifs, where X is any residue and n = 3–6 (12.Senes A. Engel D.E. DeGrado W.F.

For instance, bombinins prefer n = 3 as do membrane proteins that incorporate glycine zippers for transmembrane helix dimerization, whereas cecropins, defensins, and magainins tend to have variable n, a strategy also used by proteins to specify phosphate binding and domain folding (14.Simmaco M.

Both analytical and semipreparative runs used a 10–60% B gradient over 50 min at 1 ml/min and 4.5 ml/min, respectively, with detection at 230 and 220 nm. Buffer A was 5% and buffer B was 95% aqueous CH3CN, 0.1% TFA. The lipids, 1,2-dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) and 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DLPG), 75%/25% (w:w) used for liposome construction were from Avanti Polar Lipids. The lipids were weighted up, dissolved in chloroform-methanol (2:1, v:v), dried under a nitrogen stream, and placed under vacuum overnight. The resulting film was hydrated to 10 mg/ml total lipid concentration in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The suspension was then extensively vortexed, sonicated (30 °C), and extruded using a hand-held extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) (15 times, polycarbonate filter, 0.05 μm) to give a clear solution containing small unilamellar vesicles, which were analyzed (50 nm) by photon correlation spectroscopy. Vesicles were resuspended to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and were analyzed on a Zetasizer Nano (ZEN3600, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). Dynamic light scattering batch measurements were carried out in a low volume disposable cuvette at 25 °C. Hydrodynamic radii were obtained through the fitting of autocorrelation data using the manufacture's software, Dispersion Technology Software (DTS version 5.10). All CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter fitted with a Peltier temperature controller. All measurements were taken in ellipticities in millidegrees and converted to molar ellipticities ([θ], deg cm2 dmol−1) by normalizing for the concentration of peptide bonds. Aqueous peptide solutions (300 μl, at a given concentration) were prepared in filtered (0.22 μm) 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. CD spectra recorded in the presence of synthetic membranes are for lipid:peptide molar ratio of 100:1. CD titrations were performed at 20 °C by titrating anti-cBt (177.5 μm) into cBt (30 μm) to achieve anti-cBt/cBt molar ratios from 0.1 to 2. Solution-phase flow linear dichroism spectroscopy was performed on a JASCO-810 spectropolarimeter using a photo elastic modulator 1/2 wave plate, and a micro-volume quartz Couette flow cell with ∼0.25 mm annular gap and quartz capillaries (all from Kromatec Ltd.). Molecular alignment was achieved through the constant flow of the sample solution between two coaxial cylinders: a stationary quartz rod and a rotating cylindrical capillary. Linear dichroism (LD) spectra were acquired with laminar flow obtained by maintaining the rotation speed at 3000 rpm and processed by subtracting nonrotating base-line spectra. LD spectra recorded in the presence of synthetic membranes, DLPC and DLPC:DLPG (3:1), were prepared at a lipid:peptide molar ratio of 100:1 (2 mm total lipid, 20 μm peptide). All FTIR spectra were collected using a Tensor-37 series FTIR spectrophotometer with a BioATR II unit (Bruker Optics) as the sampling platform with a photovoltaic MCT detector and a Bruker Optics work station, which was equipped with OPUS software. Aqueous samples of very low volume (15 μl, 50–130 μm) were placed in a circular sampling area of radius 2 mm with a path length of 6 μm. This multireflection ATR accessory is based on a dual crystal technology, which has an upper silicon crystal and a hemispherical zinc-selenide (ZnSe) lower crystal that does not come into contact with the sample. The temperature of the sample was maintained at 20 °C by means of flow connectors to a circulating water bath. This accessory was purged continuously throughout the experiment with dry nitrogen via telescopic inserts that seals the optical path inside the spectrometer sample compartment. All FTIR spectra were collected with resolution 4 cm−1, scanner velocity 20 kHz, 256 scans, phase resolution 32, and zero filling factor 4. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments for anti-cBt and cBt peptides and their equimolar mixture were carried out at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge fitted with absorbance and interference optics. Sedimentation equilibrium curves were measured by interference optics in the 1.2-cm path length cells. 100-μl samples of 100 μm peptides, individually and as equimolar mixtures buffered to pH 7 with 20 mm potassium phosphate, were used. Buffer density was taken as 1.0007 mg/ml, and samples were equilibrated for 24 h at rotor speeds of 30,000, 37,000 and 50,000 rpm. The data were fitted using routines in Origin (Origin Lab). The average partial specific volumes for the peptides were calculated from the amino acid sequences and were 0.73 ml/mg for all samples. Measurements were obtained using a Microcal VP-isothermal titration calorimeter and a calorimetric cell (initial volume 1.46 ml) with a 260-s equilibration time and a 120-s initial delay after each addition. The titrations were performed at 20 °C with stirring until no further enthalpy changes were observed. Binding isotherms were recorded for cBt (30 μm) following the injection of anti-cBt (2 μl aliquots, 1.4 mm) into the cell. The observed heats were corrected for dilution effects by titrating peptide solutions, as appropriate, into the buffer and using the heat of last injections due to negligible differences between the first and last injections. All the data were corrected for the volume of the added titrant and analyzed by proprietary software (Microcal Origin 7) using a one-site binding model to allow for the determination of association constants (Ka), changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and enthropy (ΔS). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. DMPC-d54 and DMPG were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and used without further purification. A 3:1 (molar ratio) of DMPC:DMPG (8 mg of total lipid) was solubilized in a 2:1 mixture (v/v) of chloroform and methanol and dried under a stream of N2 gas to generate a thin film. The lipid film was subsequently rehydrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer (containing deuterium-depleted H2O and peptide) at pH 7 to a final volume of 30 μl. 1 mg/ml stock solutions of cecropin mutant and blocker peptides were prepared in deuterium-depleted HEPES buffer at pH 7 and were added to the hydrated lipid to give a final total lipid:peptide molar ratio of 25:1. In samples in which the cecropin mutant and blocker were both present, the individual stock peptide solutions were combined before being diluted and added to the lipid film for rehydration. Static ssNMR experiments were carried out on a Varian Infinityplus 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 4-mm MAS HXY probe at 30 °C. All samples were prepared with total lipid concentrations of 10 mg/ml in 20 mm pH 7 HEPES buffer. Static 2H ssNMR spectra were acquired at 76.8 MHz using a quadrupolar echo sequence with a recycle delay of 0.5 s. 200,000 scans were collected, and 2H pulse lengths of 4 μs were used. Molecular dynamics simulations of the cecropin assembly inserted in aqueous solution were performed in GROMACS (v4.5.5) using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field with 150 mm concentration of sodium and chloride molecules for charge neutralization. AMBER99SB-ILDN was chosen following testing of four force fields, and correctly reproduced phenomena were observed in the primary monomeric spectra whereas other force fields showed helical bias. Monomeric structures were simulated for 50 ns in the NPT ensemble following energy minimization, 200-ps equilibration in the NVT ensemble, and 200-ps equilibration in the NPT ensemble. The dimer structure was run for 100 ns with 200ips equilibration steps in the NVT and NPT ensembles, both with and without peptide position restraints. These extra steps allowed for relaxation of the solvent and the dimer in each ensemble. The initial helical configuration was obtained using the XPlor-NIH structure determination algorithm. In detail, the temperature was coupled using a velocity-rescaling thermostat (coupling time 0.1 ps) with separate peptide and solvent coupling groups. Pressure coupling was isotropic and achieved through a Parrinello-Rahman coupling scheme (coupling time 2.0 ps). Bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS algorithm. The TIP3P water model was used, and a time step of 2 fs was used throughout. Coulomb and van der Waals forces were treated by a twin range cut-off scheme, with short range electrostatics experiencing a cutoff of 1 nm and long range by particle-mesh Ewald with grid spacing of 0.12 nm. Pair-lists were updated every five steps. MICs were determined by broth microdilution on Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli K12, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25723, Micrococcus luteus NCIMB 13267, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Typically, 100 μl of 0.5–1 × 106 cfu/ml of each bacterium in Mueller-Hinton medium broth (Oxoid) was incubated in 96-well microtiter plates with 100 μl of serial 2-fold dilutions of the peptides (from 100 to 0 μm) at 37 °C on a three-dimensional orbital shaker. The absorbance was measured after peptide addition at 600 nm using a Victor 2 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). MICs were defined as the lowest peptide concentration after 24 h at 37 °C. All tests were done in triplicate. S. aureus (ATCC 25723) culture (1 ml) was centrifuged to give a cell pellet, which was washed twice with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, before being reconstituted in phosphate buffer to give A600 nm = 0.008. 1 ml of the solution was dispensed in a 2-well glass chamber (LabTek) with diluted (1/500) propidium iodide (1 mg/ml, from Invitrogen). The chambers with surface-settled bacteria (60 min) were mounted on a confocal microscope (Olympus) equipped with an incubation chamber at 37 °C. Propidium iodide fluorescence emission was monitored at 625 nm for 60 min (three frames/min) using an appropriate filter after the addition of peptide (1 ml). Recorded images (XYZ) were analyzed using Fiji software to plot the number of fluorescent (stain-dead) cells as a function of time. Hemolysis was determined by incubating 10% (v/v) suspension of human erythrocytes with peptides. Erythrocytes were rinsed four times in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.2, by repeated centrifugation and resuspension (3 min at 3000 × g). Erythrocytes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in either deionized water (fully hemolysed control), PBS, or with peptide in PBS. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was separated from the pellet and the absorbance measured at 550 nm. Absorbance of the suspension treated with deionized water defined complete hemolysis. The values below correspond to the percentage of hemolysis at tested concentrations. All tests were done in triplicate. 20 μl of a bacterium culture was dispensed onto a glass slide and spread well. The slide was swiftly passed through a Bunsen flame to dry and fix cells before staining. The fixed bacteria were first covered in crystal violet (0.25%) for 30 s followed by washing with water (distilled, filtered 0.22 μm) until all of the excess stain was washed off, and then with iodine (1.0%) for 2 min before washing with a minimum amount of acetone needed to rinse off the iodine color. The cells were counterstained with safranin (0.5%) for 30 s, washed with water, and dried by a Bunsen flame. The obtained slides were viewed under a Leica DMLB fluorescent microscope. The images were obtained at ×100 magnification under oil and analyzed by ImageJ. b27 consists of 27 amino acid residues with one glycine at each terminus (20.Zanetti M. Cathelicidins, multifunctional peptides of the innate immunity.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The C-terminal heptad of the peptide is predominantly hydrophobic and contains a PXXP motif, which is believed to promote membrane insertion (22.Yang S.T. Jeon J.H. Kim Y. Shin S.Y. Hahm K.S. Kim J.I. Possible role of a PXXP central hinge in the antibacterial activity and membrane interaction of PMAP-23, a member of cathelicidin family.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A larger N-terminal stretch has three incomplete coiled-coil heptads starting with a charged arginine at g followed by putative a/d and g/e patterns. An antagonist sequence, anti-b27, was designed to match these patterns in a parallel arrangement. a and d positions were occupied by core-stabilizing combinations of phenylalanine and leucine residues to favor low oligomers while promoting cooperative folding (23.Yoder N.C.

Soc. 2009; 131: 13240-13241Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Negatively charged glutamates were used in g and e positions of anti-b27 to pair corresponding g′, e′ lysines and arginines in b27. The remaining b, c, and f sites were made neutral polar and alanine residues. The PXXP motif in the antagonist was deemed redundant and was replaced to stabilize coiled-coil formation. Fig. 1A summarizes the design. Consistent with the design, the peptides did not fold individually in aqueous solutions at micromolar concentrations. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were characteristic of random coil or disordered conformations (Fig. 2A). Similarly, none of the peptides folded in the presence of zwitterionic unilamellar vesicles whose composition mimics that of mammalian membranes (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, CD spectra for equimolar peptide mixtures showed appreciable helical signals indicative of coiled-coil formation (Fig. 2A). The behavior of the peptides in anionic unilamellar vesicles, which mimicked microbial membranes, was consistent with the observations. Unlike anti-b27, which remained disordered, b27 underwent a coil-helix transition suggesting membrane binding (Fig. 2B). The helix content in both cases did not exceed 35% (supplemental Fig. S1). The percentage of α-helix was estimated using the equation: −100([θ]222 + 3000)/33,000 (26.Morrisett J.D. Jackson R.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Lipid-protein interactions in the plasma lipoproteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 472: 93-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the thermal denaturation of pair mixtures gave sigmoidal unfolding curves indicative of cooperatively folded structures (Fig. 2C). Low temperature CD and FTIR spectra recorded before and after thermal unfolding revealed almost complete reversibility of folding (supplemental Fig. S1). The first derivatives of the unfolding curves comprised several overlapping transitions with two clear cut-offs of transition midpoints (Tm) at approximately 37 °C and 70 °C, with the higher Tm becoming more pronounced at higher concentrations (Fig. 2D). The transitions were broadly within the biokinetic temperature ranges. However, the lower cut-off remained apparent at all concentrations and was dominating at lower concentrations (Fig. 2D). Although b27 was strongly antimicrobial (Table 1) the effect of the antagonist on the activity of b27 could not be measured with certainty (results not shown). Therefore, anti-b27-b27 interactions were deemed insufficiently stable under physiological conditions. The lack of stability can be attributed to that g-e′ interactions available in b27 can support the assembly of only two combined heptads, which falls short of a stable coiled coil formed by three"
https://openalex.org/W2021634495,"Recent literature suggests that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) mediate cell migration. However, the mechanisms were not known. Therefore, the objective of this study is to test whether cyclin/CDKs activate Pak1, an effector of Rac1, whose involvement in the modulation of cell migration and proliferation is well established. Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) induced Pak1 phosphorylation/activation in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in a delayed time-dependent manner. MCP1 also stimulated F-actin stress fiber formation in a delayed manner in HASMCs, as well as the migration and proliferation of these cells. Inhibition of Pak1 suppressed MCP1-induced HASMC F-actin stress fiber formation, migration, and proliferation. MCP1 induced cyclin D1 expression as well as CDK6 and CDK4 activities, and these effects were dependent on activation of NFATc1. Depletion of NFATc1, cyclin D1, CDK6, or CDK4 levels attenuated MCP1-induced Pak1 phosphorylation/activation and resulted in decreased HASMC F-actin stress fiber formation, migration, and proliferation. CDK4, which appeared to be activated downstream of CDK6, formed a complex with Pak1 in response to MCP1. MCP1 also activated Rac1 in a time-dependent manner, and depletion/inhibition of its levels/activation abrogated MCP1-induced NFATc1-cyclin D1-CDK6-CDK4-Pak1 signaling and, thereby, decreased HASMC F-actin stress fiber formation, migration, and proliferation. In addition, smooth muscle-specific deletion of NFATc1 led to decreased cyclin D1 expression and CDK6, CDK4, and Pak1 activities, resulting in reduced neointima formation in response to injury. Thus, these observations reveal that Pak1 is a downstream effector of CDK4 and Rac1-dependent, NFATc1-mediated cyclin D1 expression and CDK6 activity mediate this effect.

https://openalex.org/W1964535009,"Inhibitors of peptidases isolated from leguminous seeds have been studied for their pharmacological properties. The present study focused on purification, biochemical characterization and anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant evaluation of a novel Kunitz trypsin inhibitor from Erythrina velutina seeds (EvTI). Trypsin inhibitors were purified by ammonium sulfate (30-60%), fractionation followed by Trypsin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified inhibitor showed molecular mass of 19,210.48 Da. Furthermore, a second isoform with 19,228.16 Da was also observed. The inhibitor that showed highest trypsin specificity and enhanced recovery yield was named EvTI (P2) and was selected for further analysis. The EvTI peptide fragments, generated by trypsin and pepsin digestion, were further analyzed by MALDI-ToF-ToF mass spectrometry, allowing a partial primary structure elucidation. EvTI exhibited inhibitory activity against trypsin with IC50 of 2.2×10(-8) mol.L(-1) and constant inhibition (Ki) of 1.0×10(-8) mol.L(-1), by a non-competitive mechanism. In addition to inhibit the activity of trypsin, EvTI also inhibited factor Xa and neutrophil elastase, but do not inhibit thrombin, chymotrypsin or peptidase 3. EvTI was investigated for its anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant properties. Firstly, EvTI showed no cytotoxic effect on human peripheral blood cells. Nevertheless, the inhibitor was able to prolong the clotting time in a dose-dependent manner by using in vitro and in vivo models. Due to anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant EvTI properties, two sepsis models were here challenged. EvTI inhibited leukocyte migration and specifically acted by inhibiting TNF-α release and stimulating IFN-α and IL-12 synthesis. The data presented clearly contribute to a better understanding of the use of Kunitz inhibitors in sepsis as a bioactive agent capable of interfering in blood coagulation and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1997496112,"The study was aimed to test whether zinc supplementation, if initiated early, can prevent stunting and promote optimum body composition in full term infants. For this, full term pregnant women from low income urban community were enrolled and were followed-up for 24 months postpartum. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from maternal weight and height that were collected one month after delivery. Infants' weight, and length, head, chest and mid upper arm circumferences and skin fold thicknesses at triceps, biceps and subscapular area were collected at baseline (before randomization) and once in three months up till 24 months. Three hundred and twenty four infants were randomized and allocated to zinc (163) or placebo (161) groups respectively. Supplementation of zinc was initiated from 4 months of age and continued till children attained 18 months. The control (placebo) group of children received riboflavin 0.5 mg/day, whereas the intervention (zinc) group received 5 mg zinc plus riboflavin 0.5 mg/day. When infants were 18 months old, dietary intakes (in 78 children) were calculated by 24 hour diet recall method and hemoglobin, zinc, copper and vitamin A were quantified in blood samples collected from 70 children. The results showed prevalence of undernutrition (body mass index <18.5) in 37% of the mothers. Mean±SD calorie consumption and zinc intakes from diets in infants were 590±282.8 Kcal/day and 0.97±0.608 mg/day respectively. Multiple linear regression models demonstrated maternal weight as a strong predictor of infants' weight and length at 18 months of age. As expected, diarrhea duration impacted infants' linear growth and weight gain adversely. Zinc supplementation for a mean period of 190 days, starting from 4 months up to 18 months of age, in full term normal infants, consuming an average energy of 590 Kcal/day, had significant effect on the skin fold thicknesses, but not on their linear growth.

https://openalex.org/W2019360134,"Aim Early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa), which is a clinically heterogeneous-multifocal disease, is essential to improve the prognosis of patients. However, published PCa diagnostic markers share little overlap and are poorly validated using independent data. Therefore, we here developed an integrative proteomics and interaction network-based classifier by combining the differential protein expression with topological features of human protein interaction networks to enhance the ability of PCa diagnosis. Methods and Results By two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with MS using PCa and adjacent benign tissues of prostate, a total of 60 proteins with the differential expression in PCa tissues were identified as the candidate markers. Then, their networks were analyzed by GeneGO Meta-Core software and three hub proteins (PTEN, SFPQ and HDAC1) were chosen. After that, a PCa diagnostic classifier was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) modeling based on the microarray gene expression data of the genes which encode the hub proteins mentioned above. Validations of diagnostic performance showed that this classifier had high predictive accuracy (85.96∼90.18%) and area under ROC curve (approximating 1.0). Furthermore, the clinical significance of PTEN, SFPQ and HDAC1 proteins in PCa was validated by both ELISA and immunohistochemistry analyses. More interestingly, PTEN protein was identified as an independent prognostic marker for biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa patients according to the multivariate analysis by Cox Regression. Conclusions Our data indicated that the integrative proteomics and interaction network-based classifier which combines the differential protein expression and topological features of human protein interaction network may be a powerful tool for the diagnosis of PCa. We also identified PTEN protein as a novel prognostic marker for biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa patients."
https://openalex.org/W2019039014,"The family Oscarellidae is one of the two families in the class Homoscleromorpha (phylum Porifera) and is characterized by the absence of a skeleton and the presence of a specific mitochondrial gene, tatC. This family currently encompasses sponges in two genera: Oscarella with 17 described species and Pseudocorticium with one described species. Although sponges in this group are relatively well-studied, phylogenetic relationships among members of Oscarellidae and the validity of genus Pseudocorticium remain open questions. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of Oscarellidae using four markers (18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, atp6, tatC), and argue that it should become a mono-generic family, with Pseudocorticium being synonymized with Oscarella, and with the transfer of Pseudocorticium jarrei to Oscarella jarrei. We show that the genus Oscarella can be subdivided into four clades, each of which is supported by either a small number of morphological characters or by molecular synapomorphies. In addition, we describe two new species of Oscarella from Norwegian fjords: O. bergenensis sp. nov. and O. nicolae sp. nov., and we compare their morphology, anatomy, and cytology with other species in this genus. Internal anatomical characters are similar in both species, but details of external morphology and particularly of cytological characters provide diagnostic features. Our study also confirms that O. lobularis and O. tuberculata are two distinct polychromic sibling species. This study highlights the difficulties of species identification in skeleton-less sponges and, more generally, in groups where morphological characters are scarce. Adopting a multi-marker approach is thus highly suitable for these groups."
https://openalex.org/W2052025064,"It is established that proplatelets are formed from mature megakaryocytes (MK) as intermediates before platelet production. Recently, the presence of proplatelets was described in blood incubated in static conditions. We have previously demonstrated that platelet and proplatelet formation is upregulated by MK exposure to high shear rates (1800 s(-1)) on immobilized von Willebrand factor (VWF). The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether VWF is involved in the regulation of terminal platelet production in blood. To this end, Vwf (-/-) mice, a model of severe von Willebrand disease, were used to create a situation in which blood cells circulate in a vascular tree that is completely devoid of VWF. Murine platelets were isolated from Vwf (-/-) and Vwf (+/+) blood, exposed to VWF at 1800 s(-1) in a microfluidic platform, and examined by means of videomicroscopy, as well as fluorescence and activation studies. Proplatelets became visible within 5 minutes, representing 38% of all platelets after 12 minutes and 46% after 28 min. The proportion of proplatelets was 1.8-fold higher in blood from Vwf(-/-) mice than from Vwf(+/+) mice, suggesting a role of VWF in vivo. Fragmentation of these proplatelets into smaller discoid platelets was also observed in real-time. Platelets remained fully activatable by thrombin. Compensation of plasmatic VWF following hydrodynamic gene transfer in Vwf(-/-) mice reduced the percentage of proplatelets to wild-type levels. A thrombocytopenic mouse model was studied in the flow system, 7 days after a single 5-FU injection. Compared to untreated mouse blood, a 2-fold increase in the percentage of proplatelets was detected following exposure to 1800 s(-1) on VWF of samples from mice treated with 5-FU. In conclusion, VWF and shear stress together appear to upregulate proplatelet reorganization and platelet formation. This suggests a new function for VWF in vivo as regulator of bloodstream thrombopoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W1993279382,"TGF-β1 has the potential to activate multiple signaling pathways required for inducing metastatic potential of tumor cells. However, TGF-β1 was inefficient in inducing metastatic potential of many non-invasive human tumor cells. Here we report that the enhancement of TGF-β1 signaling is required for inducing metastatic potential of non-invasive breast cancer cells. TGF-β1 alone could not efficiently induce the sustained activation of Smad and non-Smad pathways in non-invasive breast cancer cells. TLR4 ligand (LPS) and H2O2 cooperated with TGF-β1 to enhance the sustained activation of non-Smad pathways, including p38MAPK, ERK, JNK, PI3K, and NF-κB. The activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways resulted in a positive feed-back effect on TGF-β1 signaling by down-regulating Nm23-H1 expression and up-regulating the expression of TβRI and TβRII, favoring further activation of multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the enhanced TGF-β1 signaling induced higher expression of SNAI2, which also promoted TβRII expression. Therefore, the sustained activation levels of both Smad and non-Smad pathways were gradually increased after prolonged stimulation with TGF-β1/H2O2/LPS. Consistent with the activation pattern of signaling pathways, the invasive capacity and anoikis-resistance of non-invasive breast cancer cells were gradually increased after prolonged stimulation with TGF-β1/H2O2/LPS. The metastatic potential induced by TGF-β1/H2O2/LPS was sufficient for tumor cells to extravasate and form metastatic foci in an experimental metastasis model in nude mice. The findings in this study suggested that the enhanced signaling is required for inducing higher metastatic capacity of tumor cells, and that targeting one of stimuli or signaling pathways might be potential approach in comprehensive strategy for tumor therapy."

Objectives To develop a molecular pathway-based prediction model of long term hepatocarcinogenicity using 90-day gene expression data and to evaluate the performance of this model with respect to both intra-species, dose-dependent and cross-species predictions. Methods Genome-wide hepatic mRNA expression was retrospectively measured in B6C3F1 mice following subchronic exposure to twenty-six (26) chemicals (10 were positive, 2 equivocal and 14 negative for liver tumors) previously studied by the US National Toxicology Program. Using these data, a pathway-based predictor model for long-term liver cancer risk was derived using random forests. The prediction model was independently validated on test sets associated with liver cancer risk obtained from mice, rats and humans. Results Using 5-fold cross validation, the developed prediction model had reasonable predictive performance with the area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) equal to 0.66. The developed prediction model was then used to extrapolate the results to data associated with rat and human liver cancer. The extrapolated model worked well for both extrapolated species (AUC value of 0.74 for rats and 0.91 for humans). The prediction models implied a balanced interplay between all pathway responses leading to carcinogenicity predictions. Conclusions Pathway-based prediction models estimated from sub-chronic data hold promise for predicting long-term carcinogenicity and also for its ability to extrapolate results across multiple species."
https://openalex.org/W2069992796,"Benzothiazole derivatives are known for various biological activities, and their potency in cancer therapy has received considerable attention in recent years. YLT322, a novel synthesized benzothiazole derivative, exhibits potent anti-tumor activity via inducing apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found that YLT322 showed growth inhibition against a broad spectrum of human cancer cells and induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The occurrence of its apoptosis was associated with activation of caspases-3 and -9, but not caspase-8. YLT322 increased the expression of Bax, decreased the expression of Bcl-2, and induced the release of cytochrome c which activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The down-regulation of phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK and phosphorylated Akt was also observed. Moreover, YLT322 suppressed the growth of established tumors in xenograft models in mice without obvious side effects. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed an increase in TUNEL and caspase-3-positive cells and a decrease in Ki67-positive cells upon YLT322. These results suggest that YLT322 may be a potential candidate for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1989265455,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether increased crown-to-implant (C/I) ratio influences implant stability or not under proper healthy control of peri-implant mucosa. The hypothesis of this study is that implant stability can be maintained despite High C/I, under appropriate plaque control.Five male Beagle-Labrador hybrid dogs (2 years old) were used. Their bilateral mandibular premolar extraction was performed. After allowing 12 weeks for bone healing, 3 types of vertical marginal bone loss were simultaneously prepared randomly. Then, 30 titanium implants were placed in the edentulous areas and defined as High C/I, Mid C/I and Low C/I groups. This time point was designated as the baseline (0 Week). Twelve weeks after implant placement, metal superstructures were cemented to the implants and an occlusal plate was set at the opposite side. At the same time, Calcein green was injected for remodeling evaluation. Implants were loaded by feeding the dogs a hard pellet diet. Tooth brushing was performed 5 days per week during the study to maintain healthy peri-implant mucosa. Twenty-four weeks following implant placement, the interface structure was evaluated clinically, radiologically, and histologically.Implant stability quotient (ISQ) increased with time in all 3 groups, without any significant correlation with the C/I value (p >0.05). Moreover, mean marginal bone loss adjacent around implants in all 3 groups ranged between 0.11 and 0.19 mm, with no significant difference (p >0.05). Many fluorescence-labeled bones are shown in the High C/I group. It is considered that high remodeling activity prevent marginal bone loss in the High C/I group and this may provide favorable implant stability under proper plaque control.These findings suggest that increased C/I may not be a risk factor for implant failure if the peri-implant mucosa is kept healthy, as was the case in this animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2068461880,"The members of the NR5A subfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs) are important regulators of pluripotency, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and steroidogenesis. Liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1; NR5A1) have therapeutic potential for the treatment of metabolic and neoplastic disease; however, a poor understanding of their ligand regulation has hampered the pursuit of these proteins as pharmaceutical targets. In this study, we dissect how sequence variation among LRH-1 orthologs affects phospholipid (PL) binding and regulation. Both human LRH-1 (hLRH-1) and mouse LRH-1 (mLRH-1) respond to newly discovered medium chain PL agonists to modulate lipid and glucose homeostasis. These PLs activate hLRH-1 by altering receptor dynamics in a newly identified alternate activation function region. Mouse and Drosophila orthologs contain divergent sequences in this region potentially altering PL-driven activation. Structural evidence suggests that these sequence differences in mLRH-1 and Drosophila FTZ-f1 (dmFTZ-f1) confer at least partial ligand independence, making them poor models for hLRH-1 studies; however, the mechanisms of ligand independence remain untested. We show using structural and biochemical methods that the recent evolutionary divergence of the mLRH-1 stabilizes the active conformation in the absence of ligand, yet does not abrogate PL-dependent activation. We also show by mass spectrometry and biochemical assays that FTZ-f1 is incapable of PL binding. This work provides a structural mechanism for the differential tuning of PL sensitivity in NR5A orthologs and supports the use of mice as viable therapeutic models for LRH-1-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1966416986,"Campylobacter jejuni remains one of the major gut pathogens of our time. Its zoonotic nature and wide-spread distribution in industrialized countries calls for a quick and reliable diagnostic tool. Antibody-based detection presents a suitable means to identify pathogenic bacteria. However, the knowledge about immunodominant targets is limited. Thus, an approach is presented, which allows for the rapid screening of numerous cDNA derived expression clones to identify novel antigens. The deeper understanding of immunodominant proteins assists in the design of diagnostic tools and furthers the insight into the bacterium's pathogenicity as well as revealing potential candidates for vaccination. We have successfully screened 1536 clones of an expression library to identify 22 proteins that have not been described as immunodominant before. After subcloning the corresponding 22 genes and expression of full-length proteins, we investigated the immunodominant character by microarrays and ELISA. Subsequently, seven proteins were selected for epitope mapping. For cj0669 and cj0920c linear epitopes were identified. For cj0669, specificity assays revealed a specific linear epitope site. Consequently, an eleven amino acid residue sequence TLIKELKRLGI was analyzed via alanine scan, which revealed the glycine residue to be significant for binding of the antibody. The innovative approach presented herein of generating cDNAs of prokaryotes in combination with a microarray platform rendering time-consuming purification steps obsolete has helped to illuminate novel immunodominant proteins of C.jejuni. The findings of a specific linear epitope pave the way for a plethora of future research and the potential use in diagnostic applications such as serological screenings. Moreover, the current approach is easily adaptable to other highly relevant bacteria making it a formidable tool for the future discovery of antigens and potential biomarkers. Consequently, it is desirable to simplify the identification of structural epitopes, as this would extend the spectrum of novel epitopes to be detected."
https://openalex.org/W2015577843,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), caused by FMD virus (FMDV), is a highly contagious viral disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals. Camelids have a unique immunoglobulin profile, with the smallest functional heavy-chain antibodies (sdAb or VHH) naturally devoid of light chains with antigen-binding capacity. We screened and characterized five sdAbs against FMDV by immunized library from C. bactrianus with Asia 1 virus-like particles (VLPs). Three of five recombinant sdAbs were stably expressed in E.coli, remained highly soluble, and were serotype-specific for VP1 protein of FMDV Asia 1 by ELISA. These failed to completely neutralize the Asia 1 virus. According to the KD value of binding affinity to three sdAbs, which ranged from 0.44 to 0.71 nm by SPR, sdAb-C6 was selected and conjugated with Zn/CdSe quantum dots (QDs) to form a QDs-C6 probe, which was used to trace and image the subcellular location of FMDV in BHK-21 cells. The results show that FMD virions were observed from 3 h.p.i., and most of virions were distributed on one side of the nucleus in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate the utility of sdAbs as functionalized QDs are powerful tools for FMDV research."
https://openalex.org/W2026751253,"Serotonin in blood plasma is primarily synthesized in the duodenum, as brain derived serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Because serotonin in the brain and retina is synthesized under the control of a circadian clock, we sought to determine if a circadian clock in the duodenum regulates serotonin synthesis and release in blood. We examined gene expression in the duodenum of chickens at different times of the day and found that the duodenum rhythmically expresses molecular circadian clock genes and genes controlling serotonin biosynthesis, specifically tryptophan hydroxylase, in a light dark cycle (LD). Analysis of the duodenum and blood plasma showed that the amount of serotonin in the duodenum varies across the day and that serotonin profiles in blood plasma are also rhythmic in LD, but were not rhythmic in constant darkness. Because serotonin in the gut affects duodenal nutrient absorption and gut motility, the control of serotonin production in the duodenum by LD cycles could provide an additional mechanism by which the external environment controls nutrient uptake and digestive function. The diurnal regulation of plasma serotonin may also serve as an additional biochemical signal in the blood encoding time and could be used by target tissues to indicate the status of nutrient absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2004122261,"A considerable number of host-specific biological control agents fail to control invasive plants in the field, and exploring the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is important and helpful for the management of invasive plants. Herbivory and competition are two of the most common biotic stressors encountered by invasive plants in their recipient communities. We predicted that the antagonistic interactive effect between herbivory and competition would weaken the effect of herbivory on invasive plants and result in the failure of herbivory to control invasive plants. To examine this prediction, thus, we conducted an experiment in which both invasive Mikania micrantha and native Coix lacryma-job i were grown together and subjected to herbivory-mimicking defoliation. Both defoliation and competition had significantly negative effects on the growth of the invader. However, the negative effect of 75% respective defoliation on the above- and below-ground biomass of Mikania micrantha was alleviated by presence of Coix lacryma-jobi. The negative effect of competition on the above- and below-ground biomass was equally compensated at 25%, 50% and 100% defoliation and overcompensated at 75% defoliation. The interactive effect was antagonistic and dependent on the defoliation intensity, with the maximum effect at 75% defoliation. The antagonistic interaction between defoliation and competition appears to be able to release the invader from competition, thus facilitating the invasiveness of Mikania, a situation that might make herbivory fail to inhibit the growth of invasive Mikania in the invaded community."
https://openalex.org/W2017125864,"Here we performed structural and biochemical analyses on the TK2285 gene product, an uncharacterized protein annotated as a member of the ribokinase family, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis. The three-dimensional structure of the TK2285 protein resembled those of previously characterized members of the ribokinase family including ribokinase, adenosine kinase, and phosphofructokinase. Conserved residues characteristic of this protein family were located in a cleft of the TK2285 protein as in other members whose structures have been determined. We thus examined the kinase activity of the TK2285 protein toward various sugars recognized by well characterized ribokinase family members. Although activity with sugar phosphates and nucleosides was not detected, kinase activity was observed toward d-allose, d-lyxose, d-tagatose, d-talose, d-xylose, and d-xylulose. Kinetic analyses with the six sugar substrates revealed high Km values, suggesting that they were not the true physiological substrates. By examining activity toward amino sugars, sugar alcohols, and disaccharides, we found that the TK2285 protein exhibited prominent kinase activity toward myo-inositol. Kinetic analyses with myo-inositol revealed a greater kcat and much lower Km value than those obtained with the monosaccharides, resulting in over a 2,000-fold increase in kcat/Km values. TK2285 homologs are distributed among members of Thermococcales, and in most species, the gene is positioned close to a myo-inositol monophosphate synthase gene. Our results suggest the presence of a novel subfamily of the ribokinase family whose members are present in Archaea and recognize myo-inositol as a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1964741489,"Prior to this study, the earliest appearance of circulating endothelial cells in warm-blooded animals was unknown. Time-lapse imaging of germ-line transformed Tie1-YFP reporter quail embryos combined with the endothelial marker antibody QH1 provides definitive evidence for the existence of circulating endothelial cells – from the very beginning of blood flow. Blood-smear counts of circulating cells from Tie1-YFP embryos showed that up to 30% of blood-borne cells are Tie1 positive; though cells expressing low levels of YFP were also positive for benzidine, a hemoglobin stain, suggesting that these cells were differentiating into erythroblasts. Electroporation-based time-lapse experiments, exclusively targeting the intra-embryonic mesoderm were combined with QH1 immunostaining. The latter antibody marks quail endothelial cells. Together the optical data provide conclusive evidence that endothelial cells can enter blood flow from vessels of the embryo proper, as well as from extra-embryonic areas. When Tie1-YFP positive cells and tissues are transplanted to wild type host embryos, fluorescent cells emigrate from such transplants and join host vessels; subsequently a few YFP cells are shed into circulation. These data establish that entering circulation is a commonplace activity of embryonic vascular endothelial cells. We conclude that in the class of vertebrates most closely related to mammals a normal component of primary vasculogenesis is production of endothelial cells that enter circulation from all vessels, both intra- and extra-embryonic."
https://openalex.org/W2010366579,"Aims To assess the impact of a simple computer-based decision-support system (computer help) on the quality of nutrition support orders and patients' outcome in Intensive-Care Unit (ICU). Methods This quality-improvement study was carried out in a 16-bed medical-surgical ICU in a French university hospital. All consecutive patients who stayed in ICU more than 10 days with non-oral feeding for more than 5 days were retrospectively included during two 12-month periods. Prescriptions of nutrition support were collected and compared to French national guidelines as a quality-improvement process. A computer help was constructed using a simple Excel-sheet (MicrosoftTM) to guide physicians' prescriptions according to guidelines. This computer help was displayed in computers previously used for medical orders. Physicians were informed but no systematic protocol was implemented. Patients included during the first (control group) and second period (computer help group) were compared for achievement of nutrition goals and ICU outcomes. Results The control and computer help groups respectively included 71 and 95 patients. Patients' characteristics were not significantly different between groups. In the computer help group, prescriptions achieved significantly more often 80% of nutrition goals for calorie (45% vs. 79% p<0.001) and nitrogen intake (3% vs. 37%, p<0.001). Incidence of nosocomial infections decreased significantly between the two groups (59% vs. 41%, p = 0.03). Mortality did not significantly differ between control (21%) and computer help groups (15%, p = 0.30). Conclusions Use of a widespread inexpensive computer help is associated with significant improvements in nutrition support orders and decreased nosocomial infections in ICU patients. This computer-help is provided in electronic supplement."

The enzyme is activated by the binding of two cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions at the high affinity transport sites (E2 to E1Ca2, step 1 in Fig. 1) and autophosphorylated at Asp351 with MgATP to form an ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P, step 2), which reacts with ADP to regenerate ATP in the reverse reaction. Upon E1P formation, the two bound Ca2+ are occluded in the transport sites (E1PCa2). The subsequent isomeric transition to the ADP-insensitive E2P form results in rearrangements of the Ca2+ binding sites to deocclude Ca2+, reduce the affinity, and open the lumenal gate, thus releasing Ca2+ into the lumen (step 3). Finally the Asp351-acylphosphate in E2P is hydrolyzed to form a Ca2+-unbound inactive E2 state (step 4). The enzyme consists of three cytoplasmic domains: nucleotide binding (N), phosphorylation (P), and actuator (A), and 10 transmembrane helices (M1–M10) (Fig. 2) (1.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H.

In the catalytic cycle, the transition of an autophosphorylated intermediate (EP) from E1PCa2 to the Ca2+-released form E2P by structural change (EP transition, E1PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+) is a key rate-limiting step (Fig. 1). During the transition, the A domain rotates from its position in E1PCa2 and the P domain with M4/M5 inclines to form a tight A-P domain association. Space for the A domain is created by the N domain swinging upwards at the N-P domain hinge, and the membrane helices rearrange reducing the Ca2+ affinity and opening the lumenal gate (Fig. 2). To understand the energy coupling, it is crucial to elucidate motive forces for the domain motions; how they are produced and how they function. The critical importance of several inter-domain interactions between the A and P domains is demonstrated by close contacts of residues in the E2P structure (14.Kato S. Kamidochi M. Daiho T.

Other crucial questions, as yet unexplored, are how the N domain motion occurs and whether it plays an active role in the EP transition. ADP needs to be released first, since the N domain is cross-linked by ATP producing the closed N-P domain organization for phosphoryl transfer. The N domain is connected with the P domain via two short loops and no structural elements seem to induce or guide the required motion for creating the space for the A domain.

We show that the N-P domain long-range electrostatic interactions markedly accelerate the EP transition probably by directing the N domain toward the P domain at their hinge, thereby opening up space for the in-swinging A domain. We also reveal residues on the N and P domains generating the critical long-range electrostatic interactions and the role of K+ specifically bound to the P domain of the ATPase for inducing the proper and efficient structural change. In general, the contribution of long-range electrostatic interactions between charged residues on the surface of the protein to enzyme catalysis have not received much attention because they are thought to be substantially masked by solvent. However, by using a systematic approach, we reveal the existence of such interactions in the Ca2+-pump and how they play a crucial role in domain dynamics. The approach may be usefully applied to elucidating electrostatics influences on structural transitions in other enzymes.

The phosphorylation was terminated by adding an equal volume of a solution containing 2 mm EGTA without CaCl2 and [γ-32P]ATP otherwise as described above. At various time points, the total amount of EP was determined following the addition of trichloroacetic acid. The amount of E2P was determined by adding an equal volume of a solution containing 2 mm ADP and 5 mm EGTA without CaCl2 and [γ-32P]ATP otherwise as described above, followed by trichloroacetic acid addition at 1 s after the ADP addition (Fig. 3). The amount of EP was quantified with digital autoradiography after separation by 5% SDS-PAGE at pH 6.0 according to Weber and Osborn (22.Weber K. Osborn M.

Total electrostatic interaction energy of interacting solutes i and j in a whole system (Eelectric) can be described as the sum of each interaction energy (Eij). Eelectric=∑jnj∑i≠jniEij(Eq. 1) Here ni and nj are the number of i and j, respectively, which are proportional to their concentrations ci and cj, therefore, Eelectric⋑ cicj(Eq. 2) Ionic solutes in an ionic solution do not behave ideally even at low concentrations. Their charges are shielded by surrounding ions in the environment, and therefore for understanding the behavior of the solute, its activity (a) rather than concentration (c) is utilized in a real system. In general, an increase in ionic strength decreases the activity of the solute thereby attenuating its electrostatic interaction energy. By using the mean activity coefficient of solutes (γ±), the activity is given as Equation 3. a=γ±c3 The electrostatic interaction energy is therefore proportional to the square of the mean activity coefficient. Eelectric∝γ±2cicj4 For a protein with its concentration c, the electrostatic interaction energy between the positively charged and negatively charged residues is described. Eelectric∝γ±2c25 The mean activity coefficient γ± can be estimated according to the specific ion interaction theory as described below. In the specific ion interaction theory, an extension to the Debye-Hückel theory (23.Brönsted J.N. Studies on solubility. IV. The principle of the specific interaction of ions.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1922; 44: 877-898Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24.Scatchard G. Concentrated solutions of strong electrolytes.Chem. Rev. 1936; 19: 309-327Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 25.Guggenheim E.A. Turgeon J.C. Specific interaction of ions.Trans. Faraday Soc. 1955; 51: 747-761Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the activity coefficient of an ion, e.g. j (γj), in a solution with an ionic strength I is expressed. logγj=Zj20.51I1+1.5I+∑kbjkCk6 Here z, b, and c are the electric charge of j, the specific ion interaction theory parameter (i.e. the interaction coefficient of salts), and the concentration of an interacting salt ion k in the environment, respectively. The first term comes from the Debye-Hückel theory. The second term with the specific ion interaction theory parameter shows how the contribution of “interaction” is dependent on the concentration ck. Thus, the specific ion interaction theory parameter is used as a correction to the first term derived from the Debye-Hückel theory. According to this equation and the fact that all the charges in the protein are monovalent (z = 1), the mean activity coefficient of protein in ionic solution was estimated as follows. In the experiments, the ionic strength was varied with the chloride salt of monovalent cations (M+) in the presence of low and constant concentrations of buffer and other solutes (Mg2+ and Ca2+), therefore we divided the second term (correction factor) into variable and constant (const) terms, and considered the negatively charged residues and positively charged residues, ∑kbjkCk=bjM+cM++const1(Eq. 7) for negatively charged residues, and ∑kbjkCk=bjCI+cCI−+const2(Eq. 8) for the positively charged residues. By adding these two equations, the mean activity coefficient of protein is defined as Equation 9. logγ±2=20.51I1+1.5I+bJMCICMCI+const3(bjMCI=bjM++bjCI−)9 We first calculated the γ±2 value solely according to the Debye-Hückel theory (the first term) without taking into account the second (correction) and third (constant) terms, and plotted the logarithm of the EP transition rate versus γ±2 thus estimated. The plot showed a very good linear relationship. Nevertheless, we employed the second term (without third term) by estimating bjMCl by best fit in a linear regression. The values bjMCl thus estimated were actually very small, i.e. 0.03, 0.01, −0.01, and −0.01 for KCl, LiCl, NaCl, and choline-Cl, respectively, showing the plots almost identical to those without the second and third terms. Homology models of SERCA1a mutants were generated from SERCA1a PDB files by the program MODELLER (26.Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar). PDB format files of the wild type and mutants were converted by the PDB2PQR server to PQR format files that possess information on per-atom charge and radius (27.Dolinsky T.J. Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Baker N.A. PDB2PQR. An automated pipeline for the setup of Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics calculations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W665-W667Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar), and then applied to the simulation program APBS to calculate the electric potential on the three-dimensional structure in aqueous media containing salt (21.Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Electrostatics of nanosystems. Application to microtubules and the ribosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar). In APBS, the parameters were set to 78.58, 2, 0.15 m, and 298.15 K for the dielectric constant (relative permittivity) of water at 25 °C, that of the protein (28.Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar), the concentration of salts, and temperature, respectively. Three-dimensional models of SERCA1a and its mutants were reproduced and electric field lines were visualized by the program VMD (29.Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD. Visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38418) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (30.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc.). To explore effects of ionic strength and monovalent cations on the EP transition E1PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+, we determined the EP transition time course using 0.1–1 m monovalent chloride salts (see representative ones in Fig. 3). These transition rates (k3) are summarized in Fig. 4A. The rate in 0.1 m KCl and NaCl was much higher than that in the absence of salt, showing a marked acceleration of the EP transition by K+ (Na+). The binding of K+ (Na+) to a specific site on the P domain is known to occur below this concentration range and to accelerate E2P hydrolysis (5.Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Crystal structure of the calcium pump with a bound ATP analogue.Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 31.Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J.

Clausen J.D. Jensen A.M. Vilsen B. Møller J.V. Andersen J.P. Nissen P. Localization of a K+-binding site involved in dephosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46355-46358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The K+ acceleration occurs in a lower concentration range compared with that for Na+, the effect is nevertheless, apparently saturated by 0.1 m for both cations (31.Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J. Activation of calcium transport in skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum by monovalent cations.J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6947-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidently, another consequence is to accelerate the EP transition from E1PCa2 to E2P, as found here. With increasing KCl (or NaCl) above 0.1 m, the rate decreased markedly. The rate in LiCl was somewhat higher than that in the absence of salt, and did not change in the 0.1–1 m range. The rate in 0.1–1 m choline-Cl was close to that without salts, suggesting no choline+ binding. In contrast, with increasing LiCl and choline-Cl in the presence of 0.1 m KCl (Fig. 4B), the rate decreased markedly with the same concentration dependence as in KCl or NaCl, thus showing that in the ATPase with specifically bound K+ (or Na+), attenuation of electrostatic energy by increasing ionic strength retards the EP transition. Therefore the electric force functions to accelerate the reaction. Note also in Figs. 3C and 4B that Li+ even at the high concentrations (0.6 or 0.9 m) in 0.1 m K+ does not affect the unique kinetics of the K+-bound ATPase, therefore not inhibiting the specific binding of K+ at 0.1 m. The logarithm of rate is a linear function of activation energy. Electrostatic energy between interacting charges is expected to be proportional to the product of activities of the charges and therefore to the square of the mean activity coefficient γ±2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Hence a plot of the logarithm of rate versus γ±2 would give a linear relationship and thereby divide the activation energy into two components, an electrostatic force and a non-electrostatic force; i.e. the slope reflects the amplitude of the contribution of electrostatic energy, and the intercept at γ±2 = 0 reveals the contribution of non-electrostatic energy because these are conditions in which the electrostatic interactions that are able to be screened on the protein surface are completely shielded by salt. Note here that electrostatic forces of residues within the protein, inaccessible to salts, and formed by close strong contacts even on the protein surface are not shielded. In Fig. 5, plots of the data in Fig. 4 do indeed show a linear relationship. In KCl and NaCl as well as in LiCl and choline-Cl with 0.1 m KCl, the plot gave a nearly identical steep positive slope showing the marked acceleration by electric force in the K+ (or Na+)-bound ATPase (Table 1). In contrast, without K+, the slope was nearly zero in LiCl or slightly negative in choline-Cl, showing apparently no effect or a negative effect of an electrostatic component. Notably also, the intercept at γ±2 = 0 in KCl and NaCl as well as in LiCl and choline-Cl with 0.1 m KCl was much lower than that in LiCl and choline-Cl without KCl, showing that a substantial non-electrostatic restriction is produced by K+ (Na+) binding for the EP transition. Thus at ∼0.1 m K+ (physiological conditions), the bound K+ markedly accelerates the EP transition as a consequence of an electrostatic effect overcoming a non-electrostatic restriction.TABLE 1Fitting parameters in Fig. 5SaltFitting parametersaThe values presented are the mean ± S.E. in a least-squares fitting.InterceptSlopeKCl−2.57 ± 0.092.52 ± 0.18NaCl−2.48 ± 0.112.50 ± 0.23LiCl−1.39 ± 0.140.02 ± 0.30Choline-Cl−1.43 ± 0.05−0.32 ± 0.120.1 m KCl + LiCl−2.59 ± 0.102.59 ± 0.220.1 m KCl + choline-Cl−2.53 ± 0.102.48 ± 0.20a The values presented are the mean ± S.E. in a least-squares fitting.

https://openalex.org/W2058323759,"The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder has long maintained an uncertain status in psychiatric nosology. Studies comparing clinical and biological features of patients with schizoaffective disorder to patients with related disorders [e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder] can provide an evidence base for judging the validity of the diagnostic category. However, because most prior studies of schizoaffective disorder have only evaluated differences between groups at a static timepoint, it is unclear how these disorders may be related when the entire illness course is taken into consideration.We ascertained a large cohort [N = 993] of psychiatric patients with a range of psychotic diagnoses including schizophrenia with no history of major affective episodes [SZ-; N = 371], schizophrenia with a superimposed mood syndrome [SZ+; N = 224], schizoaffective disorder [SAD; N = 129] and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features [BPD+; N = 269]. Using cross-sectional data we designed key clinical and neurocognitive dependent measures that allowed us to test longitudinal hypotheses about the differences between these diagnostic entities.Large differences between diagnostic groups on several demographic and clinical variables were observed. Most notably, groups differed on a putative measure of cognitive decline. Specifically, the SAD group demonstrated significantly greater post-onset cognitive decline compared to the BP+ group, with the SZ- and SZ+ group both exhibiting levels of decline intermediate to BPD+ and SAD.These results suggest that schizoaffective disorder may possess distinct features. Contrary to earlier formulations, schizoaffective disorder may be a more severe form of illness."
https://openalex.org/W2127120589,"The 16 kDa heat shock protein (HSP) is an immuno-dominant antigen, used in diagnosis of infectious Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.) causing tuberculosis (TB). Its use in serum-based diagnostics is limited, but for the direct identification of M.tb. bacteria in sputum or cultures it may represent a useful tool. Recently, a broad set of twelve 16 kDa specific heavy chain llama antibodies (VHH) has been isolated, and their utility for diagnostic applications was explored.To identify the epitopes recognized by the nine (randomly selected from a set of twelve 16 kDa specific VHH antibodies) distinct VHH antibodies, 14 overlapping linear epitopes (each 20 amino acid long) were characterized using direct and sandwich ELISA techniques. Seven out of 14 epitopes were recognized by 8 out of 9 VHH antibodies. The two highest affinity binders B-F10 and A-23 were found to bind distinct epitopes. Sandwich ELISA and SPR experiments showed that only B-F10 was suitable as secondary antibody with both B-F10 and A-23 as anchoring antibodies. To explain this behavior, the epitopes were matched to the putative 3D structure model. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography were used to determine the higher order conformation. A homodimer model best explained the differential immunological reactivity of A-23 and B-F10 against heat-treated M.tb. lysates.The concentrations of secreted antigens of M.tb. in sputum are too low for immunological detection and existing kits are only used for identifying M.tb. in cultures. Here we describe how specific combinations of VHH domains could be used to detect the intracellular HSP antigen. Linked to methods of pre-concentrating M.tb. cells prior to lysis, HSP detection may enable the development of protein-based diagnostics of sputum samples and earlier diagnosis of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2043766100,"Background How accurately do people perceive extreme water speeds and how does their perception affect perceived risk? Prior research has focused on the characteristics of moving water that can reduce human stability or balance. The current research presents the first experiment on people's perceptions of risk and moving water at different speeds and depths. Methods Using a randomized within-person 2 (water depth: 0.45, 0.90 m) ×3 (water speed: 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 m/s) experiment, we immersed 76 people in moving water and asked them to estimate water speed and the risk they felt. Results Multilevel modeling showed that people increasingly overestimated water speeds as actual water speeds increased or as water depth increased. Water speed perceptions mediated the direct positive relationship between actual water speeds and perceptions of risk; the faster the moving water, the greater the perceived risk. Participants' prior experience with rip currents and tropical cyclones moderated the strength of the actual–perceived water speed relationship; consequently, mediation was stronger for people who had experienced no rip currents or fewer storms. Conclusions These findings provide a clearer understanding of water speed and risk perception, which may help communicate the risks associated with anticipated floods and tropical cyclones."

The aim of this study was to test and verify experimentally the accuracy of a causal inference approach based on genomic randomization using esophageal cancer samples. Two candidates with strong regulatory effects emerging from our analysis are components of growth factor receptors, and implicated in cancer development, namely ERBB2 and FGFR2. We tested experimentally two ERBB2 and three FGFR2 regulated interactions predicted by the statistical analysis, all of which were confirmed. We also applied the method in a meta-analysis of 10 cancer datasets and tested 15 of the predicted regulatory interactions experimentally. Three additional predicted ERBB2 regulated interactions were confirmed, as well as interactions regulated by ARPC1A and FANCG. Overall, two thirds of experimentally tested predictions were confirmed."
