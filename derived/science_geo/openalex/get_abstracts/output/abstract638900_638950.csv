However, whether this is true for functional network activity remains unknown, primarily due to experimental inaccessibility of the initial stages of the living human brain. Here, we developed human cortical organoids that dynamically change cellular populations during maturation and exhibited consistent increases in electrical activity over the span of several months. The spontaneous network formation displayed periodic and regular oscillatory events that were dependent on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. The oscillatory activity transitioned to more spatiotemporally irregular patterns, and synchronous network events resembled features similar to those observed in preterm human electroencephalography. These results show that the development of structured network activity in a human neocortex model may follow stable genetic programming. Our approach provides opportunities for investigating and manipulating the role of network activity in the developing human cortex.

Diverse and hierarchical cellular networks develop into circuits with patterns of functional spatiotemporal activity to form the human brain. Neural oscillations, a prominent, rhythmic brain signal found across species, robustly track behavioral and disease states and have long been leveraged in systems neuroscience due to their ubiquity and accessibility (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G.

However, due to an inability to interrogate the electrophysiology of intact embryonic brains, it remains unknown whether the same happens in humans. As a result, our knowledge about human brain functional development rests upon observations from nonhuman model systems. Organoids generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a scaled-down and three-dimensional model of the human brain, mimicking various developmental features at the cellular and molecular levels (Camp et al., 2015Camp J.G.

Despite recent advances in the understanding of their cellular diversity, there is no evidence that these organoids develop complex and functional neural network activity that resembles early human brain formation (Birey et al., 2017Birey F.

Kinney J.P. et al.Cell diversity and network dynamics in photosensitive human brain organoids.Nature. 2017; 545: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Therefore, researchers have not yet clearly determined whether brain organoids are a suitable model for neural network dynamics (Kelava and Lancaster, 2016Kelava I. Lancaster M.A. Stem cell models of human brain development.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, Pașca, 2018Pașca S.P. The rise of three-dimensional human brain cultures.Nature. 2018; 553: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Here, we use human iPSCs to generate cortical organoids that exhibit evolving cellular transcriptional profile and nested oscillatory network dynamics over the span of several months. We subsequently investigated the molecular basis of oscillatory activity formation, maintenance, and temporal control. Finally, we applied supervised machine learning with cross-validation to evaluate the similarity between electrophysiological network activity patterns of the in vitro model and human preterm neonatal electroencephalogram (EEG). Our findings suggest that organoid models are suitable for the investigation of the physiological basis of network formation at early and late stages of the human brain development. This prolonged evaluation of cortical organoid activity expands our understanding of the emergence of network-level neurodynamics in humans. Despite the structural and transcriptional similarities between brain organoids and the developing nervous system, the emergence of higher level complex network activity comparable to the living human brain remains largely untested (Figure 1A). To investigate the formation of a functional network, we promoted cortical specification by previously described protocols (Paşca et al., 2015Paşca A.M. Sloan S.A. Clarke L.E. Tian Y. Makinson C.D.

Methods. 2019; 16: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar; Figure 1B; see STAR Methods for details). At the beginning of differentiation, an abundance of proliferative neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (expressing Ki67, SOX2, and Nestin) that self-organized into a polarized neuroepithelium-like structure was observed. Similar to human cortical development in vivo, the proliferative zone around a lumen delimited by β-catenin+ cells was surrounded by progenitor cells. Progressively, the organoids increased in size and in the proportion of mature neurons (expressing NeuN and MAP2) to ultimately develop into concentric multilayer structures composed of NPCs, intermediate progenitors (TBR2; also known as EOMES), and lower (CTIP2; also known as BCL11B) and upper (SATB2) cortical layer neurons (Figures 1C–1E and S1). The neurons exhibit dendritic protrusions and synaptic ultrastructure (Figures 1F and 1G). After 6 months, inhibitory neurons can also be observed (calretinin [CR], also known as CALB2; GABAB; NKX2.1, also known as TTF1; GABA; LHX6; somatostatin [SST]; and parvalbumin [PV]; Figures 1D and S1). Although the initial fraction of GFAP-positive cells was less than 5%, this population increased to about 30%–40% after 6 months of differentiation (Figures 1D and 1E). To characterize the cellular diversity of cortical organoids during development, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on 1-, 3-, 6-, and 10-month organoids (Figures 1H–1M and S1; Table S1). We used unsupervised clustering on the combined dataset of 15,990 cells to identify clusters and their relative abundance at distinct time points. Based on the expression gene markers, we combined smaller subclusters into five major cell classes: progenitors; intermediate progenitors; glial cells; glutamatergic neurons; and GABAergic neurons. Based on this annotation, 1-month organoids consisted of >70% progenitor cells (expressing SOX2 and PAX6; Figures 1J and 1M). At the 3- and 6-month stage, cortical organoids comprised mainly glia (SLC1A3) and glutamatergic neurons (GRIA2 and SNAP25; Figures 1J and 1M). The glial cells started with a small population and increased to around 40% of cells present in the cortical organoids. Remaining populations of progenitors (around 5%) and intermediate progenitors (around 10%) were present throughout the maturation. A fraction of glutamatergic neurons at the 3- and 6-month time point expressed subunits of GABAergic receptors, such as GABRB3 (Figure S1C). This expression of GABAergic receptors predates the appearance of interneurons. GABAergic neurons were mainly restricted to 6- to 10-month organoids, as indicated by expression of GAD2 (also known as GAD65), DLX1, and DLX5 (Figures 1J–1M, S1C, and S1D), reaching around 15% of the total neuronal population after 10 months of maturation, consistent with its presence later in the in vivo development (Uylings et al., 2002Uylings H.B.M. Delalle I. Petanjek Z. Koenderink M.J.T. Structural and immunocytochemical differentiation of neurons in prenatal and postnatal human prefrontal cortex.Neuroembryology. 2002; 1: 176-186Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The molecular profile of GABAergic neurons was further evaluated by single-cell transcriptomics (Figure S1E) and by the presence of protein markers (Figure S1F). To demonstrate the biosynthesis of GABA during the maturation process, we employed metabolomics liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (Gertsman et al., 2014Gertsman I. Gangoiti J.A. Barshop B.A. Validation of a dual LC-HRMS platform for clinical metabolic diagnosis in serum, bridging quantitative analysis and untargeted metabolomics.Metabolomics. 2014; 10: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The neurotransmitter GABA was detected in the culture media of cortical organoids after 6 months of maturation (Figure S1G) in a physiologically relevant concentration (Van Hove and Thomas, 2014Van Hove J.L.K. Thomas J.A. Disorders of glycine, serine, GABA, and proline metabolism.in: Blau N. Duran M. Gibson K.M. Dionisi Vici C. Physician’s Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2014: 63-83Crossref Google Scholar). These results suggest the presence of the basic components for the generation of a neural network in a developing human cortical in vitro model. In addition to the observed cellular diversity and expression of synaptic markers, we interrogated the presence of functional network activity. Starting at a single cellular level, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recording from 6-month cortical organoids (Figures S2A–S2E). The action potential firing activity and the voltage-dependent Na+ current were tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitive. Application of glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX and AP5) fully inhibited the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded at −60 mV, confirming the presence of functional excitatory neurons. To further evaluate the cortical organoid functionality in a mesoscopic level, we performed weekly extracellular recordings of spontaneous electrical activity using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Cortical organoids were plated per well in 8 wells of a MEA plate containing 64 low-impedance (0.04 MΩ) platinum microelectrodes with 30 μm of diameter spaced by 200 μm, yielding a total of 512 channels. We separately analyzed single-channel and population firing characteristics derived from channel-wise spike times and the local field potential (LFP), a measure of aggregate synaptic currents and other slow ionic exchanges (Buzsáki et al., 2012Buzsáki G. Anastassiou C.A. Koch C. The origin of extracellular fields and currents--EEG, ECoG, LFP and spikes.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar; Figure 2A). The spikes were defined by the event unit waveforms standard structure with typical refractory periods and by pharmacological intervention. These spikes from each channel do not represent putative single-unit action potentials but represent multi-unit activity (MUA). Because both the spatial and temporal resolution of MEA sampling is sparse, single-unit spike trains were not isolated, instead submitting channel-wise and whole-well activity for further analysis rather than individual spike trains. Over the course of 10 months, cortical organoids exhibited consistent increases in electrical activity, as parametrized by channel-wise firing rate, burst frequency, and synchrony (Figures 2B–2D and S2F–S2I), which indicates a continually evolving neural network. Additionally, the variability between replicates over 40 weeks of differentiation was significantly lower compared to iPSC-derived neurons in monolayer cultures (Figures 2C, inset, and S2J). During individual recordings, cultures displayed a robust pattern of activity, switching between long periods of quiescence and short bursts of spontaneous network-synchronized spiking (hereafter referred to as “network events”). These network events were periodic (∼0.05 Hz) but infrequent early in development (∼2 months), occurring roughly every 20 s and decayed monotonically after the initial onset (Figure 2E). From 4 months onward, a secondary peak emerged 300–500 ms after the initial network activation, leading to the presence of a nested faster oscillatory (2 or 3 Hz) pattern up to 6 months in culture (Figures 2F and S3A–S3F). Notably, this robust fast timescale nested oscillation was not observed in 3D neurospheres, suggesting that the spherical arrangement of neurons is insufficient for the emergence of nested oscillations (Figures S3G–S3J). The regular oscillatory activity during network events transitioned to stronger, yet more variable, oscillations over time. To quantify this network complexity, we tracked the regularity (coefficient of variation of inter-event intervals [CV]) and the spatial and temporal correlation between spontaneous network events. The inter-event interval CV consistently increased over 10 months of differentiation (Figure 2G), from extremely regular latencies (CV ≅ 0) at 2 months to irregular, Poisson-like (CV ≅ 1) at 10 months. This indicates increased variability between consecutive network events initiation. Additionally, spatial and temporal irregularity on a shorter timescale (within event) also increased with development, suggesting a breakdown of deterministic population dynamics from the onset of network events. Periodic oscillatory activity is often defined as a “bump” over the characteristic 1/f background in the power spectral density (PSD) of extracellular signals above and beyond the aperiodic 1/f signal (Buzsáki et al., 2013Buzsáki G.

Peterson E.J. Voytek B. Inferring synaptic excitation/inhibition balance from field potentials.Neuroimage. 2017; 158: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In organoid LFPs, we observed both prominent oscillatory peaks in the low-frequency range (1–4 Hz) and in the aperiodic signal characteristic of neural recordings (Ben-Ari, 2001Ben-Ari Y. Developing networks play a similar melody.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 353-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, Voytek et al., 2015Voytek B. Kayser A.S. Badre D. Fegen D. Chang E.F. Crone N.E. Parvizi J. Knight R.T. D’Esposito M. Oscillatory dynamics coordinating human frontal networks in support of goal maintenance.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The development of oscillatory activity in cortical organoids over time was quantified by computing the PSD for each LFP recording (Figure 2H, inset). Oscillatory power in the delta range (1–4 Hz) increased for up to 24 weeks in culture, tapering off slightly in subsequent recordings and plateauing during the last 10 weeks. This inverted-U trajectory reflects the network’s initial acquisition of oscillatory modes at steady frequencies and the dispersion of this regularity at later time points. The LFP results reveal the development of the cortical organoid cultures across different network states: from sparse activity with extreme rigidity and regularity to one that acquires repetitive and regular oscillatory patterns (Voytek and Knight, 2015Voytek B.

Psychiatry. 2015; 77: 1089-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), until it finally reaches a stage of higher spatiotemporal complexity and variability that is reminiscent of self-organized networks (Tetzlaff et al., 2010Tetzlaff C.

Biol. 2010; 6: e1001013Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; Figures 2I, 2J, and S3C–S3F). Oscillatory dynamics have been postulated to coordinate spiking across neural ensembles. In the LFP and other mesoscopic brain signals, this manifests as a phenomenon known as cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) (Voytek and Knight, 2015Voytek B. Knight R.T. Dynamic network communication as a unifying neural basis for cognition, development, aging, and disease.Biol. Psychiatry. 2015; 77: 1089-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), wherein the high-frequency content of the LFP is entrained to the phase of slow oscillations (Manning et al., 2009Manning J.R.

Hasson U. Fried I. Malach R. Coupling between neuronal firing, field potentials, and FMRI in human auditory cortex.Science. 2005; 309: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In the cortical organoids, we observed greater PAC between oscillatory delta (1–4 Hz) and broadband gamma activity (100–400 Hz; see STAR Methods) during network events compared to quiescent periods (Figures 3A–3C). This broadband gamma is non-oscillatory but has been shown to be an LFP surrogate of population spiking (Manning et al., 2009Manning J.R. Jacobs J. Fried I. Kahana M.J. Broadband shifts in local field potential power spectra are correlated with single-neuron spiking in humans.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13613-13620Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, Miller et al., 2007Miller K.J. Leuthardt E.C. Schalk G. Rao R.P. Anderson N.R. Moran D.W. Miller J.W. Ojemann J.G. Spectral changes in cortical surface potentials during motor movement.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2424-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We further evaluated the role of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in forming oscillations by pharmacological intervention. Organoid neural networks were susceptible to both glutamate receptor antagonists (AP5 and CNQX; NMDA and AMPA/kainate, respectively) and GABA receptor agonists (muscimol, GABAA; baclofen, GABAB) by significantly reducing the number of spike events and bursts, with a subsequent extinction of synchronous activity. The electrical activity was abolished in the presence of TTX (Figures 3D and 3E). Blockade of GABAergic transmission by bicuculline increased the number of network-synchronized events and did not affect peak population firing rates but abolished nested 2-Hz oscillatory activity by erasing subsequent reverberant peaks (Figure 3F). Despite emergence of complex oscillatory network activity in organoids, it is unclear whether the spontaneous developmental trajectory observed is representative of programmed early neurodevelopment. Although network activity from cortical organoids does not exhibit the full temporal complexity seen in adults, the pattern of alternating periods of quiescence and network-synchronized events resembles electrophysiological signatures present in preterm human infant EEG. During trace discontinu (Tolonen et al., 2007Tolonen M. Palva J.M. Andersson S. Vanhatalo S. Development of the spontaneous activity transients and ongoing cortical activity in human preterm babies.Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), quiescent periods are punctuated by high-amplitude oscillations (spontaneous activity transients [SATs]) lasting a few seconds. Intervals of complete quiescence disappear as infants become of term, and the EEG is dominated by continuous and low-amplitude desynchronized activity in adult brains (Figures 4A, S4A, and S4B). Due to the inability to interrogate the electrophysiology of intact human embryonic brains, we attempted to quantitatively compare network activity in cortical organoids to preterm human EEG.

https://openalex.org/W2970463661,"Clinical benefits of cytokine blockade in ileal Crohn's disease (iCD) are limited to a subset of patients. Here, we applied single-cell technologies to iCD lesions to address whether cellular heterogeneity contributes to treatment resistance. We found that a subset of patients expressed a unique cellular module in inflamed tissues that consisted of IgG plasma cells, inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes, activated T cells, and stromal cells, which we named the GIMATS module. Analysis of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identified a distinct network connectivity that likely drives the GIMATS module. Strikingly, the GIMATS module was also present in a subset of patients in four independent iCD cohorts (n = 441), and its presence at diagnosis correlated with failure to achieve durable corticosteroid-free remission upon anti-TNF therapy. These results emphasize the limitations of current diagnostic assays and the potential for single-cell mapping tools to identify novel biomarkers of treatment response and tailored therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2971361007,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells targeting CD19 demonstrate unparalleled responses in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)1-5, but toxicity, including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, limits broader application. Moreover, 40-60% of patients relapse owing to poor CAR T cell persistence or emergence of CD19- clones. Some factors, including the choice of single-chain spacer6 and extracellular7 and costimulatory domains8, have a profound effect on CAR T cell function and persistence. However, little is known about the impact of CAR binding affinity. There is evidence of a ceiling above which increased immunoreceptor affinity may adversely affect T cell responses9-11. We generated a novel CD19 CAR (CAT) with a lower affinity than FMC63, the high-affinity binder used in many clinical studies1-4. CAT CAR T cells showed increased proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro and had enhanced proliferative and in vivo antitumor activity compared with FMC63 CAR T cells. In a clinical study (CARPALL, NCT02443831 ), 12/14 patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with CAT CAR T cells achieved molecular remission. Persistence was demonstrated in 11 of 14 patients at last follow-up, with enhanced CAR T cell expansion compared with published data. Toxicity was low, with no severe CRS. One-year overall and event-free survival were 63% and 46%, respectively."

Phylogenetics and paleogenomics show genomic rearrangements across legumes and suggest a major role for repetitive elements in pea genome evolution. Compared to other sequenced Leguminosae genomes, the pea genome shows intense gene dynamics, most likely associated with genome size expansion when the Fabeae diverged from its sister tribes. During Pisum evolution, translocation and transposition differentially occurred across lineages. This reference sequence will accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of agronomically important traits and support crop improvement."

We have developed a method, Relate, scaling to >10,000 sequences while simultaneously estimating branch lengths, mutational ages and variable historical population sizes, as well as allowing for data errors. Application to 1,000 Genomes Project haplotypes produces joint genealogical histories for 26 human populations. Highly diverged lineages are present in all groups, but most frequent in Africa. Outside Africa, these mainly reflect ancient introgression from groups related to Neanderthals and Denisovans, while African signals instead reflect unknown events unique to that continent. Our approach allows more powerful inferences of natural selection than has previously been possible. We identify multiple regions under strong positive selection, and multi-allelic traits including hair color, body mass index and blood pressure, showing strong evidence of directional selection, varying among human groups."

However, we recently demonstrated that they can also induce transcriptome-wide guide-RNA-independent editing of RNA bases5, and created selective curbing of unwanted RNA editing (SECURE)-BE3 variants that have reduced unwanted RNA-editing activity5. Here we describe structure-guided engineering of SECURE-ABE variants with reduced off-target RNA-editing activity and comparable on-target DNA-editing activity that are also among the smallest Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 base editors described to date. We also tested CBEs with cytidine deaminases other than APOBEC1 and found that the human APOBEC3A-based CBE induces substantial editing of RNA bases, whereas an enhanced APOBEC3A-based CBE6, human activation-induced cytidine deaminase-based CBE7, and the Petromyzon marinus cytidine deaminase-based CBE Target-AID4 induce less editing of RNA. Finally, we found that CBEs and ABEs that exhibit RNA off-target editing activity can also self-edit their own transcripts, thereby leading to heterogeneity in base-editor coding sequences. Engineered variants of DNA base editors have reduced RNA off-target editing while retaining DNA on-target efficiency."

We attempted to predict gut microbiome α-diversity from ~1,000 blood analytes (laboratory tests, proteomics and metabolomics) in a cohort enrolled in a consumer wellness program (N = 399). Although 77 standard clinical laboratory tests and 263 plasma proteins could not accurately predict gut α-diversity, we found that 45% of the variance in α-diversity was explained by a subset of 40 plasma metabolites (13 of the 40 of microbial origin). The prediction capacity of these 40 metabolites was confirmed in a separate validation cohort (N = 540) and across disease states, showing that our findings are robust. Several of the metabolite biomarkers that are reported here are linked with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and kidney function. Associations between host metabolites and gut microbiome α-diversity were modified in those with extreme obesity (body mass index ≥ 35), suggesting metabolic perturbation. The ability of the blood metabolome to predict gut microbiome α-diversity could pave the way to the development of clinical tests for monitoring gut microbial health. Multiomics reveals that almost half of gut microbiome diversity in humans can be explained by 40 blood metabolites."

The microbiota is widely acknowledged as a central regulator of host health (Kundu et al., 2017Kundu P. Blacher E. Elinav E. Pettersson S.

However, the causal dynamics controlling these interactions are largely unknown. The biguanide metformin, a putative dietary restriction mimetic (Pryor and Cabreiro, 2015Pryor R. Cabreiro F. Repurposing metformin: an old drug with new tricks in its binding pockets.Biochem. J. 2015; 471: 307-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), is the most widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes. Unexpectedly, metformin treatment increases the survival of type 2 diabetic patients compared with matched healthy controls (Barzilai et al., 2016Barzilai N. Crandall J.P. Kritchevsky S.B.

The effects of metformin on host physiology are regulated by its interaction with the microbiota in an evolutionarily conserved manner, from C. elegans to humans (Bauer et al., 2018Bauer P.V.

For example, metformin treatment does not extend C. elegans lifespan in the absence of bacteria, when bacteria are metabolically impaired, or when bacteria develop resistance to the growth-inhibitory effects of metformin (Cabreiro et al., 2013Cabreiro F.

Nutrition also plays a key role in regulating both host and microbial physiology (David et al., 2014David L.A. Maurice C.F. Carmody R.N. Gootenberg D.B. Button J.E. Wolfe B.E. Ling A.V. Devlin A.S.

Malviya G. et al.Mannose impairs tumour growth and enhances chemotherapy.Nature. 2018; 563: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Indeed, the effects of metformin on host physiology are dependent on dietary intake (Bauer et al., 2018Bauer P.V. Duca F.A. Waise T.M.Z. Rasmussen B.A. Abraham M.A. Dranse H.J. Puri A. O’Brien C.A.

However, the precise mechanisms by which microbes regulate these effects in a nutrient-dependent manner remain elusive. Given the complexity of microbial metabolism and the myriad of metabolites of prokaryotic origin regulating host-related processes, understanding and harnessing their potential is a challenging task. Like humans, C. elegans hosts a community of gut microbes that acts as a central regulator of host physiology (Zhang et al., 2017Zhang F. Berg M. Dierking K. Félix M.A. Shapira M. Samuel B.S. Schulenburg H. Caenorhabditis elegans as a Model for Microbiome Research.Front. Microbiol. 2017; 8: 485PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, microbial metabolites of interest have been identified using animal models that allow direct high-throughput measurements of quantifiable and conserved host phenotypes that are directly regulated by microbes (Qi and Han, 2018Qi B.

Moreover, similar to the human microbiota, C. elegans is dominantly colonized by enterobacteria (Lloyd-Price et al., 2017Lloyd-Price J. Mahurkar A. Rahnavard G. Crabtree J. Orvis J. Hall A.B. Brady A. Creasy H.H. McCracken C.

Although many efforts have been made to develop techniques that further our understanding of the role of microbial genetics in host regulation, none exist to dissect the intricate relationships between nutrition, pharmacology, microbes, and host physiology. Here we devise a high-throughput four-way screening approach to facilitate the evaluation of nutritional modulation of drug action in the context of the host-microbe meta-organism. Using this strategy, we identify a bacterial signaling pathway that integrates metformin and nutrient signals to alter metabolite production by the microbiota. Changes in metabolite production can, in turn, affect fatty acid metabolism in the host, altering the lifespan. Importantly, using a computational modeling approach, we show that these changes in metabolite production are also recapitulated in the microbiota of metformin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, providing a potential explanation for the pro-longevity effects of metformin in humans. We hypothesized that changing the nutritional context might alter the effects of metformin on bacterial growth and, in turn, modulate the metabolic and longevity response of C. elegans to metformin. Because metformin induces a dietary restriction-like state in C. elegans to regulate the organismal lifespan (Onken and Driscoll, 2010Onken B. Driscoll M. Metformin induces a dietary restriction-like state and the oxidative stress response to extend C. elegans Healthspan via AMPK, LKB1, and SKN-1.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), we used the transgenic reporter C. elegans strain Pacs-2::GFP (Burkewitz et al., 2015Burkewitz K. Morantte I. Weir H.J.M. Yeo R. Zhang Y. Huynh F.K. Ilkayeva O.R. Hirschey M.D. Grant A.R. Mair W.B.

Acs-2 is an acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase ortholog that mediates the activation of fatty acids for β-oxidation in response to dietary restriction. As predicted, the ability of metformin to impair bacterial growth (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B), enhance host longevity (Figure 1B; Table S1), and increase the expression of Pacs-2::GFP (Figures 1C and S1C) varied dramatically according to metformin concentration. Critically, the magnitude of these effects differs depending on the growth medium, suggesting a nutritional input into this response (Figures 1B and 1C).Figure S1Four-Way Host-Microbe-Drug-Nutrient Screens Identify a Signaling Hub for the Integration of Drug and Nutrient Signals, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Bacterial growth of E. coli OP50 on different types of media with increasing concentrations of metformin.

To investigate how specific nutrients affect metformin action on the host in a bacterium-dependent way, we developed a high-throughput four-way host-microbe-drug-nutrient screen that allowed us to map these interactions at an extensive scale (Figure 1D; see STAR Methods for details). Briefly, we determined the propensity of 337 specific nutrients to modify the effect of metformin on bacterial growth. This provides a simple readout of nutrient-metformin interactions at the bacterial level. Similarly, measuring the expression levels of the Pacs-2::GFP C. elegans reporter line, we determined the propensity of these 337 nutrients to modify the dietary restriction-like transcriptional and metabolic response in the host induced by metformin in the presence of bacteria. This allowed us to identify nutrients that act in the host in the context of metformin in a bacterium-dependent and -independent manner (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1D; Table S2). Fold change values in the metformin-dependent Pacs-2::GFP fluorescence response of worms in the presence of specific nutrients (y axis) were plotted relative to the bacterial growth fold change values (x axis) for the same condition (Figure 1E). Although E. coli growth and C. elegans phenotype rescue by nutrients were not fully predictive of each other (r2 = 0.08, p = 1.1 × 10−7; Figures 1E and S1E–S1G), a large subset of the nutrient-bacterium interactions strongly predicted the effects of metformin on host physiology (Figure 1E, red circles). We observed that 37 of 79 nutrients that significantly rescued metformin-induced impairment of bacterial growth also suppressed Pacs-2::GFP activation by metformin in worms, and 25 nutrients that suppressed Pacs-2::GFP activation by metformin had either a neutral or synergistic interaction with the effects of metformin on bacterial growth (Figure S1H). Taken together, these data suggest specific nutritional tuning of metformin effects on host metabolism through the bacteria. Next we performed a nutrient EcoCyc metabolite class enrichment analysis on both the bacterial growth and Pacs-2::GFP host data (Figure 1F; Table S2) with the aim to identify nutrients that specifically rescue metformin effects on host physiology through the bacteria. From our metabolite enrichment analysis, nutrients belonging to the classes of amino sugars, peptides, amino acids (e.g., L-serine), and nucleotides (e.g., adenosine) significantly rescued the effects of metformin on bacterial growth without affecting the effects of metformin on host metabolism and lifespan (Figures 1E, 1F, S1I, S1J, S2A, and S2B). Conversely, carbohydrates, aldehydes, or carboxylates (e.g., D-glucose, D-ribose, and glycerol) rescued E. coli growth and abolished both the upregulation of Pacs-2::GFP and lifespan extension in worms in a bacterium-dependent manner, as demonstrated by the specific deletion of bacterial genes responsible for nutrient catabolism (Figures 1E, 1F, S1I, S1J, and S2C–S2L). This suggests the presence of specific processes in bacteria integrating the effects of nutrients and metformin to regulate host physiology. To identify these processes, we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ontology pathway analysis for both E. coli and C. elegans (Figure 1G; Table S2). This analysis revealed enrichment for the galactose and the phosphotransferase system (PTS) as key metabolic and signaling bacterial pathways, respectively, mediating the effects of metformin on the host. Altogether, our findings suggest a mechanism whereby the presence of specific metabolic and signaling pathways in bacteria function to integrate signals from both nutrition and drugs to regulate host metabolism. To better understand the mechanistic links between the metabolic and signaling pathways identified in our four-way screen and the regulation of host physiology, we performed proteomics analyses of E. coli with and without metformin treatment (Figure 2A). Metformin treatment was significantly associated with specific KEGG pathways, such as upregulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.0002) and downregulation of both glycolysis (FDR = 0.001) and arginine degradation via the arginine N-succinyltransferase (AST) pathway (FDR = 0.0006) (Figure 2B; Table S3). We also performed a functional analysis of these proteome changes using the E. coli gene-transcription factor links from the RegulonDB database to identify signaling regulators underlying these functional changes in the context of metformin. Eleven transcription factors (TFs) were found to be significantly associated with the bacterial response to metformin (STAR Methods; Table S3). Only four remained statistically significant following multiple comparisons adjustment: Crp (FDR = 0.025), Cra (FDR = 0.006), ArgR (FDR = 0.016), and NtrC (FDR = 0.025) (Figure 2B). We investigated the role of these 11 bacterial TFs in regulating the effects of metformin on bacterial growth, host metabolism, and lifespan. Deletion of the bacterial TFs did not confer resistance to metformin (Figures 2C; S3A, and S3B). Analysis of the effect of these bacterial TFs on host metabolism (Figures 2D; S3C, and S3D) and lifespan (Figures 2E, 2F, and S3E–S3N) revealed that deletion of bacterial Crp and ArgR significantly reduced the upregulation of worm Pacs-2::GFP (Figures 2D). In addition, bacterial Crp and ArgR are fully and partially required, respectively, for the increased host longevity induced by metformin (Figures 2E and 2F). Together, these data suggest that a bacterial signaling mechanism mediates the effects of metformin on host metabolism and lifespan. Therefore, we identified transcriptional regulators of metformin-E. coli effects on host physiology—a master regulator of carbon metabolism, Crp, and a master regulator of nitrogen metabolism, ArgR (Chubukov et al., 2014Chubukov V. Gerosa L. Kochanowski K. Sauer U. Coordination of microbial metabolism.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar)—through a mechanism that is independent of bacterial resistance to the effects of metformin on growth. Our four-way screen combined with our proteomics approach identified the bacterial PTS-Crp axis as a central regulator of metformin effects on the host. The PTS is a major active transport system in bacteria that coordinates the uptake of multiple carbohydrate molecules with the downstream regulation of Crp via a cascade of phosphorylation events. Consequently, Crp, together with its binding partner cyclic AMP (cAMP), directly controls the transcription of hundreds of genes in response to the nutritional environment and adjusts metabolic processes accordingly (Chubukov et al., 2014Chubukov V. Gerosa L. Kochanowski K. Sauer U. Coordination of microbial metabolism.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar; Figure 3A). We therefore conducted interventions designed to interrupt this signaling pathway at various steps. As expected, supplementation with glucose, a known inhibitor of bacterial cAMP-CRP signaling, reduced the effects of metformin on both the activation of Pacs-2::GFP in the host (Figures S4A and S4B) and lifespan extension (Figure 3B). Similarly, the use of bacterial mutants with deletions of multiple (ΔptsHΔptsIΔcrr) or single (Δcrr) PTS proteins or adenylate cyclase (ΔcyaA) also abolished the effects of metformin on longevity (Figures 3C, 3D, and S4C). All mutant bacterial strains tested were equally or more sensitive to metformin (Figures S4D and S4E). This further supports that this bacterial signaling pathway regulates the host lifespan in response to metformin via its downstream effects on metabolism rather than by conferring direct resistance to the drug, as shown previously for OP50-MR (Cabreiro et al., 2013Cabreiro F.

We applied this paradigm to probe the genetic circuitry that controls epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile epithelial cells undergoing a spontaneous spatially determined EMT in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor-β. Pseudospatial trajectory analysis identified continuous waves of gene regulation as opposed to discrete 'partial' stages of EMT. KRAS was connected to the exit from the epithelial state and the acquisition of a fully mesenchymal phenotype. A pooled single-cell CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified EMT-associated receptors and transcription factors, including regulators of KRAS, whose loss impeded progress along the EMT. Inhibiting the KRAS effector MEK and its upstream activators EGFR and MET demonstrates that interruption of key signaling events reveals regulatory 'checkpoints' in the EMT continuum that mimic discrete stages, and reconciles opposing views of the program that controls EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2971118426,"Necrosis of infected macrophages constitutes a critical pathogenetic event in tuberculosis by releasing mycobacteria into the growth-permissive extracellular environment. In zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium marinum or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, excess tumor necrosis factor triggers programmed necrosis of infected macrophages through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the participation of cyclophilin D, a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Here, we show that this necrosis pathway is not mitochondrion-intrinsic but results from an inter-organellar circuit initiating and culminating in the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ROS induce production of lysosomal ceramide that ultimately activates the cytosolic protein BAX. BAX promotes calcium flow from the endoplasmic reticulum into the mitochondrion through ryanodine receptors, and the resultant mitochondrial calcium overload triggers cyclophilin-D-mediated necrosis. We identify ryanodine receptors and plasma membrane L-type calcium channels as druggable targets to intercept mitochondrial calcium overload and necrosis of mycobacterium-infected zebrafish and human macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2970419481,"Summary Liver fibrosis is a very common condition seen in millions of patients with various liver diseases, and yet no effective treatments are available owing to poorly characterized molecular pathogenesis. Here, we show that leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) is a functional ligand of Tie1, a poorly characterized endothelial cell (EC)-specific orphan receptor. Upon binding to Tie1, LECT2 interrupts Tie1/Tie2 heterodimerization, facilitates Tie2/Tie2 homodimerization, activates PPAR signaling, and inhibits the migration and tube formations of EC. In vivo studies showed that LECT2 overexpression inhibits portal angiogenesis, promotes sinusoid capillarization, and worsens fibrosis, whereas these changes were reversed in Lect2-KO mice. Adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9)-LECT2 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) treatment significantly attenuates fibrosis. Upregulation of LECT2 is associated with advanced human liver fibrosis staging. We concluded that targeting LECT2/Tie1 signaling may represent a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis, and serum LECT2 level may be a potential biomarker for the screening and diagnosis of liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2970759956,"Although sensitizing processes occur earlier, schizophrenia is diagnosed in young adulthood, which suggests that it might involve a pathological transition during late brain development in predisposed individuals. Parvalbumin (PV) interneuron alterations have been noticed, but their role in the disease is unclear. Here we demonstrate that adult LgDel+/- mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia, exhibit PV neuron hypo-recruitment and associated chronic PV neuron plasticity together with network and cognitive deficits. All these deficits can be permanently rescued by chemogenetic activation of PV neurons or D2R antagonist treatments, specifically in the ventral hippocampus (vH) or medial-prefrontal cortex during a late-adolescence-sensitive time window. PV neuron alterations were initially restricted to the hippocampal CA1/subiculum, where they became responsive to treatment in late adolescence. Therefore, progression to disease in schizophrenia-model mice can be prevented by treatments supporting vH-mPFC PV network function during a sensitive time window late in adolescence, suggesting therapeutic strategies to prevent the outbreak of schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2972117407,"Mediterranean climates are characterized by strong seasonal contrasts between dry summers and wet winters. Changes in winter rainfall are critical for regional socioeconomic development, but are difficult to simulate accurately1 and reconstruct on Quaternary timescales. This is partly because regional hydroclimate records that cover multiple glacial–interglacial cycles2,3 with different orbital geometries, global ice volume and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are scarce. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of change and their persistence remain unexplored. Here we show that, over the past 1.36 million years, wet winters in the northcentral Mediterranean tend to occur with high contrasts in local, seasonal insolation and a vigorous African summer monsoon. Our proxy time series from Lake Ohrid on the Balkan Peninsula, together with a 784,000-year transient climate model hindcast, suggest that increased sea surface temperatures amplify local cyclone development and refuel North Atlantic low-pressure systems that enter the Mediterranean during phases of low continental ice volume and high concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. A comparison with modern reanalysis data shows that current drivers of the amount of rainfall in the Mediterranean share some similarities to those that drive the reconstructed increases in precipitation. Our data cover multiple insolation maxima and are therefore an important benchmark for testing climate model performance. Comparisons between past regional drivers of precipitation extremes found time series data from Lake Ohrid and modern climate models of the Mediterranean may help to reduce simulation uncertainties in predictions of the Mediterranean climate."
https://openalex.org/W2970142068,"The vast majority of human mutations have minor allele frequencies under 1%, with the plurality observed only once (that is, ‘singletons’). While Mendelian diseases are predominantly caused by rare alleles, their cumulative contribution to complex phenotypes is largely unknown. We develop and rigorously validate an approach to jointly estimate the contribution of all alleles, including singletons, to phenotypic variation. We apply our approach to transcriptional regulation, an intermediate between genetic variation and complex disease. Using whole-genome DNA and lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data from 360 European individuals, we conservatively estimate that singletons contribute approximately 25% of cis heritability across genes (dwarfing the contributions of other frequencies). The majority (approximately 76%) of singleton heritability derives from ultrarare variants absent from thousands of additional samples. We develop an inference procedure to demonstrate that our results are consistent with pervasive purifying selection shaping the regulatory architecture of most human genes. An approach to estimate the contribution of all alleles to phenotypic variation is applied to transcription regulation using whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome data. Ultrarare variants contribute approximately 46% of cis heritability across genes."

Anti-CRISPR proteins display no common features with respect to the sequence, predicted structure, or genomic location of the genes encoding them. However, anti-CRISPR genes are almost invariably found upstream of a gene encoding a protein containing a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain (Figure 1). Seven different families of genes encoding these HTH-containing proteins have been designated anti-CRISPR-associated (aca). Members of the aca gene families have been identified in phages, prophages, plasmids, and conjugative elements in diverse bacterial species (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013Bondy-Denomy J. Pawluk A.

Microbiol. 2016; 1: 16085Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and implies that they play an important role in anti-CRISPR systems. Nevertheless, their function remains unknown. The goal of this work was to define the role of aca genes in anti-CRISPR biology. We investigated aca gene function using Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage JBD30 as our primary model system (Figure 1). This phage was among the first set of phages shown to use an anti-CRISPR gene for survival in the presence of CRISPR-Cas (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013Bondy-Denomy J. Pawluk A. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system.Nature. 2013; 493: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The anti-CRISPR operon of JBD30 and other closely related phages is located between operons encoding phage structural proteins. In JBD30, a single anti-CRISPR (acr) gene, acrIF1, is followed directly by an aca gene known as aca1. Aca1 is conserved (>50% identity) among diverse anti-CRISPR-encoding phages and prophages in Pseudomonas species (Pawluk et al., 2016bPawluk A. Staals R.H. Taylor C. Watson B.N. Saha S. Fineran P.C. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Inactivation of CRISPR-Cas systems by anti-CRISPR proteins in diverse bacterial species.Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1: 16085Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because Aca1 possesses a HTH DNA-binding motif, we reasoned that it might be involved in regulating anti-CRISPR gene transcription. To address this, we investigated the transcript levels of the acrIF1 gene of JBD30 throughout its infection cycle. We found that anti-CRISPR transcription occurs at a high level early in the phage infection process and that Aca1 represses this transcription. Remarkably, we found that the repressor activity of Aca1 is essential for phage survival irrespective of CRISPR-Cas. We also showed that other Aca protein families act as repressors of anti-CRISPR transcription. This crucial function of Aca likely explains its ubiquity in anti-CRISPR operons. To investigate the potential role of Aca1 in regulating acr transcription, we first evaluated the dynamics of anti-CRISPR gene expression over the course of phage infection in P. aeruginosa strain PA14, which encodes a type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. A lysate of phage JBD30 was mixed with PA14, and samples were removed at successive time points after phage addition. By extracting RNA from these samples, which span the lytic cycle of JBD30 (∼70 min; Figure S1) and quantifying the level of anti-CRISPR acrIF1 transcripts using qRT-PCR, we found that acrIF1 transcription was easily detectable within 6 min after infection (Figure 2A). There was a more than 100-fold increase in the level of anti-CRISPR transcripts within the first 20 min of infection. Remarkably, acrIF1 transcription initiated earlier and at a considerably higher level than that of the transposase gene (A), which is expected to be one of the first genes transcribed in JBD30. JBD30 is very similar to the well-characterized E. coli phage Mu in its genome organization and composition, placing it in the Mu-like phage family. The transposase is expressed early in infection because it is required for the first step in the life cycle of Mu-like phages, which involves transposition of the phage genome into that of the host (Marrs and Howe, 1990Marrs C.F. Howe M.M. Kinetics and regulation of transcription of bacteriophage Mu.Virology. 1990; 174: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, by comparison with phage Mu, we expected transcription of gene G, a gene required for phage morphogenesis located directly upstream of the acrIF1 gene, to increase late in the infection process. In accord with this expectation, the G transcript did not accumulate to appreciable levels until 50 min after phage addition. Overall, these data show that acrIF1 transcription is very high early in the infection process, presumably allowing the anti-CRISPR protein to accumulate sufficiently to inhibit the pre-formed CRISPR-Cas complexes present in the cell.Figure 2acrIF1 Expression Is Driven by a Promoter Region that Includes Binding Sites for Aca1Show full caption(A) Relative transcription levels of phage genes were measured by qRT-PCR at the indicated times after infection of PA14 by phage JBD30.

See also Figures S1 and S2. The distinct transcription profile of the acrIF1 gene implied that it possessed its own promoter. A DNA sequence alignment of the region upstream of diverse acr genes from phages related to JBD30 revealed a conserved predicted promoter (Figure 2B). This region from phage JBD30 was cloned upstream of a promoterless lacZ reporter gene carried on a plasmid. The presence of the putative acrIF1 promoter increased β-galactosidase activity by approximately 15-fold compared with the control lacking a promoter, demonstrating that this DNA sequence can direct robust transcription in P. aeruginosa (Figure 2C). To confirm that this promoter was responsible for anti-CRISPR gene expression during phage infection, we created a JBD30 mutant phage (JBD30ΔPacr) lacking this region. In a plaquing assay, the JBD30ΔPacr mutant phage replicated robustly on PA14 lacking a functional CRISPR-Cas system (PA14ΔCRISPR), but in the presence of CRISPR-Cas, phage replication was equivalent to that of a JBD30 mutant bearing a frameshift mutation in acrIF1 (acrfs) (Figure 2D). These data imply that the identified promoter drives acrIF1 transcription during infection. Aca1 proteins are bioinformatically predicted to contain a HTH DNA-binding motif (Figure S2A). HTH-containing proteins are generally dimeric and bind to inverted repeat sequences (Luscombe et al., 2000Luscombe N.M. Austin S.E. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. An overview of the structures of protein-DNA complexes.Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (REVIEWS001)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified two such sites with very similar sequences, to which we refer as inverted repeat 1 (IR1) and inverted repeat 2 (IR2). IR1 lies upstream of the −35 region of the acrIF1 promoter, and IR2 lies between the −35 and −10 regions (Figure 2B). To determine whether Aca1 could bind to the acr promoter region, purified Aca1 was mixed with a 110-bp dsDNA fragment containing the acr promoter, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed. Incubation of the promoter-containing fragment with Aca1 resulted in a concentration-dependent shift in the mobility of the fragment, which was not observed with a non-specific DNA sequence (Figure S2B). At higher Aca1 concentrations, a second shifted band was observed, consistent with the presence of two Aca1 binding sites within this fragment. The KD of this interaction was approximately 50 nM (Figure S2C). This KD value is 10- to 100-fold weaker than those of other well-known HTH-containing proteins (Gilbert and Müller-Hill, 1967Gilbert W. Müller-Hill B. The lac operator is DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1967; 58: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Kamionka et al., 2004Kamionka A. Bogdanska-Urbaniak J. Scholz O. Hillen W.

Lambda repressor mutations that increase the affinity and specificity of operator binding.Cell. 1985; 42: 549-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A 53-bp fragment encompassing only IR1 and IR2 of the acr promoter was also bound by Aca1 and displayed two shifted bands by EMSA (Figure 2E). To determine whether the two shifted bands represented Aca1 binding at both IR1 and IR2 sites, point mutations were introduced into each inverted repeat to abolish their symmetry. Fragments bearing mutations in either IR1 or IR2 still bound to Aca1, but only a single shifted band was observed, whereas no shift was observed with a fragment bearing mutations in both sites. These results demonstrated that Aca1 binds the acrIF1 promoter at both the IR1 and IR2 sites. Given the binding of Aca1 to the acrIF1 promoter and the position of IR1 relative to the core promoter elements, we speculated that Aca1 might contribute to the strong transcription of the anti-CRISPR gene early in infection. To determine whether Aca1 binding to the acrIF1 promoter modulates its transcriptional activity, we measured the activity of this promoter in the presence of Aca1 using the lacZ reporter assay described above. Contrary to our expectation, the presence of Aca1 led to a 5-fold reduction in β-galactosidase reporter activity (Figure 2F). The repressive activity of Aca1 depended on the presence of an intact IR2 site, suggesting that this site is active in vivo. By contrast, the IR1 site was not required for repression despite being bound by Aca1 in vitro. The in vivo function of the Aca1 binding sites in the acrIF1 promoter were assessed by crossing the inverted repeat mutations into phage JBD30 through in vivo recombination (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013Bondy-Denomy J. Pawluk A. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system.Nature. 2013; 493: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Despite the marked effect of the IR1 and IR2 mutations on Aca1 DNA binding in vitro, introduction of these mutations into the phage genome caused no significant decrease in the viability of the mutant phages on either PA14 or PA14ΔCRISPR (Figure 2G). To further investigate the role of Aca1 DNA-binding activity, we introduced amino acid substitutions within the putative HTH region of Aca1 that were expected to reduce DNA binding Figures S2A and S2D). Substitutions with Ala at Arg33 or Arg34 and an Arg33/Arg34 double mutant each partially reduced the DNA-binding activity of Aca1 in vitro, whereas substituting Arg44, which is predicted to be in the major groove recognition helix, completely abolished Aca1 DNA binding (Figure 3A). The DNA-binding activity of these mutants was also measured using the lacZ reporter assay. Consistent with the in vitro data, the R44A mutant displayed very little repressor activity on the acrIF1 promoter (Figure 3B). The activity of the R33A/R34A double mutant was intermediate between the R44A mutant and the R33A and R34A single mutants, corroborating the in vitro changes in DNA-binding activity observed for these mutants. The Aca1 DNA-binding mutants were subsequently crossed into phage JBD30. Unexpectedly, we were able to isolate phages carrying the mutations affecting Arg33 and Arg34 but not the mutation affecting Arg44. The R44A mutant phage could only be obtained by plating on cells expressing wild-type Aca1 from a plasmid, suggesting that the Aca1 DNA-binding activity is essential for phage viability. Using high-titer lysates of JBD30aca1R44A produced in the presence of Aca1, we discovered that this phage was unable to replicate (titer reduced more than 106-fold) on PA14 or PA14ΔCRISPR (Figure 3C). By contrast, the mutant phages encoding Aca1 substitutions at the Arg33 or Arg34 positions formed plaques at levels approaching that of the wild-type phage (Figure S3A). These data demonstrate that intermediate reductions of Aca1 DNA-binding activity have little effect on phage viability but that complete loss of Aca1 DNA-binding activity is lethal. Although the JBD30aca1R44A phage replicated very poorly on the PA14ΔCRISPR strain, plating high concentrations of this phage did lead to the appearance of revertant plaques at a low frequency (<1 × 10−6"
https://openalex.org/W2971578544,"Pseudouridine (Ψ) is a post-transcriptional RNA modification that alters RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that affect gene expression. Messenger RNA pseudouridylation was recently discovered as a widespread and conserved phenomenon, but the mechanisms responsible for selective, regulated pseudouridylation of specific sequences within mRNAs were unknown. Here, we have revealed mRNA targets for five pseudouridine synthases and probed the determinants of mRNA target recognition by the predominant mRNA pseudouridylating enzyme, Pus1, by developing high-throughput kinetic analysis of pseudouridylation in vitro. Combining computational prediction and rational mutational analysis revealed an RNA structural motif that is both necessary and sufficient for mRNA pseudouridylation. Applying this structural context information predicted hundreds of additional mRNA targets that were pseudouridylated in vivo. These results demonstrate a structure-dependent mode of mRNA target recognition by a conserved pseudouridine synthase and implicate modulation of RNA structure as the probable mechanism to regulate mRNA pseudouridylation."

How need and motivation control the decision to continue or change behavior is not understood. Using a single fly treadmill, we show that hungry flies persistently track a food odor and increase their effort over repeated trials in the absence of reward suggesting that need dominates negative experience. We further show that odor tracking is regulated by two mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) connecting the MB to the lateral horn. These MBONs, together with dopaminergic neurons and Dop1R2 signaling, control behavioral persistence. Conversely, an octopaminergic neuron, VPM4, which directly innervates one of the MBONs, acts as a brake on odor tracking by connecting feeding and olfaction. Together, our data suggest a function for the MB in internal state-dependent expression of behavior that can be suppressed by external inputs conveying a competing behavioral drive."

Numerous studies have focused on the physiological and pathological functions of ZNT1. However, its biochemical features remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the regulation of ZNT1 expression in human and vertebrate cells, and found that ZNT1 expression is posttranslationally regulated by cellular zinc status. We observed that under zinc-sufficient conditions, ZNT1 accumulates on the plasma membrane, consistent with its zinc efflux function. In contrast, under zinc-deficient conditions, ZNT1 molecules on the plasma membrane were endocytosed and degraded through both the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Zinc-responsive ZNT1 expression corresponded with that of metallothionein, supporting the idea that ZNT1 and metallothionein cooperatively regulate cellular zinc homeostasis. ZNT1 is N-glycosylated on Asn299 in the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains V and VI, and this appears to be involved in the regulation of ZNT1 stability, as nonglycosylated ZNT1 is more stable. However, this posttranslational modification had no effect on ZNT1's ability to confer cellular resistance against high zinc levels or its subcellular localization. Our results provide molecular insights into ZNT1-mediated regulation of cellular zinc homeostasis, and indicate that the control of cellular and systemic zinc homeostasis via dynamic regulation of ZNT1 expression is more sophisticated than previously thought.

Dey S.K. Palmiter R.D.

In enterocytes, ZNT1 is located on the basolateral membrane, so probably facilitates zinc absorption by exporting it into portal blood (6Yu Y.Y. Kirschke C.P. Huang L.

In addition to its functions as a zinc exporter, ZNT1 also plays regulatory roles, most of which are related to protein-protein interactions with ZNT1 in intracellular compartments. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ZNT1 interacts with the β-subunit of the L-type calcium channel, which leads to a reduction in the cell surface expression of its pore-forming α1-subunit (21Levy S. Beharier O. Etzion Y. Mor M. Buzaglo L. Shaltiel L. Gheber L.A. Kahn J. Muslin A.J. Katz A. Gitler D. Moran A.

Moreover, its interaction with EVER proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of Epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which is a rare autosomal recessive skin disease (OMIM 226400) (22Lazarczyk M. Pons C. Mendoza J.A. Cassonnet P. Jacob Y. Favre M. Regulation of cellular zinc balance as a potential mechanism of EVER-mediated protection against pathogenesis by cutaneous oncogenic human papillomaviruses.J. Exp.

Taken together, these observations clearly highlight ZNT1’s importance in cellular and systemic homeostatic control. However, the molecular feature of ZNT1 is relatively unknown. A well-known molecular feature of ZNT1 is that it is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to high zinc levels, and this is mediated through the binding of metal-response element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) to the metal-response elements in its promoter region (23Langmade S.J. Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. The transcription factor MTF-1 mediates metal regulation of the mouse ZnT1 gene.J. Biol.

This transcriptional regulation in response to high zinc levels is similar to that of metallothionein (MT), which is also a target gene of MTF-1. However, other features of ZNT1 expression regulation still remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular features and expression regulation of ZNT1 in human and vertebrate cells using an anti-ZNT1 mAb that we generated in previous studies (26Nishito Y.

We first confirmed whether our anti-ZNT1 mAb, which was generated against the C-terminal cytosolic portion of the protein, specifically detects ZNT1 using an N-terminally FLAG-tagged ZNT1 (FLAG-ZNT1) protein, because it detected ZNT1 at a greater molecular size than that calculated based on its cDNA in our previous study (26Nishito Y.

We conducted two experiments to investigate whether the presence of two bands may have been caused by variations in glycosylation. First, we treated a cell lysate prepared from znt1−/−mt−/−znt4−/− cells overexpressing FLAG-ZNT1 with PNGase F, which hydrolyzes all types of N-linked oligosaccharide structures. The PNGase F treatment shifted the ∼75 kDa band of ZNT1 to ∼63 kDa, indicating that the higher band is the N-glycosylated form of ZNT1 (Fig. 1B, lane 4). The ∼63 kDa band was still higher than 55.3 kDa, the expected molecular mass of ZNT1, which could be attributed to the properties of the cytosolic histidine-rich loop. Second, because ZNT1 has a consensus motif for N-glycosylation (Asn299–Ser300–Thr301) in extracellular loop 3 (EL3) between transmembrane domains V and VI, we constructed a nonglycosylated ZNT1 mutant in which the 299th Asn residue (Asn299) was substituted with an Ala residue (ZNT1N299A). Immunoblotting of ZNT1N299A only showed the ∼63 kDa band (Fig. 1B, lane 5), clearly indicating that ZNT1 is N-glycosylated at Asn299. Then, we investigated the effect of N-glycosylation at Asn299 on ZNT1 functions, specifically its subcellular localization and ability to tolerate high zinc concentrations. The cell surface localization of the ZNT1N299A mutant was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1C, upper panels) and a cell surface biotinylation assay (Fig. 1C, lower panels), indicating that N-glycosylation at Asn299 is unimportant for the subcellular localization of ZNT1. Because our previous results demonstrated that znt1−/−mt−/−znt4−/− cells can be used to evaluate ZNT1 zinc transport ability (27Fujimoto S. Itsumura N. Tsuji T. Anan Y. Tsuji N. Ogra Y. Kimura T.

The ZNT1N299A mutant conferred resistance to znt1−/−mt−/−znt4−/− cells against high zinc concentrations, comparable with that of wildtype (WT) ZNT1 (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that N-glycosylation is unimportant in terms of ZNT1’s ability to traffic to the cell surface or to confer cellular resistance against high zinc levels. Previous studies have revealed that ZNT1 plays crucial roles in reducing zinc toxicity when overexpressed (11Palmiter R.D. Huang L.

We characterized ZNT1 using cultured human cells, in which the ZNT1 gene was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. The loss of ZNT1 in chronic myelogenous leukemia haploid HAP1 or pancreatic cancer PANC1 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting using our anti-ZNT1 mAb (Fig. 2, A and B). The results of the genome editing were confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing (Fig. S1). In ZNT1-deficient cells, MT protein expression was significantly increased compared with that in WT cells (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the loss of ZNT1 increases the cytosolic zinc contents. Treating the total cellular lysates with PNGase F shifted the ∼75 kDa band of endogenous ZNT1 to the ∼63 kDa band (Fig. 2, C and D), similar to the above experiment, confirming that endogenous ZNT1 is also N-glycosylated. The re-expression of ZNT1 in ZNT1-deficient PANC1 cells decreased MT induction to the basal level found in WT PANC1 cells but did neither by the expression of ZNT1H43N and ZNT1H43A mutants (Fig. 2E), both of which had lost their zinc transport ability, as described previously (26Nishito Y.

Consistent with these results, ZNT1 re-expression conferred resistance against high zinc concentrations but both the mutants did not (Fig. 2F).

The cell surface biotinylation assay and Z-stack analysis of the immunofluorescence microscopy results revealed that endogenous ZNT1 was located on the basolateral membrane in polarized Caco2 cells (Fig. 2, G and H) and was N-glycosylated, indicating that N-glycosylation is a general modification of the ZNT1 protein (Fig. 2I).

Consistent with the increase in its mRNA expression, the expression of the ZNT1 protein also increased (Fig. 3B), but the time course of these increases during ZnSO4 treatment differed. The ZNT1 expression at the protein level increased gradually up to 12 h, whereas its expression at the mRNA level increased for up to 3 h and decreased in 6 h. Therefore, we examined the expression of the ZNT1 protein at the post-translational level in more detail. ZNT1 protein expression was increased in HepG2 cells by low levels of zinc supplementation (20 μm ZnSO4; Fig. 3C) and in response to increases in zinc concentration (Fig. 3D).

The cell surface biotinylation assay of HepG2 cells revealed that ZNT1 accumulation on the plasma membrane increased in response to increased zinc (Fig. 3G), consistent with its zinc-efflux function. We then examined the possibility that ZNT1 accumulation on the plasma membrane was directly facilitated by increased zinc, not just by increases in translation following its transcriptional up-regulation in response to increases in zinc. We used mtf-1 knockout (mtf-1 KO) MEF cells, because we assumed that the effects of zinc on ZNT1 cell surface accumulation are directly evaluated in mtf-1 KO MEF cells, which have lost cellular responses to high zinc toxicity through up-regulating the transcription of a set of zinc-responsive genes, such as MT and ZNT1 (31Laity J.H.

While glutamate receptors are best known to transmit chemical synaptic signals in the CNS, we show that GLR-3 senses cold in the peripheral sensory neuron ASER to trigger cold-avoidance behavior. GLR-3 transmits cold signals via G protein signaling independently of its glutamate-gated channel function, suggesting GLR-3 as a metabotropic cold receptor. The vertebrate GLR-3 homolog GluK2 from zebrafish, mouse, and human can all function as a cold receptor in heterologous systems. Mouse DRG sensory neurons express GluK2, and GluK2 knockdown in these neurons suppresses their sensitivity to cold but not cool temperatures.

An understanding of the regulatory mechanism for sleep lays at the foundation for healthy living and aging. Sleep behavior has long been thought to be regulated by the interactions of circadian clock and sleep homeostasis pathways (Borbély, 1982Borbély A.A. A two process model of sleep regulation.Hum. Neurobiol. 1982; 1: 195-204Google Scholar, Borbély et al., 2016Borbély A.A. Daan S. Wirz-Justice A. Deboer T. The two-process model of sleep regulation: a reappraisal.J.

Physiol. 1984; 246: R161-R183Google Scholar). In humans, variations of genetically inherited sleep features in the population have been recognized for a long time (Sehgal and Mignot, 2011Sehgal A. Mignot E. Genetics of sleep and sleep disorders.Cell. 2011; 146: 194-207Google Scholar, Shi et al., 2017Shi G. Wu D. Ptáček L.J. Fu Y.-H. Human genetics and sleep behavior.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 44: 43-49Google Scholar). Importantly, human sleep has unique features that are different from that of animal models. For example, human sleep is usually consolidated, whereas mice sleep throughout the 24-h day (though more in the light phase than in the dark phase). Drosophila sleep-like behavior is consolidated into one long period, but the level of similarity between the Drosophila and human molecular regulatory mechanisms remains unclear. Previously, we identified a series of genetic variations that influence the timing of sleep in humans, and mouse models of these mutations mostly recapitulate the phenotypes (Shi et al., 2017Shi G. Wu D. Ptáček L.J. Fu Y.-H. Human genetics and sleep behavior.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 44: 43-49Google Scholar). Timing of sleep is heavily influenced by the circadian clock, which has been intensely studied, and we now have a large and growing body of knowledge on how the clock is regulated at the molecular level. On the other hand, our understanding of sleep homeostasis regulation for human lags behind. We reported a mutation in the human DEC2 gene that causes mutation carriers to sleep 6 h nightly for their entire lives without apparent negative effects (He et al., 2009He Y. Jones C.R. Fujiki N. Xu Y. Guo B. Holder J.L. Rossner M.J. Nishino S. Fu Y.H. The transcriptional repressor DEC2 regulates sleep length in mammals.Science. 2009; 325: 866-870Google Scholar). Another mutation in DEC2 was later reported in a single individual who is a short sleeper and resistant to sleep deprivation (Pellegrino et al., 2014Pellegrino R. Kavakli I.H. Goel N. Cardinale C.J.

Hogenesch J.B. et al.A novel BHLHE41 variant is associated with short sleep and resistance to sleep deprivation in humans.Sleep (Basel). 2014; 37: 1327-1336Google Scholar). Identification of additional genes participating in modulation of human sleep duration provides a unique way to expand our knowledge of genes and pathways critical for human sleep homeostasis regulation. Noradrenergic signaling in the CNS has long been known to regulate sleep (Berridge, 2008Berridge C.W. Noradrenergic modulation of arousal.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 58: 1-17Google Scholar, Berridge et al., 2012Berridge C.W. Schmeichel B.E. España R.A. Noradrenergic modulation of wakefulness/arousal.Sleep Med. Rev. 2012; 16: 187-197Google Scholar, Szabadi, 2013Szabadi E. Functional neuroanatomy of the central noradrenergic system.J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2013; 27: 659-693Google Scholar). The network involving the noradrenergic neurons has been extensively studied, and most of the receptor subtypes have been genetically defined. In contrast to α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors (ARs), relatively little is known about the function of β receptors in the CNS (Berridge et al., 2012Berridge C.W. Schmeichel B.E. España R.A. Noradrenergic modulation of wakefulness/arousal.Sleep Med. Rev. 2012; 16: 187-197Google Scholar, Szabadi, 2013Szabadi E. Functional neuroanatomy of the central noradrenergic system.J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2013; 27: 659-693Google Scholar). βARs within the brain were previously suggested to mediate the effect of norepinephrine (NE) for alert waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (Berridge et al., 2012Berridge C.W. Schmeichel B.E. España R.A. Noradrenergic modulation of wakefulness/arousal.Sleep Med. Rev. 2012; 16: 187-197Google Scholar). Clinically, β-blockers are widely used and can be associated with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, possibly due to reduced production and release of melatonin (Helfand et al., 2009Helfand M. Peterson K. Christensen V. Dana T. Thakurata S. Drug Class Review: Beta Adrenergic Blockers. Oregon Health & Science University, 2009: 1-616Google Scholar, Scheer et al., 2012Scheer F.A.J.L.

We report here a rare mutation in the β1AR gene (ADRB1) found in humans with natural short sleep. Engineering the human mutation into mice resulted in a sleep phenotype similar to that seen in familial natural short sleepers. We show that β1AR is expressed at high levels in the dorsal pons (DP). Neuronal activity measured by calcium imaging in this region demonstrated that ADRB1+ neurons in DP are wake and REM sleep active. Manipulating the activity of these ADRB1+ neurons changes sleep/wake patterns. Also, the activity of these neurons was altered in mice harboring the mutation. Together, these results not only support the causative role of this ADRB1 mutation in the human subjects but also provide a mechanism for investigating noradrenaline and β1AR in sleep regulation at the circuit level. We searched for genes that are important in sleep regulation by screening for mutations in human individuals who exhibit unusual sleep patterns. Natural short sleep (NSS) refers to individuals who have a lifelong tendency to sleep only 4–6 h per night and feel well rested (He et al., 2009He Y. Jones C.R. Fujiki N. Xu Y. Guo B. Holder J.L. Rossner M.J. Nishino S. Fu Y.H. The transcriptional repressor DEC2 regulates sleep length in mammals.Science. 2009; 325: 866-870Google Scholar). Kindred 50025 is a family segregating an autosomal dominant allele for familial natural short sleep (FNSS) (Figure 1A; Table S1). SNP-based linkage analysis followed by whole-exome sequencing identified a very rare variant in the ADRB1 gene, located on chromosome 10q25.3. The mutation co-segregates with FNSS in the family and involves a C→T change in the coding sequence that is predicted to cause an alanine→valine alteration at amino acid position 187 of the β1AR. This change was not found in the unaffected members of the same family. In the human population, this is a rare mutation, with an incidence of 4.028/100,000 according to the Exome Aggregation Consortium database. The alanine at position 187 of β1AR (A187) is highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates (Figure 1B). Notably, β1AR is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that has seven transmembrane domains. The A187 residue is located in the 4th transmembrane domain. To gain insight into whether this mutation has functional consequences, we first compared the mutant versus wild-type (WT) protein in cultured cells. As shown in Figure 2A, the mutant protein was less stable than the WT protein in a cycloheximide (CHX) assay. Because β1AR mediates the catecholamine-induced activation of adenylatecyclase (thus cyclic AMP [cAMP]-mediated signaling), we next examined the effect of the mutation on the synthesis of cAMP. To mimic the situation of human carriers, we transfected the cells with a mixture (1:1) of WT and mutant β1AR. We found that heterozygous expression of the receptors led to decreased cAMP production in response to treatment with the nonselective agonist isoproterenol compared to expression of WT receptor alone (Figure 2B). This result indicates that the mutant protein likely has altered function. We thus generated an Adrb1-A187V knockin mouse model using CRISPR/Cas9. Endogenous β1AR levels were decreased significantly in the mutant (Adrb1 +/m) mice (Figures 2C and 2D), whereas mRNA levels remained unchanged (Figures 2E and 2F), suggesting the decreased protein levels were caused by post-transcriptional events. This is consistent with the finding that the mutant protein is less stable than the WT protein in the CHX assay in cultured cells (Figure 2A). To determine whether this mutation has any influence on sleep-related behaviors, we measured the sleep/wake behavior by two independent methods: ANY-maze (locomotor activity monitored by infrared cameras) and electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG). The mutant (Adrb1 +/m) mice showed increased activity by ANY-maze as reflected by more mobile time during the 24 h day (Figure 3A). The increased mobile time in the mutant mice was observed in both the light and dark phases (Figures 3B and 3C). In parallel, total sleep time within 24 h was ∼55 min shorter in the mutant mice when measured by EEG/EMG (Figure 3D), and this decrease was only seen in the dark phase (Figures 3E, 3F, and S1A). The short-sleep phenotype of these mice is also demonstrated by the significant shortening of both non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep in the dark phase for Adrb1 +/m mice when compared to WT mice. NREM sleep was ∼53 min less and REM sleep was ∼7 min less in the Adrb1 +/m versus WT mice during the dark phase (Figures 3G–3L, S1B, and S1C). The decreased NREM and REM sleep was due to the reduction of sleep bouts rather than episode duration (Figures S1D–S1G). These results indicated that the Adrb1 A187V mutation can lead to short sleep and increased mobile time, similar to what we observe in the human subjects. Since sleep pressure positively correlates with delta power (the 1–4.0 Hz frequency range of the EEG during NREM sleep) (Franken et al., 2001Franken P. Chollet D. Tafti M. The homeostatic regulation of sleep need is under genetic control.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2610-2621Google Scholar), we examined changes in the NREM EEG delta power during the light phase (see STAR Methods). The delta power of the mutant mice was significantly higher at the beginning (ZT1–2) and decreased rapidly throughout the light phase when compared to WT mice (Figure 3M). These data suggested that the Adrb1 mutant mice accumulate more sleep pressure, probably due to the shorter sleep in the dark phase. We next generated ADRB1-Cre bacterial artificial chromosome/clone (BAC) transgenic mice in order to study neural activity of ADRB1+ cells and their possible role in sleep regulation. A large BAC construct (150 kb) containing the entire ADRB1 locus was modified so that the coding sequence of ADRB1 was replaced by that of Cre recombinase (Figure 4A) (Gong et al., 2003Gong S. Zheng C. Doughty M.L. Losos K. Didkovsky N. Schambra U.B. Nowak N.J. Joyner A. Leblanc G. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Google Scholar). The transgenic mice were crossed with two different reporter lines, ROSA mT/mG (Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Google Scholar) and Ai32 (loxP-flanked-ChR2-EYFP). We sectioned the whole brain to identify cells positive for the reporters. There was good agreement between the two reporter lines, and several regions were found to have high CRE activity, including hippocampus, lateral septal nucleus, medial prefrontal cortex, DP (Figures 4B and 4C), and various structures in the medulla (Figure S2). The DP region contains the major portions of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus ventral (LDTgV), and part of parabrachial nucleus (PB), regions that are known to be involved in regulation of sleep behaviors (Figure S3A) (Boissard et al., 2002Boissard R.

Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1959-1973Google Scholar, Cox et al., 2016Cox J. Pinto L. Dan Y. Calcium imaging of sleep-wake related neuronal activity in the dorsal pons.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10763Google Scholar, Fuller et al., 2011Fuller P.M. Sherman D. Pedersen N.P. Saper C.B. Lu J. Reassessment of the structural basis of the ascending arousal system.J. Comp. Neurol. 2011; 519: 933-956Google Scholar). We thus focused our attention on the DP. We injected the Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding EGFP (AAV2/EF1a-DIO-EGFP-L10a) into this area and stained the brain sections with probes against endogenous Adrb1 and gfp. Approximately 80% of the GFP-positive cells also stained positively for Adrb1 (Figure S3B). Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) of mRNA populations in CRE-expressing cells in DP also showed ∼3- to 4-fold enrichment of endogenous Adrb1 (Figures S3C and S3D) compared to control genes. Taken together, these results indicate that the Cre activity largely represents Adrb1 expression in this region. Since DP contains different populations of neurons (Kohlmeier and Kristiansen, 2010Kohlmeier K.A. Kristiansen U. GABAergic actions on cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental neurons: implications for control of behavioral state.Neuroscience. 2010; 171: 812-829Google Scholar, Wang and Morales, 2009Wang H.L. Morales M. Pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei contain distinct populations of cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the rat.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 340-358Google Scholar), we then labeled the DP ADRB1+ neurons by injecting the virus AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (mCherry hereafter). Co-staining revealed that the ADRB1+ cells in the DP were glutamatergic (∼37%, 221/600) or GABAergic (∼25%, 150/600) based on the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) or glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1), respectively (Figures S4A–S4F). There were very few cholinergic or noradrenergic cells based on the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Figures S4G–S4L). To assess the population activity of the ADRB1+ cells in DP across spontaneous sleep-wake states, we used fiber photometry to record calcium signals from ADRB1+ neurons in freely moving animals (Figure S5A) (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Google Scholar, Gunaydin et al., 2014Gunaydin L.A. Grosenick L. Finkelstein J.C. Kauvar I.V. Fenno L.E. Adhikari A. Lammel S. Mirzabekov J.J. Airan R.D. Zalocusky K.A. et al.Natural neural projection dynamics underlying social behavior.Cell. 2014; 157: 1535-1551Google Scholar). We injected a Cre-dependent AAV encoding the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6s (AAV1/Syn-Flex-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40) into the DP of ADRB1-Cre mice. We implanted both a fiber-optic probe (for subsequent delivery of excitation light and collection of fluorescent emission) and EEG/EMG electrodes (for simultaneous sleep-wake recordings) (Figures S5B and S5C) (Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016Eban-Rothschild A. Rothschild G. Giardino W.J. Jones J.R. de Lecea L. VTA dopaminergic neurons regulate ethologically relevant sleep-wake behaviors.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1356-1366Google Scholar). When aligning the fluorescence signals of calcium activity across different sleep states, robust alterations in the population activity of the ADRB1+ neurons revealed that these cells are active during wakefulness and REM sleep and remain quiescent during NREM sleep (Figures 4D and 4E). Notably, these neurons began to increase their activity before NREM-to-REM and NREM-to-wake transitions and decrease their activity before wake-to-NREM and REM-to-wake transitions (Figure S5D). These findings demonstrate that ADRB1+ neurons in DP change their population activity across sleep-wake states and offer a mechanistic framework for their participation in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. We next applied an optogenetic approach to activate the neurons in the DP. We unilaterally injected a Cre-inducible AAV expressing channel rhodopsin 2 fused with EYFP (AAV5-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP, ChR2 hereafter) or the control virus (AAV5-EF1α-DIO-EYFP, EYFP hereafter) into the DP of ADRB1-Cre mice and implanted the optical fiber and EEG-EMG electrodes (Figures 5A and 5B ). The 10-s trains of light trials were randomly applied during EEG/EMG recording in the light phase. Based on the post hoc analysis of EEG/EMG, the trials were then categorized to be starting from NREM, REM, and wakefulness. Interestingly, light stimulation during NREM sleep elicited immediate NREM-to-wake transitions in the ChR2-infected mice, but not in the EYFP-infected mice (Figures 5C–5E). However, similar stimulation could not trigger REM-to-wake transitions (Figures 5C, 5D, and 5F). Stimulation during the wake phase produced no significant effect on state transitions, although it may play a role in maintaining the wakefulness afterward (Figures 5C, 5D, and 5G). This is consistent with the fact that these neurons are wake and REM active under physiological conditions (Figures 4D and 4E). During wakefulness and REM sleep states, additional activation of these neurons cannot change the states, because the neurons are already active. Nonetheless, the strong effect of NREM-to-wake transition demonstrates that ADRB1+ cells in the DP region are primarily wake promoting. Given that the activity of ADRB1+ neurons of the DP region modulates the wakeful state and that the Adrb1-A187V mutant mice showed altered sleep/wake behavior, we next tested whether the Adrb1-A187V mutation affects the activity of ADRB1+ neurons in the DP. We crossed the transgenic ADRB1-Cre mice with the Adrb1-A187V mice, and a photometry strategy similar to that described above was applied to ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/+ and ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/m mice. The absolute photometry signals depend on the expression level of the virus around the tip of the optical fibers, which makes it difficult to analyze the neural activity between different mice directly. Thus, we compared the relative GCaMP signal amplitude from the active phase (ZT13–16) to the sleep phase (ZT1–4) in the same mouse. The relative amplitude was significantly greater in the Adrb1+/m mice than in the Adrb1+/+ mice (Figures 6A and 6B ). These results suggest that activity of ADRB1+ neurons in the DP is altered by the Adrb1 A187V mutation. Notably, these neurons are wake-active and the Adrb1+/m mice spend 9% more time in wakefulness at ZT13–16. However, mutant mice exhibited 34% increase in the fluorescence signal shown in Figure 6B, suggesting the change of fluorescence here could not be solely attributed to the altered behavior. To further explore whether the changes of GCaMP signals are neuron-autonomous effects and not secondary to circuitry or behavior changes, we performed single cell imaging experiments on acutely isolated DP explants from ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/+ and ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/m mice (Figure 6C). We measured the percentage of ADRB1+ neurons responding with changes in GCaMP signal during treatment with dobutamine (a selective β1 agonist). Neurons were categorized into three groups based on their response to the dobutamine treatment: inhibition, no change, and activation (Figures S6A–S6C). This is consistent with the previous observations that β-ARs in CNS could be either excitatory or inhibitory (Szabadi, 2013Szabadi E. Functional neuroanatomy of the central noradrenergic system.J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2013; 27: 659-693Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 6D, the percentage of DP ADRB1+ neurons that were inhibited by dobutamine was significantly lower (56.7%) in the Adrb1+/m slice. Meanwhile, the percentages of DP ADRB1+ neurons that were activated by dobutamine were comparable between the two groups. These results indicate that the mutation affects ADRB1+ neurons to various extents. However, as a whole, the portion of neurons inhibited is much smaller in mutant than in WT, consistent with an overall increase in ADRB1+ neuron population activity in mutant mice (Figures 6A and 6B). The increased population activity of ADRB1+ neurons from Adrb1 mutant mice could also be caused by enhanced excitability. To test this, we injected the Cre-dependent AAV encoding EGFP (AAV2/EF1a-DIO-EGFP-L10a) into the DP area to label the ADRB1+ cells with GFP. Using current clamp recordings of GFP- labeled ADRB1+ neurons from brain slices from either ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/+ (n = 6, N = 6 out of 23 brain slices from 11 animals) or ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/m mice (n = 6, N = 6 out of 15 brain slices from 15 animals), we obtained action potentials (Figures 7A and 7B ). These action potentials were blocked by 500 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) (data not shown). We found that mutant neurons had a significantly lower rheobase current compared with that of neurons from Adrb1+/+ mice (Figure 7C) without any significant differences in the resting membrane potential (Adrb1 +/+, −60.14 ± 1.28 mV; Adrb1 +/m, −58.11 ± 1.32 mV), voltage threshold (Adrb1 +/+, −43.83 ± 3.00 mV; Adrb1 +/m, −45.50 ± 2.48 mV) or action potential overshoot (Adrb1 +/+, 21 ± 0.85 mV; Adrb1 +/m, 20.17 ± 0.14 mV). Also, a significant increase in firing frequencies was noted in Adrb1+/m neurons compared with those from Adrb1+/+ neurons (Figure 7D). These electrophysiological properties imply that Adrb1+/m neurons are more excitable. We also recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in slices from ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/+ or ADRB1-Cre; Adrb1+/m mice in the presence of the GABAergic antagonist bicuculline (BIC; 50 μM). Because cells in the DP region are heterogeneous (Kohlmeier and Kristiansen, 2010Kohlmeier K.A. Kristiansen U. GABAergic actions on cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental neurons: implications for control of behavioral state.Neuroscience. 2010; 171: 812-829Google Scholar, Wang and Morales, 2009Wang H.L. Morales M. Pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei contain distinct populations of cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the rat.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 340-358Google Scholar), we analyzed sEPSCs that were blocked by post hoc treatment of the glutamatergic antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) and DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (DAP5) (6/15 cells for Adrb1+/+, 40%; 7/22 cells for Adrb1+/m, 32%) (Figures 7E and 7F). Basal sEPSC frequency was slightly higher in Adrb1+/m than Adrb1+/+ neurons (p = 0.057) (Figure 7G). Interestingly, dobutamine treatment increased sEPSC frequency in Adrb1+/m neurons, but not Adrb1+/+ neurons (Figure 7G). Moreover, no significant change in sEPSC amplitude was found for either the genotype or treatment of dobutamine (Figure 7H). We further analyzed the miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in the presence of TTX from Adrb1+/m slices (Figure 7I). We found that the increase of EPSC frequencies were preserved in the presence of TTX, indicating that the increase in spontaneous glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals was independent of action potential generation (Figure 7J). This significant increase of the sEPSC (mEPSC) frequency suggests that presynaptic neurons (of the patched ADRB1+ neuron) are more excitable as a population in response to dobutamine and that glutamatergic transmission is more active in the ADRB1+ neurons in mutant brain slices. We analyzed the Adrb1 homozygous mutant mice (Adrb1 m/m) together with the heterozygous mice to clarify the mechanism. Although the protein level in homozygotes is even less than heterozygotes (Figures S7A and S7B), homozygous mutant mice have a mobile/sleep phenotype similar to heterozygotes (Figures S7C and S7D). In addition, in vivo and in vitro calcium imaging results were also similar between heterozygotes and homozygotes mice (Figures S7E and S7F). Together, these data further demonstrate the causative role of ADRB1 A187V mutation and imply that this mutation exerts dominant effects. Sleep per se is thought to be a conserved behavior from vertebrates to invertebrates, including flies and nematodes (Cirelli et al., 2005bCirelli C. Bushey D. Hill S. Huber R. Kreber R. Ganetzky B.

https://openalex.org/W2972267235,"Visual attention dramatically improves individuals’ ability to see and modulates the responses of neurons in every known visual and oculomotor area, but whether such modulations can account for perceptual improvements is unclear. We measured the relationship between populations of visual neurons, oculomotor neurons and behavior during detection and discrimination tasks. We found that neither of the two prominent hypothesized neuronal mechanisms underlying attention (which concern changes in information coding and the way sensory information is read out) provide a satisfying account of the observed behavioral improvements. Instead, our results are more consistent with the hypothesis that attention reshapes the representation of attended stimuli to more effectively influence behavior. Our results suggest a path toward understanding the neural underpinnings of perception and cognition in health and disease by analyzing neuronal responses in ways that are constrained by behavior and interactions between brain areas. Ruff and Cohen find that the prominent hypotheses about how attention improves perception do not account for behavioral improvements. Instead, their results suggest that attention reshapes sensory representations so the relevant information guides behavior."

It also appears that oceanic blue spaces may be salutogenic, benefitting mental health through their expansive viewscapes, and possibly auditory and olfactory stimuli. Yet, it is unknown whether the same is true for freshwater bodies. In this ecological study, we explored associations between hospitalizations for anxiety/mood disorder in Michigan (>30,000) and proximity to the North American Great Lakes. As a sensitivity analysis, we examined associations for 15 different inland lake sizes. Results showed small, protective effects for distance to Great Lake (β = 0.06, p<0.001) and percentage of inland lakes (β = -0.04, p = 0.004). Unexpectedly, shorter distance to nearest inland lake was associated with higher anxiety/mood disorder hospitalizations. The protective effects of percentage area covered by inland lakes was observed for all lake sizes. These initial findings provide a foundation for future individual-level research with finer measurement of health outcomes and blue space exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2970787300,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are redox-enzymes involved in biomass degradation. All characterized LPMOs possess an active site of two highly conserved histidine residues coordinating a copper ion (the histidine brace), which are essential for LPMO activity. However, some protein sequences that belong to the AA9 LPMO family display a natural N-terminal His to Arg substitution (Arg-AA9). These are found almost entirely in the phylogenetic fungal class Agaricomycetes, associated with wood decay, but no function has been demonstrated for any Arg-AA9. Through bioinformatics, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses we present data, which suggest that Arg-AA9 proteins could have a hitherto unidentified role in fungal degradation of lignocellulosic biomass in conjunction with other secreted fungal enzymes. We present the first structure of an Arg-AA9, LsAA9B, a naturally occurring protein from Lentinus similis. The LsAA9B structure reveals gross changes in the region equivalent to the canonical LPMO copper-binding site, whereas features implicated in carbohydrate binding in AA9 LPMOs have been maintained. We obtained a structure of LsAA9B with xylotetraose bound on the surface of the protein although with a considerably different binding mode compared with other AA9 complex structures. In addition, we have found indications of protein phosphorylation near the N-terminal Arg and the carbohydrate-binding site, for which the potential function is currently unknown. Our results are strong evidence that Arg-AA9s function markedly different from canonical AA9 LPMO, but nonetheless, may play a role in fungal conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are redox-enzymes involved in biomass degradation. All characterized LPMOs possess an active site of two highly conserved histidine residues coordinating a copper ion (the histidine brace), which are essential for LPMO activity. However, some protein sequences that belong to the AA9 LPMO family display a natural N-terminal His to Arg substitution (Arg-AA9). These are found almost entirely in the phylogenetic fungal class Agaricomycetes, associated with wood decay, but no function has been demonstrated for any Arg-AA9. Through bioinformatics, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses we present data, which suggest that Arg-AA9 proteins could have a hitherto unidentified role in fungal degradation of lignocellulosic biomass in conjunction with other secreted fungal enzymes. We present the first structure of an Arg-AA9, LsAA9B, a naturally occurring protein from Lentinus similis. The LsAA9B structure reveals gross changes in the region equivalent to the canonical LPMO copper-binding site, whereas features implicated in carbohydrate binding in AA9 LPMOs have been maintained.

https://openalex.org/W2970542947,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequently observed among extracranial pediatric solid tumors. It displays an extreme clinical heterogeneity, in particular for the presentation at diagnosis and response to treatment, often depending on cancer cell differentiation/stemness. The frequent presence of elevated hematic and urinary levels of catecholamines in patients affected by NB suggests that the dissection of adrenergic system is crucial for a better understanding of this cancer. β3-adrenoreceptor (β3-AR) is the last identified member of adrenergic receptors, involved in different tumor conditions, such as melanoma. Multiple studies have shown that the dysregulation of the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism and signaling is involved in many pathological diseases including cancer. However, whether S1P is crucial for NB progression and aggressiveness is still under investigation. Here we provide experimental evidence that β3-AR is expressed in NB, both human specimens and cell lines, where it is critically involved in the activation of proliferation and the regulation between stemness/differentiation, via its functional cross-talk with sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2)/S1P receptor 2 (S1P2) axis. The specific antagonism of β3-AR by SR59230A inhibits NB growth and tumor progression, by switching from stemness to cell differentiation both in vivo and in vitro through the specific blockade of SK2/S1P2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2970152576,"Shear-wave electrography (SWE) is a method used to assess tissue elasticity. Recently, it has been used to assess muscle stiffness, but the reliability of SWE for this purpose has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of SWE on porcine meat specimens and the human biceps femoris muscle. Measurements on meat specimens (n = 20) were performed by three raters and with a custom-built device that allowed constant application force. Measurements on human participants (n = 20) were performed by two raters in relaxed and stretched muscle positions on two visits. Most aspects of repeatability and reproducibility were good or high, with intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values above 0.70. Minimal detectable changes were lower in a relaxed (6-10%) than stretched (15-16%) muscle position. In conclusion, SWE is a reliable tool for assessing muscle stiffness if the muscle is examined in relaxed condition, while changing the force applied with the probe for as little as 1.5 N results in significantly lower repeatability."
https://openalex.org/W2970921484,"Genetic profiling studies on muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs) have discovered molecular subtypes with different biological characteristics. Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers such as GATA3, cytokeratin (CK) 20, CK5/6, and p53 are associated with these subtypes. In this study, we investigated the biological and prognostic significance of these IHC markers in MIBCs from 91 patients who underwent radical cystectomy. High Ki-67 indices were associated with negative CK20 (p = 0.002) and diffuse CK5/6 (p = 0.001) staining. By contrast, tumors with diffuse GATA3 expression had low Ki-67 index (p = 0.006). Regarding p53, three staining patterns were associated with a high Ki-67 index: (1) complete absence, (2) diffusely strong nuclear reactivity, and (3) diffusely strong cytoplasmic staining (p < 0.001 compared with other patterns). CK5/6 and CK20 expression was typically present in a reciprocal fashion; however, diffuse GATA3 and CK5/6 coexpression was observed in 13 (14.29%) cases. Among 78 chemotherapy-naïve patients, low GATA3 staining was associated with worse recurrence-free survival in both univariate (p = 0.008) and multivariate analyses (p = 0.002). CK20, CK5/6, or p53 expression was not associated with clinical outcome. Based on our results, IHC staining for GATA3 may help risk stratification in patients with MIBC receiving radical cystectomy. In addition, the differences in Ki-67 indices suggested that aberrant p53 expression was better defined by the three aforementioned patterns, rather than percentage of nuclear staining alone."

https://openalex.org/W2970191729,"Investigations at the Maya site of Ceibal, Guatemala, documented an artificial plateau, measuring 600 x 340 m in horizontal dimensions and 6 to 15 m in height. Unlike highly visible pyramids, such horizontally extensive constructions covered by the rainforest are difficult to recognize on the ground, but airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) revealed its planned form. Excavations carried out over many years provided data on its construction sequence, fill volumes, and labor investments. The initial construction of the plateau occurred around 950 B.C. when a formal ceremonial complex was built in its center. This was the period when the inhabitants of the Maya lowlands were adopting a new way of life with greater reliance on maize agriculture, full sedentism, and ceramic use. The inhabitants of areas surrounding Ceibal, who retained certain levels of residential mobility, probably participated in the construction of the plateau. In this regard, the Ceibal plateau is comparable to monumental constructions that emerged before or during the transition to agriculture or sedentism in other parts of the world. The data from Ceibal compel researchers to examine the social implications of monumental constructions in the Maya lowlands before the establishment of centralized polities with hereditary rulers. Unlike pyramids, where access to the summits may have been limited to privileged individuals, the horizontal monumentality of the plateau was probably more conducive to inclusive interaction. The Ceibal plateau continued to be built up during the Preclassic period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 175), and its fill volume substantially surpassed those of pyramids. Large-scale construction projects likely promoted organizational and managerial innovations among participants, which may have set the stage for later administrative centralization."
https://openalex.org/W2971149479,"Localized, nonindolent prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by large-scale genomic rearrangements, aneuploidy, chromothripsis, and other forms of chromosomal instability (CIN), yet how this occurs remains unclear. A well-established mechanism of CIN is the overproduction of centrosomes, which promotes tumorigenesis in various mouse models. Therefore, we developed a single-cell assay for quantifying centrosomes in human prostate tissue. Surprisingly, centrosome loss—which has not been described in human cancer—was associated with PCa progression. By chemically or genetically inducing centrosome loss in nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells, mitotic errors ensued, producing aneuploid, and multinucleated cells. Strikingly, transient or chronic centrosome loss transformed prostate epithelial cells, which produced highly proliferative and poorly differentiated malignant tumors in mice. Our findings suggest that centrosome loss could create a cellular crisis with oncogenic potential in prostate epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2970589837,"Virulent strains of the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae cause the diarrheal disease cholera by releasing cholera toxin into the small intestine. V. cholerae acquired its cholera toxin genes by lysogenic infection with the filamentous bacteriophage CTXϕ. CTXϕ uses its minor coat protein pIII, located in multiple copies at the phage tip, to bind to the V. cholerae toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). However, the molecular details of this interaction and the mechanism of phage internalization are not well-understood. The TCP filament is a polymer of major pilins, TcpA, and one or more minor pilin, TcpB. TCP are retractile, with both retraction and assembly initiated by TcpB. Consistent with these roles in pilus dynamics, we hypothesized that TcpB controls both binding and internalization of CTXϕ. To test this hypothesis, we determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal half of TcpB and characterized its interactions with CTXϕ pIII. We show that TcpB is a homotrimer in its crystallographic form as well as in solution and is present in multiple copies at the pilus tip, which likely facilitates polyvalent binding to pIII proteins at the phage tip. We further show that recombinant forms of TcpB and pIII interact in vitro, and both TcpB and anti-TcpB antibodies block CTXϕ infection of V. cholerae. Finally, we show that CTXϕ uptake requires TcpB-mediated retraction. Our data support a model whereby CTXϕ and TCP bind in a tip-to-tip orientation, allowing the phage to be drawn into the V. cholerae periplasm as an extension of the pilus filament.

https://openalex.org/W2970672244,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Currently, the prognosis of the patients with GBM is very poor and new molecular targets and treatment strategies are urgently needed to combat it. MicroRNA-148a (miR-148a) has been shown to be dysregulated in certain tumor types. However, the role of miR-148a in the pathogenesis of GBM is not fully understood. Here we comprehensively analyzed the roles of miR-148a, downstream DLGAP1, and their molecular pathways in GBM. We showed that miR-148a promote the proliferation and growth of GBM cells both in vitro and in vivo, and also induced the migration, invasion, and EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) program of GBM cells by directly targeting DLGAP1. Furthermore, we identified 31 new miR-148a targets and found that miR-148a function was mainly involved in the cell adhesion signaling pathway and was associated with nervous system diseases. Our findings provide a new mechanism for miR-148a-mediated GBM cell invasion and reveal previously unreported targets of miR-148a as well as novel miR-148a-mediated regulatory networks in GBM. These results increase the understanding of the role of miR-148a in GBM and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for GBM."

https://openalex.org/W2970011539,"The mycobacterial cell envelope is crucial to host-pathogen interactions as a barrier against antibiotics and the host immune response. In addition, cell envelope lipids are mycobacterial virulence factors. Cell envelope lipid biosynthesis is the target of a number of frontline tuberculosis treatments and has been the focus of much research. However, the transport mechanisms by which these lipids reach the mycomembrane remain poorly understood. Many envelope lipids are exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space via the mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) family of proteins. In other bacteria, lipoproteins can contribute to outer membrane biogenesis through direct binding of substrates and/or protein-protein associations with extracytoplasmic biosynthetic enzymes. In this report, we investigate whether the lipoprotein LpqN plays a similar role in mycobacteria. Using a genetic two-hybrid approach, we demonstrate that LpqN interacts with periplasmic loop domains of the MmpL3 and MmpL11 transporters that export mycolic acid-containing cell envelope lipids. We observe that LpqN also interacts with secreted cell envelope biosynthetic enzymes such as Ag85A via pulldown assays. The X-ray crystal structures of LpqN and LpqN bound to dodecyl-trehalose suggest that LpqN directly binds trehalose monomycolate, the MmpL3 and Ag85A substrate. Finally, we observe altered lipid profiles of the ΔlpqN mutant during biofilm maturation, pointing toward a possible physiological role for the protein. The results of this study suggest that LpqN may act as a membrane fusion protein, connecting MmpL transporters with periplasmic proteins, and provide general insight into the role of lipoproteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell envelope biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2970801228,"Akt signaling is an important regulator of neural development, but the distinctive function of Akt isoforms in brain development presents a challenge. Here we show Siah1 as an ubiquitin ligase that preferentially interacts with Akt3 and facilitates ubiquitination and degradation of Akt3. Akt3 is enriched in the axonal shaft and branches but not growth cone tips, where Siah1 is prominently present. Depletion of Siah1 enhanced Akt3 levels in the soma and axonal tips, eliciting multiple branching. Brain-specific somatic mutation in Akt3-E17K escapes from Siah1-mediated degradation and causes improper neural development with dysmorphic neurons. Remarkably, coexpression of Siah1 with Akt3-WT restricted disorganization of neural development is caused by Akt3 overexpression, whereas forced expression of Siah1 with the Akt3-E17K mutant fails to cope with malformation of neural development. These findings demonstrate that Siah1 limits Akt3 turnover during brain development and that this event is essential for normal organization of the neural network.

https://openalex.org/W2970858924,"Purpose To determine the effects of antenatal betamethasone and/or postnatal dexamethasone administration on hyperoxic lung and brain injuries in newborn rats. Methods Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five experimental groups: normoxia-vehicle-vehicle group, hyperoxia-vehicle-vehicle group, hyperoxia-betamethasone-vehicle group, hyperoxia-vehicle-dexamethasone group, and hyperoxia-betamethasone-dexamethasone group according to (i) whether rats were exposed to normoxia or hyperoxia after birth to postnatal day (P) 14, (ii) whether antenatal betamethasone (0.2mg/kg) or vehicle was administered to pregnant rats at gestation days 19 and 20, and (iii) whether three tapering doses of dexamethasone (0.5, 0.3, 0.1mg/kg per day) or vehicle were administered on P5, 6 and 7, respectively. The lungs and brains were harvested for histological and biochemical analyses at P8 and P14. Results Postnatal dexamethasone but not antenatal betamethasone significantly enhanced hyperoxia-induced reduction in body weight gain and alveolarization and increased lung terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells both at P8 and P14, transiently increased hyperoxia-induced reductions in brain weight gain and angiogenesis, and increase in brain TUNEL-positive cells at P8 but not at P14. Co-administration of antenatal betamethasone significantly enhanced dexamethasone-induced impairments in alveolarization both at P8 and P14, transient increases in lung and brain oxidative stresses, and increases in brain TUNEL-positive cells at P8 but not at P14. Conclusion Although postnatal dexamethasone but not antenatal betamethasone alone significantly increased hyperoxic lung and brain injuries, co-administration of antenatal betamethasone significantly enhanced the detrimental effects of postnatal dexamethasone on hyperoxic lung and brain injuries in newborn rats."

This study aimed to compare hemodynamic effects and resuscitation outcomes between a motor-driven, automatic simultaneous sterno-thoracic cardiopulmonary resuscitation device and the Lund University cardiac arrest system (LUCAS).After 2 minutes of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation (VF), Yorkshire pigs (weight 35-60 kg) received CPR with an automatic simultaneous sterno-thoracic CPR device (X-CPR group, n = 13) or the Lund University cardiac arrest system (LUCAS group, n = 12). Basic life support for 6 minutes and advanced cardiovascular life support for 12 minutes, including defibrillation and epinephrine administration, were provided. Hemodynamic parameters and resuscitation outcomes, including return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 24-hour survival, and cerebral performance category (CPC) at 24 hours, were evaluated.Hemodynamic parameters, including aortic pressures, coronary perfusion pressure, carotid blood flow, and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure were not significantly different between the two groups. Resuscitation outcomes were also not significantly different between the groups (X-CPR vs. LUCAS; rate of ROSC: 31% vs 25%, p = 1.000; 24-hour survival rate: 31% vs 17%, p = 0.645; neurological outcome with CPC ≤2: 31% vs 17%, p = 0.645). Also no significant difference in incidence complications associated with resuscitation was found between the groups.CPR with a motor-driven X-CPR and CPR with the LUCAS produced similar hemodynamic effects and resuscitation outcomes in a swine model of cardiac arrest."
