https://openalex.org/W2047269087,The introduction of biodegradable implant materials as well as minimally invasive surgical procedures in medicine has substantially improved health care within the past few decades. This report describes a group of degradable thermoplastic polymers that are able to change their shape after an increase in temperature. Their shape-memory capability enables bulky implants to be placed in the body through small incisions or to perform complex mechanical deformations automatically. A smart degradable suture was created to illustrate the potential of these shape-memory thermoplastics in biomedical applications.
https://openalex.org/W2104511903,"Evolution can be predicted in the short term from a knowledge of selection and inheritance. However, in the long term evolution is unpredictable because environments, which determine the directions and magnitudes of selection coefficients, fluctuate unpredictably. These two features of evolution, the predictable and unpredictable, are demonstrated in a study of two populations of Darwin's finches on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major. From 1972 to 2001, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and Geospiza scandens (cactus finch) changed several times in body size and two beak traits. Natural selection occurred frequently in both species and varied from unidirectional to oscillating, episodic to gradual. Hybridization occurred repeatedly though rarely, resulting in elevated phenotypic variances in G. scandens and a change in beak shape. The phenotypic states of both species at the end of the 30-year study could not have been predicted at the beginning. Continuous, long-term studies are needed to detect and interpret rare but important events and nonuniform evolutionary change."
https://openalex.org/W2172298636,"Lymphatic metastasis contributes to mortality from solid tumors. Whether metastasizing cancer cells reach lymph nodes via intratumor lymphatic vessels is unknown. Here, we examine functional lymphatics associated with mouse tumors expressing normal or elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor–C (VEGF-C), a molecule that stimulates lymphangiogenesis. Although VEGF-C overexpression increased lymphatic surface area in the tumor margin and lymphatic metastasis, these tumors contained no functional lymphatics, as assessed by four independent functional assays and immunohistochemical staining. These findings suggest that the functional lymphatics in the tumor margin alone are sufficient for lymphatic metastasis and should be targeted therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2157001218,"Colloids display intriguing transitions between gas, liquid, solid and liquid crystalline phases. Such phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature and have been studied for decades. However, the predictions of phase diagrams are not always realized; systems often become undercooled, supersaturated, or trapped in gel-like states. In many cases the end products strongly depend on the starting position in the phase diagram and discrepancies between predictions and actual observations are due to the intricacies of the dynamics of phase transitions. Colloid science aims to understand the underlying mechanisms of these transitions. Important advances have been made, for example, with new imaging techniques that allow direct observation of individual colloidal particles undergoing phase transitions, revealing some of the secrets of the complex pathways involved."

https://openalex.org/W2029158589,"High-throughput screens have begun to reveal the protein interaction network that underpins most cellular functions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . How the organization of this network affects the evolution of the proteins that compose it is a fundamental question in molecular evolution. We show that the connectivity of well-conserved proteins in the network is negatively correlated with their rate of evolution. Proteins with more interactors evolve more slowly not because they are more important to the organism, but because a greater proportion of the protein is directly involved in its function. At sites important for interaction between proteins, evolutionary changes may occur largely by coevolution, in which substitutions in one protein result in selection pressure for reciprocal changes in interacting partners. We confirm one predicted outcome of this process—namely, that interacting proteins evolve at similar rates."
https://openalex.org/W2108170463,"Genetic and environmental factors, including diet and life-style, both contribute to cardiovascular disease, cancers, and other major causes of mortality, but various lines of evidence indicate that environmental factors are most important. Overly enthusiastic expectations regarding the benefits of genetic research for disease prevention have the potential to distort research priorities and spending for health. However, integration of new genetic information into epidemiologic studies can help clarify causal relations between both life-style and genetic factors and risks of disease. Thus, a balanced approach should provide the best data to make informed choices about the most effective means to prevent disease."

https://openalex.org/W1660648079,"Gammadelta T cell receptor-bearing dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) found in murine skin recognize antigen expressed by damaged or stressed keratinocytes. Activated DETCs produce keratinocyte growth factors (KGFs) and chemokines, raising the possibility that DETCs play a role in tissue repair. We performed wound healing studies and found defects in keratinocyte proliferation and tissue reepithelialization in the absence of wild-type DETCs. In vitro skin organ culture studies demonstrated that adding DETCs or recombinant KGF restored normal wound healing in gammadelta DETC-deficient skin. We propose that DETCs recognize antigen expressed by injured keratinocytes and produce factors that directly affect wound repair."
https://openalex.org/W2053914556,"Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases form a large, evolutionarily old family of NAD(P)(H)-dependent enzymes with over 60 genes found in the human genome. Despite low levels of sequence identity (often 10–30%), the three-dimensional structures display a highly similar α/β folding pattern. We have analyzed the role of several conserved residues regarding folding, stability, steady-state kinetics, and coenzyme binding using bacterial 3β/17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and selected mutants. Structure determination of the wild-type enzyme at 1.2-Å resolution by x-ray crystallography and docking analysis was used to interpret the biochemical data. Enzyme kinetic data from mutagenetic replacements emphasize the critical role of residues Thr-12, Asp-60, Asn-86, Asn-87, and Ala-88 in coenzyme binding and catalysis. The data also demonstrate essential interactions of Asn-111 with active site residues. A general role of its side chain interactions for maintenance of the active site configuration to build up a proton relay system is proposed.

Persson M. Jeffery J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), corresponding to the protein families of “short-chain” dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR)1 and “medium-chain” dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR), respectively, SDR enzymes have received much attention. They constitute a large protein family with well over 2000 annotated enzyme and species variant sequences in databases and are represented in all life forms with minimally 60 genes found in the human genome (2Jörnvall H.

The SDR enzymes span several EC classes, from oxidoreductases and lyases to isomerases, with NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases constituting the majority of forms. In this class, many enzymes with different specificities act on steroids, prostaglandins, aliphatic alcohols, and xenobiotics. The pairwise sequence identity between different enzymes is low, typically 10–30%, but all available three-dimensional structures (∼20) display a highly similar α/β folding pattern (5Ghosh D.

Most SDR enzymes have a 250–350-residue core structure, frequently with additional N- or C-terminal transmembrane domains or signal peptides. Conserved sequence regions cover a variable N-terminal Gly-X 3-Gly-X-Gly motif as part of the nucleotide binding region and the active site with a triad of catalytically important Ser, Tyr, and Lys residues, of which Tyr is the most conserved residue within the whole family (2Jörnvall H.

The functions of the residues at these particular sites have been elucidated by a combination of chemical modifications, sequence comparisons, structure analyses, and site-directed replacements (2Jörnvall H.

Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, several other conserved but still variable residues have not been analyzed in detail. To understand their role, we now carried through a mutagenesis study using bacterial 3β/17β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β/17β-HSD) analyzing effects on enzymatic function and the stability of replacements, assisted by x-ray crystallography and docking analysis. Other residues have been studied before (13Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Berndt K.D. Persson B. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but novel segments investigated include Asp-60 (between βC and αD), an NNAG motif (Asn-86–Gly-89 in βD), and Asn-111 in αE (Fig. 1). Molecular cloning of 3β/17β-HSD (EC 1.1.1.51) and purification of recombinant proteins from Comamonas testosteroni ATCC 11996 (DSM, Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, Germany) was carried out as described (13Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Berndt K.D. Persson B. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using metal-chelate chromatography of His-tagged enzymes. Mutagenetic replacements were performed using the megaprime method (14Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Wild-type sequences used for amplification were: 5′-GGCAGCCATATGACAAATCGTTTGCAGG (sense) and 5′-CTAGGGATCCCTATAGCCCCATGCCCAGAAT (antisense). Mutagenesis primers covering the desired replacement region were as follows (5′→3′): CCTCGCTGCTCACGGCATGGCGGAC (D60A), GCCGGCATTGGCGACCAGCACATTG (N86A), CAGCAGGATGCCGGAATTGTTGACCAG (A88S), GAAGACTGACTCGGTGAGGATCTTGAGCAGG (N111L), GCTGGCGCTAAAGCCGGCGTATTG (Y151F). The other mutants used were prepared as described (13Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Berndt K.D. Persson B. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequence analysis using Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Biosciences) or BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems). Purity of protein samples was assessed by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis of pure samples after hydrolysis in 6 m HCl followed by ninhydrin-based quantification on an LKB Alpha plus analyzer. Enzyme activities were measured as NAD(H)-dependent 3β- and 17β-oxidoreductase activities by determination of the change of absorbance at 340 nm and using a molar extinction coefficient for NADH of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Recordings were carried out with a Cary 300Bio instrument. Reactions were performed in 1.0-ml volumes at 298 K. Conditions for dehydrogenase activities were: 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) and 250 μm NAD+, varying the amount of iso-ursodeoxycholic acid (3β,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid, isoUDCA) or dehydroepiandrosterone (5-androsten-3β-ol, 17-one, DHEA; 3β-HSD activity) and testosterone (4-androsten-17βol-3-one; 17β-HSD activity). Conditions for reductase activities were: 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.0) and 250 μm NADH, varying the amount of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-androstane, 17β-ol-3-one; 3-ketoreductase activity) and androsterone (5α-androstane-3α-ol-17-one; 17-ketoreductase activity). Kinetic constants were calculated with the EnzPack software (Biosoft). Binding of NADH was determined by monitoring fluorescence energy transfer as a function of nucleotide concentration in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, at 298 K using a Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorimeter. Binding of NAD+ was assessed in a similar manner by displacement of bound NADH in 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.5. Dissociation constants were obtained by non-linear regression using a 1:1 binding model as described previously (12Filling C. Nordling E. Benach J. Berndt K.D. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Oppermann U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The structure of the wild-type 3β/17β-HSD apoform was determined by x-ray crystallography to a final resolution of 1.2 Å (Protein Data Bank accession number 1hxh). Crystallization, x-ray analysis, model building, and refinement have been described in detail elsewhere (15Benach J. Knapp S. Oppermann U.C. Hagglund O. Jörnvall H. Ladenstein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 2J. Benach, C. Filling, U. Oppermann, P. Roversi, G. Bricogve, K. D. Berndt, H. Jörnvall, and R. Ladenstein, submitted for publication. The mean coordinate error for the 1.2-Å structure is 0.06, calculated by block-matrix inversion in SHELXL (16Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). The structures of known SDR members were retrieved by a FASTA search versus PDB. The structures were superimposed, and a structural alignment was created using ICM (Molsoft LLC, San Diego, CA) and edited in BioEdit. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed using a Beckman XL-1 ultracentrifuge. For sedimentation equilibrium and velocity studies, both absorbance at 280 nm and interference were recorded at different rotor speeds and protein concentrations at 20 °C. Sodium phosphate buffer (30 mm, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) was used. Data evaluation was performed using the Origin 4.0 software package. Partial specific volumes of wild-type and mutant proteins and buffer densities were calculated using the program Sednterp. Double sector cells were used for sedimentation velocity studies. Interference scans were recorded in intervals of 2 min. Assessment of wild-type and mutant conformations was achieved by circular dichroism spectroscopy by recording the ellipticity as a function of wavelength between 260 and 195 nm using an AVIV Model62 DS spectropolarimeter. Conformational stability was determined by titration of the individual proteins with guanidine-HCl using a titration robot and by monitoring CD at 222 nm as described earlier (12Filling C. Nordling E. Benach J. Berndt K.D. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Oppermann U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Berndt K.D. Persson B. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant 3β/17β-HSD forms were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by metal-chelate chromatography (Fig. 2). Proteins were analyzed regarding folding, stability, coenzyme binding, and steady-state kinetics. Judged from CD spectroscopy, wild-type and mutant forms displayed essentially identical spectral characteristics, indicating similar secondary structure properties. Stability measurements were performed by titration with guanidinium hydrochloride, monitored by CD spectroscopy and by determination of the transition temperatures using differential scanning calorimetry. Judging from these experiments, no significant differences between wild-type and mutant proteins could be detected, indicating similar fold and conformational stability (data not shown). Steady-state kinetics were determined with different substrates for oxo-reductase and β-dehydrogenase reactions at C3 and C17 of the steroid. The kinetic and coenzyme binding data obtained are summarized in TablesI and II. Bacterial 3β/17β-HSD is able to catalyze specific dehydrogenations/reductions at positions 3 and 17 of steroids with different conformations, i.e. being trans- orcis-configured between ring A and B.

Number of experiments, n = 3–5. Detection limits for relativek cat/K m values are 0.0003% for dehydrogenase activities and 0.003% for reductase activities. Number of experiments were from three to five. The mutants compared for dehydrogenase and reductase activities have residue exchanges at positions Thr-12, Asp-60, Asn-86, Asn-87, Ala-88, Asn-111, Ser-138, and Tyr-151, surrounding the coenzyme binding region or located at the active site. Depending on the amino acid substitution, differential effects on enzymatic constants were observed. Completely inactive enzymes were obtained with the N111L, S138A, and Y151F mutants, whereas partially active enzymes with significant changes were observed for the other substitutions (Table I). Replacement of Thr-12 by Ala results in an enzyme that is only able to catalyze the reductive reaction at position C3 and the corresponding dehydrogenase activity with DHEA as substrate. All other activities are not detectable. Exchange to Ser results in an enzyme with enzymatic properties largely similar to those of the wild-type form (Table I). A profound change in cofactor binding (Table II) is observed with the T12A mutant; the K D for NADH is altered from 1.0 to 41 μm, whereas theK D for NAD+ changes from 1.5 μm for the wild type to 0.1 μm for T12A. This altered binding is reflected in a lowered K m value for NAD+ (8.96 versus 29.6 μm for wild type) and an increased K m value for NADH (36.7 versus 21.6 μm for wild type). Mutants D60A, N86A, N87A, and A88S display reduced catalytic efficiencies over the wild type with the exception of the A88S mutant, which shows a 20% higher relativek cat/K m value for 3-oxoreductase activity. The drop ink cat/K m values is more pronounced for dehydrogenase activities (ranging from 2.3 to 50%versus wild type) than for reductase values (ranging from 25 to 120% versus wild type). The relative change in the ratio of dehydrogenase/reductase reaction for the different comparable substrate pairs (i.e. similar ring configurations and substituents) at positions C3 (DHEA/5α-dihydrotestosterone) and C17 (testosterone/androsterone) ranges from about 3-fold (N87A, position C3) to over 25-fold for the A88S form. Here the relativek cat/K m for reactions at C17 is shifted from 72% for the reductase reaction to 2.6% for dehydrogenase activity as compared with the corresponding wild-type values. Significant changes ink cat/K m values are also observed with the 5β-reduced steroid isoUDCA as substrate for 3β-HSD activity, supporting the conclusion that Asn-86, Asn-87, and Ala-88 mutants significantly attenuate oxidative kinetic constants and show a less pronounced effect in the reductive reactions catalyzed. NAD+ binding constants for the N86A and N87A mutants are in the same range as the wild-type value (1.5 and 1.1 μm, respectively, versus 1.5 μm). Slightly lowered values are observed for the D60A and A88S forms (0.3 μm). Depending on the substrate for determination of 3β-HSD activity (isoUDCA or DHEA), significant increases (up to 1550 μm, A88S, isoUDCA substrate) in K m for NAD+are observed except for N87A (81.2 versus 83.2, isoUDCA substrate). Weaker NADH binding is observed for Asp-60, Asn-86, Asn-87, and Ala-88 mutants, ranging from 3.1 to 19 μm, which is accompanied by a moderate increase in K m for NADH (range from 25.5 to 52.3 μm) except for the N86A mutant displaying a K m of 7.5. Taken together, the drastic reduction ink cat/K m values for the oxidative reaction of the Asp-60, Asn-86, Asn-87, and Ala-88 forms is mainly due to increased K m for NAD+without significant decrease in binding affinities, indicating inhibition of substrate formation without affecting association of the enzyme-substrate complex. Thek cat/K m values for the reductive reactions are slightly lowered, accompanied by a decrease in NADH binding. Steroid structure is a further contributing factor to the differential decrease in oxidation since differences between isoUDCA and DHEA are observed. Mutations performed within or close to the active site were residues Ser-138 and Tyr-151, recognized previously to be part of a catalytic triad with Lys-155, and the conserved Asn-111, located within helix αE, which forms the main subunit interaction surface. Mutants N111L, S138A, and Y151F are enzymatically inactive. Coenzyme binding constants of these mutants are changed but within the range observed with the mutants described above (from 0.2 μm for NAD+ for Y151F to 12 μmfor NADH for S138A). As described earlier (13Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Berndt K.D. Persson B. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), substitution of Ser for Thr at position 138 yields an active enzyme. Loss of activity observed for S138A and Y151F mutants thus underscores the critical role of these residues in catalysis. The apo structure of wild-type 3β/17β-HSD was determined by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.2 Å.2 The enzyme forms a tetramer with subunit interactions similar to those of tetrameric SDR structures (9Tanaka N.

The geometry of coenzyme binding and active sites was sufficiently similar to allow docking analysis of a 3β/17β-HSD ternary complex with NAD+ and a steroid substrate (3β-OH-5-androsten-17-one) (Figs. 3 and4).Figure 4Close-up view of active-site residues in 3β/17β-HSD determined by x-ray crystallography in relation to modeled NAD+ (red) and steroid substrate (3β-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one,blue) molecules. Tyr-151 is in catalytic distance to the substrate hydroxyl (2.7 Å), further stabilized by Ser-138 interaction to the substrate hydroxyl (2.6 Å). A network of residues and interactions comprising Lys-155, Ser-154, Asn-111, and Ile-90 via a conserved water molecule is shown. For clarity, NAD+ contacts are omitted (cf. “Results and Discussion”).

No direct interactions of Thr-12, Asn-86, and Asn-87 with the coenzyme are observed in our model and in most other coenzyme complexes (9Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7219-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An exception is the recently determined porcine carbonyl reductase, where backbone carbonyl interactions of Asn-89 to the 3′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose are found (20Ghosh D. Sawicki M. Pletnev V. Erman M. Ohno S. Nakajin S. Duax W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18457-18463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on structural and kinetic data, we conclude that these residues (Thr-12, Asn-86, Asn-87) supply a framework essential for keeping the strands oriented within the central β-sheet, important for coenzyme positioning (Fig. 3). Multiple and critical side chain and backbone interactions are formed through Thr-12 to strand βD (ND2Asn-87-OThr-12: 3.05 Å; OG1Thr-12-NAsn-87: 3.03 Å; OG1Thr-12-NAla-88: 2.98Å) and between strands βD and βE through Asn-86 and Asn-87 (OAsn-86-NMet-136: 2.93Å; NAsn-86-OIle-134: 2.83Å; OD1Asn-135-ND2Asn-86: 2.87Å). The coenzyme is bound through few specific contacts, performed through other residues than Thr-12, Asn-86, and with indicated exceptions, Asn-87. Among the residues investigated, Asp-60 and Ala-88 contribute directly to coenzyme binding, a view supported by the significantly altered coenzyme constants. In the modeled structure, the carboxyl side chain of Asp-60 is in weak H-bonding distance to the adenine ring (OD1 Asp-60-N6A 3.99 Å) (Fig. 2), and similar interactions between Asp-60 and coenzyme are observed in, for example, MLCR, 7α-HSD, or CR (9Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure. 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18457-18463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Side chain to backbone interactions are also observed (OD2Asp-60-OGSer-62: 2.7 Å), and the main role of Asp-60 appears to be in the stabilization of the turn between βC and αD as part of the adenine ring binding pocket (10Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Ala-88 can make hydrophobic contacts to the adenine ring and thus contributes to binding of the coenzyme. These hydrophobic interactions of Ala-88 appear to be an important characteristic since mutation to Ser significantly changes activities. The previously determined triad of Ser-Tyr-Lys residues (positions 138, 151, and 155, respectively in 3β/17β-HSD) constitutes the active site (2Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Our data extend this concept by addition of an essential Asn-111 to this triad to form an active site tetrad. Previous studies support the concept that Tyr-151 functions as the catalytic base (2Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), whereas Ser-138 stabilizes the substrate, and Lys-155 forms hydrogen bonds with the nicotinamide ribose moiety and lowers the pK a of the Tyr-OH to promote proton transfer (Fig.5). In the 3β/17β-HSD apo structure, water molecules are bound to the Tyr-OH and Lys side chain, thus mimicking substrate and ribose hydroxyl group positions.

https://openalex.org/W2059923548,"More than 50 years ago, Harald Sverdrup developed a simple model for the necessary conditions leading to the spring bloom of phytoplankton. Although this model has been used extensively across a variety of aquatic ecosystems, its application requires knowledge of community compensation irradiance (IC), the light level where photosynthetic and ecosystem community loss processes balance. However, reported IC values have varied by an order of magnitude. Here, IC estimates are determined using satellite and hydrographic data sets consistent with the assumptions in Sverdrup's 1953 critical depth hypothesis. Retrieved values of IC are approximately uniform throughout much of the North Atlantic with a mean value of 1.3 mol photons meter-2 day-1. These community-based IC determinations are roughly twice typical values found for phytoplankton alone indicating that phytoplankton account for approximately one-half of community ecosystem losses. This work also suggests that important aspects of heterotrophic community dynamics can be assessed using satellite observations."

We use the global cooling and drying of the atmosphere that was observed after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo to test model predictions of the climate feedback from water vapor. Here, we first highlight the success of the model in reproducing the observed drying after the volcanic eruption. Then, by comparing model simulations with and without water vapor feedback, we demonstrate the importance of the atmospheric drying in amplifying the temperature change and show that, without the strong positive feedback from water vapor, the model is unable to reproduce the observed cooling. These results provide quantitative evidence of the reliability of water vapor feedback in current climate models, which is crucial to their use for global warming projections."

The magnitude of the system feedbacks or variability appears as large or larger than that of the solar forcing, making the Sun's true role ambiguous.

The signature of such a process would be the decay of pions (pi(0)), which are generated when the protons collide with atoms and molecules in an interstellar cloud: pion decay results in gamma-rays with a particular spectral-energy distribution.

Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar), but the signaling events remain unknown. TRAIL-induced signal transduction has been well characterized in transfectants, but it remains largely elusive in nontransfected tumor cells. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 have been shown to initiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which appears to be modulated by c-FLIP and PED/PEA-15. However, signal events of these proteins in TRAIL-induced apoptosis have not yet been established. Therefore, we examined the TRAIL-induced DISC to explore the molecular mechanisms in malignant glioma cells. Our studies showed for the first time that caspase-8 and caspase-10 are recruited to the DISC in both TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant glioma cells but that caspase activation is inhibited by c-FLIP and PED/PEA-15 in the DISC in TRAIL-resistant cells. In these cells, phosphorylation of PED/PEA-15 influences its recruitment and implementation of its antiapoptotic function. The human parental Jurkat cells and FADD-deficient (FADDdef) and caspase-8-deficient (caspase-8def) clones (gifts from J. Blenis; Boston, MA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The human malignant glioma cell lines LN-18, LN-215, LN-464, and LN-443 (gifts from N. De Tribolet; Lausanne, Switzerland) and U343MG and T98G (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Recombinant human soluble FLAG-tagged TRAIL (TRAIL-FLAG) was from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-human-FADD (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-human caspase-8 and caspase-10 (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), and anti-human c-FLIP NF6 (28Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Rabbit antibodies included anti-human caspase-3 and ERK1/2 (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), anti-DR5 (ProSci. Inc., Poway, CA), and anti-PED serum as described previously (30Condorelli G. Vigliotta G. Iavarone C. Caruso M. Tocchetti C.G. Andreozzi F. Cafieri A. Tecce M.F. Formisano P. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3858-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse κ, IgG2b, and IgG1 antibodies were from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL); HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Caspase-10 inhibitor z-AEVD-fmk and caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Goat anti-mouse IgG1-agarose, KN-93, protease inhibitor cocktail, Triton X-100, and all other chemicals of analytical grade were from Sigma. For cell death, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well and treated at 37 °C for 16 h with TRAIL-FLAG (starting at 1 μg/ml) in 3-fold serial dilutions in the presence of 3 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2. Some cells were also treated with KN-93 (starting at 100 μm), z-IETD-fmk (20 μm), or Z-AEVD-fmk (20 μm). For glioma cells, cell death was determined by crystal violet assay (18Hao C. Beguinot F.

For Jurkat cells, dead cells were stained with trypan blue and counted by cytometry. For cleavage of caspases and c-FLIP, subconfluent cells were treated with 1 μg/ml TRAIL-FLAG and 3 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 alone or in the presence of KN-93 (100 μm) or caspases inhibitors at 37 °C for the times indicated. At each time point, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail). After centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were subjected to Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation for DISC analysis was performed according to a modified protocol as reported previously (6Bodmer J.-L. Holler J. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J.

Cells (5 × 107) were stimulated with 1 μg/ml TRAIL-FLAG and 3 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 for 30 min at 37 °C with or without 20 μm z-IETD-fmk pretreatment. The cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer. In unstimulated controls, 1 μg of TRAIL-FLAG and 1 μg of anti-FLAG M2 were added after lysis to immunoprecipitate nonstimulated death receptors. The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG1-agarose overnight at 4 °C and analyzed by Western blotting and two-dimensional PAGE immunoblotting. For each sample, 107 cells were either treated with 100 μmKN-93 for 16 h at 37 °C or left untreated and lysed in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 65 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail. After centrifugation, the supernatants were precipitated with acetone. The pellets were redissolved in 9.8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG buffer (pH 4–7), and 65 mm dithiothreitol, applied by rehydration in 13-cm DryStrips (pH 4–7), and electrofocused with IPGphorTM System following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The strips were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by nitrocellulose membrane transferring (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotting. For DISC analysis, the immunoprecipitated samples were eluted from beads with 9.8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG buffer (pH 4–7), and 100 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 1 h and then subjected to two-dimensional PAGE immunoblotting. For Western blot, cell extracts and immunoprecipitated samples were separated through SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl), and 0.5% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: anti-DR5 and anti-caspase-8 (1:1000), anti-caspase-3 and anti-PED (1:5000), anti-caspase-10 and anti-ERK1/2 (1:500), anti-FADD (1:250), and anti-cFLIP (1:10). The membranes were washed in TTBS (TBS and 1% Tween 20) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies diluted in TTBS: anti-mouse κ-HRP, anti-mouse IgG2b-HRP, and anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (1:20,000) and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5000). The blots were washed and developed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Jurkat cells express DR5, but not DR4, and can be killed by TRAIL through apoptosis (16Sprick M.R.

DISC analysis in parental Jurkat cells and their FADDdef and caspase-8def clones has established that TRAIL induces incorporation of DR5, FADD, and caspase-8 into the DISC (6Bodmer J.-L. Holler J.

Taking advantage of this system, we examined these cells to determine if caspase-10 is recruited to the DISC to initiate apoptosis independent of caspase-8. We stimulated the cells with TRAIL-FLAG/M2 for 30 min, at which time a maximal recruitment of all the signaling proteins was observed (6Bodmer J.-L. Holler J. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P.

The DISC was immunoprecipitated and examined by Western blot to identify the DISC proteins. Western blots revealed DR5, FADD, caspase-8, and caspase-10 in the TRAIL-induced DISC in the stimulated parental Jurkat cells (Fig.1 A). Four caspase-10 bands were detected: caspase-10 precursors (p59 and p54) and their corresponding fragments that contain prodomain still attached to the large subunit (p47 and p43), indicating that caspase-10 is recruited to and completes its first-step cleavage in the DISC. This was quickly followed by the further cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-10, as shown by the appearance of the active p18 form of caspase-8 (Fig.1 B) and the p27 prodomain form of caspase-10 (Fig.1 D). We further examined downstream caspase-3 and found that caspase-3 was proteolytically processed to produce the active p20 and p18 forms (Fig. 1 D). Stimulation of the Jurkat cells with TRAIL-FLAG/M2 resulted in extensive cell death, as demonstrated by crystal violet analysis (Fig. 1 C). Caspase-10 proteins (p59, p54, p47, and p43) were also detected in TRAIL-induced DISC in the caspase-8def clone, but not in the FADDdef clone (Fig. 1 A), indicating that FADD is required for caspase-10 recruitment. TRAIL-FLAG/M2 triggered cell death in the caspase-8def clone, but it was delayed and inefficient as compared with that seen in the parental cells (Fig.1 C). This delayed cell death occurred through activation of caspase-10 and caspase-3, as evidenced by the appearance of p27 caspase-10 prodomain and caspase-3 p20 and p18 forms on Western blot at 48 h (Fig. 1 D). Treatment of caspase-8defcells with z-AVED-fmk, a caspase-10-specific inhibitor, abolished TRAIL-FLAG/M2-induced cell death (Fig. 1 C) and activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 1 D), further indicating that caspase-10 is an initiator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis independent of caspase-8. We further investigated TRAIL-induced recruitment of caspase-8 and caspase-10 to initiate apoptosis in tumor cells. To this end, we analyzed the TRAIL-induced DISC in malignant glioma cell lines (LN-18, T98G, and U343MG) that express DR5 and undergo extensive apoptosis upon TRAIL stimulation (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar). In TRAIL-FLAG/M2-stimulated cells, Western blots detected caspase-8 precursors (p55 and p53) and their first cleavage products (p43 and p41) and caspase-10 precursors (p59 and p54) and their cleavage fragments (p47 and p43) (Fig.2 A). These findings indicated that both caspase-8 and caspase-10 are recruited and complete their first-step cleavage in the DISC. DR5 proteins (49 and 43 kDa) and FADD (25 kDa) were also detected in the DISC, indicating that caspase-8 and caspase-10 recruitment to DR5 requires FADD. This DISC formation was quickly followed by further cleavage of caspase-8 to produce active p18 subunits and of caspase-10 to produce p27 fragments (Fig.2 B). Caspase-3 was also cleaved into active p20 and p18 products (Fig. 2 B), and extensive cell death was observed in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2 C). Our previous studies showed that z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8-specific inhibitor, partially protects glioma cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that caspase-10 may be responsible for apoptosis in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated U343MG cells with 20 μm z-IETD-fmk for 2 h and then stimulated the cells with TRAIL-FLAG/M2. DISC analysis revealed recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC (Fig. 2 A), but its further cleavage was inhibited by z-IETD-fmk (Fig. 2 B). Caspase-10 was also recruited to the DISC, where it was proteolytically processed (Fig. 2 A) and further activated downstream caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B), resulting in a maximal 50% cell death (Fig. 2 C). The activation of these caspases and cell death were abolished by the presence of z-AEVD-fmk, a caspase-10 inhibitor (Fig. 2, Band C). These findings indicate that caspase-10 is an independent initiator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in glioma cells as well. Many glioma cell lines are resistant to TRAIL (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism of this resistance remains unclear. To investigate this, we analyzed the DISC in glioma cell lines (LN-215, LN-464, and LN-443) that are resistant to TRAIL-FLAG/M2-induced apoptosis, as determined by crystal violet assay for cell death and by Western blotting for caspase-3 activation (data not shown). We first examined caspase-8 to determine if its function as an apoptosis initiator is impaired in TRAIL-resistant cells. Western blots detected capase-8 precursors (p55 and p53) and its first-step cleavage fragments (p43 and p41) in the DISC (Fig.3 A). It appeared, therefore, that caspase-8 is recruited to and proteolytically cleaved in the DISC. Western blots further revealed DR5 and FADD in the DISC, indicating that this first-step cleavage of caspase-8 requires DISC assembly. However, failure to detect active p18 subunits of caspase-8 in these cells upon TRAIL-FLAG/M2 stimulation (data not shown) suggested that further cleavage of caspase-8 in the DISC is inhibited. In contrast to caspase-8, caspase-10 was not detected by Western blotting in the TRAIL-resistant LN-215, LN-464, and LN-443 lines (Fig.3 A). To investigate the molecular mechanisms of caspase-10 absence, we first compared the protein expression levels of caspase-8 and caspase-10 in TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant cells. Western blot showed that caspase-8 precursors (p55 and p53) were expressed at similar levels in both TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant cell lines but that much lower levels of caspase-10 precursors (p59 and p54) were detected in TRAIL-resistant cells (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the protein expression levels of caspase-8 and caspase-10 influence their recruitment to the DISC by competing for DED binding sites on FADD. To further examine this hypothesis, we examined the LN-405 cell line that is resistant to TRAIL (data not shown) but expresses high levels of caspase-10 (Fig. 3 B). Indeed, DISC analysis of LN-405 cells showed that both caspase-8 and caspase-10 were recruited to and cleaved in the DISC (Fig. 3 A). The DED-containing protein c-FLIP interacts with FADD to block caspase-8 recruitment to the DISC in transfectants (20Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Our finding that caspase-8 is recruited to the DISC suggested an alternative mechanism. We examined TRAIL-FLAG/M2 immunoprecipitated samples to look for c-FLIP in the DISC. Both c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS were expressed in TRAIL-resistant cells, as detected by Western blot analysis of cell extracts (Fig. 3 A). Detection of a weaker band of p55 c-FLIPL and a dense new band of p43 products in the DISC indicated that c-FLIPL was recruited to and proteolytically cleaved in the DISC to produce its intermediate p43 form. The short form, c-FLIPS (p25), was also detected in the DISC (Fig. 3 A). Kinetic analysis on Western blots of c-FLIPL cleavage revealed that its intermediate p43 forms were produced in the TRAIL-resistant cells, but not in the TRAIL-sensitive cells, upon TRAIL stimulation (Fig. 4). Both TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant cells showed first-step cleavage of caspase-8 in the DISC (Figs. 2 A and 3 A), but it appeared that simultaneous recruitment of caspase-8 and c-FLIPL to the DISC resulted in c-FLIPLcleavage into intermediate products in TRAIL-resistant cells (Fig.3 A). Detection of caspase-8 precursors (p55 and p53) and its first-step cleavage products (p43 and p41) (Fig. 3 A), together with c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL intermediate p43 (Fig. 3 A), suggested that both forms of c-FLIP might be responsible for inhibiting further cleavage of caspase-8 in the DISC. PED/PEA-15 is an additional DED-containing protein that inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of the DISC revealed PED/PEA-15 in the TRAIL-resistant glioma cells (Fig.3 A), but not in the TRAIL-sensitive cells (data not shown). We reported previously that PED/PEA-15 antiapoptotic function depends on its phosphorylation (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore we proposed that the phosphorylation status of PED/PEA-15 protein may influence its recruitment. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant glioma cells for their expression of PED/PEA-15 isoforms. Two-dimensional PAGE immunoblotting detected unphosphorylated (N), singly phosphorylated (Pa), and doubly phosphorylated Pb forms of PED/PEA-15 in TRAIL-resistant LN-215 cells, but detected only N and Pa forms in TRAIL-sensitive U343MG cells. Next, we examined the TRAIL-FLAG/M2 immunoprecipitated samples from LN-215 cells on two-dimensional PAGE immunoblot to determine the isoform(s) of PED/PEA-15 in the DISC. As shown in Fig.5 A, only the Pb form was present in the DISC, indicating that double phosphorylation of PED/PEA-15 is required for its recruitment to the DISC. We then treated LN-215 cells with KN-93, a CaMK inhibitor (37Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), to inhibit PED/PEA-15 phosphorylation and analyzed the isoform(s) of PED/PEA-15 present in the cells. Exposure of LN-215 cells to 100 μm KN-93 for 16 h greatly reduced the Pb form (Fig. 5 A). Further exposure of KN-93 treated LN-215 cells to TRAIL-FLAG/M2 resulted in cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Fig. 5 B) and significantly increased cell death in this TRAIL-resistant cell line (Fig. 5 C). The signal transduction in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and its inhibition in nontransfected tumor cells remain largely unknown. Understanding of these signaling events that control tumor cell death could provide therapeutic potentials for tumors. In the present study, we dissected TRAIL-induced DISC for the first time in TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant malignant glioma cells to reveal the molecular mechanisms in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and its modulation. Apoptosis-initiating protease caspase-8 molecules are recruited via FADD to the DR5 to form DISCs, where the caspase-8 is proteolytically cleaved to produce its first-step cleavage products in both TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant cells. Caspase-8 is further cleaved to the products that activate downstream caspase-3, resulting in cell death in TRAIL-sensitive glioma cells. These results are in accord with DISC analysis in transfectants and Jurkat cells (5Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells, further cleavage of caspase-8 is inhibited. We further showed for the first time that caspase-10 is also recruited to the DISC in both TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant glioma cells. Caspase-10 was reported to have four isoforms, three of which (caspase-10/a, caspase-10/b, and caspase-10/d) contain a protease domain that is functional in transfectants (38Ng P.W. Porter A.G. Janicke R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10301-10308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, recent studies revealed only caspase-10/a and caspase-10/d in nontransfected B and T cells (17Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Wirmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J.

Failure to detect caspase-10 in the DISC in previous studies (6Bodmer J.-L. Holler J. Reynard S. Vinciguerra P. Schneider P. Juo P. Blenis J. Tschopp J. Nat.

Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Wirmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 13884-13888Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and showed that caspase-10 is recruited to and cleaved in the TRAIL-induced DISC. Caspase-10 recruitment is detected in some but not other cell lines, which correlates well with its protein expression levels in the cells. Recruitment of caspase-10 to the DISC triggers apoptosis in the presence of caspase-8-specific inhibitor, indicating that caspase-10 is an apoptosis initiator independent of caspase-8. Our observation that c-FLIP and PED/PEA-15 are recruited to the DISC may explain why further cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-10 is inhibited in TRAIL-resistant cells. A large number of c-FLIP and PED/PEA-15 molecules in the proximity of caspase-8 and caspase-10 in the DISC may prevent further cleavage of the caspases according to the induced proximity model (12Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). c-FLIPL is recruited to and cleaved into intermediate fragments in the DISC. This occurs simultaneously with caspase-8 recruitment and first-step cleavage, suggesting that both events may contribute to each other. Indeed, a recent study with transfectants showed that c-FLIPLrecruitment contributes to caspase-8 first-step cleavage in the DISC, where the c-FLIPL intermediate form inhibits further cleavage of caspase-8 (17Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Wirmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the molecular basis for the difference in c-FLIP and PED/PEA-15 recruitment in TRAIL-resistant and -sensitive tumor cells. Expression of c-FLIP in melanoma cells was reported to correlate with their sensitivity to TRAIL (19Griffith T.S. Chin W.A. Jackson G.C. Lynch D.H. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar), but additional studies in melanoma (40Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar) and glioma cells (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar) failed to confirm this correlation. It appears that c-FLIP antiapoptotic functions are modulated by its phosphorylation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway in tumor cells (41Panka D.J. Mano T. Suhara T. Walsh K. Mier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6893-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which this signaling pathway regulates c-FLIP expression status and/or antiapoptotic function remains to be investigated. We have reported that inhibition of PED/PEA-15 phosphorylation restored TRAIL sensitivity in TRAIL-resistant cells (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we further showed that treatment with KN-93 (a CaMK inhibitor) (37Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) largely rescued the cell sensitivity to TRAIL. A doubly phosphorylated form of PED/PEA-15 is recruited to the DISC in TRAIL-resistant cells, indicating that phosphorylation of PED/PEA-15 is required for its recruitment to the DISC. Doubly phosphorylated PED/PEA-15 proteins are expressed in TRAIL-resistant but not TRAIL-sensitive cells, further indicating a significant difference in the upstream mechanisms that control phosphorylation of PED/PEA-15 in TRAIL-resistant cells compared with TRAIL-sensitive cells. Further investigation of functions of CaMK, protein kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways in glioma cells will shed some light on the complex regulatory mechanisms that control tumor cell death and survival.

The interlayer anion is much more important than the cation in determining the solubility of the hydrotalcite phase and its ability to contain or release heavy metals to the environment. Because hydrotalcites do not have an unreactive polymer as a structural core, their aqueous stability will change dramatically with composition, particularly with anion content.

The ability of MD-2 to multimerize was confirmed, and MD-1 was also shown to possess this ability. Through site-directed mutagenesis, more than two intermolecular disulfide bonds were found to stabilize the MD-2 multimer. MD-2's abilities to confer LPS responsiveness and to bind TLR4 were strongly associated functions.

Although ClC-2 is clearly the inwardly rectifying anion channel in several tissues, the molecular identity of the hyperpolarization-activated Cl− current in other organs, including the salivary gland, is currently unknown. To determine the nature of the hyperpolarization-activated Cl− current and to examine the role of ClC-2 in salivary gland function, a mouse line containing a targeted disruption of theClcn2 gene was generated. The resulting homozygousClcn2 −/− mice lacked detectable hyperpolarization-activated chloride currents in parotid acinar cells and, as described previously, displayed postnatal degeneration of the retina and testis. The magnitude and biophysical characteristics of the volume- and calcium-activated chloride currents in these cells were unaffected by the absence of ClC-2.

Indeed, a null mutation in theClcn2 gene resulted in the loss of hyperpolarization-activated anion currents in Leydig and Sertoli cells (1Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Inwardly rectifying Cl− currents have qualitatively similar properties in numerous tissues, nevertheless, unique activation kinetics are often observed in different cell types and in heterologous ClC-2 expression systems. For example, under identical experimental conditions, the chloride current generated by recombinant rat ClC-2 in HEK293 cells activates with a faster time course than the current in rat salivary acinar cells (2Park K. Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, cAMP is an important regulator of recombinant human ClC-2 channel activity (3Tewari K.P. Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C40-C50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of hyperpolarization-activated Cl− currents in both choroid plexus (4Kibble J.D. Trezise A.E. Brown P.D. J.

Biol. 2001; 182: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these contrary results is differential expression of a regulatory subunit that modulates channel kinetics. Alternatively, splice variants of ClC-2 may alter the activation properties of this channel (7Chu S. Zeitlin P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Cid L.P. Niemeyer M.I. Ramirez A. Sepulveda F.V. Am. J.

However, analysis of the currents in choroid plexus epithelial cells from ClC-2 knockout animals failed to reveal a loss of the hyperpolarization-activated Cl− conductance (9Speake T. Kajita H. Smith C.P. Brown P.D. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These later results demonstrate that another novel gene encodes the inwardly rectifying Cl− current present in choroid plexus cells and raises the possibility that the hyperpolarization-activated Cl− channel in salivary gland cells and other cell types is not ClC-2. The physiological importance of some epithelial chloride channels has been revealed by gene mutation-inducing diseases such as cystic fibrosis (10Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N.

In mice lacking ClC-2, degeneration of the retina and testis occurs, indicating that this chloride channel is required for the survival of cells that depend on epithelia forming blood-organ barriers (1Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this barrier function is related to the regulation of ClC-2 activity by extracellular pH (13Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 541: 103-112Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or cell swelling (15Gründer S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The apical location of the ClC-2 channel in rat small intestine, renal, and airway epithelia further suggests that ClC-2 plays a role in regulating fluid and electrolyte movement in these tissues (16Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M., Li, C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Murray C.B. Chu S. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L829-L837PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, antisense ClC-2 cDNA reduced native chloride current in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 and significantly reduced Cl−-dependent secretion (16Mohammad-Panah R. Gyomorey K. Rommens J. Choudhury M., Li, C. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8306-8313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has provided important and sometimes surprising insights into the function of several chloride channels. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of the physiological significance of ClC-2 and other chloride channels in most epithelia remains to be determined. Functional analysis is complicated in native epithelial cells, because multiple types of chloride channels are typically present. Salivary gland acinar cells are no exception, expressing at least five distinct chloride conductances (18Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Arreola J. Park K. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The first of these to be characterized (20Iwatsuki N. Maruyama Y. Matsumoto O. Nishiyama A. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1985; 35: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is activated by an increase in intracellular free [Ca2+] i (21Arreola J. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is likely that the Ca2+-dependent Cl− channel is targeted to the apical membrane in parotid acinar cells as has been shown in pancreatic acinar cells (22Park M.K. Lomax R.B. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10948-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because salivation is Ca2+-dependent (23Melvin J.E. Koek L. Zhang G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G1043-G1050PubMed Google Scholar, 24Martinez J.R. Petersen O.H. Experientia (Basel). 1972; 28: 167-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Douglas W.W. Poisner A.M. J. Physiol. 1963; 165: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-gated Cl− channel has been predicted to be the primary Cl− channel activated during stimulated secretion. Additional Cl− channels found in salivary gland cells include those that are volume-sensitive (26Arreola J. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Physiol. 1995; 484: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent (18Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1996; 490: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and channels with properties like ClC-0 (18Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The complexity created by the expression of multiple chloride channels in acinar cells indicates that gene knockout model systems will likely be required to unequivocally assign function to an individual channel. Therefore, we disrupted the Clcn2 gene to: 1) elucidate the molecular nature of the inwardly rectifying Cl− current in salivary acinar cells; 2) determine the role of ClC-2 in saliva secretion; and 3) examine whether ClC-2 is critical for cell volume regulation. Patch-clamp analysis of chloride currents in salivary gland acinar cells demonstrated the loss of inwardly rectifying current inClcn2 −/− mice. In contrast, no changes were observed in the calcium- or volume-activated chloride conductances. Despite suggestions that ClC-2 may be involved in volume regulation, acinar cells from Clcn2 −/− mice recovered cell volume following swelling by hypotonic shock as well as those from wild-type littermates. Furthermore, we show that the flow-rate of saliva secreted during in vivo stimulation, as well as the protein and electrolyte concentrations of the saliva, were comparable in wild-type and Clcn2 −/− mice. These data unequivocally identity Clcn2 as the gene that encodes for the inwardly rectifying Cl− channel in salivary acinar cells and demonstrate that the Cl− currents required for stimulated secretion of saliva are mediated by other channels such as the Ca2+- and/or volume-activated Cl−channels. A clone isolated from a 129/SVJ mouse genomic lambda library was used to construct a targeting vector with a neomycin-resistance (neo) gene as a positive selection marker and thymidine kinase gene as a negative selection marker. A 3.07-kb high fidelity PCR product obtained from a sub-cloned SstI fragment from the Clcn2 gene was inserted 3′ of the neo cassette, and a 2.3-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment was inserted 5′ of the neo cassette (see Fig. 1 A). The neo cassette was designed to replace 1 kb of promoter and ∼500 nucleotides of 5′-UTR1 as well as exon 1 and most of exon 2 of the Clcn2 gene. However, after blunt-end cloning the 5′-fragment, a clone containing the wrong orientation of the 5′-arm was mistakenly identified and subsequently linearized and electroporated into KG ES cells. Southern blotting ofEcoRI-digested genomic DNA from targeted ES cell clones using a 1.3-kb outside probe (3′ of the sequence used to create the targeting vector, as indicated in Fig. 1 A) led to the identification of a recombinant clonal isolate exhibiting the predicted 11- to 7-kb shift in size (Fig. 1 C). Further characterization of this clone indicated that homologous recombination had taken place between the 3′-arm of the targeting vector and the genomic DNA, as well as between an unidentified segment of the 5′-arm of the targeting vector and a region slightly downstream of the 3′-end of the genomic copy of the 5′-arm (possibly due to the presence of long stretches of repetitive sequence in this area). Although this clone did not delete the promoter of the Clcn2 gene, the replacement of most of exons 1 and 2 with PGKneo was expected to and did, in fact, result in the loss of both the ClC-2 transcript and protein in the final homozygous animal, as determined by RT-PCR and Western analysis (Fig. 1 D). The generation of the anti-ClC2 antibody has been described previously (27Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-C1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a kind gift of C. Bear (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). Amino acids 16–35 of rat ClC-2 contain the target sequence to which the antibody was raised. The targeted ES cell clone was injected into C57BL/6 blastocytes to generate chimeras that were backcrossed against the C57BL/6 strain. Germline transmission was assessed by Southern blotting, and heterozygous offspring were crossed to create the F2 animals used in the present study. In all cases, littermates were paired for each set of experiments. The general phenotype of ourClcn2 −/− strain was essentially indistinguishable from that reported recently by the Jentsch laboratory (1Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For histological examination, adultClcn2 +/+ and Clcn2 −/−age- and sex-matched littermates (7–8 weeks of age) were anesthetized with 300 mg of chloral hydrate/kg of body weight (intraperitoneally) and the tissues were fixed by perfusion with 10% neutral buffered formalin, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature from freshly isolated single parotid acinar cells using the patch clamp technique (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar). An Axopatch 200 B amplifier (Axon Instruments Corp., Foster City, CA) was used to voltage clamp and record the resulting chloride currents. Voltage clamp protocols to activate channels were generated by pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments Corp.). Chloride currents were filtered at 1 kHz using a low pass Bessel filter and digitized at 2 kHz. A glass pipette had a 2- to 4-MΩ resistance when filled with the internal solutions. To record hyperpolarization-activated chloride currents, cells were dialyzed with an internal solution containing (millimolar): TEA-Cl 140, EGTA 20, HEPES 20, pH 7.3 with TEA-OH. Calcium-dependent chloride channel currents were recorded from cells dialyzed with an internal solution containing (millimolar): NMDG-glutamate 80, NMDG-EGTA 50, CaCl2 30, HEPES 20, pH 7.3 with NMDG. The free calcium concentration of this solution was estimated to be 250 nm(WinMax 2, Stanford CA). Cells were bathed in an external hypertonic solution containing (millimolar): TEA-Cl 140, CaCl2 0.5,d-mannitol 100, HEPES 20, pH 7.3 with TEA-OH; volume-sensitive currents were activated by diluting this solution 20% with water and using the same internal solution as described above for recording hyperpolarization-activated chloride currents. Square pulses of 5 or 3 s were delivered every 7 s from a holding potential of 0 (hyperpolarization-activated and volume-sensitive currents) or −50 mV (calcium-dependent currents). Membrane potential was changed between −120 to +120 mV in 20-mV steps, and the resulting currents were recorded after 10 (hyperpolarization-activated) and 5 (volume-sensitive and calcium-dependent currents) min of dialysis. Junction potentials (4.5 mV) and leak currents were not corrected. Current-voltage relationships were constructed by plotting the absolute magnitude of the currents at the end of the pulse against the membrane potential. Parotid acinar cell clumps from adult (8–10 weeks old) Clcn2 +/+ andClcn2 −/− littermates were prepared by collagenase digestion as previously described (29Evans R.L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29025-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by exsanguination following exposure to CO2 gas. The parotid glands were quickly removed, trimmed of connective tissues, and finely minced in 7.5 ml of collagenase digestion medium (Eagle's minimal essential medium, Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) containing 0.04 mg/ml collagenase P and 1% BSA. The minced glands were incubated at 37 °C in a shaker with continuous agitation (100 cycles/min) and under gas (95%O2 + 5%CO2). After the first 20-min interval the minced glands were dispersed by gentle pipetting (10 times) and centrifuged (210 × g for 15 s). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 7.5 ml of collagenase digestion medium for an additional 40 min with pipetting at 20-min intervals. The cells were then rinsed and harvested by centrifugation. Single cell preparations for electrophysiology utilized an initial 10-min digestion of the minced parotid tissue in 12.5 ml of trypsin digestion media (minimal essential medium, Spinner modification (SMEM), Biofluids, Inc.) containing 0.01% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1% BSA under 95%O2 + 5%CO2 gassing and while shaking (60 cycles/min). The cells were pelleted at 210 ×g for 15 s then washed with 10 ml of trypsin inhibitor solution (SMEM containing 0.2% trypsin inhibitor and 1% BSA). The cells were spun again and incubated in collagenase digestion solution as described above. Single cells were rinsed with BSA-free basal medium Eagle, selected by filtration through 53-μm nylon mesh, and attached to circular 5-mm polylysine-coated glass coverslides in a 37 °C incubator containing 95%O2 + 5%CO2. Cell volume was estimated using a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope interfaced with an Axon Imaging Workbench System (Novato, CA). The dispersed acinar cells were loaded with the fluoroprobe calcein by incubation for 15 min at room temperature with 100% O2 in 2 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Dye-loaded cells were exposed to 490-nm light, and emitted fluorescence was measured at 530 nm. Changes in cell volume were monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity of calcein within a delimited intracellular volume. Cell volume was expressed in arbitrary units as 1/normalized calcein fluorescence. Calcein-loaded acinar cell clumps were equilibrated in an isotonic physiological solution containing (in millimolar): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.4 KH2PO4, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 20 Hepes, 10 glucose, 0.8 MgSO4, and 1.2 CaCl2, pH 7.4. Hypotonic challenge was induced by switching the perfusate to the above solution after diluting by 30% with water. Cell volume change was measured as described above. Regulatory volume decrease (RVD) was followed over the course of ∼300 s while the cells remained in the hypotonic solution, and the rate of volume recovery was calculated by determining the slope of the best-fit line following the switch to hypotonic media and maximum cell swelling. Some experiments used clotrimazole (Sigma Chemical Co.) at a final concentration of 1 μm present in all of the solutions, and others used zinc at a final concentration of 50 μm. Adult littermates Clcn2 +/+ andClcn2 −/− (7–8 weeks of age) were anesthetized with 300 mg of chloral hydrate/kg of body weight (intraperitoneally) and then stimulated with 10 mg of pilocarpine-HCl/kg of body weight (intraperitoneally). Whole saliva, primarily representing a combination of parotid and submandibular secretions, with a very minor component from sublingual and minor salivary, nasal, and tracheal glands, was collected from the lower cheek pouch by a suction device at intervals of 5, 10, and 15 min. The protein concentration of saliva was determined using the Bradford method. Total sodium and potassium contents in saliva samples were determined by atomic absorption using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 3030 spectrophotometer. Saliva osmolality was measured using a Wescor 5500 vapor pressure osmometer, and chloride activity was determined using an Orion EA 940 expandable ion analyzer. A lambda genomic DNA library derived from 129/SVJ mice was screened using a probe specific for the Clcn2 gene. Genomic fragments from the resulting lambda clone were used to flank a positive (PGKneo) selection cassette in a vector designed to target the Clcn2 gene for disruption (Fig. 1 A). The construct was intended to replace a genomic segment that includes a portion of the Clcn2 promoter and 5′-UTR, as well as all of exon 1 and most of exon 2, with PGKneo. This strategy was expected to result in the inability to initiate transcription from the defunctClcn2 promoter in the transgenic strain, causing an absence of functional protein, thereby avoiding the possibility of a dominant negative effect caused by expression of a truncated protein. During the gene-targeting procedure, a construct with the upstream arm in the wrong orientation was mistakenly utilized. Electroporation of this construct into embryonic stem cells resulted in a single targeted cell line (out of ∼900 neomycin-resistant clones; Fig. 1 C) resulting from a hybrid homologous recombination/insertion event, as described below. After the mistake was recognized we learned that the promoter of another gene, encoding the RPB-17 protein, overlaps that ofClcn2 in rat (30Chu S. Blaisdell C.J. Liu M.Z. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L614-L624PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in mouse. 2K. Nehrke, unpublished observations. Because the correct construct would disrupt both genes, we proceeded to analyze the embryonic stem cell clone that we had identified. Analysis using both inside and outside probes as well as genomic PCR (data not shown) demonstrated that homologous recombination occurred between the 3′-arm of the targeting vector and the Clcn2gene. This was followed by a non-homologous insertion event in the upstream (backwardly oriented) arm (Fig. 1 B). The junction between the genomic and vector DNA was not mapped at the single nucleotide level due to a stretch of over 1500 nucleotides of up to 85% GC content, which precluded genomic PCR across that region. The final homozygous knockout strain was shown to lack ClC-2 protein by Western analysis (Fig. 1 D). In addition, RT-PCR with primers to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the transcript confirmed that ClC-2 message was not present in the knockout strain, whereas Northern analysis indicated that the RPB-17 mRNA, whose promoter overlaps that ofClcn2, but in the antisense orientation, was present at normal levels in the Clcn2 −/− animal (data not shown). The phenotype of the Clcn2 −/−strain generated in our laboratory is comparable to that reported recently (1Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The mice appeared generally healthy and displayed normal behavior and body weight, but histological examination of semi-thin sections revealed abnormalities of the eye and testis. Unlike the wild-type eye (Fig. 2 A), the knockout exhibited post-natal degeneration of the retina, reflected by a gradual loss of photoreceptor cells and the outer nuclear layer, which was not present or remained as only a few cells adjacent to the inner nuclear layer (Fig. 2, B and C). Maturation of the testes was normal in wild-type mice (Fig.3 A) but was impaired in the knockout (Fig. 3 B). In Clcn2 −/−mice at the age of sexual maturity, the germ cell layers were missing, and no mature spermatozoa were present; in addition, there was hyperplasia of the Leydig cells and abnormal Sertoli cells were prominent and widespread (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Histology of the testis. 5-μm sections of testis from a Clcn2 +/+ male (A) and Clcn2 −/− male (B) obtained 10 weeks after birth. The normal testicular architecture found in the +/+ mice is compromised in theClcn2 −/− animal, with missing germ cell layers (double-headed arrow in the +/+ control), abnormal Sertoli cells (small arrows) and a relative hyperplasia of the Leydig cells (large arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The homozygous knockout strain was used to assess the molecular nature of the inwardly rectifying Cl− current and to determine the role of ClC-2 in saliva gland function and fluid secretion from salivary acinar cells. The production of saliva is initiated by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ that opens Ca2+-dependent chloride channels on the apical membranes of the acinar cells. Anion fluxes in parotid acinar cells are mediated by at least five distinct chloride currents, namely, volume-sensitive, calcium-dependent, cAMP-activated, ClC-0-like, and hyperpolarization-activated channels (18Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32956-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Arreola J. Park K. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RT-PCR has demonstrated the presence of ClC-2 in parotid acini, and the characteristics of the hyperpolarization-activated chloride current in this cell type are quantitatively similar to that of the cloned ClC-2 channel (2Park K. Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To unambiguously determine the molecular identity of the channel mediating this current, we performed patch clamp analysis on single parotid acinar cells isolated from wild-type andClcn2 −/− mice. The chloride currents recorded from wild-type parotid acinar cells using the whole cell configuration (Fig. 4, upper left trace) displayed inward rectification and time dependence, as has been observed previously (2Park K. Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Arreola J. Park K. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To clearly monitor the hyperpolarization-activated chloride currents, it was necessary to eliminate the Ca2+-dependent and the volume-sensitive currents. This was accomplished using an internal pipette solution containing the calcium chelator EGTA and a hypertonic bath solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). Relative to acini from wild-type mice, currents for the acini ofClcn2 −/− mice decreased more than 10-fold in magnitude at the most negative potentials and exhibited no rectification (Fig. 4, upper right trace). The lower panels show the current-voltage (IV) relations of chloride currents for parotid acinar cells derived from multiple Clcn2 +/+ (left, n = 6) and Clcn2 −/− (right, n = 8) mice. A similar analysis of heterozygousClcn2 +/− mice revealed similar hyperpolarization-activated currents as present in wild-type acinar cells, suggesting that there is no dominant negative effect (data not shown). These results confirm that the ClC-2 channel is, in fact, responsible for the hyperpolarization-activated Cl−current in parotid acinar cells. Because the opening of the Ca2+-activated Cl−channel on"

We previously demonstrated that heterotrimeric G proteins of the G12 subfamily comprised of Gα12 and Gα13 interact with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins and cause the release of the transcriptional activator β-catenin (Meigs, T. E., Fields, T. A., McKee, D. D., and Casey, P. J. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 519–524). Because of the importance of β-catenin in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, we examined whether G12 subfamily proteins could also regulate cadherin function. The introduction of mutationally activated G12proteins into K562 cells expressing E-cadherin blocked cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in steady-state assays. Also, in breast cancer cells, the introduction of activated G12 proteins blocked E-cadherin function in a fast aggregation assay. Aggregation mediated by a mutant cadherin that lacks G12 binding ability was not affected by activated G12 proteins, indicating a requirement for direct G12-cadherin interaction. Furthermore, in wound-filling assays in which ectopic expression of E-cadherin inhibits cell migration, the expression of activated G12 proteins reversed the inhibition via a mechanism that was independent of G12-mediated Rho activation. These results validate the G12-cadherin interaction as a potentially important event in cell biology and suggest novel roles for G12 proteins in the regulation of cadherin-mediated developmental events and in the loss of cadherin function that is characteristic of metastatic tumor progression.

Classical cadherins are single-pass transmembrane proteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion in a Ca2+-dependent manner and are found in nearly all of the solid tissues (1Gumbiner B.M. J.

The successful completion of many steps during early embryonic development depends on the ability to regulate cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in a spatial and temporal manner (4Tepass U. Curr.

In addition, a growing body of evidence has implicated cadherins as tumor suppressor proteins. For example, malignant tumor cells often exhibit a loss of cadherin function that coincides with the transition to an invasive metastatic state (6Perl A.K. Wilgenbus P. Dahl U. Semb H. Christofori G.

The ability of cadherins to bind the transcriptional activator β-catenin at the plasma membrane may contribute to their tumor-suppressive function (10Gottardi C.J. Wong E. Gumbiner B.M. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), because unchecked accumulation of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus is believed to be a key causative agent in a variety of cancers (12Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3496) Google Scholar). We recently reported a surprising connection between cadherins and the G12 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins that is comprised of Gα12 and Gα13 (13Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Mutationally activated G12 proteins were found to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins in a fashion that caused a release of β-catenin from cadherin. In subsequent studies, the Gα12 binding region of E-cadherin was mapped to an 11-residue highly charged domain near the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail (14Kaplan D.D. Meigs T.E. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44037-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This unexpected connection between heterotrimeric G proteins and the cadherin/catenin system was bolstered by another recent study in which certain prostanoid receptors previously proposed to couple to G12 proteins (15Pierce K.L.

Although a direct molecular mechanism for the transforming capability of G12 proteins has not been described, the ability of G12 proteins noted above to induce the release of β-catenin from cadherin may be a key component of such a mechanism (13Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaplan D.D. Meigs T.E. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44037-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Whereas previous studies provided evidence for the effect of G12-cadherin interaction on “inward” signaling associated with cadherin function, i.e. re-localization of membrane-associated β-catenin to the cytoplasm and nucleus, the role of this interaction in “outward” signaling, i.e.cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, had not yet been investigated. In this report, we demonstrate that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is down-regulated by mutationally activated G12 subfamily proteins. This effect is specific to the G12 subfamily, because other activated Gα proteins do not mimic this effect. In addition, we show that activated G12 proteins hinder the ability of E-cadherin to prevent cell detachment and migration in a wound-filling assay. These results suggest that G12-cadherin interaction may play an important role in cellular events leading to cancer metastasis and in cadherin-mediated multicellular events during organismal development. K562 human myelogenous leukemia cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. MDA-MB-435 cells were obtained from Michael Kinch (Medimmune, Gaithersburg, MD). This isolate expresses neither E-cadherin nor N-cadherin. The expression vector pXEH2 encoding human E-cadherin was provided by Yutaka Shimoyama (National Okura Hospital, Tokyo, Japan). The expression vector pBATEM2 (40Nose A. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell. 1988; 54: 993-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) encoding full-length mouse E-cadherin was obtained from Masatoshi Takeichi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Adenovirus shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV and adenovirus backbone vector pAdEasy-1 were provided by Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The antibody for Gα12 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibodies for E-cadherin were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). To engineer the ΔG12 mutant form of E-cadherin, a 650-bp ClaI-Bsu36I DNA fragment encoding the mouse E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain with a deletion of the 11-amino acid G12 binding site (DQDQDYDYLNE) was produced using a two-step PCR approach. This fragment was then cloned into the E-cadherin expression vector pBATEM2 replacing the wild-type fragment and the altered region of the plasmid sequenced for verification. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)1 (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. MDA-MB-435 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). The transfections of K562 cells were performed as follows. Approximately 10 × 106 cells were centrifuged and then resuspended in 250 μl of K562 medium. Ethanol-precipitated DNA (25 μg) was resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without FBS and mixed with cells. The mixture was pulsed at 340 V for 10 ms using a T820 square-wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA). Cells were plated in complete K562 medium and 48 h later were given 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells were either grown in a single dish (crude transfection) or were dispensed into 96-well plates at varying dilutions (clonal transfection). For the latter condition, plates were incubated for 12 days with Geneticin replenished every 4 days. Plates with visible cell growth in <25% wells were expanded to larger wells and screened by immunoblot analysis for expression of the desired protein. MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cadherin constructs were co-transfected with pCMV-puro, and selection was performed using 1 μg/ml puromycin. Puromycin-resistant clones were isolated by ring cloning and screened for E-cadherin expression by immunofluorescent labeling with an anti-E-cadherin antibody. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding mutationally activated (QL) variants of Gα12 and Gαi2 were constructed as follows. Gα12QL was excised from pcDNA1 usingBamHI and XbaI and directionally subcloned into the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV at its BglII andXbaI restriction sites. Gαi2QL in pCMV was digested with EcoRI, blunted with Klenow, and re-digested with XbaI. The Gαi2QLinsert was subcloned into pAdTrack-CMV that was previously digested with SalI, blunted with Klenow, and re-digested withXbaI. Successful recombinants of pAdTrack-CMV were verified by sequencing and then transformed by electroporation along with the adenoviral backbone vector pAdEasy-1 into BJ5183 cells. The colonies were screened for recombinant pAdEasy-1 clones, and DNA was purified using a cesium chloride density gradient. Viral production was performed as described previously (41He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with recombinant pAdEasy-1 DNA and grown until roughly half of the cells were detached. Cells were then subjected to 4 cycles of freeze thawing using a dry ice/methanol mixture, extracts were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were collected and frozen. Because pAdEasy-1 recombinants contained a cDNA for green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by a separate CMV promoter, titers of recombinant adenoviruses were estimated by infection of HEK293 cells and subsequent microscopy to visually assess green fluorescence intensity. Cells were grown to 90% confluency in 10-cm plates, removed by the addition of trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and then resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/plate of cells. Adenoviral supernatant (20–50 μl, depending on titer) was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with agitation every 10 min. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS and plated in T-75 flasks for aggregation assays or six-well plates for wound-filling assays. This assay was performed as described previously (42Brackenbury R. Thiery J.P. Rutishauser U. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Brackenbury R. Rutishauser U. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells grown as monolayers to 60–90% confluency were washed twice in HCMF buffer (10 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4·7 H2O, 5.6 mmglucose, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2and then incubated in HCMF supplemented with 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.04% twice-crystallized trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) at 37 °C for 20 min. Following FBS addition to 20% to quench trypsin, cells were pelleted at 800 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in HCMF plus 10 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2, DNase I was added to 0.67 mg/ml, and cells were counted using a Coulter Z1 particle counter. 2 × 106cells next were placed in silicone-coated glass vials containing 2 ml of HCMF plus either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Vials were rotated at 90 rpm at 37 °C for 1 h, and then cell aggregation was assessed using an Eclipse® TE300 phase-contrast microscope (Nikon) at ×100 magnification. Cells were photographed using a SPOT® digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) with SPOT RT version 3.02 imaging software. For determination of the approximate size of cell aggregates, images were imported into Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.) and overlaid with a grid pattern to allow the measurement of the “surface” area of aggregates. All images were analyzed at the same scale in Photoshop, and measurements were recorded as “relative area units” for each aggregate. Approximately 48 h post-infection, the medium was aspirated from cells, and a 20-μl pipette tip was used to scratch a pattern of vertical and horizontal “wounds” in the monolayer. Cells were washed several times with fresh medium to remove detached cells and debris, and then Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS was added to cells. Roscovitine (20 μm) (Calbiochem) was also added to reduce cell proliferation. Several wounded areas were marked for orientation and then photographed by phase-contrast microscopy as in the cell aggregation assay. At a set time ranging from 33 to 39 h in each individual experiment, marked wounds were again photographed. The strength of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is markedly increased by the interaction of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of cadherin with β-catenin (44Barth A.I. Nathke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 45Behrens J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Given the previous findings that G12 subfamily proteins disrupt the association of cadherin and β-catenin (13Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kaplan D.D. Meigs T.E. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44037-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we predicted that the expression of mutationally activated Gα12 or Gα13 might disrupt cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the finding that K562 human myelogenous leukemia cells, which grow in suspension culture as free-floating cells, can be induced to form aggregates by ectopic expression of cadherin (46Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). K562 cells were stably transfected with a cDNA encoding human E-cadherin, and hygromycin-resistant clonal populations were selected. Consistent with the previous report (46Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), clonal populations that expressed E-cadherin also exhibited a dramatic change from dispersed cells to large aggregates, whereas clonal populations failing to express E-cadherin showed no such aggregation (Fig.1). To determine the effects of G12 proteins on cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, we next attempted to co-express various mutationally activated (QL) or wild-type (wt) G protein α-subunits along with E-cadherin in K562 cells. Because of difficulties encountered in transfecting the highly aggregated E-cadherin-expressing cells, clonal K562 cell lines stably expressing various Gα proteins were first established, and then secondary transfections were performed to introduce E-cadherin. Whereas K562 cells expressing GαzQL, Gαi2QL, Gα13wt, or no G protein still exhibited significant aggregation, cells expressing Gα13QL did not form aggregates (Fig. 2). These cells were essentially of the same appearance as K562 cells lacking E-cadherin (see Fig. 1). The quantitation of aggregation in the K562 cells expressing E-cadherin along with various Gα proteins was performed by visual analysis of the cell populations. For each sample, five random microscopic viewfields were selected, and the number of aggregates (defined as discrete clumps of cells that measured at ≥3-cell-diameters in breadth at the narrowest point and which remained intact as the plate was gently agitated) was counted. Cells co-transfected with E-cadherin and Gα13QL had <10% the average number of aggregates per viewfield compared with cells co-transfected with E-cadherin and empty vector, Gα13wt, GαzQL, or Gαi2QL (Fig.2 a). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that all transfectants expressed E-cadherin at similar levels (Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, all of the cell aggregates formed in these experiments could be disrupted by the addition of EGTA to deplete Ca2+ from the culture medium, providing additional evidence that the formation of aggregates was mediated by the expressed E-cadherin (data not shown). Whereas the above data assessed cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion as a long term steady-state condition, we also felt it was important to examine the effect of G12 proteins on aggregation as a short term dynamic process (42Brackenbury R. Thiery J.P. Rutishauser U. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Brackenbury R. Rutishauser U. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The chosen approach utilized an adherent cell line denoted MDA-MB-435 (435 cells), which lacks endogenous E-cadherin (see “Experimental Procedures”). These cells were stably transfected with cDNAs for either mouse E-cadherin to produce 435-E-cad cells or an empty plasmid to produce 435-puro cells, and clonal cell lines were established. A recombinant adenovirus expressing Gα12QL along with a GFP marker was employed to introduce the activated Gα protein into the two-cell populations, whereas adenovirus expressing only GFP was used as a control. To assess short term aggregation, single cell suspensions were prepared by trypsinizing the cells in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2, which preserves functional E-cadherin at the cell surface, and the cells were allowed to re-aggregate for 1 h in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. Under these conditions, 435-E-cad cells infected with control adenovirus rapidly formed large aggregates (Fig.3 a). However, the expression of Gα12QL in the 435-E-cad cells markedly hindered the formation of the large cell aggregates. Instead, these cells formed distinctly smaller aggregates that were much greater in number (Fig. 3 a). Furthermore, 435-puro cells infected with either control adenovirus or control containing Gα12QL did not form aggregates. To directly assess the importance of interaction between E-cadherin and G12 proteins in the observed Gα12-mediated inhibition of cadherin-dependent aggregation, we took advantage of a previous study (14Kaplan D.D. Meigs T.E. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44037-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that mapped the G12-interacting region of human E-cadherin to a highly charged 11-residue domain near the C terminus. MDA-MB-435 cells were engineered to stably express a mouse E-cadherin cDNA lacking this 11-residue region (denoted 435-ΔG12 cells), and a clonal line of these cells with E-cadherin levels similar to the levels in 435-E-cad cells (Fig. 3 d) was chosen for the study. When subjected to the fast aggregation assay described above, 435-ΔG12 cells formed large aggregates (Fig. 3 a) that were indistinguishable from 435-E-cad cells (i.e. those expressing full-length E-cadherin). However, the expression of Gα12QL in the 435-ΔG12 cells did not change the appearance or size of these aggregates (Fig. 3 a), which contrasted sharply with the results observed in 435-E-cad cells. The quantitation of the approximate size of these cell aggregates also revealed a sharp Gα12QL-induced decrease in aggregate size in 435-E-cad cells but not a significant decrease in 435-ΔG12 cells (Fig. 3 b). These findings suggest that the binding of activated Gα12 directly to cadherin is required for the disruption of cell-cell adhesion. The addition of EGTA instead of Ca2+ during the aggregation assay caused complete dissociation of 435-E-cad cells (Fig. 3 c) and 435-ΔG12 cells (data not shown), providing additional evidence that cell aggregation was mediated through E-cadherin. Furthermore, an immunoblot analysis confirmed that Gα12 was expressed at similar levels in all cells infected with the Gα12QL adenovirus and also showed that neither Gα12QL expression nor adenovirus infection significantly altered E-cadherin levels (Fig. 3 d). Taken together with the data presented in Fig. 2, these findings provide compelling evidence that the G12 subfamily indeed down-regulates E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. An important property of cadherins is the maintenance of tissue integrity; this property is pertinent not only to normal solid tissues but also to neoplastic tissues (2Potter E. Bergwitz C. Brabant G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 207-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 49Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Wound-filling assays have been commonly used to assess the ability of cadherins to modulate cell migratory and invasive phenotypes (50Chen W.C. Obrink B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 51Chen H. Paradies N.E. Fedor-Chaiken M. Brackenbury R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether G12 proteins could influence this property of cadherins as well, we utilized 435-E-cad cells and 435-puro cells in wound-filling assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). When a monolayer of cells was wounded by scraping, cells lacking E-cadherin (435-puro cells) frequently broke free from the advancing “wall” of cells and migrated into the wound area as lone cells (Fig.4). For the purposes of this assay, we designated such cells as “free-migrating cells.” Conversely, cells expressing E-cadherin (435-E-cad cells) advanced slowly into the wound area as a cohesive wall of c"

Supernatant media of shear stress-exposed endothelial cells (EC) contained significantly higher amounts of bFGF than medium from static cells. Released bFGF was fully intact with regard to its function as an inductor of proliferation and differentiation. Shear stress-conditioned media induced capillary-like structure formation, whereas static control medium did not. Likewise, only shear stress-conditioned medium induced proliferation of serum starved EC. Both capillary-like structure formation and proliferation could be inhibited by neutralization of bFGF or its receptor. The release of bFGF was subject to specific, integrin-mediated control, since inhibition of αvβ3 integrin prevented it, whereas inhibition of α5β1 integrin had no effect. We conclude that shear stress induces the release of bFGF from EC in a tightly controlled manner. The release is dependent on specific cell-matrix interactions via αvβ3integrins. The effects on cell proliferation and differentiation suggest that release of bFGF is functionally significant and may represent a necessary initial step in adaptive remodeling processes induced by shear stress.

It is believed that shear stress represents an important stimulus for these vascular events. However, little is known about the mechanism of mechano-sensing (the initial step) or about potential mediators involved in this shear stress response. Some growth factors controlling angiogenesis have similar vascular effects as shear stress. They are involved in a regulated time sequence of cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Therefore, growth factors might be sufficient to induce remodeling processesper se (3Breen E.C. Johnson E.C. Wagner H. Tseng H.M. Sung L.A. Wagner P.D. J. Appl.

The expression of bFGF is not affected at the transcription level by shear stress, hypoxia, or hypertension (14Sarzani R. Brecher P. Chobanian A.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), all of which have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis (3Breen E.C. Johnson E.C. Wagner H. Tseng H.M. Sung L.A. Wagner P.D.

Sports Exerc. 1999; 31: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but bFGF is stored at significant concentrations within the endothelium and could well be released in amounts sufficient to initiate angiogenesis after exposure to high shear stress. Therefore, we hypothesized that shear stress could serve as an adequate stimulus for the release of bFGF from endothelial cells and that bFGF could function as a mediator of shear stress-induced angiogenesis. Because many investigators are claiming that part of the mechano-sensing occurs via specific cell-matrix interactions of integrin and non-integrin receptors (15Gloe T. Riedmayr S. Sohn H.Y. Pohl U.

To verify these hypotheses, cultured primary porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) were exposed for up to 6 h to physiological levels of shear stress (16 dyn/cm2) with and without the addition of inhibitory peptides GRGDSP (mainly inhibiting αvβ3 integrins) and GRGDNP (mainly inhibiting α5β1 integrins) (20Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E.

We tested whether shear stress mediated the release of bFGF from endothelial cells and whether this release was controlled by matrix receptors. It was additionally studied whether released bFGF increased cellular responses known to be involved in angiogenesis, namely endothelial cell growth and differentiation. Shear stress experiments were performed using PAEC, which had been isolated as described before (15Gloe T. Riedmayr S. Sohn H.Y. Pohl U. J. Biol.

Briefly, fresh aortae were obtained from the slaughterhouse and kept in sterile phosphate-buffered saline until final preparation. The tissue specimens were trimmed and freed of fat and connective tissue, cut longitudinally, and stretched into a frame. A sterile solution of collagenase (0.2 units/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was applied to the luminal side of the aorta and kept there for 20 min at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere. Finally, the endothelial cells were washed off with culture medium and cultivated under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12). To bioassay bFGF, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used because of their higher sensitivity to exogenous growth factors. The central veins from fresh umbilical cords were flushed with sterile, warm, phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently filled with collagenase solution (0.2 units/ml). After an incubation of 20 min at 37 °C, the dislodged endothelial cells were flushed out and collected. They were seeded onto plastic culture dishes and cultivated in a moist atmosphere at 37 °C, 5% CO2, using 20% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 supplemented with 20% endothelial cell growth medium from PromoCell as the culture medium. PAEC of passage 1 were seeded onto glass plates that had been pre-coated with laminin I (Sigma/Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor). Confluent plates were transferred into a cone and plate shear apparatus as described previously (15Gloe T. Riedmayr S. Sohn H.Y. Pohl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15996-16002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A laminar shear stress of 16 dyn/cm2 was applied for 6 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, peptides inhibiting binding of endothelial cells to the underlying matrix were applied, all at a final concentration of 50 μm. RGD peptides were used to inhibit integrin αvβ3-mediated binding to vitronectin (GRGDSP, Invitrogen) and α5β1-mediated binding to fibronectin (GRGDNP, Invitrogen). In addition to inhibitory RGD peptides, the neutralizing antibodies LM609 (1 μg/ml; Calbiochem) against integrin αvβ3 and ReoPro (0.5 μg/ml; Lilly) against integrins gpIIa-IIIb and αvβ3 were applied during shear stress. As control, a nonspecific anti-goat immunoglobulin from rabbit (1 μg/ml; G4018, Sigma) was tested. At the end of the experiments conditioned media were collected and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. At the end of the 6-h application period of shear stress, the endothelial cells were further cultivated under static conditions for up to 24 h in fresh medium. Formation of capillary-like network structures was determined by microscopic inspection and was documented by photography. The amount of bFGF released from endothelial cells subjected to shear stress was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, strictly following the protocol provided by the manufacturer (R&D Systems). An aliquot of 100 μl of the respective supernatant was collected for this measurement. For each experiment measurements were done in triplicate. Two independent bioassays were used to test the integrity and functional activity of the released bFGF. HUVECs, passage 2–4 (referred to here as “detector cells”), from static cultures were seeded onto plastic culture dishes (3-cm diameter). The occurrence of functional bFGF in conditioned media from either shear stress-treated (6 h, 16 dyn/cm2) or corresponding static control PAEC (referred to here as “donor cells”) was monitored as the induction of proliferation of serum-starved (16–24 h, 1% fetal calf serum) detector cells. Proliferation of the detector cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay (24Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46885) Google Scholar). MTT was added to the growth medium at 0.5 mg/ml (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h. At the end of the experiments, the reduction of MTT to blue formazan was monitored in a photometer at an optical density of 550 nm including a correction for plastic (subtraction of 630 nm values from that at 550 nm). In some experiments, a peptide (APSGHYKG, Biomol) preventing the dimerization (activation) of the bFGF receptor was added at 1 μg/ml (25Yayon A. Aviezer D. Safran M. Gross J.L. Heldman Y. Cabilly S. Givol D. Katchalski-Katzir E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10643-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Its specificity in inhibiting only bFGF-induced proliferation was verified in a separate set of experiments. Recombinant bFGF was administered at 3 ng/ml alone or in combination with 0.5 ng/ml EGF (positive control stimulus) to HUVEC previously starved of serum. The subsequent proliferation was tested with the MTT assay. Additionally, conditioned media from the shear stress experiments were tested for their capacity to induce the formation of capillary-like structures in HUVEC, which had never been exposed to shear stress in culture. The detector cells were seeded onto glass beads (density 1.02 g/ml, mean diameter 70 μm; Sigma). After these cells reached confluency, they were embedded in a fibrin gel (5 mg/ml fibrinogen dissolved in conditioned media from either shear stress or static control experiments and solidified with 0.5 units/ml thrombin). After 72 h, capillary-like structures with a minimum length of 70 μm (the diameter of the glass beads serving as size marker) grown into the gel were counted. Similar to the proliferation assay, the specific role of bFGF was confirmed by incubations with inhibitory antibodies (1 μg/ml) against bFGF and VEGF (F3393 and V6627, respectively; Sigma). To verify that the release of bFGF from endothelial cells was not due to nonspecific cell membrane leakage, measurements of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were performed in the supernatant from static cells as well as from shear stress-treated cells in parallel experiments (n = 6). A commercial kit (Promega) was used for LDH determinations; the results are presented as direct readings at OD 485 nm (arbitrary units). For estimation of the sensitivity of the latter assay to detect cell damage, a defined number of HUVEC were serially diluted and lysed with 1% Triton X-100. Membrane integrity of the cells exposed to shear stress was tested by incubating PAEC with rhodamine-labeled dextran (molecular mass, 10,000 Da), which is membrane-impermeable, during shear stress experiments or, alternatively, with trypan blue, a dye that is actively excluded by the living cells, directly after finishing the shear stress experiment. After the shear stress experiments were finished, the cells were dislodged non-enzymatically from the glass plates using citrate-buffered saline and measured for uptake of rhodamine-labeled dextran with FACS analysis. The trypan blue staining of the cells was inspected qualitatively using an inverted microscope. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Western blotting for identification of bFGF was performed as follows. Cells that were either untreated or exposed to shear stress (16 dyn/cm2) for the indicated time intervals were dislodged non-enzymatically with EDTA (2 mm), KCl (135 mm), and sodium citrate (15 mm). Equal amounts of cell lysates (200 μg in 2% Triton, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) were incubated using a specific antibody against bFGF (F3393, Sigma), precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, and collected by centrifugation. The resulting pellets were solubilized with SDS-PAGE buffer and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using standard procedures. After electrophoresis the gels were transferred to nylon membrane using the semidry transfer technique. For detection of bFGF, the membranes were probed with an antibody specific for bFGF and visualized on an x-ray film using a second antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For documentation, the films were scanned with a video camera based system (Bio-Rad). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Shear stress experiments and their respective static controls were always performed in paired cultures from the same cell preparation lot. For each experiment a different, individual preparation lot was used. Student'st test for paired experiments was used to test for differences, which were considered significant at an error level ofp < 0.05. Statistical comparisons within groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance. The number of experiments performed is indicated as n. After exposure to 6 h of laminar shear stress (16 dyn/cm2), porcine aortic endothelial cells showed a profound alteration of their cellular shape and orientation. In contrast to the cobblestone morphology of the cells in static culture, these appeared to be elongated in the flow direction (as indicated by an arrow in Fig.1 A). When, after a 6-h initial shear stress exposure, these cells were cultivated for a further 24 h under renewed static culture conditions, they formed capillary-like structures as shown in Fig.1 B. Most of these structures were composed of multiple cells forming a two-dimensional network. As indicated by arrows, oblong unions were detectable, showing cellular migration and differentiation into hollow fibers, so-called capillary-like structures. The formation of these structures was completely inhibited by neutralization of the bFGF receptor (data not shown). Static control cells did not develop capillary-like features (Fig. 1 B). In time course experiments, elevated levels of bFGF were detectable in the supernatant after only 30 min of shear stress, increasing continuously during prolonged exposure to shear stress (see Fig.2 A). To determine the origin of the bFGF released by shear stress, Western blots were performed with lysates from cells either exposed to shear stress or kept under static control conditions. A citrate buffer was used instead of trypsin to dislodge the cells, thus preventing enzymatic liberation of bFGF from the matrix pool. Fig. 2 B shows that the cellular bFGF content was clearly diminished after shear stress, indicating that the bFGF was liberated from the cytoplasm and not from matrix. To rule out the possibility that bFGF accumulation in the supernatant medium from cells under shear stress was due to nonspecific cell damage, the release of LDH was measured. The LDH activities of the respective supernatants showed no significant differences (see Fig.3 A). Using a calibration curve with lysates of known cell numbers, the threshold for the LDH assay was determined to be less than 250 cells/assay (data not shown). Nevertheless, additional dye exclusion experiments were performed using rhodamine-labeled dextran (10,000 Da). Again, no evidence for cell damage was found by comparative FACS analysis between cells exposed to shear stress and static control cells (see Fig. 3 B). Proliferation assays were done to test the biological activity of the released bFGF. The conditioned medium from static PAEC (Fig.4 A, filled circles) did not induce proliferation in growth-arrested HUVEC, whereas exposure to shear stress-conditioned medium (Fig. 4 A, filled squares) resulted in a growth response similar to that induced by supplementation of the medium with 20% fetal calf serum (Fig.4 A, filled triangles). To verify that the growth response was due to bFGF, 1 μg/ml of a peptide (APSGHYKG) that inhibits dimerization and activation of the bFGF receptors was added in a subset of experiments (see Fig. 4 B). The inhibition of the bFGF receptor completely abolished 48-h cell proliferation induced by conditioned medium from shear stress experiments. The specificity of the bFGF-receptor blockade was tested in separate proliferation assays in which serum-starved HUVEC were exposed to either 1 ng/ml bFGF alone or in combination with 0.1 ng/ml EGF, which served here as a positive control. Administration of the peptide APSGHYKG or the bFGF-neutralizing antibody (F3393) inhibited only the bFGF-induced proliferation but not the remaining cell proliferation induced by EGF (data not shown). In addition to proliferation, shear stress-conditioned medium induced the formation of capillary-like structures (see Fig.5, A and B), whereas no differentiation was detectable with supernatants from static control cells. In a subset of experiments, neutralizing antibodies for bFGF (F3393) as well as VEGF (V6627) were added to the conditioned media either from static cultured or from shear stress-treated PAEC. Similar to the effects of the proliferation assays, inhibition of bFGF abolished the induction of capillary-like structure formation by shear stress-conditioned medium, whereas the neutralizing antibody to VEGF had no inhibitory effects (see Fig. 5 C). It is thought that endothelial cells sense mechanical loads via certain cell-matrix interactions. We therefore investigated a possible role in cell-matrix interactions by integrins of the β3 and β1 integrin family. The antagonists used were the peptides GRGDSP, predominantly inhibiting matrix binding via αvβ3, and GRGDNP, mainly inhibiting α5β1 binding. No significant differences in the release of bFGF were found in the conditioned media of shear stress-treated PAEC during incubation with the peptide GRGDNP (50 μm). In contrast, when cells were incubated with medium containing the GRGDSP peptide (50 μm), the release of bFGF into the medium during shear stress was abolished. This finding was further confirmed by experiments using the antibodies LM609 and ReoPro for inhibition of αvβ3. The antibody blockade of αvβ3 with both LM609 (1 μg/ml) and ReoPro (0.5 μg/ml) reduced bFGF release significantly, whereas the nonspecific control antibody to goat IgG (G4018) had no effect (see Fig. 6). None of the different protocols of peptide or antibody application enhanced cell detachment during shear stress. This study demonstrates that shear stress is a potent stimulus for the release of bFGF, which is not due to release from mechanically damaged cells but rather is a well controlled phenomenon that involves specific integrin-matrix interactions. The release of bFGF occurs in sufficient amounts to induce endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation. In the past, speculations about the release mechanism arose because the bFGF protein sequence does not carry a signal peptide, which would be necessary for penetration of the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and thus for secretion in the “classical” way. Although a growing number of proteins lacking a signal sequence are already known, to date no common pathway of secretion has been identified. Several groups have investigated the enzymatic liberation of bFGF from the extracellular matrix by proteolytic and nonproteolytic activities (8Joseph-Silverstein J. Rifkin D.B. Semin. Thromb.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 2, however, clearly demonstrate that the origin of the bFGF released by shear stress is the cytoplasm. Investigating the cellular bFGF content we found that the endothelial cells lost their immunoreactivity for bFGF after shear stress periods as short as 2 h and did not regain appreciable amounts thereafter. This might be explained by the fact that the constitutive bFGF expression is not up-regulated by shear stress. Accordingly, bFGF is not re-synthesized in a manner appropriate to overcome the cellular loss ensuing from enhanced release. By searching the literature, a list of possible triggers for this liberation of bFGF can be found. However, most of them do not occur physiologically and, therefore, might be only artificial. Such “nonphysiological” stimuli are UV light treatment (34Gilchrest B.A. Park H.Y. Eller M.S. Yaar M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), physico-mechanical treatments (like freeze-thawing, sonication, scrape-loading, or balloon catheter de-endothelialization) (10Villaschi S.

In vivo, one common and accepted hypothesis proposes that so called “sublethal” membrane disruptions may be responsible for the cellular bFGF release, which led to the idea that bFGF represents a kind of “wound hormone” (37Muthukrishnan L. Warder E. McNeil P.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148 (suppl.): 1-16Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In accordance with the preceding hypothesis, one might argue that during the shear stress experiments, mechanically induced nonlethal cell damage could have occurred, allowing bFGF to be liberated from the cytosol into the supernatant medium. However, we did not find a significant elevation of LDH in shear stress-conditioned media, which rules out damage of a significant number of cells; our detection limit for this method was calculated to be less than 250 cells. Additionally, rhodamine-labeled dextran (with a molecular mass of 10,000 Da) applied during shear stress was used to further assess the integrity of the cellular membrane. Because intact membranes are impermeable for dextran, it will only enter the cells with nonspecific membrane leaks. Again, we could not find an elevated level of rhodamine fluorescence in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress. Shear stress as well as other pathophysiological stimuli,e.g. elevated hydrostatic pressure (45Acevedo A.D. Bowser S.S. Gerritsen M.E. Bizios R. J. Cell.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), are all accompanied by enhanced liberation of bFGF from living cells but do not necessarily disrupt the membrane. Our data rather favor the hypothesis of a tightly regulated physiological pathway of bFGF release. This concept is further strengthened by the fact that in our study the release of bFGF could be inhibited by the application of certain RGD peptides. It is quite likely that this integrin dependence reflects a critical involvement of the cytoskeleton and/or focal adhesion points in the generation and propagation of the signal within the cell, leading to enhanced liberation of bFGF. This theory is supported by a recent publication of Albuquerque et al. (59Albuquerque M.L. Akiyama S.K. Schnaper H.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), who showed that estrogen-stimulated endothelial cells release significantly more bFGF when cells are seeded on the extracellular matrix proteins laminin I, collagen IV, and fibronectin compared with collagen I or pure plastic. It has to be emphasized, however, that only inhibition of αvβ3 but not of α5β1 integrins reduced the release of bFGF in our experiments. The latter argues against a general role for cell-matrix interactions in mediating the release of bFGF; rather, it indicates a specific signaling pathway. Although the signaling cascade remains unclear at present, it proffers the important possibility of selectively altering the sensitivity of bFGF release toward shear stress by altering the expression of αvβ3 integrins or the corresponding matrix binding sites, respectively. Interestingly, Rusnati et al.(57Rusnati M. Tanghetti E. Dell'Era P. Gualandris A. Presta M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) reported recently that bFGF might serve as a substrate for αvβ3 integrin adhesion, and thereby it could be an important mediator in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. In sum this would mean that shear stress is able to induce bFGF release only under certain conditions, and it might be speculated that such conditions pertain to tissues exhibiting angiogenesis during chronically elevated shear stress. This process goes along with an elevation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression, which is mediated by the non-integrin matrix-receptor for laminin, the 67-kDa laminin-binding protein, as we have reported before (15Gloe T. Riedmayr S. Sohn H.Y. Pohl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15996-16002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The peptide YIGSR, however, which neutralizes the laminin-binding protein (23Bushkin-Harav I. Garty N.B. Littauer U.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13422-13428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), had no significant effects on the liberation of bFGF (data not shown), which suggests that different matrix-binding proteins may represent highly precise hinges for shear dependent signaling pathways. Taking into consideration that bFGF is described as a potent inducer of gene expression of other angiogenic growth factors and their receptors,e.g. VEGF and Flk-1 (58Pepper M.S. Mandriota S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it can be hypothesized that bFGF might function as a physiological “first and acute response” for endothelial cells to mechanical loads such as shear stress. This first response may later lead to the induction of VEGF-mediated steps. In this early stage of shear-dependent effects, however, we did not find a significant role for VEGF."

Thus, one of the earliest biochemical events seen in T lymphocytes triggered through the TCR complex is the enhanced phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins on tyrosine residues (7Hsi E.D.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The low molecular weight PTPase (LMPTP) is a unique enzyme with limited sequence homology to the other PTPases (26Ramponi G. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1994; 8: 1-25Google Scholar, 27Wo Y.-Y.P. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Davis J.P. Mitchell G.L. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10856-10865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LMPTP (also known as ACP1) was originally classified as an ubiquitously expressed acid phosphatase (28Dissing J. Biochem. Genet. 1987; 25: 901-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but was later found to be highly specific for phosphotyrosine (29Ramponi G. Manao G. Camici G. Cappugi G. Ruggiero M. Bottaro D.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Its crystal structure (30Su X.-D. Taddei N. Massimo S. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) confirmed that LMPTP uses a cysteine-based catalytic mechanism similar to other PTPases. The physiological function of LMPTP is unknown. A high level overexpression of LMPTP in cells transformed by PTK oncogenes leads to decreased proliferation and ability to form colonies in soft agar (26Ramponi G. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1994; 8: 1-25Google Scholar, 31Ramponi G. Ruggiero M. Raugei G. Berti A. Modesti A. Degl'Innocenti D. Magnelli L. Pazzagli C. Chiarugi V.P. Camici G. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that LMPTP can interact directly with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (32Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and other receptor PTKs. We have recently reported that LMPTP is expressed in T cells and is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine (33Tailor P. Williams S. Gilman J. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). LMPTP also differed from 13 other tested T cell-expressed PTPases in that it augmented TCR-induced reporter gene activation (34Gjörloff-Wingren A., Oh, P. Saxena M. Han S. Wang X. Williams S. Schnitzer J. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Here we report that LMPTP, like CD45, plays a positive role in TCR signaling by preferentially dephosphorylating a negative regulatory site, namely Tyr-292 of ZAP-70. This leads to a severalfold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase at its positive regulatory sites and enhanced kinase activity. In contrast, LMPTP did not affect the Src family PTKs Lck or Fyn or the phosphorylation of the TCR-ζ or Itk/Emt by these kinases. Based on our results we suggest that LMPTP plays a positive role in TCR signaling by counteracting the negative regulation of ZAP-70.DISCUSSIONWe were initially puzzled by the finding that LMPTP, a phosphatase, caused increased phosphorylation of ZAP-70. However, the effect was observed repeatedly, and we decided to consider three different possibilities: (i) LMPTP may dephosphorylate and activate Lck to increase its phosphorylation of ZAP-70; (ii) another PTPase (e.g. SHP-1) is functionally inactivated by LMPTP-mediated dephosphorylation and subsequently reduces its dephosphorylation of ZAP-70; (iii) LMPTP may dephosphorylate a negative regulatory site on ZAP-70 leading to an allosteric activating effect or a reduced association with a negative regulator, such as c-Cbl (46Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or another PTPase. Our data are consistent with the third model, although more complex or additional effects are difficult to exclude.Our experimental results do not support the possibility that LMPTP augments ZAP-70 phosphorylation by activating Src family PTKs. First, we have been unable to detect any effects of LMPTP on Lck or Fyn. Second, LMPTP augmented the TCR-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in JCaM1 cells co-expressing the Y505F-mutated Lck, which cannot be activated through dephosphorylation of Tyr-505. Third, the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-ζ was unaltered in ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates. Fourth, Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk/Emt in co-transfected COS cells was not augmented by LMPTP, but was counteracted by LMPTP. Fifth, although LMPTP was able to cause some dephosphorylation of Lck in vitro, the dephosphorylation was slow and showed no preference for Tyr-505 over Tyr-394 (not shown).The possibility that LMPTP reduces the action of another PTPase is more difficult to exclude. Only two PTPases have been suggested to dephosphorylate ZAP-70, namely SHP-1 (47Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel T.J. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 48Brockdorff J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2539-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and PEP (49Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Of these two, only SHP-1 is known to be tyrosine phosphorylated (50Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but this phosphorylation does not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. We recently reported (48Brockdorff J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2539-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that SHP-1 can indeed dephosphorylate ZAP-70, but that this required activation of SHP-1 by removal of the SH2 domains. Deletion of the C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites in SHP-1 had no effect. Thus, a potential dephosphorylation of SHP-1 by LMPTP would not suffice as a mechanism for the effect of LMPTP that we report.The model we favor is that LMPTP directly dephosphorylates ZAP-70 at Tyr-292. As mutation of Tyr-292 causes a significant increase (45Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in the total tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (despite the lack of one tyrosine), we propose that the removal of phosphate from Tyr-292 by LMPTP results in an increase of ZAP-70 phosphorylation at other sites (including Tyr-493) to an extent that exceeds the loss of phosphate at Tyr-292. This notion is supported by the lack of effects of LMPTP on Y292F-mutated ZAP-70 (Fig. 4).The physiological relevance of LMPTP-mediated Tyr-292 dephosphorylation is difficult to address conclusively. The absence of phosphate at this site in resting T cells clearly indicates that a cellular PTPase with this specificity must exist in resting T cells. In our hands, none of the nearly 20 different PTPases we have tested (11Gjörloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Williams S. Hammi D. Mustelin T. Eur. J.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 1934-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) has a positive effect on TCR signaling, except LMPTP and CD45. A physiological relevance is also suggested by the low level of LMPTP required for optimal stimulation of ZAP-70 and the membrane-proximal subcellular location of LMPTP. Finally, the opposite effect of the catalytically inactive LMPTP-C12S may be the result of a “dominant-negative” competition with endogenous LMPTP.Based on our findings, we propose that LMPTP, like CD45, has a positive role in TCR signaling. By dephosphorylating Tyr-292 of ZAP-70, LMPTP counteracts the negative regulation of this kinase through the action of c-Cbl or c-Cbl-associated molecules. Since LMPTP itself can be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells, it is likely that this role of LMPTP is modulated during T cell activation. Thus, LMPTP may be an important regulator of the threshold and duration of signaling through ZAP-70. The molecular mechanisms of signal transduction and T cell activation have been intensely studied during the past few years. It has become evident that several protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)1 and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) play crucial roles (1Weiss A. Littman D.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in the total tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (despite the lack of one tyrosine), we propose that the removal of phosphate from Tyr-292 by LMPTP results in an increase of ZAP-70 phosphorylation at other sites (including Tyr-493) to an extent that exceeds the loss of phosphate at Tyr-292. This notion is supported by the lack of effects of LMPTP on Y292F-mutated ZAP-70 (Fig. 4).The physiological relevance of LMPTP-mediated Tyr-292 dephosphorylation is difficult to address conclusively. The absence of phosphate at this site in resting T cells clearly indicates that a cellular PTPase with this specificity must exist in resting T cells. In our hands, none of the nearly 20 different PTPases we have tested (11Gjörloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Williams S. Hammi D. Mustelin T. Eur. J.

A physiological relevance is also suggested by the low level of LMPTP required for optimal stimulation of ZAP-70 and the membrane-proximal subcellular location of LMPTP. Finally, the opposite effect of the catalytically inactive LMPTP-C12S may be the result of a “dominant-negative” competition with endogenous LMPTP.Based on our findings, we propose that LMPTP, like CD45, has a positive role in TCR signaling. By dephosphorylating Tyr-292 of ZAP-70, LMPTP counteracts the negative regulation of this kinase through the action of c-Cbl or c-Cbl-associated molecules. Since LMPTP itself can be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells, it is likely that this role of LMPTP is modulated during T cell activation. Thus, LMPTP may be an important regulator of the threshold and duration of signaling through ZAP-70. We were initially puzzled by the finding that LMPTP, a phosphatase, caused increased phosphorylation of ZAP-70. However, the effect was observed repeatedly, and we decided to consider three different possibilities: (i) LMPTP may dephosphorylate and activate Lck to increase its phosphorylation of ZAP-70; (ii) another PTPase (e.g. SHP-1) is functionally inactivated by LMPTP-mediated dephosphorylation and subsequently reduces its dephosphorylation of ZAP-70; (iii) LMPTP may dephosphorylate a negative regulatory site on ZAP-70 leading to an allosteric activating effect or a reduced association with a negative regulator, such as c-Cbl (46Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or another PTPase. Our data are consistent with the third model, although more complex or additional effects are difficult to exclude. Our experimental results do not support the possibility that LMPTP augments ZAP-70 phosphorylation by activating Src family PTKs. First, we have been unable to detect any effects of LMPTP on Lck or Fyn. Second, LMPTP augmented the TCR-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in JCaM1 cells co-expressing the Y505F-mutated Lck, which cannot be activated through dephosphorylation of Tyr-505. Third, the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-ζ was unaltered in ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates. Fourth, Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk/Emt in co-transfected COS cells was not augmented by LMPTP, but was counteracted by LMPTP. Fifth, although LMPTP was able to cause some dephosphorylation of Lck in vitro, the dephosphorylation was slow and showed no preference for Tyr-505 over Tyr-394 (not shown). The possibility that LMPTP reduces the action of another PTPase is more difficult to exclude. Only two PTPases have been suggested to dephosphorylate ZAP-70, namely SHP-1 (47Plas D.R. Johnson R.

Of these two, only SHP-1 is known to be tyrosine phosphorylated (50Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but this phosphorylation does not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. We recently reported (48Brockdorff J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2539-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that SHP-1 can indeed dephosphorylate ZAP-70, but that this required activation of SHP-1 by removal of the SH2 domains. Deletion of the C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites in SHP-1 had no effect. Thus, a potential dephosphorylation of SHP-1 by LMPTP would not suffice as a mechanism for the effect of LMPTP that we report. The model we favor is that LMPTP directly dephosphorylates ZAP-70 at Tyr-292. As mutation of Tyr-292 causes a significant increase (45Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1967835314,"The B cell receptor (BCR) initiates three major signaling pathways: the Ras pathway, which leads to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation; the phospholipase C-γ pathway, which causes calcium mobilization; and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway. These combine to induce different biological responses depending on the context of the BCR signal. Both the Ras and PI 3-kinase pathways are important for B cell development and activation. Several model systems show evidence of cross-regulation between these pathways. Here we demonstrate through the use of PI 3-kinase inhibitors and a dominant-negative PI 3-kinase construct that the BCR-induced phosphorylation and activation of ERK is dependent on PI 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase feeds into the Ras signaling cascade at multiple points, both upstream and downstream of Ras. We also show that ERK activation is dependent on phospholipase C-γ, in keeping with its dependence on calcium mobilization. Last, the activation of PI 3-kinase itself is completely dependent on Ras. We conclude that the PI 3-kinase and Ras signaling cascades are intimately connected in B cells and that the activation of ERK is a signal integration point, since it requires simultaneous input from all three major signaling pathways."

If the spinning object is itself chiral, its shape modifies the characteristics of the vortex; interactions between that vortex and other vortices then depend on the chirality of the objects that produce them. This paper describes the aggregation of millimeter-sized, chiral magnetized plates floating at a liquid-air interface and rotating under the influence of a rotating external magnetic field. This external field confines all the plates at densities that cause the vortices they generate to interact strongly. For one set of plates investigated, plates of one chirality attract one another, and plates of the other chirality repel other plates of both chiralities."

The molecular pathway by which MPs interact with viral genomes and target plasmodesmata channels is largely unknown. The 9-kDa MP from carnation mottle carmovirus (CarMV) contains two potential transmembrane domains. To explore the possibility that this protein is in fact an intrinsic membrane protein, we have investigated its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. By using in vitro translation in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, we demonstrate that CarMV p9 inserts into the endoplasmic reticulum without the aid of any additional viral or plant host components. We further show that the membrane topology of CarMV p9 is Ncyt-Ccyt (N and C termini of the protein facing the cytoplasm) by in vitro translation of a series of truncated and full-length constructs with engineered glycosylation sites. Based on these results, we propose a topological model in which CarMV p9 is anchored in the membrane with its N- and C-terminal tail segments interacting with its soluble, RNA-bound partner CarMV p7, to accomplish the viral cell-to-cell movement function.

To fulfill these roles, RNA almost invariably functions in association with proteins. This is true also for RNA transport, where proteins stabilize, protect, and target RNA for passage through the nucleocytoplasmic pores or for intercellular trafficking. However, the functional and structural analysis of the diverse families of RNA-binding proteins is still far from completed. One of these families of proteins whose mechanism of action has not been fully characterized is the movement protein (MP)1 family found in plant viruses. The process of infection by plant viruses depends on the cell-to-cell traffic of viruses within a plant host. This process is mediated by MPs and is assumed to take place through the plasmodesmata. These are membranous channels that connect higher plant cells into a functional intercellular communication network. Many proteins, including several plant virus MPs (1Pickard B.G. Beachy R.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), have been reported to be associated with these specialized channels and to facilitate passage of a variety of macromolecules into and between cells and cellular compartments. Consequently, viral infection spreads throughout the whole host plant (reviewed in Refs. 2Carrington J.C. Kasschau K.D. Mahajan S.K. Schaad M.C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1669-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 3Ghoshroy S. Lartey R. Sheng J. Citovsky V. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The spread of infection is aided by interactions between pathogen and host components (5Reichel C. Mas P. Beachy R.N. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 458-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several MPs have been demonstrated to increase plasmodesmatal size exclusion limits to allow the movement of virus-nucleic acid complexes into adjacent cells (6Oparka K.J. Prior D.A. Santa Cruz S. Padgett H.S. Beachy R.N. Plant J. 1997; 12: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Oparka K.J. Roberts A.G. Boevink P. Santa Cruz S. Roberts I. Pradel K.S. Imlau A. Kotlizky G. Sauer N. Epel B. Cell. 1999; 97: 743-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although MPs are required for this dramatic and temporary increase in intercellular permeability, the responsible mechanism is so far unclear. However, because of the intrinsic membranous composition of the plasmodesmata, it can be assumed that many of the associated proteins could be membrane proteins. Thus, the MP of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a member of the so-called 30-kDa superfamily of virus MPs (8Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Ryabov E.V. Dolja V.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Melcher U. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), contains an integral membrane protein-like domain and a cytosolically exposed RNA-binding domain (10Brill L.M. Nunn R.S. Kahn T.W. Yeager M. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7112-7117Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). There is also experimental evidence that supports a predominant role of membrane protein-like domains in other MPs (11Grieco F. Castellano M.A., Di Sansebastiano G.P. Maggipinto G. Neuhaus J.M. Martelli G.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Solovyev A.G. Stroganova T.A. Zamyatnin A.A., Jr. Fedorkin O.N. Schiemann J. Morozov S.Y. Virology. 2000; 269: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Ward B.M. Medville R. Lazarowitz S.G. Turgeon R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3726-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that many plant viruses replicate in association with the ER membrane, and in some cases it has been postulated that membrane-integrated MPs would allow the formation of the membrane-associated replication complexes (14Heinlein M. Padgett H.S. Gens J.S. Pickard B.G. Casper S.J. Epel B.L. Beachy R.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1107-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Mas P. Beachy R.N. J.

MPs would thus contribute to the intracellular distribution of the virus and to the above-mentioned manipulation of plasmodesmal pores to facilitate cell-to-cell spread of infection. Studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis of multi-domain proteins often are confounded by the sheer complexity of such proteins. Our goal is to uncover the dual functions of MPs (RNA binding and membrane interaction) through functional and structural analysis of MPs found in viruses containing multiple single-domain MPs. Carmoviruses are among the smallest known plant viruses whose MPs do not belong to the multi-domain 30-kDa superfamily. Their genome is a positive sense single-stranded RNA of ∼4 kb encoding at least five proteins (17Qu F. Morris T.J. Granoff A. Webster R.G. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 243-247Crossref Google Scholar, 18Russo M. Burgyan J. Martelli G.P. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 381-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The type member of the group, carnation mottle carmovirus (CarMV), has in the central region of the genome two small overlapping open reading frames that code for two small MPs, p7 and p9. It has been demonstrated in the closely related turnip crinkle carmovirus that disruption of the homologous genes blocks the cell-to-cell movement function of the virus (19Hacker D.L. Petty I.T. Wei N. Morris T.J. Virology. 1992; 186: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized CarMV p7 as a soluble protein with RNA binding capacity (20Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Perez-Paya E. Pallas V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and have structurally characterized, by means of a retrostructural approach, three different protein domains of p7, including the RNA-binding domain (21Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, comparing the MPs of Carmoviruses with those of the 30-kDa superfamily (taking as representative TMV MP), p7 should be considered as the equivalent to the cytosolically exposed RNA-binding domain of TMV MP. Therefore, CarMV p9 is a strong candidate for the membrane-embedded domain found in TMV MP. In the present study, we show that CarMV p9 is an integral membrane protein. Sequence analysis of p9 and homologues from related plant viruses shows two consensus hydrophobic regions, suggesting the presence of two membrane-spanning domains. Peptides corresponding to the two putative transmembrane segments of CarMV p9 have been analyzed by CD spectroscopy, and the membrane inserting activity of the hydrophobic domains has been evaluated by in vitrotranscription/translation experiments using ER-derived dog pancreas microsomes. In addition, we have used a glycosylation mapping technique to determine the topology of CarMV p9 in the ER membrane. A model is proposed where the RNA is targeted to the membrane through an interaction between p7 and p9. Such a protein complex would facilitate the cell-to-cell viral transport through the plasmodesmata channels. Unless otherwise stated, all of the enzymes as well as plasmid pGEM1, RiboMAX SP6 RNA polymerase system, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were from Promega (Madison, WI) or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [35S]Met and14C-methylated marker proteins were from AmershamBioSciences. The PCR purification and RNeasy RNA clean up kits were from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The PCR mutagenesis kit QuikChange was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides were from the Kebo Laboratory (Stockholm, Sweden), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Isogen (Maarssen, The Netherlands). Peptides p93–24 and p936–57 were manually synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (39Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Prot. Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar), and peptide p956–84 was synthesized as a C-terminal carboxamide on a 0.10 mm scale using an Applied Biosystems model 433A solid phase peptide synthesizer. Analytical reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to determine the purity and identity of the peptides. All of the measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter in conjunction with a Neslab RTE 110 water bath and temperature controller as in Ref.21Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. The secondary structure content was analyzed with the software provided with the spectropolarimeter, which uses as a reference the CD spectra of model proteins (40Yang J.T., Wu, C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). p9 was cloned into pQE-9K from viral RNA of infected Chenopodium quinoa plants by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (23Cañizares M.C. Marcos J.F. Pallás V. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 2039-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding Lep pGEM-Lep-NST and pGEM-Lep-QST were previously generated (41Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Introduction of the hydrophobic fragments from the p9 protein into the Lep sequence was carried out by replacing the H2 segment of Lep by PCR amplification of pQE-9K with forward primers containing appropriate restriction sites. For the LepTM1 construct, residues 59–81 in H2 (see Fig. 2, top panel) were replaced by residues 1–29 of p9; for LepTM2, again H2 was replaced by residues 30–59 of p9; and for LepTM1TM2, H2 was also replaced by residues 1–59 of p9. After PCR amplification, the PCR products were purified, digested, and ligated to the corresponding Lep vectors digested with the same enzymes. All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cloning into pGEM1 was done using full-length p9NcoI-NdeI fragments from pQE-9K. To obtain full-length constructs, transcription of p9 gene was done after PCR using a reverse primer carrying an stop codon at the end of p9 sequence. Construct p9TM1/P2 was obtained by PCR deletion of TM2 and the C terminus of p9. In constructs LepTM1TM2 and full-length p9, the nucleotide sequence coding for Ala44-Leu45-Ser46 (numbering corresponding to the p9 wild type sequence) roughly located in the middle of the second TM fragment was changed to the sequence coding for Glu-Glu-Glu, with the aim of obtaining a nontransmembrane segment as a control for membrane insertion (see “Results”). In the full-length p9 constructs, the nucleotide sequence coding for the Asn-Tyr-Ser glycosylation acceptor site at position 65–67 in the wild type protein was changed to the nonacceptor Gln-Tyr-Ser, whereas an Asn-Ser-Ser was introduced at codons 69–71 replacing the wild type Asp-Ser-Ser sequence (p9WT* construct), roughly 14 amino acids downstream of putative second TM fragment. For mutagenesis, the QuikChange kit was used according to the manufacturer's protocol from Stratagene. DNA mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. In vitro transcription of Lep constructs was done as previously (24Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The mRNAs were purified using a Qiagen RNeasy clean up kit and verified on a 1% agarose gel. In vitro translation of the mRNA synthesized from thein vitro transcription was done in the presence of reticulocyte lysate and [35S]Met. The Lep constructs were processed as described previously (24Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For p9 constructs, after completion of the translation, the samples were alkaline extracted (see below) and electrophoresed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the assay was repeated in the presence either of a glycosylation acceptor tripeptide Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 as described (43Popov M. Tam L.Y., Li, J. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or of a nonacceptor tripeptide Ac-Gln-Tyr-Thr-NH2 (33 μm in both cases). For endoglycosidase H treatment, the translation mix was diluted (1:3) with 70 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.6) and ultracentrifugated (100,000 × g for 20 min) onto a sucrose cushion; pellet was redissolved in 40 μl of the same buffer with 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min; and the aliquots were then incubated at different times with 0.1 milliunits of endoglycosidase H at 37 °C as described (30Braun P. von Heijne G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9778-9782Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The alkaline flotation assays were performed as described (44Whitley P. Grahn E. Kutay U. Rapoport T. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7583-7586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the alkaline extraction experiments, 10 μl of the in vitro translation mixture was added to 90 μl of 100 mm Na2CO3(pH 12.5) and incubated on ice for 20 min. This mixture was layered onto a 50-μl sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 10 min (Beckman TL 100 centrifuge). The pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min while shaking prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. The supernatant was carefully removed, acid-precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 10%, and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation in a Microfuge, washed with acetone, dried, and similar to above resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All of the gels were dried at 80 °C and scanned using a Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImager using the MacBAS 2.31 software. Sequence comparisons of p9 from CarMV and related plant viral homologues (Fig.1 A) show two consensus hydrophobic regions linked by a polar loop, suggesting the presence of two membrane-spanning (TM) domains and a third highly charged region at the C terminus of the protein. TM domain predictions generated by different algorithms also identify two segments with high TM propensity. As an example, Fig. 1 B shows the probability of each residue to be part of a TM fragment using the TMHMM 2.0 program (22Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8984) Google Scholar), a method that uses a hidden Markov model for predicting TM helices in protein sequences. The first putative TM fragment extends from Asn5 to Leu23. Residues Arg24–Ser32 define an extramembranous loop, whereas the second TM fragment extends from Leu33 to Ile55. The polar C-terminal domain (Ser56–Lys84) is predicted to form a water-soluble region. The loop connecting the two TM domains is rich in polar residues (Ser and Thr) and also contains Pro residues. It is noteworthy that in the more distantly related carmoviruses galinsoga mosaic virus and melon necrotic spot virus (23Cañizares M.C. Marcos J.F. Pallás V. Arch. Virol. 2001; 146: 2039-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), only one TM segment is predicted (Fig. 1 A), which is preceded by polar and Pro residues, suggesting that a putative membrane-anchoring function can be also fulfilled by just one membrane-spanning motif. The same pattern is observed for the four necroviruses sequenced to date (data not shown). To individually analyze the different p9 regions, we synthesized three different peptides. Two of them are derived from the putative TM fragment domains (i.e. p93–24 and p936–57), and the third one (p956–84) covers the C-terminal domain of the protein. CD analysis of these three peptides in the presence of the secondary structure-inducing solvent trifluoroethanol indicated that peptides p93–24 and p936–57 adopt an α-helical conformation, whereas p956–84 adopts a mixture of random coil and β-sheet conformation (data not shown). In the presence of the membrane-mimetic detergent SDS at micellar concentrations, both p93–24 and p936–57 populate an α-helical conformation (Fig.1 C), with a higher helical content for p93–24(60% α-helix, 11% β-sheet, 3% turn, and 26% random) than for p936–57 (45% α-helix, 19% β-sheet, 2% turn, and 34% random). As expected, the hydrophobic regions identified as putative TM fragments thus behave as hydrophobic α-helices when analyzed in detergent micelles. The β-sheet content in the p956–84 peptide that represents the hydrophilic C-terminal region increases with the SDS concentration from an estimated (see “Materials and Methods”) ≈60% β-sheet content in aqueous solution to ≈72% in the presence of 0.4 mm SDS (Fig.1 D). To examine the propensity of the two hydrophobic p9 segments to form TM helices in biological membranes, an in vitro translation/translocation system with or without added dog pancreas microsomes was used. The Escherichia coli inner membrane protein Lep was used as an insertion vehicle for the putative TM fragments. Lep is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by two TM segments (H1 and H2) that are connected by the P1 domain. The P2 domain forms the C-terminal half of the protein (Fig.2, top panel). Upon in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, Lep has been shown to insert into the microsomal membrane with both the N and C termini on the luminal side (24Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An engineered glycosylation site placed downstream of H2 is glycosylated efficiently upon correct insertion into the microsomal membrane, serving as a reporter to distinguish between a lumenal (glycosylated) and a cytoplasmic (unglycosylated) location. Glycosylation of the molecule results in an increase in molecular mass of about 2.5 kDa relative to the observed molecular mass of Lep expressed in the absence of microsomes. The efficiency of glycosylation of Lep under standard conditions is 80–90% (24Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The microsomal in vitrosystem closely mimics the conditions of in vivo membrane protein assembly into the ER membrane. To study the membrane insertion capacity of the predicted TM fragments, the H2 segment of Lep (Fig. 2, top panel) was replaced by the two hydrophobic p9 segments TM1 (residues 1–29, LepTM1) and TM2 (residues 30–59, LepTM2). A segment with membrane insertion capacity will result in glycosylation of the chimeras, whereas a segment that lacks membrane partitioning will render unglycosylated molecules. Translation of the LepTM1 and LepTM2 constructs in the presence of microsomes resulted in efficient glycosylation, unequivocally demonstrating a transmembrane disposition for both TM1 and TM2 (Fig. 2,bottom panel, A and B). Control constructs with a mutated, nonfunctional glycosylation site (QST in place of NST; see “Materials and Methods”) were not glycosylated (data not shown). When both TM fragments and the native interconnecting loop in CarMV p9 (residues 1–59) replaced the H2 segment of Lep (construct LepTM1TM2), the level of glycosylation dropped to 25% (Fig. 2, bottom panel, C), suggesting that the predominating topology of this construct is Nlum-Ccyt with a minor fraction of the molecules having TM2 translocated to the luminal side. A similar level of glycosylation was also observed in a construct where H1 of Lep was not present, i.e. when p9 was fused directly to the P2 domain of Lep (construct p9/P2; data not shown). The somewhat inefficient membrane-anchoring ability of the second TM fragment of p9 correlates well with a diminished tendency to populate the α-helical conformation in SDS when compared with the first TM fragment of p9 (Fig. 1 C). To verify that the glycosylated LepTM1TM2 molecules result from inefficient membrane anchoring of TM2, we made an additional construct where the hydrophobic residues Ala44-Leu45-Ser46 located roughly in the middle of TM2 were changed to Glu44-Glu45-Glu46(LepTM1TM2EEE) to totally prevent membrane insertion of this segment. As expected, LepTM1TM2EEE was fully glycosylated (Fig. 2, bottom panel, D). Once it was demonstrated that both putative TM fragments from p9 can insert into the ER-derived microsomal membrane using Lep as vehicle, we sought to study the partitioning into the membrane of the wild type p9 protein. Although MPs lack apparent ER signal sequences and previousin vitro translated TMV MPs did not associate with dog pancreas membranes (14Heinlein M. Padgett H.S. Gens J.S. Pickard B.G. Casper S.J. Epel B.L. Beachy R.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1107-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), transcription/translation products of CarMV p9 showed protein association with heterologous microsomal membranes when analyzed by a flotation assay (Fig. 3). CarMV p9 was quantitatively recovered in the alkali-extracted membrane pellet, whereas only background levels were found in samples assayed in the absence of microsomes, demonstrating proper assembly into the microsomal membrane. Taken together, these results (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) identify p9 as a bitopic α-helical integral membrane protein. The relative orientation of protein membrane-spanning segments is of crucial importance to achieve correct membrane assembly that will allow proper function. The membrane topology predictions derived from p9 are contradictory. We used four well known topology prediction methods. All of them are designed to identify potential TM α-helices and to predict the overall in-out orientation of the protein in the membrane. Although PHD 2.1 (27Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and TMHMM 2.0 (22Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8984) Google Scholar) predict p9 with its N and C termini in the cytoplasm, TOPPRED 2.0 (28Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) and HMMTOP 2.0 (29Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) predict the opposite orientation, i.e. with the N and C termini in the lumen. To investigate the actual topology of p9, we first address the targeting and membrane insertion capability of the first TM fragment (TM1) by constructing a fusion where the Lep P2 domain (with a glycosylation site) was fused downstream of TM1 (p9TM1/P2). The results shown in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate Ncyt-Clum orientation for this construct, in agreement with the PHD 2.1 and TMHMM 2.0 predictions. We next made glycosylation assays of full-length p9 followed by alkaline extraction to study the complete topology of CarMV p9 in the ER membrane. Although there is an endogenous glycosylation site at Asn65-Tyr66-Ser67 in p9 (Fig.1 A), we decided not to use this sequon as a topological marker, because the distance between TM2 and the target Asn65 may be too short to allow efficient glycosylation (24Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Asn65 was mutated to nonacceptor Gln, and a new glycosylation site was introduced at a more favorable position (Asn69-Ser70-Ser71; construct p9WT*). p9WT* was not glycosylated when translated in the presence of microsomes (Fig. 5 A,lane 2), in agreement with the expected Ncyt-Ccyt topology. To show that the Asn69-Ser70-Ser71 site can be glycosylated if translocated to the ER lumen, we also made a construct where TM2 carried the previously described Ala44-Leu45-Ser46/Glu44-Glu45-Glu46mutation (p9WT*EEE) that prevents membrane integration of TM2. Translation of this construct in the presence of microsomes resulted in an increase in the molecular mass (Fig. 5 A,lane 4) that could be blocked by inclusion of a glycosylation inhibitor (Fig. 5 A, lane 5) and by treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 5 B), a glycan-removing enzyme (30Braun P. von Heijne G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9778-9782Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The glycosylation level obtained for p9WT*EEE (∼60%; Fig. 5, A, lane 4, and B, lane 2) is consistent with the somewhat reduced level of glycosylation expected for a target Asn located only 15 residues upstream of the stop codon (31Nilsson I. Witt S. Kiefer H. Mingarro I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The efficient glycosylation of p9TM1/P2 and the lack of glycosylation of p9WT* unequivocally demonstrate that the orientation of CarMV p9 is Ncyt-Ccyt. The mechanism of cell-to-cell transport of plant viruses is unsolved. It has been suggested that MPs may participate in the establishment of membrane-associated replication complexes, affect the intracellular distribution of plant virus, and modify the properties of plasmodesmal pores to allow cell-to-cell spread of infection (4Aaziz R. Dinant S. Epel B. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 326-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,32Tzfira T. Rhee Y. Chen M.-H. Kunik T. Citovsky V. Annu. Rev.

Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11169-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The 30-kDa MP from TMV has been shown to be essential for cell-to-cell spread of the virus (35Deom C.M. Oliver M.J. Beachy R.N. Science. 1987; 237: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and a topological model for this protein with two putative α-helical TM domains and a cytosolically exposed C terminus has been proposed (10Brill L.M. Nunn R.S. Kahn T.W. Yeager M. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7112-7117Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that the two MPs p7 and p9 from carmoviruses provide a simple model system to study structure/function relationships of plant virus MPs (20Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Perez-Paya E. Pallas V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), given their small size and separate functions (Refs. 20Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Perez-Paya E. Pallas V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 21Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholarand the present work). RNA binding properties were demonstrated for CarMV p7 (20Marcos J.F. Vilar M. Perez-Paya E. Pallas V. Virology. 1999; 255: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and recently we used a retrostructural approach to show that the protein is divided into three structural (and likely functional) domains (21Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar): a variable and unstructured N terminus, a central helical RNA-binding domain, and a very conserved C terminus that folds into a β-sheet. In the present work, we demonstrate that its partner CarMV p9 is an intrinsic membrane protein with two transmembrane helices and Ncyt-Ccyttopology. The results obtained for TMV MP and CarMVp9 reveal a membrane-spanning character of MPs with a likely relevant role in the mechanism of plant virus infection. TMV MP behaves as an integral membrane protein because it has been shown that treatment with salts or urea does not release its association with ER isolated from infected cells (34Reichel C. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11169-11174Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our data show that CarMV p9 is similarly difficult to dissociate from ER microsomes into which it was inserted in vitro. It has been suggested that TMV MP uses the ER for transport from the sites of viral synthesis to plasmodesmata (14Heinlein M. Padgett H.S. Gens J.S. Pickard B.G. Casper S.J. Epel B.L. Beachy R.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1107-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), which in fact do contain ER, and viral infection promotes dramatic morphological changes in ER. However, the targeting of TMV MP to ER is not understood. Like many other plant viral MPs, it does not contain an apparent ER signal sequence (36Deom C.M. Wolf S. Holt C.A. Lucas W.J. Beachy R.N. Virology. 1991; 180: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro translation experiments of TMV MP in the presence of membranes, similar to those described in the present study, failed to detect association with membranes (cited in Ref. 14Heinlein M. Padgett H.S. Gens J.S. Pickard B.G. Casper S.J. Epel B.L. Beachy R.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1107-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been hypothesized that the association of TMV MP with a host-encoded and cell wall-associated pectin methyl-esterase may provide a location signal in trans to deliver the MP to its site of action (37Chen M.H. Sheng J. Hind G. Handa A.K. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, ours is the first report that demonstrates that a plant viral MP contains in its amino acid sequence all of the molecular information required for its targeting and integration into a biological membrane in the absence of additional viral or plant host proteins/components. Furthermore, the first TM1 segment of p9 is sufficient to drive the targeting and insertion into the ER membrane (as deduced from the membrane insertion experiments using the protein chimera p9TM1/P2; Fig. 4). There is a need for topological determination and structural characterization of MPs that will help to unravel the virus movement mechanism(s). The actual topology of CarMV p9 in membranes, as deduced from our experimental data using full-length constructs, shows clearly that p9 is anchored in the membrane through two membrane-spanning domains with its N terminus and, chiefly, its C terminus facing the cytoplasm. This particular topological arrangement allows the highly charged C terminus of p9 to be fully accessible toward the cell cytoplasm. In the absence of three-dimensional data and given the difficulty of such studies on a membrane protein, we have further characterized CarMV p9 using a retrostructural approach based on three synthetic peptides that cover most of the CarMV p9 sequence. As expected, the two hydrophobic segments both adopt an α-helical conformation in a membrane-mimetic environment, and TM1 (i.e. the “targeting” domain) has even higher helical propensity than TM2 (Fig. 1 C). The C-terminal domain of the protein, which is highly polar (with an abundance of Ser and Thr residues) and has a region well conserved in terms of amino acid sequence (Fig.1 A), showed a CD spectrum indicative of low secondary structure content that can be induced to fold into a β-sheet in a membrane mimetic environment (Fig.1 D). We have previously reported that CarMV p7 also has a highly conserved β-sheet C-terminal domain (21Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, these two conserved β-sheet domains could mediate protein-protein interactions between membrane-bound p9 and its soluble partner p7, either unbound or bound RNA (see our hypothetical model in Fig.6). It should also be noticed that in the homologous system from turnip crinkle virus, cellular fractionation experiments have shown that turnip crinkle carmovirus p8 (the p7 homologue) is associated with membrane structures both in transgenic and in virus-infected plants (38Li W.Z., Qu, F. Morris T.J. Virology. 1998; 244: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although p8 itself does not contain either ER targeting signals or TM domains. In the case of CarMV p7, it has been recently shown that the amount of protein in membrane-associated fractions increases with time after plant infection. 2V. Pallás, personal communication. In this alluring model, p7 would bind viral RNA, which would induce a conformational change in this soluble protein, unveiling its C terminus, which could then interact with the cytoplasm-exposed C-terminal domain of p9. This RNA-mediated protein-protein interaction would confine the ternary complex to the membrane. An inference of our model is that although multiple p7 molecules would wrap (and protect) a single viral RNA (as demonstrated in vitro) (21Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), only one monomer of p9 is theoretically required to target the complex to the membrane, and thus lower amounts of this protein would be required. This points to a difference with the TMV system in which the two functions (RNA binding and membrane location) are performed by the same protein and correlates with experimental data on the relative amounts of p7/p9 in the cell. Although p7 and turnip crinkle carmovirus p8 have been detected unambiguously in infected tissue (21Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Li W.Z., Qu, F. Morris T.J. Virology. 1998; 244: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), CarMV p9 (or any of its homologues) has not, confirming the lower accumulation predicted by the model. The accumulation differences also relate to the expression strategy of the two genes from a single viral subgenomic RNA in which the p9 open reading frame is located downstream of p7 and far from the 5′ end (17Qu F. Morris T.J. Granoff A. Webster R.G. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 243-247Crossref Google Scholar,18Russo M. Burgyan J. Martelli G.P. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 381-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the carmovirus two-MP system reproduces the topological model previously suggested for the 30-kDa MP of TMV (10Brill L.M. Nunn R.S. Kahn T.W. Yeager M. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7112-7117Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in which, as is the case for p9, the N and C termini are exposed to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). In this sense, it is important to emphasize that carmovirus MPs are not included in the 30-kDa superfamily of viral MPs (8Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Ryabov E.V. Dolja V.V. J. Gen.

Both wild type (WT) and mutant GPCRs have been discovered to be spontaneously active and to adopt an active (R*) conformation in absence of agonists (4Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J.

In the simplest model, GPCRs exist in a dynamic equilibrium between active (R*) and inactive (R) states governed by an allosteric constant (J = [R]/[R*]). Different models have been proposed to simulate the transition of receptor between ligand or G protein-bound states. In the extended ternary complex, R* interacts with the G protein either spontaneously (R*G) or through agonist binding (AR*G). In the cubic ternary complex model, both the R and R* states interact with the G protein (for a review, see Ref. 7Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The efficacy of a ligand is thought to be a function of its relative affinity for R and R*. Therefore, neutral antagonists have equal affinity for both receptor states, agonists preferentially bind to R*, thereby shifting the position of equilibrium toward active conformation, and inverse agonists preferentially bind to R, shifting the position of equilibrium toward the inactive state. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of multiple active and inactive conformations. A model of these multiple conformations has been proposed (2Gether U. Endocrinol.

Understanding the function of GPCRs at a molecular level requires better understanding of the mechanisms by which the binding of agonists and inverse agonists preferentially stabilizes the R* and R conformations, respectively. An important contribution to this understanding was the identification of key residues, which, when altered by mutation, led to increased constitutive activity of GPCRs (i.e. accumulation of R* in the absence of agonists). These residues have been identified not only in the intracellular domains known to be involved in G protein activation, but also in transmembrane domains (TMDs) and even in some cases in extracellular domains. Most of these residues have been proposed to participate in networks of intramolecular interactions, which stabilize the receptors in inactive conformations R. Disruption of these networks results in a conformational shift from R to R* (2Gether U. Endocrinol. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 10Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B.

Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Similar intramolecular interactions have been demonstrated for α1A-adrenoceptors between Asp-1253.32 of TMD-III and Lys-3317.43 in TMD-VII. Activation of this receptor is believed to result from the disruption of the Asp-125-Lys-331 salt bridge by the neurotransmitter biogenic amine that acts as counter-ion of the Asp-125 (11Porter J.E. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34535-34538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism of receptor activation is likely to be specific for α1B-adrenergic receptor, since the Lys in TMD-VII is not conserved within related GPCRs sequences. β2-Adrenergic receptors are kept under an inactive state by an ionic lock between the adjacent Arg and Asp of the DRY (D3.49R3.50Y3.51) sequence (cytoplasmic end of TMD-III) and a conserved Glu in the cytoplasmic end of TMD-VI (Glu-2686.30 in β2-adrenergic receptor) (13Ballesteros J.A.

For several GPCRs, charge-neutralizing mutations of these residues increase constitutive activity by disrupting this lock (15Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T., De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). In rhodopsin, similar disruption is observed following protonation of the Glu in the ERY sequence (equivalent to the DRY sequence) and another acidic residue that could be the conserved Glu of TMD-VI (18Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support the idea that the disruption of intramolecular interactions constitutes the receptor activation switch, although the precise residues involved in these interactions may vary between different receptors. Such a hypothesis is also supported by the observation that constitutively active receptors are characterized by structural instability (16Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to the rapid progress in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from R to R*, mechanisms by which inverse agonists favor the conversion from R* to R (inactive conformation) remain unclear. An important observation was that mutations of residues that constrain the receptor in the inactive state lead to constitutively activated receptors that can be switched back to an inactive state by inverse agonists. This suggests to us that inverse agonist action may implicate different constraining networks than those disrupted by agonists. The present study, combining mutagenesis, pharmacology, and molecular modeling of 5-HT4 receptor, sheds new light on this issue. We previously reported that 5-HT4 receptors display high constitutive activity under wild type and mutated forms (20Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bécamel C. Parmentier M.-L. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bécamel C. Eglen R. Clark R.D. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, three mutations are reported (D1003.32A in TMD-III and F2756.51A and W2726.48A in TMD-VI) that completely blocked the effects of inverse agonists while keeping their specific binding on the receptor. Besides, when combined with other potent constitutively activating mutations, these three mutations were discovered to be “dominant” as inverse agonist effects were still blocked. Surprisingly, they also left unchanged molecular activation switches induced by agonists. Molecular modeling revealed a network of interactions between these three residues. The mutants were generated by exchanging the endogenous residues to alanine in the m5-HT4(a) R cDNA sequence with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The sense primers used were: F2756.51A, 5′-CTG TTT CTG CTG GGC CCC CGC CTT TG-3′; D1003.32A, 5′-ACC TCT CTG GCT GTC CTA CTC ACC-3′; W2726.48A, 5′-CTG TTT CTG CGC GGC CCC CTT CTT-3′; S1975.43A, 5′-TAT GCT ATC ACC TGC GCT GTG GT-3′; R1183.50A, 5′-TTC CCT GGA CGC TTA TTA CGC CAT-3′; N3087.49D, 5′-GGT TGG ACC CTT TTC TCT ATG CCT-3′; T1344.38A, 5′-TGC GTA GAG GGG CCA TCT TGT TCC-3′. The cDNAs, subcloned into pRK5, were introduced into COS-7 cells by electroporation. Briefly, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in EP buffer (50 mm K2HPO4, 20 mmCH3CO2K, 20 mm KOH, 26.7 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) with 25–2000 ng of receptor cDNA. The total amount of cDNA was kept constant at 15 μg per transfection with wild type pRK5 vector. After 15 min at room temperature, 300 ml of cell suspension (107 cells) were transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) and pulsed with a gene pulser apparatus (setting 1000 millifarads, 270 V). Cells were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; 106 cells/ml) containing 10% dialyzed and decomplemented fetal bovine serum (dFBS) and plated on 10-cm Falcon Petri dishes or into 12-well clusters at the desired density. Six hours after transfection, the surrounding cell medium was exchanged for DMEM without dFBS with 2 mCi of [3H]adenine/ml to label the ATP pool and incubated overnight. cAMP accumulation was measured as described previously (22Dumuis A. Bouhelal R. Sebben M. Cory R. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 880-887PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from transiently transfected cells plated on 15-cm dishes and grown in DMEM with 10% dFBS for 6 h, followed by incubation for 20 h in DMEM without dFBS. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped with a rubber policeman, harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 4 °C (200 × g for 4 min). The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.32 msucrose and homogenized 10 times with a glass-Teflon potter at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, (5 mg of protein in 1 ml of solution) and stored at −80 °C until use. 5-HT4 receptor densities were estimated with the specific radioligand [3H]GR113808 at saturating concentration (0.4–0.6 nm,K d = 0.12 nm) as described previously (23Ansanay H. Sebben M. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 298: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 5-HT (50 μm) or RS100325 (10 μm) was used to determine nonspecific binding. Protein concentration in the samples was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Using Kaleidagraph software, the dose-response curves were fitted according to the equation, Y=((ymax−ymin)/(1+x/EC50)nH))+yminEquation 1 where EC50 (or EC50inv) is the concentration of agonist (or inverse agonist) that evokes a half-maximal response; y max andy min correspond to the maximal and minimal responses, respectively; and n H is the Hill coefficient. Statistical differences were examined with the Stat-View Student program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) with ttests. GR113808 ([1-[2(methylsulfonyl-amino)ethyl]4-piperidinyl]methyl-1-methyl-indole-3 carboxylate, maleate) and GR125487 ([1-[2-(methylsulfonyl-amino)ethyl]4-piperidinyl]methyl-5-fluoro-2-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxylate, hydrochloride) were generously donated by Glaxo (Ware, Herts, UK); [3H]GR 113808 was purchased from AmershamBiosciences; 5-HT (serotonin) was purchased from Sigma. BIMU8 ([endo-N-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo(3.2.1)oct-3-yl]-2,3-dihydro-3-isopropyl-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxamide hydrochloride) was obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim (Milan, Italy). RS100235 (1-(8-amino-7-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzo(1,4)dioxin-5-yl)-3-{1-[3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-propan-1-one hydrochloride salt), RO116-0086 (2,3-dihydrobenzo-(1,4)-dioxine-5-carboxylic acid 1-butyl-piperidin-4-ylmethyl ester hydrochloride salt), RO116-1148 (2,3-dihydrobenzo-(1,4)-dioxine-5-carboxylic acid 1-butyl-piperidin-4-ylmethylamide hydrochloride salt) were generously donated by Roche Bioscience (Palo Alto, CA). A model of the transmembrane domain in the mouse 5-HT4receptor was constructed using the bovine rhodopsin structure (Protein Data Bank code: 1F88:A) as a template. Receptor sequence alignment was determined using GRAP Mutant data base (tGRAP.uit.no/fam1asel.html). All 5-HT4 receptor modeling was conducted following virtual truncation of certain amino acid residues: 1–10 of the N-terminal region, 163–183 of the e2 loop, 219–250 of the i3 loop, and 332–387 of the C-terminal region. Five different models were developed using the program Modeler in the Insight-II environment (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics R10000 O2 work station. Although these models generated very similar molecular structures, the findings reported here are based on the model that returned the best three-dimensional likeness of rhodopsin. This model was submitted to energy minimization using the program Discover 3 and the consistent force field. Cα-trace was tethered by applying a force constant value of the quadratic potential of 100. A steepest descent followed by a conjugate gradient method then was applied until convergence with 0.5 kcal mol−1 Å−1 root mean square energy gradient difference between successive minimization steps. GR125487 and SB207266 have previously been described to be inverse agonists at the 5-HT4 receptor (21Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bécamel C. Eglen R. Clark R.D. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To find new 5-HT4 receptor inverse agonists we synthetized numerous compounds having common pharmacophoric features with the SB204070, a specific benzoate dioxane 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (25Gaster L.M. Sanger G.J. Drugs Future. 1994; 19: 1109-1121Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Among them, two highly potent inverse agonists were identified, RO116-0086, a benzoate dioxane that is the des-amino, des-chloro version of SB204070, and RO116-1148, which is the corresponding amide. By measurement of cAMP accumulation in cell lines that transiently express wild type 5-HT4(a) receptor, both RO116-0086 and RO116-1148 were found to have high potencies (EC50inv = 0.3 ± 0.1 nm) and high efficacies. Indeed, they inhibited 80% of basal constitutive activity, i.e. cAMP accumulation above mock cAMP accumulation, in the absence of agonist (Fig. 1 B). Both are much more potent and efficacious than previously described 5-HT4inverse agonists (21Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bécamel C. Eglen R. Clark R.D. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Screening for mutations that would impair the efficacy of inverse agonists without modifying the agonist-induced activation, we analyzed the mutation of Asp-1003.32. This highly conserved residue within the biogenic amine receptor family (26Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar) is believed to make an ionic interaction with neurotransmitters protonated amine. As expected, 5-HT was completely unable to stimulate the D100A mutated receptor (Fig.2 A), due to its loss of binding (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the binding of the labeled antagonist [3H]GR113808 was only slightly affected by the mutation (K D = 0.12 ± 0.05 nm and 0.26 ± 0.04 nm at WT and D100A receptors, respectively). In contrast to 5-HT, the benzimidazolone derivative BIMU8 remained fully and even showed a higher potency on the D100A mutant than on the WT 5-HT4 receptor. The EC50 values for cAMP stimulation were equal to 4 ± 1.5 and 1 ± 0.5 nm for WT and D100A, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Affinity of BIMU8 for 5-HT4 receptor was also slightly better on the D100A mutant than on the WT.K D values for BIMU8 measured by competition with the [3H]GR113808 radioligand were 30 ± 11 nm and 6.5 ± 3 nm for WT and D100A, respectively (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the D1003.32A mutant has not lost the ability to be activated as long as the agonist is able to bind. When expressed at densities ranging from 200 up to 10,000 fmol/mg of protein, the basal level of cAMP synthesis of the D100A mutant was 1.5–2-fold higher than that of WT. Receptor expression levels of WT or D100A were also not significantly different following transfection of 300 ng of cDNA (1350 ± 60 and 1580 ± 60 pmol/mg of protein for WT and D100A, respectively). Whereas, as already discussed, highly potent inverse agonists (RO116-0086, RO116-1148) blocked the WT constitutive activity, they were absolutely unable to inhibit basal constitutive activity of the D100A mutant (Fig. 3 A). This effect is not unique to these two newly highly potent inverse agonists; similar results were obtained with the previously described 5-HT4 receptor inverse agonists, GR125487 and SB207266 (21Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bécamel C. Eglen R. Clark R.D. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This effect can therefore not be attributed to a loss of binding to the D100A mutant receptor, as shown in Fig.4, A and B. RO116-0086 competition binding experiments showed a very small decrease in affinity for D100A (K d = 3 ± 1.4 × 10−10m) relative to WT (K d = 8.4 ± 2.6 × 10−11m). RO116-1148 showed a 10-fold decrease in affinity for D100A (K d = 5.1 ± 1.8 × 10−9m) as compared with the WT (K d = 4.7 ± 1.5 × 10−10m).Figure 4The binding of the 5-HT4 receptor inverse agonists was conserved in the mutated D1003.32A receptor. Competition binding was performed for the inverse agonists (RO116-0086 (A) and RO116-1148 (B)), in the presence of 0.24 nm [3H]GR113808. The assays were carried out on membranes derived from COS-7 cells and expressing similar levels of WT or D100A receptor (2500 ± 180 and 2650 ± 210 fmol/mg of protein, respectively). Results are expressed as a percent of the specific binding in the absence of a competing ligand. Representative data are presented from one of six replicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding of these inverse agonists to the D100A mutant was confirmed by the capacity of these compounds to behave as antagonist of the BIMU8-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3, B andC). The influence of receptor expression on inverse agonist activity was then analyzed. While the receptor constitutive activity increased as expected as a function of the receptor concentration, RO116-1148 remained totally inactive as inverse agonist on the D100A mutant (Fig.5 B). In comparison, its effect on WT receptor was constant whatever the receptor concentration (Fig.5 A). Thus, a mutant was generated that was fully activated by but insensitive to inverse agonists despite the ability of these later to bind to the receptor. In a previous study we showed that either truncation of the C-terminal domain of 5-HT4 receptor (Δ3277.70) or the A2586.34L mutation in the third intracellular loop elevated the constitutive activity relative to the WT 5-HT4 receptor (21Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bécamel C. Eglen R. Clark R.D. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A). At both of these mutations, 5-HT and BIMU8 increased cAMP synthesis over basal (Fig. 6 B), and RO116-1148 decreased cAMP synthesis relative to basal (Fig. 6, C and D). Following dual mutation of D100A+Δ327 or D100A+A258L, the inverse agonist property of RO116-1148 was lost (Fig. 6, C and D). Furthermore, as expected 5-HT was inactive on these double mutants, whereas as on D100A, BIMU8 remained fully efficient (Fig.6 B). Taken together, these results showed that the D100A+Δ327 and D100A+A258L dual mutants were qualitatively similar in their pharmacological behavior to the D100A mutant on its own. Thus, the D100A mutant is a dominant mutant. It blocked the effects of inverse agonists on constitutively activated 5-HT4receptors, whatever the nature or intensity of the constitutive activation. We investigated the effects of mutation of other residues known to be involved in the binding of 5-HT or the constitutive activation of the receptor (Fig.7 A). The T1344.38A mutation is located in the second intracellular loop (Thr-1344.38 is a conserved threonine in many 5-HT receptors (27Lembo P.M. Ghahremani M.H. Morris S.J. Albert P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). The R1183.50A mutation is located at the putative interface between TMD-III and the i2 loop (Arg-118 residue belongs to the DRY sequence). In addition to the D100A mutant, four mutants were generated in the membrane-spanning regions. The Ser-1975.43 of TMD-V, which likely interacts via a hydrogen bond with the OH of 5-HT, was mutated into Ala (S197A). Two highly conserved aromatic residues of TMD-VI (F2756.51A and W2726.48A) (28Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were mutated into Ala. The Asn residue in of TMD-VII (Asn-3087.49), which is conserved across the family 1 GPCRs, was mutated to Asp. The S197A, T134A, and F275A mutants were similar to the WT receptor in their levels of constitutive activity. The N308D and R118A mutants had levels of constitutive activity, similar to that of D100A (Fig.7 B). Of all the mutants investigated, we found only F275A to be similar to D100A in its insensitivity to the potent inverse agonist, RO116-1148 (Fig. 7, B and C). As with the D100A mutation, the absence of effect of RO116-1148 cannot be attributed to an absence of binding. Competition binding experiments with RO116-1148 demonstrated a very small decrease in the affinity for F275A (9 ± 2.3 × 10−10m) relative to WT (4.7 ± 1.5 × 10−10m) (Fig.8 A). In addition, the 5-HT-mediated cAMP accumulation at this F275A mutant was antagonized by RO116-1148 (Fig. 8 B). The W272A mutant expressed at a standard level of 450 fmol/mg, was totally silent, with a level of basal cAMP accumulation similar to that of mock-transfected controls (Fig. 7 B). However, as shown in Fig. 8 B, the 5-HT efficiency to stimulate cAMP accumulation was the same on the W272A mutant as on WT 5-HT4 receptor. Since it displayed no constitutive activity at all, this silent mutant was, by definition, insensitive to the inverse agonist activity of RO116-1148. To check if this mutation was also a dominant mutation that prevents the effect of inverse agonists, we performed dual mutation studies with the constitutively active mutant, A258L. The W272A+A258L mutant was found to have a modest level of constitutive activity (Fig. 7 B). Note that this modest constitutive activity could not be further increased, due to a low expression level of W272A mutant. The same phenomenon was already observed with a mutation of the 5-HT2A receptor when the analogous tryptophan was mutated into alanine at W3366.48A (29Roth B.L. Shoham M. Choudhary M.S. Khan N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, if modest, this basal level of cAMP accumulation was sufficient to reveal that RO116-1148 did not induce detectable decreases in basal cAMP accumulation (Fig. 7 C). Competition binding studies with [3H]GR113808 demonstrated that RO116-1148 binds to the W272A mutant (1.14 ± 0.3 × 10−9m) with a very small decrease in affinity relative to WT (Fig. 8 A). In addition, the 5-HT-mediated cAMP accumulation at this W272A mutant was antagonized by RO116-1148 (Fig. 8 B). Taken together, these results revealed that two mutations (W2726.48A and F2756.51A), in addition to the D1003.32A mutatio"
https://openalex.org/W1970553620,"The T4 bacteriophage gene e.1 was cloned into an expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was identified as a Nudix hydrolase active on FAD, adenosine 5′-triphospho-5′-adenosine (Ap3A), and ADP-ribose. Typical of members of the Nudix hydrolases, the enzyme has an alkaline pH optimum (pH 8) and requires a divalent cation for activity that can be satisfied by Mg2+or Mn2+. For all substrates, AMP is one of the products, and unlike most of the other enzymes active on Ap3A, the T4 enzyme hydrolyzes higher homologues including Ap4–6A. This is the first member of the Nudix hydrolase gene superfamily identified in bacterial viruses and the only one present in T4. Although the protein was predicted to be orthologous to E. coli MutT on the basis of a sequence homology search, the properties of the gene and of the purified protein do not support this notion because of the following. (a) The purified enzyme hydrolyzes substrates not acted upon by MutT, and it does not hydrolyze canonical MutT substrates. (b) The e.1 gene does not complement mutT1 in vivo. (c) The deletion of e.1 does not increase the spontaneous mutation frequency of T4 phage. The properties of the enzyme most closely resemble those of Orf186 of E. coli, the product of thenudE gene, and we therefore propose the mnemonicnudE.1 for the T4 phage orthologue.

Although the protein was predicted to be orthologous to E. coli MutT on the basis of a sequence homology search, the properties of the gene and of the purified protein do not support this notion because of the following. (a) The purified enzyme hydrolyzes substrates not acted upon by MutT, and it does not hydrolyze canonical MutT substrates. (b) The e.1 gene does not complement mutT1 in vivo. (c) The deletion of e.1 does not increase the spontaneous mutation frequency of T4 phage. The properties of the enzyme most closely resemble those of Orf186 of E. coli, the product of thenudE gene, and we therefore propose the mnemonicnudE.1 for the T4 phage orthologue. adenosine 5′-triphospho-5′-adenosine diadenosine polyphosphates kanamycin resistance ampicillin resistance The Nudix hydrolase superfamily consists of widely distributed subfamilies of enzymes characterized by a shared structural motif: the Nudix box having a highly conserved consensus sequence,GXXXXXEXXXXXXXREUXEEXGUSEQUENCE1where “X ” represents any amino acid, and U usually represents one of the bulky, hydrophobic amino acids, Ile, Leu, or Val (1Bessman M.J.

These are all enzymes active on nucleoside diphosphate derivatives including (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, coenzymes, cell signaling molecules, and nucleotide sugars (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N.

An examination of the T4 bacteriophage genome reveals one gene,e.1 (GenBankTM accession numbers NC_000866 and NP_049737) coding for an open reading frame containing a consensus Nudix box signature sequence (Fig.1).

In this paper we describe the cloning of e.1, its expression in E. coli, its purification, and its identification not as an orthologue of MutT but as a new member of the Nudix hydrolases active on FAD, ADP-ribose, and Ap3A.1 This represents the first member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily cloned, expressed, and characterized from a bacteriophage. In keeping with the nomenclature for the Nudix hydrolase genes of the E. coliand human genomes, we propose to assign the mnemonic nudE.1to this gene in T4 bacteriophage in recognition of its originale.1 designation, and also because the enzyme it signifies most closely resembles NudE in E. coli. The expression plasmid pET-24a(+) (Kmr) and E. coli HMS174 (DE3) were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Phages L1/a (a lysozyme amber mutant, referred to as eam in the text) and rII NB 3034 were from the collection of Larry Gold, University of Colorado, Boulder. The bacteria CR63 (supD), CR63λ (supD, λ lysogen), NapIV (supD), and NapIV (sup0 ) were from the bacterial strain collection of Larry Gold (15Nelson M.A. Erickson M. Gold L. Pulitzer J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 188: 60-68Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). T4 strains used as templates for cloning the e.1 gene were gifts of Linda Reha-Krantz, University of Alberta, Canada, and Lindsay W. Black, University of Maryland. The T4 DNA used as a template for PCR was extracted by following the procedure described by Sambrook and Russell (16Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 2.54-2.58Google Scholar). The plasmid pTrc99A (Ampr) and Sephadex G-100 were from Amersham Biosciences, and the restriction enzymes, PCR kits, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The plasmid pCR®2.1-Topo® is a product of Invitrogen. The homogeneous E. coli MutT (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase was prepared according to Bhatnagar and Bessman (12Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the substrates and common chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich or Invitrogen. The PCR primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, WI) or the Great American Gene Co. (Ramona, CA), and the Bradford protein assay reagent (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 242-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) was from Bio-Rad. The gel filtration sizing column, HiLoadTM 16/60 SuperdexTM 75 was from Amersham Biosciences. Genee.1 was amplified from strain T4 DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. NdeI and BamHI sites were incorporated at the start and the end of the gene, respectively. The amplified gene was purified, digested with NdeI andBamHI, and ligated into pET-24a(+) to place e.1under the control of the T7 lac promoter. The resultant plasmid, pETe.1, was transformed into E. coliDH5a for storage and into HMS174 (DE3) for protein expression. Gene e.1, containing NcoI and BamHI sites, was amplified from the above pETe.1 and ligated into the respective sites of pTrc99A to form pTrce.1 under the control of thetrc promoter. The plasmid pCR2.1ΔnudE.1 contains a constructed Swa1 deletion that removes the amino-terminal half of thenudE.1 gene. This mutant allele is referred to asnudE.1Δ1. eam phage (1 × 109/ml) were used to infect exponentially growing NapIV supD (2 × 108/ml) with or without plasmid pCR2.1ΔnudE.1. After 90 min, chloroform was added to induce lysis, and the diluted progeny were plated on permissive and non-permissive NapIV.eam -infected cells containing the pCR2.1ΔnudE.1 plasmid produced a 100-fold greater frequency of e + phage than the control infection (data not shown). The recombination event that selected thee + allele may replace the nudE.1 gene of the phage with the nudE.1Δ1 allele of the plasmid. 24 e+ phage plaques were screened for the nudE.1Δ1 allele by PCR on DNA extracted by the method of Jozwik and Miller (18Jozwik C.E. Miller E.S. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1994: 464-465Google Scholar). One of the 24 plaques yielded phage with the deletion in e.1. One colony of the expression strain pETe.1/HMS174(DE3) was inoculated into 40 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, incubated at 37 °C over night, and inoculated into 2 liters of the same medium. When the culture reached an A 600 of 0.3, it was transferred to an incubator at 22 °C and grown to anA 600 of 0.8. At this point, isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were grown for an additional 12 h, harvested, and washed in buffered saline. The washed cells were suspended in 2.5 volumes of 50 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol (buffer A), disrupted in a French press, and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was adjusted to about 10 mg of protein/ml with buffer A (Fraction I). Streptomycin was added to a final concentration of 1.5%, and the precipitated nucleoproteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant (Fraction II) was brought to 50% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected and dissolved in a minimal volume of buffer A (Fraction III). Fraction III was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column in buffer A plus 200 mm sodium chloride. The fractions containing the e.1 protein were pooled and stored at −80 °C (Fraction IV). The enzyme assay measures the conversion of a phosphatase-resistant substrate to a phosphatase-sensitive product. A standard reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mmTris·Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm Mg2+, 2 mmsubstrate, 4 units of alkaline phosphatase, and 0.1–2 milliunits of enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The inorganic orthophosphate liberated was assayed by the colorimetric procedure of Ames and Dubin (19Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates are tested as substrates, the assay must be modified since alkaline intestinal phosphatase is active on triphosphates, and also there is a slow hydrolysis of triphosphates to inorganic orthophosphate during the course of color development. In this case, the alkaline phosphatase is replaced by 0.5 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and the reaction is terminated by the addition of Norit, which adsorbs the residual nucleoside triphosphates. An aliquot of the Norit supernatant is then used for the determination of inorganic orthophosphate as above. In both assays, a unit of enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate/min. ThenudE.1 gene cloned into pTrc99A was transformed intoE. coli strain SB3 (12Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) lacking a functionalmutT gene. The number of colonies resistant to nalidixic acid were compared with a control of SB3 transformed with pTrc99A lacking the gene nudE.1 insert. The cloned gene was sequenced, and it was congruent with that reported fore.1 (nucleotides 67037–67490 of the T4 genome, GenBankTM accession number NC_000866). The gene expressed well at 37 °C, but almost all of the extracted protein was insoluble and precipitated during centrifugation. At 22 °C, the expression rate was reduced, but the yield was comparable to that at the higher temperature, and under these conditions the protein was found almost entirely in the soluble fraction suitable for purification. After chromatography on a Sephadex G-100 sizing column, the protein appeared highly purified when analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing gel; but as shown in Fig.2, a satellite band is visible slightly below the bulk of the protein. Analyses of the amino-terminal regions of both bands indicated that the less abundant, faster moving species was five amino acids shorter than the major band, most likely resulting from an internal start on a methionine codon located in this position. No attempts were made to remove this slightly truncated species from the bulk of the protein. Since the e.1gene was predicted to be an orthologue of MutT (10Kawabata T. Arisaka F.A. Nishikawa K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 259: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the first candidate substrates we tried were (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, known to be rapidly hydrolyzed by E. coli MutT (13Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) However, no significant hydrolysis was observed. Since all enzymes containing the Nudix box signature sequence so far discovered hydrolyze several different nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, we surveyed a large selection and found that FAD, Ap3A, and ADP-ribose were favored substrates. These data are shown in TableI. For comparison, the specificity of MutT is also shown. It is obvious that the two enzymes have strikingly different specificities with no overlap. In each case, the preferred substrates of one are not substrates of the other. On the other hand, the T4 enzyme resembles Orf186 of E. coli (20O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in its spectrum of favored substrates, the most notable difference being the higher activity on FAD. This is also shown in Table I where the enzymes can be directly compared. Because of their similarity, we proposed the mnemonic nudE.1 to designate the T4 gene to signal its relationship to the orthologous gene coding for Orf186 namednudE in the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. A summary of the kinetic properties of the T4 enzyme is shown in Table II. Although FAD has the highest V max, it also has the highestK m . In terms of catalytic efficiency,K cat/K m , Ap3A and ADP-ribose have 2–3 times higher activity, respectively.Table ISubstrate specificitySubstrate1-aGp5G, diguanosine pentaphosphate.T4 Nudix hydrolase E. coliMutT E. coli Orf186Specific activityRelative activitySpecific activityRelative activitySpecific activityRelative activity units/mg % units/mg % units/mg %FAD95 100<101138Ap3A7579<102793ADP-ribose6467<1029 100Ap4A5255<10Ap5A5154Ap2A4952NADH41432172ADP-mannose2021CoA88ADP-glucose33NADPH<10NAD+<10Gp5G<10UDP-mannose<10GDP-mannose<10dGTP<1034 100<18-Oxo-dGTP<103190All substrates were present at a concentration of 2 mm and were assayed as described under “Methods.” The data for E. coli Orf186 are taken from Ref. 20O'Handley S.F.

A unit of enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of substrate/min under optimal conditions. The standard assay described under “Methods” was used, and substrates were varied between 0.1–4 mm.K m and V max were calculated from a non-linear regression analysis. A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under standard conditions. A common mechanism of virtually all members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily studied so far is a nucleophilic attack by water on a pyrophosphate linkage in the substrate. An analysis of the products of hydrolysis of FAD, ADP-ribose, and a series of diadenosine polyphosphates indicates that the T4 enzyme also uses this mechanism. As identified by high performance liquid chromatography, all three substrates liberate AMP as one of the products, and no inorganic orthophosphate is formed during the course of the reaction. The stoichiometry may therefore be described by the following equations. FAD+H2O→AMP+FMNEquation 1 ADP­ribose+H2O→AMP+ribose­5­PEquation 2 ApnA+H2O→AMP+Apn−1Equation 3 Several aspects of the hydrolysis of the diadenosine polyphosphate series of compounds are surprising. First, although Ap3A is the best substrate of the group, Ap4A is hydrolyzed at about 70% of the rate, and there is practically no diminution in rate for the next two higher homologues. This is uncharacteristic for enzymes hydrolyzing diadenosine polyphosphates, Nudix hydrolases or otherwise, since those enzymes active on Ap3A are generally not active on the higher homologues. An example may be seen in Table Iwhere Orf186 is highly active on Ap3A but has little or no activity on Ap4A. Second, no inorganic orthophosphate is formed during the course of hydrolysis indicating that the immediate products formed (ADP, ATP, adenosine tetraphosphate, etc.) are not further degraded. Many of the ApnA pyrophosphatases further degrade their initial products. Third, one of the hydrolytic products is always AMP independent of the length of the polyphosphate linker. This means that the nucleophilic attack must always occur on the α or β phosphorus, which is unique among this class of enzymes. The other diadenosine polyphosphate pyrophosphatases release AMP, ADP, or ATP depending on the length of the polyphosphate linker, and the nucleophilic attack occurs at the γ or δ phosphorus. For a review, see Guranowski (21Guranowski A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the products formed from the hydrolysis of ApnA wheren = 3, 4, or 5. For each of the substrates, AMP is one of the two products. Ap6A was also cleaved to AMP and adenosine pentaphosphate (data not shown). The T4 enzyme has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation, and under optimal concentrations Mn2+ is about 60% as effective as Mg2+. No other cations tested including Zn2+, Ca2+, or Co2+ are effectual. In keeping with almost all of the Nudix hydrolases, the enzyme has an alkaline pH optimum of about 8.0. Although the purified enzyme has a calculated molecular mass of 17,653 Da and migrates on an electrophoretic denaturing gel with the expected mobility (see Fig. 2), it eluted from a calibrated gel filtration column at the position characteristic of a 30-kDa protein. One interpretation of this anomaly is that the protein is a homodimer with an asymmetric Stokes radius, causing it to appear smaller than the 35 kDa we would expect of a dimer. Another possibility is that the protein is retarded by nonspecific interactions with the column matrix. We favor the former interpretation because this same column has given reliable measurements, under the same conditions, for several other proteins. It is interesting that E. coli Orf186, the enzyme most closely resembling the T4 enzyme in respect to substrate specificity, is also most likely a homodimer (20O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A more comprehensive study would have to be instituted to arrive at a definitive answer. Although the substrate specificity of the T4 enzyme was not characteristic of known MutT orthologues (Table I), we also tested the ability of T4 nudE.1 to complement a mutT −strain in vivo. The data in Table III show that no significant diminution in forward mutation frequency to nalidixic acid resistance occurred when the mutator strain was transformed with a plasmid containing the nudE.1 gene. This observation taken together with the aforementioned enzymatic studies makes it highly unlikely that nudE.1 is an orthologue ofmutT. 2The deletion of nudE.1 does not increase the forward mutation frequency to acridine resistance (W.L. Xu, P. Gauss, J.Y. Shen, C. A. Dunn, and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations).Table IIINon-complementation of mutT − by T4 e.1SB3/pTrc99ASB3/pTrc99AmutTSB3/pTrc99Ae.1 nalr/10 94364 ± 1599<103948 ± 1611SB3 (mutT1) cells transformed with pTrc99A alone or with the plasmid containing the mutT + ore.1 + alleles were plated on nutrient agar with or without 25 μg/ml nalidixic acid. nalr, nalidixic acid resistance.

To assess the importance of gene nudE.1 to phage growth, a deletion mutant, nudE.1Δ1, was constructed as described under “Methods,” and its growth was compared with wild type phage. Table IV shows the results of two separate experiments in which the number of phage/bacterium (burst size) for the wild type and the mutant are listed. No significant differences are evident between the parental and mutant phage. ThusnudE.1 does not appear to be required for normal phage growth and replication under these conditions. According to Kutteret al. (22Kutter E. Kellenberger E. Carlson K. Eddy S. Neitzel J. Messinger L. North J. Guttman B. Karam J.D., Ed. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1994: 406-418Google Scholar), approximately half of the 300 or so genes in T4 phage have unknown functions and are in regions that are likely to be deletable under standard laboratory conditions. It stands to reason that genes important in the physiology and life cycle of T4 inhabiting the colon, its normal ecological niche, may have diminished value when infecting its host, E. coli, growing under optimized conditions of nutrition, atmosphere, climate, and population density. This is especially true of the NudE.1 enzyme since its enzymatic activity parallels Orf186 of its host. As pointed out previously (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), the Nudix hydrolases are surveillance enzymes that are involved in removing potentially toxic metabolites such as ADP-ribose, preventing the accumulation of normal metabolic intermediates, and redirecting them to other areas of metabolism or removing stress-induced signaling molecules such as diadenosine polyphosphates. In its normal habitat of low oxygen tension, overcrowding, and limited nutrition, NudE.1 might play a supportive role in phage growth by carrying out these functions.Table IVBurst sizes of nudE.1 + and nudE.1Δ1PhageBurst size4-aBurst size is number of phage produced/infected bacterium.Experiment 1Experiment 2 nudE.1 +290100 nudE.1Δ1270140E. coli cells were grown at 30 °C to a concentration of 2 × 108/ml and were infected with T4nudE.1 + or nudE.1Δ1 at a multiplicity of 5 phage/bacterium.

After 90 min, the cells were lysed by the addition of chloroform. The data are from two individual experiments. Finally it should be noted that this is another example of proteomics gone astray. Since the first member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily was MutT (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) there has been a tendency to assume that open reading frames containing the Nudix box signature sequence are proteins functionally related to the MutT enzyme, despite the fact that MutT itself is only one member of a large and still growing list of enzymes with unrelated functions. The Nudix box motif is the binding and catalytic site for hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, but the specificity for individual substrates lies outside this region. We have been partially successful in uncovering landmarks distal to the Nudix box that designate family members with related enzymatic activities (23Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and we are continuing our search for these signposts so that reliable predictions can be made relating sequence homology to function. We thank Laura Kohlhepp for assistance in the isolation and characterization of the nudE.1Δ1phage."

https://openalex.org/W2161077147,"We describe a fusion transcript of Gal4 linked to its specific inhibitor protein Gal80 by 276 nucleotides of apolipoprotein (apo) B sequence as a selectable marker for mRNA editing. Editing of apoB mRNA is catalyzed by an editing enzyme complex that introduces a stop codon by deamination of C to U. The catalytic subunit APOBEC-1 is a cytidine deaminase and requires a second essential component recently cloned and termed APOBEC-1 complementing factor (ACF) or APOBEC-1-stimulating protein (ASP). The aim of this study was to demonstrate that APOBEC-1 plus ACF/ASP comprise all that is required for editing of apoB mRNA in vivo. Expression of APOBEC-1 and Gal4 fused to its inhibitor Gal80 by an intervening unedited apoB sequence (Gal4-apoBC-Gal80) did not result in the Gal4-dependent expression of HIS3 and β-galactosidase in the yeast strain CG1945. Co-expression of APOBEC-1 and ACF/ASP induced editing of the apoB site in up to 13% of the Gal4-apoBC-Gal80 transcripts and enabled selection of yeast cells for robust expression of HIS3 and β-galactosidase. Additional expression of the alternative splicing regulatory protein KSRP increased the editing of the apoB site by APOBEC-1 and ACF/ASP to 21%. Thus, APOBEC-1 and ACF/ASP represent the core apoB mRNA editing enzyme in vivo. This study demonstrates for the first time the successful use of a selectable marker for mRNA editing. The Gal4-Gal80 system is analogous to the two-hybrid assay and may have broader applications for the study of other mRNA processing reactions.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate that APOBEC-1 plus ACF/ASP comprise all that is required for editing of apoB mRNA in vivo. Expression of APOBEC-1 and Gal4 fused to its inhibitor Gal80 by an intervening unedited apoB sequence (Gal4-apoBC-Gal80) did not result in the Gal4-dependent expression of HIS3 and β-galactosidase in the yeast strain CG1945. Co-expression of APOBEC-1 and ACF/ASP induced editing of the apoB site in up to 13% of the Gal4-apoBC-Gal80 transcripts and enabled selection of yeast cells for robust expression of HIS3 and β-galactosidase. Additional expression of the alternative splicing regulatory protein KSRP increased the editing of the apoB site by APOBEC-1 and ACF/ASP to 21%. Thus, APOBEC-1 and ACF/ASP represent the core apoB mRNA editing enzyme in vivo. This study demonstrates for the first time the successful use of a selectable marker for mRNA editing. The Gal4-Gal80 system is analogous to the two-hybrid assay and may have broader applications for the study of other mRNA processing reactions. APOBEC-1 complementing factor APOBEC-1-stimulating protein phosphoglycerate kinase KH-type splicing regulatory protein 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole reverse transcription Gal4-apoBC-Gal80 Gal4-apoBU-Gal80 mRNA editing is a genetic regulation that alters gene expression by posttranscriptional nucleotide changes within the coding regions of transcripts. mRNA editing of nuclear-encoded genes consists of site-specific deamination reactions that convert A to I and C to U. In most cases, these base changes result in important functional alterations of the edited gene products (1Bass B.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 833-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The A to I editing described for glutamate receptors, serotonin 5-HT2C receptors, and the hepatitis delta virus RNA is mediated by a family of adenosine deaminases known as adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs (3Seeburg P.H.

These enzymes function as single peptides and contain both RNA binding and deaminase activity (3Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Sprengel R. Brain Res.

The best characterized example of C to U editing occurs in the mRNA of apolipoprotein (apo) B that creates a premature stop codon and leads to the synthesis of the truncated apoB-48 (5Chen S.H.

The apoB mRNA is extensively edited in the human small intestine but remains unedited in the liver, which secretes apoB-100 containing very low density lipoproteins as precursors for the atherogenic low density lipoproteins (7Greeve J.

Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). Some animals, such as dog, horse, rat, and mouse, do edit the apoB mRNA also in the liver and consequently have very low plasma low density lipoproteins levels (7Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-D. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, editing of the apoB mRNA is a decisive genetic regulation for the formation of atherogenic lipoproteins (7Greeve J. Altkemper I. Dieterich J.-D. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The editing of apoB occurs coincident with splicing and polyadenylation of the mRNA and is mediated by the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex (9Lau P.P. Xiong W. Zhu H.-J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. J. Biol.

Two variants of ASP/ACF differing by an eight-amino acid insertion with identical activity and various other splice variants have been described that are produced by alternative splicing of the ACF/ASP pre-mRNA (24Lellek H.

In contrast to the adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs that contain the RNA-binding motifs and the catalytic domains in the same polypeptide, in C to U editing, these modular elements for an editing enzyme appear to be separated into APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF (24Lellek H.

Earlier biochemical studies already suggested that the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex may consist in high molecular weight complexes (24Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J.

Therefore, although several studies demonstrated that APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF exert strong apoB mRNA editing activity in vitro, it is unknown whether APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF are all that is required for editing of apoB mRNA in vivo. To demonstrate that APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF represent the core of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex that is fully competent to edit apoB mRNA in vivo, we set out to establish an editing system in yeast. This eukaryotic organism was chosen since it is genetically most distant to mammalians in which this type of mRNA editing has evolved (2Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 833-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Smith H.C. Gott J.M. Hanson M.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1105-1123PubMed Google Scholar). A fusion transcript of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 linked to its specific inhibitor protein Gal80 by an intervening apoB fragment was used as a selectable marker. We demonstrate that the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex is reconstituted in yeast by expression of APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF. mRNA editing introduces a stop codon in the Gal4-Gal80 fusion transcript and allows to select for expression of active Gal4 protein. This is the first example that mRNA editing is reconstituted in yeast, and the selection system presented may have broader applications for the study of other mRNA editing or processing reactions. ApoB cDNAs with a C or a T at nucleotide position 6666, respectively, were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides L/NcoI (GCCATGGATATATACAAATTGCATTAGATGATG, nucleotides 6591–6615 plus NcoI site) and L/BspH1rev (GTCATGAATCCAAGATGCAGTACT ACT TCC, nucleotides 6867–6842 plus BspH1 site), cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. The apoB cDNA was excised from the vector by NcoI/BspH1 restriction enzyme digest and cloned into the uniqueNcoI-site of construct pSB32-GAL4(1–841)-GAL80 kindly provided by Dr. Stephen A. Johnston, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. The resulting construct GAL4-ApoB-GAL80 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides Gal4-s (CAAGCTTATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATCGAAC) and Gal80-rev (GGATCCAGCAATCTCGATCGAATTAATGTCGC), cloned into pGEM T Easy, and entirely sequenced to confirm the nucleotide sequence. pAS-GAL4-ApoBC-GAL80 (pAS-Gal4C) and pAS-GAL4-ApoBU-GAL80 (pAS-Gal4U), respectively, were generated by tri-fragment ligation using (i) theHindIII-BamHI fragment of pGEMT-GAL4-ApoB-GAL80 containing the GAL4-ApoB-GAL80 construct, (ii) theHindIII-SacI fragment, and (iii) theSacI-BamHI fragment of pAS2 (CLONTECH). The correct composition of the final constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Rat Apobec-1 cDNA was excised from pSVL-Apobec-1 (32Greeve J. Jona V.K. Chowdhury N.R. Horwitz M.S. Chowdhury J.R. J.

The PGK promoter along with the full-length Apobec-1 cDNA was excised with XhoI and SalI and cloned into theSalI site of pRS317 (obtained from ATCC) to generate pLS317-Apobec-1. pACT-APOBEC-1 was constructed by tri-fragment ligation using (i) an HindIII-SacI fragment containing the open reading frame of rat APOBEC-1, (ii) theHindIII-ScaI, and (iii) theScaI-SacI fragment of pACT2 (CLONTECH). In the resulting pACT-APOBEC-1, the nuclear localization signal and the activation domain of GAL4 are deleted, and APOBEC-1 is under the control of the ADH promoter and is followed by the ADH termination signal (pACTΔAD-APOBEC-1). pACT-KSRP was constructed by cloning anEcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the full-length KSRP cDNA into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pACT-APOBEC-1, thereby replacing APOBEC-1 with KSRP. pGEM-T Easy containing the full-length cDNA of ASP with the insertion of eight amino acids (24Lellek H.

After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the ASP cDNA was excised by restriction enzyme digestion withSalI. pACT-APOBEC-1 was digested with EcoRI and treated with T4 DNA polymerase. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, it was further digested with XhoI. The full-length ASP cDNA was inserted into pACTIIΔAD by ligating the SalI-XhoI sites and the bluntedEcoRI and SacII sites, respectively. The Gal4-ApoB-Gal80 cassettes of pAS-Gal4-ApoBC-Gal80 and pAS-Gal4-ApoBU-Gal80, respectively, were excised by restriction enzyme digestion withXhoI and BamHI and inserted into theXhoI and BamHI sites of pBridge to generate pBridge-Gal4-ApoBC-Gal80 and pBridge-Gal4-ApoBU-Gal80, respectively. The full-length cDNA of ASP was excised from pGEM-T Easy with NotI and inserted into the unique NotI site of the multiple cloning site II of pBridge-Gal4-ApoBC-Gal80 to generate pBridge-GAL4-ApoBC-GAL80-ASP. The resulting construct was sequenced to confirm the correct orientation of ASP. The full-length cDNA of KSRP was excised from pGEM-T Easy by restriction enzyme digest with NotI and inserted into the unique NotI site of the multiple cloning site II of pBridge-Gal4-ApoBC-Gal80 to generate pBridge-Gal4-ApoBC-Gal80-KSRP. The yeast expression plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain CG-1945 (CLONTECH) by standard methods as described previously (33Greeve J. Lellek H. Rautenberg P. Greten H. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The genotype of CG1945 is MATa, ura3–52, his 3–200, lys2–801, ase2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, Gal4–542, Gal80–538, cyh-2, Lys2::Gal1UAS-Gal1TATA-HIS3; URA3::GAL4 17mers(X3)-CyC1TATA-lacZ.

Chem. 1998; 379: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Synthetic media lacking histidine were supplemented with 5 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) as a competitive inhibitor of the His3 protein to inhibit low levels of His3 protein expressed in a leaky manner and thus to suppress background growth. Filter assays for β-galactosidase were performed using standard methods as described (33Greeve J. Lellek H. Rautenberg P. Greten H. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from yeast by acid phenol extraction. The yeast were grown to late log phase on synthetic drop-out medium either with or without histidine in the presence of 5 mm 3-AT. The apoB cassette of the Gal4-ApoB-Gal80 transcript was amplified by RT-PCR with oligonucleotides GAL4–1 sense (CTTTCACAACCAATTGCCTCCTCTAAC) and apoB2 (CACGGATATGATA GTGCTCATCAAGAC) and analyzed for editing by primer extension assay (7Greeve J.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2001-2017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast transcription factor Gal4 is inhibited by complex formation with its specific inhibitor Gal80. A fusion protein consisting of Gal4 and Gal80 is inactive and does not promote Gal4-dependent transcription. To establish a functional assay system for apoB mRNA editing in vivo, we reasoned that this Gal4-Gal80 fusion transcript might be a useful selectable marker for mRNA editing in yeast. Therefore, we inserted 92 amino acids of the apoB sequence that encompass the editing site at C6666 in-frame between Gal4(1–841) and Gal80 to generate Gal4-apoBC-Gal80 (Gal4-C). As a positive control, we constructed Gal4-apoBU-Gal80 (Gal4-U), which contains the edited version of the apoB sequence with the premature stop codon. Gal4-C should not be able to promoteGal4-dependent transcription because of complex formation with its specific inhibitor Gal80, whereas the edited version Gal4-U that contains only a tail of 25 amino acids of apoB sequence should be active similar to wild-type Gal4 (Fig.1). Gal4-C and Gal4-U were expressed in yeast CG1945 cells using the expression plasmid pAS in the absence or presence of APOBEC-1 (Fig.2 A). The yeast strain CG1945 is commonly used for two-hybrid selection. It contains the lacZ and the HIS3 gene under the transcriptional control of Gal4. Expression of active Gal4 can be monitored by growth in the absence of histidine and by detection of β-galactosidase activity. After transformation of pAS2-Gal4-U and the empty vector pLS317, the yeast cells grew well on medium lacking tryptophan, lysine, and histidine and exhibited strong β-galactosidase activity (Fig.2 B). In contrast, yeast CG1945 cells transformed with pAS2-Gal4-C and the control vector pLS317 did not grow on medium without histidine and failed to express β-galactosidase (Fig.2 B). Even after co-transformation of pAS2-Gal4-C and pLS317-APOBEC-1, the yeast cells did not grow without histidine and did not express β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2 B). To analyze the apoB editing site, the Gal4-C and Gal4-U transcripts were amplified by RT-PCR and assayed for editing by primer extension analysis (Fig.2 C). The Gal4-U transcripts from yeast cells transformed with pAS2-Gal4-U contained, as expected, only U at apoB position 6666, and the Gal4-C transcript from yeast transformed with pAS-Gal4-C and pLS317 contained, as expected, only C at this position (Fig.2 C). The Gal4-C transcripts from yeast transformed with pAS-Gal4-C and pLS317-APOBEC-1 did not differ and also did not contain significant amounts of U residues at the editing site (Fig.2 C). These results confirmed the predictions that Gal4 is active in yeast when expressed from the edited Gal4-U since the stop codon prevents the translation of Gal80 but is inactive when expressed from Gal4-C because of complex formation with Gal80. Moreover, expression of only APOBEC-1 is not sufficient to induce mRNA editing at the apoB site of Gal4-apoBC-Gal80. We further investigated whether co-expression of APOBEC-1 with ASP (ACF) or with KSRP would lead to a functional editing enzyme complex in yeast that could induce a stop codon at the editing site of Gal4-C and thereby enable the cells to express active Gal4. For these experiments, Gal4-C and Gal4-U were inserted into the yeast expression plasmid pBridge to generate pB-Gal4-C or pB-Gal4-U, respectively. pBridge allows the expression of a second gene from the MET25 promoter, which is induced in the absence of methionine (Fig.3 A). Yeast CG1945 cells were transformed with pLS317-APOBEC-1 and pB-Gal4-U, pB-Gal4-C, pB-Gal4-C/ASP, or pB-Gal4-C/KSRP (Fig. 3 A) and were grown on medium lacking tryptophan, lysine, and methionine. The apoB cassettes of the Gal4-C or Gal4-U mRNAs from the transformed yeast cells were amplified by RT-PCR and analyzed for editing by primer extension assay (Fig. 3 B). The positive control Gal4-U contained only U, whereas Gal4-C contained only C at the editing position (Fig.3 B). Approximately 12% of the C residues in the apoB sequence of Gal4-C from yeast cells transformed with pB-Gal4-C/ASP were found to be edited and were sequenced as Us (Fig. 3 B). No Us at this position of the apoB sequence could be detected in yeast cells that were transformed with pB-Gal4-C/KSRP (Fig 3 B). These yeast cells that had been grown on medium lacking tryptophan, lysine, and methionine to select for the presence of the two plasmids and to induce expression from the MET25promoter were streaked onto nylon membranes and grown on medium lacking also histidine. As anticipated from the editing assay, only the yeast cells transformed either with the positive control Gal4-U or with Gal4-C/ASP grew on these media and exhibited activity of β-galactosidase (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, in yeast, the apoB site in Gal4-C is edited in the presence of APOBEC-1 and ASP. This mRNA editing leads to the expression of active Gal4 and thus enables the cells to grow in the absence of histidine and to express β-galactosidase. Next we studied whether additional expression of KSRP would enhance the editing efficiency achieved by APOBEC-1 and ASP alone. For this experiment, we constructed a third yeast expression plasmid, pACT, that allows the expression of ASP or KSRP separate from the expression of Gal4-C (Fig.4 A). Yeast CG1945 cells were triple-transformed with pLS317-APOBEC-1, pAS-Gal4-C, or pAS-Gal4-U and pACT-ASP, pACT-KSRP, or empty control pACT and were grown on medium lacking tryptophan, lysine, and leucine. Editing of the apoB site in Gal4-C was analyzed by primer extension assay of RT-PCR-amplified Gal4-C mRNA (Fig. 4 B). As before, the positive control pAS-Gal4-U contained only U at the editing position, whereas no U residue could be detected at this position in yeast transformed with pLS317-APOBEC-1, pAS-Gal4-C, and pACT-KSRP or the empty vector control pACT (Fig. 4 B). In yeast cells transformed with pAS-Gal4-C, pLS317-APOBEC-1, and pACT-ASP, however, ∼8% of the C residues at the apoB editing site demonstrated successful editing and were sequenced as Us in the primer extension assay (Fig. 4 B). This result proved that expression of APOBEC-1 from pLS317 and of ASP from pACT is sufficient to induce competent editing activity in yeast CG1945 cells. In the next experiment, the three presumptive components of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex were expressed in yeast CG1945 cells using the three yeast expression plasmids pB-Gal4-C, pLS317-APOBEC-1, and pACT-ASP or KSRP (Fig.5 A). The apoB cassettes were amplified by RT-PCR from yeast cells grown on medium lacking tryptophan, lysine, leucine, and methionine and were analyzed for editing by primer extension assay (Fig. 5 B). Although the positive control pBGal4-U contained only U at the editing position, no U could be detected at this position in yeast cells transformed with pLS317-APOBEC-1, with pB-Gal4-C, and with the empty control pACT or pACT-KSRP (Fig. 5 B). In yeast cells transformed with pLS317-APOBEC-1, pB-Gal4-C, and pACT-ASP, ∼13% of the C residues of the apoB site were edited and analyzed as Us in the primer extension assay (Fig. 5 B). This amount of editing was further increased to 21% in yeast cells that were transformed with pB-Gal4/ASP and pACT-KSRP (Fig. 5 B). The triple-transformed yeast cells were restreaked onto synthetic medium lacking, in addition to tryptophan, lysine, leucine, and methionine, also histidine. Only the positive control with pB-Gal4-U and the yeast cells transformed with pB-Gal4-C plus pACT-ASP or with pB-Gal4-C/ASP plus pACT-KSRP grew in the absence of histidine and demonstrated robust β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 5 C). The results of this investigation allow two important conclusions. First, it is demonstrated for the first time that coordinate expression of the catalytic subunit APOBEC-1 and the APOBEC-1-stimulating protein ASP/ACF is sufficient to create apoB mRNA editing in vivo. These two proteins therefore represent the minimal core components of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex in vivo. These experiments were performed in yeast because this is the eukaryotic organism most distant to mammalians in which this type of mRNA editing has evolved to modulate lipoprotein metabolism. The efficiency of apoB mRNA editing in yeast mediated by APOBEC-1 and ASP (ACF) is limited and can be increased by the expression of the alternative splicing factor KSRP. Second, a tripartite fusion of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 with its specific inhibitor Gal80 and a short intervening apoB sequence is demonstrated as a potent selectable marker for the functional study of mRNA editing in vivo. This approach of using the Gal4-Gal80 fusion transcript should be more widely applicable and may be useful to study other forms of mRNA editing or RNA processing as well. The system is based on the two-hybrid assay and requires only little modifications of the Gal4-Gal80 transcript depending on the special type of application. The molecular identification of ASP/ACF by Driscoll and co-workers (23Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and simultaneously by our group (24Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) immediately led to the question as to whether APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF are sufficient for apoB mRNA editing in vivo. APOBEC-1 together with ASP/ACF exert strong apoB mRNA editing activity in vitro, but this does not necessarily imply that these two proteins are all that is required for editing in vivo. This investigation was designed to address this question by reconstitution of apoB mRNA editing in yeast. We assumed that this would be the most direct approach to this issue. Even the generation of an ASP/ACF-deficient mouse model in which editing would presumably be abolished could not rule out that other proteins besides APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF are required for editing in vivo. Moreover, in our protein purification that led to the molecular cloning of ASP, the alternative splicing factor KSRP co-purified with ASP (24Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although no effect of KSRP on apoB mRNA editing could be demonstrated in vitro, we were inclined to assume that this co-purification might indicate that these two proteins do interact functionally in vivo. The main objective of our study was to demonstrate reconstitution of apoB mRNA editingin vivo that was not only detectable by analysis of the transcript per se but also exerted a physiological effect. A short apoB fragment containing the editing site was inserted in-frame between a Gal4-Gal80 fusion protein (kindly provided by Stephen A. Johnston, University of Texas, Dallas, TX) to create a selectable marker for apoB mRNA editing in yeast. Gal4 is inhibited by Gal80 when both proteins are expressed on the same polypeptide. The nuclear localization signal and the activation domain of Gal4 were deleted from the pACT expression plasmid to allow a coordinate expression of ASP. Gal4-C was a tight selectable marker that did not cause background growth of the yeast cells without editing. Even when APOBEC-1 was co-expressed, no editing of the apoB site was detectable, and Gal4 was inactive. This result is in contradiction to another study that demonstrated APOBEC-1-mediated mRNA editing in yeast without any other additional exogenous component (34Dance G.S.C. Sowden M.P. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is the level of APOBEC-1 expression. We chose the PGK promoter to avoid aberrant hyperediting by APOBEC-1 that has been demonstrated in cell culture in vitro and in transgenic animals in vivo (35Yamanaka S. Poksay K. Driscoll D.M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11506-11510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Sowden M. Hamm J.K. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3011-3017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). High level expression of APOBEC-1 by the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter and an exogenous SV40 nuclear localization signal at the amino terminus apparently increases the nuclear abundance of APOBEC-1 and leads to editing of apoB transcripts even in the absence of ASP/ACF (34Dance G.S.C. Sowden M.P. Yang Y. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was excluded in our experiments by moderate constitutive expression of APOBEC-1 mediated by the PGK promoter. In addition, the absence of editing in Gal4-C without APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF does not favor the endogenous yeast gene CDD1 as an editing enzyme as has been previously proposed (37Dance G.S.C. Beemiller P. Yang Y. Van Mater D. Mian S. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1772-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ApoB mRNA editing activity was reconstituted in yeast by the expression of APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF and induced the expression of active Gal4 due to the introduction of a stop translation codon between Gal4 and Gal80. This was shown with two different expression plasmids. These results provide proof that APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF represent the core of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex, which is missing in yeast. The extent of editing at the apoB site in Gal4-C that was achieved in yeast was limited to a maximum of 21%. This falls short from editing of apoB mRNA in the intestine where in every message C6666 is edited to U (5Chen S.H. Habib G. Yang C.Y., Gu, Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A. Silbermann S.R. Cai S.J.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1367-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several reasons may explain this limitation of editing in yeast. First, the Gal4-C transcripts contain only 276 nucleotides of apoB sequence and may not be the ideal substrate for APOBEC-1-mediated mRNA editing. Second, it may well be that the optimum activity of the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex in vivo requires additional components besides APOBEC-1 and ASP, which are missing in yeast. The co-expression of KSRP increased editing from a level of 13% achieved by APOBEC-1 and ASP alone to ∼21%. This indicates that KSRP can contribute to editing of apoB mRNA in vivo. Its precise function in the editing process, however, remains to be studied, but this was not the aim of the present investigation. Recently, three other proteins, GRY-RBP, CUGBP2, and ABBP-2, have been identified by two-hybrid selection in yeast using APOBEC-1 as the bait and have been suggested to be involved in the editing of apoB mRNA (28Blanc V.

GRY-RBP is an RNA-binding protein with ∼50% homology to ASP/ACF that itself cannot support APOBEC-1 to edit apoB mRNA in vitro but that can inhibit the in vitro editing reaction (28Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scoot J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 10272-10283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CUGBP2 is an ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that can bind to apoB mRNA and to ACF/ASP and that also has the potential to inhibit in vitro editing (29Anant S. Henderson J.O.

ABBP-2, a novel human Class II DnaJ homologue and member of the human Hsp40 family, was demonstrated not only to interact with APOBEC-1 but also to be required for editing of apoB mRNA in APOBEC-1-expressing BNLCL.2 cells (30Lau P.P.

Taken together, these results suggest that editing of every Gal4-C transcript may require more components in addition to APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF that comprise only the essential core of the editing enzyme complex. The Gal4-C reporter system will be an ideal tool to analyze the effects of GRY-RPB, CUGBP2, or ABBP-2 on the editing efficiency of APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF and may provide further proof for the necessity of any of these in the editing reaction. This study is the first to demonstrate that transcriptional regulation by Gal40-Gal80 can be used to reconstitute and select for mRNA editing in yeast. Our system is based on the two-hybrid selection assay and uses the commercially available yeast strain CG1945, which is widely used for these studies. The nuclear localization signal and the activation domain of GAL4 were deleted from the commercially available yeast expression plasmid pACT, and the Gal4-binding domain in pAS and pBridge was replaced by the Gal4-apoB-Gal80 fusion construct. The Gal4-apoB-Gal80 selection marker does not produce background growth, and the synthesis of Gal4 is entirely dependent on mRNA editing of the apoB site. We did not observe breakthrough of the selection and demonstrated that the Gal4-apoB-Gal80 transcripts were properly processed and not cleaved prematurely as an obvious alternative to activate Gal4. 2R. Kirsten, I. Diehl, and J. Greeve, unpublished observations. This system may therefore be used to further study the apoB mRNA editing enzyme complex in yeast by analyzing mutants of APOBEC-1 and ASP/ACF. Moreover, by modifying the Gal4-Gal80 reporter, this system may be adapted to investigate other mRNA processing reactions. Obvious applications include the analysis of mRNA cleavage terminating the transcript behind Gal4 and of alternative splicing that would remove Gal80. Our work therefore extends the use of the Gal4 transcription factor to the analysis of mRNA editing and processing and may be helpful to elucidate such processes. The construct pSB32-GAL4(1–841)-GAL80 was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen A. Johnston, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, and is gratefully acknowledged."

PS-I catalyzes the part of the light reactions responsible for the absorption of light energy and generating reduced ferredoxin via a series of electron carriers across the thylakoid membrane.

However, studies on the binding site for Fd, the terminal mobile electron acceptor in PS-I, have recently been possible (10Ruffle S.V. Mustafa A. Kitmitto A. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol.

In-vivo, cyanobacterial and algal PS-I can be reduced by either Pc or the alternative electron donor cytochrome c6, whereas vascular plant PS-I is reduced only by Pc. Structural insight into Pc binding in cyanobacteria has been derived from modeling studies using PS-I from the cyanobacterium S. elongatus and Pc fromEnteromorpha prolifera (a green alga) (7Fromme P. Schubert W.-D. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This study concluded that the likely Pc binding site was in an indentation on the lumenal surface of the PS-I complex. In this article we present data concerning the location of the vascular plant Pc binding site following chemical cross-linking of the native subunit to two-dimensional crystalline arrays of spinach PS-I. Thylakoid membranes were prepared from market spinach (Spinacia oleracea). A two-step incubation procedure was used to prepare PS-I crystal-containing grana membranes as previously described (2Kitmitto A. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol.

Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 36: 275-276Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and then processed using the lattice unbending procedures in the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology suite of programs (12Amos L. Henderson R. Unwin P.N.T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 39: 183-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The final data set of 450 structure factors were merged from 3209 observations extracted from 12 crystals. Structure factors were calculated using vector summation and with amplitude weighting using the program TRIMERGE (11Hovmöller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 36: 275-276Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Fourier vector difference maps were calculated using the CCP4 suite of programs (13Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The calculated projection maps of cyanobacterial PS-I and the docking models were generated using SPIDER (14Frank J. Shimkin B. Dowse H. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 343-358Crossref Google Scholar) from the protein data bank coordinates of the relevant proteins and protein complexes. Three-dimensional coulomb density maps were calculated from the coordinates, and a voxel size of 3 Å was applied with e.g.64 × 64 × 64 voxels for a PS-I monomer. The resolution of the map was then curtailed to 25 Å using a three-dimensional Fourier low-pass filter. Sections (slices) through the density map were taken parallel to the putative membrane plane, and lumenal and stromal slices were identified. Stromal and lumenal projection maps were then calculated by averaging the lumenal or stromal slices. Finally, to allow comparison with the experimental data with the P22121 unit cell, the stromal map was flipped, simulating the screw axis. Chemical cross-linking between PS-I from crystals and spinach Pc was essentially an adaptation of the method described by Lelong et al. (15Lelong C. Sétif P. Lagoutte B. Bottin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10034-10039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pc, (a kind gift of Dr. K. Oleson, Goteborg University, Goteborg, Sweden) was cross-linked to PS-I crystal-containing samples at 4 mg/ml chlorophyll by incubating for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μm Pc, 2 mm N-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, 2 mmsulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide in 20 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2. The cross-linking was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 0.2m ammonium acetate. The crystals were then washed twice with 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, and then resuspended in 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 20% v/v glycerol before storage at −80 °C. Samples were mounted for electron microscopy at a chlorophyll concentration of 30–60 μg ml−1. Functional Pc binding was detected using an assay that monitors P700+ reduction. A cross-linked sample at 50 μg of chlorophyll ml−1 in MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5, and 30 mm MgCl2 was placed in two balanced cuvettes, and 0.1 mm ascorbate was added. Cuvettes were placed in an Aminco DW2 spectrophotometer fitted for side illumination. One cuvette was illuminated by non-saturating red light (Schott RG665 filter),and absorbance changes at 430 nm (5-nm slit width) were recorded. Excess Pc was then added (70 μm), and the light-induced absorbance changes were recorded as before. The extent of P700+formation depends on the reduction rate (which varies with Pc presence) relative to the rate of light-induced oxidation (which is fixed by the light source). Cross-linking of Pc to PS-I was checked by monitoring the levels of free Pc in the supernatant after centrifugation of the cross-linker-treated membranes. This showed cross-linking of Pc over the 0–20 μm range, with little additional cross-linking above 20 μm Pc (data not shown). Whether the cross-linked Pc was functionally bound to PS-I was established by monitoring the rate of re-reduction of P700+in the presence of cross-linked Pc and comparing those rates with maximal rates achieved after the addition of excess free Pc (Fig.1). The data showed that functional binding of Pc occurs in the micromolar range, and saturation seems to occur at concentrations >25 μm with an apparentK d in the region of 10 μm. These levels are consistent with reported binding in this range (16Wynn R.M. Malkin R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5863-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At least 80% of the binding sites appear to be available for functional Pc cross-linking. Electron microscopy of Pc-cross-linked thylakoids containing ordered arrays of PS-I revealed that the treatment did not alter the unit cell parameters of the crystals (TableI). Moreover the different crystals were sufficiently well ordered as judged by low inter-image phase residuals (Table I) to permit a Fourier difference analysis to be carried out. Fig. 2 shows the projection maps of control (Fig. 2 a) and Pc cross-linked (Fig.2 b) PS-I crystals showing four complete PS-I complexes in the unit cell. As frequently encountered for negatively stained crystals, there was differential staining of the two sides of the crystal (2Kitmitto A. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19497-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Harris J.R. Holzenburg A. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because two PS-I complexes are oriented “up” and two are oriented “down” in the p22121 unit cell, and because stain associates preferentially with the side of the crystal in contact with the specimen support film, then the up complexes give rise to a distinctively different appearance in projection from the down complexes. This has the advantage that lumenal and stromal surfaces of the PS-I complex are readily differentiated, with the stromal surface represented top right and bottom left in the map, while the lumenal surface is bottom left and top right (Fig. 2, a andb). Cross-linking with Pc (Fig. 2 b) results in increased density on the lumenal side of the complex in a central position. The binding also results in an extension of the differential staining effect with the lumenal surface deviating more greatly from the stromal surface in its overall shape and appearance. Fourier difference analysis results in a difference map (Fig. 2 c) that shows a very strong peak centered on the lumenal surface. A much weaker difference peak at the edge of the stromal PS-I surface is also present but is of less significance. This is partly because of its weaker character but also because of its presence at the periphery of the stromal surface, where small differences due to stain penetration may be exaggerated.Table ICrystallographic and image processing data for the PS-I-untreated and PS-I-PC-cross-linked two-dimensional projection mapPS-I untreatedPS-I PC cross-linkedNumber of processed images1212Unit cell dimensions: a (nm)26.4 ± 0.926.7 ± 0.5 b (nm)27.6 ± 0.727.8 ± 0.7 γ (°)9090Two-dimensional space group p22121 p22121Average inter-image phase residual (°)24.725.3No. of structure factors467450No. of observations28623209Approximate resolution limit (nm)1.81.8a:b axis ratio0.960.96 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Contoured projection maps of the unit cells in the PS-I two-dimensional crystals in the plane group P22121.

Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar) (Protein data bank ID1JB0). A comparison of the structures of the plant and cyanobacterial PS-I reaction centers at low (∼25 Å) resolution has therefore become possible for the first time. Fig. 3compares the lumenal (I) and stromal (II) surfaces of plant PS-I with corresponding surfaces of cyanobacterial PS-I (III, IV, respectively). A very strong resemblance is noticeable between the lumenal surfaces of the plant (I) and cyanobacterial (III) complexes. Densities due to the subunits PsaF/J and PsaL are readily identifiable. Of interest is the more protruding PsaL density in the cyanobacterial structure. This subunit has been associated with trimer production in cyanobacterial preparations (18Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), while trimers have not been observed with plant material. The location of the main peak in the Fourier difference map shown in Fig. 2 c is superimposed on the plant lumenal surface (thick contour, I), indicating that Pc binding occurs at a roughly central location equidistant between the PsaA and B subunits and with a slight bias toward the PsaL side. In both complexes, the putative binding site sits over a shallow depression. The stromal surfaces of cyanobacterial (IV) and plant (II) PS-I complexes are also similar in overall shape. Again, the PsaL subunit protrudes more from the cyanobacterial complex. The stromal ridge, identified as the location of the PsaC, D, and E subunits in cyanobacterial PS-I is prominent in both structures, although the plant stromal ridge is broader with additional density close to PsaL. It is feasible that this extra stromal density could represent the plant-specific PsaH subunit, which has been associated with the PsaL subunit (19Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Naver H. Haldrup A. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10784-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as well as with the docking of LHCII during state transitions (21Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The thick contour shows the position of the main peak in the Fourier difference analysis of Fd cross-linked PS-I crystals. The peak lies over the stromal ridge, with a bias toward the PsaE-end of the ridge. A thin ridge of density on the stromal surface is detected in both low resolution maps, (asterisk,II and IV). Examination of the cyanobacterial structure shows that this feature is partly formed by N-terminal residues 14–40 of the PsaA subunit (see “Discussion”). Modeling of reduced Pc (from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942) at the lumenal surface of PS-I was performed using x-ray crystallographic structures of the cyanobacterial PS-I complex (8Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar) and Pc (Protein data bank ID 1BXV) (22Inoue T. Sugawara H. Hamanaka S. Tsukui H. Suzuki E. Kohzuma T. Kai T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6063-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar studies were carried out for Fd binding on the stromal PS-I surface. Modeling was performed with the aim of optimizing for four constraints: a) compatibility with the position and shape of the difference peaks in the low resolution electron crystallography maps of plant PS-I, b) avoidance of steric clashes between docking partners, c) minimization of distances for electron transfer, and d) fine tuning to include any positional data from cross-linking and to avoid of any obvious unfavorable conformations such as mismatching of hydrophobic and polar regions and close proximity of similarly charged residues. The models were then assessed by generating stromal and lumenal surfaces at low resolution that could be directly compared with the results obtained for Pc and Fd cross-linked PS-I complexes. Fig.4 shows a model with both Pc and Fd bound to the PS-I complex, and Fig. 5 compares the surfaces generated from models with the low resolution plant PS-I data.Figure 5Comparison of photosystem I projection maps:I, the Pc-cross-linked PS-I lumenal projection with (III) a calculated projection map for the lumenal side of the cyanobacterial complex after docking of Pc as in Fig. 4. Similarly, the plant stromal projection after Fd-cross-linking (II) is compared with a calculated map for the stromal side of the cyanobacterial complex after docking Fd. As in Fig. 3, resolution has been curtailed at 25 Å. The lumenal map represents the outer 20 Å of the lumenal side and is unflipped. The stromal map represents the outer 48 Å of the stromal side and is flipped.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pc docking was assisted by the elongated shape of the molecule. It was clear that the end-on docking of a single Pc molecule as shown in Fig.4 was compatible with the electron crystallography data (see Fig. 5,I and III). In contrast, a side-on docking produced an elongated density on the lumenal surface, which was quite different from the shape of the density observed in the plant studies. Distances between the copper atom of Pc and P700 were also optimized in the end-on configuration with typical distance of 15 Å from the copper atom to the edges of the chlorophyll tetrapyrrole rings. The additional density due to Pc in the model drastically alters the profile of the simulated lumenal surface of PS-I (Fig. 5, III), with weaker features becoming camouflaged by the intense Pc peak. A similar effect is observed for the experimental data (Fig. 5, I),e.g. the weak PsaL density disappears in both maps. As in Fig. 3, the lumenal surface for the experimentally derived plant PS-I-Pc map corresponds quite closely to the simulation with cyanobacterial PS-I-Pc. The docking of oxidized Fd (23Morales R. Chron M.-H. Hudry-Clergeon G Petillot Y. Norager S. Medina M. Frey M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15764-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Anabaena sp. PCC 7119) to cyanobacterial PS-I was carried out using the same criteria as above. The more spherical shape of the Fd molecule does not allow the discrimination of alternative orientations on the basis of the low resolution difference map; however the off-center location of the iron-sulfur center in Fd does allow for some discrimination on the basis of minimization of electron transfer distance, and details of cross-linking of PsaD to Fd allowed some further constraints (see below). In the model shown in Fig. 4, the distance between the nearest 4Fe4S center of PsaC (i.e. FB) and the 2Fe2S center of Fd is about 18 Å. Docking Fd directly on top of the stromal ridge as shown in Fig. 4 extends the height of the ridge to about 6 nm, giving a large peak in the simulated stromal surface (cf. Fig. 5, IV with Fig. 3, IV). The experimental data for Fd-cross-linked plant PS-I also shows a large peak on the stromal ridge with a slight bias toward the PsaE subunit. The data shown in this paper, when compared with the recently released coordinates for the cyanobacterial PS-I reaction center (8Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar), demonstrate that cyanobacterial and plant PS-I reaction center complexes are very similar in shape and dimensions at ∼25 Å resolution. Only minor differences are observed such as the slightly different protrusion of the PsaL subunit from the main body of the complex and the small additional domain in the plant stromal ridge. A conclusion that follows from this close similarity is that there is no significant density in the maps of the plant PS-I crystals for the peripheral light harvesting antenna (LHCI) proteins of PS-I. The location of these plant-specific proteins therefore remains unresolved. This is an interesting but somewhat perplexing outcome because the LHCI polypeptides are estimated to be present with a stoichiometry of about eight proteins per PS-I complex (19Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) in plant chloroplasts. Given the approximate mass of a single LHCI protein plus pigments (∼30–40 kDa), a complement of eight LHCI proteins should represent the major proportion of the density in the unit cell, and the presence of even one LHCI protein ought to be detectable at 25 Å resolution. It could be argued that connections between LHCI and PS-I are weak because they are apparently disrupted by the crystallization process employed here, which includes a mild detergent treatment; but this is hard to reconcile with the observation of detergent-solubilized particles (19Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) where LHCI and PS-I co-purify. Cross-linking studies of detergent-solubilized and purified spinach PS-I/LHCI (19Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) demonstrated considerable cross-linkage between the four LHCI polypeptides but did not detect extensive association of LHCI with PS-I core polypeptides except PsaK and possibly PsaG. Thus there is still much to be understood about the association of PS-I with its light-harvesting antennae proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that a hydrophobic patch containing Leu, Gly, and Ala on Pc is crucial for binding and electron transfer to PS-I. This patch is close to the copper atom binding site in Pc (24De la Cerda B. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10125-10130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Surface-charged residues in Pc and PsaF have also been implicated in docking of Pc in plants, in particular acidic Glu and Asp residues on Pc and Lys and Arg residues on the N-terminal region of PsaF (25Olesen K. Ejdebäck M. Crnogorac M.M. Kosti N.M. Hansson Ö. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16695-16705Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26De la Cerda B. Diaz-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervas M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4180-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This electrostatic interaction may be required for initial attraction to and/or stabilization of Pc on the lumenal surface of PS-I rather than in a lock-and-key type of docking. The oxidation kinetics of Pc have been measured under many conditions, with electron transfer usually at least biphasic in plants. A fast phase of around 10–20 μs and a slower phase of around 200 μs have been observed (29Mamedov M.D. Mamedova A.A. Chamorovsky S.K. Semenov A.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Hippler M. Riedel A. Schroer U. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The fast electron transfer step has been associated with tightly bound Pc, while the slower phase may be due to loosely associated Pc or due to inter-Pc transfer (29Mamedov M.D. Mamedova A.A. Chamorovsky S.K. Semenov A.Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Hippler M. Riedel A. Schroer U. Nitschke W. Haehnel W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 31Medina M. Diaz A. Hervas M. Navarro J.A. Gomezmoreno C. Delarosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Bottin H. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6453-6460Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we find evidence for a single Pc molecule bound to PS-I, which is presumably the Pc associated with the fast electron transfer event. The distance (∼15 Å) between the copper atom of Pc and the edges of the special pair (P700) of PS-I in the model is consistent with the fast electron transfer. The modeled Pc is close (18 Å) to the N terminus of the cyanobacterial PsaF subunit. Higher plant PsaF, which has an N-terminal extension that has been implicated in Pc binding should be able to interact more intimately with plant Pc (28Hippler M Drepper F Rochaix J.-D. Mühlenhoff U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4180-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At the bottom and center of the shallow lumenal depression is the psuedo-2-fold symmetry axis of the heterodimeric reaction center. Two surface helices provided by the PsaA and B subunits are related by the pseudo-symmetry, and they are situated between the special pair of chlorophylls (P700) and the lumenal surface in contact with the aqueous phase. Mutation of these helices is known to affect electron transfer (33Sun J., Xu, W. Hervás M. Navarro J.A., De la Rosa M.A. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19048-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two highly conserved tryptophan residues exactly straddle the 2-fold axis with their aromatic rings facing into the aqueous medium. In the model these are in close proximity to the hydrophobic patch on the surface of Pc. The modeled Fd is close to PsaC and PsaE subunits and on top of the stromal ridge. The docking configuration also allows contact between PsaD and Fd via a long C-terminal arm (residues 100–138 in S. elongatus) that winds over and around the PsaC subunit. The interaction of Fd with PS-I has been studied by cross-linking, and PsaD has been identified as being of crucial importance in Fd binding (19Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,34Lagoutte B. Hanley J. Bottin H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Bottin H. Hanley J. Lagoutte B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 287: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Zanetti G. Merati G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Zilber A.L. Malkin R. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 have shown that Lys-106 on PsaD can be cross-linked to Glu-93 on Fd (19Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the S. elongatus PS-I structure, the equivalent Lys-104 of PsaD extends from the top of the stromal ridge. A lysine residue, Lys-34 in PsaC, has been identified as strongly influencing Fd binding and electron transfer. This residue also lies toward the top of the stromal ridge. The location of Fd as discussed in this paper is different from the location identified in studies of cyanobacterial PS-I using electron microscopy and single particle analysis (38Lelong C. Boekema E. Kruip J. Bottin H. Rogner M. Setif P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2160-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the latter studies, a location off to the side of the stromal ridge was suggested with contact to PsaC, D, and E subunits as well as with the stromal surface of the PsaA subunit. A small density (marked with anasterisk in Fig. 3, II and IV), which is formed by the N-terminal residues 14–40 of PsaA, would be predicted to be involved in such contacts. Two positively charged arginine residues (Arg-40 and Arg-36) project upwards from this region and hence could provide some electrostatic interactions with Fd. The kinetics of Fd reduction are complex, with phases in the 0.5–100 μs range (39Setif P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These studies place broad limits on the likely electron transfer distance between the iron-sulfur center of PsaC and Fd and could be taken as indicating that alternative docking configurations might exist as discussed in a recent review (39Setif P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the model shown in this report, a distance of about 18 Å for electron transfer is implied, which is slightly longer than the distance (14 Å) reported for a location to the side of the stromal ridge (7Fromme P. Schubert W.-D. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In conclusion, information on the binding of mobile water-soluble electron carriers to PS-I has been obtained in low resolution electron crystallographic studies. These data allow the positioning of Pc and Fd with reasonable accuracy, and when combined with high resolution data for cyanobacterial PS-I, as well as cross-linking and mutagenesis data, they now form the basis for the generation of testable models of functional PS-I-Pc and PS-I-Fd complexes. These models should be refined using molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimization and tested using site-directed mutagenesis. We thank Dr. R. F. Collins and Dr. M. F. Rosenberg for useful discussions."
