https://openalex.org/W1982159046,"Nutrient-sensitive pathways regulate both O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), cooperatively connecting metabolic homeostasis to regulation of numerous intracellular processes essential for life. Similar to phosphorylation, catalyzed by kinases such as AMPK, O-GlcNAcylation is a highly dynamic Ser/Thr-specific post-translational modification of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial proteins catalyzed exclusively by OGT. OGT and AMPK target a multitude of intracellular proteins, with the net effect to protect cells from the damaging effects of metabolic stress. Despite hundreds of studies demonstrating significant overlap in upstream and downstream signaling processes, no study has investigated if OGT and AMPK can directly regulate each other. We show acute activation of AMPK alters the substrate selectivity of OGT in several cell lines and nuclear localization of OGT in C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes. Nuclear localization of OGT affects O-GlcNAcylation of numerous nuclear proteins and acetylation of Lys-9 on histone 3 in myotubes. AMPK phosphorylates Thr-444 on OGT in vitro; phosphorylation of Thr-444 is tightly associated with AMPK activity and nuclear localization of OGT in myotubes, and phospho-mimetic T444E-OGT exhibits altered substrate selectivity. Conversely, the α- and γ-subunits of AMPK are O-GlcNAcylated, O-GlcNAcylation of the γ1-subunit increases with AMPK activity, and acute inhibition of O-GlcNAc cycling disrupts activation of AMPK. We have demonstrated significant cross-talk between the O-GlcNAc and AMPK systems, suggesting OGT and AMPK may cooperatively regulate nutrient-sensitive intracellular processes that mediate cellular metabolism, growth, proliferation, and/or tissue function."
https://openalex.org/W2154612703,"Disintegration of the colonic epithelial barrier is considered a key event in the initiation and progression of inflammatory bowel and celiac disease. As the primary etiology of these diseases remains unknown, we hypothesized that the trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON), a fungal metabolite found in grain-based human diets, might be one of the triggers resulting in an impairment of the intestinal tight junction network preceding an inflammatory response. Using horizontal impedance measurements, we demonstrate that DON disintegrates a human Caco-2 cell monolayer within <1 h after exposure to concentrations as low as 1.39 μM. This initial trigger is followed by a decrease in transepithelial resistance and an increased permeability of marker molecules, such as lucifer yellow and FITC-labeled dextran. In parallel, the increase in paracellular transport of FITC-dextran is demonstrated in vivo in B6C3F1 mice, challenged orally with DON. In vitro claudin protein levels are decreased and correlated with a displacement within the cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by a compensatory up-regulation of mRNA levels of claudins and their binding partner ZO-1. In treated mice, alterations in villus architecture in the entire intestinal tract resemble the disintegration of the epithelial barrier, a characteristic of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.—Akbari, P., Braber, S., Gremmels, H., Koelink, P.

Recent findings indicate that the BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family play an essential role in various cell death paradigms, including neurodegeneration. Here we report that Puma (p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), an important member of the BH3-only protein family, is up-regulated in neurons upon toxic β-amyloid 1–42 (Aβ(1–42)) exposure both in vitro and in vivo. Down-regulation of Puma by specific siRNA provides significant protection against neuron death induced by Aβ(1–42). We further demonstrate that the activation of p53 and inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathways induce Puma. The transcription factor FoxO3a, which is activated when PI3K/Akt signaling is inhibited, directly binds with the Puma gene and induces its expression upon exposure of neurons to oligomeric Aβ(1–42). Moreover, Puma cooperates with another BH3-only protein, Bim, which is already implicated in AD. Our results thus suggest that Puma is activated by both p53 and PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathways and cooperates with Bim to induce neuron death in response to Aβ(1–42).

https://openalex.org/W1990459021,"The ceramide transport protein CERT mediates the inter-organelle transport of ceramide for the synthesis of sphingomyelin, presumably through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi membrane contact sites. CERT has a short peptide motif named FFAT, which associates with the ER-resident membrane protein VAP. We show that the phosphorylation of CERT at serine 315, which is adjacent to the FFAT motif, markedly enhanced the interaction of CERT with VAP. The phosphomimetic CERT S315E mutant exhibited higher activity to support the ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide than the wild-type control in a semi-intact cell system, and this enhanced activity was abrogated when its FFAT motif was deleted. The level of phosphorylation of CERT at Ser-315 increased in HeLa cells treated with a sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor or exogenous sphingomyelinase. Expression of CERT S315E induced intracellular punctate structures, to which CERT and VAP were co-localized, and the occurrence of the structure was dependent on both phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate binding and VAP binding activities of CERT. Phosphorylation of another region (named a serine-rich motif) in CERT is known to down-regulate the activity of CERT. Analysis of various CERT mutant constructs showed that the de-phosphorylation of the serine-rich motif and the phosphorylation of Ser-315 likely have the additive contribution to enhance the activity of CERT. These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of CERT at the FFAT motif-adjacent serine affected its affinity for VAP, which may regulate the inter-organelle trafficking of ceramide in response to the perturbation of cellular sphingomyelin and/or other sphingolipids.

To obtain stable transformants, pcDNAneo/nHA-hCERT WT constructs were digested with PvuI, and the linearized plasmid was transfected into HeLa-S3 cells. Cells were then cultured in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Cells were transfected with siRNA with Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed with a modified method as described previously (13.Kawano M. Kumagai K. Nishijima M. Hanada K. Efficient trafficking of ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus requires a VAMP-associated protein-interacting FFAT motif of CERT.J. Biol.

Briefly, cells cultured in 100-mm diameter dishes were transiently co-transfected with pcDNAneo/nHA-hCERT and pcDNAhyg/nFL-hVAP-A by using Lipofectamine® and PlusTM reagent. After incubation for 24 h, the subconfluent cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm disodium-β-glycerophosphate, a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 tablet/50 ml), 1% phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2, and 1% phosphatase inhibitor mixture 3). CHO-K1 cells were incubated on ice for 45 min in 120 μl of 0.5% digitonin/buffer A, or HeLa-S3 cells were incubated for 20 min in 420 μl of 1.0% Triton X-100/buffer A. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody-coupled agarose or anti-HA antibody-coupled agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The resin was precipitated by centrifugation at 1000 × g, rinsed three times with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm disodium-β-glycerophosphate, a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 tablet/50 ml), with 0.01% digitonin) (for CHO-K1 cells) or buffer A with 0.1% Triton X-100 (for HeLa-S3 cells). The resin was incubated in 50 μl of 1× NuPAGE® lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 70 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, the supernatant was subjected to Western blotting as the immunoprecipitated fraction. Proteins dissolved in NuPAGE® lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (1×) with 50 mm dithiothreitol were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with various primary antibodies diluted in 1% nonfat milk in 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (TBS). To detect the phosphorylation of Ser-315, the membrane was incubated with the purified anti-Ser(P)-315 antibody diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1% Tween 20/TBS in the presence of 100 nm nonphosphopeptide (CEEGPNSLINEE). When using a crude antiserum against Ser(P)-315, a higher concentration (5 μm) of the nonphosphopeptide was added. After incubation with secondary antibodies in 3% BSA in 0.1% Tween 20/TBS, the membrane was subjected to Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to x-ray films or imaged by LAS-1000 plus (GE Healthcare). The assay was performed as described previously (9.Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M.

Briefly, perforated LY-A cells, in which [3H]ceramide was pre-formed in the ER by metabolic labeling with [3H]sphingosine at 15 °C, were chased in the presence of the cytosol fraction of LY-A cells, an ATP-regenerating system, and purified CERT at 37 °C, and [3H]SM formed was determined as the measure of the activity. A cell-free assay of the intermembrane transfer of ceramide was performed with modifications according to a previously reported method (9.Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M.

Briefly, donor and acceptor liposomes composed of POPC/POPE/dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-lactosyl (ammonium salt)/[14C]ceramide (55 mCi/mmol) (64:16:40:1, mol/mol) and POPC/POPE (4:1, mol/mol), respectively, were formed in buffer C (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) by probe-type sonication. The acceptor liposomes were pre-centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was used for the assay. Donor liposomes (60.5 nmol/20 μl/assay), acceptor liposomes (400 nmol/60 μl/assay), and purified recombinant CERT (2 pmol) were incubated in 100 μl of buffer C at 37 °C for 10 min. After the addition of 30 μl of 1.25 mg/ml of RCA 120 to the reaction mixture, the resultant mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min to aggregate donor liposomes, and it was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The radioactivity of the supernatant was determined as a measure of the ceramide transferred to acceptor liposomes. PtdIns(4)P binding activity was assayed by a modification of the previously reported method (14.Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K.

Purified CERT was pre-centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C on the day of the assay, and the supernatant was used for the assay. Liposomes composed of POPC/POPE/lactosylceramide (16:4:6, mol/mol) with various amounts of PtdIns(4)P were formed in buffer C by probe-type sonication. Purified CERT (200 fmol) was incubated with the liposomes (26 nmol/20 μl/assay) in 50 μl of binding buffer (buffer C containing 0.3 mg/ml BSA and 0.1% CHAPS) at 4 °C for 30 min. After the addition of 15 μl of 1.25 mg/ml RCA 120, the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min to aggregate liposomes. Liposomes were then precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The amount of CERT in the supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by Western blotting with the HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody, and the ratio of the precipitated to the total (pellet/(pellet + supernatant)) was calculated. Manipulations were done at room temperature unless otherwise noted. HeLa-S3 cells were grown on coverslips at 37 °C, fixed in Mildform® 10N (4% formaldehyde in PBS) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) for 15 min, and incubated with 0.1 m NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min and blocked with 3% BSA/PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS (1:250) for 2 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 0.1% BSA/PBS (1:400) for 2 h. After two washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on FluoromountTM (Diagnostic BioSystems), and images were captured using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Axiovert 200 M; Carl Zeiss) equipped with an LSM 510 system (Carl Zeiss) using both 488- and 543-nm excitations and a C-Apochromat 63×/1.2-watt Corr water-immersion objective lens.

https://openalex.org/W1989150533,"Recent work on α-synuclein has shown that aggregation is controlled kinetically by the rate of reconfiguration of the unstructured chain, such that the faster the reconfiguration, the slower the aggregation. In this work we investigate this relationship by examining α-synuclein in the presence of a small molecular tweezer, CLR01, which binds selectively to Lys side chains. We find strong binding to multiple Lys within the chain as measured by fluorescence and mass-spectrometry and a linear increase in the reconfiguration rate with concentration of the inhibitor. Top-down mass-spectrometric analysis shows that the main binding of CLR01 to α-synuclein occurs at the N-terminal Lys-10/Lys-12. Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) analysis shows that under the conditions used for the fluorescence analysis, α-synuclein is predominantly monomeric. The results can be successfully modeled using a kinetic scheme in which two aggregation-prone monomers can form an encounter complex that leads to further oligomerization but can also dissociate back to monomers if the reconfiguration rate is sufficiently high. Taken together, the data provide important insights into the preferred binding site of CLR01 on α-synuclein and the mechanism by which the molecular tweezer prevents self-assembly into neurotoxic aggregates by α-synuclein and presumably other amyloidogenic proteins.

The protein α-synuclein is highly aggregation-prone and is involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, the best known of which is Parkinson disease (PD). 3The abbreviations used are: PDParkinson diseaseTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineESIelectrospray ionizationFT-ICRFourier transform ion-cyclotron resonanceECDelectron-capture dissociationESI-MSelectrospray-ionization mass-spectrometry. The 140-residue protein, whose function is still unknown, has no stable structure in vitro, but can adopt an α-helical structure in association with membranes and possibly exists as a helical tetramer in vivo (1.Bartels T.

However, all evidence indicates that the aggregation pathway passes through an at least partially unstructured state. Thus, much work has focused on which subset of the conformation ensemble is prone to nucleating aggregation (3.Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M.

Parkinson disease tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance electron-capture dissociation electrospray-ionization mass-spectrometry. Ahmad et al. recently have shown that aggregation of α-synuclein may be determined not by formation of certain structures but rather, by the reconfiguration of the entire unfolded ensemble (7.Ahmad B. Chen Y. Lapidus L.J. Aggregation of α-synuclein is kinetically controlled by intramolecular diffusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 2336-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When reconfiguration is fast relative to intermolecular collision, as is the situation at low temperature, then during an encounter between two proteins, each chain reconfigures too rapidly to make stabilizing intermolecular interactions. In contrast, if reconfiguration occurs at about the same rate as bimolecular association, which is the case at physiological temperatures, then aggregation is more likely to occur. Thus, a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent PD is to use small molecules that bind to α-synuclein and increase its reconfiguration rate under physiological conditions, thereby preventing aggregation. This strategy was demonstrated with curcumin, a naturally occurring compound in the spice turmeric, which was found to bind strongly to α-synuclein, prevent fibrilization, and increase the rate of protein reconfiguration at physiological temperatures (8.Ahmad B. Lapidus L.J. Curcumin Prevents Aggregation in α-Synuclein by Increasing Reconfiguration Rate.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9193-9199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it is still not known where on α-synuclein curcumin binds and whether there are multiple binding sites, though the observation that the reconfiguration rate increased at molar ratios greater than 1:1 suggests that multiple curcumin molecules bind each α-synuclein monomer. In this work, we show that the molecular tweezer, CLR01, known to bind predominantly to Lys side chains, behaves similarly to curcumin in increasing protein reconfiguration and preventing fibrilization, but binds more strongly than curcumin. Similarly to curcumin, CLR01 binds at multiple sites, yet the predominant binding site is located at the N terminus as identified by mass spectrometry. Fluorescence changes show that increasing CLR01 concentration slows down the early oligomerization process. These results suggest that reversing the net charge on certain residues from positive to negative modulates intramolecular interactions in a manner that prevents collapse and speeds up reconfiguration. The data also suggest a possible roadmap for therapeutic development. For mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, recombinant α-synuclein was purchased from rPeptide (Bogart, GA). The protein was dissolved in distilled water and desalted by using 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, Billerica, MA) with 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. The final protein concentration was 10 μm. For PICUP experiments, recombinant WT α-synuclein was produced using cDNA in which the original TAC codon for Tyr was mutated to TAT to avoid erroneous translation to Cys (9.Masuda M. Dohmae N. Nonaka T. Oikawa T. Hisanaga S. Goedert M. Hasegawa M. Cysteine misincorporation in bacterially expressed human α-synuclein.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Competent BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli bacteria were transformed with this plasmid, allowed to grow in 3 liters of Luria broth to A600 ≈ 0.6, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and collected after 3 additional hours of incubation. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 4,690 × g and resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bacteria then were lysed on ice using a tip sonicator set to 3 KJoule for 3 × 2 min cycles of 3 s power on and 3 s power off. The lysate was centrifuged at 31,920 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was collected and supplemented slowly with 10 mg/ml streptomycin. The solution then was stirred on ice for 45 min and centrifuged again at 31,920 × g for 30 min. The proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by addition of 0.23 g/ml ammonium sulfate. The solution was stirred on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 31,920 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the protein pellet was dried by inverting the centrifuge tube on paper towels. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and the resulting solution dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of the same buffer. The crude protein mixture was fractionated using ion-exchange Q columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and a 100-ml gradient ranging from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The fraction collected between 0.17 and 0.39 m NaCl was purified further by size-exclusion chromatography using a 2.15 × 600 mm TSK-gel G3000SW column (Tosoh Biosciences, San Francisco, CA) with elution buffer comprising 100 mm sodium sulfate, 25 mm sodium phosphate, and 1 mm sodium azide, pH 6.5. Finally, the fractions containing purified α-synuclein were dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl. The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and the final concentration of purified α-synuclein was 0.42 mm. α-[Cys69, Trp94]synuclein for Trp-Cys quenching experiments and fluorescence binding studies was expressed similarly in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with a T7-7 vector containing the cognate gene for expression of α-synuclein with the appropriate mutations. After cell lysis, the cell suspension was boiled for 20 min and centrifuged at 4,724 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the protein was precipitated by addition of 0.36 g/ml ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, chromatographed on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1,000 mm). α-Synuclein-containing fractions were pooled and further purified by gel filtration on a Hi-Prep Sephacryl S200 column. α-Synuclein eluted as a single peak and was found to be >95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficient of 11,460 m−1 cm−1. The stock solution of ∼0.3 mm was stored at −80 °C in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, in the presence of 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to prevent disulfide bond formation. Trp and CLR01 fluorescence measurements were carried out on a PTI QW4 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder and stirrer kit. For binding, the Trp fluorescence spectra were all measured at room temperature in a 1-cm path length cuvette exposed to 1.25-mm slit widths. Trp-94 in the mutant α-synuclein was excited at 280 nm and binding of CLR01 was measured by monitoring the change in the intrinsic fluorescence between 300 and 450 nm. The α-synuclein concentration was kept fixed at 3 μm, and CLR01 was added to the protein with increasing concentrations, ranging from 0.02 to 25.6 μm. Increase of fluorescence as well as spectral blue shifts were observed with increasing CLR01 concentration, from which the binding constant was determined. It was not possible to use higher CLR01 concentrations because the compound has significant fluorescence in the 300–450 nm range. CLR01 fluorescence was excited at 285 nm, and fluorescence measured between 300–450 nm. The CLR01 concentration was kept constant at 15 μm, and wild-type α-synuclein was added in increasing concentrations, ranging from 1–100 μm. To measure early oligomerization, 45-μm α-[Cys69, Trp94]synuclein were incubated at 37 °C with constant stirring in the cuvette holder of the fluorometer. The protein was excited at 280 nm, and emission was measured between 300–450 nm with 1-mm excitation slit width. Data were collected every ∼10 min with the excitation light blocked between measurements to minimize photobleaching. 15 mm TCEP were added to the cuvette to prevent disulfide formation during the experiment. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were acquired using a solariX hybrid 15-Tesla Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass-spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) in positive-ion mode. The estimated resolving power was 400,000 at m/z 400. A nanoESI source using borosilicate glass capillaries with Au/Pd coatings (Proxeon Biosystems/Thermo Scientific) was operated at low analyte flow conditions (100–200 nL/min) supported by a syringe pump. The ESI voltage used was 1,100–1,300 V. The capillary inlet temperature was set to 160 °C, and the skimmer voltage was set to 30–60 V. For top-down MS/MS experiments of the intact protein, precursor ions were first isolated in the quadrupole region and then transferred to the ICR cell where the protein ions interact with low energy electrons (1.1 eV, 1 ms pulse duration) to perform electron-capture dissociation (ECD). MS/MS product ions were identified against the protein sequence using tools provided by ProteinProspector. For these experiments, 300-μl aliquots of 300 μm protein were diluted 10-fold in 100-mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10-mm TCEP, and 0, 10, 20, or 30% sucrose (w/w) to change the solution's viscosity, along with the desired concentration of CLR01, making the final concentration of the protein 30 μm. The solution was stirred continuously during measurements. CLR01 concentrations used were 15, 30, or 60 μm. The solution without the protein was bubbled with N2O for 1 h, to eliminate oxygen and scavenge solvated electrons created in the UV laser pulse. Triplet lifetime decay kinetics of Trp as a result of Cys quenching was measured using an instrument described previously (10.Singh V.R. Kopka M. Chen Y. Wedemeyer W.J. Lapidus L.J. Dynamic Similarity of the Unfolded States of Proteins L and G.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10046-10054Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Trp triplet was excited by a 10-ns laser pulse at 289 nm created from the fourth harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser (Continuum) and a 1-meter Raman cell filled with 450 p.s.i of D2 gas. The triplet population was probed at 441 nm by a HeCd laser (Kimmon). The probe and the reference beam were measured with silicon detectors and then combined in a differential amplifier (DA 1853A, LeCroy) with an additional stage of a 350-MHz preamplifier (SR445A, Stanford Research Systems). The total gain was 50-fold. The temperature was controlled as described previously (10.Singh V.R. Kopka M. Chen Y. Wedemeyer W.J. Lapidus L.J. Dynamic Similarity of the Unfolded States of Proteins L and G.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10046-10054Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Measurement of each sample at six temperatures - 0, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 °C) took about 20 min, so aggregation during this time was negligible. The viscosity of each solvent at each temperature was measured independently using a cone-cup viscometer (Brookfield engineering). PICUP reactions were performed with minor modifications on previously described protocols (11.Bitan G. Structural study of metastable amyloidogenic protein oligomers by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12.Lopes D.H.

Biol. 2012; 849: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified α-synuclein was aliquoted in 15 or 60 μm stock solutions, for the 3 and 30 μm reactions, respectively, in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and stored at −80 °C. CLR01 was dissolved at 600 or 1,000 μm, respectively, in the same buffer. The appropriate α-synuclein and CLR01 solutions were mixed to provide the final concentrations in 18 μl in PCR tubes followed by addition of 1 μl Ru(Bpy) and 1 μl APS, irradiation for 1 s, and quenching immediately with 20 μl of Tricine sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Before loading on gels, 30 μm solutions were diluted 10-fold with sample buffer. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 1-mm-thick, 10–20% Tricine gradient gels (Invitrogen). Non-cross-linked proteins were used as a control for the cross-linked proteins in each condition for each experiment and ran as monomers in all cases (data not shown). Protein bands were visualized by silver staining (Invitrogen). Gels were scanned and the abundance of each band was calculated densitometrically relative to the entire lane using Image J. For the Trp-Cys quenching experiments in this work, the wild-type (WT) sequence of α-synuclein was modified to contain a Phe→Trp substitution at position 94 and an Ala→Cys substitution at position 69 so that Trp-Cys quenching could be measured (7.Ahmad B. Chen Y. Lapidus L.J. Aggregation of α-synuclein is kinetically controlled by intramolecular diffusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 2336-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previously, Ahmad et al. showed that these mutations did not change the aggregation rate, as measured by ThT fluorescence or the CD spectrum, significantly relative to the WT sequence (7.Ahmad B. Chen Y. Lapidus L.J. Aggregation of α-synuclein is kinetically controlled by intramolecular diffusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 2336-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using this mutant sequence, Ahmad et al. measured intramolecular contact rates as a function of temperature and solution viscosity and found that intramolecular diffusion slowed significantly with increasing temperature between T = 0–40 °C. The introduction of the Trp also allows using UV fluorescence to investigate the binding of the molecular tweezer by its effect on the quantum yield and maximum emission wavelength, which in turn reveals information about the protein conformation. It was shown previously that CLR01 bound to Lys with a dissociation constant of 4–30 × 10−6 m using fluorescence at relatively high concentrations (13.Dutt S. Wilch C. Gersthagen T. Talbiersky P. Bravo-Rodriguez K. Hanni M. Sánchez-García E. Ochsenfeld C. Klärner F.G. Schrader T. Molecular tweezers with varying anions: a comparative study.J. Org. Chem. 2013; 78: 6721-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the binding of CLR01 to α-synuclein, which contains 15 Lys (Fig. 1) in the sequence, starting at substantially lower concentrations taking advantage of the relatively high quantum yield of Trp fluorescence. Fig. 2, a and b show an initial increase in fluorescence of Trp-94 in α-synuclein upon addition of CLR01, which fits well to a hyperbolic curve that saturates before 1 μm, the concentration of the protein, indicating high-affinity binding. Binding also was measured by native mass-spectrometry, which allows observation of free and bound α-synuclein directly (total protein concentration: 10 μm), yielding a binding constant KD = 0.16 μm as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. However, increasing the concentration of CLR01 revealed additional binding events. Mass-spectrometry indicated a second binding event with KD = 3 μm. Analysis of the intrinsic fluorescence of CLR01 when bound to wild-type α-synuclein suggested a binding event with KD ∼1.8 μm (at a CLR01 concentration: 15 μm), in agreement with the mass-spectrometry results. At CLR01 concentrations > 10 μm, the fluorescence spectrum of Trp-94 becomes contaminated by the fluorescence from the CLR01 itself, which peaks at ∼340 nm, causing an increase in background fluorescence and making it difficult to fit dissociation constants. However, if the entire fluorescence spectrum is analyzed with singular value decomposition (svd), the shift in the Trp-94 spectrum due to CLR01 binding can be well separated from the overall changes in total fluorescence, as shown in Fig. 2, b and c and yields two transitions at KD = 0.79 μm and KD = 7 μm. CLR01 fluorescence also suggested a transition with KD > 100 μm that was not well resolved over the concentrations studied. Thus there appear to be binding events with KD values ranging from 10−7 to 10−4 m.FIGURE 2Effect of CLR01 binding on Trp-94 fluorescence and CLR01 fluorescence.

This suggests that Trp-94 is sequestered in a small hydrophobic pocket. Note that in a previous study, binding of α-synuclein to curcumin caused a decrease in Trp-94 fluorescence, so it is likely that the binding site of curcumin is different than that of CLR01 (8.Ahmad B. Lapidus L.J. Curcumin Prevents Aggregation in α-Synuclein by Increasing Reconfiguration Rate.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 9193-9199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Importantly, although the Trp is less solvent-exposed, this does not mean the entire chain is more compact, as shown below. To elucidate the predominant binding site of CLR01 to α-synuclein, we used native electrospray-ionization mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS); a technique that can measure non-covalent ligand binding to large macromolecules (14.Loo J.A. Studying noncovalent protein complexes by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1997; 16: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Previously, this approach was used to study relatively weak solution binding of small molecule ligands to α-synuclein (15.Xie Y. Zhang J. Yin S. Loo J.A. Top-down ESI-ECD-FT-ICR mass spectrometry localizes noncovalent protein-ligand binding sites.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 14432-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). By using neutral pH solutions and relatively gentle conditions in the mass spectrometer, weak non-covalent interactions can be preserved for their measurement by ESI-MS. Under these conditions, the sites of ligand binding can be deciphered by tandem mass-spectrometry (MS/MS) or “top-down” MS of the protein-ligand complex. Using ECD, covalent backbone bonds of the polypeptide are cleaved while non-covalent forces holding the ligand bound to the macromolecule are maintained. ECD-MS/MS of protein:ligand complexes yields fragments or product ions of the protein chain, some of which are still bound to the ligand. The sequence of these ligand-bound fragments can be mapped onto the full-length protein sequence to determine the ligand binding region(s) (15.Xie Y. Zhang J. Yin S. Loo J.A.

Top-Down Mass Spectrometry of Supercharged Native Protein-Ligand Complexes.Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2011; 300: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This strategy was used previously to measure the binding of CLR01 to amyloid β-protein (18.Sinha S. Lopes D.H. Du Z. Pang E.S. Shanmugam A. Lomakin A. Talbiersky P. Tennstaedt A. McDaniel K. Bakshi R. Kuo P.Y. Ehrmann M. Benedek G.B. Loo J.A. Klärner F.G. Schrader T. Wang C. Bitan G. Lysine-specific molecular tweezers are broad-spectrum inhibitors of assembly and toxicity of amyloid proteins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 16958-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and therefore we applied ESI-MS/MS with ECD here to determine the sites of CLR01 binding to α-synuclein. Using an equimolar, 10-μm solution of α-synuclein and CLR01, ESI-MS showed a stable 1:1 protein-ligand complex (Fig. 3A). Approximately 20% of α-synuclein was complexed with CLR01 in this solution. The 13+-charged ions for the 1:1 α-synuclein-CLR01 complex were subjected to ECD-MS/MS fragmentation. Protein fragments of the c- (retaining the N terminus) and z• - (retaining the C terminus) product-ion series were observed. Some product ions from dissociation of the polypeptide backbone corresponded to unbound protein (Fig. 3B, black lines), whereas other product ions retained binding to CLR01 (Fig. 3B, red lines). At some positions along the polypeptide chain, product ions were observed in both CLR01-bound and unbound states. Compared with our previous study with amyloid β-protein (Aβ) (18.Sinha S. Lopes D.H. Du Z. Pang E.S. Shanmugam A. Lomakin A. Talbiersky P. Tennstaedt A. McDaniel K. Bakshi R. Kuo P.Y. Ehrmann M. Benedek G.B. Loo J.A. Klärner F.G. Schrader T. Wang C. Bitan G. Lysine-specific molecular tweezers are broad-spectrum inhibitors of assembly and toxicity of amyloid proteins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 16958-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), ECD appears to induce more dissociation of CLR01 from α-synuclein. Nonetheless, the specific observation of a CLR01-bound c20-product ion (a 20-residue fragment from the N terminus) and a CLR01-bound z•131-product ion (a 131-residue fragment from the C terminus) suggests that the binding is located in the α-synuclein region spanning residues 10–20, most likely at Lys-10 and/or Lys-12. To test experimentally whether under the conditions used for the Trp-Cys quenching experiments α-synuclein was monomeric or consisted of higher-order oligomers, we applied photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) (11.Bitan G. Structural study of metastable amyloidogenic protein oligomers by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19.Bitan G. Teplow D.B. Rapid photochemical cross-linking—a new tool for studies of metastable, amyloidogenic protein assemblies.Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This method uses visible light to produce Ru3+, a strong one-electron oxidizer that can then abstract an electron from a susceptible side chain in a protein, producing a radical, which in turn can covalently bond to another side chain on another protein. Fig. 4a shows that at room temperature, PICUP produces a range of oligomers (using the WT sequence of α-synuclein) with higher oligomer orders more abundant at 30 μm, than at 3 μm α-synuclein. Importantly, however, observation of cross-linked oligomers in PICUP experiments does not necessarily mean that these oligomers existed before the cross-linking. Distinguishing pre-existing oligomers from those generated by random collisions of monomers during the cross-linking reaction requires analysis of the entire population and comparison to theoretical models (20.Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Amyloid β-protein oligomerization: prenucleation interactions revealed by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of the observed distributions (Fig. 4, d and e) shows that they are consistent with those of monomeric peptides and proteins and suggests that at the concentrations used here, the observed cross-linked oligomers are a result of stochastic collisions among monomers, rather than pre-formed oligomer (20.Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Amyloid β-protein oligomerization: prenucleation interactions revealed by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, the data strongly support the conclusion that under the conditions used here, α-synuclein was predominantly monomeric. The higher collision rate at 30 μm α-synuclein led to cross-linking of ∼60% of the protein, whereas at 3 μm only ∼25% of the protein"

However, the underlying mechanism that regulates the opening of mechanosensitive hemichannels is largely unknown. We have recently shown that Cx43 and integrin α5 interact directly with each other, and activation of PI3K appears to be required for Cx43 hemichannel opening by mechanical stimulation. Here, we show that mechanical loading through fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) increased the level of active AKT, a downstream effector of PI3K, which is correlated with the opening of hemichannels. Both Cx43 and integrin α5 are directly phosphorylated by AKT. Inhibition of AKT activation significantly reduced FFSS-induced opening of hemichannels and disrupted the interaction between Cx43 and integrin α5. Moreover, AKT phosphorylation on Cx43 and integrin α5 enhanced their interaction. In contrast to the C terminus of wild-type Cx43, overexpression of the C-terminal mutant containing S373A, a consensus site previously shown to be phosphorylated by AKT, failed to bind with α5 and hence could not inhibit hemichannel opening. Together, our results suggest that AKT activated by FFSS directly phosphorylates Cx43 and integrin α5, and Ser-373 of Cx43 plays a predominant role in mediating the interaction between these two proteins and Cx43 hemichannel opening, a crucial step to mediate the anabolic function of mechanical loading in the bone.

However, application of positive voltages and changes in protein phosphorylation and/or redox states can increase the open probability of HCs (13.Sáez J.C. Retamal M.A. Basilio D. Bukauskas F.F.

Application of several kinds of external stresses including mechanical, ionic, and ischemic stress results in the activation of connexin HCs. Besides connexin HCs, another type of channel formed by pannexin 1 (Panx1) is known to be activated in response to mechanical stress (14.Bao L. Locovei S. Dahl G. Pannexin membrane channels are mechanosensitive conduits for ATP.FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Panx1 belongs to a family of three membrane proteins (Panx1, Panx2, and Panx3) (15.Bruzzone R. Hormuzdi S.G. Barbe M.T. Herb A. Monyer H. Pannexins, a family of gap junction proteins expressed in brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13644-13649Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Compared with Panx2 whose expression is restricted to the brain, and Panx3, predominantly expressed in the skin, connective tissues, and osteoblasts, Panx1 is ubiquitously distributed in most cells and tissues (16.Penuela S. Gehi R. Laird D.W. The biochemistry and function of pannexin channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Panx1 channels are large and can be expected to allow the passage of most molecules to which connexin channels are permeable (17.Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. Pannexin-1 mediates large pore formation and interleukin-1β release by the ATP-gated P2X7 receptor.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Panx1 channels release ATP to the extracellular medium in response to mechanical stress in Xenopus oocytes (14.Bao L. Locovei S. Dahl G. Pannexin membrane channels are mechanosensitive conduits for ATP.FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Each connexin subunit contains four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, a cytoplasmic loop, and a C-terminal domain (18.Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Güldenagel M. Deutsch U. Söhl G. Structural and functional diversity of connexin genes in the mouse and human genome.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain varies widely in length and sequence and is thought to play key regulatory roles as well as provide for sites of protein-protein interactions and posttranslational phosphorylation (19.Hervé J.C. Bourmeyster N. Sarrouilhe D. Diversity in protein-protein interactions of connexins: emerging roles.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 22-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cx43, the most ubiquitously expressed connexin, is differentially phosphorylated at multiple serine residues throughout its life cycle (20.Lampe P.D. Lau A.F.

Connexin phosphorylation as a regulatory event linked to gap junction channel assembly.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cx43 is dynamic and changes in response to activation by different kinases, including PKA, PKC, p34cdc2, CKI, MAPK (22.Solan J.L. Lampe P.D. Connexin 43 phosphorylation: structural changes and biological effects.Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). PKB, a Ser/Thr kinase, often known as AKT, has also been shown to phosphorylate Cx43 on Ser-369 and Ser-373 residues (23.Park D.J. Wallick C.J. Martyn K.D. Lau A.F.J.C. Warn-Cremer B.J.

Adhes. 2007; 14: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the functional importance is yet unknown. In mammals, three isoforms of AKT (AKT-1, AKT-2, and AKT-3) are present which are independently encoded by three genes (24.Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. PI3K/Akt and apoptosis: size matters.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). We showed recently that mechanical stimulation facilitates the opening of Cx43 HC likely through PI3K activation (25.Batra N. Burra S. Siller-Jackson A.J. Gu S. Xia X. Weber G.F. DeSimone D. Bonewald L.F. Lafer E.M. Sprague E. Schwartz M.A. Jiang J.X. Mechanical stress-activated integrin α5β1 induces opening of connexin 43 hemichannels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 3359-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that integrin α5 and Cx43 are direct substrates of AKT, a major kinase activated by PI3K. AKT phosphorylation of integrin α5 and Cx43 enhances their interaction and maintains the HC in the open state. The AKT phosphorylation residue, Ser-373 of Cx43, plays a major role in the interaction with integrin α5 and HC opening. The regulated opening of HCs could be imperative to anabolic responses of mechanical stimuli on bone tissues by a controlled release of bone modulators. Therefore, AKT conveys mechanical signals to HCs and directly regulates HC function in osteocytes. MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells derived from murine long bones were cultured on rat tail collagen type I (0.15 mg/ml) (BD Biosciences)-coated polyester surfaces (Regal Plastics, San Antonio, TX) and were grown in α-modified essential medium (α-MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5% FBS and 2.5% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C as described previously (26.Kato Y.

Cultured MLO-Y4 cells were collected from 150-mm tissue culture plates and rinsed in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA/EGTA, pH 8.0) or radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer and then ruptured by triturating through a 26t[ifrax1,2]-gauge needle 20 times. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer or radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer for immunoprecipitation (IP) and co-IP respectively. SDS and Triton X-100 were added to a final concentration of 0.5% each and put on ice for 30 min followed by a brief boiling for 3 min only for IP. Boiled samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove the debris. IP buffer was added to the cell lysates to obtain a final concentration of SDS and Triton X-100 to 0.07%. Lysates were precleared with protein G beads (protein G-Sepharose fast flow 4B; Amersham Biosciences) and pelleted by centrifugation at 1800 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Supernatants (precleared lysates) were then incubated with anti-Cx43 or anti-integrin α5 antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by precipitation of the complexes after incubation at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein G or mouse IgG-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with affinity purified anti-Cx43 (E2) (1:300 dilution), anti-phosphoserine AKT substrate antibody (1:1000), anti-integrin α5 (1:1000), or anti-β1 (1:1000) antibody. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion protein was prepared from the GST-tagged C-terminal domain of Cx43 (GST-Cx43-CT) and was in vitro phosphorylated with purified AKT-1 kinase using ATP or [γ-32P]ATP. GST alone or in vitro reaction without AKT-1 kinase served as a negative control. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and 2 and 4 h and stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. The proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer on nitrocellulose membrane and Western blotting. For 32P-containing samples, gels were dried and exposed to an x-ray film at −80 °C. Protein pulldown experiments were carried out on nonphosphorylated GST-Cx43CT or phosphorylated GST-Cx43CT after in vitro phosphorylation reactions as described above using peptide composed of the C terminus of integrin α5. Two biotinylated peptides (each of 27 amino acids in length; >95% purity) were synthesized to cover integrin α5 C terminus (LGFFKRSLPYGTAMEKAQLKPPATSDA-biotin) and a scrambled peptide (LGKSATPYAQFGMLTKASELDPRFKPAK-biotin). Biotinylated peptides were subsequently conjugated to streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads® for 30 min at room temperature. The peptide-conjugated beads were washed with PBS at pH 7.4 and incubated with 10 μg of GST-Cx43CT overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the binding proteins were eluted in nonreducing SDS sample buffer containing 0.1% SDS, incubation at room temperature for 10 min, and boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Elutes were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with affinity-purified anti-Cx43 (C-terminal) (1:300 dilution) or anti-GST antibody (1:5000). Fluid flow was generated by parallel plate flow chambers separated by a gasket of defined thickness with gravity-driven fluid flow using a peristaltic pump. The thickness of the gasket determines the channel height. By adjusting the channel height and flow rate, stress levels of 16 dynes/cm2 were generated. Cells were plated in the flow chamber with the surface area of 5 cm2. Controls consisted of MLO-Y4 cells in SMEM not subjected to FFSS. Each test was conducted for the respective time as indicated. The circulating medium was SMEM. The entire flow system was encased within a large walk-in CO2 incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. MLO-Y4 cells were grown at the density that the majority of the cells were not physically in contact with one another. SMEM, a Ca2+-free medium, was used for fluid flow at 16 dynes/cm2 for 10 min. Control cells (not subjected to FFSS) were washed three times with SMEM. After FFSS, cells were incubated for dye uptake experiments with 0.2% LY (molecular mass ∼547 Da) and 0.2% RD (∼10 kDa) dye mixture for 5 min. RD was used as a negative control. Cells were then fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed once with PBS before mounting the slides for microscopy. Similar fields were observed under the fluorescence microscope. Dye uptake was determined as a ratio of fluorescent cells to total cells per image. We calibrated the dye uptake results by normalizing the data with unstimulated controls. The fluorescence intensity for unstimulated controls is not zero as a low level of basal dye uptake has been observed. In this case, multiple images from each group were taken, and approximately 100 cells as observed through phase contrast microscopy were counted per group. Similarly, cells that uptake LY or RD were counted. The ratio of the cells that uptake LY dye, but not control cells uptaking RD, and cells observed under phase contrast was calculated. These ratios were normalized to the controls to provide a clear understanding of the -fold increase in dye uptake. Results were expressed as normalized dye uptake (designated as 1) over the respective unstimulated control group. All of our dye uptake experiments were conducted on low density cultures to minimize cell contact with the neighboring cells. We quantified the areas of the cells without visible cell-cell contact. MLO-Y4 cells transfected with GFP-Cx43CT, GFP-Cx43CTS373A, and GFP-Cx43CTS369A,S373A constructs were assayed for dye uptake using a mixture of Alexa Fluor 350 (1 mm) and RD (2%) after subjecting the cells to FFSS. The C terminus of Cx43 encoding the amino acid sequence from 231 to 384 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1(a) containing GFP to generate the C-terminal Cx43-GFP construct (GFP-Cx43CT). S369A and S373A mutants (GFP-Cx43CTS373A and GFP-Cx43CTS369A,S373A) were generated using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Qiagen). MLO-Y4 cells were transfected with these constructs and also with GFP alone in pcDNA3.1 construct using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), and dye uptake was performed. Positive cells for transfection were identified by GFP expression. For protein analysis, the constructs were transfected into the MLO-Y4 cells using the NeonTM transfection system (Invitrogen), and the expression of the endogenous Cx43 and transfected GFP-Cx43CT was determined by Western blotting with our affinity-purified antibody against the C terminus of Cx43 (1:300) or anti-GFP antibody (1:1000) (Abcam). MLO-Y4 cells expressing GFP-Cx43CT or GFP-Cx43CTS373A were cultured as described above, and then cells were cooled on ice for 30 min followed by incubation with polyclonal sheep anti-integrin α5 antibody against secondary extracellular loop domain (1:200 dilution) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed four times with DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Invitrogen) and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in DPBS at 4 °C for 15 min. The cells were then blocked with 2% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 1% fish gelatin for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with polyclonal rabbit anti-Cx43 E2 antibody (1:200 dilutions). The labeling by primary antibodies was detected by incubation with donkey anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h for integrin α5 and then incubation with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) for 1 h for Cx43. Slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000, Vector Laboratories) and sealed for microscopy. Confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). The sequential laser scanning was conducted at a thickness of 0.5 μm. Images were deconvoluted using Iterative deconvolution software of ImageJ, with a known point spread function (for each image 30 iterations were applied with a low pass filter diameter of 0.4 pixel). Brightness and contrast were adjusted off-line to improve clarity for each image; no data were added or deleted. To obtain the Mander's coefficient number, as an index of overlapping of pixels obtained from one channel over another channel, JACoP plugin of ImageJ was used All of the data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.04 software. One-way analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keul test were used for more than two compared groups, and paired Student's t test was used for comparison between two groups. Unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three determinations. Asterisks indicate the degree of significant differences compared with the controls (*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001). We recently showed that inhibition of PI3K activation blocked the HC opening induced by FFSS (25.Batra N. Burra S. Siller-Jackson A.J. Gu S. Xia X. Weber G.F. DeSimone D. Bonewald L.F. Lafer E.M. Sprague E. Schwartz M.A. Jiang J.X. Mechanical stress-activated integrin α5β1 induces opening of connexin 43 hemichannels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 3359-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible involvement of PI3K signaling. Here we showed a significant increase in the levels of active AKT, indicated by AKT phosphorylation at the Ser-473 site after 30 min of FFSS, persisting after 2 h, and then declining from 4 h until reaching the basal non-FFSS level after 24 h (Fig. 1A). There is a nonspecific protein band marked with *. This band tends to become faint with fluid flow. We suspect that this could be a nonspecific, “sticky” matrix protein which gets “washed off” by flow. Because FFSS activates AKT, we sought to identify which of the three AKT isoforms was expressed in osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells. Of the three AKT isoforms, AKT-1 and not the other two isoforms, was predominantly expressed in MLO-Y4 cells (Fig. 1B). HeLa, C2C12, and mouse brain known to have high expression of AKT-1, 2, and 3, respectively, were used as positive controls. To determine whether AKT is involved in the opening of Cx43 HCs, AKTi, an inhibitor specific to the AKT-1 and AKT-2 isoforms, was applied to MLO-Y4 cells after addition of fresh medium with serum. The absence of phosphorylation on the two sites, Ser-473 and Thr-308, confirmed the inactivation of AKT in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 2A). The effect of FFSS-activated AKT on HC opening was examined through LY dye uptake assay. Cells were pretreated with AKTi and subjected to FFSS for 30 min, a time point when pAKT levels reach maximal. Inhibition of AKT activation induced by FFSS significantly reduced the opening of Cx43 HCs (Fig. 2B). We then asked whether activation of AKT is critical for the interaction between Cx43 and α5. Treatment with AKTi disrupted the interaction between Cx43 and α5 (Fig. 2C) as demonstrated through the absence of Cx43 in the immunoprecipitates from AKTi-treated cells using α5 antibody. Our results suggest that activation of AKT induced by FFSS is important for the interaction between Cx43 and integrin α5, and the opening of Cx43 HCs. To determine whether Cx43 and integrin α5 are substrates for AKT kinase, either of the proteins was immunoprecipitated with the respective antibody (Cx43 or α5 antibody), and the elutes were immunoblotted with a motif antibody to AKT-phosphorylated substrates. Both Cx43 and integrin α5 are substrates of AKT as detected by the AKT substrate antibody (Fig. 3, A and B). To understand how FFSS-activated AKT could possibly influence the phosphorylation of Cx43 and integrin α5, we studied the phosphorylation of Cx43 and integrin α5 mediated by AKT. Lysates collected from different time points of FFSS treatment were immunoprecipitated with either Cx43 or α5 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Pro/Ser AKT substrate as well as Cx43 or α5 antibody. Phosphorylation on both Cx43 and α5 appeared to increase by nearly 2-fold after 2 h of FFSS (Fig. 3, C and D) and decreased after 24 h. Cx43 phosphorylation by AKT started to decrease after 4 h (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that Cx43 and integrin α5 are phosphorylated by AKT activated upon FFSS. To determine which domains of Cx43 and α5 are the target sites of phosphorylation by AKT, we performed in vitro kinase and pulldown assays. Purified cytoplasmic C-terminal (GST-Cx43CT) and an extracellular loop domain of Cx43 tagged to GST (GST-Cx43E2) were used. The purified AKT-1 kinase phosphorylated GST-Cx43CT in a time-dependent manner. However, this kinase could not phosphorylate either GST-Cx43E2 or GST even after 4 h (Fig. 4A). The weak protein bands were observed even without the incubation of AKT, which could be caused by low reactivity of this antibody to nonphosphorylated residue. To further confirm this observation, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP which would enhance the specificity of the reaction. Consistently, in the presence of AKT-1, only GST-Cx43CT was radioactively labeled by [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4B). The effect of phosphorylation on the cytoplasmic C-terminal domains of Cx43 and α5 attributing to their interaction was determined by an in vitro pulldown assay. In this experiment, the pulldown of GST-Cx43CT was tested with a biotinylated peptide containing the C terminus of integrin α5 attached to the streptavidin beads. The interaction between the two proteins increased greatly upon phosphorylation of the C terminus of Cx43 (Fig. 4C). The result was further confirmed through the increased pulldown of Cx43, phosphorylated in vitro by AKT-1 kinase from the lysate of MLO-Y4 cells using the peptide containing α5 C terminus (Fig. 4D). Together, these results suggest that AKT phosphorylation on the cytoplasmic domains of Cx43 promoted its interaction with integrin α5. We then addressed whether phosphorylation on either or both Cx43 and α5 was critical for the interaction. We conducted a series of sequential in vitro pulldown experiments using purified GST-Cx43CT and α5 C-terminal peptide. When neither of the two proteins was phosphorylated, a low level of interaction was observed (Fig. 5). The level of the interaction increased only when α5 peptide was phosphorylated. However, a dramatic increase in the interaction was observed when GST-Cx43CT was phosphorylated regardless of the phosphorylation state of α5. This result implied that although phosphorylation of α5 enhanced its ability to interact with Cx43, phosphorylation of Cx43 by AKT played a predominant role in the interaction between these two proteins. To identify the site on Cx43 which could be phosphorylated by AKT and be essential for the interaction with α5 thereby affecting the HC opening, we conducted a scansite database search. The analysis revealed two potential AKT phosphorylation sites on the Cx43 C terminus, Ser-369 and Ser-373, the latter having a higher probability (within the top 2% (1.178%)) of potential AKT phosphorylation sites). This analysis is consistent with a previous report of the phosphorylation of Ser-373 by AKT (23.Park D.J. Wallick C.J. Ma"

Here, we report the crystal structure of the human β3 subunit immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a functionally important component of Nav channels in neurons and cardiomyocytes. Surprisingly, we found that the β3 subunit Ig domain assembles as a trimer in the crystal asymmetric unit. Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the presence of Ig domain monomers, dimers, and trimers in free solution, and atomic force microscopy imaging also detected full-length β3 subunit monomers, dimers, and trimers. Mutation of a cysteine residue critical for maintaining the trimer interface destabilized both dimers and trimers. Using fluorescence photoactivated localization microscopy, we detected full-length β3 subunit trimers on the plasma membrane of transfected HEK293 cells. We further show that β3 subunits can bind to more than one site on the Nav 1.5 α subunit and induce the formation of α subunit oligomers, including trimers. Our results suggest a new and unexpected role for the β3 subunits in Nav channel cross-linking and provide new structural insights into some pathological Nav channel mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2024619133,"Amyloid fibrils are supramolecular assemblies, the deposition of which is associated with many serious diseases including Alzheimer, prion, and Huntington diseases. Several smaller aggregates such as oligomers and protofibrils have been proposed to play a role in early stages of the fibrillation process; however, little is known about how these species contribute to the formation of mature amyloid fibrils with a rigid cross-β structure. Here, we identified a new pathway for the formation of insulin amyloid fibrils at a high concentration of salt in which mature fibrils were formed in a stepwise manner via a prefibrillar intermediate: minute prefibrillar species initially accumulated, followed by the subsequent formation of thicker amyloid fibrils. Fourier transform infrared spectra suggested the sequential formation of two types of β-sheets with different strength hydrogen bonds, one of which was developed concomitantly with the mutual assembly of the prefibrillar intermediate to form mature fibrils. Interestingly, fibril propagation and cellular toxicity appeared only after the later step of structural organization, and a comparison of β-sheet regions between the prefibrillar intermediate and mature fibrils using proteolysis led to the proposal of specific regions essential for manifestation of these properties."

Evidence is also provided that, by 4 weeks after diabetes onset in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model, there is a large loss of trabecular bone mineral density without apparent proportional changes in underlying collagen matrices, a large accumulation of a hyaluronan matrix within the trabecular bone marrow, and adipocytes and macrophages embedded in this hyaluronan matrix. These results support the hypothesis that hyperglycemia in bone marrow diverts dividing osteoblastic precursor cells (bone marrow stromal cells) to a metabolically stressed adipogenic pathway that induces synthesis of a hyaluronan matrix that recruits inflammatory cells and establishes a chronic inflammatory process that demineralizes trabecular cancellous bone."
https://openalex.org/W2049165350,"Heparan sulfate (HS) is a component of cell surface and extracellular matrix proteoglycans that regulates numerous signaling pathways by binding and activating multiple growth factors and chemokines. The amount and pattern of HS sulfation are key determinants for the assembly of the trimolecular, HS-growth factor-receptor, signaling complex. Here we demonstrate that HS 6-O-sulfotransferases 1 and 2 (HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2), which perform sulfation at 6-O position in glucosamine in HS, impact ovarian cancer angiogenesis through the HS-dependent HB-EGF/EGFR axis that subsequently modulates the expression of multiple angiogenic cytokines. Down-regulation of HS6ST-1 or HS6ST-2 in human ovarian cancer cell lines results in 30–50% reduction in glucosamine 6-O-sulfate levels in HS, impairing HB-EGF-dependent EGFR signaling and diminishing FGF2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in cancer cells. These cancer cell-related changes reduce endothelial cell signaling and tubule formation in vitro. In vivo, the development of subcutaneous tumor nodules with reduced 6-O-sulfation is significantly delayed at the initial stages of tumor establishment with further reduction in angiogenesis occurring throughout tumor growth. Our results show that in addition to the critical role that 6-O-sulfate moieties play in angiogenic cytokine activation, HS 6-O-sulfation level, determined by the expression of HS6ST isoforms in ovarian cancer cells, is a major regulator of angiogenic program in ovarian cancer cells impacting HB-EGF signaling and subsequent expression of angiogenic cytokines by cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2030863049,"Solution structures and biochemical data have provided a wealth of mechanistic insight into Ras GTPases. However, information on how much the membrane organization of these lipid-modified proteins impacts on their signaling is still scarce. Ras proteins are organized into membrane nanoclusters, which are necessary for Ras-MAPK signaling. Using quantitative conventional and super-resolution fluorescence methods, as well as mathematical modeling, we investigated nanoclustering of H-ras helix α4 and hypervariable region mutants that have different bona fide conformations on the membrane. By following the emergence of conformer-specific nanoclusters in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, we found that conformers impart distinct nanoclustering responses depending on the cytoplasmic levels of the nanocluster scaffold galectin-1. Computational modeling revealed that complexes containing H-ras conformers and galectin-1 affect both the number and lifetime of nanoclusters and thus determine the specific Raf effector recruitment. Our results show that mutations in Ras can affect its nanoclustering response and thus allosterically effector recruitment and downstream signaling. We postulate that cancer- and developmental disease-linked mutations that are associated with the Ras membrane conformation may exhibit so far unrecognized Ras nanoclustering and therefore signaling alterations."

Phosphorylation of any two of the residues Thr-342, Thr-345, and Ser-346 is required for full activity, and the death domain regulates the activation of IRAK4.

However, the extent to which tTG cooperates with other proteins within the context of a cancer cell, versus its intrinsic ability to confer transformed characteristics to cells, is poorly understood. To address this question, we asked what effect the ectopic expression of tTG in a non-transformed cellular background would have on the behavior of the cells. Using NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing a Myc-tagged form of tTG, we found that tTG strongly protected these cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis and triggered the activation of the PI3-kinase/mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1)/p70 S6-kinase pathway. We determined that tTG forms a complex with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src and PI3-kinase, and that treating cells with inhibitors to block tTG function (monodansylcadaverine; MDC) or c-Src kinase activity (PP2) disrupted the formation of this complex, and prevented tTG from activating the PI3-kinase pathway. Moreover, treatment of fibroblasts over-expressing tTG with PP2, or with inhibitors that inactivate components of the PI3-kinase pathway, including PI3-kinase (LY294002) and mTORC1 (rapamycin), ablated the tTG-promoted survival of the cells.

However, tTG has also been suggested to play crucial roles in the progression of a number of human disease states. In particular, during the past decade, several laboratories, including our own, have shown that increases in tTG expression are hallmarks of various types of human cancer including breast, brain, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers (11.Yuan L.

The indications that the overexpression of tTG contributes to tumor progression and metastasis raise an important question, namely to what extent are the contributions of tTG to cancer progression shaped by the cancer cell context and the various signaling proteins present within transformed cells, versus the intrinsic ability of tTG to alter normal cellular behavior. Indeed, various studies have suggested that tTG can work together with different signaling proteins in the background of a cancer cell (17.Antonyak M.A. Li B. Regan A.D. Feng Q. Dusaban S.S.

One example from studies performed in our laboratory involves the ability of tTG to influence the transformed characteristics of human breast cancer cells. In particular, we discovered, when using the human SKBR3 breast cancer cell line as a model, that tTG expression and activation were strongly up-regulated in an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent manner. Moreover, tTG was essential for the EGF-stimulated growth of these cancer cells in monolayer, as well as for their anchorage-independent growth and importantly, their survival in the face of stress conditions and apoptotic challenges such as chemotherapeutic agents (20.Li B. Antonyak M.A. Druso J.E. Cheng L. Nikitin A.Y. Cerione R.A. EGF potentiated oncogenesis requires a tissue transglutaminase-dependent signaling pathway leading to Src activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We then demonstrated that a key element in the transformed characteristics of these breast cancer cells, as imparted by tTG, was its ability to form a complex with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase and proto-oncogene c-Src. Here, we have set out to determine whether tTG has the ability to alter the behavior of non-transformed cells, as a means of obtaining insights into the capability of this protein in the absence of a cancer cell context to induce characteristics necessary for malignant transformation. To address this important question, we have examined the biological consequences of ectopically expressing tTG in NIH3T3 cells, a fibroblast cell line. Interestingly, we found that tTG strongly promoted NIH3T3 cell survival by enhancing the activation of the canonical PI3-kinase/mTORC1/p70 S6-kinase pathway. We then went on to demonstrate that the ability of tTG to activate this signaling pathway was through the assembly of a complex consisting of tTG, c-Src, and PI3-kinase. Importantly, treating the cells with either the Src inhibitor, PP2, or MDC, disrupted the interaction between c-Src and tTG, as well as blocked the ability of tTG to stimulate PI3-kinase-mediated signaling events. Thus, these findings point to tTG as being a key participant in a c-Src-PI3-kinase signaling pathway and that it is able to associate with these signaling proteins even in a non-transformed cellular context. This capability is likely to have important consequences for enabling cancer cells to survive various apoptotic challenges including treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. All cell culture reagents (unless mentioned otherwise), Lipofectamine, EGF, and protein G-agarose beads were from Invitrogen. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were obtained from Sigma, while PP2, LY294002, and rapamycin were from Calbiochem. Biotinylated pentylamine (BPA) was obtained from Pierce, and the Myc and HA antibodies were from Covance. The Ras, pan-p70 S6-kinase, and p85 antibodies were from Millipore, the tTG antibody was from Zedira, the p110 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the actin antibody was from Neomarkers. The anti-phosphotyrosine, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP antibodies, as well as the antibodies that recognize the total, activated, and/or phosphorylated forms of ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), c-Jun (Ser-63/Ser-73), AKT (Thr-308 and Ser-473), mTOR (S2448), p70 S6-kinase (Thr-389), p85 (Tyr-458), and PTEN (Ser-380/Thr-382/Thr-383) were from Cell Signaling. Parental NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum (CS), while HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The pcDNA3 constructs encoding the Myc-tagged forms of wild-type tTG or tTG C277V and the HA-tagged forms of H-Ras G12V, c-Src, v-Src, p85, or p110α, were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine. Clones of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing the vector alone or a Myc-tagged form of wild-type tTG were selected by culturing the cells in DMEM containing 10% CS and 2 μg/ml puromycin. Once individual clones expressing either the vector alone or the Myc-tagged form of tTG were obtained, the cells were then maintained in the same growth medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Where indicated, cells were treated with 50 μm MDC, 0.1 μg/ml EGF, 10 μm PP2, 10 μm LY294002, or 50 nm rapamycin. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The Bio-Rad DC protein assay was used to determine the protein concentrations of the cell lysates. Fifteen micrograms of whole cell extracts collected from parental NIH3T3 cells or NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the vector alone or a Myc-tagged form of tTG, were incubated in a buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm BPA for 10 min followed by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, and blocked for 1 day in BBST (100 mm boric acid, 20 mm sodium borate, 0.01% SDS, 0.01% Tween 20, 80 mm NaCl) containing 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The PVDF membranes were then incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at a dilution of 1:2000 in BBST containing 5% BSA for 1 h, followed by extensive washing with BBST. The membranes were then exposed to ECL reagent, and the proteins that had incorporated BPA were visualized using x-ray film. Nearly confluent cultures of fibroblasts were transfected without (Mock) or with expression plasmids encoding a Myc-tagged form of tTG or an HA-tagged form of activated H-Ras (H-Ras G12V) and were maintained in DMEM containing 10% CS for 10 days. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 0.4% crystal violet to visualize any resulting foci that formed. Multiple sets of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing either the vector alone or a Myc-tagged form of tTG were grown to confluence, at which time a wound was struck down the center of each plate using a pipette tip and the cultures rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the detached cells. One set of cells was immediately fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde after striking the wound to indicate the size of the initial wound. The remaining sets of cells were then placed in DMEM containing 0.1% CS for 1 day before being fixed. The ability of the cells to migrate into the wound was visualized by light microscopy and photographed. Multiple sets of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the vector alone or a Myc-tagged form of tTG were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 2 × 104 cells/dish and maintained in DMEM containing 0.1% CS. One set of the cells was counted every 2 days, while the medium on the remaining sets of cells was replenished. The growth assays were carried-out over a span of 6 days. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing either the vector alone or a Myc-tagged form of tTG were seeded in 6-well dishes and then maintained in serum-free medium without or with PP2, LY294002, MDC or rapamycin for the indicated lengths of time. The cells (both floating and attached) were then collected and stained with DAPI (2 μg/ml) for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensed and/or blebbed nuclei. Serum-starved cultures of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the vector alone or a Myc-tagged form of tTG were treated without or with EGF for 10 min and lysed. Immunoprecipitations using a p85 antibody were performed on the cell lysates, and then the immunocomplexes were subjected to kinase reactions through the addition of ATP and PI(4,5)P2. The resulting production of PI(3,4,5)P3 was quantified using an ELISA-based assay kit obtained from Echelon Biosciences. All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates (typically 1.2 mg) were initially pre-cleared using protein G-agarose beads. The pre-cleared lysates were then incubated with an antibody for 1.5 h, followed by the addition of protein G-agarose beads for another 1.5 h. After extensive washing of the beads with cell lysis buffer, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the beads and the samples were boiled. Whole cell lysates (60 μg of each) and the resulting immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated in primary antibodies prepared in 20 mm Tris, 135 mm NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20. Horseradish-peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect the primary antibodies, followed by exposure to ECL reagent. All assays/experiments were performed a minimum of three separate times and many of the results were presented as bar graphs. In these cases, the error bars indicate standard deviation. Statistical analyses of the results were done using Excel to perform Student's t-tests. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant and were indicated with asterisks. Increases in tTG expression and activation occur in several different types of human cancer resulting in a wide range of potential interactions and cross-talk with other proteins that drive transformation (12.Kim D.S.

This has contributed to some confusion in the field regarding the many possible roles that tTG plays in cancer progression. In particular, it has been extremely difficult to identify the inherent and fundamental actions of tTG that contribute to the development of the malignant state. To determine the intrinsic capability of tTG to mediate actions relevant to cancer progression, we examined the effects of overexpressing this protein in a non-transformed cell type. The NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line was chosen as our model system for this study, as it is commonly used to read-out various types of cellular outcomes (23.Wang, J. B., Erickson, J.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A (top panel, first lane) shows that these cells express low, but detectable, levels of tTG. We then generated two different NIH3T3 stable cell lines; one expressing the vector alone and the other expressing a Myc-tagged form of wild-type tTG (Fig. 1A, second panel from the top, second and third lanes). The tTG ectopically expressed in the fibroblasts is functionally active, as indicated by its ability to catalyze the calcium-dependent incorporation of biotinylated pentylamine (BPA) into lysate proteins, as compared with parental or vector alone-expressing fibroblasts, which exhibit little detectable activity in this assay (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Previous work from our laboratory had suggested that over-expressing tTG in non-transformed cell lines was not sufficient to induce transformation, as indicated by their inability to exhibit anchorage-independent growth (i.e. as assayed by colony formation in soft agar) (26.Antonyak M.A. Li B. Boroughs L.K. Johnson J.L. Druso J.E. Bryant K.L. Holowka D.A. Cerione R.A. Cancer cell-derived microvesicles induce transformation by transferring tissue transglutaminase and fibronectin to recipient cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4852-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Here, we followed-up on these findings by performing focus formation assays on NIH3T3 cells ectopically expressing tTG. The ability of cells to form foci (i.e. distinct areas of high cell density) represents another indicator of cellular transformation that measures the ability of cells to overcome the contact inhibition exhibited by non-transformed cells when grown in monolayer. For these experiments, cultures of parental fibroblasts were transiently transfected without (Mock), or with expression plasmids encoding either tTG (tTG) or an oncogenic form of Ras (H-Ras G12V), and then were maintained in normal growth medium (DMEM containing 10% CS) for 10 days. The resulting cell cultures were then fixed and stained with crystal violet to highlight any differences in cell densities (i.e. foci) that might have occurred as an outcome of expressing tTG or activated H-Ras in the cells. As anticipated, fibroblasts expressing oncogenic Ras (H-Ras G12V) formed numerous foci (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), while neither the control fibroblasts (Mock) (Fig. 1B, top panel), nor the NIH3T3 cells transfected with the tTG plasmid (Fig. 1B, middle panel), showed detectable foci. Given that tTG has been shown to localize to the leading edges of actively migrating cancer cells where it promotes the EGF-stimulated migration of the HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line, as well as the constitutive migration exhibited by the MDAMB231 breast cancer cell line (17.Antonyak M.A. Li B.

The NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the vector alone or a Myc-tagged form of tTG were subjected to wound healing (scratch) assays to determine whether there was any difference in the rate at which these cell lines migrated. Fig. 1C shows that the extent of cell migration into the wound by fibroblasts expressing the vector alone, versus Myc-tagged tTG, was similar, suggesting that tTG is not important for promoting the general migration of these cells. We then examined the ability of tTG to impact cell survival. Serum starvation is a stress that induces a cell death response in a number of cell types, including NIH3T3 fibroblasts (26.Antonyak M.A. Li B. Boroughs L.K. Johnson J.L. Druso J.E. Bryant K.L.

Thus, we took cultures of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the vector alone or Myc-tagged tTG and placed them in serum-free medium for increasing lengths of time ranging from 0 to 48 h. The cells were then collected, and the extent of cell death was determined by staining the cells with DAPI and examining them for the appearance of condensed and/or blebbed nuclei, an indicator of apoptosis. Fig. 1D shows that the vector alone-expressing cells undergo a time-dependent apoptotic response, with ∼75% of the cells dying after being cultured in medium lacking serum for 48 h. In contrast, ∼20% of the tTG-expressing fibroblasts were apoptotic under the same culturing conditions, suggesting tTG strongly promotes the survival of the fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2071279709,"Maintenance of protein homeostasis by molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 requires their spatial and functional coordination. The cooperation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 is influenced by their interaction with the network of co-chaperone proteins, some of which contain tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. Critical to these interactions are TPR domains that target co-chaperone binding to the EEVD-COOH motif that terminates Hsp70/Hsp90. Recently, the two-TPR domain-containing protein, Tomm34, was reported to bind both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Here we characterize the structural basis of Tomm34-Hsp70/Hsp90 interactions. Using multiple methods, including pull-down assays, fluorescence polarization, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and site-directed mutagenesis, we defined the binding activities and specificities of Tomm34 TPR domains toward Hsp70 and Hsp90. We found that Tomm34 TPR1 domain specifically binds Hsp70. This interaction is partly mediated by a non-canonical TPR1 two-carboxylate clamp and is strengthened by so far unidentified additional intermolecular contacts. The two-carboxylate clamp of the isolated TPR2 domain has affinity for both chaperones, but as part of the full-length Tomm34 protein, the TPR2 domain binds specifically Hsp90. These binding properties of Tomm34 TPR domains thus enable simultaneous binding of Hsp70 and Hsp90. Importantly, we provide evidence for the existence of an Hsp70-Tomm34-Hsp90 tripartite complex. In addition, we defined the basic conformational demands of the Tomm34-Hsp90 interaction. These results suggest that Tomm34 represents a novel scaffolding co-chaperone of Hsp70 and Hsp90, which may facilitate Hsp70/Hsp90 cooperation during protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W1968777127,"Proper membrane localization of ion channels is essential for the function of neuronal cells. Particularly, the computational ability of dendrites depends on the localization of different ion channels in specific subcompartments. However, the molecular mechanisms that control ion channel localization in distinct dendritic subcompartments are largely unknown. Here, we developed a quantitative live cell imaging method to analyze protein sorting and post-Golgi vesicular trafficking. We focused on two dendritic voltage-gated potassium channels that exhibit distinct localizations: Kv2.1 in proximal dendrites and Kv4.2 in distal dendrites. Our results show that Kv2.1 and Kv4.2 channels are sorted into two distinct populations of vesicles at the Golgi apparatus. The targeting of Kv2.1 and Kv4.2 vesicles occurred by distinct mechanisms as evidenced by their requirement for specific peptide motifs, cytoskeletal elements, and motor proteins. By live cell and super-resolution imaging, we identified a novel trafficking machinery important for the localization of Kv2.1 channels. Particularly, we identified non-muscle myosin II as an important factor in Kv2.1 trafficking. These findings reveal that the sorting of ion channels at the Golgi apparatus and their subsequent trafficking by unique molecular mechanisms are crucial for their specific localizations within dendrites."

Paradoxically, the growth phase-mediated inductions of PAH1 and phosphatidate phosphatase activity do not correlate with the amount of Pah1p; enzyme abundance declined in a growth phase-dependent manner. Pah1p from exponential phase cells was a relatively stable protein, and its abundance was not affected by incubation with an extract from stationary phase cells. Recombinant Pah1p was degraded upon incubation with the 100,000 × g pellet fraction of stationary phase cells, although the enzyme was stable when incubated with the same fraction of exponential phase cells. MG132, an inhibitor of proteasome function, prevented degradation of the recombinant enzyme. Endogenously expressed and plasmid-mediated overexpressed levels of Pah1p were more abundant in the stationary phase of cells treated with MG132. Pah1p was stabilized in mutants with impaired proteasome (rpn4Δ, blm10Δ, ump1Δ, and pre1 pre2) and ubiquitination (hrd1Δ, ubc4Δ, ubc7Δ, ubc8Δ, and doa4Δ) functions. The pre1 pre2 mutations that eliminate nearly all chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome had the greatest stabilizing effect on enzyme levels. Taken together, these results supported the conclusion that Pah1p is subject to proteasome-mediated degradation in the stationary phase. That Pah1p abundance was stabilized in pah1Δ mutant cells expressing catalytically inactive forms of Pah1p and dgk1Δ mutant cells with induced expression of DGK1-encoded diacylglycerol kinase indicated that alteration in phosphatidate and/or diacylglycerol levels might be the signal that triggers Pah1p degradation.

Pah1p was stabilized in mutants with impaired proteasome (rpn4Δ, blm10Δ, ump1Δ, and pre1 pre2) and ubiquitination (hrd1Δ, ubc4Δ, ubc7Δ, ubc8Δ, and doa4Δ) functions. The pre1 pre2 mutations that eliminate nearly all chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome had the greatest stabilizing effect on enzyme levels. Taken together, these results supported the conclusion that Pah1p is subject to proteasome-mediated degradation in the stationary phase. That Pah1p abundance was stabilized in pah1Δ mutant cells expressing catalytically inactive forms of Pah1p and dgk1Δ mutant cells with induced expression of DGK1-encoded diacylglycerol kinase indicated that alteration in phosphatidate and/or diacylglycerol levels might be the signal that triggers Pah1p degradation.

Anionic phospholipids (e.g. CDP-DAG and phosphatidylinositol) stimulate PAP activity through a mechanism that increases the enzyme's affinity for PA (32.Wu W.-I. Carman G.M. Regulation of phosphatidate phosphatase activity from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by phospholipids.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas sphingoid bases (e.g. sphinganine and phytosphingosine) inhibit activity by a mechanism that excludes PA from the enzyme (33.Wu W.-I. Lin Y.-P. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. Regulation of phosphatidate phosphatase activity from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by sphingoid bases.J. Biol.

Perhaps the most important manner by which Pah1p function is modulated involves phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and the translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane (7.Pascual F.

However, the mechanisms that regulate migration of MSC to the site of tissue damage remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate in vitro that activated platelets substantially inhibit recruitment of MSC toward apoptotic cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. The alarmin high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was released by platelets upon activation and mediated inhibition of the cell death-dependent migratory response through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 expressed on the MSC. Migration of MSC to apoptotic cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts was driven by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and platelet activation was followed by HMGB1/TLR-4-dependent down-regulation of HGF receptor MET on MSC, thereby impairing HGF-driven MSC recruitment. We identify a novel mechanism by which platelets, upon activation, interfere with MSC recruitment to apoptotic cardiac cells, a process that may be of particular relevance for myocardial repair and regeneration.Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) contribute to cardiac repair after myocardial injury. Underlying molecular mechanisms remain unexplored.Results: Activated platelets inhibit recruitment of MSC to apoptotic cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts via HMGB1/TLR-4-mediated down-regulation of HGF receptor MET.Conclusion: We identify a novel mechanism by which platelets impair MSC migration to damaged cardiac cells.Significance: The cross-talk between platelets and MSC might be critical for myocardial repair.

Recently, we could demonstrate that apoptotic but not necrotic cardiomyocytes produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and induce recruitment of MSC via HGF receptor MET, providing a link between apoptotic cell death and the attraction of MSC (19.Vogel S.

In patients with acute myocardial infarction, serum levels of HMGB1 were significantly increased, peaking 12 h after infarction (35.Kohno T. Anzai T. Naito K. Miyasho T. Okamoto M. Yokota H.

Elevated levels were associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including pump failure, cardiac rupture, and in-hospital cardiac deaths. However, in experimental models of myocardial infarction, detrimental as well as cardioprotective effects of HMGB1 have been reported (36.Andrassy M. Volz H.C. Igwe J.C. Funke B. Eichberger S.N.

HMGB1 activates pattern recognition receptors Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, TLR-2, and the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a transmembrane multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily (39.Park J.S.

In this study, we show in vitro that platelets substantially inhibit recruitment of MSC to apoptotic cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Once activated, platelets release the alarmin HMGB1, which mediates inhibition of the cell death-dependent migratory response via TLR-4 expressed on the MSC. HGF drives MSC migration to apoptotic cardiac cells, and HGF receptor MET is down-regulated on MSC as a consequence of TLR-4 engagement by platelet-derived HMGB1, thereby inhibiting MSC recruitment. We provide evidence for the first time that platelet activation impairs MSC migration to apoptotic cardiac cells and identify the molecular mechanism that mediates this platelet/MSC interaction. Human bone marrow was obtained from volunteer donors after informed consent (as approved by the local ethical committee). MSC were isolated from bone marrow as described previously (19.Vogel S.

In brief, mononuclear cells were obtained by Ficoll (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) gradient centrifugation and ammonium chloride lysis of residual red blood cells. Mononuclear cells were plated in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks (Costar/Corning) in DMEM (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 30% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Lonza). After 48 h of cell culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2, non-adherent cells were removed. When reaching 80% confluence, cells were harvested with trypsin (Lonza) and replated at 1:3. Only cells from passages 3–8 were used for experiments. Immunophenotyping was performed as described before (19.Vogel S. Trapp T. Börger V. Peters C. Lakbir D. Dilloo D.

Human cardiac myocytes and human cardiac fibroblasts, both isolated primary cells from the ventricles of an adult heart, were obtained from Promo Cell (Heidelberg, Germany), cultured in myocyte growth medium or fibroblast growth medium 3 (both from PromoCell) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. To confirm their identity as cardiac myocytes or fibroblasts, immunofluorescence stainings with a monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric α-actinin (1 μg/ml; mouse IgG1; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and a polyclonal antibody against fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100A4; 2 μg/ml; goat IgG; Biorbyt, Cambridge, UK) were carried out. For this, the cells were grown for 24 h on coverslips kept within a 24-well culture plate in their respective culture media. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the respective primary antibodies, washed with PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-tagged goat anti-mouse IgG or donkey anti-goat IgG (both 1:100; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Following another washing step, nuclei were stained by incubation with TO-PRO-3 iodide for 15 min (final 1 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were washed again, and coverslips were mounted with antifade fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). Confocal immunofluorescence analysis was performed using a LSM510 META confocal laser-scanning microscope and ZEN 2012 imaging software (Carl Zeiss). Induction of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts was carried out by incubation with 300 nm staurosporine (Calbiochem) or 10 mm sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h. Necrosis was initiated by treatment with 40 μm H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h or 25% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h (19.Vogel S. Trapp T. Börger V. Peters C. Lakbir D. Dilloo D.

Apoptotic and necrotic cell death of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts was confirmed with annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry as recommended by the manufacturer (Beckman-Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). After induction of apoptosis or necrosis, culture medium was exchanged, and cells were incubated for 12 h to obtain conditioned medium (CM).

Blood was centrifuged at 430 × g for 20 min, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was added to Tyrode's-HEPES buffer (HEPES (2.5 mmol/liter), NaCl (150 mmol/liter), KCl (1 mmol/liter), NaHCO3 (2.5 mmol/liter), NaH2PO4 (0.36 mmol/liter), glucose (5.5 mmol/liter), BSA (1 mg/ml), pH 6.5) and centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the platelet pellet was suspended in Tyrode's-HEPES buffer (pH 7.4; supplemented with CaCl2 (1 mmol/liter), MgCl2 (1 mmol/liter)). For certain experiments, 3 × 108 freshly isolated platelets were activated in 1 ml of PBS (pH 7.4; Lonza) by treatment with 50 μm ADP (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA) or 5 μg/ml C-reactive protein (CRP; from Richard Farndale, University of Cambridge) for 5, 15, or 30 min and centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min to obtain platelet supernatant. Generation of platelet supernatant from unactivated (resting) platelets followed the same procedure in the absence of platelet agonists. Migration of MSC toward vital, apoptotic, or necrotic cardiac myocytes or cardiac fibroblasts was analyzed in 24-well plates and transwell cell culture inserts with 8-μm pore membrane filters (Costar/Corning). MSC (105 cells/well in 200 μl of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA) were loaded into the upper chamber, and CM derived from vital, apoptotic, or necrotic cardiac myocytes or fibroblasts or recombinant HGF (20–60 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) served as chemoattractants that were loaded into the bottom chamber. When indicated, MSC were preincubated in 24-well plates for 24 h with platelet supernatants supplemented with 10% FCS (CM derived from platelets; 2 × 105 cells/well in 300 μl) or with PBS supplemented with 10% FCS containing ADP (50 μm) or CRP (5 μg/ml) or with recombinant HMGB1 (10–40 ng/ml; R&D Systems). Further, neutralization studies were performed by adding neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody (10 μg/ml, mouse IgG2b κ; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), irrelevant isotype control antibody (10 μg/ml, mouse IgG2b κ; Biolegend), or glycyrrhizin, a specific HMGB1 inhibitor (10 μg/ml; Calbiochem), to CM derived from activated platelets prior to preincubation of the MSC. In other experiments, HMGB1-receptors RAGE, TLR-2, and TLR-4 were blocked on MSC prior to MSC preincubation with CM of activated platelets or recombinant HMGB1 by treatment with anti-human RAGE polyclonal antibody (20 μg/ml, goat IgG), anti-human TLR-2 monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml, mouse IgG2b), or anti-human TLR-4 polyclonal antibody (10 μg/ml, goat IgG) (all from R&D Systems). To study the contribution of HGF to MSC migration toward apoptotic cardiac myocytes or fibroblasts, neutralizing anti-HGF polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml, goat IgG; R&D Systems) or normal goat IgG (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the targets in the bottom chambers of the transwell system. To evaluate migration of MSC, the plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 12 h, the upper side of the filters was then carefully washed with PBS, and remaining cells that had not penetrated the filters were removed with cotton swabs. Cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filters were fixed in methanol and then stained with hematoxylin (Merck). After being washed, migrated cells were observed with a light microscope at ×10 magnification, pictures were captured, and migrated cells were counted in the center of each filter. To determine the distribution of HMGB1 in resting and activated platelets, isolated platelets (3 × 108 cells/ml) were incubated with 50 μm ADP, 5 μg/ml CRP or PBS for 15 min and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, platelets were applied to 0.01% poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. After blocking with 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HMGB1 polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml; rabbit IgG; Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 0.1% Tween 20, platelets were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-tagged goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature and washed, and the coverslips were mounted with antifade fluorescence mounting medium. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as described above. To investigate the"
https://openalex.org/W2040812255,"Avocado is a diploid angiosperm containing 24 chromosomes with a genome estimated to be around 920 Mb. It is an important fruit crop worldwide but is susceptible to a root rot caused by the ubiquitous oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi. Phytophthora root rot (PRR) causes damage to the feeder roots of trees, causing necrosis. This leads to branch-dieback and eventual tree death, resulting in severe losses in production. Control strategies are limited and at present an integrated approach involving the use of phosphite, tolerant rootstocks, and proper nursery management has shown the best results. Disease progression of PRR is accelerated under high soil moisture or flooding conditions. In addition, avocado is highly susceptible to flooding, with even short periods of flooding causing significant losses. Despite the commercial importance of avocado, limited genomic resources are available. Next generation sequencing has provided the means to generate sequence data at a relatively low cost, making this an attractive option for non-model organisms such as avocado. The aims of this study were to generate sequence data for the avocado root transcriptome and identify stress-related genes. Tissue was isolated from avocado infected with P. cinnamomi, avocado exposed to flooding and avocado exposed to a combination of these two stresses. Three separate sequencing runs were performed on the Roche 454 platform and produced approximately 124 Mb of data. This was assembled into 7685 contigs, with 106 448 sequences remaining as singletons. Genes involved in defence pathways such as the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways as well as genes associated with the response to low oxygen caused by flooding, were identified. This is the most comprehensive study of transcripts derived from root tissue of avocado to date and will provide a useful resource for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2157507072,"The stabilisation of HIF-α is central to the transcriptional response of animals to hypoxia, regulating the expression of hundreds of genes including those involved in angiogenesis, metabolism and metastasis. HIF-α is degraded under normoxic conditions by proline hydroxylation, which allows for recognition and ubiquitination by the von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase complex. The aim of our study was to investigate the posttranslational modification of HIF-1α in tumours, to assess whether there are additional mechanisms besides reduced hydroxylation leading to stability. To this end we optimised antibodies against the proline-hydroxylated forms of HIF-1α for use in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) immunohistochemistry to assess effects in tumour cells in vivo. We found that HIF-1α proline-hydroxylated at both VHL binding sites (Pro402 and Pro564), was present in hypoxic regions of a wide range of tumours, tumour xenografts and in moderately hypoxic cells in vitro. Staining for hydroxylated HIF-1α can identify a subset of breast cancer patients with poorer prognosis and may be a better marker than total HIF-1α levels. The expression of unhydroxylated HIF-1α positively correlates with VHL in breast cancer suggesting that VHL may be rate-limiting for HIF degradation. Our conclusions are that the degradation of proline-hydroxylated HIF-1α may be rate-limited in tumours and therefore provides new insights into mechanisms of HIF upregulation. Persistence of proline-hydroxylated HIF-1α in perinecrotic areas suggests there is adequate oxygen to support prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) activity and proline-hydroxylated HIF-1α may be the predominant form associated with the poorer prognosis that higher levels of HIF-1α confer."

This is the first report on hBVR peptide-mediated IRK activation and conformational change. (290)KYCCSRK, which increased IRK V(max) without changing K(m), stimulated glucose uptake and potentiated insulin and IGF-1 stimulation in 4 cell lines. KYCCSRK in native hBVR was necessary for the hBVR and IRK cross-activation. Peptide treatment also activated PI3K downstream effectors, Akt and ERK, phosphorylation, and Elk transcriptional activity. In cells transfected with CMV-regulated EGFP-VP-peptide plasmid, C(292)→A mutant did not stimulate glucose uptake; K(296)→A decreased uptake and kinase activity. KEDQYMKMTV, corresponding to hBVR's SH2-binding domain, was a potent inhibitor of glucose uptake and IRK. The mechanism of action of peptides was examined using cells expressing IRK (aa 988-1263) activated by coexpressed KYCCSRK. Three active cys-mutants of IRK, with fluorophore coupled to cysteines, C(1056), C(1138), or C(1234), were examined for changes in fluorescence emission spectra in the presence of peptides. KYCCSRK and KEDQYMKMTV bound to different sites in IRK. The findings identify novel agents for activating or inhibiting insulin signaling and offer a new approach for treatment of type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W1991422736,"Dividing neuroendocrine cells differentiate into a neuronal-like phenotype in response to ligands activating G protein-coupled receptors, leading to the elevation of the second messenger cAMP. Growth factors that act at receptor tyrosine kinases, such as nerve growth factor, also cause differentiation. We report here that two aspects of cAMP-induced differentiation, neurite extension and growth arrest, are dissociable at the level of the sensors conveying the cAMP signal in PC12 and NS-1 cells. Following cAMP elevation, neuritogenic cyclic AMP sensor/Rapgef2 is activated for signaling to ERK to mediate neuritogenesis, whereas Epac2 is activated for signaling to the MAP kinase p38 to mediate growth arrest. Neither action of cAMP requires transactivation of TrkA, the receptor for NGF. In fact, the differentiating effects of NGF do not require activation of any of the cAMP sensors protein kinase A, Epac, or neuritogenic cyclic AMP sensor/Rapgef2 but, rather, depend on ERK and p38 activation via completely independent signaling pathways. Hence, cAMP- and NGF-dependent signaling for differentiation are also completely insulated from each other. Cyclic AMP and NGF also protect NS-1 cells from serum withdrawal-induced cell death, again by two wholly separate signaling mechanisms, PKA-dependent for cAMP and PKA-independent for NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2001575246,"Dominant and recessive mutations in collagen VI genes, COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3, cause a continuous spectrum of disorders characterized by muscle weakness and connective tissue abnormalities ranging from the severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy to the mild Bethlem myopathy. Herein, we report the development of a mouse model for dominant collagen VI disorders by deleting exon 16 in the Col6a3 gene. The resulting heterozygous mouse, Col6a3(+/d16), produced comparable amounts of normal Col6a3 mRNA and a mutant transcript with an in-frame deletion of 54 bp of triple-helical coding sequences, thus mimicking the most common molecular defect found in dominant Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy patients. Biosynthetic studies of mutant fibroblasts indicated that the mutant α3(VI) collagen protein was produced and exerted a dominant-negative effect on collagen VI microfibrillar assembly. The distribution of the α3(VI)-like chains of collagen VI was not altered in mutant mice during development. The Col6a3(+/d16) mice developed histopathologic signs of myopathy and showed ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle and abnormal collagen fibrils in tendons. The Col6a3(+/d16) mice displayed compromised muscle contractile functions and thereby provide an essential preclinical platform for developing treatment strategies for dominant collagen VI disorders."

Recombinant P450 2U1 was purified and used as a reagent in a metabolomic search for substrates in bovine brain. In addition to fatty acid oxidation reactions, an oxidation of endogenous N-arachidonoylserotonin was characterized. Subsequent NMR and mass spectrometry and chemical synthesis showed that the main product was the result of C-2 oxidation of the indole ring, in contrast to other human P450s that generated different products. N-Arachidonoylserotonin, first synthesized chemically and described as an inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase, had previously been found in porcine and mouse intestine; we demonstrated its presence in bovine and human brain samples. The product (2-oxo) was 4-fold less active than N-arachidonoylserotonin in inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase. The rate of oxidation of N-arachidonoylserotonin was similar to that of arachidonic acid, one of the previously identified fatty acid substrates of P450 2U1. The demonstration of the oxidation of N-arachidonoylserotonin by P450 2U1 suggests a possible role in human brain and possibly other sites."
https://openalex.org/W2052104137,"The Ku70-Ku80 ring complex encloses DNA ends to facilitate telomere maintenance and DNA break repair. Many studies focus on the ring-forming regions of subunits Ku70 and Ku80. Less is known about the Ku70 C-terminal tail, which lies outside the ring. Our results suggest that this region is responsible for dynamic sumoylation of Yku70 upon DNA association in budding yeast. Mutating a cluster of five lysines in this region largely eliminates Yku70 sumoylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses show that yku70 mutants with these lysines replaced by arginines exhibit reduced Ku-DNA association at both telomeres and internal DNA breaks. Consistent with this physical evidence, Yku70 sumoylation deficiency is associated with impaired ability to block DNA end resection and suppression of multiple defects caused by inefficient resection. Correlating with these, yku70 mutants with reduced sumoylation levels exhibit shorter telomeres, increased G overhang levels, and altered levels of non-homologous end joining. We also show that diminution of sumoylation does not affect Yku70 protein levels or its interactions with protein and RNA partners. These results suggest a model whereby Yku70 sumoylation upon DNA association strengthens Ku-DNA interaction to promote multiple functions of Ku."
https://openalex.org/W2018309862,"Retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC)-activating proteins (GCAPs) regulate visual photoresponse and trigger congenital retinal diseases in humans, but GCAP interaction with its target enzyme remains obscure. We mapped GCAP1 residues comprising the RetGC1 binding site by mutagenizing the entire surface of GCAP1 and testing the ability of each mutant to bind RetGC1 in a cell-based assay and to activate it in vitro. Mutations that most strongly affected the activation of RetGC1 localized to a distinct patch formed by the surface of non-metal-binding EF-hand 1, the loop and the exiting helix of EF-hand 2, and the entering helix of EF-hand 3. Mutations in the binding patch completely blocked activation of the cyclase without affecting Ca(2+) binding stoichiometry of GCAP1 or its tertiary fold. Exposed residues in the C-terminal portion of GCAP1, including EF-hand 4 and the helix connecting it with the N-terminal lobe of GCAP1, are not critical for activation of the cyclase. GCAP1 mutants that failed to activate RetGC1 in vitro were GFP-tagged and co-expressed in HEK293 cells with mOrange-tagged RetGC1 to test their direct binding in cyto. Most of the GCAP1 mutations introduced into the ""binding patch"" prevented co-localization with RetGC1, except for Met-26, Lys-85, and Trp-94. With these residues mutated, GCAP1 completely failed to stimulate cyclase activity but still bound RetGC1 and competed with the wild type GCAP1. Thus, RetGC1 activation by GCAP1 involves establishing a tight complex through the binding patch with an additional activation step involving Met-26, Lys-85, and Trp-94."
https://openalex.org/W2013675913,"Radiation therapy for head and neck cancer can result in extensive damage to normal adjacent tissues such as the salivary gland and oral mucosa. We have shown previously that tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-64 and Tyr-155 activates PKCδ in response to apoptotic stimuli by facilitating its nuclear import. Here we have identified the tyrosine kinases that mediate activation of PKCδ in apoptotic cells and have explored the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for suppression of irradiation-induced apoptosis. We identify the damage-inducible kinase, c-Abl, as the PKCδ Tyr-155 kinase and c-Src as the Tyr-64 kinase. Depletion of c-Abl or c-Src with shRNA decreased irradiation- and etoposide-induced apoptosis, suggesting that inhibitors of these kinases may be useful therapeutically. Pretreatment with dasatinib, a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked phosphorylation of PKCδ at both Tyr-64 and Tyr-155. Expression of ""gate-keeper"" mutants of c-Abl or c-Src that are active in the presence of dasatinib restored phosphorylation of PKCδ at Tyr-155 and Tyr-64, respectively. Imatinib, a c-Abl-selective inhibitor, also specifically blocked PKCδ Tyr-155 phosphorylation. Dasatinib and imatinib both blocked binding of PKCδ to importin-α and nuclear import, demonstrating that tyrosine kinase inhibitors can inhibit nuclear accumulation of PKCδ. Likewise, pretreatment with dasatinib also suppressed etoposide and radiation induced apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, pre-treatment of mice with dasatinib blocked radiation-induced apoptosis in the salivary gland by >60%. These data suggest that tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be useful prophylactically for protection of nontumor tissues in patients undergoing radiotherapy of the head and neck."
https://openalex.org/W2027835075,The 20 residue Trp-cage mini-protein is one of smallest proteins that adopt a stable folded structure containing also well-defined secondary structure elements. The hydrophobic core is arranged around a single central Trp residue. Despite several experimental and simulation studies the detailed folding mechanism of the Trp-cage protein is still not completely understood. Starting from fully extended as well as from partially folded Trp-cage structures a series of molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent and using four different force fields was performed. All simulations resulted in rapid collapse of the protein to on average relatively compact states. The simulations indicate a significant dependence of the speed of folding to near-native states on the side chain rotamer state of the central Trp residue. Whereas the majority of intermediate start structures with the central Trp side chain in a near-native rotameric state folded successfully within less than 100 ns only a fraction of start structures reached near-native folded states with an initially non-native Trp side chain rotamer state. Weak restraining of the Trp side chain dihedral angles to the state in the folded protein resulted in significant acceleration of the folding both starting from fully extended or intermediate conformations. The results indicate that the side chain conformation of the central Trp residue can create a significant barrier for controlling transitions to a near native folded structure. Similar mechanisms might be of importance for the folding of other protein structures.

To better understand the adaptation, evolution, transmission and pathogenic capacity, further investigations into the importance of the different genes harboured by LA-MRSA ST398 are required. In this study we generated a genome-wide transposon mutant library in an LA-MRSA ST398 isolate to evaluate genes important for bacterial survival in laboratory and host-specific environments. The transposon mutant library consisted of approximately 1 million mutants with around 140,000 unique insertion sites and an average number of unique inserts per gene of 44.8. We identified LA-MRSA ST398 essential genes comparable to other high-throughput S. aureus essential gene studies. As ST398 is the most common MRSA isolated from pigs, the transposon mutant library was screened in whole porcine blood. Twenty-four genes were specifically identified as important for bacterial survival in porcine blood. Mutations in 23 of these genes resulted in attenuated bacterial fitness. Seven of the 23 genes were of unknown function, whereas 16 genes were annotated with functions predominantly related to carbon metabolism, pH shock and a variety of regulations and only indirectly to virulence factors. Mutations in one gene of unknown function resulted in a hypercompetitive mutant. Further evaluation of these genes is required to determine their specific relevance in blood survival."

Furthermore, miR-7a inhibition leads to activation of mTOR signaling and promotes adult beta cell replication in mouse primary islets (33.Wang Y. Liu J. Liu C. Naji A. Stoffers D.A.

Analysis of miRNAs showing differential expression between normal pancreas and pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) identified 87 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated miRNA in PETs (34.Roldo C. Missiaglia E. Hagan J.P. Falconi M. Capelli P. Bersani S. Calin G.A. Volinia S. Liu C.G. Scarpa A. Croce C.M.

Oncol. 2006; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Among the down-regulated miRNAs, miR-155 showed lack of detectable expression in PETs upon comparison with normal pancreas (34.Roldo C. Missiaglia E. Hagan J.P. Falconi M. Capelli P. Bersani S. Calin G.A. Volinia S. Liu C.G. Scarpa A. Croce C.M.

Oncol. 2006; 24: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Whereas inactivation of the MEN1 gene is among the most frequent genetic events identified in sporadic PETs (35.Perren A. Komminoth P. Heitz P.U. Molecular genetics of gastroenteropancreatic endocrine tumors.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), little is known as to whether menin is involved in regulating miRNAs during the pathogenesis of the MEN1 syndrome. Here, we show that menin interacts with arsenite-resistance protein 2 (ARS2), a component of the nuclear cap-binding complex, and facilitates processing of primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA) including pri-let-7a and pri-miR-155, reducing the levels of Insr and Irs2, both let-7a targets. Moreover, anti-miR-mediated knockdown of let-7a results in increased levels of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2). These findings unravel the role of menin in regulating the biogenesis of miRNAs via interaction with ARS2 and expression of a key component of the insulin-signaling pathway, IRS2. Retroviral plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged menin have been described previously (36.Schnepp R.W. Chen Y.X. Wang H. Cash T. Silva A. Diehl J.A. Brown E. Hua X. Mutation of tumor suppressor gene Men1 acutely enhances proliferation of pancreatic islet cells.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5707-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Lentiviral constructs expressing Ars2 were obtained from Open Biosystems. Lentiviral packaging plasmids, pMD2G and pAX2G, were purchased from Addgene. MEFs and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. Cells were lysed in radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma) on ice for 10 min and sonicated to shear the genomic DNA. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. Antibodies used were anti-menin (Bethyl, A300-105A), anti-IRS2 (Cell Signaling, antibody 4502), anti-RAS (Millipore, catalog 05-516), anti-ARS2 (37.Gruber J.J. Zatechka D.S. Sabin L.R. Yong J.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells with TRIzol and an RNeasy extraction kit from Qiagen. One μg of RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III RT from Invitrogen, and real-time PCR was performed on the 7500 Fast Real Time PCR machine from Applied Biosystems. Either Gapdh or Hprt1 mRNA levels were used as endogenous controls, and analysis was done using the relative quantification method according to instructions from ABI. miRNA was isolated using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit from Invitrogen. Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis/binding solution, and RNA was extracted with acid-phenol:chloroform. One-third volume of ethanol was added to the aqueous phase and passed through a filter cartridge. Another two-third volume of ethanol was added to the filtrate, mixed, and passed through a second filter cartridge. Finally, the miRNA was eluted with 100 μl of elution solution at 95 °C. cDNA was synthesized using the NCode miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit from Invitrogen. Briefly, a poly(A) tail was added to the miRNA samples using poly(A) polymerase, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. First strand cDNA was synthesized from the polyadenylated miRNA by reverse transcription using the supplied Universal RT Primer Superscript III RT/RNaseOUT enzyme mix and incubated at 50 °C for 50 min. To generate pri-let-7a, PCR was performed using primers flanking the pre-let-7a hairpin of the mouse locus. Forward and reverse primers added ssRNA flanks as well as a 5′-XhoI and 3′-XbaI site. The resulting PCR products were digested and cloned into pcDNA3.1. Pri-let-7a template for in vitro transcription was generated from the pri-miRNA-pcDNA3 construct described above. PCR was employed to add on a 5′ T7 promoter (5′-TCG TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA TAT CCA TCA CAC TGG CGG CC-3′) and (5′- GCT GAT CAG CGA GCT CTA GC-3′). Radiolabeled pri-let-7a was generated using the T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [32P]UTP according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were prepared from MEFs in radioimmuneprecipitation assay buffer followed by sonication and centrifugation. A reaction mixture containing 15 μl of cell lysate, 6.4 mm MgCl2, and radiolabeled pri-let-7a transcript was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. RNA was extracted using TRIzol and resolved on a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were detected by autoradiography. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v 5.0, GraphPad Software). The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. A two-tailed Student's t test was used for measuring statistical differences. Menin acts as a scaffold protein coordinating the function of different proteins (38.Yokoyama A. Cleary M.L. Menin critically links MLL proteins with LEDGF on cancer-associated target genes.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 36-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanisms by which it represses gene transcription and cell proliferation are not fully understood. We sought to identify novel menin-interacting partners to provide further insight into menin-mediated regulation of cell proliferation. To this end, ectopically expressed menin was purified by affinity chromatography using FLAG M2 beads, and the menin-interacting proteins were excised for characterization by mass spectroscopy. Analysis of the purified proteins showed that ARS2 was among the major eluted proteins (Fig. 1A). ARS2 is a component of the nuclear RNA cap-binding complex that stabilizes the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript for processing by the Microprocessor complex consisting of Drosha and DGCR8, and thus plays an essential role in miRNA-mediated silencing (37.Gruber J.J.

To confirm ARS2 as a menin-interacting partner, we performed co-immunoprecipitation in cell lysates from HEK293 cells ectopically expressing menin. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-menin antibody effectively pulled down ARS2 (Fig. 1B), indicating ARS2 as a novel menin-interacting partner. A previous report showed that depletion of ARS2 results in reduced levels of several miRNAs including miR-21, let-7, and miR-155 (37.Gruber J.J. Zatechka D.S. Sabin L.R. Yong J. Lum J.J. Kong M.

To determine whether menin plays a role in the biogenesis of certain miRNAs, we compared mature let-7a and miR-155 levels in Men1l/l;CreER MEFs, a cell line in which Men1 can be effectively excised upon treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Fig. 2A). qRT-PCR analysis showed that mature let-7a and miR-155 expression levels were substantially reduced upon Men1 excision (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, ectopic expression of menin in BON cells, a human neuroendocrine carcinoid cell line that expresses low levels of endogenous menin (40.Stålberg P. Grimfjärd P. Santesson M. Zhou Y. Lindberg D. Gobl A. Oberg K. Westin G. Rastad J. Wang S. Skogseid B.

Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2326-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), resulted in increased levels of let-7a (Fig. 2D), consistent with the idea that menin facilitates the processing of let-7a. To determine whether menin affects miRNA levels at the transcriptional level, we examined the levels of pri-miRNA in both WT and Men1-excised cells. The levels of pri-let-7a (Fig. 3A) and pri-miR-155 (Fig. 3B) in Men1-excised cells were similar to levels in control WT cells. These findings indicate that menin promotes the biogenesis of certain miRNAs, including let-7a and miR-155, post-transcriptionally at the level of miRNA processing.FIGURE 3Menin does not affect the levels of the pri-miRNA transcript. Men1l/l and Men1l/l;CreER MEFs were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and the levels of pri-let7a (A) and pri-miR-155 (B) were determined by qRT-PCR. Error bars indicate ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because menin does not affect the transcript level of pri-let-7a (Fig. 3A), and ARS2 has been shown to be involved in the processing of pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA, we determined whether menin affects the processing of pri-let-7a to pre-let-7a biochemically. We performed a miRNA-processing assay using 32P-radiolabeled pri-let-7a as the substrate and cell lysates from either menin-expressing or menin-null cells. Lysates from menin-null cells contained diminished processing activity compared with lysates from control WT cells, which generated a cleavage product of ∼94 nucleotides (Fig. 4). This result indicates that menin plays a role in the biogenesis of let-7a by enhancing the processing of pri-let-7a to pre-let-7a. To determine whether the decrease in the processing of pri-let-7a in Men1-excised cells results from decreased levels of components of the pri-miRNA processing machinery, we examined the levels of Drosha and CBP80. Our results show that the protein levels of Drosha, an RNase III enzyme that executes the initial step of miRNA processing in the nucleus along with DGCR8 (17.Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Rådmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. The nuclear RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA processing.Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3970) Google Scholar), and CBP80, a nuclear cap-binding protein (37.Gruber J.J. Zatechka D.S. Sabin L.R. Yong J. Lum J.J. Kong M. Zong W.X. Zhang Z. Lau C.K. Rawlings J. Cherry S. Ihle J.N. Dreyfuss G. Thompson C.B. Ars2 links the nuclear cap-binding complex to RNA interference and cell proliferation.Cell. 2009; 138: 328-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), are comparable in both menin-excised and wild type cells (Fig. 5). This indicates that the role of menin in the processing of pri-let-7a does not occur via regulation of the expression levels of the Microprocessor complex, but rather by enhancing the stability of the pri-let-7a transcript. To elucidate the causal relationship between the interaction of menin and ARS2 in miRNA processing, we knocked down Ars2 expression in both WT and menin-null cells. A significant reduction in the levels of ARS2 protein was observed in both cell types using three independent clones of shRNA targeting Ars2 (Fig. 6A). qRT-PCR analysis indicated a 40% decrease in let-7a levels in WT cells for all three shRNAs examined (Fig. 6B). On the contrary, Ars2 knockdown did not affect let-7a levels in Men1-excised cells (Fig. 6B). These findings indicate that the impact of ARS2 on miRNA processing depends on the presence of menin, strongly suggesting that menin and ARS2 interact functionally to control processing of let-7a. Using prediction algorithms, Insr and Irs2 were previously identified as let-7 targets based on sequence complementarity between the miRNA and the 3′-UTR of target genes (41.Frost R.J. Olson E.N.

Inhibition of let-7a using anti-miRs prevented down-regulation of IRS2 expression in the liver of mice on a high fat diet, confirming IRS2 as a let-7a target (41.Frost R.J. Olson E.N.

Importantly, IRS2 plays a central role in peripheral insulin signaling and pancreatic beta cell proliferation, and disruption of IRS2 causes type 2 diabetes in mice (42.Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S.

We have shown previously that excision of the Men1 gene ameliorated pre-existing glucose intolerance and increased both glucose-stimulated insulin release and circulating insulin levels in mouse models for diabetes (43.Yang Y.

https://openalex.org/W1972249242,"Myocilin, a causative gene for open angle glaucoma, encodes a secreted glycoprotein with poorly understood functions. To gain insight into its functions, we produced a stably transfected HEK293 cell line expressing myocilin under an inducible promoter and compared gene expression profiles between myocilin-expressing and vector control cell lines by a microarray analysis. A significant fraction of differentially expressed genes in myocilin-expressing cells was associated with cell growth and cell death, suggesting that myocilin may have a role in the regulation of cell growth and survival. Increased proliferation of myocilin-expressing cells was demonstrated by the WST-1 proliferation assay, direct cell counting, and immunostaining with antibodies against Ki-67, a cellular proliferation marker. Myocilin-containing conditioned medium also increased proliferation of unmodified HEK293 cells. Myocilin-expressing cells were more resistant to serum starvation-induced apoptosis than control cells. TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were dramatically decreased, and two apoptotic marker proteins, cleaved caspase 7 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, were significantly reduced in myocilin-expressing cells as compared with control cells under apoptotic conditions. In addition, myocilin-deficient mesenchymal stem cells exhibited reduced proliferation and enhanced susceptibility to serum starvation-induced apoptosis as compared with wild-type mesenchymal stem cells. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its upstream kinases, c-Raf and MEK, was increased in myocilin-expressing cells compared with control cells. Elevated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also observed in the trabecular meshwork of transgenic mice expressing 6-fold higher levels of myocilin when compared with their wild-type littermates. These results suggest that myocilin promotes cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis via the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1991684791,"The ability of a neuron to transduce extracellular signals into long lasting changes in neuronal morphology is central to its normal function. Increasing evidence shows that coordinated regulation of synaptic and nuclear signaling in response to NMDA receptor activation is crucial for long term memory, synaptic tagging, and epigenetic signaling. Although mechanisms have been proposed for synapse-to-nuclear communication, it is unclear how signaling is coordinated at both subcompartments. Here, we show that activation of NMDA receptors induces the bi-directional and concomitant shuttling of the scaffold protein afadin from the cytosol to the nucleus and synapses. Activity-dependent afadin nuclear translocation peaked 2 h post-stimulation, was independent of protein synthesis, and occurred concurrently with dendritic spine remodeling. Moreover, activity-dependent afadin nuclear translocation coincides with phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10p), a marker of epigenetic modification. Critically, blocking afadin nuclear accumulation attenuated activity-dependent dendritic spine remodeling and H3 phosphorylation. Collectively, these data support a novel model of neuronal nuclear signaling whereby dual-residency proteins undergo activity-dependent bi-directional shuttling from the cytosol to synapses and the nucleus, coordinately regulating dendritic spine remodeling and histone modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2008442397,"Uromodulin (UMOD)-associated kidney disease (UAKD) belongs to the hereditary progressive ER storage diseases caused by maturation defects of mutant UMOD protein. Current treatments of UAKD patients are symptomatic and cannot prevent disease progression. Two in vitro studies reported a positive effect of the chemical chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) on mutant UMOD maturation. Thus, 4-PBA was suggested as a potential treatment for UAKD. This study evaluated the effects of 4-PBA in two mouse models of UAKD. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, treatment with 4-PBA did not increase HSP70 expression or improve maturation and trafficking of mutant UMOD in vivo. Kidney function of UAKD mice was actually deteriorated by 4-PBA treatment. In transfected tubular epithelial cells, 4-PBA did not improve maturation but increased the expression level of both mutant and wild-type UMOD protein. Activation of NF-κB pathway in thick ascending limb of Henle's loop cells of UAKD mice was detected by increased abundance of RelB and phospho-IκB kinase α/β, an indirect activator of NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W2139835922,"α-Conotoxins are peptide toxins found in the venom of marine cone snails and potent antagonists of various subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). nAChRs are cholinergic receptors forming ligand-gated ion channels in the plasma membranes of certain neurons and the neuromuscular junction. Because nAChRs have an important role in regulating transmitter release, cell excitability, and neuronal integration, nAChR dysfunctions have been implicated in a variety of severe pathologies such as epilepsy, myasthenic syndromes, schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease. To expand the knowledge concerning cone snail toxins, we examined the venom of Conus longurionis. We isolated an 18-amino acid peptide named α-conotoxin Lo1a, which is active on nAChRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a conotoxin from this species. The peptide was characterized by electrophysiological screening against several types of cloned nAChRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The three-dimensional solution structure of the α-conotoxin Lo1a was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Lo1a, a member of the α4/7 family, blocks the response to acetylcholine in oocytes expressing α7 nAChRs with an IC50 of 3.24 ± 0.7 μm. Furthermore, Lo1a shows a high selectivity for neuronal versus muscle subtype nAChRs. Because Lo1a has an unusual C terminus, we designed two mutants, Lo1a-ΔD and Lo1a-RRR, to investigate the influence of the C-terminal residue. Lo1a-ΔD has a C-terminal Asp deletion, whereas in Lo1a-RRR, a triple-Arg tail replaces the Asp.

https://openalex.org/W1996918240,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein 3 (Hivep3) suppresses osteoblast differentiation by inducing proteasomal degradation of the osteogenesis master regulator Runx2. In this study, we tested the possibility of cooperation of Hivep1, Hivep2, and Hivep3 in osteoblast and/or chondrocyte differentiation. Microarray analyses with ST-2 bone stroma cells demonstrated that expression of any known osteochondrogenesis-related genes was not commonly affected by the three Hivep siRNAs. Only Hivep3 siRNA promoted osteoblast differentiation in ST-2 cells, whereas all three siRNAs cooperatively suppressed differentiation in ATDC5 chondrocytes. We further used microarray analysis to identify genes commonly down-regulated in both MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and ST-2 cells upon knockdown of Hivep3 and identified asparagine-linked glycosylation 2 (Alg2), which encodes a mannosyltransferase residing on the endoplasmic reticulum. The Hivep3 siRNA-mediated promotion of osteoblast differentiation was negated by forced Alg2 expression. Alg2 suppressed osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in cultured calvarial bone. Alg2 was immunoprecipitated with Runx2, whereas the combined transfection of Runx2 and Alg2 interfered with Runx2 nuclear localization, which resulted in suppression of Runx2 activity. Chondrocyte differentiation was promoted by Hivep3 overexpression, in concert with increased expression of Creb3l2, whose gene product is the endoplasmic reticulum stress transducer crucial for chondrogenesis. Alg2 silencing suppressed Creb3l2 expression and chondrogenesis of ATDC5 cells, whereas infection of Alg2-expressing virus promoted chondrocyte maturation in cultured cartilage rudiments. Thus, Alg2, as a downstream mediator of Hivep3, suppresses osteogenesis, whereas it promotes chondrogenesis. To our knowledge, this study is the first to link a mannosyltransferase gene to osteochondrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008651651,"Mia40-catalyzed disulfide formation drives the import of many proteins into the mitochondria. Here we characterize the oxidative folding of Cox19, a twin CX9C Mia40 substrate. Cox19 oxidation is extremely slow, explaining the persistence of import-competent reduced species in the cytosol. Mia40 accelerates Cox19 folding through the specific recognition of the third Cys in the second helical CX9C motif and the subsequent oxidation of the inner disulfide bond. This renders a native-like intermediate that oxidizes in a slow uncatalyzed reaction into native Cox19. The same intermediate dominates the pathway in the absence of Mia40, and chemical induction of an α-helical structure by trifluoroethanol suffices to accelerate productive folding and mimic the Mia40 folding template mechanism. The Mia40 role is to funnel a rough folding landscape, skipping the accumulation of kinetic traps, providing a rationale for the promiscuity of Mia40."
https://openalex.org/W2075549463,"Mammalian triokinase, which phosphorylates exogenous dihydroxyacetone and fructose-derived glyceraldehyde, is neither molecularly identified nor firmly associated to an encoding gene. Human FMN cyclase, which splits FAD and other ribonucleoside diphosphate-X compounds to ribonucleoside monophosphate and cyclic X-phosphodiester, is identical to a DAK-encoded dihydroxyacetone kinase. This bifunctional protein was identified as triokinase. It was modeled as a homodimer of two-domain (K and L) subunits. Active centers lie between K1 and L2 or K2 and L1: dihydroxyacetone binds K and ATP binds L in different subunits too distant (≈ 14 Å) for phosphoryl transfer. FAD docked to the ATP site with ribityl 4'-OH in a possible near-attack conformation for cyclase activity. Reciprocal inhibition between kinase and cyclase reactants confirmed substrate site locations. The differential roles of protein domains were supported by their individual expression: K was inactive, and L displayed cyclase but not kinase activity. The importance of domain mobility for the kinase activity of dimeric triokinase was highlighted by molecular dynamics simulations: ATP approached dihydroxyacetone at distances below 5 Å in near-attack conformation. Based upon structure, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, relevant residues were mutated to alanine, and kcat and Km were assayed whenever kinase and/or cyclase activity was conserved. The results supported the roles of Thr(112) (hydrogen bonding of ATP adenine to K in the closed active center), His(221) (covalent anchoring of dihydroxyacetone to K), Asp(401) and Asp(403) (metal coordination to L), and Asp(556) (hydrogen bonding of ATP or FAD ribose to L domain). Interestingly, the His(221) point mutant acted specifically as a cyclase without kinase activity."

The mechanisms for how these pathways are coordinated in parallel but maintain their functional specificity involves subcellular compartmentalization of kinase function by scaffolding proteins, but how this is accomplished is not well understood. Here, we focused on characterizing the molecular machinery that functions in the sequential synaptic delivery of GluA1- and GluA4-containing AMPARs using an in vitro model of eyeblink classical conditioning. We show that conditioning induces the interaction of selective protein complexes with the key structural protein SAP97, which tightly regulates the synaptic delivery of GluA1 and GluA4 AMPAR subunits. The results demonstrate that in the early stages of conditioning the initial activation of PKA stimulates the formation of a SAP97-AKAP/PKA-GluA1 protein complex leading to synaptic delivery of GluA1-containing AMPARs through a SAP97-PSD95 interaction. This is followed shortly thereafter by generation of a SAP97-KSR1/PKC-GluA4 complex for GluA4 AMPAR subunit delivery again through a SAP97-PSD95 interaction. These data suggest that SAP97 forms the molecular backbone of a protein scaffold critical for delivery of AMPARs to the PSD during conditioning.

https://openalex.org/W2082237869,"NELL1 is a large oligomeric secretory glycoprotein that functions as an osteoinductive factor. NELL1 contains several conserved domains, has structural similarities to thrombospondin 1, and supports osteoblastic cell adhesion through integrins. To define the structural requirements for NELL1-mediated cell adhesion, we prepared a series of recombinant NELL1 proteins (intact, deleted, and cysteine-mutant) from a mammalian expression system and tested their activities. A deletion analysis demonstrated that the C-terminal cysteine-rich region of NELL1 is critical for the cell adhesion activity of NELL1. Reducing agent treatment decreased the cell adhesion activity of full-length NELL1 but not of its C-terminal fragments, suggesting that the intramolecular disulfide bonds within this region are not functionally necessary but that other disulfide linkages in the N-terminal region of NELL1 may be involved in cell adhesion activity. By replacing cysteine residues with serines around the coiled-coil domain of NELL1, which is responsible for oligomerization, we created a mutant NELL1 protein that was unable to form homo-oligomers, and this monomeric mutant showed substantially lower cell adhesion activity than intact NELL1. These results suggest that an oligomerization-induced conformational change in the C-terminal region of NELL1 is important for the efficient mediation of cell adhesion and spreading by NELL1."
https://openalex.org/W2325182226,"Gyrase is a type II DNA topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. It consists of a topoisomerase core, formed by the N-terminal domains of the two GyrA subunits and by the two GyrB subunits, that catalyzes double-stranded DNA cleavage and passage of a second double-stranded DNA through the gap in the first. The C-terminal domains (CTDs) of the GyrA subunits form a β-pinwheel and bind DNA around their positively charged perimeter. As a result, DNA is bound as a positive supercoil that is converted into a negative supercoil by strand passage. The CTDs contain a conserved 7-amino acid motif that connects blades 1 and 6 of the β-pinwheel and is a hallmark feature of gyrases. Deletion of this so-called GyrA-box abrogates DNA bending by the CTDs and DNA-induced narrowing of the N-gate, affects T-segment presentation, reduces the coupling of DNA binding to ATP hydrolysis, and leads to supercoiling deficiency. Recently, a severe loss of supercoiling activity of Escherichia coli gyrase upon deletion of the non-conserved acidic C-terminal tail (C-tail) of the CTDs has been reported. We show here that, in contrast to E. coli gyrase, the C-tail is a very moderate negative regulator of Bacillus subtilis gyrase activity. The C-tail reduces the degree of DNA bending by the CTDs but has no effect on DNA-induced conformational changes of gyrase that precede strand passage and reduces DNA-stimulated ATPase and DNA supercoiling activities only 2-fold.

The integrity of chromosomal DNA is vitally important for all organisms. Cellular processes such as replication, recombination, and transcription are affected by the supercoiling state of the DNA. Topoisomerases are enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of different DNA topoisomers by cleaving one (type I) or both (type II) strands of the DNA and by transporting a second single- or double-stranded segment, provided in cis or in trans, through the gap in the first (for a review, see Ref. 1.Wang J.C.

A conserved, 7-amino acid motif within the β-pinwheel of the CTD, the GyrA-box, is located in a loop connecting the first blade of the pinwheel to blade 6 (Fig. 2, A–C) (31.Hsieh T.J. Yen T.J.

The GyrA-box is a hallmark feature of gyrase (32.Ward D. Newton A.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and is essential for DNA supercoiling (33.Kramlinger V.M. Hiasa H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 3738-3742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Its deletion reduces DNA bending and affects the communication between DNA-gate, CTDs, and N-gate, leading to a decreased DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, a failure to narrow the N-gate in response to DNA binding, and supercoiling deficiency (28.Lanz M.A. Klostermeier D. The GyrA-box determines the geometry of DNA bound to gyrase and couples DNA binding to the nucleotide cycle.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 10893-10903Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the β-pinwheel, including the GyrA-box, is shared by all CTDs, in many GyrA homologs, the CTD contains an acidic C-terminal tail (C-tail; Fig. 2, A–C) with significant divergence in length and amino acid composition. It generally contains a high number of acidic residues and lacks positively charged residues (34.Tretter E.M. Berger J.M. Mechanisms for defining supercoiling set point of DNA gyrase orthologs: I. a nonconserved acidic C-terminal tail modulates Escherichia coli gyrase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18636-18644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GyrA from Escherichia coli contains a longer tail (34 amino acids) and many acidic residues (18 amino acids), whereas the ortholog from Bacillus subtilis has a shorter tail with fewer negatively charged residues (13 and 9 amino acids, respectively). GyrA from Borrelia burgdorferi completely lacks a C-terminal extension. The C-tail has not been resolved in crystal structures of CTDs from different organisms and has even impeded crystal formation, pointing toward significant flexibility (25.Ruthenburg A.J. Graybosch D.M. Huetsch J.C. Verdine G.L. A superhelical spiral in the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase A C-terminal domain imparts unidirectional supercoiling bias.J. Biol.

In the context of gyrase, however, the C-tail confers a high DNA supercoiling efficiency, and it has been suggested that it interacts with other parts of the enzyme. The C-tail appears to be an important regulatory element that allows for fine-tuning of gyrase activity (34.Tretter E.M. Berger J.M. Mechanisms for defining supercoiling set point of DNA gyrase orthologs: I. a nonconserved acidic C-terminal tail modulates Escherichia coli gyrase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18636-18644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we present a detailed analysis of the role of the C-tail of B. subtilis gyrase in individual steps of the supercoiling cycle. We investigated the flexibility of the C-tail, its contribution to DNA binding and bending, its effect on DNA- and nucleotide-induced conformational changes of gyrase preceding strand passage, and its effect on DNA-induced ATP-hydrolysis and ATP-dependent DNA supercoiling. The C-tail reduces bending of DNA bound to the CTDs but otherwise has little effect on other events before strand passage. We do not find any indication for an interaction of the C-tail with the remainder of gyrase. Notably, the C-tail leads to a reduction in DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and in ATP-dependent DNA supercoiling, consistent with its function as a repressive element for gyrase activity. Thus, the C-tail might differentially modulate the activity of gyrases from different organisms depending on its length and charge. To generate B. subtilis GyrA lacking the C-terminal 13 amino acids 809NEEDENEEEQEEV821, the codon for Asn-809 was exchanged to a TAA stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using gyrA (coding for GyrA (36.Göttler T.

The underlined parts indicate the altered codons. A fluorescently labeled peptide with the sequence of the 13-amino acid C-terminal tail of B. subtilis GyrA was synthesized by Genosphere Biotechnologies (Paris, France) (purity higher than 95% according to HPLC-MS).

https://openalex.org/W2011364697,"VP1 is the major coat protein of murine polyomavirus and forms virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro. VLPs consist of 72 pentameric VP1 subunits held together by a terminal clamp structure that is further stabilized by disulfide bonds and chelation of calcium ions. Yeast-derived VLPs (yVLPs) assemble intracellularly in vivo during recombinant protein production. These in vivo assembled yVLPs differ in several properties from VLPs assembled in vitro from bacterially produced pentamers. We found several intermolecular disulfide linkages in yVLPs involving 5 of the 6 cysteines of VP1 (Cys(115)-Cys(20), Cys(12)-Cys(20), Cys(16)-Cys(16), Cys(12)/ Cys(16)-Cys(115), and Cys(274)-Cys(274)), indicating a highly coordinated disulfide network within the in vivo assembled particles involving the N-terminal region of VP1. Cryoelectron microscopy revealed structured termini not resolved in the published crystal structure of the bacterially expressed VLP that appear to clamp the pentameric subunits together. These structural features are probably the reason for the observed higher stability of in vivo assembled yVLPs compared with in vitro assembled bacterially expressed VLPs as monitored by increased thermal stability, higher resistance to trypsin cleavage, and a higher activation enthalpy of the disassembly reaction. This high stability is decreased following disassembly of yVLPs and subsequent in vitro reassembly, suggesting a role for cellular components in optimal assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2094104929,"Objective Although atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence is unpredictable in terms of onset and duration, current intermittent rhythm monitoring (IRM) diagnostic modalities are short-termed and discontinuous. The aim of the present study was to investigate the necessary IRM frequency required to reliably detect recurrence of various AF recurrence patterns. Methods The rhythm histories of 647 patients (mean AF burden: 12±22% of monitored time; 687 patient-years) with implantable continuous monitoring devices were reconstructed and analyzed. With the use of computationally intensive simulation, we evaluated the necessary IRM frequency to reliably detect AF recurrence of various AF phenotypes using IRM of various durations. Results The IRM frequency required for reliable AF detection depends on the amount and temporal aggregation of the AF recurrence (p<0.0001) as well as the duration of the IRM (p<0.001). Reliable detection (>95% sensitivity) of AF recurrence required higher IRM frequencies (>12 24-hour; >6 7-day; >4 14-day; >3 30-day IRM per year; p<0.0001) than currently recommended. Lower IRM frequencies will under-detect AF recurrence and introduce significant bias in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. More frequent but of shorter duration, IRMs (24-hour) are significantly more time effective (sensitivity per monitored time) than a fewer number of longer IRM durations (p<0.0001). Conclusions Reliable AF recurrence detection requires higher IRM frequencies than currently recommended. Current IRM frequency recommendations will fail to diagnose a significant proportion of patients. Shorter duration but more frequent IRM strategies are significantly more efficient than longer IRM durations. Clinical Trial Registration URL Unique identifier: NCT00806689."
https://openalex.org/W1968101733,"The large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channel is essential for maintaining the membrane in a hyperpolarized state, thereby regulating neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contraction, and secretion. The BK(Ca) α-subunit has three predicted initiation codons that generate proteins with N-terminal ends starting with the amino acid sequences MANG, MSSN, or MDAL. Because the N-terminal region and first transmembrane domain of the α-subunit are required for modulation by auxiliary β1-subunits, we examined whether β1 differentially modulates the N-terminal BK(Ca) α-subunit isoforms. In the absence of β1, all isoforms had similar single-channel conductances and voltage-dependent activation. However, whereas β1 did not modulate the voltage-activation curve of MSSN, β1 induced a significant leftward shift of the voltage activation curves of both the MDAL and MANG isoforms. These shifts, of which the MDAL was larger, occurred at both 10 μM and 100 μM Ca(2+). The β1-subunit increased the open dwell times of all three isoforms and decreased the closed dwell times of MANG and MDAL but increased the closed dwell times of MSSN. The distinct modulation of voltage activation by the β1-subunit may be due to the differential effect of β1 on burst duration and interburst intervals observed among these isoforms. Additionally, we observed that the related β2-subunit induced comparable leftward shifts in the voltage-activation curves of all three isoforms, indicating that the differential modulation of these isoforms was specific to β1. These findings suggest that the relative expression of the N-terminal isoforms can fine-tune BK(Ca) channel activity in cells, highlighting a novel mechanism of BK(Ca) channel regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2003338804,"The expression of the angiopoietin (Ang) receptor, Tie2, on both endothelial and inflammatory cells supports the idea that Ang signaling may play a fundamental role in initiating and maintaining the inflammatory response. We have previously shown that Ang1 and/or Ang2 alter the innate immune response by enhancing human neutrophil survival, chemotaxis and production of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that Ang1 and Ang2 could modulate other inflammatory signals in neutrophils, a possibility we explored through a gene-based assay looking at changes in the mRNA expression of 84 inflammatory cytokines and their receptors. We observed that Ang1 (10(-8) M), but not Ang2, increased mRNA expression of prominent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and its natural antagonist IL-1RA, by up to 32.6- and 10.0-fold respectively, compared to PBS-control. The effects of Ang1 extended to the proteins, as Ang1 increased intracellular levels of precursor and mature IL-1β, and extracellular levels of IL-1RA proteins, by up to 4.2-, 5.0- and 4.4-fold respectively, compared to PBS-control. Interestingly, Ang1 failed at inducing IL-1β protein release or at increasing intracellular IL-1RA, but the ratio of IL-1RA to mature IL-1β remained above 100-fold molar excess inside and outside the cells. The above-noted effects of Ang1 were mediated by MAP kinases, whereby inhibiting MEK1/2 lead to up to 70% effect reduction, whereas the blockade of p38MAPK activity doubled Ang1's effect. These findings suggest that Ang1 selectively alters the balance of neutrophil-derived inflammatory cytokines, favoring the blockade of IL-1 activity, a consideration for future therapies of inflammatory diseases."

To complete the process of budding and vesicle formation, ESCRT-III oligomerizes and forms a filament structure on the endosomal membrane, which ultimately leads to scission of a forming vesicle (15.Elia N. Fabrikant G. Kozlov M.M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Computational model of cytokinetic abscission driven by ESCRT-III polymerization and remodeling.Biophys.

Membrane-elasticity model of Coatless vesicle budding induced by ESCRT complexes.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin tags are removed before cargo molecules are included in the vesicle. Finally, the ATPase Vps4 is recruited to the site of vesicle formation. Through ATP hydrolysis, Vps4 is likely to drive the completion of vesicle formation in an irreversible direction and ultimately provide energy for the entire process (17.Elia N. Sougrat R. Spurlin T.A. Hurley J.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Dynamics of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery during cytokinesis and its role in abscission.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochemically, Vps4 catalyzes the removal of ESCRT-III oligomers from the endosomal membrane (19.Lata S. Roessle M. Solomons J. Jamin M. Gottlinger H.G. Svergun D.I. Weissenhorn W. Structural basis for autoinhibition of ESCRT-III CHMP3.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This serves two critical functions: first, to provide proper temporal and spatial control of the ESCRT-III oligomerization, thus generating appropriately sized vesicles (20.Nickerson D.P. West M. Henry R. Odorizzi G. Regulators of Vps4 ATPase activity at endosomes differentially influence the size and rate of formation of intralumenal vesicles.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1023-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and second, to recycle components of ESCRT-III to allow for continuous cargo trafficking (21.Wollert T. Wunder C. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hurley J.H. Membrane scission by the ESCRT-III complex.Nature. 2009; 458: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The role of the ESCRT proteins in MVB biogenesis is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotic cells (6.Winter V. Hauser M.T. Exploring the ESCRTing machinery in eukaryotes.Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 115-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Vps4 is a member of the AAA-ATPase (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) family. The crystal structure of Vps4 shows that it contains an N-terminal microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain and a C-terminal AAA-ATPase domain connected by a flexible linker region (22.Xiao J.

Vps4 exists in two quaternary structures, as a monomer in the absence of ATP binding and as a hexameric ring upon ATP binding (22.Xiao J. Xia H. Yoshino-Koh K. Zhou J. Xu Z. Structural characterization of the ATPase reaction cycle of endosomal AAA protein Vps4.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25.Monroe N. Han H.

Biol. 2014; 426: 510-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of Vps4 is mediated through the AAA-ATPase domain with ATP binding sites located at the subunit interface. The hexameric ring structure of Vps4 is a transient species in solution, only stable with ATP bound. Vps4 binds to many proteins in the cell, most of which are mediated through the MIT domain (26.Hurley J.H. Yang D. MIT domainia.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 6-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The MIT domain adopts a three-helix bundle structure that serves as a binding partner for the MIT-interacting motifs (MIMs) of ESCRT-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins. The MIM was initially defined as a small sequence motif (∼15–20 residues) at or near the C-terminal end of ESCRT-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins (27.Muzioł T. Pineda-Molina E. Ravelli R.B. Zamborlini A. Usami Y. Göttlinger H. Weissenhorn W. Structural basis for budding by the ESCRT-III factor CHMP3.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). There have been speculations that the MIM binds to the ESCRT-III protein core structure in the autoinhibited state of ESCRT-III. In the active state, it is exposed to the solvent and can be recognized by the MIT domain (28.Shim S. Kimpler L.A. Hanson P.I.

Kim Y.C. Hummer G. SAXS ensemble refinement of ESCRT-III CHMP3 conformational transitions.Structure. 2011; 19: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Hence, the MIM serves as a bifunctional switch of ESCRT-III function. Based on the structure and the mode of interaction with the MIT domain, several different types of MIM have been described (30.Stuchell-Brereton M.D. Skalicky J.J. Kieffer C.

For example, a MIM1 forms a small helix that binds between the second and third helices of the Vps4 MIT domain (30.Stuchell-Brereton M.D. Skalicky J.J. Kieffer C. Karren M.A. Ghaffarian S. Sundquist W.I. ESCRT-III recognition by VPS4 ATPases.Nature. 2007; 449: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 31.Obita T. Saksena S. Ghazi-Tabatabai S. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Emr S.D. Williams R.L. Structural basis for selective recognition of ESCRT-III by the AAA ATPase Vps4.Nature. 2007; 449: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a MIM2 adopts an extended structure that binds between the first and third helices (32.Kieffer C. Skalicky J.J. Morita E. De Domenico I. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Sundquist W.I. Two distinct modes of ESCRT-III recognition are required for VPS4 functions in lysosomal protein targeting and HIV-1 budding.Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 62-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Binding of ESCRT-III to Vps4 can enhance the ATP hydrolysis by Vps4, although the mechanism of action is not clear (37.Merrill S.A. Hanson P.I. Activation of human VPS4A by ESCRT-III proteins reveals ability of substrates to relieve enzyme autoinhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35428-35438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to ESCRT-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins, there are also other regulators of Vps4 function. Vta1, a positive regulator of Vps4 ATPase, binds to a unique β-domain within the AAA-ATPase domain and presumably activates Vps4 by stabilizing the hexameric ring structure required for ATP hydrolysis (38.Azmi I. Davies B. Dimaano C. Payne J. Eckert D. Babst M. Katzmann D.J. Recycling of ESCRTs by the AAA-ATPase Vps4 is regulated by a conserved VSL region in Vta 1.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 39.Xiao J. Xia H. Zhou J. Azmi I.F. Davies B.A. Katzmann D.J. Xu Z. Structural basis of Vta1 function in the multivesicular body sorting pathway.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A novel Vps4-binding protein, called Vfa1 (Vps4-associated-1), was recently identified in an overexpression study of all putative genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to look for vacuole morphology defects (40.Arlt H. Perz A. Ungermann C. An overexpression screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identifies novel genes that affect endocytic protein trafficking.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1592-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Vfa1 caused altered vacuole size, indicative of MVB dysfunction. Most interestingly, Vfa1 was found to interact with Vps4. Given the lack of knowledge about Vfa1 and how essential Vps4 regulation is, we used biochemical and biophysical methods to show that Vfa1 binds to the Vps4 MIT domain. We determined a high resolution crystal structure of the Vps4 MIT domain in complex with a C-terminal Vps4-binding fragment of Vfa1 and identified residues important for binding. Vfa1 binds to Vps4 with high affinity (∼0.47 μm) and can stimulate Vps4 ATPase activity by more than 10-fold. These results suggest that Vfa1 is a bona fide regulator of Vps4 ATPase activity with a possible role in MVB regulation. DNA fragments encoding Vfa1 and Vps4 and their various fragment constructs were amplified from the S. cerevisiae genomic DNA. These proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3) cells using a modified pET28b vector with a SUMO protein tag inserted between a His6 tag and the respective protein coding region. The His6-SUMO-tagged protein was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography following standard procedures. ULP1 protease was then added to remove the His6-SUMO tag, and the digested protein mixture was passed over a second Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Source-S column (GE Healthcare) for Vfa1 proteins and a Source-Q column (GE Healthcare) for Vps4 proteins. The Vps4-Vfa1 complex was purified by mixing the two protein fragments in stoichiometric amounts followed by gel filtration chromatography using a HiLoadTM SuperdexTM 200 (GE Healthcare) column. GST pull-down analysis was performed following standard procedures in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (22.Xiao J. Xia H. Yoshino-Koh K. Zhou J. Xu Z. Structural characterization of the ATPase reaction cycle of endosomal AAA protein Vps4.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specific samples were also supplemented with 2 mm ATP as indicated. Purified proteins were incubated with either GST alone or GST-tagged proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively with the buffer before bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. To measure the binding affinity between Vfa1 and the Vps4 MIT domain (residues 1–82), Vfa1 or Vfa1 mutants were titrated against the Vps4 MIT domain using a Nano ITCTM (TA Instruments) or an ITC-200 microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. Data were processed using the NanoAnalyze software. All proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl, centrifuged to remove any particulates, and degassed before binding analysis. Vfa1 proteins were injected at 0.23 mm (or greater for mutants) against 0.06 mm Vps4 MIT domain. The concentrations of all proteins were determined using UV spectral analysis. The procedure was adopted from previous studies with modifications as indicated (41.Chang L. Bertelsen E.B. Wisén S. Larsen E.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Gestwicki J.E. High-throughput screen for small molecules that modulate the ATPase activity of the molecular chaperone DnaK.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer used included 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2. Malachite green reagent was prepared as follows. Malachite green (0.081%, w/v), polyvinyl alcohol (2.3%, w/v), ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (5.7% (w/v) in 6 m HCl), and double-distilled water were mixed at a 2:1:1:2 ratio and then stored at 4 °C for at least 30 min. For Vps4 stimulation experiments, a 15-μl protein mixture of 0.125 μm Vps4 and 0.25 μm of Vfa1, Vfa1 mutant, or Vta1 was incubated with 10 μl of 1.2 mm ATP (all final concentrations) at 37 °C for 10 min in a 96-well plate. Protein concentrations were selected in order to see the stimulation of Vps4 hydrolysis and to avoid product inhibition. After the 10-min incubation, 80 μl of malachite green reagent was added to each well. Immediately following this step, 10 μl of 32% sodium citrate was used to inhibit the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP. The samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before A620 was measured on a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To account for intrinsic hydrolysis, the signal from ATP in identically treated buffer lacking Vps4 was subtracted. Vps4-Vfa1 complex crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 25 °C. The protein complex (17 mg/ml) was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a reservoir solution of 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6.5, in a final volume of 4 μl and equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution. Clusters of sword-shaped crystals appeared after 1 day and grew to full size after 3 days. Single crystals were isolated from the clusters and cryoprotected using the reservoir solution. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon Source Beamline 21-ID-D. The Vps4-Vfa1 complex crystal diffracted to 2.3 Å. It belongs to the space group of P212121 and contains two molecular complexes in the asymmetric unit. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (HKL Research). The PHENIX software suite was used for structure determination and refinement. The structure was solved by molecular replacement as implemented in the AutoMR module (42.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14440) Google Scholar), using the Vps4 MIT domain (Protein Data Bank accession code 2V6X) as an initial search model. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraint was applied throughout refinement. Model building was done with COOT (43.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). We first sought to confirm the interaction between Vps4 and Vfa1 as reported by Arlt et al. (40.Arlt H. Perz A. Ungermann C. An overexpression screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identifies novel genes that affect endocytic protein trafficking.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1592-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down analysis. Vps4 has been shown to exist in two oligomeric states, as a monomer and, upon binding ATP, as a hexameric ring (2.McCullough J. Colf L.A. Sundquist W.I. Membrane fission reactions of the mammalian ESCRT pathway.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 663-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 24.Landsberg M.J. Vajjhala P.R. Rothnagel R. Munn A.L.

Three-dimensional structure of AAA ATPase Vps4: advancing structural insights into the mechanisms of endosomal sorting and enveloped virus budding.Structure. 2009; 17: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Many binding partners of Vps4, including ESCRT-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins, show an ATP dependence for Vps4 binding, suggesting that they only bind to the hexameric form of Vps4 (22.Xiao J. Xia H. Yoshino-Koh K. Zhou J. Xu Z. Structural characterization of the ATPase reaction cycle of endosomal AAA protein Vps4.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39.Xiao J. Xia H. Zhou J. Azmi I.F. Davies B.A. Katzmann D.J. Xu Z. Structural basis of Vta1 function in the multivesicular body sorting pathway.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To maintain Vps4 in a stable hexameric structure, we used an ATPase-deficient mutant (E233Q) of Vps4 (44.Babst M. Sato T.K. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Endosomal transport function in yeast requires a novel AAA-type ATPase, Vps4p.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1820-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We saw that Vfa1 could bind to Vps4 in both the absence and presence of ATP (Fig. 1A). We further used size exclusion chromatography to validate the interaction between Vps4 and Vfa1. Different proteins or protein mixtures (Vfa1, Vfa1 with 2 mm ATP, Vps4, Vps4 with 2 mm ATP, Vps4 plus Vfa1, and Vps4 plus Vfa1 with 2 mm ATP) were loaded onto a 120-ml Superdex-200 column, respectively. Compositions of elution peaks were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis. Regardless of the presence of ATP, Vfa1 co-eluted with Vps4 at a position that was distinct from Vfa1 alone, suggesting that it formed a stable complex with Vps4 in solution (Fig. 1B). Therefore, Vfa1 can bind to either a monomeric or hexameric form of Vps4. We next identified the minimal binding domains between the two proteins. Vps4 contains an N-terminal MIT domain and a C-terminal canonical AAA-ATPase domain. Because most of the ESCRT-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins bind to the MIT domain, we reasoned that it might also be the site of binding for Vfa1. Indeed, deletion of the MIT domain (Vps4-ΔMIT) abolished the interaction between Vps4 and Vfa1. This was reminiscent of the interaction between Vps4 and Ist1, an ESCRT-III-related Vps4 regulator that binds to Vps4 via the MIT domain in an ATP-independent manner (45.Bajorek M. Morita E. Skalicky J.J. Morham S.G. Babst M. Sundquist W.I. Biochemical analyses of human IST1 and its function in cytokinesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1360-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but different from another regulator, Vta1, which binds to Vps4 in an ATP-dependent manner via the β-domain within the ATPase domain (Fig. 2A). ESCRT-III proteins bind to the MIT domain via C-terminal sequence motifs, known as the MIMs (46.Scott A. Gaspar J. Stuchell-Brereton M.D. Alam S.L. Skalicky J.J. Sundquist W.I. Structure and ESCRT-III protein interactions of the MIT domain of human VPS4A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13813-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction showed that Vfa1 was largely an α-helical protein with a C-terminal helix suggestive of a potential site for MIT interaction (data not shown). We therefore made a truncation mutant of Vfa1 [Vfa1(1–186)] with the C-terminal 17 residues deleted and tested whether it could still bind to Vps4. Removal of the C-terminal sequence abolished its interaction with Vps4 (Fig. 2B). These results show that Vps4-Vfa1 binding is mediated through the N-terminal MIT domain of Vps4. When ESCRT-III and ESCRT-III-related proteins bind to Vps4, they often stimulate the ATPase activity of Vps4 (37.Merrill S.A. Hanson P.I. Activation of human VPS4A by ESCRT-III proteins reveals ability of substrates to relieve enzyme autoinhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35428-35438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 47.Azmi I.F. Davies B.A. Xiao J. Babst M. Xu Z. Katzmann D.J. ESCRT-III family members stimulate Vps4 ATPase activity directly or via Vta1.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 50-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was the case for Vfa1, we used the Malachite green ATPase assay (41.Chang L. Bertelsen E.B. Wisén S. Larsen E.M. Zuiderweg E.R. Gestwicki J.E. High-throughput screen for small molecules that modulate the ATPase activity of the molecular chaperone DnaK.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to examine how Vfa1 might affect the ATPase activity of Vps4 (Fig. 3). As a control, the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not stimulate the ATPase activity of Vps4. Vta1, a known positive regulator of Vps4, was able to increase the rate of Vps4 ATP hydrolysis 3-fold when added in a 1:2 ratio. In comparison, the addition of Vfa1 in a similar ratio increased the Vps4 ATPase activity approximately 10-fold as compared with the intrinsic activity of Vps4, although Vfa1 itself had no ATPase activity. Vfa1 therefore appeared to be a much more potent activator of Vps4 than Vta1. To examine whether this stimulation was dependent on the site of interaction that we identified, we also included Vfa1(1–186) in the Vps4 ATPase assay. No stimulation was seen upon"

Caenorhabditis elegans DEG/ENaC MEC-4 is hyperactivated by the (d) mutation and induces death of touch neurons. The analogous substitution in MEC-10 (MEC-10(d)) co-expressed in the same neurons is only mildly neurotoxic. We exploited the lower toxicity of MEC-10(d) to identify RNAi knockdowns that enhance neuronal death. We report here that knock-out of the C. elegans nicalin homolog NRA-2 enhances MEC-10(d)-induced neuronal death. Cell biological assays in C. elegans neurons show that NRA-2 controls the distribution of MEC-10(d) between the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell surface. Electrophysiological experiments in Xenopus oocytes support this notion and suggest that control of channel distribution by NRA-2 is dependent on the subunit composition. We propose that nicalin/NRA-2 functions in a quality control mechanism to retain mutant channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, influencing the extent of neuronal death. Mammalian nicalin may have a similar role in DEG/ENaC biology, therefore influencing pathological conditions like ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2027399412,"Meiosis requires copper to undertake its program in which haploid gametes are produced from diploid precursor cells. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, copper is transported by three members of the copper transporter (Ctr) family, namely Ctr4, Ctr5, and Ctr6. Although central for sexual differentiation, very little is known about the expression profile, cellular localization, and physiological contribution of the Ctr proteins during meiosis. Analysis of gene expression of ctr4(+) and ctr5(+) revealed that they are primarily expressed in early meiosis under low copper conditions. In the case of ctr6(+), its expression is broader, being detected throughout the entire meiotic process with an increase during middle- and late-phase meiosis. Whereas the expression of ctr4(+) and ctr5(+) is exclusively dependent on the presence of Cuf1, ctr6(+) gene expression relies on two distinct regulators, Cuf1 and Mei4. Ctr4 and Ctr5 proteins co-localize at the plasma membrane shortly after meiotic induction, whereas Ctr6 is located on the membrane of vacuoles. After meiotic divisions, Ctr4 and Ctr5 disappear from the cell surface, whereas Ctr6 undergoes an intracellular re-location to co-localize with the forespore membrane. Under copper-limiting conditions, disruption of ctr4(+) and ctr6(+) results in altered SOD1 activity, whereas these mutant cells exhibit substantially decreased levels of CAO activity mostly in early- and middle-phase meiosis. Collectively, these results emphasize the notion that Ctr proteins exhibit differential expression, localization, and contribution in delivering copper to SOD1 and Cao1 proteins during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1980589621,"TRPC4 proteins function as Ca(2+) conducting, non-selective cation channels in endothelial, smooth muscle, and neuronal cells. To further characterize the roles of TRPC4 in vivo, detailed information about the molecular composition of native channel complexes and their association with cellular signaling networks is needed. Therefore, a mouse brain cDNA library was searched for novel TRPC4-interacting proteins using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay. This screen identified Trans-activation Response RNA-binding protein 2 (Tarpb2), a protein that recruits the Dicer complex to Ago2 for microRNA processing and gene silencing. Tarbp2 was found to bind to the C terminus of TRPC4 and TRPC5 and to modulate agonist-dependent TRPC4-induced Ca(2+) entry. A stretch of basic residues within the Tarbp2 protein is required for these actions. Tarbp2 binding to and modulation of TRPC4 occurs in the presence of endogenously expressed Dicer but is no longer detectable when the Dicer cDNA is overexpressed. Dicer activity in crude cell lysates is increased in the presence of Ca(2+), most probably by Ca(2+)-dependent proteolytic activation of Dicer. Apparently, Tarbp2 binding to TRPC4 promotes changes of cytosolic Ca(2+) and, thereby, leads to a dynamic regulation of Dicer activity, essentially at low endogenous Dicer concentrations."
