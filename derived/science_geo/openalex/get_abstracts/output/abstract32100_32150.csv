https://openalex.org/W1492823505,"The immunosuppressive peptide cyclosporin A is a powerful inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent permeability transition in rat liver mitochondria. When swelling is used to monitor the transition, the inhibitor is effective regardless of whether N-ethylmaleimide, Hg2+, WY-14643, t-butyl hydroperoxide, oxalacetate, rhein, phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, or ruthenium red plus uncoupler is used as the inducing agent. Twenty-five to fifty pmol/mg protein of cyclosporin A reduces the swelling response by 50% with complete inhibition obtained at about 150 pmol/mg protein. The compound, which does not inhibit Ca2+ uptake or mitochondrial phospholipase A2, is effective when added before or after the transition promoting agent. These findings, together with the shape of the inhibition dose-response curve, suggest that cyclosporin A essentially titrates a mitochondrial component which is present at 80-90 pmol/mg protein. It is proposed that this component is a solute unselective, regulated pore or a factor involved in controlling such a structure."
https://openalex.org/W1499161051,"We have examined the cell activation-dependent redistribution of the intracellular granule membrane protein GMP-140 of human endothelial cells. By dual-label immunofluorescence, the distribution of GMP-140 within cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells was found to coincide with the distribution of von Willebrand factor (vWF), suggesting that GMP-140 is located in the membranes of vWF-containing storage granules. Stimulation of vWF secretion resulted in an increase in GMP-140 on the cell surface, as detected by increased binding of the monoclonal antibody S12 which recognizes the extracytoplasmic domain of GMP-140. For each agonist tested (histamine, thrombin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and the calcium ionophore A23187) a dose-dependent redistribution of GMP-140 to the endothelial surface was observed which closely paralleled the dose-dependent secretion of vWF into the cell supernatant. When cells were maximally stimulated by histamine in the presence of antibody S12, a 4-fold increase in S12 uptake by the cells was observed. This increase occurred rapidly and reached a plateau by 10 min. In contrast, when histamine-stimulated cells were first fixed with paraformaldehyde or chilled to 4 degrees C before addition of antibody S12, only a transient increase in cell surface GMP-140 was detected. Under these conditions of arrested membrane turnover during antibody binding, cell surface GMP-140 was maximal 3 min after histamine stimulation and then declined to control levels by 20 min. These data suggest that stimulated secretion of vWF from endothelial cells entails fusion of vWF-containing storage granules with the plasma membrane. Once inserted into the plasma membrane, GMP-140 is subsequently removed from the endothelial surface, most likely by an endocytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1970107043,"Three sets of conserved nucleotides in 23 rRNA are protected from chemical probes by binding of tRNA to the ribosomal A, P, and E sites, respectively. They are located almost exclusively in domain V, primarily in or adjacent to the loop identified with the peptidyl transferase function. Some of these sites are also protected by antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, which could explain how these drugs interfere with protein synthesis. Certain tRNA-dependent protections are abolished when the 3'-terminal A or CA or 2',3'-linked acyl group is removed, providing direct evidence for the interaction of the conserved CCA terminus of tRNA with 23S rRNA. When the EF-Tu.GTP.aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex is bound to the ribosome, no tRNA-dependent A site protections are detected in 23S rRNA until EF-Tu is released. Thus, EF-Tu prevents interaction of the 3' terminus of the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA with the peptidyl transferase region of the ribosome during anticodon selection, thereby permitting translational proofreading."
https://openalex.org/W1513904594,"The role of glycoprotein IV (GPIV) in platelet activation processes has been examined by several different approaches: (i) Fab fragments of a monospecific polyclonal antibody to purified platelet GPIV (approximately 20 micrograms/ml) completely inhibited platelet shape change, aggregation, and secretion induced by collagen. Aggregation and secretion by ADP (but not shape change) and by epinephrine were also inhibited, but there was no effect on platelet activation induced by thrombin, arachidonate, or ionophore A23187. (ii) Purified GPIV was able to compete completely with membrane-bound GPIV to inhibit platelet activation induced by collagen, including shape change, but not in activation induced by any of the other platelet agonists. 50% inhibition of collagen-induced activation and secretion were obtained at GPIV concentrations of approximately 10 nM (1 micrograms/ml). (iii) Purified GPIV bound rapidly and reversibly to collagen Type I fibrils, and binding was not inhibited by adhesive proteins such as denatured collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, or von Willebrand factor. The direct binding of purified GPIV to collagen Type I fibrils fit best to a single site model with Kd 0.34 +/- 0.10 nM. (iv) Using a microtiter assay, platelet adhesion to collagen was shown to be inhibited by Fab fragments of monospecific polyclonal anti-GPIV antibodies, but adhesion to other adhesive proteins was unaffected. (v) When anti-GPIV was added at various times during adhesion the time dependence of inhibition was seen to be biphasic. Anti-GP antibody was able to reverse adhesion that occurred within the first 5-8 min and to inhibit adhesion occurring thereafter. These results demonstrate that GPIV mediates the early stages of platelet recognition by and attachment to collagen but that there may be a second GPIV-independent mechanism that mediates the subsequent anchorage of these adherent platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1636416079,"The Lex determinant (Galβ 1→4[Fucα1→3]GlcNAc-β1→R) has been implicated as having a role in mediating compaction of the mouse embryo at the morula stage (Fenderson, B., Zehavi, U., and Hakomori, S. (1984) J. Exp. Med. 160, 1591–1596). Here, we present evidence suggesting a role for Lex in F9 embryonal carcinoma cell adhesion and a mechanism for Lex recognition based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction. Homotypic aggregation of F9 cells was inhibited by lacto-N-fucopentaose III, and F9 cells showed a preferential interaction with Lex liposomes. The following observations suggest that the structure capable of recognizing Lex per se on F9 cells is Lex: (i) Cell surface-labeled components solubilized in octylglucoside, affinity-bound on an Lex-octyl-Sepharose column, contained glycoproteins reactive with anti-Lex antibody. (ii) Liposomes containing Lex showed significant interaction with Lex glycolipid, but not other glycolipids, coated on a plastic surface. (iii) Liposomes containing Lex glycolipid were found to self-aggregate, whereas liposomes containing paragloboside (nLc4) or sialylparagloboside (IV3NeuAcnLc4) did not. (iv) The diffusibility of 3H-labeled lacto-N-fucopentaitol III (but not I or II), incubated with Lex liposome, from the lower to the upper Boyden chamber through a semipermeable membrane was inhibited. In all these experiments (i-iv), the interaction of Lex to Lex (or Lex to lacto-N-fucopentaose III) was clearly observed only in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and was enhanced by the presence of Mn2+. These interactions were inhibited by EDTA. The results suggest the novel hypothesis that carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions may play an important role in controlling cell recognition during F9 cell aggregation and during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1557940991,"The effect of immune activation of the serum complement system on the secretory response of human endothelial cells was examined. Exposure of antibody sensitized cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells to human serum resulted in secretion of very high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor which coincided with new surface expression of the intracellular granule membrane protein GMP-140. This response required complement activation through deposition of C5b-9 and was not observed with cells exposed to antibody plus C8-deficient serum or to membrane C5b-8 (in the absence of C9). This C5b-9-induced secretion was observed with minimal cell lysis, as assessed by the release of lactic dehydrogenase. Delayed addition of C8 and C9 to cells exposed to antibody plus C8-deficient serum revealed a rapid decay of membrane C8 binding sites accompanied by loss of the secretory response, suggesting a process of removal or inactivation of nascent C5b67 complexes deposited on the endothelial surface. Membrane assembly of C5b-9 complexes caused an increase in endothelial cytosolic [Ca2+], due to influx across the plasma membrane. This C5b-9-dependent increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] and concomitant von Willebrand factor secretion were both abolished by removal of external calcium. In addition to being linked to the level of external Ca2+, the C5b-9-induced secretory response was partially inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor, sphingosine. The capacity of the C5b-9 proteins to stimulate endothelial cells to secrete a platelet adhesive protein provides one mechanism for increased platelet deposition at sites of inflammation, and suggests the potential for other functional changes in endothelium exposed to C5b-9 during intravascular complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W2053905319,"Promonocytic (U1) and T lymphocytic (ACH-2) cell lines chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) constitutively express low levels of virus, but expression can be induced by phorbol esters and cytokines. Whereas ACH-2 cells produce infectious virions, U1 cells produce defective, noninfectious particles. Although 3′-azido-3′-deoxythimidine (AZT) prevented acute HIV infection of susceptible cells, it did not prevent the induction of HIV expression in the infected cell lines. In contrast, interferon alpha (IFN-α) inhibited the release of reverse transcriptase and viral antigens into the culture supernatant after phorbol ester stimulation of both cell lines. Further, IFN-α suppressed the production or release (or both) of whole HIV virions, but had no effect on the amount of cell-associated viral proteins. Also, after phorbol ester stimulation of ACH-2 cells, IFN-α reduced the number of infectious viral particles secreted into the culture supernatant, but had no effect on the infectivity of cell-associated virus. These findings lend support to the combined use of antiviral agents that have action at both the early (AZT) and the late (IFN-α) stages of HIV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2087656195,"We have previously shown that overexpressed chicken pp60c-src has retarded mobility, novel serine/threonine phosphorylation, and enhanced kinase activity during NIH 3T3 cell mitosis. Here we show that novel mitotic phosphorylations occur at Thr 34, Thr 46, and Ser 72. The possibility, previously raised, that Ser 17 is dephosphorylated during mitosis is excluded. The phosphorylated sites lie in consensus sequences for phosphorylation by p34cdc2, the catalytic component of maturation promoting factor (MPF). Furthermore, highly purified MPF from metaphase-arrested Xenopus eggs phosphorylated both wild-type and kinase-defective pp60c-src at these sites. Altered phosphorylation alone is sufficient to account for the large retardation in mitotic pp60c-src electrophoretic mobility: phosphorylation of normal pp60c-src by MPF retarded mobility and dephosphorylation of mitotic pp60c-src restored normal mobility. These results suggest that pp60c-src is one of the targets for MPF action, which may account in part for the pleiotropic changes in protein phosphorylation and cellular architecture that occur during mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2049355608,"As cells enter mitosis, the protein-tyrosine kinase, p60c-src, is known to be extensively phosphorylated on threonine in its amino-terminal region. In the present work, extracts of mitotic cells were searched for the protein kinase responsible for this phosphorylation. HeLa cells and Xenopus eggs were found to contain a mitosis-specific protein kinase activity capable of phosphorylating highly purified p60c-src in vitro on threonine residues. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps indicate that the mitotic HeLa kinase phosphorylates the same sites in vitro as those used during mitosis in vivo. In addition, this mitotic HeLa kinase comigrates on gel filtration with p34cdc2-associated histone H1 kinase, a well known regulator of mitotic events. Finally, antibodies to the C-terminal peptide of human p34cdc2 specifically deplete p60c-src-phosphorylating activity from mitotic extracts. These results suggest that p60c-src may act as an effector of p34cdc2 in certain mitotic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1519857031,"Abstract Platelet glycoprotein IV (GPIV, Mr 88,000), which is immunologically related to the leukocyte differentiation antigen CD36, has been isolated from both intact and trypsinized platelet membranes by a series of steps involving (i) phase partitioning in Triton X-114, (ii) ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, (iii) lectin affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and (iv) size exclusion chromatography on Ultrogel AcA-44. The homogenous product contained 26% carbohydrate (sialic acid, Gal, Man, GalNAc, GlcNAc), of which approximately two-thirds were in alkali-labile O-glycosidic linkages. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified GPIV gave a single band on immunoblot and on immunoprecipitation from solubilized, 3H-labeled platelet membranes indicating its monospecificity. The antibody gave a strongly positive reaction with platelets on flow cytofluorimetry further confirming the surface location of GPIV. Immunoblotting and flow cytometry also identified GPIV-like molecules on the surface of U937, HEL, and C32 cells but not on HT1080 fibroblasts. Amino acid analysis showed values comparable with those deduced from the cloning data for GPIb, GPIIb, and GPIIIa. Automated Edman degradation allowed the identification of the sequence of the first 36 residues of the NH2-terminal domain. G-X-D-R-N-X-G-L-I-A-G-A-V-I-G-A-V- L-A-V-F-G-G-I-L-M-P-V-G-D-L-P-X-Q-K-F. There are no identifiable homologies between the NH2-terminal domain and other known protein sequences. Following a hydrophilic hexapeptide, there is a hydrophobic sequence of 23 amino acids (underlined) that is of the size and composition expected for a transmembrane domain. Since the NH2-terminal domain lacks tyrosine, but GPIV may be readily iodinated in intact platelets, this suggests that GPIV may have a configuration expressing other extramembranous domains."
https://openalex.org/W1481596686,"We have demonstrated previously that chick embryo fibroblasts synthesize and secrete a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (designated PG-M) that binds to fibronectin. We now report the possibility that PG-M interactions with cell surfaces can modulate cell-substrate adhesion. When PG-M was added to the medium, various types of trypsinized cells failed to adhere not only to fibronectin-coated substrates but also to collagen- or vitronectin-coated substrates. Adhesion of the cells to laminin or glycyl-arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine derivatized serum albumin (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid-containing molecules with no capacity to bind PG-M) was also inhibited by PG-M. Treatment of the proteoglycan with either proteolytic enzymes or chondroitinase abolished its inhibitory effects on the cell adhesion. These results suggest that direct binding between PG-M and fibronectin, if any, is not a cause of the inhibition by PG-M and that only the proteoglycan form is responsible for the activity. When the immobilization of added PG-M to available plastic surfaces of coated dishes was blocked by pretreating the dishes with serum albumin, the inhibitory effect of PG-M was abolished, suggesting that the immobilized fraction of PG-M can act as a cell adhesion inhibitor. In immobilized form, both cartilage chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (designated PG-H) and chondroitin sulfate-derivatized serum albumin also inhibited cell adhesion. In contrast, heparan sulfate proteoglycan form LD and heparan sulfate-derivatized serum albumin had far lower inhibitory activities, indicating that the active site for the interaction between cells and PG-M is on the chondroitin sulfate chains."

https://openalex.org/W2082391675,"The intervening sequence of the ribosomal RNA precursor of Tetrahymena is a catalytic RNA molecule, or ribozyme. Acting as a sequence-specific endoribonuclease, it cleaves single-stranded RNA substrates with concomitant addition of guanosine. The chemistry of the reaction has now been studied by introduction of a single phosphorothioate in the substrate RNA at the cleavage site. Kinetic studies show no significant effect of this substitution on kcat (rate constant) or Km (Michaelis constant), providing evidence that some step other than the chemical step is rate-limiting. Product analysis reveals that the reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus, consistent with an in-line, SN2 (P) mechanism. Thus, the ribozyme reaction is in the same mechanistic category as the individual displacement reactions catalyzed by protein nucleotidyltransferases, phosphotransferases, and nucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2033680099,"Translation of ribosomal proteins in the alpha operon of E. coli is repressed by one of the encoded proteins, S4; it specifically recognizes an RNA fragment containing the translational initiation site for the first gene in the operon. RNA structure mapping experiments have suggested a pseudoknot structure for the S4 binding site: the loop of a hairpin is base paired to sequences downstream of the hairpin. Here, we systematically test this proposed structure by measuring S4 binding to an extensive set of site-directed mutations that create compensatory base pair changes in potential helices. The pseudoknot folding is confirmed, and two additional, unexpected interactions within the pseudoknot are also detected. The overall structure is an unusual ""double pseudoknot"" linking a hairpin upstream of the ribosome binding site with sequences 2-10 codons downstream of the initiation codon. Stabilization of this structure by S4 could account for translational repression."
https://openalex.org/W1608448958,"Abstract After incubation with human serum or plasma, 125I-basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (molecular mass 18.5 kDa) exhibits molecular mass forms greater than 200 kDa as determined by nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. These high molecular mass forms of bFGF are immunoprecipitable with antiserum raised against alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M). Purified alpha 2M and 125I-bFGF form a covalent complex in a specific, saturable manner. Excess unlabeled bFGF competes with 125I-bFGF for complex formation. Complex formation is complete after 4 h and is inhibited by pretreating alpha 2M with dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, iodoacetic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide. The complex is resistant to acidic conditions and denaturants such as urea. Heparin, which binds bFGF, has no effect on complex formation. Methylamine, which blocks protease binding to alpha 2M, increases the amount of 125I-bFGF that can be bound 2-fold. Plasmin and trypsin treatment of alpha 2M has no effect on 125I-bFGF binding. The ability of growth factors to compete for binding is specific, as aFGF and TGF-beta compete for binding to alpha 2M, whereas platelet-derived growth factor does not. 125I-bFGF.alpha 2M complexes do not bind to low affinity bFGF binding sites and bind poorly to high affinity bFGF binding sites on BHK-21 cells. In addition, 125I-bFGF bound to alpha 2M has decreased ability to stimulate plasminogen activator production in bovine capillary epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1615286010,"Abstract A virulent strain of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate and studied for binding to glycolipids and to WiDr human colon adenocarcinoma cells. The organism binds strongly to sulfatide and other sulfated glycolipids, such as seminolipid and lactosylsulfatide which all contain terminal Gal(3SO4) beta 1-residues and weakly to some neolactoseries neutral glycolipids. M. pneumoniae do not bind gangliosides including the sialylneolacto-series and other neutral glycolipids that were tested. Only metabolically active M. pneumoniae cells bind to sulfatide, as binding is maximal in RPMI medium at 37 degrees C and almost completely abolished in nutrient-deficient medium or by keeping the cells at 4 degrees C. Dextran sulfate but not other sulfated or anionic polysaccharides at 10 micrograms/ml completely inhibits binding of M. pneumoniae to purified sulfatide. Dextran sulfate does not inhibit binding to the neolacto-series neutral glycolipids. Dextran sulfate partially inhibits adhesion of M. pneumoniae to cultured human colon adenocarcinoma cells (WiDr). The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that sulfatide occurs in large amounts in human trachea, lung, and WiDr cells. Thus, there are at least two distinct receptors that mediate binding of M. pneumoniae to cells: glycolipids containing terminal Gal(3SO4) beta 1-residues as reported here, and glycoproteins containing terminal NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc sequences (Roberts, D. D., Olson, L. D., Barile, M. F., Ginsburg, V., and Krivan, H. C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9289-9293)."

https://openalex.org/W82869603,"Abstract Endothelial cells from brain microvessels form the blood-brain barrier. Brain microvessels and endothelial cells isolated from rat brain microvessels express an amiloride-sensitive cationic channel that was characterized using [3H]phenamil binding and patch-clamp experiments. [3H]Phenamil, a labeled amiloride analog, recognizes a single family of binding sites with a dissociation constant of 20-30 nM and a maximum binding capacity of 8-15 pmol/mg protein. The pharmacological profile of the channel (phenamil greater than benzamil greater than amiloride) is very similar to that of the epithelium Na+ channel of mammalian kidney and of frog epithelia. Long-lasting currents were observed in patch-clamp experiments using excised outside-out patches. Application of amiloride or phenamil first produced a rapid flickering of channel activity and then its complete blockade. The mean unit channel conductance at 140 mM Na+ was 23 picosiemens. The selectivity of Na+ over K+ was estimated from reversal potentials to be 1.5:1. Properties of the channel in microvessels are clearly distinct from those of the Na+ channel of the kidney, suggesting the existence of several isoforms of cationic channels that are sensitive to amiloride and its derivatives. The low selectivity cationic channel of endothelial cells in brain microvessels might be important for controlling both Na+ and K+ movements across the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W1591083466,"Several purified glycoproteins including laminin, fetuin, and human chorionic gonadotropin promote dose-dependent and saturable adhesion of Mycoplasma pneumoniae when adsorbed on plastic. Adhesion to the proteins is energy dependent as no attachment occurs in media without glucose. Adhesion to all of the proteins requires sialic acid, and only those proteins with α 2–3-linked sialic acid are active. The α-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin also promotes attachment, suggesting that a simple biantennary asparagine-linked oligosaccharide is sufficient for binding. Soluble laminin, asparagine-linked sialyloligosaccharides from fetuin, and 3′-sialyllactose but not 6′-sialyllactose inhibit attachment of M. pneumoniae to laminin. M. pneumoniae also bind to sulfatide adsorbed on plastic. Dextran sulfate, which inhibits M. pneumoniae binding to sulfatide, does not inhibit attachment on laminin, and 3′-sialyllactose does not inhibit binding to sulfatide, suggesting that two distinct receptor specificities mediate binding to these two carbohydrate receptors. Both 3′-sialyllactose and dextran sulfate partially inhibit M. pneumoniae adhesion to a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (WiDr) at concentrations that completely inhibit binding to laminin or sulfatide, respectively, and in combination they inhibit binding of M. pneumoniae to these cells by 90%. Thus, both receptor specificities contribute to M. pneumoniae adhesion to cultured human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1553199687,"In this study, several complementary techniques have been used to investigate the involvement of a protein kinase C (PKC) molecule in the plasma membrane-cytoskeleton interactions that occur in mouse T-lymphoma cells. Our data indicate that the lymphoma plasma membrane contains a 78-kDa polypeptide that exists in a complex with one of the major transmembrane glycoproteins, GP85 (a wheat germ agglutinin-binding protein). This membrane-associated 78-kDa protein appears to have PKC-like properties based on the following criteria: 1) it cross-reacts with a specific antibody raised against brain PKC; 2) it has a pI of 5.6-5.8, which is similar to that of the PKC described previously in other cell types; and 3) it displays characteristic PKC enzymatic activity by phosphorylating histone H1 in a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent manner. Double immunocytochemical staining experiments reveal that the lymphoma PKC-like molecules translocate from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane and accumulate directly underneath receptor capped structures following addition of various ligands. Studies we have done to identify the cellular substrate(s) of the lymphoma plasma membrane-associated PKC have shown that GP85 is preferentially phosphorylated in isolated membrane preparations following addition of the PKC activator, TPA (phorbol-12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate), but not the biologically inactive TPA analogue, 4 alpha-PDD (4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate). In addition, we have found that GP85 can be phosphorylated by purified brain protein kinase C. Analysis of the resulting phosphoamino acids indicates that phosphorylation of GP85 occurs primarily at serine residues, occurs in minor amounts (approximately 5%) at threonine residues, and does not occur at tyrosine residues. These data indicate that the lymphoma GP85 is a substrate for PKC. Furthermore, we have established that phosphorylation of GP85 by PKC enhances its binding affinity with the membrane linker molecule, ankyrin. These findings suggest that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GP85 may be an important part of the lymphoma plasma membrane-cytoskeleton interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1548930741,"Abstract Desmoplakins I and II (DP1 and DP2), major cytoskeletal structural proteins concentrated in desmosomes, have been purified in milligram quantities from keratomed pig tongue epithelium. DP1 and DP2 extracted from purified desmosomes in 4 M urea were chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose and remained soluble after removal of urea during subsequent chromatography. The two proteins differed by only about 15% in molecular weight (Mr = 285,000 for DP1 and 225,000 for DP2 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels) were found to have similar Svedberg constants, 6.7 S (DP1) and 6.4 S (DP2); nevertheless, separation was readily achieved by gel filtration, since DP1 has a Stokes radius (Rs) of 164 nm, but DP2 has a Rs = 90 nm. Calculated molecular mass was 462,000 daltons for DP1 and 242,000 daltons for DP2, suggesting that DP1 may be a dimer in solution and DP2 a monomer. Cross-linking by disuccinimidyl suberate of 125I-labeled DP1 or DP2 at nanomolar concentrations confirmed that DP1 is a dimer by doubling of its apparent Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and indicated that DP2, which failed to become cross-linked, is a monomer. DP1 in the presence of 8 M urea could not be cross-linked, indicating that urea dissociated the dimers. Calculated frictional ratios (f/f0 = 3 for DP1 and 2 for DP2) indicate that both proteins are highly asymmetric. Rotary shadowing of DP1 demonstrated flexible dumbbell-like extended shapes with a maximal length of about 180 nm with a central rod and coiled or folded end domains. DP2 showed variable extended shapes of maximal length of 78-93 nm. The increased length and Rs of desmoplakin I is probably accounted for by formation of tail-to-tail dimers. Two-dimensional peptide maps and amino acid analysis showed very similar profiles for the two proteins. Purified keratin filaments failed to bind DP1 or DP2, and prekeratins polymerized in vitro and sedimented failed to remove desmoplakins, suggesting that desmoplakins do not bind keratins directly. These studies provide a basis for functional and detailed structural studies with purified native desmosomal proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2001583897,"The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has been used to measure properties of poly(rA).poly(rU) and DNA, such as helical pitch, half-period oscillations that were interpreted as the alternation between the major and minor grooves, and interhelical spacing. Average pitches were measured by two-dimensional Fourier transforms and by topographic profiles along the fiber axes. Values were typically 7 percent less than standard dimensions of A-form RNA and B-form DNA fibers. This result is compatible with the mild dehydration that occurred under air-drying conditions. More extensive dehydration typically led to 19 percent shrinkage. Analysis of specific regions allowed local variations in helical pitch as small as 1 angstrom to be detected, thus demonstrating that the STM can visualize functionally significant modulations of nucleic acid structure."
https://openalex.org/W1558391881,"The high heparin affinity subtype C of the secretory enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) exists in the body mainly complexed with extracellular sulfated glycosaminoglycans (SGAGs). Addition of sulfated polysaccharides to EC-SOD C resulted in a prompt partial inhibition of the enzymic activity, in most cases amounting to 10-17%, but with the large dextran sulfate 500,000 amounting to 35%. Complex formation between heparin and EC-SOD C could also be observed as increases in apparent molecular weight of the enzyme. The findings suggest that the binding sites for SGAGs on EC-SOD C are localized far from the active site and that EC-SOD in vivo associated with SGAGs should retain the major part of its enzymic activity. Studies with amino acid-specific reagents suggested that both lysine and arginine residues are involved in the binding of SGAGs. In particular, modification of only a few lysine residues/subunit resulted in loss of high SGAG affinity, whereas arginine modification resulted in loss of not only SGAG affinity but also enzymic activity. We propose that this is due to modification of Arg-186, which is homologous to the highly conserved arginine in the entrance to the active site of the copperzinc-SODs."
https://openalex.org/W1819493390,"Abstract Alginate-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa are usually associated with the cystic fibrosis lung environment and contribute to the high mortality rates observed among these patients. The present paper describes the purification and enzymatic properties of guanosine diphospho-D-mannose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.132), a key enzyme in alginate biosynthesis by mucoid P. aeruginosa. The enzyme was overproduced using a plasmid vector containing algD (the gene encoding this enzyme) under control of the tac promoter. It was purified from cell-free lysates by lowering the pH to 5.0, heating the extract to 57.5 degrees C for 10 min, and discarding the protein pellet. The enzyme was selectively precipitated from the supernatant fraction with 45% acetone, resuspended in a 100 mM triethanolamine acetate buffer, pH 7.6, and ultimately purified by Bio-Sil TSK-400 gel filtration chromatography. The subunit molecular weight (Mr 48,000) as well as the N-terminal amino acid sequence corresponded to those predicted from the DNA sequence of algD. The native protein migrated as a hexamer of 290,000 molecular weight upon Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration chromatography. Kinetic analysis demonstrated an apparent Km of 14.9 microM for the substrate GDP-D-mannose and 185 microM for the cofactor NAD+. GDP-D-mannuronic acid was identified as the enzyme reaction product. Several compounds (including GMP, ATP, GDP-D-glucose, and maltose) were found to inhibit enzymatic activity. GMP, the most potent of these inhibitors, exhibited competitive inhibition with an apparent Ki of 22.7 microM. Enzyme activity was also sensitive to the sulfhydryl group modifying agents iodoacetamide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The addition of excess dithiothreitol restored enzyme activity, suggesting a possible involvement of cysteine residues in enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1534764029,"Abstract The homologous proteinase inhibitors, human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and chicken ovostatin, have been compared with respect to their region sequences and interactions with two human matrix metalloproteinases, collagenase and stromelysin. A stretch of 34 amino acid residues of the ovostatin bait region sequence was determined and the matrix metalloproteinase cleavage sites identified. Collagenase cleaved a X-Leu bond where X was unidentified, whereas the major cleavage site by stromelysin was at the Gly-Phe bond, 4 residues on the COOH-terminal side of the collagenase cleavage site. Collagenase cleaved the alpha 2M bait region at the Gly679-Leu680 bond, and stromelysin at Gly679-Leu680 and Phe684-Tyr685 bonds. Sequence similarity in the bait region of members of the alpha-macroglobulin family is strikingly low. The kinetic studies indicate that alpha 2M is a 150-fold better substrate for collagenase than type I collagen. Structural predictions based on the bait region sequences suggest that a collagen-like triple helical structure is not a prerequisite for the efficient binding of tissue collagenase to a substrate. The binding of stromelysin to alpha 2M is slower than that of collagenase. Stromelysin reacts with ovostatin even more slowly. Despite the preference of chicken ovostatin for metalloproteinases, human alpha 2M, a far less selective inhibitor, reacts more rapidly with collagenase and stromelysin. These results suggest that alpha 2M may play an important role in regulating the activities of matrix metalloproteinases in the extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W1543127462,"Abstract This report describes initial efforts to map the ankyrin-binding site of the cytoplasmic domain of the human erythrocyte anion exchanger. The conclusions are that this site is likely to involve a fairly extended sequence in the midregion of the cytoplasmic domain and requires interactions that are not provided by isolated peptides. The region of the sequence involving residues 174-186 is likely to participate in the ankyrin-binding site based on several experiments. Limited tryptic cleavage in the midregion of the cytoplasmic domain (residues 174 and/or 181) nearly abolished the ability of the cytoplasmic domain to inhibit binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger. Ankyrin protected the cytoplasmic domain from tryptic digestion. Finally, peptide-specific antibodies against the sequence encompassing the site(s) of tryptic cleavage (residues 174-186) blocked binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger. However, the sequence comprising the tryptic site is not sufficient for high affinity binding of ankyrin. A 39-amino acid peptide (residues 161-200) that includes the tryptic cleavage site(s) was inactive in inhibiting binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger. Further evidence for a complex ankyrin-binding site is that peptide-specific antibodies against two different, noncontiguous regions (residues 118-162 and 174-186) both inhibited binding of ankyrin to the anion exchanger and were only 10-20% as effective as antibody against the entire cytoplasmic domain. Finally, the ankyrin-binding site of the anion exchanger did not renature following sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose paper even though spectrin did recover ability to bind ankyrin under the same conditions. Thus, the ankyrin-binding site is not defined by a short continuous sequence. A simple consensus sequence for ankyrin-binding regions in other proteins is not likely."
https://openalex.org/W2080979551,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are polymorphic in mouse and man. The products of these genes are receptors for peptides, which while bound, are displayed to T lymphocytes. When bound peptides from antigens are recognized by T lymphocytes, an immune response is initiated against the antigens. This study assessed the relation of the polymorphic MHC molecules to their peptide specificity. The results indicate that although an individual of the species has a limited ability to recognize antigens, the species as a whole has broad reactivity. This rationalizes the extreme polymorphism observed."
https://openalex.org/W1551462273,"Abstract Studies on the mode of action of galanin to inhibit insulin release in RINm5F cells have shown that basal and glyceraldehyde-stimulated release were both inhibited. Galanin was inhibitory at concentrations in the low nanomolar range. Binding studies with 125I-labeled galanin indicated that the RINm5F cells exhibit a single set of sites estimated to be of the order of 30,000 sites/cell. Displacement of 125I-galanin by galanin from the receptor sites occurred over a similar concentration range to that which inhibited insulin release. Half-displacement was achieved with 2 nM galanin. Measurements of bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate) trimethineoxonol (bis-oxonol) fluorescence showed that galanin hyperpolarized the RINm5F cell plasma membrane. Measurements of intracellular free calcium, [Ca2+]i by means of the fluorescent indicator fura-2 showed that galanin decreased [Ca2+]i. As galanin did not inhibit either basal or glyceraldehyde-stimulated insulin release in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nitrendipine, the hyperpolarization and reduction of Ca2+ entry appear to be a possible explanation for the galanin effects. However, quantitatively, the effects on membrane potential and [Ca2+]i appear to be insufficient to account for the potent inhibition of insulin release. Furthermore, evidence for an additional mechanism of action was obtained from experiments with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a phorbol ester which stimulates insulin secretion by at least two mechanisms, one Ca2+ dependent and one Ca2+ independent. TPA-stimulated insulin release was inhibited by galanin over the same concentration range as for the inhibition of glyceraldehyde-stimulated release. Galanin inhibited TPA-stimulated release in the presence of maximally effective concentrations of nitrendipine and in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. These effects cannot be explained by hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and consequent reduction of Ca2+ entry via the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. One suggested mechanism for the action of galanin is inhibition of adenylate cyclase. However, it was found that galanin inhibits insulin release even in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP, an agent which effectively bypasses adenylate cyclase. Therefore, an additional mechanism for the inhibitory effect of galanin must be present. All of the effects of galanin were sensitive to pertussis toxin. These data suggest two G-protein-dependent actions of galanin, one to hyperpolarize the plasma membrane and one at a distal point in stimulus-secretion coupling, close to the exocytotic event."
https://openalex.org/W152006460,"Seven Tyr-protein phosphatase activities were isolated from bovine brain using phosphotyrosyl-casein as a model substrate. The activities were resolved from the cytosolic fraction by a three-step procedure employing successive DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and gel permeation chromatography steps. The seven activities accounted for 70% of the Tyr-protein phosphatase activity in bovine brain extracts and were distinct from type 1 and type 2 Ser/Thr-protein phosphatases and from the major alkaline phosphatase activities. Apparent molecular weights of the activities by gel permeation chromatography were: phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase (PTP)-1A (Mr 86,000), PTP-1B (Mr 24,000), PTP-2 (Mr 88,000), PTP-3 (Mr 90,000), PTP-4 (Mr 80,000), PTP-5 (Mr 48,000), and PTP-6 (Mr 104,000). PTP-5 was the major activity accounting for 26% of total while the remaining activity was divided rather evenly among the other six activities. PTP-5 was further purified to near homogeneity by additional chromatographies on Affi-Gel Blue, heparin-agarose, and Mono S giving an overall purification of 50,000-fold and a yield of 5.8%. One of two major polypeptides (Mr 46,000) in the preparation was identified as PTP-5 since it alone expressed protein phosphatase activity when protein-staining bands were eluted from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and renatured. PTP-5 had a neutral pH optimum, and using phosphotyrosyl-casein as substrate it had a Km of 130 nM and a Vmax of 10 mumol Pi released.min-1.mg protein-1. These kinetic parameters are well within the range of values obtained for other pure protein phosphatases. PTP-5 also dephosphorylated pp60v-src (autophosphorylated at Tyr-416) at 10% of the rate observed with phosphotyrosyl-casein. Additionally the ratio of phosphotyrosyl-casein/pp60v-src phosphatase activity was relatively constant throughout the PTP-5 purification procedure. These results indicate that PTP-5 is able to bind and efficiently dephosphorylate phosphotyrosyl-proteins and suggest that it is a physiologically relevant Tyr-protein phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1519032693,"Abstract Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) exhibits a strong sensitivity to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), a substrate-binding site directed reagent for DNA polymerases (Modak, M. J. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 3620-3626). Treatment of HIV-RT with PLP followed by sodium borohydride reduction of the enzyme-PLP adduct results in irreversible inactivation of polymerase activity while RNase H activity associated with HIV-RT is minimally affected. Kinetic studies indicate that the PLP inhibition is complex. Yet one of the sites of PLP action appears to be involved in the process of dNTP binding as judged by (a) competitive mode of inhibition and (b) blockage of PLP into enzyme protein by the addition of substrate dNTP. Furthermore, this site is the only PLP reactive site which is accessible to borohydride reduction. Comparative tryptic peptide mapping of enzyme treated with PLP under a variety of conditions permitted the identification of a PLP reactive site containing peptide. Furthermore, reactivity of this site was also blocked by inclusion of substrate dNTP and appropriate template-primer. The amino acid composition and sequence analysis of this peptide showed that a lysine residue present at position 263 in the primary amino acid sequence of HIV-RT is the site of PLP reactivity. We therefore conclude that lysine 263 serves as an important part of the dNTP-binding domain in HIV-RT."
https://openalex.org/W1512008456,"The rate of movement of different receptors and ligands through the intracellular endocytic apparatus was studied in alveolar macrophages. Cells were exposed to iodinated alpha-macroglobulin-protease complexes, mannose terminal glycoproteins, diferric transferrin, and maleylated proteins. By use of the diaminobenzidine density shift procedure, we demonstrated that these ligands were internalized into the same endocytic vesicle. We then compared the rates of transfer to the lysosome or recycling to the cell surface of different ligands/receptors contained in the same endosome. We found that although the rate constant for degradation was ligand specific, the lag time prior to the initiation of degradation was the same for all three ligands. We also found that molecules taken up nonspecifically by fluid-phase pinocytosis had the same lag time prior to degradation as ligands internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. These data suggest that different molecules within the same endocytic compartment are transferred to the lysosome (or degradative compartment) at the same rate. We measured the rate of return of receptors to the cell surface by either inactivating surface receptors by protease treatment at 0 degrees C, or by incubating cells with saturating amounts of nonradioactive ligand at 37 degrees C. We then measured the rate of appearance of new receptors on the cell surface. Using these approaches, we found that three different receptors were transferred from internal pools to the cell surface at the same rate. The rate of transfer was independent of whether receptors were initially occupied or unoccupied. Our observations indicate that receptor/ligands, once inside alveolar macrophages, are transported by vesicles which transfer their contents as a cohort from one compartment to another. The rate of movement of these receptors is determined by the movement of vesicles and is independent of their content."
https://openalex.org/W1549866445,"Abstract Methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (EC 6.3.3.2) catalyzes the irreversible ATP and Mg2+-dependent transformation of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (N5-HCO-H4-pteroylglutamic acid (PteGlu] to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. The physiological function of this reaction remains unknown even though it is potentially involved in the intracellular metabolism of the large doses of N5-HCO-H4-PteGlu (leucovorin) administered to cancer patients. We have tried to elucidate methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase's physiological role by examining the consequences of its inhibition in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by the folate analog 5-formyltetrahydrohomofolate (fTHHF), a potent competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 1.4 microM. fTHHF inhibited MCF-7 cell growth with an IC50 of 2.0 microM during 72-h exposures, and this effect was fully reversible by hypoxanthine but not thymidine, indicating specific inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. A correlation was observed between increases in intracellular N5-HCO-H4-PteGlu concentrations following fTHHF and cell growth inhibition. De novo purine synthesis was inhibited at the second folate-dependent enzyme, phosphoribosyl aminoimidazole-carboxamide formyltransferase (AICAR transferase; EC 2.1.2.3), as determined by aminoimidazole carboxamide rescue and azaserine inhibition studies. N5-HCO-H4-PteGlu pentaglutamate was a potent inhibitor of purified MCF-7 cell AICAR transferase with a Ki of 3.0 microM while the monoglutamate was not an inhibitor up to 10 microM and fTHHF was only weakly inhibitory with a Ki of 16 microM. These findings suggest that methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity is needed to prevent de novo purine synthesis inhibition by N5-HCO-H4-PteGlu polyglutamates."

DNA isolated from human fat tissue, when transfected into 3T3-C2 mouse cells, also gives rise to mouse transfectants that are induced to differentiate into adipocytes by the addition of insulin.

https://openalex.org/W1596082331,"High cell density and cell cycle withdrawal stimulate the differentiation of BC3H1 smooth muscle-like cells. The differentiation process is accompanied by extensive changes in cell shape and the increased expression of a variety of muscle-specific proteins including the vascular smooth muscle-specific isoform of the contractile protein, alpha-actin. Results of actin peptide map analyses described in this report now indicate that a second, sarcomeric muscle-specific alpha-actin isoform is expressed in serum-deprived BC3H1 myocytes and that the induction of this actin isoform occurs late in differentiation well after the observed upregulation of vascular alpha-actin synthesis. The sarcomeric alpha-actin was identified in myocytes on the basis of the unique electrophoretic mobility of its NH2-terminal tryptic peptide, the distribution of cleavage products that were obtained when the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide was subjected to secondary proteolytic cleavage with thermolysin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and the presence of an additional cysteine residue at the NH2 terminus of the biosynthetic precursor of this novel alpha-actin. While expression of vascular alpha-actin was stimulated when myoblasts reached confluence, a 6-day post-confluent treatment with serum-free medium was required to induce maximal expression of the sarcomeric alpha-actin. Blot hybridization analysis of total BC3H1 myocyte RNA using actin gene-specific cDNA probes indicated that the sarcomeric alpha-actin corresponds to the skeletal muscle-specific isoform. This is the first report describing dual expression of smooth muscle and sarcomeric muscle alpha-actins in a clonal myogenic cell line. The results indicate the potential usefulness of the BC3H1 cell line for studying relationships between divergent muscle alpha-actin gene sequences and transcriptional and translational controls during myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1528418211,"Heterologous regulation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was studied in FS4 human skin fibroblasts. The addition of PDGF to FS4 cells inhibited high affinity binding of 125I-EGF and stimulated phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Phosphopeptide analysis by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that PDGF treatment of cells increased phosphorylation at several distinct sites of the EGF receptor. However, PDGF did not stimulate phosphorylation of threonine 654, a residue previously shown to be phosphorylated when protein kinase C is activated. The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also stimulated phosphorylation of the same peptides from the EGF receptor as PDGF, and, in addition, induced phosphorylation of threonine 654. TPA inhibited both high and low affinity 125I-EGF binding by these cells. PDGF treatment of cells had no effect on EGF-dependent, tyrosine-specific autophosphorylation of the receptor, whereas TPA treatment was inhibitory. TPA, but not PDGF, stimulated phosphorylation of a Mr = 80,000 protein, known to be a substrate for protein kinase C, even though PDGF appeared to mediate breakdown of phosphoinositides. These data suggest that regulation of EGF receptor function by PDGF and TPA are distinct in these cells, even though some elements of regulation are shared. The results differ from those previously reported for a human lung fibroblast isolate, indicating that cell type-specific differences may exist in metabolism of the EGF receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2475148842,"Two Tyr-protein phosphatase inhibitors, termed inhibitor H (Mr greater than 500,000) and inhibitor L (Mr 38,000), have been detected in bovine brain extracts. The inhibitors were partially purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephacryl S-300. Both inhibitors are proteins, as judged by their inactivation by proteinase K, and they exhibited remarkable stability during incubation at 95 degrees C. Of seven Tyr-protein phosphatase activities that we have isolated from bovine brain, PTP-4 and PTP-5 were most sensitive to the inhibitor proteins. Inhibition of the other five Tyr-protein phosphatases was only observed at very high inhibitor concentrations. The IC50 values for the inhibition of PTP-4 by inhibitor H and inhibitor L were 2- and 10-fold higher than those for the inhibition of PTP-5. Inhibition of PTP-5 by either inhibitor was rapid (maximum effect in less than 1 min) and readily reversed upon removal of the inhibitors by dilution. Inhibitor H and inhibitor L are distinct from the three heat-stable protein inhibitors of Ser/Thr-protein phosphatase 1. The ability of inhibitor H and inhibitor L to preferentially inhibit PTP-4 and PTP-5 provides an important new criterion that can be used to distinguish these enzymes from other Tyr-protein phosphatases. The two inhibitor proteins may be involved in regulating the activity of PTP-4 and PTP-5."
https://openalex.org/W2411373411,"Abstract Several well-differentiated human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B) have been used to identify factors which regulate hepatic gene expression during the host response to inflammation/tissue injury (acute phase response). Studies in these cell lines, as well as in primary cultures of rat, rabbit, and mouse hepatocytes, have demonstrated that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and interferon-beta 2 (IFN-beta 2) each mediate changes in expression of several hepatic acute phase genes. In this study we identify a subclone of the HepG2 cell line in which there is a selective defect in IL-1 beta-mediated acute phase gene expression. Recombinant human IL-1 beta mediates an increase in synthesis of the positive acute phase complement protein factor B and a decrease in synthesis of negative acute phase protein albumin in the parent uncloned HepG2 cell line (HG2Y), but not in the subclone HG2N. Recombinant human IFN-beta 2 and TNF-alpha, however, regulate acute phase protein synthesis in the subclone HG2N; i.e. IFN-beta 2 and TNF-alpha increase synthesis of factor B and decrease synthesis of albumin in both HG2Y and HG2N cells. Equilibrium binding analysis with 125I-rIL-1 beta at 4 degrees C showed that both HG2N and HG2Y cells bind IL-1 beta specifically and saturably. HG2N and HG2Y possess 3.8 and 4.0 x 10(3) plasma membrane receptors/cell with affinities of 0.96 and 1.07 x 10(-9) M, respectively. Thus, the defect in this subclone of the HepG2 cell line is likely to involve the signal transduction pathway for the biological activity of IL-1 beta and will be useful in elucidation of this signal transduction pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1535565522,"Abstract The structure of human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) after reaction with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II) (cis-DDP) was studied by electron microscopy. The cis-DDP stabilized a novel conformation of the native inhibitor resembling a doughnut surrounded by two, three, of four well defined spherules. When only two spherules were present, these structures were usually oriented on opposite sides of the doughnut. The protein region joining a spherule to the central structure did not include sufficient mass to exclude stain and was, therefore, invisible. Other images showed spherules that were partially superimposed on the doughnut. A comparison of many molecules suggested great flexibility of the peripheral spherules relative to the central structure. The cis-DDP prevented complete conformational change when the alpha 2M was reacted with trypsin. The products of this reaction included apparent conformational intermediates. These intermediates most closely resembled either native alpha 2M or the well established structure of alpha 2M-proteinase, depending on the initial conditions used to modify the alpha 2 M with cis-DDP. When cis-DDP-treated alpha 2M was reacted with trypsin, purified by chromatography and subsequently treated with diethyldithiocarbamate, complete conformational change was observed. Based on an analysis of the alpha 2M structural intermediates obtained using the chemical modification procedures described here, a new model of alpha 2M conformational change was developed. We postulate that conformational change initially involves contraction of the peripheral spherules towards the central doughnut. These spherules then unfold and elongate in the perpendicular direction to form the lateral walls of the proteinase transformed alpha 2M H structure."
https://openalex.org/W1603057209,"Secretory proteins are synthesized in salivary glands of the insect, Chironomus tentans, and assemble in vivo into silk-like threads which aquatic larvae use to construct tubes for filter feeding and pupation. Thus far, all known secretory protein genes contain repetitious protein-coding sequences and are located in cytological structures known as Balbiani rings, giant puffs found on polytene secretory cell chromosomes. In this paper we describe the identification of another secretory protein gene which is comprised of repeated sequences; however, this gene is not located in a Balbiani ring. Two partial cDNA clones from a 3.6-kilobase pair poly(A)+ RNA were sequenced and found to contain two open reading frames for protein synthesis. Antibodies were raised against synthetic oligopeptides whose sequences were derived from these two open reading frames. An immunoaffinity-purified antibody for one of these peptides bound specifically to a 140-kDa secretory protein (sp140). The cDNA sequences contain tandem repeats of 42 base pairs which encode a repeat of 14 amino acids with a composition and oligopeptide sequence similar to other secretory proteins. The C. tentans genome contains about 70 copies of this 42-base pair repeat organized as a contiguous block of 3 kilobase pairs or less. The sp140 gene was mapped by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosome band I-17-B. Developmental studies of protein accumulation, steady-state levels of mRNA, and relative transcription rate suggested that the sp140 gene is developmentally regulated so that maximal expression is achieved during the prepupal stages of the fourth larval instar. Based upon these results we proposed that sp140 gene belongs to a prepupal class of secretory protein genes. While the sp140 gene shares structural and expression characteristics with other secretory protein genes, its unique chromosomal location shows that this multigene family is not restricted to Balbiani rings."
https://openalex.org/W1957664177,"A series of compounds that induce depletion of ATP and Pi when added to isolated rat hepatocytes were found to cause a remarkable, although transient, elevation in the concentration of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) in these cells. After the addition of 5 mM fructose, xylitol, tagatose, or D-xylulose, PRPP increased from a basal value of 6 +/- 1 nmol/g of cells to, respectively, 68 +/- 11, 42 +/- 11, 67 +/- 22, and 530 +/- 50 nmol/g of cells (means +/- SEM of 3-9 experiments). In each case, the increase in PRPP was preceded by a latency period of 5-10 min. PRPP reached maximal levels 15 min after the addition of fructose and 30 min after that of xylitol and D-xylulose, but continued to increase for as long as 60 min after the addition of tagatose. Most striking was that the increase in PRPP closely paralleled the restoration of intracellular Pi. Ribose 5-P increased about two- to fivefold after the addition of fructose, xylitol, and tagatose, and approximately 12-fold after D-xylulose. The mechanism by which ATP- and Pi-depleting compounds stimulate the activity of PRPP synthetase in isolated rat hepatocytes is discussed."

Two of the derivatives were prepared by protecting Lys-15 by complexation with trypsin or chymotrypsin during acetylation with N-hydroxysuccinimide acetate or guanidination with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole-1-carboxamidine nitrate. A third derivative with a free amino group at the amino terminus was prepared by guanidination of the 4 lysine residues with o-methylisourea. The purity and structural integrity of the modified proteins was checked by NMR spectroscopy. Cysteine-containing peptides can be coupled to the single free amino group using several heterobifunctional linking reagents. N-Succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate is the most satisfactory coupling reagent for NMR studies because of its high specificity. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy shows that the conformation of the modified proteins is almost identical with that of native BPTI. The BPTI derivatives are suitable for use as models for NMR investigations of the conformation of immunogenic peptides conjugated to a carrier protein."

It is in phase I trials. Dextran sulfate obtained from Japan by many AIDS victims also binds HIV in vitro but has not been effective in actual use because it is not absorbed orally. A 3rd type of drug is one that inhibits assembly of viral components. Castanospermine a derivative from the Australian chestnut tree is in phase I trials under the name SC 48334 from G.D. Searle. Another plant compound in this group is hypericin from the St. Johns-wort not yet in clinical trials. A 4th type being investigated may inhibit viral protease enzymes and a 5th type of drug may block viral messenger RNA. Natural human antiviral products such as Imreg-1 interleukin-2 interferons and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor are also being examined as potential aids in bolstering immune function.
