https://openalex.org/W1905278501,"DNA-demethylating agents have shown clinical anti-tumor efficacy via an unknown mechanism of action. Using a combination of experimental and bioinformatics analyses in colorectal cancer cells, we demonstrate that low-dose 5-AZA-CdR targets colorectal cancer-initiating cells (CICs) by inducing viral mimicry. This is associated with induction of dsRNAs derived at least in part from endogenous retroviral elements, activation of the MDA5/MAVS RNA recognition pathway, and downstream activation of IRF7. Indeed, disruption of virus recognition pathways, by individually knocking down MDA5, MAVS, or IRF7, inhibits the ability of 5-AZA-CdR to target colorectal CICs and significantly decreases 5-AZA-CdR long-term growth effects. Moreover, transfection of dsRNA into CICs can mimic the effects of 5-AZA-CdR. Together, our results represent a major shift in understanding the anti-tumor mechanisms of DNA-demethylating agents and highlight the MDA5/MAVS/IRF7 pathway as a potentially druggable target against CICs."

Blended learning is an emerging paradigm for science education but has not been rigorously assessed. We performed a randomized controlled trial of blended learning. We found that in-class problem solving improved exam performance, and video assignments increased attendance and satisfaction. This validates a new model for science communication and education. At the undergraduate level, science is most commonly taught using a lecture and textbook format. In this pedagogical approach, students are assigned a textbook to read at home before class and listen to an instructor lecture on the assigned material during class. Although this approach to learning is effective for some students, it is suboptimal for many undergraduate students and may contribute to students leaving the sciences (Handelsman, 2007Handelsman J. Scientific Teaching. W.H. Freeman and Co., 2007Google Scholar). Recognition of the limitations of the traditional instructional approach to science using a textbook and lecture format has led to suggestions for examining alternative methodologies (Handelsman, 2007Handelsman J. Scientific Teaching. W.H. Freeman and Co., 2007Google Scholar). In recent years, online learning options, including massive open online courses (MOOCs), have become increasingly available as a means to produce learning in students who cannot attend classes in person and have been proposed as alternative learning paradigms (Reich, 2015Reich J. Science. 2015; 347: 34-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the low completion rates of online courses, such as MOOCs, and the importance of instructor-student and student-student interactions in classrooms have suggested that online learning alone is unlikely to be the most effective strategy for teaching and learning (Glazer, 2012Glazer F.S. Blended Learning: Across the Disciplines, across the Academy. Stylus Publishing, 2012Google Scholar, Reich, 2015Reich J. Science. 2015; 347: 34-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the online learning paradigm offers valuable tools that could supplement or replace aspects of the traditional lecture-and-textbook-based approach to teaching and learning (Glazer, 2012Glazer F.S. Blended Learning: Across the Disciplines, across the Academy. Stylus Publishing, 2012Google Scholar). First, pre-class online video assignments may offer advantages over textbook assignments, especially for introductory science courses with complex and dense material that is unfamiliar to beginning students (Kagohara, 2010Kagohara D.M. Dev. Neurorehabil. 2010; 13: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reading a textbook engages mainly visual, language comprehension, and cognitive neural pathways and requires that the reader is able to select the most relevant material for application to the course (Wandell, 2011Wandell B.A. Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2011; 1224: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Video instruction, on the other hand, adds auditory engagement to visual, language comprehension and cognitive processes, and allows for more varied emphasis of the importance of content. Video assignments are typically more engaging for a large introductory science course and may stimulate greater engagement with the course material. In addition, listening to a lecture in class involves mostly recording and recalling information, which are lower levels of Bloom’s taxonomy of learning (Bloom, 1956Bloom B.S. Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Handbook 1: Cognitive Domain. David McKay Company, Inc., 1956Google Scholar). In contrast, solving problems in real time during class forces students to synthesize and apply knowledge as they process it (Amador et al., 2006Amador J.A. Miles L. Peters C.B. The Practice of Problem-Based Learning: A Guide to Implementing PBL in the College Classroom. Anker Pub. Co., 2006Google Scholar). A historical comparison has shown that a structured course with in class problem solving improves performance and reduces the achievement gap (Haak et al., 2011Haak D.C. HilleRisLambers J. Pitre E. Freeman S. Science. 2011; 332: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Moreover, a survey of pre/post-test data in physics courses revealed that interactive teaching improved student learning (Hake, 1998Hake R.R. Am. J. Phys. 1998; 66: 64-74Crossref Scopus (3178) Google Scholar). Finally, low-stakes formative assessments improved exam performance when compared across students in different class sections with different teachers (Roediger et al., 2011Roediger H.L. Agarwal P.K. McDaniel M.A. McDermott K.B. J. Exp. Psychol. Appl. 2011; 17: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, active, problem-based learning may improve student performance on exams (Che et al., 1998Che S. Wu W. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Stukenberg T. Clark R. Kuang J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 225-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, Knight and Wood, 2005Knight J.K. Wood W.B. Cell Biol. Educ. 2005; 4: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We wondered if pre-class video assignments and in-class problem solving would result in increased engagement, satisfaction and more effective learning. While it has been suggested that these techniques in some contexts and in isolation improve learning (Fitzgerald and Li, 2015Fitzgerald N. Li L. J. Chem. Educ. 2015; (Published online March 6, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1021/ed500667Crossref Google Scholar, Freeman et al., 2014Freeman S. Eddy S.L. McDonough M. Smith M.K. Okoroafor N. Jordt H.

Stylus Publishing, 2012Google Scholar, Handelsman, 2007Handelsman J. Scientific Teaching. W.H. Freeman and Co., 2007Google Scholar), studies involving undergraduate science education have generally not been conducted as randomized controlled trials under otherwise identical conditions with the same material and the same instructor. Rather, they have been conducted using different instructors or different course materials, making it difficult to assess if changes seen were due specifically to the teaching methods. We endeavored to rigorously examine whether video-based preparation and in-class problem solving increase student engagement, as indicated by class attendance, and ultimately exam performance, for undergraduate science students. A total of 172 students enrolled in Biochemistry I: Structure and Metabolism, an undergraduate biochemistry course at Columbia University, were invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial in the fall of 2014. A total of 111 students enrolled in the study. We used a two-by-two study design, in which we compared the effects of both video versus textbook pre-class assignments and lecturing with instructor-demonstrated problems versus lecturing with student problem-solving in class. Students were randomized to one of four arms: (1) textbook preparation for lecture, (2) video preparation for lecture, (3) textbook preparation for problem-solving class, or (4) video preparation for problem-solving class (Figure 2). The students were stratified for randomization by gender and prior exam performance (low: lower third versus high: upper two-thirds) into each of the four arms to ensure equal representation of these students in each study arm; 54% of students in the study (60/111) were male (Figure 2). In advance of class, students were provided either a link to a video or a link to a textbook reading, covering the same material, as per their randomization assignment; students were instructed not to review other materials and had little incentive to do so, since the study results were not included in their grade, as participation was voluntary, and since there was no assigned textbook for the course for them to otherwise consult. During class, students either listened to an instructor-delivered lecture or listened to the same lecture material interspersed with instructions to solve problems related to the presented material, again as per their randomization arm. To ensure that the content was the same in each class, the students who attended the lecture were also provided with the same problems and their solutions, but these were explained by the instructor rather than being solved by the students. Thus, the difference between the lecture and problem-solving class formats was not in the content but rather whether the students actively solved the presented problems or were simply told the answers as part of the lecture. All lectures were provided by the same instructor. The first outcome measured was class attendance. Since participation was voluntary, students were able to discontinue participation at any point in the study. We analyzed whether the rate of class attendance after receiving the preparation material was different between the students who received a video versus textbook pre-class assignment. Indeed, we found that more students randomized to the pre-class video assignment attended class (84%, 47/56) compared with those randomized to the textbook assignment (67%, 37/55) (p = 0.04, Pearson’s chi-square test) (Figure 2). In other words, twice as many students chose not to attend class after receiving a textbook assignment (18/55; 32.7%) compared to those who received a video assignment (9/56; 16.1%). This result was consistent with the hypothesis that a video is a more engaging way to present new and complex material to students and stimulates students to be interested in learning more about the topic by attending class. To test this hypothesis, we examined the level of satisfaction among the students with the preparation material. There was significant improvement in satisfaction with the preparation material among the students who received the video assignment (4.3/5.0) compared to students who received a textbook assignment (2.9/5.0) (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) (Figure 2). This is consistent with the fact that fewer students who received the textbook assignment chose to attend class and suggests that textbook preparation for a science class is less satisfactory and engaging for students compared to assignments that involve watching a video. At the end of each class, students took a 20 min online, multiple-choice exam, while still present in class, to test their understanding of the material. First, in order to test whether the exam measured the same performance characteristics found in the rest of the course, we compared exam performance for students with a higher prior exam performance versus a lower one. Indeed, we found that prior exam performance (high versus low) correlated with the study exam performance: the median exam scores for students in the high prior exam group (73/100) was significantly (p = 0.006, Mann Whitney test) greater than the median exam score for students in the low prior exam group (60/100), suggesting that the students exerted their typical effort and exhibited similar performance characteristics, despite the fact that participation was voluntary. We then examined the performance of the four study arms on the end-of-class exam to determine the effects of teaching pedagogy on student performance. We found that the median exam score increased within each arm, from arm 1 (textbook preparation, in-class lecture; 61/100) to arm 2 (video preparation, in-class lecture; 67/100) to arm 3 (textbook preparation, in-class problem solving; 73/100) to arm 4 (video preparation, in-class problem solving; 80/100) (Figure 2). Indeed, the students in the arm that experienced fully blended learning, with video preparation and in class problem solving, had the highest median exam score (80/100). We found that the most significant intervention was the implementation of student-centered problem solving during class, as the median score on the exam was higher for those who were randomized to the lecture-plus-problem-solving class (74/100) compared to those randomized to the lecture-only class, irrespective of preparation material (63/100) (p = 0.03, Mann Whitney test) (Figure 2). We also compared the exam scores of students in the textbook versus video preparation groups but found no statistically significant difference in this relatively modest sample size, despite the trend toward higher scores in the group that received the video assignment. We recognized that the instructor in a randomized controlled trial may exhibit unconscious bias. We sought to measure this objectively by evaluating student satisfaction with the lecture and problem-solving classes. Student satisfaction did not differ significantly between students who attended the problem-solving versus lecture classes (4.1 versus 4.1, out of 5.0, p = 0.99, Mann-Whitney test) (Figure 2). This suggests that the traditional lecture was engaging and of high quality and that the difference in exam performance was not due to unconscious instructor bias in the delivery of the lecture material. Moreover, it suggests that student satisfaction alone is not a reliable indicator of learning gains and that institutions and instructors should be cautious in evaluating pedagogical methods using only student satisfaction measures, which are the typical metrics used in course evaluations. Indeed, objective measures of learning gains may ultimately be the most accurate means of assessing courses. Overall, we conclude that providing students with problems to solve during class results in significantly improved exam performance, compared to simply having the instructor describe the same problems and their solutions during the course of the lecture. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in improving science education to increase the diversity of individuals who choose science careers and to broaden the pool of scientifically literate citizens globally. The traditional textbook-and-lecture approach to teaching undergraduate science, while effective for a subset of individuals, is not the most effective means of stimulating learning in the broadest group of students. We and others have sought to examine the effectiveness of an alternative pedagogy that replaces textbooks with video assignments and traditional lecturing with active, student-centered problem solving. One result of this trial was that students who received a video assignment were both more likely to attend class and to rate their assignment as providing a higher degree of satisfaction, compared to students who received a textbook assignment. Thus, in this study, video assignments were more effective at stimulating student interest and engagement with the course material. Therefore, providing supplemental videos for science courses, either in place of, or in addition to, textbook assignments, may enhance student engagement and motivation. A second finding was that students who listened to a traditional instructor-focused lecture underperformed students who actively solved problems during the class period. This was despite the fact that the students in these two groups rated their classes as equally satisfying. Thus, while students enjoyed passively listening to a lecture as much as being asked to solve problems during class, they learned the material better when they actively worked on problems, rather than simply being given the problems and answers as part of the lecture. Therefore, instructors may wish to provide frequent opportunities during class for students to apply the content presented to specific problems. This provides ongoing formative assessments for students to test their learning and refocuses student attention during an otherwise extended period of lecturing. In addition, asking a student to apply knowledge to new contexts may assist them in learning the material in a more effective way that allows them to extrapolate the knowledge to new situations in the future; a related case-based pedagogy has been used successfully in business, medical, and law schools. One of the difficulties faced when trying to rigorously assess the effectiveness of teaching and learning strategies is the challenge of delivering identical content via the same instructor and same pool of students such that it is the teaching method that is being assessed and not other factors. A variety of strategies have attempted with limited success to deal with this challenge, such as historical comparisons among the students who take a particular class that has altered its methodology, comparisons among instructors who use different teaching methodologies, or comparisons among the same instructor using different teaching methodologies within one course but for different topics and at different points of time in the semester. We suggest that it is most effective to use the rigor and methodology of randomized controlled trials, which are able to measure the impact of patient interventions in health and biomedicine, to examine the impact of teaching approaches on student learning (Drits-Esser et al., 2014Drits-Esser D. Bass K.M. Stark L.A. CBE Life Sci. Educ. 2014; 13: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). By using the same content, the same instructor, the same point of time, and the same pool of students randomized to different conditions, we were able to minimize the impact of variables beyond the ones we sought to measure. In addition, the trial was conducted in a pragmatic fashion with students within their usual course with their usual peers and instructor and is therefore reflective of results in a real-world setting. It also demonstrates the feasibility of conducting such pragmatic education trials. Unfortunately, we were only able to examine the effects of teaching style in one class. Additionally, we did not examine the long-term effect of these interventions on learning; it would be valuable to have students take another exam several months or even years after participating in the study to examine how well they retain the information. We propose that such longitudinal assessments of learning gains could be organized at the institutional level by regularly administering follow-up exams to students in specific majors who have completed the same required courses early in their program. Perhaps by coupling such programs with a compensation system for participation, the long-term impact of course structures and pedagogical methods could be assessed. Overall, the results from this trial suggest that a blended teaching approach, which uses video assignments in advance of each class to stimulate interest in the topic and provide foundational knowledge, coupled with lectures having in-class problem solving, is a more effective strategy for science education compared with traditional approaches. It is worth noting that video assignments did not improve student exam performance on their own but did increase attendance and satisfaction. By providing foundational information pre-class, video assignments can also create time in class for active learning, such as student problem solving. Thus, video pre-class assignments can serve a critical role in the blended learning paradigm for education. These results also illustrate the feasibility of using the clinical trial methodology in educational intervention evaluations. Blended learning approaches may help students learn information in a way that they can then translate to novel situations they will encounter in their academic and professional careers, which is the hallmark of effective learning. Institutions and instructors may wish to consider how to support blended learning paradigms in their science curricula.

In order to understand the effect of total fishmeal replacement by vegetable-based feed in the sea bream (Sparus aurata), the microbial composition of the stomach, foregut, midgut and hindgut was analysed using high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing, also considering parameters of growth, survival and nutrient utilisation indices.A total of 91,539 16S rRNA filtered-sequences were analysed, with an average number of 3661.56 taxonomically assigned, high-quality sequences per sample. The dominant phyla throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract were Actinobacteria, Protebacteria and Firmicutes. A lower diversity in the stomach in comparison to the other intestinal sections was observed. The microbial composition of the Recirculating Aquaculture System was totally different to that of the sea bream gastrointestinal tract. Total fishmeal replacement had an important impact on microbial profiles but not on diversity. Streptococcus (p-value: 0.043) and Photobacterium (p-value: 0.025) were highly represented in fish fed with fishmeal and vegetable-meal diets, respectively. In the stomach samples with the vegetable diet, reads of chloroplasts and mitochondria from vegetable dietary ingredients were rather abundant. Principal Coordinate Analysis showed a clear differentiation between diets in the microbiota present in the gut, supporting the presence of specific bacterial consortia associated with the diet.Although differences in growth and nutritive parameters were not observed, a negative effect of the vegetable diet on the survival rate was determined. Further studies are required to shed more light on the relationship between the immune system and sea bream gastrointestinal tract microbiota and should consider the modulation of the microbiota to improve the survival rate and nutritive efficacy when using plant-based diets."

Results showed long-term continuous cropping led to a significant decline in soil pH, organic matter contents, enzymatic activities, and resulted in a decrease in soil bacterial abundance. 454 pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes revealed that the Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria were the main phyla in the replanted black pepper orchard soils, comprising up to 73.82% of the total sequences; the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla decreased with long-term continuous cropping; and at genus level, the Pseudomonas abundance significantly depleted after 21 years continuous cropping. In addition, bacterial diversity significantly decreased after 55 years black pepper continuous cropping; obvious variations for community structures across the 3 time-scale replanted black pepper orchards were observed, suggesting monoculture duration was the major determinant for bacterial community structure. Overall, continuous cropping during black pepper cultivation led to a significant decline in soil pH, organic matter contents, enzymatic activities, resulted a decrease in soil bacterial abundance, and altered soil microbial community membership and structure, which in turn resulted in black pepper poor growth in the continuous cropping system."
https://openalex.org/W2174376136,"Cities are recognised as key players in global adaptation and mitigation efforts because the majority of people live in cities. However, in Europe, which is highly urbanized and one of the most advanced regions in terms of environmental policies, there is considerable diversity in the regional distribution, ambition and scope of climate change responses. This paper explores potential factors contributing to such diversity in 200 large and medium-sized cities across 11 European countries. We statistically investigate institutional, socio-economic, environmental and vulnerability characteristics of cities as potential drivers of or barriers to the development of urban climate change plans. Our results show that factors such as membership of climate networks, population size, GDP per capita and adaptive capacity act as drivers of mitigation and adaptation plans. By contrast, factors such as the unemployment rate, warmer summers, proximity to the coast and projected exposure to future climate impacts act as barriers. We see that, overall, it is predominantly large and prosperous cities that engage in climate planning, while vulnerable cities and those at risk of severe climate impacts in the future are less active. Our analysis suggests that climate change planning in European cities is not proactive, i.e. not significantly influenced by anticipated future impacts. Instead, we found that the current adaptive capacity of a city significantly relates to climate planning. Along with the need to further explore these relations, we see a need for more economic and institutional support for smaller and less resourceful cities and those at high risk from climate change impacts in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1907012193,"Drought stress triggers mature leaf senescence, which supports plant survival and remobilization of nutrients; yet leaf senescence also critically decreases post-drought crop yield. Drought generally results in carbon/nitrogen imbalance, which is reflected in the increased carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio in mature leaves, and which has been shown to be involved in inducing leaf senescence under normal growth conditions. Yet the involvement of the carbon/nitrogen balance in regulation of drought-induced leaf senescence is unclear. To investigate the role of carbon/nitrogen balance in drought-induced senescence, sorghum seedlings were subjected to a gradual soil drought treatment. Leaf senescence symptoms and the C:N ratio, which was indicated by the ratio of non-structural carbohydrate to total N content, were monitored during drought progression. In this study, leaf senescence developed about 12 days after the start of drought treatment, as indicated by various senescence symptoms including decreasing photosynthesis, photosystem II photochemistry efficiency (Fv/Fm) and chlorophyll content, and by the differential expression of senescence marker genes. The C:N ratio was significantly enhanced 10 to 12 days into drought treatment. Leaf senescence occurred in the older (lower) leaves, which had higher C:N ratios, but not in the younger (upper) leaves, which had lower C:N ratios. In addition, a detached leaf assay was conducted to investigate the effect of carbon/nitrogen availability on drought-induced senescence. Exogenous application of excess sugar combined with limited nitrogen promoted drought-induced leaf senescence. Thus our results suggest that the carbon/nitrogen balance may be involved in the regulation of drought-induced leaf senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2324281604,"Human cell lines are often used to investigate cellular pathways relevant for physiological or pathological processes or to evaluate cell toxicity or protection induced by different compounds, including potential drugs. In this study, we analyzed and compared the differentiating activities of three agents (retinoic acid, staurosporine and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) on the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-M17 cell lines; the first cell line is largely used in the field of neuroscience, while the second is still poorly characterized. After evaluating their effects in terms of cell proliferation and morphology, we investigated their catecholaminergic properties by assessing the expression profiles of the major genes involved in catecholamine synthesis and storage and the cellular concentrations of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline. Our results demonstrate that the two cell lines possess similar abilities to differentiate and acquire a neuron-like morphology. The most evident effects in SH-SY5Y cells were observed in the presence of staurosporine, while in BE(2)-M17 cells, retinoic acid induced the strongest effects. Undifferentiated SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-M17 cells are characterized by the production of both NA and DA, but their levels are considerably higher in BE(2)-M17 cells. Moreover, the NAergic phenotype appears to be more pronounced in SH-SY5Y cells, while BE(2)-M17 cells have a more prominent DAergic phenotype. Finally, the catecholamine concentration strongly increases upon differentiation induced by staurosporine in both cell lines. In conclusion, in this work the catecholaminergic phenotype of the human BE(2)-M17 cell line upon differentiation was characterized for the first time. Our data suggest that SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-M17 represent two alternative cell models for the neuroscience field."
https://openalex.org/W1903531537,"High-throughput sequencing technologies have offered in recent years new opportunities to study genome variations. These studies have mostly focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions or deletions and on copy number variants. Other structural variants, such as large insertions or deletions, tandem duplications, translocations, and inversions are less well-studied, despite that some have an important impact on phenotypes. In the present study, we performed a large-scale survey of structural variants in cattle. We report the identification of 6,426 putative structural variants in cattle extracted from whole-genome sequence data of 62 bulls representing the three major French dairy breeds. These genomic variants affect DNA segments greater than 50 base pairs and correspond to deletions, inversions and tandem duplications. Out of these, we identified a total of 547 deletions and 410 tandem duplications which could potentially code for CNVs. Experimental validation was carried out on 331 structural variants using a novel high-throughput genotyping method. Out of these, 255 structural variants (77%) generated good quality genotypes and 191 (75%) of them were validated. Gene content analyses in structural variant regions revealed 941 large deletions removing completely one or several genes, including 10 single-copy genes. In addition, some of the structural variants are located within quantitative trait loci for dairy traits. This study is a pan-genome assessment of genomic variations in cattle and may provide a new glimpse into the bovine genome architecture. Our results may also help to study the effects of structural variants on gene expression and consequently their effect on certain phenotypes of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2168966020,"Deregulated expression of activin A is reported in several tumors, but its biological functions in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are unknown. Here, we investigate whether activin A can play a causal role in OSCCs. Activin A expression was assessed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry in OSCC tissues. Low activin A-expressing cells were treated with recombinant activin A and assessed for apoptosis, proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Those phenotypes were also evaluated in high activin A-expressing cells treated with follistatin (an activin A antagonist) or stably expressing shRNA targeting activin A. Transfections of microRNA mimics were performed to determine whether the overexpression of activin A is regulated by miR-143/miR-145 cluster. Activin A was overexpressed in OSCCs in comparison with normal oral mucosa, and high activin A levels were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, tumor differentiation and poor survival. High activin A levels promoted multiple properties associated with malignant transformation, including decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT. Both miR-143 and miR-145 were markedly downregulated in OSCC cell lines and in clinical specimens, and inversely correlated to activin A levels. Forced expression of miR-143 and miR-145 in OSCC cells significantly decreased the expression of activin A. Overexpression of activin A in OSCCs, which is controlled by downregulation of miR-143/miR-145 cluster, regulates apoptosis, proliferation and invasiveness, and it is clinically correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival."

https://openalex.org/W1893327867,"Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal bacterium residing in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals, but in certain situations it is also an opportunistic pathogen which can cause serious disease. Macrophages have been shown to play a critical role in controlling infections by commensal enterococci and also have an important role in mediating chromosomal instability and promoting colon cancer during high-level enterococcal colonization in genetically susceptible mice. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction of macrophages with enterococci during infection are not fully understood. In this study, using BMDM and RAW264.7 macrophages we show that enterococcal infection activates ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK as well as NF-κB, and drives polarization of macrophages towards the M1 phenotype. Inhibition of NF-κB activation significantly reduced the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β, as did the inhibition of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, although to differing extent. Enterococci-induced activation of these pathways and subsequent cytokine expression was contact dependent, modest compared to activation by E. coli and, required the adaptor protein MyD88. Phagocytosis of enterococci by macrophages was enhanced by preopsonization with E. faecalis antiserum and involved the ERK and JNK signaling pathways, with the adaptor protein MyD88 as an important mediator. This study of the interaction of macrophages with enterococci could provide a foundation for studying the pathogenesis of infection by this opportunistic pathogen and to developing new therapeutic approaches to combat enterococcal infection."

Using a combination of high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we showed unbiased metabolomic profiles of disrupted arginine pathways with increased Nitric oxide (NO) and decreased arginine. Our results also showed specific metabolic pathways and genetic profiles with increased Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) metabolites as well as increased Heme metabolites with altered oxidative pathways in the advanced stage of the human PAH lung. The results suggest that PAH has specific metabolic pathways contributing to the vascular remodeling in severe pulmonary hypertension. Profiling metabolomic alterations of the PAH lung has provided a new understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of PAH, which benefits therapeutic targeting to specific metabolic pathways involved in the progression of PAH."
https://openalex.org/W2142221819,"We show that the key flowering regulators encoded by Phalaenopsis aphrodite FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (PaFT1) and PaFD share high sequence homologies to these from long-day flowering Arabidopsis and short-day flowering rice. Interestingly, PaFT1 is specifically up-regulated during flowering inductive cooling treatment but is not subjected to control by photoperiod in P. aphrodite. Phloem or shoot apex-specific expression of PaFT1 restores the late flowering of Arabidopsis ft mutants. Moreover, PaFT1 can suppress the delayed flowering caused by SHORT VEGATATIVE PHASE (SVP) overexpression as well as an active FRIGIDA (FRI) allele, indicating the functional conservation of flowering regulatory circuit in different plant species. PaFT1 promoter:GUS in Arabidopsis showed similar staining pattern to that of Arabidopsis FT in the leaves and guard cells but different in the shoot apex. A genomic clone or heat shock-inducible expression of PaFT1 is sufficient to the partial complementation of the ft mutants. Remarkably, ectopic PaFT1 expression also triggers precocious heading in rice. To further demonstrate the functional conservation of the flowering regulators, we show that PaFD, a bZIP transcription factor involved in flowering promotion, interacts with PaFT1, and PaFD partially complemented Arabidopsis fd mutants. Transgenic rice expressing PaFD also flowered early with increased expression of rice homologues of APETALA1 (AP1). Consistently, PaFT1 knock-down Phalaenopsis plants generated by virus-induced gene silencing exhibit delayed spiking. These studies suggest functional conservation of FT and FD genes, which may have evolved and integrated into distinct regulatory circuits in monopodial orchids, Arabidopsis and rice that promote flowering under their own inductive conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1916299561,"Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are widely expressed in brain and involved in various aspects of brain function. Both TRPC4 and TRPC5 have been implicated in innate fear function, which represents a key response to environmental stress. However, to what extent the TRPC4/C5 channels are involved in psychiatric disorders remains unexplored. Here, we tested the antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects of a newly identified TRPC4/C5 inhibitor, M084. We show that a single intraperitoneal administration of M084 at 10 mg/kg body weight to C57BL/6 male mice significantly shortened the immobility time in forced swim test and tail suspension test within as short as 2 hours. The M084-treated mice spent more time exploring in illuminated and open areas in light/dark transition test and elevated plus maze test. In mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress, M084 treatment reversed the enhanced immobility time in forced swim test and decreased the latency to feed in novelty suppressed feeding test. The treatment of M084 increased BDNF expression in both mRNA and protein levels, as well as phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK, in prefrontal cortex. Our results indicate that M084 exerts rapid antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects at least in part by acting on BDNF and its downstream signaling. We propose M084 as a lead compound for further druggability research."
https://openalex.org/W2165478998,"Dual-task performance is often impaired after stroke. This may be resolved by enhancing patients' automaticity of movement. This study sets out to test the constrained action hypothesis, which holds that automaticity of movement is enhanced by triggering an external focus (on movement effects), rather than an internal focus (on movement execution). Thirty-nine individuals with chronic, unilateral stroke performed a one-leg-stepping task with both legs in single- and dual-task conditions. Attentional focus was manipulated with instructions. Motor performance (movement speed), movement automaticity (fluency of movement), and dual-task performance (dual-task costs) were assessed. The effects of focus on movement speed, single- and dual-task movement fluency, and dual-task costs were analysed with generalized estimating equations. Results showed that, overall, single-task performance was unaffected by focus (p = .341). Regarding movement fluency, no main effects of focus were found in single- or dual-task conditions (p's ≥ .13). However, focus by leg interactions suggested that an external focus reduced movement fluency of the paretic leg compared to an internal focus (single-task conditions: p = .068; dual-task conditions: p = .084). An external focus also tended to result in inferior dual-task performance (β = -2.38, p = .065). Finally, a near-significant interaction (β = 2.36, p = .055) suggested that dual-task performance was more constrained by patients' attentional capacity in external focus conditions. We conclude that, compared to an internal focus, an external focus did not result in more automated movements in chronic stroke patients. Contrary to expectations, trends were found for enhanced automaticity with an internal focus. These findings might be due to patients' strong preference to use an internal focus in daily life. Future work needs to establish the more permanent effects of learning with different attentional foci on re-automating motor control after stroke."
https://openalex.org/W1903719059,"Allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC) is an organosulfur phytochemical found in abundance in common cruciferous vegetables such as mustard, wasabi, and cabbage. Although AITC is metabolized primarily through the mercapturic acid pathway, its exact pharmacokinetics remains undefined and the biological function of AITC metabolites is still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of AITC metabolites on lipid accumulation in vitro and elucidated the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of AITC metabolites in rats. We found that AITC metabolites generally conjugate with glutathione (GSH) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and are distributed in most organs and tissues. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a rapid uptake and complete metabolism of AITC following oral administration to rats. Although AITC has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor activity in bladder cancer, the potential bioactivity of its metabolites has not been explored. We found that GSH-AITC and NAC-AITC effectively inhibit adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and suppress expression of PPAR-γ, C/EBPα, and FAS, which are up-regulated during adipogenesis. GSH-AITC and NAC-AITC also suppressed oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation and lipogenesis in hepatocytes. Our findings suggest that AITC is almost completely metabolized in the liver and rapidly excreted in urine through the mercapturic acid pathway following administration in rats. AITC metabolites may exert anti-obesity effects through suppression of adipogenesis or lipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1909210767,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. The pore-forming toxin pneumolysin is a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae, which can be sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Among the over 90 serotypes, serotype 1 pneumococci (particularly MLST306) have emerged across the globe as a major cause of invasive disease. The cause for its particularity is, however, incompletely understood. We therefore examined pneumococcal infection in human cells and a human lung organ culture system mimicking infection of the lower respiratory tract. We demonstrate that different pneumococcal serotypes differentially activate inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production in human lung tissue and cells. Whereas serotype 2, 3, 6B, 9N pneumococci expressing fully haemolytic pneumolysins activate NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent responses, serotype 1 and 8 strains expressing non-haemolytic toxins are poor activators of IL-1β production. Accordingly, purified haemolytic pneumolysin but not serotype 1-associated non-haemolytic toxin activates strong IL-1β production in human lungs. Our data suggest that the evasion of inflammasome-dependent innate immune responses by serotype 1 pneumococci might contribute to their ability to cause invasive diseases in humans."

Four major ethnics, Uygur, Han, Kazak, and Hui children in this region were investigated during February 2010 and May 2012.A total of 14,530 children (0-18 yr) were examined. Of these children, 240 (boys, 43.8%, and girls, 56.3%) were identified with CHD, giving an overall prevalence of 16.5‰ (17.7‰ in Uygur, 6.9‰ in Han, 11.4‰ in Kazak, and 38.1‰ in Hui Chinese, respectively). Ventricular septal defect (VSD, 29.2%), atrial septal defect (ASD, 20.8%), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, 13.7%), acleistocardia (13.7%), Bicuspid aortic valve (7.9%), pulmonary valve stenosis (5.4%), and tetralogy of fallot (TOF, 4.2%) were common cyanotic and cyanotic defects observed. Compared to non-CHD children, children with CHD had a higher percentage of history of abortion, CHD history of family, consanguinity and premature birth (all P<0.05). In CHD children, 24% of mothers caught a cold, 10% had a febrile illness and 6.7% received antibiotic treatment during the first trimester of pregnancy, that were higher than non-CHD group (all P<0.05).The overall prevalence of CHD in four ethnic children at ages 0-18 yr in Xinjiang was 16.5‰. VSD, ASD and TOF were the most common acyanotic and cyanotic congenital heart defects, respectively. This study also identified some modifiable risk factors that may contribute to the incidence of CHD among the 4 ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W1951647769,"Background Allergy to short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) pollen is a serious and expanding health problem in North America and Europe. Whereas only 10 short ragweed pollen allergens are officially recorded, patterns of IgE reactivity observed in ragweed allergic patients suggest that other allergens contribute to allergenicity. The objective of the present study was to identify novel allergens following extensive characterization of the transcriptome and proteome of short ragweed pollen. Methods Following a Proteomics-Informed-by-Transcriptomics approach, a comprehensive transcriptomic data set was built up from RNA-seq analysis of short ragweed pollen. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses and IgE reactivity profiling after high resolution 2D-gel electrophoresis were then combined to identify novel allergens. Results Short ragweed pollen transcripts were assembled after deep RNA sequencing and used to inform proteomic analyses, thus leading to the identification of 573 proteins in the short ragweed pollen. Patterns of IgE reactivity of individual sera from 22 allergic patients were assessed using an aqueous short ragweed pollen extract resolved over 2D-gels. Combined with information derived from the annotated pollen proteome, those analyses revealed the presence of multiple unreported IgE reactive proteins, including new Amb a 1 and Amb a 3 isoallergens as well as 7 novel candidate allergens reacting with IgEs from 20–70% of patients. The latter encompass members of the carbonic anhydrase, enolase, galactose oxidase, GDP dissociation inhibitor, pathogenesis related-17, polygalacturonase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase families. Conclusions We extended the list of allergens identified in short ragweed pollen. These findings have implications for both diagnosis and allergen immunotherapy purposes."
https://openalex.org/W1959791612,"Intracellular protein aggregation is the hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Aggregates formed by polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded proteins, such as Huntingtin, adopt amyloid-like structures that are resistant to denaturation. We used a novel purification strategy to isolate aggregates formed by human Huntingtin N-terminal fragments with expanded polyQ tracts from both yeast and mammalian (PC-12) cells. Using mass spectrometry we identified the protein species that are trapped within these polyQ aggregates. We found that proteins with very long intrinsically-disordered (ID) domains (≥ 100 amino acids) and RNA-binding proteins were disproportionately recruited into aggregates. The removal of the ID domains from selected proteins was sufficient to eliminate their recruitment into polyQ aggregates. We also observed that several neurodegenerative disease-linked proteins were reproducibly trapped within the polyQ aggregates purified from mammalian cells. Many of these proteins have large ID domains and are found in neuronal inclusions in their respective diseases. Our study indicates that neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins are particularly vulnerable to recruitment into polyQ aggregates via their ID domains. Also, the high frequency of ID domains in RNA-binding proteins may explain why RNA-binding proteins are frequently found in pathological inclusions in various neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1953427497,"Lifestyle modification is the first step in hypertension management. Our objective was to assess adherence to lifestyle recommendations by individuals who were aware of their hypertension and to identify characteristics associated with non-adherence. Using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2010–2012, we compared the adherence to six lifestyle recommendations of hypertensive subjects aware of the status of their condition with that of those who were not aware, based on survey regression analysis. The characteristics associated with non-adherence were assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Of all hypertensive subjects, <20% adhered to a healthy diet and reduced salt intake and about 80% moderated alcohol consumption and did not smoke. Half of all subjects maintained normal body weight and engaged in physical activity. Most lifestyle features of aware hypertensive Koreans did not differ greatly from those of hypertensive individuals who were not aware. Reduction in salt intake was slightly more prevalent among those aware of their hypertensive status. Obesity was more prevalent among the aware hypertensive subjects, and the prevalence of obesity increased with the duration of hypertension. Male gender, younger age, residence in a rural area, low income, and the use of antihypertensive medication were associated with non-adherence to lifestyle recommendations by hypertensive individuals. Many hypertensive Koreans do not comply with lifestyle recommendations for the management of hypertension. The association between the use of antihypertensive medications and non-adherence suggested an over-reliance on medication rather than a commitment to a healthy lifestyle. Our study highlights that efforts encouraging healthy lifestyles, as the first step in hypertension management, need to be increased."
https://openalex.org/W1903766411,"The demands of a growing human population dictates that expansion of energy infrastructure, roads, and other development frequently takes place in native rangelands. Particularly, transmission lines and roads commonly divide rural landscapes and increase fragmentation. This has direct and indirect consequences on native wildlife that can be mitigated through thoughtful planning and proactive approaches to identifying areas of high conservation priority. We used nine years (2003–2011) of Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) lek locations totaling 870 unique leks sites in Kansas and seven geographic information system (GIS) layers describing land cover, topography, and anthropogenic structures to model habitat suitability across the state. The models obtained had low omission rates (<0.18) and high area under the curve scores (AUC >0.81), indicating high model performance and reliability of predicted habitat suitability for Greater Prairie-Chickens. We found that elevation was the most influential in predicting lek locations, contributing three times more predictive power than any other variable. However, models were improved by the addition of land cover and anthropogenic features (transmission lines, roads, and oil and gas structures). Overall, our analysis provides a hierarchal understanding of Greater Prairie-Chicken habitat suitability that is broadly based on geomorphological features followed by land cover suitability. We found that when land features and vegetation cover are suitable for Greater Prairie-Chickens, fragmentation by anthropogenic sources such as roadways and transmission lines are a concern. Therefore, it is our recommendation that future human development in Kansas avoid areas that our models identified as highly suitable for Greater Prairie-Chickens and focus development on land cover types that are of lower conservation concern."

The Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Child Version (OCI-CV) is a well-established assessment self-report, with special interest for the assessment of dimensions of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This instrument has shown to be useful for clinical and non-clinical populations in two languages (English and European Spanish). Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the OCI-CV in a Chilean community sample. The sample consisted of 816 children and adolescents with a mean age of 14.54 years (SD = 2.21; range = 10-18 years). Factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent/divergent validity, and gender/age differences were examined. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a 6-factor structure (Doubting/Checking, Obsessing, Hoarding, Washing, Ordering, and Neutralizing) with one second-order factor. Good estimates of reliability (including internal consistency and test-retest), evidence supporting the validity, and small age and gender differences (higher levels of OCD symptomatology among older participants and women, respectively) are found. The OCI-CV is also an adequate scale for the assessment of obsessions and compulsions in a general population of Chilean children and adolescents."

The accessions of 95 diospyros germplasms belonging to four species Diospyros kaki Thunb, D. oleifera Cheng, D. kaki var. silverstris Mak, and D. lotus Linn were collected from different eco-climatic zones in Guangxi and were analyzed using SCoT markers.Results indicated that the accessions of 95 diospyros germplasms could be distinguished using SCoT markers, and were divided into three groups at similarity coefficient of 0.608; these germplasms that belong to the same species were clustered together; of these, the degree of genetic diversity of the natural D. kaki var. silverstris Mak population was richest among the four species; the geographical distance showed that the 12 natural populations of D. kaki var. silverstris Mak were divided into two groups at similarity coefficient of 0.19. Meanwhile, in order to further verify the stable and useful of SCoT markers in diospyros germplasms, SSR markers were also used in current research to analyze the genetic diversity and relationship in the same diospyros germplasms. Once again, majority of germplasms that belong to the same species were clustered together. Thus SCoT markers were stable and especially useful for analysis of the genetic diversity and relationship in diospyros germplasms.The molecular characterization and diversity assessment of diospyros were very important for conservation of diospyros germplasm resources, meanwhile for diospyros improvement."

Genetic studies have associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding nitric oxide synthase and matrix metalloproteases with preeclampsia, but the results are largely inconclusive across different populations.To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOS3 (G894T, T-786C, and a variable number of tandem repetitions VNTR in intron 4), MMP2 (C-1306T), and MMP9 (C-1562T) genes with preeclampsia in patients from Southeastern Brazil.This prospective case-control study enrolled 77 women with preeclampsia and 266 control pregnant women. Clinical data were collected to assess risk factors and the presence of severe complications, such as eclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome.We found a significant association between the single nucleotide polymorphism NOS3 T-786C and preeclampsia, independently from age, height, weight, or the other SNPs studied, and no association was found with the other polymorphisms. Age and history of preeclampsia were also identified as risk factors. The presence of at least one polymorphic allele for NOS3 T-786C was also associated with the occurrence of eclampsia or HELLP syndrome among preeclamptic women.Our data support that the NOS3 T-786C SNP is associated with preeclampsia and the severity of its complications."

The PDB's large corpus of data (> 100,000 structures) and related citations provide a well-organized and extensive test set for developing and understanding data citation and access metrics. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of how authors cite PDB as a data repository. We describe a novel metric based on information cascade constructed by exploring the citation network to measure influence between competing works and apply that to analyze different data citation practices to PDB. Based on this new metric, we found that the original publication of RCSB PDB in the year 2000 continues to attract most citations though many follow-up updates were published. None of these follow-up publications by members of the wwPDB organization can compete with the original publication in terms of citations and influence. Meanwhile, authors increasingly choose to use URLs of PDB in the text instead of citing PDB papers, leading to disruption of the growth of the literature citations. A comparison of data usage statistics and paper citations shows that PDB Web access is highly correlated with URL mentions in the text. The results reveal the trend of how authors cite a biomedical data repository and may provide useful insight of how to measure the impact of a data repository."
https://openalex.org/W2139783136,"This study aimed to evaluate protection induced by the vaccine candidate B. ovis ΔabcBA against experimental challenge with wild type B. ovis in rams.

Serum, urine, and semen samples were collected during two months after immunization. The rams were then challenged with wild type B. ovis (ATCC25840), and the results were compared to non immunized and experimentally challenged rams. Immunization, particularly with encapsulated B. ovis ΔabcBA, prevented infection, secretion of wild type B. ovis in the semen and urine, shedding of neutrophils in the semen, and the development of clinical changes, gross and microscopic lesions induced by the wild type B. ovis reference strain. Collectively, our data indicates that the B. ovis ΔabcBA strain is an exceptionally good vaccine strain for preventing brucellosis caused by B. ovis infection in rams."
https://openalex.org/W2095799421,"Background Results from epidemiological studies indicate a close association between periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism linking periodontitis to glucose intolerance (GI) and insulin resistance (IR) is unknown. We therefore tested the hypothesis that periodontitis induces the development of GI/IR through a liver Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent mechanism. Methods TLR4 chimeric mice were developed by bone marrow transplantation using green fluorescent protein expressing TLR4WT mouse (GFPWT) as donor and TLR4 WT or TLR4-/- as recipient mice (GFPWT:WT and GFPWT:KO chimeras respectively). These chimeras were subjected to experimental chronic periodontitis induced by repeated applications of LPS to the gingival sulci for 18 weeks. The levels of GI/IR were monitored and plasma cytokines and LPS were determined at 18 weeks when differences in glucose tolerance were most apparent. Cytokine gene expression was measured in liver tissue by qPCR. Results Alveolar bone loss was significantly greater in GFPWT:WT chimeras treated with LPS compared with chimeras treated with PBS or GFPWT:KO chimeras. However, the degree of gingival inflammation was similar between GFPWT:WT and GFPWT:KO mice with LPS application. Severe GI/IR occurred in GFPWT:WT chimeras but not in the GFPWT:KO chimeras that were subjected to 18 weeks of LPS. Serum LPS was detected only in animals to which LPS was applied and the level was similar in GFPWT:WT and GFPWT:KO mice at the 18 week time point. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the plasma levels of IL1β, IL6 and TNFα at 18 weeks in spite of the severe GI/IR in the GFPWT:WT chimeras with LPS application. Also, no difference in the expression of TNFα or IL6 mRNA was detected in the liver of GFPWT:WT vs GFPWT:KO mice. In contrast, liver IL1β expression was significantly greater in GFPWT:WT chimeras compared to GFPWT:KO chimeras treated with LPS. Conclusion We observed that GFPWT:WT, but not GFPWT:KO chimeras, treated with LPS developed GI/IR despite similar degrees of gingival inflammation, circulating cytokine levels, and LPS concentrations. We conclude that LPS from periodontitis sites has a pivotal role in triggering the development of GI/IR through a mechanism that involves TLR4 expression by resident macrophages/Kupffer cells in the liver."

We determined that a total of 75 L-asparaginase related hyperglycemia events occurred in 69 patients. Although 17 events (17/1176, 1.4%) developed in induction phase, which was lower incidence than those (10-15%) in previous reports, 45 events developed during the maintenance phase with protracted L-asparaginase administration. Multivariate analysis showed that older age at onset (≥ 10 years) was a sole independent risk factor for L-asparaginase-related hyperglycemia (P<0.01), especially in maintenance phase. Contrary to the previous reports, obesity was not associated with L-asparaginase-related hyperglycemia.

https://openalex.org/W1783287906,"Wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) has not been seen anywhere since the last case of WPV3-associated paralysis in Nigeria in November 2012. At the time of writing, the most recent case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria occurred in July 2014, and WPV1 has not been seen in Africa since a case in Somalia in August 2014. No cases associated with circulating vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) have been detected in Nigeria since November 2014. Has WPV1 been eliminated from Africa? Has WPV3 been eradicated globally? Has Nigeria interrupted cVDPV2 transmission? These questions are difficult because polio surveillance is based on paralysis and paralysis only occurs in a small fraction of infections. This report provides estimates for the probabilities of poliovirus elimination in Nigeria given available data as of March 31, 2015. It is based on a model of disease transmission that is built from historical polio incidence rates and is designed to represent the uncertainties in transmission dynamics and poliovirus detection that are fundamental to interpreting long time periods without cases. The model estimates that, as of March 31, 2015, the probability of WPV1 elimination in Nigeria is 84%, and that if WPV1 has not been eliminated, a new case will be detected with 99% probability by the end of 2015. The probability of WPV3 elimination (and thus global eradication) is > 99%. However, it is unlikely that the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 has been interrupted; the probability of cVDPV2 elimination rises to 83% if no new cases are detected by April 2016."

Material and Methods All subjects underwent an abdominal examination on a 3.0T MRI scanner. Two radiologists independently scored the image quality (IQ). An optimal set of DTI parameters was obtained from a group of fifteen volunteers with multiple b-values (100, 300, 500, and 800 s/mm2) and various diffusion-encoding directions (NED = 6, 9, and 12)using two way ANOVA analysis. Eighteen Patients with HCC underwent DTI scans with the optimized parameters. Fractional anisotropy(FA) and average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured. The differences of FA and ADC values between liver healthy region and HCC lesion were compared through paired t tests. Results There were no significant changes in liver IQ and FA/ADC values with increased NED(P >0.05), whereas the liver IQ and FA/ADC values decreased significantly with increased b-values(P <0.05). Good IQ, acceptable scan time and reasonable FA/ADC values were acquired using NED = 9 with b-value of (0,300) s/mm2. Using the optimized DTI sequence, ADC value of the tumor lesion was significantly lower than that of the healthy liver region (1.30 ± 0.34×10−3 vs 1.52 ± 0.27×10−3 mm2/s, P = 0.013), whereas the mean FA value of the tumor lesion (0.42 ± 0.11) was significantly higher than the normal liver region (0.32 ± 0.10) (P = 0.004). Conclusion Either FA or ADC value from DTI can be used to differentiate HCC from healthy liver. HCC lead to higher FA value and lower ADC value on DTI than healthy liver."

Paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is important in control of sympathetic outflow. This study was designed to investigate the role of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in PVN in regulating the AAR.Experiments were carried out in anesthetized rats. Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were continuously recorded. AAR was evaluated by the RSNA and MAP responses to electrical stimulation of the right epididymal WAT (eWAT) afferent nerve. Electrical stimulation of eWAT afferent nerve increase RSNA. Bilateral microinjection of the GABAA receptor agonist isoguvacine or the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen attenuated the AAR. The effect of isoguvacine on the AAR was greater than that of baclofen. The GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine enhanced the AAR, while the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP-35348 had no significant effect on the AAR. Bilateral PVN microinjection of vigabatrin, a selective GABA-transaminase inhibitor, to increase endogenous GABA levels in the PVN abolished the AAR. The inhibitory effect of vigabatrin on the AAR was attenuated by the pretreatment with gabazine or CGP-35348. Pretreatment with combined gabazine and CGP-35348 abolished the effects of vigabatrin.Activation of GABAA or GABAB receptors in the PVN inhibits the AAR.

We combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and biochemical approaches to determine the mechanism of 14-3-3 protein regulation of CaSR signaling. Loss of 14-3-3 binding caused increased basal CaSR signaling and plasma membrane levels, and a significantly larger signaling-evoked increase in plasma membrane receptors. Block of core glycosylation with tunicamycin demonstrated that changes in plasma membrane CaSR levels were due to differences in exocytic rate. Western blotting to quantify time-dependent changes in maturation of expressed wt CaSR and a 14-3-3 protein binding-defective mutant demonstrated that signaling increases synthesis to maintain constant levels of the immaturely and maturely glycosylated forms. CaSR thus operates by a feed-forward mechanism, whereby signaling not only induces anterograde trafficking of nascent receptors but also increases biosynthesis to maintain steady state levels of net cellular CaSR. Overall, these studies suggest that 14-3-3 binding at the carboxyl terminus provides an important buffering mechanism to increase the intracellular pool of CaSR available for signaling-evoked trafficking, but attenuates trafficking to control the dynamic range of responses to extracellular calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1959227874,"Many global challenges, including obesity, health care costs, and climate change, could be addressed in part by increasing the use of bicycles for transportation. Concern about the safety of bicycling on roadways is frequently cited as a deterrent to increasing bicycle use in the USA. The use of effective signage along roadways might help alleviate these concerns by increasing knowledge about the rights and duties of bicyclists and motorists, ideally reducing crashes. We administered a web-based survey, using Twitter for recruitment, to examine how well three US traffic control devices communicated the message that bicyclists are permitted in the center of the travel lane and do not have to ""get out of the way"" to allow motorists to pass without changing lanes: ""Bicycles May Use Full Lane"" and ""Share the Road"" signage, and Shared Lane Markings on the pavement. Each was compared to an unsigned roadway. We also asked respondents whether it was safe for a bicyclist to occupy the center of the travel lane. ""Bicycles May Use Full Lane"" signage was the most consistently comprehended device for communicating the message that bicyclists may occupy the travel lane and also increased perceptions of safety. ""Share the Road"" signage did not increase comprehension or perceptions of safety. Shared Lane Markings fell somewhere between. ""Bicycles May Use Full Lane"" signage showed notable increases in comprehension among novice bicyclists and private motor vehicle commuters, critical target audiences for efforts to promote bicycling in the USA. Although limited in scope, our survey results are indicative and suggest that Departments of Transportation consider replacing ""Share the Road"" with ""Bicycles May Use Full Lane"" signage, possibly combined with Shared Lane Markings, if the intent is to increase awareness of roadway rights and responsibilities. Further evaluation through virtual reality simulations and on-road experiments is merited."
https://openalex.org/W1920581195,"Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the offshore fisheries industry in the Republic of Korea (Korea) were examined in response to growing concerns about global warming and the contribution of emissions from different industrial sectors. Fuel usage and GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) were analysed using the 'Tier 1' method provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from the offshore fishery, which is the primary domestic seafood production sector in Korea. In 2013, fuel usage in the offshore fishery accounted for 59.7% (557,463 KL) of total fuel consumption of fishing vessels in Korea. Fuel consumption and thus GHG emissions were not stable through time in this industry, increasing by 2.4% p.a. for three consecutive years, from 2011 to 2013, despite a decrease in the number of vessels operating. GHG emissions generated in offshore fisheries also changed through time and increased from 1,442,975 tCO2e/year in 2011 to 1,477,279 tCO2e/year in 2013. Changes in both fuel use and GHG emissions per kg offshore fish production appeared to be associated with decreasing catch rates by the fleet, which in turn were a reflection of decrease in fish biomass. Another important feature of GHG emissions in this industry was the high variation in GHG emission per kg fish product among different fishing methods. The long line fishery had approximately three times the emissions of the average production while the jigging fishery was more than two times higher than the average. Lowest emissions were from the trawl sector, which is regarded as having greatest environmental impact using traditional biodiversity metrics although had lowest environmental impact in terms of fuel and GHG emission metrics used in this study. The observed deterioration in fuel efficiency of the offshore fishery each year is of concern but also demonstrates that fuel efficiency can change, which shows there is opportunity to improve efficiency with changes to fishery management and harvesting operations."
https://openalex.org/W1927973672,"Activation of apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2) and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) inhibits foam cell formation. Reelin is a ligand of these receptors. Here we generated two reelin subregions containing the receptor binding domain with or without its C-terminal region (R5-6C and R5-6, respectively) and studied the impact of these peptides on macrophage cholesterol metabolism. We found that both R5-6C and R5-6 can be secreted by cells. Purified R5-6 protein can bind apoER2 and VLDLR. Overexpression of apoER2 in macrophages increased the amount of R5-6 bound to the cell surface. Treatment of macrophages with 0.2 μg/ml R5-6 elevated ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) protein level by ~72% and apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux by ~39%. In addition, the medium harvested from cells overexpressing R5-6 or R5-6C (R5-6- and R5-6C-conditioned media, respectively) also up-regulated ABCA1 protein expression, which was associated with accelerated cholesterol efflux and enhanced phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and specificity protein-1 (Sp1) in macrophages. The increased ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux by R5-6- and R5-6C-conditioned media were diminished by Sp1 or PI3K inhibitors mithramycin A and LY294002. Further, the cholesterol accumulation induced by apoB-containing, apoE-free lipoproteins was significantly less in macrophages incubated with R5-6- or R5-6C-conditioned medium than in those incubated with control conditioned medium. Knockdown of apoER2 or VLDLR attenuated the inhibitory role of R5-6-conditioned medium against lipoprotein-induced cholesterol accumulation. These results suggest that the reelin subregion R5-6 can serve as a tool for studying the role of apoER2 and VLDLR in atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1931496364,"It is contentious whether size variation among mammalian teeth is heterogeneous or homogeneous, whether the coefficient of variation is reliable, and whether the standard deviation of log-transformed data and the residual of standard deviation on mean variable size are useful replacements for the coefficient of variation. Most studies of tooth size variation have been on mammals with complex-crowned teeth, with relatively little attention paid to taxa with simple-crowned teeth, such as Pinnipedia. To fill this gap in knowledge and to resolve the existing controversies, we explored the variation of linear size variables (length and width) for all teeth from complete permanent dentitions of four pinniped species, two phocids (Histriophoca fasciata, Phoca largha) and two otariids (Callorhinus ursinus, Eumetopias jubatus). Size variation among these teeth was mostly heterogeneous both along the toothrow and among species. The incisors, canines, and mesial and distal postcanines were often relatively highly variable. The levels of overall dental size variation ranged from relatively low as in land carnivorans (Phoca largha and both otariids) to high (Histriophoca fasciata). Sexual size dimorphism varied among teeth and among species, with teeth being, on average, larger in males than in females. This dimorphism was more pronounced, and the canines were larger and more dimorphic relative to other teeth in the otariids than in the phocids. The coefficient of variation quantified variation reliably in most cases. The standard deviation of log-transformed data was redundant with the coefficient of variation. The residual of standard deviation on mean variable size was inaccurate when size variation was considerably heterogeneous among the compared variables, and was incomparable between species and between sexes. The existing hypotheses invoking developmental fields, occlusal complexity, and the relative timing of tooth formation and sexually dimorphic hormonal activity do not adequately explain the differential size variation along the pinniped toothrow."
https://openalex.org/W1934839063,"A recommended field method to assess body composition in adolescent sprint athletes is currently lacking. Existing methods developed for non-athletic adolescents were not longitudinally validated and do not take maturation status into account. This longitudinal study compared two field methods, i.e., a Bio Impedance Analysis (BIA) and a skinfold based equation, with underwater densitometry to track body fat percentage relative to years from age at peak height velocity in adolescent sprint athletes. In this study, adolescent sprint athletes (34 girls, 35 boys) were measured every 6 months during 3 years (age at start = 14.8 ± 1.5yrs in girls and 14.7 ± 1.9yrs in boys). Body fat percentage was estimated in 3 different ways: 1) using BIA with the TANITA TBF 410; 2) using a skinfold based equation; 3) using underwater densitometry which was considered as the reference method. Height for age since birth was used to estimate age at peak height velocity. Cross-sectional analyses were performed using repeated measures ANOVA and Pearson correlations between measurement methods at each occasion. Data were analyzed longitudinally using a multilevel cross-classified model with the PROC Mixed procedure. In boys, compared to underwater densitometry, the skinfold based formula revealed comparable values for body fatness during the study period whereas BIA showed a different pattern leading to an overestimation of body fatness starting from 4 years after age at peak height velocity. In girls, both the skinfold based formula and BIA overestimated body fatness across the whole range of years from peak height velocity. The skinfold based method appears to give an acceptable estimation of body composition during growth as compared to underwater densitometry in male adolescent sprinters. In girls, caution is warranted when interpreting estimations of body fatness by both BIA and a skinfold based formula since both methods tend to give an overestimation."
https://openalex.org/W1961830009,"Neuromedin U (NMU) activates two G protein-coupled receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR2; this signaling not only controls many physiological responses but also promotes tumorigenesis in diverse tissues. We recently identified a novel truncated NMUR2 derived by alternative splicing, namely NMUR2S, from human ovarian cancer cDNA. Sequence analysis, cell surface ELISA and immunocytochemical staining using 293T cells indicated that NMUR2S can be expressed well on the cell surface as a six-transmembrane protein. Receptor pull-down and fluorescent resonance energy transfer assays demonstrated that NMUR1, NMUR2 and this newly discovered NMUR2S can not only form homomeric complexes but also heteromeric complexes with each other. Although not activated by NMU itself, functional assay in combination with receptor quantification and radio-ligand binding in 293T cells indicated that NMUR2S does not alter the translocation and stability of NMUR1 or NMUR2, but rather effectively dampens their signaling by blocking their NMU binding capability through receptor heterodimerization. We further demonstrated that NMU signaling is significantly up-regulated in human ovarian cancers, whereas expression of NMUR2S can block endogenous NMU signaling and further lead to suppression of proliferation in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. In contrast, in monocytic THP-1 cells that express comparable levels of NMUR1 and NMUR2S, depletion of NMUR2S restored both the signaling and effect of NMU. Thus, these results not only reveal the presence of previously uncharacterized heteromeric relationships among NMU receptors but also provide NMUR2S as a potential therapeutic target for the future treatment of NMU signaling-mediated cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1895234791,"VICKZ (IGF2BP1,2,3/ZBP1/Vg1RBP/IMP1,2,3) proteins bind RNA and help regulate many RNA-mediated processes. In the midbrain region of early chick embryos, VICKZ is expressed in the neural folds and along the basal surface of the neural epithelium, but, upon neural tube closure, is down-regulated in prospective cranial neural crest (CNC) cells, concomitant with their emigration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Electroporation of constructs that modulate cVICKZ expression demonstrates that this down-regulation is both necessary and sufficient for CNC EMT. These results suggest that VICKZ down-regulation in CNC cell-autonomously promotes EMT and migration. Reduction of VICKZ throughout the embryo, however, inhibits CNC migration non-cell-autonomously, as judged by transplantation experiments in Xenopus embryos.Given the positive role reported for VICKZ proteins in promoting cell migration of chick embryo fibroblasts and many types of cancer cells, we have begun to look for specific mRNAs that could mediate context-specific differences. We report here that the laminin receptor, integrin alpha 6, is down-regulated in the dorsal neural tube when CNC cells emigrate, this process is mediated by cVICKZ, and integrin alpha 6 mRNA is found in VICKZ ribonucleoprotein complexes. Significantly, prolonged inhibition of cVICKZ in either the neural tube or the nascent dermomyotome sheet, which also dynamically expresses cVICKZ, induces disruption of these epithelia. These data point to a previously unreported role for VICKZ in maintaining epithelial integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1915271894,"Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms are an increasing threat to hospitalized patients. Although rapid typing of MDR microorganisms is required to apply targeted prevention measures, technical barriers often prevent this. We aimed to assess whether extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella species are transmitted between patients and whether routine, rapid typing is needed.For 43 months, the clonality of all ESBL-producing Klebsiella isolates from patients admitted to Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands was assessed with Raman spectroscopy. A cluster was defined as n ≥ 2 patients who had identical isolates. Primary patients were the first patients in each cluster. Secondary patients were those identified with an isolate clonally related to the isolate of the primary patient.Isolates from 132 patients were analyzed. We identified 17 clusters, with 17 primary and 56 secondary patients. Fifty-nine patients had a unique isolate. Patients (n = 15) in four out of the 17 clusters were epidemiologically related. Ten of these 15 patients developed an infection.Clonal outbreaks of ESBL-producing Klebsiella species were detected in our hospital. Theoretically, after Raman spectroscopy had detected a cluster of n ≥ 2, six infections in secondary patients could have been prevented. These findings demonstrate that spread of ESBL-producing Klebsiella species occurs, even in a non-outbreak setting, and underscore the need for routine rapid typing of these MDR bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2283707012,"The lymphatic endothelium plays an important role in the maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis. It also participates in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which lymphatic endothelial cell responds to inflammatory stimuli. In this study, we explored the mechanisms by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in murine lymphatic endothelial cells (SV-LECs). LPS caused increases in cox-2 mRNA and protein levels, as well as in COX-2 promoter luciferase activity in SV-LECs. These actions were associated with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), JNK1/2 and p38MAPK activation, and NF-κB subunit p65 and C/EBPβ phosphorylation. PP2A-ASK1 signaling blockade reduced LPS-induced JNK1/2, p38MAPK, p65 and C/EBPβ phosphorylation. Transfection with PP2A siRNA reduced LPS's effects on p65 and C/EBPβ binding to the COX-2 promoter region. Transfected with the NF-κB or C/EBPβ site deletion of COX-2 reporter construct also abrogated LPS's enhancing effect on COX-2 promoter luciferase activity in SV-LECs. Taken together, the induction of COX-2 in SV-LECs exposed to LPS may involve PP2A-ASK1-JNK and/or p38MAPK-NF-κB and/or C/EBPβ cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1914716474,"Background Direct comparisons of the effect of a glycated haemoglobin measurement or an oral glucose tolerance test on the uptake and yield of screening in people of South Asian origin have not been made. We evaluated this in 18 to 60-year-old South Asian Surinamese. Materials and Methods We invited 3173 South Asian Surinamese for an oral glucose tolerance test between June 18th 2009- December 31st 2009 and 2012 for a glycated hemoglobin measurement between April 19th 2010-November 11th, 2010. Participants were selected from 48 general practices in The Hague, The Netherlands. We used mixed models regression to analyse differences in response and participation between the groups. We described differences in characteristics of participants and calculated the yield as the percentage of all cases identified, if all invitees had been offered screening with the specified method. Results The response and participation in the glycated hemoglobin group was higher than in the group offered an oral glucose tolerance test (participation 23.9 vs. 19.3; OR: 1.30, 95%-confidence interval1.01–1.69). After adjustment for age and sex, characteristics of participants were similar for both groups. Overall, glycated hemoglobin identified a similar percentage of type 2 diabetes cases but a higher percentage of prediabetes cases, in the population than the oral glucose tolerance test. Conclusion We found that glycated hemoglobin and the oral glucose tolerance test may be equally efficient for identification of type 2 diabetes in populations of South Asian origin. However, for programs aimed at identifying people at high risk of type 2 diabetes (i.e. with prediabetes), the oral glucose tolerance test may be a less efficient choice than glycated hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2116053435,"This study presents the first results on Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) individual spawning duration and its short-term temporal behavior. The study was based on direct measurements resulting from mtDNA analysis of the offspring of spawners held in transport cages during the 2013 spawning monitoring survey in Balearic waters. The number of females consisted of approximately 259 individuals with an average weight of 186 kg. The survey began on May 22 and ended on July 3. Spawning started on May 30 and was observed every night afterwards. The sampling of eggs for genetic monitoring was conducted for 9 days interspersed from the beginning of spawning to the end of the survey. A total of 946 eggs were analyzed and revealed 129 different haplotypes; 77 of these were not previously detected in the Mediterranean. A total of 69 haplotypes were observed in more than one spawning event and those with higher frequency lasted their maximum possible duration. The haplotypes present at the beginning of spawning were also identified at the end of the sampling, indicating a minimum spawning duration of 34 days, and individual annual fecundity was estimated at around 1290 eggs gr(-1). These results differed from those generally presumed until now and are indicative of a much higher fecundity. Females exhibited a regular spawning schedule but with the capacity to shift the spawning hour during the spawning season. These results were observed for the eastern population of Atlantic bluefin tuna and before extrapolating to the western population, their validity should be proved."
https://openalex.org/W1907206499,"Early-stage hepatic granuloma and advanced-stage fibrosis are important characteristics of schistosomiasis. The direct consequences of gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) in egg-induced granuloma formation have not been reported, although GdCl3 is known to block the macrophages. In present study, mice were infected with 15 Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) cercariae and treated with GdCl3 (10 mg/kg body weight) twice weekly from day 21 to day 42 post-infection during the onset of egg-laying towards early granuloma formation. Histochemical staining showed that repeated injection of GdCl3 decreased macrophages infiltration in liver of mice infected with S. japonicum. Macrophage depletion by GdCl3 during the initial phase attenuated liver pathological injury characterized by smaller granuloma size and decreased immune inflammation as well as less fibrogenesis. In addition, IL-13Rα2 expression was reduced by GdCl3 in liver of mice infected with S. japonicum. The results suggest that GdCl3 depleted macrophages, which attenuated helminth infected immune responses involving with IL-13Rα2 signal. These findings would highlight a therapeutic potential via manipulating IL-13Rα2+ macrophage in schistosomiasis."
