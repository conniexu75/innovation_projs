Teste et al. monitored growth and survival in Australian shrubland plant species paired with soil biota from plants of the same species and from other plants that use different nutrient acquisition strategies. Plant-soil feedbacks appear to drive local plant diversity through interactions between the different types of plants and their associated soil biota. Bennett et al. studied plant-soil feedbacks in soil and seeds from 550 populations of 55 species of North American trees. Feedbacks ranged from positive to negative, depending on the type of mycorrhizal association, and were related to how densely the same species occurred in natural populations.

We have recently learned much about spatial maps in the brain in which place cells indicate current location. However, it is unclear how navigational goals are represented in the brain. Sarel et al. describe a group of neurons in the brains of bats that are tuned to goal direction and distance relative to the bat's current position as it flies toward its goal. The finding elucidates the computations involved in spatial navigation. Science , this issue p. 176"

At the molecular level, however, synthetic knots have thus far been restricted to architectures accessible from two-strand braids.

For a six-carbon sugar such as glucose, there are six different possible linkage sites and also two possible configurations in which to anchor the incipient bond. Park et al. developed a ring-shaped, dimeric catalyst that pairs sugars after one of them has been modified with a chloride. The thiourea-based catalyst appears to pull away the chloride while simultaneously activating the incoming second sugar. The resultant bond-forming process reliably inverts the initial C–Cl configuration. Science , this issue p. 162"

However, the technique works better for atoms with higher atomic numbers and requires single crystals of a minimum size. Palatinus et al. used electron diffraction, a technique of increasing importance for analyzing very small crystals, to identify the positions of hydrogen atoms in organic and inorganic materials (see the Perspective by McCusker).

Chaikeeratisak et al. studied the replication of the very large Pseudomonas bacteriophage 201φ2-1 by using fluorescence microscopy and cryo–electron tomography. They found that the phage assembled a nucleus-like compartment when it infected a bacterial cell. The phage genome was completely enclosed by an apparently contiguous protein shell, within which DNA replication, recombination, and transcription occurred. Translation, precursor biosynthesis, and viral assembly occurred outside the structure. Science , this issue p. 194"

Prions have also been identified in fungi, where they act as protein-based elements of inheritance. Although prions have been uncovered in evolutionarily diverse eukaryotic species, it is not known whether prions exist in bacteria.

https://openalex.org/W2577956156,"The claim that Ward's linkage algorithm in hierarchical clustering is limited to use with Euclidean distances is investigated. In this paper, Ward's clustering algorithm is generalised to use with l1 norm or Manhattan distances. We argue that the generalisation of Ward's linkage method to incorporate Manhattan distances is theoretically sound and provide an example of where this method outperforms the method using Euclidean distances. As an application, we perform statistical analyses on languages using methods normally applied to biology and genetic classification. We aim to quantify differences in character traits between languages and use a statistical language signature based on relative bi-gram (sequence of two letters) frequencies to calculate a distance matrix between 32 Indo-European languages. We then use Ward's method of hierarchical clustering to classify the languages, using the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance. Results obtained from using the different distance metrics are compared to show that the Ward's algorithm characteristic of minimising intra-cluster variation and maximising inter-cluster variation is not violated when using the Manhattan metric."
https://openalex.org/W2571848202,"Parallel computation in memory-making The hippocampus plays a central role in the encoding, consolidation, and recall of memories. Consolidation and recall are thought to be executed by the replay of previously acquired memory traces by hippocampal cell assemblies. The hippocampus is thus considered to be the initiator of memory redistribution processes. However, O'Neill et al. now report that the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex show replay events that are independent of hippocampal activity (see the Perspective by Moser and Gardner). Computations in memory systems may thus be organized in a less hierarchical, more parallel way than previously thought. Science , this issue p. 184 ; see also p. 131"

For example, curved b sheets are a common ligand binding motif. Marcos et al. investigated the principles that drive β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in natural proteins and folding simulations. In a step toward custom design of enzyme catalysts, they used these principles to control β-sheet geometry and design proteins with differently shaped cavities. Science , this issue p. 201"

For metamemory, we need access to information about the strength of our own memory traces. The brain structures and neural mechanisms involved in metamemory are completely unknown. Miyamoto et al. devised a test paradigm for metamemory in macaques, in which the monkeys judged their own confidence in remembering past experiences. The authors combined this approach with functional brain imaging to reveal the neural substrates of metamemory for retrospection. A specific region in the prefrontal brain was essential for meta mnemonic decision-making. Inactivation of this region caused selective impairment of metamemory, but not of memory itself.

https://openalex.org/W2576775040,"To increase the removal of middle-sized uremic toxins a new membrane with enhanced permeability and selectivity, called Medium Cut-Off membrane (MCO-Ci) has been developed that at the same time ensures the retention of albumin. Because many middle-sized substances may contribute to micro-inflammation we hypothesized that the use of MCO-Ci influences the inflammatory state in hemodialysis patients.The randomized crossover trial in 48 patients compared MCO-Ci dialysis to High-flux dialysis of 4 weeks duration each plus 8 weeks extension phase. Primary endpoint was the gene expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), secondary endpoints were plasma levels of specified inflammatory mediators and cytokines.After four weeks of MCO-Ci the expression of TNF-α mRNA (Relative quantification (RQ) from 0.92 ± 0.34 to 0.75 ± 0.31, -18.5%, p<0.001)-α and IL-6 mRNA (RQ from 0.78 ± 0.80 to 0.60 ± 0.43, -23.1%, p<0.01) was reduced to a significantly greater extent than with High-flux dialyzers (TNF mRNA-RQ: -14.3%; IL-6 mRNA-RQ: -3.5%). After retransformation of logarithmically transformed data, measurements after MCO were reduced to 82% of those after HF (95% CI 74%-91%). 4 weeks use of MCO-Ci resulted in long-lasting change in plasma levels of several cytokines and other substances with a significant decrease for sTNFR1, kappa and lambda free light chains, urea and an increase for Lp-PLA2 (PLA2G7) compared to High-flux. Albumin levels dropped significantly after 4 weeks of MCO dialysis but increased after additional 8 weeks of MCO dialysis. Twelve weeks treatment with MCO-Ci was well tolerated regarding the number of (S)AEs. In the extension period levels of CRP, TNF-α-mRNA and IL-6 mRNA remained stable in High-flux as well as in MCO-Ci.MCO-Ci dialyzers modulate inflammation in chronic HD patients to a greater extent compared to High-flux dialyzers. Transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral leukocytes is markedly reduced and removal of soluble mediators is enhanced with MCO dialysis. Serum albumin concentrations stabilize after an initial drop. These results encourage further trials with longer treatment periods and clinical endpoints."
https://openalex.org/W2577135743,"The small molecule drug omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) specifically targets cardiac muscle myosin and is known to enhance cardiac muscle performance, yet its impact on human cardiac myosin motor function is unclear. We expressed and purified human β-cardiac myosin subfragment 1 (M2β-S1) containing a C-terminal Avi tag. We demonstrate that the maximum actin-activated ATPase activity of M2β-S1 is slowed more than 4-fold in the presence of OM, whereas the actin concentration required for half-maximal ATPase was reduced dramatically (30-fold). We find OM does not change the overall actin affinity. Transient kinetic experiments suggest that there are two kinetic pathways in the presence of OM. The dominant pathway results in a slow transition between actomyosin·ADP states and increases the time myosin is strongly bound to actin. However, OM also traps a population of myosin heads in a weak actin affinity state with slow product release. We demonstrate that OM can reduce the actin sliding velocity more than 100-fold in the in vitro motility assay. The ionic strength dependence of in vitro motility suggests the inhibition may be at least partially due to drag forces from weakly attached myosin heads. OM causes an increase in duty ratio examined in the motility assay. Experiments with permeabilized human myocardium demonstrate that OM increases calcium sensitivity and slows force development (ktr) in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the maximally activated force is unchanged. We propose that OM increases the myosin duty ratio, which results in enhanced calcium sensitivity but slower force development in human myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2578761134,"Mitochondrial gene expression is a fundamental process that is largely dependent on nuclear-encoded proteins. Several steps of mitochondrial RNA processing and maturation, including RNA post-transcriptional modification, appear to be spatially organized into distinct foci, which we have previously termed mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs). Although an increasing number of proteins have been localized to MRGs, a comprehensive analysis of the proteome of these structures is still lacking. Here, we have applied a microscopy-based approach that has allowed us to identify novel components of the MRG proteome. Among these, we have focused our attention on RPUSD4, an uncharacterized mitochondrial putative pseudouridine synthase. We show that RPUSD4 depletion leads to a severe reduction of the steady-state level of the 16S mitochondrial (mt) rRNA with defects in the biogenesis of the mitoribosome large subunit and consequently in mitochondrial translation. We report that RPUSD4 binds 16S mt-rRNA, mt-tRNAMet, and mt-tRNAPhe, and we demonstrate that it is responsible for pseudouridylation of the latter. These data provide new insights into the relevance of RNA pseudouridylation in mitochondrial gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2579027303,"Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a catabolic cellular self-eating process by which unwanted organelles or proteins are delivered to lysosomes for degradation through autophagosomes. Although the role of autophagy in cancer has been shown to be context-dependent, the role of autophagy in tumor cell survival has attracted great interest in targeting autophagy for cancer therapy. One family of potential autophagy blockers is the quinoline-derived antimalarial family, including chloroquine (CQ). However, the molecular basis for tumor cell response to CQ remains poorly understood. We show here that in both squamous cell carcinoma cells and melanoma tumor cells, CQ induced NF-κB activation and the expression of its target genes HIF-1α, IL-8, BCL-2, and BCL-XL through the accumulation of autophagosomes, p62, and JNK signaling. The activation of NF-κB further increased p62 gene expression. Either genetic knockdown of p62 or inhibition of NF-κB sensitized tumor cells to CQ, resulting in increased apoptotic cell death following treatment. Our findings provide new molecular insights into the CQ response in tumor cells and CQ resistance in cancer therapy. These findings may facilitate development of improved therapeutic strategies by targeting the p62/NF-κB pathway."

Resistance to B. thuringiensis toxins threatens this technology, and although different resistance mechanisms have been identified, some have not been completely elucidated. To gain new insights into these mechanisms, we performed multiple back-crossing from a 3000-fold Cry1Ac-resistant BtR strain from cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), isolating a 516-fold Cry1Ac-resistant strain (96CAD). Cry1Ac resistance in 96CAD was tightly linked to a mutant cadherin allele (mHaCad) that contained 35 amino acid substitutions compared with HaCad from a susceptible strain (96S). We observed significantly reduced levels of the mHaCad protein on the surface of the midgut epithelium in 96CAD as compared with 96S. Expression of both cadherin alleles from 96CAD and 96S in insect cells and immunofluorescence localization in insect midgut tissue sections showed that the HaCAD protein from 96S localizes on the cell membrane, whereas the mutant 96CAD-mHaCad was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mapping of the mutations identified a D172G substitution mainly responsible for cadherin mislocalization.

It therefore forms an excellent model for in-depth biodiversity studies, assessing morphological and genetic differentiation among groups of strains. The global Chaetoceros lorenzianus complex presently comprises three species known to science. However, our recent studies have shown that the group includes several previously unknown species. In this article, 50 strains, mainly from high latitudes and from warm-temperate waters, were examined morphologically and genetically and the results compared with those of field studies from elsewhere. The strains clustered into five groups, two of which are formed by C. decipiens Cleve and C. mitra (Bailey) Cleve, respectively. Their species descriptions are emended based on samples collected close to the type localities. The three other groups are formed by new species, C. elegans sp. nov., C. laevisporus sp. nov. and C. mannaii sp. nov. Characters used to distinguish each species are: orientation of setae, shape and size of the apertures, shape, size and density of the poroids on the setae and, at least in some species, characters of the resting spores. Our aim is to cover the global species diversity in this complex, as correct species delineation is the basis for exploring biodiversity, distribution of organisms, interactions in the food web and effects of environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2579011670,"Mast cells are secretory cells that play an important role in host defense by discharging various intragranular contents, such as histamine and serotonin, upon stimulation of Fc receptors. The granules also contain spermine and spermidine, which can act as modulators of mast cell function, although the mechanism underlying vesicular storage remains unknown. Vesicular polyamine transporter (VPAT), the fourth member of the SLC18 transporter family, is an active transporter responsible for vesicular storage of spermine and spermidine in neurons. In the present study, we investigated whether VPAT functions in mast cells. RT-PCR and Western blotting indicated VPAT expression in murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that VPAT is colocalized with VAMP3 but not with histamine, serotonin, cathepsin D, VAMP2, or VAMP7. Membrane vesicles from BMMCs accumulated spermidine upon the addition of ATP in a reserpine- and bafilomycin A1-sensitive manner. BMMCs secreted spermine and spermidine upon the addition of either antigen or A23187 in the presence of Ca2+, and the antigen-mediated release, which was shown to be temperature-dependent and sensitive to bafilomycin A1 and tetanus toxin, was significantly suppressed by VPAT gene RNA interference. Under these conditions, expression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 was unaffected, but antigen-dependent histamine release was significantly suppressed, which was recovered by the addition of 1 mm spermine. These results strongly suggest that VPAT is expressed and is responsible for vesicular storage of spermine and spermidine in novel secretory granules that differ from histamine- and serotonin-containing granules and is involved in vesicular release of these polyamines from mast cells.

https://openalex.org/W2576948207,"The nuclease ARTEMIS is essential for the development of B and T lymphocytes. It is required for opening DNA hairpins generated during antigen receptor gene assembly from variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) subgenic elements (V(D)J recombination). As a member of the non-homologous end-joining pathway, it is also involved in repairing a subset of pathological DNA double strand breaks. Loss of ARTEMIS function therefore results in radiosensitive severe combined immunodeficiency (RS-SCID). The hairpin opening activity is dependent on the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which can bind to and phosphorylate ARTEMIS. The ARTEMIS C terminus is dispensable for cellular V(D)J recombination and in vitro nuclease assays with C-terminally truncated ARTEMIS showing DNA-PKcs-independent hairpin opening activity. Therefore, it has been postulated that ARTEMIS is regulated via autoinhibition by its C terminus. To obtain evidence for the autoinhibition model, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with combinations of ARTEMIS mutants. We show that an N-terminal fragment comprising the catalytic domain can interact both with itself and with a C-terminal fragment. Amino acid exchanges N456A+S457A+E458Q in the C terminus of full-length ARTEMIS resulted in unmasking of the N terminus and in increased ARTEMIS activity in cellular V(D)J recombination assays. Mutations in ARTEMIS-deficient patients impaired the interaction with the C terminus and also affected protein stability. The interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains was not DNA-PKcs-dependent, and phosphomimetic mutations in the C-terminal domain did not result in unmasking of the catalytic domain. Our experiments provide strong evidence that a physical interaction between the C-terminal and catalytic domains mediates ARTEMIS autoinhibition."

IQGAP1 is a scaffold protein that interacts with multiple binding partners and integrates diverse signaling cascades. Here we show that IQGAP1 associates with both IR and IRS-1 and influences insulin action. In vitro analysis with pure proteins revealed that the IQ region of IQGAP1 binds directly to the intracellular domain of IR. Similarly, the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of IRS-1 mediates a direct interaction with the C-terminal tail of IQGAP1. Consistent with these observations, both IR and IRS-1 co-immunoprecipitated with IQGAP1 from cells. Investigation of the functional effects of the interactions revealed that in the absence of IQGAP1, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, as well as the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1, were significantly decreased. Importantly, loss of IQGAP1 results in impaired insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis in vivo.

Previous studies have shown that iron-sulfur clusters hosted by cysteine residues in proteins are readily disrupted by nitric oxide forming a protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complex, thiolate-bridged di-iron tetranitrosyl complex, or octanitrosyl cluster. Here we report that human mitochondrial protein Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters can bind nitric oxide without disruption of the clusters. Miner2 is a member of a new CDGSH iron-sulfur protein family that also includes two mitochondrial proteins: the type II diabetes-related mitoNEET and the Wolfram syndrome 2-linked Miner1. Miner2 contains two CDGSH motifs, and each CDGSH motif hosts a [2Fe-2S] cluster via three cysteine and one histidine residues. Binding of nitric oxide in the reduced Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters produces a major absorption peak at 422 nm without releasing iron or sulfide from the clusters. The EPR measurements and mass spectrometry analyses further reveal that nitric oxide binds to the reduced [2Fe-2S] clusters in Miner2, with each cluster binding one nitric oxide. Although the [2Fe-2S] cluster in purified human mitoNEET and Miner1 fails to bind nitric oxide, a single mutation of Asp-96 to Val in mitoNEET or Asp-123 to Val in Miner1 facilitates nitric oxide binding in the [2Fe-2S] cluster, indicating that a subtle change of protein structure may switch mitoNEET and Miner1 to bind nitric oxide.

Although mitochondrial Miner2 is found to be highly expressed in lung cancer, breast cancer, and other types of cancer (Cancer Browser), it has not been purified or characterized previously, and very little is known about the function of Miner2 in mitochondria. Nevertheless, the crystal structure of the Miner2 homolog from Magnetospirillum magneticum shows that Miner2 is a monomer that hosts two [2Fe-2S] clusters via two CDGSH motifs in an internal pseudodyad symmetry (3Lin J.

In mitochondria, nitric oxide has been shown to modulate energy metabolism by interacting with iron-sulfur clusters and hemes in proteins (27Brown G.C. Nitric oxide and mitochondria.Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).

In all of these examples, iron-sulfur clusters in proteins are hosted by either cysteine residues (33Duan X. Yang J. Ren B. Tan G. Ding H. Reactivity of nitric oxide with the [4Fe-4S] cluster of dihydroxyacid dehydratase from Escherichia coli.Biochem.

Dinitrosyl iron complexes relevant to Rieske cluster nitrosylation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 7964-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we report that the CDGSH-type [2Fe-2S] clusters in the human mitochondrial protein Miner2 can bind nitric oxide without disruption of the clusters. Although the [2Fe-2S] cluster in purified human mitoNEET and Miner1 fails to bind nitric oxide, a single mutation of Asp-96 to Val in mitoNEET or Asp-123 to Val in Miner1 facilitates nitric oxide binding in the [2Fe-2S] clusters, indicating that a subtle change of protein structure may switch mitoNEET and Miner1 to bind nitric oxide at the [2Fe-2S] cluster. The results suggest that binding of nitric oxide in the CDGSH-type [2Fe-2S] clusters in mitochondrial protein Miner2 may represent a novel nitric oxide signaling mode in cells. The recombinant human mitochondrial CDGSH proteins mitoNEET, Miner1, and Miner2 were prepared from Escherichia coli cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1A shows that purified human mitoNEET, Miner1, and Miner2 had a similar UV-visible absorption spectrum, with two major absorption peaks at 458 and 550 nm, indicative of the oxidized [2Fe-2S] clusters in each protein (35Landry A.P. Cheng Z. Ding H. Reduction of mitochondrial protein mitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters by human glutathione reductase.Free Radic Biol. Med. 2015; 81: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When purified proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol under anaerobic conditions (17Landry A.P. Ding H.

Chem. 2014; 289: 4307-4315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), mitoNEET and Miner1 had an identical EPR spectrum with g = 1.94 of the reduced [2Fe-2S] clusters (Fig. 1B), as reported previously (35Landry A.P.

This is likely because mitoNEET and Miner1 have 54% identity and 76% similarity (5Conlan A.R. Axelrod H.L. Cohen A.E. Abresch E.C. Zuris J. Yee D. Nechushtai R. Jennings P.A. Paddock M.L. Crystal structure of Miner1: the redox-active 2Fe-2S protein causative in Wolfram syndrome 2.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, the reduced Miner2 appeared to have two overlapping EPR spectra (Fig. 1B). Deconvolution of the EPR spectrum of the reduced Miner2 produced two distinct EPR spectra with g = 1.92 and g = 1.94, respectively (Fig. 1C), suggesting that human Miner2, like the Miner2 homolog from M. magneticum (3Lin J. Zhang L. Lai S. Ye K. Structure and molecular evolution of CDGSH iron-sulfur domains.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e24790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), hosts two [2Fe-2S] clusters via two CDGSH motifs. As the redox midpoint potential (Em7) of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in mitoNEET is about 0 mV (37Bak D.W. Zuris J.A. Paddock M.L. Jennings P.A. Elliott S.J. Redox characterization of the FeS protein MitoNEET and impact of thiazolidinedione drug binding.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10193-10195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the CDGSH-type [2Fe-2S] clusters in proteins are most likely in a reduced state in cells under normal physiological conditions (17Landry A.P. Ding H. Redox control of human mitochondrial outer membrane protein MitoNEET [2Fe-2S] clusters by biological thiols and hydrogen peroxide.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 4307-4315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To explore the interaction between the mitochondrial CDGSH proteins and nitric oxide, purified mitoNEET, Miner1, and Miner2 were prereduced with dithiothreitol before being exposed to nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. When reduced mitoNEET or Miner1 was treated with a 2-fold excess of nitric oxide (from a nitric oxide gas-saturated solution), the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in mitoNEET (Fig. 2A) or Miner1 (Fig. 2B) was not significantly changed, indicating that the [2Fe-2S] cluster in mitoNEET or Miner1 did not interact with nitric oxide under the experimental conditions. In contrast, when reduced Miner2 was treated with a 2-fold excess of nitric oxide, a new absorption peak at 422 nm appeared (Fig. 2C). No detectable amount of iron or sulfide was released from the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters after nitric oxide treatment (data not shown), indicating that nitric oxide may bind to the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters without disrupting them. In a control experiment, when reduced apo-Miner2 (Miner2 without the [2Fe-2S] clusters) was treated with a 2-fold excess of nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions, no absorption peak at 422 nm was observed (data not shown), further suggesting that the absorption peak at 422 nm is likely due to the interaction between the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters and nitric oxide. Under the same experimental conditions, E. coli SoxR, which hosts a [2Fe-2S] cluster via four cysteine residues (38Watanabe S. Kita A. Kobayashi K. Miki K. Crystal structure of the [2Fe-2S] oxidative-stress sensor SoxR bound to DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4121-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was treated with a 2-fold excess of nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. Fig. 2D shows that the absorption peaks at 414 and 462 nm of the SoxR [2Fe-2S] clusters were largely eliminated, with no appearance of the absorption peak at 422 nm after nitric oxide treatment, confirming that the SoxR [2Fe-2S] clusters were disrupted by nitric oxide forming a protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complex, as reported previously (20Ding H. Demple B. Direct nitric oxide signal transduction via nitrosylation of iron-sulfur centers in the SoxR transcription activator.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters have a unique interaction with nitric oxide. To further explore the interaction between the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters and nitric oxide, Miner2 was prereduced with dithiothreitol, followed by stepwise addition of nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. UV-visible absorption spectra were taken after each addition of nitric oxide. Fig. 3A shows that, as the nitric oxide concentration increased in the incubation solution, the absorption peak at 422 nm gradually increased. The amplitude of the absorption peak at 422 nm was almost linearly proportional to the nitric oxide concentration in the incubation solution. An about 2-fold excess of nitric oxide over Miner2 was sufficient to saturate the nitric oxide binding in the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters (Fig. 3B), indicating that the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters have a strong binding affinity for nitric oxide. In parallel experiments, after reduced Miner2 was treated with stepwise addition of nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions, samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and subjected to EPR measurements. Fig. 3C shows that, as nitric oxide concentration increased in the incubation solution, the EPR signal at g = 1.92 of the reduced Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters gradually decreased. At 2-fold excess of nitric oxide over Miner2, the EPR signal at g = 1.92 was largely eliminated. A small EPR signal at g = 2.03, indicative of a protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complex (26Landry A.P. Duan X. Huang H. Ding H. Iron-sulfur proteins are the major source of protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complexes formed in Escherichia coli cells under nitric oxide stress.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 50: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. An EPR investigation of the products of the reaction of cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases with nitric oxide.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), appeared after the Miner2 was treated with nitric oxide (Fig. 3C). However, spin quantification of the EPR signal at g = 2.04 showed that less than 5% of the reduced Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters might be converted to the dinitrosyl iron complex, suggesting that the majority of the reduced Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters became EPR-silent after being treated with a 2-fold excess of nitric oxide. To further test the idea that nitric oxide binds to the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters, the nitric oxide-treated Miner2 was repurified from the incubation solution by passing the protein sample through a High-Trap desalting column. Repurified Miner2 was then treated with 0.2 m HCl to release the acid-labile iron and sulfide from iron-sulfur clusters in the protein. Fig. 3D shows that more than 80% of the acid-labile iron and sulfide content remained with Miner2 after being treated with a 2-fold excess of nitric oxide. Thus, nitric oxide may eliminate the EPR signal at g = 1.92 of the reduced Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters by directly binding to the clusters. l-cysteine has been used to release nitric oxide (in the form of nitrite) from the protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complex under aerobic conditions (26Landry A.P. Duan X. Huang H. Ding H. Iron-sulfur proteins are the major source of protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complexes formed in Escherichia coli cells under nitric oxide stress.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 50: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To probe the nitric oxide binding in the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters, the nitric oxide-treated Miner2 was repurified and incubated with l-cysteine at 37 °C under aerobic conditions for 30 min. Nitrite released from Miner2 was measured using Griess reagents (26Landry A.P. Duan X. Huang H. Ding H. Iron-sulfur proteins are the major source of protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complexes formed in Escherichia coli cells under nitric oxide stress.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 50: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 3D shows that nitrite was indeed released when the nitric oxide-treated Miner2 was incubated with 10 mm l-cysteine under aerobic conditions. The ratio of nitrite to total iron in the nitric oxide-treated Miner2 was about 0.41 ± 0.12, indicating that each [2Fe-2S] cluster in Miner2 binds about one nitric oxide. For Miner2 without nitric oxide treatment, no detectable amount of nitrite was observed after incubation with 10 mm l-cysteine. Mass spectrometry was further used to analyze the nitric oxide binding in the Miner2 [2Fe-2S] clusters. Fig. 4A shows that purified Miner2 had a major peak at a molecular weight of 10,878, which is the sum of the expected molecular weight of apo-Miner2 (10,526) plus 2 × [2Fe-2S] clusters (352). When Miner2 was exposed to a 2-fold excess of nitric oxide, the peak at 10,878 was largely eliminated and replaced with two new peaks at molecular weights of 10,878 + 30 and 10,878 + 60, respectively (Fig. 4A). As the molecular weight of nitric oxide is 30, two new peaks were assigned to the Miner2 with only one [2Fe-2S] cluster bound with nitric oxide and the one with both [2Fe-2S] clusters"
https://openalex.org/W2576652718,"The evolution of ecological idiosyncrasies in Madagascar has often been attributed to selective pressures stemming from extreme unpredictability in climate and resource availability compared to other tropical areas. With the exception of rainfall, few studies have investigated these assumptions. To assess the hypothesis that Madagascar's paucity of frugivores is due to unreliability in fruiting resources, we use statistical modeling to analyze phenology datasets and their environmental correlates from two tropical wet forests, the Réserve Naturelle Intégrale Betampona in Madagascar, and Kibale National Park in Uganda. At each site we found that temperature is a good environmental predictor of fruit availability. We found no evidence of a significant difference in the predictability of fruit availability between the two sites, although the shorter duration of phenological monitoring at Betampona (two years, versus 15 years at Kibale) limits our ability to infer long-term patterns. Comparisons of long-term temperature data from each site (15 years from Kibale and 14 from Betampona) indicate that temperature is more predictable at Betampona than at Kibale. However, there does appear to be a difference between the two sites in the total fruit availability at any given time, with fruit being generally less abundant at Betampona. Our results appear contrary to the prevailing hypothesis of a selective force imposed by unpredictable resource availability or temperature, and we suggest other possible explanations for Madagascar's unique biota."

https://openalex.org/W2579365940,"Appreciation of the importance of the microbiome is increasing, as sequencing technology has made it possible to ascertain the microbial content of a variety of samples. Studies that sequence the 16S rRNA gene, ubiquitous in and nearly exclusive to bacteria, have proliferated in the medical literature. After sequences are binned into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or species, data from these studies are summarized in a data matrix with the observed counts from each OTU for each sample. Analysis often reduces these data further to a matrix of pairwise distances or dissimilarities; plotting the first two or three principal components (PCs) of this distance matrix often reveals meaningful groupings in the data. However, once the distance matrix is calculated, it is no longer clear which OTUs or species are important to the observed clustering; further, the PCs are hard to interpret and cannot be calculated for subsequent observations. We show how to construct approximate decompositions of the data matrix that pair PCs with linear combinations of OTU or species frequencies, and show how these decompositions can be used to construct biplots, select important OTUs and partition the variability in the data matrix into contributions corresponding to PCs of an arbitrary distance or dissimilarity matrix. To illustrate our approach, we conduct an analysis of the bacteria found in 45 smokeless tobacco samples."
https://openalex.org/W2553755205,"The packaging of genomic DNA into nucleosomes creates a barrier to transcription that can be relieved through ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling via complexes such as the switch-sucrose non-fermentable (SWI-SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. The SWI-SNF complex remodels chromatin via conformational or positional changes of nucleosomes, thereby altering the access of transcriptional machinery to target genes. The SWI-SNF complex has limited ability to bind to sequence-specific elements, and, therefore, its recruitment to target loci is believed to require interaction with DNA-associated transcription factors. The Cdx family of homeodomain transcript ion factors (Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4) are essential for a number of developmental programs in the mouse. Cdx1 and Cdx2 also regulate intestinal homeostasis throughout life. Although a number of Cdx target genes have been identified, the basis by which Cdx members impact their transcription is poorly understood. We have found that Cdx members interact with the SWI-SNF complex and make direct contact with Brg1, a catalytic member of SWI-SNF. Both Cdx2 and Brg1 co-occupy a number of Cdx target genes, and both factors are necessary for transcriptional regulation of such targets. Finally, Cdx2 and Brg1 occupancy occurs coincident with chromatin remodeling at some of these loci. Taken together, our findings suggest that Cdx transcription factors regulate target gene expression, in part, through recruitment of Brg1-associated SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling activity."

Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5799) Google Scholar). Although p53 orchestrates more than 100 target genes, it is usually retained in an “off” state because of its rapid turnover (2Wei C.L. Wu Q. Vega V.B. Chiu K.P. Ng P. Zhang T. Shahab A. Yong H.C.

The p53-MDM2 interplay forms the basis of p53 dynamics, and several transcription-related factors regulate p53 activity (11Beckerman R. Prives C. Transcriptional regulation by p53.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2a000935Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Upon genotoxic stresses, p53 is phosphorylated at Thr-18 and Ser-20, both of which are critical for MDM2 binding, leading to the dissociation of the p53-MDM2 interaction (12Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y.

Zhao W. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Gu W. Acetylation is indispensable for p53 activation.Cell. 2008; 133: 612-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Activated p53 in turn induces the expression of MDM2. High levels of MDM2 associate with HDAC1 and deacetylate p53 to promote its degradation (16Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J.

In the late phase of the stress response, TBP-associated factor 1 (TAF1), the largest subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIID, phosphorylates p53 at Thr-55 and dissociates p53 from the p21 promoter by elevating MDM2 binding affinity of p53 (17Li H.H.

In addition, some unknown transcription-related factors may also be involved in p53 regulation, and identification of a novel regulator of the p53-MDM2 interplay is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying p53 dynamics. TLP is a member of the TBP family and is also named TBP-related factor 2 (TRF2) and TBP-like 1 (TBPL1) (19Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4791-4796Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TLP has 38% identity to the C-terminal conserved region of TBP and mimics the function of a basal transcription factor in the regulation of various biological processes (21Zehavi Y. Kedmi A. Ideses D. Juven-Gershon T. TRF2: TRansForming the view of general transcription factors.Transcription. 2015; 6: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TLP, but not TBP, is associated with a number of TATA-less promoters and mediates RNA polymerase II-driven transcription from those promoters including ribosomal protein genes (22Wang Y.L. Duttke S.H. Chen K. Johnston J. Kassavetis G.A. Zeitlinger J. Kadonaga J.T. TRF2, but not TBP, mediates the transcription of ribosomal protein genes.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Upon genotoxic stress, TLP represses cell growth via regulation of cell cycle-associated genes such as wee1, Cdkn1a (p21), and Trp63 (23Tanaka Y. Nanba Y.A. Park K.A. Mabuchi T. Suenaga Y.

We have also found that TLP binds to the TAD of p53, as does TBP, and enhances p21 expression in a p53-dependent manner (25Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T.

However, little is known about the most fundamental question of how TLP regulates p53 target genes or p53 itself. Here we aimed to investigate the role of TLP in p53 regulation and present evidence that TLP is a new regulatory factor of the p53-MDM2 interplay. In the genotoxic stress response, TLP promotes p53-driven apoptosis and senescence by mediating persistent p53 activation. TLP binds to the p53 TAD and inhibits MDM2 recruitment to p53, which results in suppression of p53 ubiquitination. We also aimed to real time chasing of p53 nuclear export and show that TLP is essential for suppressing MDM2-driven nuclear export of p53. Moreover, a cervical cancer-derived TLP mutant has little p53 binding ability and does not suppress cell growth. Taken together, our findings indicate that TLP disrupts the p53-MDM2 interaction and mediates long-lasting p53 activation in response to genotoxic stress. To explore the role of TLP in p53 function, we first investigated the effects of TLP knockdown on the expression of p53 protein. Both transient and stable knockdown of TLP caused a decrease in p53 protein (Fig. 1, A and B). This decrease was recovered in the short interfering RNAs (siRNA)-resistant TLP (TLPesc)-added HCT116 cells (Fig. 1A). The effect of TLP knockdown was evident based on accelerated cell growth in both TLP siRNA-transfected HCT and HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether TLP regulates p53 at the protein level, we then chased the breakdown of p53 protein using cycloheximide (CHX). Overexpression of TLP increased the stability of p53 in both HCT116 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1D), whereas knockdown of TLP decreased the stability (Fig. 1E). Consistently, TLP-depleted cells contained decreased amounts of p53 targets such as MDM2 and p21 at the protein level (Fig. 1E). The same phenomenon was also observed at the mRNA level, and p53-up-regulated genes and p53-down-regulated genes were decreased and elevated, respectively (Fig. 1F). In contrast, although TLP depletion decreased p53 protein levels, its transcripts were not decreased (Fig. 1F). Additionally, CHX treatment decreased the levels of p53 protein, whereas treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased it (Fig. 1G). Overexpressed p53 was also decreased through TLP knockdown in p53-null HCT116 cells (Fig. 1H). Moreover, TLP knockdown in p53-null HCT116 cells did not change the levels of p21 transcript, and the effect of TLP knockdown shown in wild-type HCT116 cells was also observed in the case of p53 overexpression (Fig. 1I). These results suggest that TLP up-regulates p53 at the protein level, which results in inhibition of cell growth through control of p53 target genes. Next, to investigate whether TLP enhances p53 function in response to genotoxic stress, we examined TLP function under UV irradiation. When TLP short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing HCT116 cells were exposed to various doses of UV light and incubated for 36 h, the levels of transcripts of p53 target genes including p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 2A) were less induced compared with control cells. To assess the interplay between p53 and TLP in response to UV irradiation, we chased the expression dynamics of p53 and its target proteins after a high dose (50 J/m2) of UV irradiation. The protein levels of both total p53 and Lys-382-acetylated p53, which is an activation marker for p53 transcriptional activity, were elevated within 4 h and decreased around 32–36 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 2B). Notably, TLP was significantly elevated around 32–36 h, and depletion of TLP accelerated the decrease of both total p53 and Lys-382-acetylated p53 during these time points (Fig. 2B, bottom). Consistent with these results, the levels of p21 protein were not elevated in TLP-depleted cells (Fig. 2B, bottom). We then examined the expression of p53-up-regulated target genes related to cell cycle arrest (p21, 14-3-3σ) and apoptosis (PUMA, Fas) and the expression of p53-down-regulated targets participating in cell proliferation (CDC20, FOXM1) after UV irradiation (Fig. 2C). TLP-depleted cells clearly showed the reduction of p53 transcriptional activity in the late phase (at 32–48 h) of the UV response (Fig. 2C). In contrast, TLP mRNA was not significantly elevated (Fig. 2C; p = 0.14, analysis of variance) although its protein was up-regulated in the late phase of the UV response (Fig. 2B, bottom). This finding suggests that TLP is regulated at the protein level and is not a p53 target. We also investigated whether p53 and TLP are recruited to the promoters of representative p53 target genes. After UV irradiation, p53 was detected on the p21, PUMA, and MDM2 promoters (Fig. 2D). As expected, the recruitment of p53 to these promoters was considerably reduced in the late phase of UV response of TLP-depleted cells (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the levels of p53 protein reflect its occupation at these promoters. On the other hand, the recruitment of TLP to those promoters was not obvious (Fig. 2E), suggesting that TLP promotes p53 protein stability but not p53 recruitment to those promoters. Finally, we investigated the viability and senescent state of the cells after UV irradiation. Under this condition, the viability of TLP knockdown cells was more than three times higher than that of control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, TLP-depleted cells exhibited resistance to senescence after UV irradiation (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that TLP elongates the duration of p53 activation to promote apoptosis and senescence in response to the genotoxic stress. To elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which TLP potentiates p53 activity, we investigated the involvement of MDM2 in the p53-TLP interplay. Overexpression of TLP and MDM2 increased and decreased the levels of p53, respectively (Fig. 4A). In addition, overexpression of both proteins canceled each effect (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, a p53 mutant L22Q/S23S (QS), which is defective in MDM2-binding, did not decrease when TLP was knocked down (Fig. 4B). An in vivo p53 ubiquitination assay showed that the amount of ubiquitinated p53 decreased depending on the TLP expression level (Fig. 4C). This phenomenon became more evident when MDM2 was coexpressed (Fig. 4D). TLP has been shown to bind to the p53 TAD (27Maeda R. Suzuki H. Tanaka Y. Tamura T. Interaction between transactivation domain of p53 and middle part of TBP-like protein (TLP) is involved in TLP-stimulated and p53-activated transcription from the p21 upstream promoter.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e90190Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); hence, we hypothesized that TLP prevents p53 binding of MDM2. To evaluate the above hypothesis, we performed a competitive pulldown assay using a p53 binding ability-defective MDM2 mutant protein, G58A (Fig. 4E) (28Freedman D.A. Epstein C.B. Roth J.C. Levine A.J. A genetic approach to mapping the p53 binding site in the MDM2 protein.Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 248-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When wild-type MDM2 was added to the reaction mixture of the GST pulldown assay, the amount of p53-bound TLP was decreased, whereas the G58A mutant interfered with the TLP binding of p53 only slightly (Fig. 4F). We then performed an immunoprecipitation assay for p53 and found that p53-bound MDM2 decreased with increases in p53-bound TLP (Fig. 4G). This suggests that TLP and MDM2 competitively bind to p53 in cells. TLP and MDM2 did not form a complex with p53 simultaneously because TLP and MDM2 were not co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4H). These results indicate that TLP stabilizes p53 protein by interfering with MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 4I). Next, to scrutinize the involvement of TLP in MDM2 function in cells, we examined the localization of endogenous p53. Most of the p53 and exogenous TLP were localized in the nucleus of HCT116 cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, TLP knockdown cells showed increased cytoplasmic localization of p53 (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that TLP retains p53 in the nucleus. To clarify whether TLP blocks MDM2-mediated nuclear export of p53, we performed a real-time nuclear export assay using the photoswitchable protein, Dronpa (Fig. 5C) (29Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Regulated fast nucleocytoplasmic shuttling observed by reversible protein highlighting.Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Low levels of p53-Dronpa were successfully induced in HeLa cells (Fig. 5, D and E). We confirmed that cytoplasmic localization of p53-Dronpa was emphasized in TLP knockdown cells (Fig. 5F). After treatment with CHX and MG132, fluorescence of p53-Dronpa in a whole cell was erased at 488 nm. Fluorescence in the nucleus was then reactivated through excitation at 405 nm (Fig. 5G). The flux of the florescence of Dronpa was monitored as an indicator of nuclear export. As for control shRNA-expressing cells, <10% of p53-Dronpa was exported to the cytoplasm within 720 s after photoactivation (Fig. 5, H and I, left). In contrast, nuclear export of p53-Dronpa in TLP shRNA-expressing cells was greatly accelerated. We also performed the same experiment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B and MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a to disrupt the p53-MDM2 interaction (7Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. The MDM2 RING-finger domain is required to promote p53 nuclear export.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 30Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D.

In vivo activation of the p53 pathway by small-molecule antagonists of MDM2.Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3784) Google Scholar). Leptomycin B-treated cells showed that p53-Dronpa was retained in the nucleus regardless of TLP depletion (Fig. 5I, middle). Similarly, Nutlin-3a blocked the nuclear export of p53-Dronpa in TLP knockdown cells (Fig. 5I, right), indicating that p53 nuclear export observed in TLP knockdown cells is dependent on MDM2. Taken together, these results suggest that TLP retains p53 in the nucleus by suppressing MDM2-driven nuclear export of p53. To explore the physiological significance of our findings, we assessed the role of TLP in cancer. We first investigated the involvement of TLP in the growth of xenograft tumors. 25 days after injection the weight of TLP-depleted HCT116-derived tumors was significantly higher than that of control HCT116-derived tumors (Fig. 6A), indicating that depletion of intracellular TLP accelerates tumor growth. We then prepared a human cancer-derived TLP mutant, D99H (31Cerami E. Gao J. Dogrusoz U. Gross B.E. Sumer S.O. Aksoy B.A. Jacobsen A. Byrne C.J. Heuer M.L. Larsson E. Antipin Y. Reva B. Goldberg A.P.

Integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles using the cBioPortal.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8695) Google Scholar). This mutant is found in cervical cancer that expresses wild-type p53, and the mutation is located in the p53 binding region (Fig. 6B) (27Maeda R. Suzuki H. Tanaka Y. Tamura T. Interaction between transactivation domain of p53 and middle part of TBP-like protein (TLP) is involved in TLP-stimulated and p53-activated transcription from the p21 upstream promoter.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e90190Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As expected, the p53 binding ability of D99H was considerably lower than that of wild-type TLP (Fig. 6C). Wild-type TLP-transfected HCT116 cells decreased cell growth in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). In contrast, overexpression of D99H did not influence cell growth (Fig. 6E). These results suggest that TLP-p53 binding is required for TLP-mediated cell growth repression. Recent studies have proposed that the concentration and duration of activated p53 and its target genes determine the cell fate decision such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence (33Leontieva O.V. Gudkov A.V. Blagosklonny M.V. Weak p53 permits senescence during cell cycle arrest.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4323-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Kracikova M. Akiri G. George A. Sachidanandam R. Aaronson S.A. A threshold mechanism mediates p53 cell fate decision between growth arrest and apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the present study we showed that TLP stabilizes the p53 protein, thereby enhancing its function. We demonstrated that the TLP function is evident in the late phase of a high dose of UV exposure and is important to mediate the induction of apoptosis and senescence. This indicates that TLP is required for persistent p53 activation and direction of the cell fate decision. We further showed that TLP disrupts the p53-MDM2 interaction and demonstrated that TLP prevented p53 degradation by interfering with MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and nuclear export of p53. Moreover, we found that the expression of TLP is increased at the protein level in the late phase of UV irradiation, suggesting that elevated TLP binds to p53 and releases p53 from the MDM2-mediated negative control. In contrast, the MDM2 function toward p53 becomes stronger when the levels of TLP in cells are low. Notably, MDM2 is one of the targets of p53 and thus is down-regulated by TLP knockdown. Although this result seems to cause p53 stabilization, TLP depletion decreased p53 levels. This situation is because the turnover of p53 became faster in TLP-depleted cells. These phenomena suggest that TLP maintains the protein levels of p53 and MDM2 in cells. Our findings indicate that TLP acts as an MDM2 blocker in the p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop and establishes a novel mechanism for long-lasting p53 activation to direct appropriate cell fate decision (Fig. 7). TBP recognizes the TATA element in promoters of many RNA polymerase II-driven genes, enabling it to constitute the basic transcriptional machinery on those promoters (35Hernandez N. TBP, a universal eukaryotic transcription factor?.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). TLP has been identified as a TBP family protein and is considered to be involved in various biological processes (21Zehavi Y. Kedmi A. Ideses D. Juven-Gershon T. TRF2: TRansForming the view of general transcription factors.Transcription. 2015; 6: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y.L. Duttke S.H. Chen K. Johnston J. Kassavetis G.A. Zeitlinger J. Kadonaga J.T. TRF2, but not TBP, mediates the transcription of ribosomal protein genes.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TLP binds to some general transcription factors, such as TFIIA, and interferes with the TBP-TFIIA interaction. The TLP-bound TFIIA precursor is protected from Taspase1-mediated cleavage, which leads to inhibition of TBP-mediated transcription (36Suzuki H. Isogai M. Maeda R. Ura K. Tamura T. TBP-like protein (TLP) interferes with Taspase1-mediated processing of TFIIA and represses TATA box gene expression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 6285-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Perhaps one role of TLP may be as a blocker of protein-protein interactions. We note that TLP depletion in HeLa cells increased p53 mRNA levels, although p53 protein levels were down-regulated in such a condition. This phenomenon seems to be governed by p53-independent TLP function, suggesting that TLP has multiple roles in both p53-dependent and -independent manners. The interplay between p53 and transcription-related factors in stress response is highly complicated. It is basically unknown whether basal transcription factors exert their positive or negative effects on p53 function. TFIIH, a multiprotein complex involved in both transcription and DNA repair, and TBP, both, activate p53-driven transcription (37Chen X. Farmer G. Zhu H. Prywes R. Prives C.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In contrast, TAF1 phosphorylates p53 at Thr-55 and mediates degradation of p53 (17Li H.H. Li A.G. Sheppard H.M. Liu X.

TAF1-mediated phosphorylation of p53 increases p53-MDM2 interaction and releases p53 from the p21 promoter in the late phase of UV irradiation. In this study we confirmed that p53 is actually recruited to the promoters of its target genes. However, TLP is not significantly recruited to promoters of representative p53 target genes. These results suggest that TLP affects p53 activity through a mechanism distinct from association of transcription machineries on a promoter. Hence, our findings may help to resolve the mechanisms underlying p53 dynamics and linking basal transcription factors to p53 activation. The nuclear export of p53 has also been widely discussed because a number of cancers show cytoplasmic localization of p53 (39Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2574656246,"The assembly of the replication fork helicase during S phase is key to the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. One step in this assembly in budding yeast is the association of Cdc45 with the Mcm2-7 heterohexameric ATPase, and a second step is the assembly of the tetrameric GINS ( G G- I chi- N ii- S an) complex with Mcm2-7. Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) and S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase (S-CDK) are two S phase-specific kinases that phosphorylate replication proteins during S phase, and Dpb11, Sld2, Sld3, Pol ϵ, and Mcm10 are factors that are also required for replication initiation. However, the exact roles of these initiation factors in assembly of the replication fork helicase remain unclear. We show here that Dpb11 stimulates DDK phosphorylation of the minichromosome maintenance complex protein Mcm4 alone and also of the Mcm2-7 complex and the dsDNA-loaded Mcm2-7 complex. We further demonstrate that Dpb11 can directly recruit DDK to Mcm4. A DDK phosphomimetic mutant of Mcm4 bound Dpb11 with substantially higher affinity than wild-type Mcm4, suggesting a mechanism to recruit Dpb11 to DDK-phosphorylated Mcm2-7. Furthermore, dsDNA-loaded Mcm2-7 harboring the DDK phosphomimetic Mcm4 mutant bound GINS in the presence of Dpb11, suggesting a mechanism for how GINS is recruited to Mcm2-7. We isolated a mutant of Dpb11 that is specifically defective for binding to Mcm4. This mutant, when expressed in budding yeast, diminished cell growth and DNA replication, substantially decreased Mcm4 phosphorylation, and decreased association of GINS with replication origins. We conclude that Dpb11 functions with DDK and Mcm4 in a positive amplification mechanism to trigger the assembly of the replication fork helicase."

Previously, we demonstrated that NKp65-mediated cellular cytotoxicity depends on tyrosine 7, located in a cytoplasmic sequence motif of NKp65 resembling a hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (hemITAM). HemITAMs have been reported for a few activating myeloid-specific CTLRs, including Dectin-1 and CLEC-2, and consist of a single tyrosine signaling unit preceded by a triacidic motif. Upon receptor engagement, the hemITAM undergoes phosphotyrosinylation and specifically recruits spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), initiating cellular activation. In this study, we addressed the functionality of the putative hemITAM of NKp65. We show that NKp65 forms homodimers and is phosphorylated at the hemITAM-embedded tyrosine 7 upon engagement by antibodies or KACL homodimers. HemITAM phosphotyrosinylation initiates a signaling pathway involving and depending on Syk, leading to cellular activation and natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. However, although NKp65 utilizes Syk for NK cell activation, a physical association of Syk with the NKp65 hemITAM could not be detected, unlike shown previously for the hemITAM of myeloid CTLR. Failure of NKp65 to recruit Syk is not due to an alteration of the triacidic motif, which rather affects the efficiency of hemITAM phosphotyrosinylation. In summary, NKp65 utilizes a hemITAM-like motif for cellular activation that requires Syk, although Syk appears not to be recruited to NKp65.

The immune system employs a plethora of cell types that orchestrate an immune response to pathogens and malignant cells threatening the integrity of an organism. Mammalian immune cells are categorized into cells of the adaptive branch, namely T and B lymphocytes, characterized by the generation of antigen-specific receptors through somatic gene rearrangement, and innate immune cells. The latter solely utilize germ line-encoded receptors to recognize “threats” to the organism.

Most activating immunoreceptors such as the T cell receptor (TCR) or natural cytotoxicity receptors associate with adaptor molecules such as CD3ζ or DAP12 bearing one or several immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) consisting of two tyrosine modules. Upon ligand engagement, these tyrosine residues become phosphorylated by members of the Src kinase family and recruit the Syk family members Syk and/or ZAP-70, which, in turn, activate signaling components such as SLP-76, PLCγ, and Vav proteins (18Vivier E.

Up on the tightrope: natural killer cell activation and inhibition.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). In the case of cytotoxic lymphocytes, these signaling proteins initiate a complex process composed of actin reorganization, direction of cytolytic vesicles containing perforin and granzymes to the cell surface, and targeted release of their cytolytic content at the target cell interface, resulting in cellular cytotoxicity (20Orange J.S.

Upon ligand binding, the hemITAM is phosphorylated and recruits Syk, initiating cellular activation. Phosphorylation of the hemITAM tyrosine is dependent on an upstream triacidic motif and the activity of Src kinases (23Hughes C.E. Sinha U. Pandey A. Eble J.A. O'Callaghan C.A. Watson S.P.

A more recent study suggested that CLEC-2 engagement activates Syk through a Src-PI3K-Tec pathway (26Manne B.K. Badolia R. Dangelmaier C. Eble J.A. Ellmeier W. Kahn M. Kunapuli S.P.

Attenuated natural killer (NK) cell activation through C-type lectin-like receptor NKp80 is due to an anomalous hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (HemITAM) with impaired Syk kinase recruitment capacity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17725-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Such Syk recruitment was accompanied by a more potent functional response in terms of cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. In contrast, other NKp80 mutants that showed increased hemITAM phosphorylation, but no Syk recruitment, did not exhibit a stronger functional response (28Rückrich T. Steinle A. Attenuated natural killer (NK) cell activation through C-type lectin-like receptor NKp80 is due to an anomalous hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (HemITAM) with impaired Syk kinase recruitment capacity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17725-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In our first report on NKp65, we showed that NKp65, in contrast to NKp80, potently triggers cellular cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion by NK-92MI cells (12Spreu J. Kuttruff S. Stejfova V. Dennehy K.M. Schittek B. Steinle A. Interaction of C-type lectin-like receptors NKp65 and KACL facilitates dedicated immune recognition of human keratinocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5100-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity triggered by NKp65 strictly depends on tyrosine 7, which, in contrast to NKp80, is embedded in a nearly perfect hemITAM consensus sequence. Hence, we expected NKp65 to initiate cellular activation by recruitment and activation of Syk in our ensuing studies addressing NKp65 signaling. We have shown previously that NKp65 activates cellular cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion by NK-92MI cells (12Spreu J. Kuttruff S. Stejfova V. Dennehy K.M. Schittek B. Steinle A. Interaction of C-type lectin-like receptors NKp65 and KACL facilitates dedicated immune recognition of human keratinocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5100-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using a redirected lysis assay and antibodies specific for carboxyl-terminal sequence tags added to NKp65, we have also shown that tyrosine 7 of NKp65 is required to trigger cytotoxicity (12Spreu J. Kuttruff S. Stejfova V. Dennehy K.M. Schittek B. Steinle A. Interaction of C-type lectin-like receptors NKp65 and KACL facilitates dedicated immune recognition of human keratinocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5100-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Well in line with these previous results, we now show, using the newly generated NKp65-specific mAb OMAR1, that antibody-mediated ligation of NKp65 triggers degranulation of NK-92MI cells, whereas ligation of an NKp65 mutant, where tyrosine 7 is replaced by phenylalanine (NKp65-Y7F), does not stimulate degranulation (Fig. 1A). Importantly, both NKp65 and NKp65-Y7F are expressed at comparable levels on the respective NK-92MI transductants (data not shown) and degranulate to a similar extent when generically activated with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 1A). Similarly, antibody-mediated cross-linking of NKp65, but not of NKp65-Y7F, stimulated calcium influx into NK-92MI transductants (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that tyrosine 7 is strictly required for NKp65-mediated cellular activation. Tyrosine 7 is embedded in an amino-terminal cytoplasmic sequence motif of NKp65 that resembles a hemITAM described previously for some myeloid C-type lectin-like receptors such as Dectin-1, CLEC-2, and DNGR-1 (Fig. 1C) (21Fuller G.L.

The C-type lectin receptors CLEC-2 and Dectin-1, but not DC-SIGN, signal via a novel YXXL-dependent signaling cascade.J. Biol.

Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptors that mediate cellular activation via single tyrosine based activation motifs.Immunol. Rev. 2010; 234: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because hemITAM-mediated signaling is initiated by phosphorylation of the hemITAM-embedded tyrosine, we next addressed whether tyrosine 7 of NKp65 becomes phosphorylated upon NKp65 ligation. Treatment of NK-92MI-NKp65 cells with the broad protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate resulted in substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of NKp65 (Fig. 1D). To assess whether tyrosine phosphorylation of NKp65 is also specifically induced upon NKp65 ligation, NKp65 on NK-92MI-NKp65 cells was cross-linked with mAb OMAR1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of NKp65 became clearly detectable ∼30 s after cross-linking and subsequently increased further (Fig. 1E). In contrast, NKp65-Y7F was not phosphotyrosinylated upon cross-linking, well in line with the importance of tyrosine 7 phosphorylation for the functionality of the NKp65 hemITAM (Fig. 1E). Altogether, these data demonstrate that cellular activation by NKp65 occurs in a hemITAM-dependent manner. Typically, hemITAM-mediated signaling by myeloid CTLR includes the recruitment of Syk to the phosphorylated hemITAM (22Sancho D. Reis e Sousa Signaling by myeloid C-type lectin receptors in immunity and homeostasis.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 491-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Because NKp65 shares the hemITAM consensus with these myeloid CTLRs (Fig. 1C) and potently activates effector functions of NK-92MI cells in a hemITAM-dependent manner, we expected NKp65 to recruit Syk upon activation. To address an involvement of Syk in NKp65-mediated cellular activation, we monitored the degranulation of NK-92MI-NKp65 cells in the presence of a Syk inhibitor. Degranulation of NK-92MI-NKp65 cells upon NKp65 cross-linking by OMAR1 was inhibited by addition of Syk inhibitor IV in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In accord with this finding, antibody-mediated cross-linking of NKp65 led to a marked phosphorylation of Syk in NK-92MI cells (Fig. 2B). However, no Syk phosphorylation was observed when NKp65-Y7F was cross-linked, demonstrating that NKp65-induced phosphorylation of Syk depends on the presence of the hemITAM-embedded tyrosine 7. Next we addressed Syk recruitment by the phosphorylated hemITAM of NKp65. To this aim, NK-92MI-NKp65 cells were treated with pervanadate to stimulate phosphorylation of tyrosine 7, followed by NKp65 immunoprecipitation and Syk immunoblotting. For comparison, NKp80 from pervanadate-treated NK-92MI-NKp80 or NK-92MI-NKp80-DG cells was immunoprecipitated. We have reported previously that the hemITAM of NKp80 does not recruit Syk because of the presence of two non-consensus amino acids (glutamic acid 5 and arginine 6) directly preceding tyrosine 7 (28Rückrich T. Steinle A. Attenuated natural killer (NK) cell activation through C-type lectin-like receptor NKp80 is due to an anomalous hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (HemITAM) with impaired Syk kinase recruitment capacity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17725-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Accordingly, an NKp80 mutant with a reconstitution of the hemITAM consensus (NKp80-DG) regained the capacity to recruit Syk (28Rückrich T. Steinle A. Attenuated natural killer (NK) cell activation through C-type lectin-like receptor NKp80 is due to an anomalous hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (HemITAM) with impaired Syk kinase recruitment capacity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17725-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Well in line with our previous results, Syk was detectable in precipitates of NKp80-DG (Fig. 2C). However, Syk was not detectable in precipitates of both phosphotyrosinylated NKp65 and NKp80, strongly suggesting that NKp65, much like NKp80, does not recruit Syk (Fig. 2C). Syk recruitment to other hemITAM receptors such as CLEC-2 was assessed by GST pulldown experiments by using the tandem SH2 domain of Syk fused to GST (21Fuller G.L. Williams J.A. Tomlinson M.G. Eble J.A. Hanna S.L. Pöhlmann S. Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Pearce A.C. The C-type lectin receptors CLEC-2 and Dectin-1, but not DC-SIGN, signal via a novel YXXL-dependent signaling cascade.J. Biol.

Therefore, we re-enacted the GST pulldown by immobilizing purified GST-Syk-SH2 fusion protein on glutathione-agarose and incubation with NKp65, NKp65-Y7F, NKp80-DG, and NKp80 enriched from pervanadate-treated NK-92MI cells by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2D). GST-Syk-SH2 only pulled down NKp80-DG but not NKp65, NKp65-Y7F, or NKp80, thereby confirming the results above from immunoprecipitations and revealing a critical difference of both NKp65 and NKp80 from CLEC-2, which was successfully pulled down by this strategy (21Fuller G.L. Williams J.A. Tomlinson M.G. Eble J.A. Hanna S.L. Pöhlmann S. Suzuki-Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Watson S.P. Pearce A.C. The C-type lectin receptors CLEC-2 and Dectin-1, but not DC-SIGN, signal via a novel YXXL-dependent signaling cascade.J. Biol.

Hence, triggering of cytotoxicity via NKp65 involves and depends on Syk activation, which, in turn, depends on a functional NKp65 hemITAM. However, in contrast to hemITAM-bearing myeloid CTLR, NKp65 apparently does not recruit Syk via its hemITAM. The observed failure of NKp65 to recruit Syk was unexpected, as the NKp65 hemITAM conforms to the hemITAM consensus (Fig. 1C). Just the exchange of aspartic acid for asparagine at position 3 slightly deviates from the hemITAM consensus, altering the triacidic motif (Fig. 1C) (23Hughes C.E. Sinha U. Pandey A. Eble J.A. O'Callaghan C.A. Watson S.P. Critical role for an acidic amino acid region in platelet signaling by the HemITAM (hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) containing receptor CLEC-2 (C-type lectin receptor-2).J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 5127-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This specific deviation from an otherwise matched hemITAM consensus also occurs in the NKp65 sequences of many other mammalian species, indicating an evolutionary conserved function (Fig. 3A). Hence, we figured that asparagine 3, in the absence of any other obvious mismatch, may account for the impaired Syk recruitment. To test this presumption, we reconstituted the triacidic motif by replacing asparagine 3 with aspartic acid (NKp65-N3D). NKp65-N3D was expressed on NK-92MI transductants at levels comparable with NKp65 and NKp65-Y7F, respectively (data not shown). Subsequent to antibody-mediated cross-linking, NKp65-N3D was immunoprecipitated from NK-92MI-NKp65-N3D cells and assayed for phosphorylation and Syk recruitment. Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected for NKp65-N3D as well as for NKp65 but not for NKp65-Y7F, confirming previous results. Interestingly, phosphorylation of NKp65-N3D was substantially enhanced compared with NKp65 (Fig. 3B). However, Syk remained undetectable in NKp65-N3D precipitates, rejecting the notion that impaired Syk recruitment may be due to the alteration of the triacidic motif (Fig. 3, B and C). To address the possibility that NKp65 endogenously expressed in NK-92MI cells (12Spreu J. Kuttruff S. Stejfova V. Dennehy K.M. Schittek B. Steinle A.

Subsequent to antibody-mediated cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of the transduced receptors, precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3D). Both NKp65 and NKp65-N3D, but not"

Most black holes are thought to start out as collapsed stars, but they grow too slowly to fit the bill. Instead, theorists have suggested, the behemoth black holes in the early universe could have gotten a head start when huge gas clouds left by the big bang quickly shrank under their own gravity and condensed into black hole seeds 10 thousand to 100 thousand times heavier than the sun. Those seeds would have grown further by sucking in stars and gas.

Although this comet-like behavior could feed the meteor stream, the mass of material ejected is far too small.
