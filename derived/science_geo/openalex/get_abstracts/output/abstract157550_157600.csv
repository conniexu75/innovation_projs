Here we use genetically engineered nisin variants to identify the structural requirements for the interaction of the peptide with lipid II. Mutations affecting the conformation of the N-terminal part of nisin comprising rings A through C, e.g.[S3T]nisin, led to reduced binding and increased the peptide concentration necessary for pore formation. The binding constant for the S3T mutant was 0.043 × 107m−1 compared with 2 × 107m−1 for the wild-type peptide, and the minimum concentration for pore formation increased from the 1 nm to the 50 nm range. In contrast, peptides mutated in the flexible hinge region, e.g. [ΔN20/ΔM21]nisin, were completely inactive in the pore formation assay, but were reduced to some extent in their in vivo activity. We found the remaining in vivo activity to result from the unaltered capacity of the mutated peptide to bind to lipid II and thus to inhibit its incorporation into the peptidoglycan network. Therefore, through interaction with the membrane-bound cell wall precursor lipid II, nisin inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis and forms highly specific pores. The combination of two killing mechanisms in one molecule potentiates antibiotic activity and results in nanomolar MIC values, a strategy that may well be worth considering for the construction of novel antibiotics.

It belongs to the lantibiotics, a group of antimicrobial peptides that is characterized by the presence of intramolecular rings formed by the thioether amino acids lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine (3Gross E. Morell J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 4634-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 4Sahl H.-G. Bierbaum G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Nisin has had a long history as a potent and safe food preservative, although recent insight into the molecular mechanism of its bactericidal activity also make it interesting for biomedical applications (5Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H.-G. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 6Brötz H. Sahl H.-G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Generally, the nisin-type subgroup of lantibiotics comprises elongated cationic peptides that have the capacity to adopt amphiphilic structures. Such peptides are assumed to kill microbes by disturbing the integrity of the energy-transducing membrane. Indeed, early experiments demonstrated that nisin or related lantibiotics induced rapid efflux of ions or cytoplasmic solutes such as amino acids and nucleotides. The concomitant depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane resulted in an instant termination of all biosynthetic processes (7Ruhr E. Sahl H.-G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 8Sahl H.-G. Kordel M. Benz R. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Structural analysis in the presence of micelles indicated that the hydrophilic groups of the peptide interact with the phospholipid headgroups, and the hydrophobic side chains are immersed in the hydrophobic core of the membrane (9van den Hooven H.W. Doeland C.C.M. van de Kamp M. Konings R.N.H. Hilbers C.W. van de Ven F.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 293-382Google Scholar, 10van den Hooven H.W. Spronk C.A.E.M. van de Kamp M. Konings R.N.H. Hilbers C.W. van de Ven F.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The wedge model as proposed by Driessen et al. (11Driessen A.J.M. van den Hooven H.W. Kuiper W. van de Kamp M. Sahl H.-G. Konings R.N.H. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) takes into account such structural data and proposes that the peptides insert into the membrane without losing contact with the membrane surface, resulting in the formation of a short-lived pore. Whereas the wedge model may illustrate results obtained with model membranes, a number of effects observed with intact living cells remain unexplained; in particular, the fact that nisin acts on model membranes at micromolar concentrations whereas in vivo minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)1 values are in the nanomolar range. The discrepancies were explained by the finding that nisin and epidermin use lipid II, the bactoprenol-bound precursor of the bacterial cell wall as a docking molecule for subsequent pore formation (12Brötz H. Josten M. Wiedemann I. Schneider U. Götz F. Bierbaum G. Sahl H.-G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The specificity of the nisin-lipid II interaction and the resulting high level activity of nisin was demonstrated in a comparative study with the pore-forming amphiphilic defense peptide magainin 2 (5Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H.-G. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). We found that, in contrast to magainin, the activity of nisin is enhanced by a factor of 103 when lipid II is available for targeted pore formation. The fact that nisin specifically binds to lipid II was particularly remarkable, because previously mersacidin and actagardine from the type B class of lantibiotics also had been shown to form a complex with the cell wall precursor. In this case however, binding only blocked the precursor from incorporation into polymeric peptidoglycan (13Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Leopold K. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.-G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that lantibiotics may have defined lipid II binding motifs that could represent interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antibiotics. In particular, these lantibiotics are active against the Gram-positive bacteria that are most prominent with regard to resistance development, e.g. Staphylococci and Enterococci. Here we studied the interaction between lipid II and a number of nisin mutant peptides to identify the structural elements of the nisin molecule that are important for the interaction with lipid II and subsequent pore formation. Surprisingly, we identified nisin mutant peptides that were unable to form pores but retained considerable antimicrobial activity through blocking lipid II from incorporation into peptidoglycan. Thus nisin is a dual-function antibiotic with two killing mechanisms combined into one molecule. All chemicals were of analytical grade or better. The phospholipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. and stored at −20 °C in a 9:1 chloroform/methanol solution. Carboxyfluorescein (CF) was purchased from Kodak and purified as described previously (15Ralston E. Hjelmeland L.M. Klausner R.D. Weinstein J.N. Blumenthal R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 133-137Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchonic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Corp.) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nisin Z (16Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as well as all mutant peptides (18van Kraaij C. Breukink E. Rollema H.S. Siezen R.J. Demel R.A. de Kruijff B. Kuipers O.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were produced in SPYS medium (3% sucrose, 1% peptone (Difco), 1% yeast extract (Difco), 0.2% NaCl, 0.002% MgSO4, and 1% KH2PO4, pH 6.8). Peptides were purified from supernatants by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography using Fractogel TSK butyl 650-M (Tosohaas), followed by preparative reversed phase-HPLC using acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as eluents. Mutations were verified by mass spectroscopy. Nisin Z is a natural variant of nisin A that only differs in one single residue (Asn instead of His at position 27) and possesses almost identical antimicrobial properties (19Kuipers O.P. Yap W.M.G.J. Rollema H.S. Beerthuyzen M.M. Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Jung G. Sahl H.-G. Nisin and Novel Lantibiotics. Escom, Leiden1991: 250-259Google Scholar, 20de Vos W.M. Mulders J.W.M. Siezen R.J.

Bierbaum G. Ottenwälder B. Dodd H.M. Horn N. Metzger J.W. Kupke T. Gnau V. Bongers R. van den Bogaard P. Kosters H. Rollema H.S. de Vos W.M. Siezen R.J. Jung G. Götz F. Sahl H.-G. Gasson M.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 69: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the charged mutants [V32E]nisin Z and [V32K]nisin were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations of the structural genes nisA or nisZwere performed by two successive polymerase chain reactions, and mutated genes were expressed in L. lactis NZ9800 as described previously (18van Kraaij C. Breukink E. Rollema H.S. Siezen R.J. Demel R.A. de Kruijff B. Kuipers O.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nisin stock solutions were stored at −80 °C in 0.05% acetic acid. The MIC was determined by the inhibition of growth of the indicator strains Micrococcus flavus DSM 1790 and Streptococcus thermophilus Rs in a liquid bioassay (16Kuipers O.P. Rollema H.S.

Demel R.A. de Kruijff B. Kuipers O.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Lipid II was synthesized in vitro using membrane preparations of Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698. Membranes were isolated from lysozyme-treated cells by centrifugation (40,000 × g), washed twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5 and stored under liquid nitrogen. For extraction and purification, the protocol elaborated by Brötz et al. (14Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Leopold K. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.-G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for [14C]lipid II was applied. The unlabeled lipid II generated for the present study was detected by exploiting its ability to form a complex with mersacidin. Aliquots of the respective chromatographic fractions were added to a mersacidin activity test (12Brötz H. Josten M. Wiedemann I. Schneider U. Götz F. Bierbaum G. Sahl H.-G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and those fractions that were able to antagonize mersacidin activity were collected. The lipid II concentration in stock solutions was determined by quantitative analysis of amino acids and amino sugars using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatization technique (22Sahl H.-G. Grossgarten M. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Brandis H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lipid II samples were hydrolyzed in sealed tubes with 6n HCl at 110 °C for 18 h. After evaporation of HCl, amino acids and sugars were taken up in 200 mm borate buffer, pH 9.5 and derivatized with OPA. The derivatives were separated by reversed-phase C18 HPLC chromatography using 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (buffer A) and methanol/tetrahydrofuran (97:3) as eluent B. Fluorescence of the derivatives was recorded at 450 nm (excitation at 340 nm) and quantitated using appropriate standards. Purified lipid II was stored in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) at −20 °C. Large unilamellar vesicles for the binding, CF efflux, and potassium efflux experiments were prepared by the extrusion technique (23Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar) and treated as described previously (24Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Vesicles were made of DOPC with or without 0.065 mol % lipid II (referring to the total amount of lipids). Phospholipid was determined as inorganic phosphate after treatment with perchloric acid (25Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 496Crossref Scopus (2865) Google Scholar). CF-loaded vesicles were prepared with 50 mm CF and then diluted in 1.25 ml of K+ buffer (50 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.0, 100 mm K2SO4) in a final concentration of 25 μm phospholipid (on a phosphorous base). After addition of wild-type or mutant nisin, the induced leakage was monitored for 3 min. The increase of fluorescence intensity was measured at 515 nm (excitation at 492 nm) on a SPF 500C spectrophotometer (SLM instruments Inc.) at 20 °C. The nisin-induced CF leakage was expressed relative to the total amount of CF released after lysis of the vesicles by addition of 10 μl of 20% Triton X-100. Potassium-loaded vesicles were prepared with KCl buffer (150 mm KCl, 30 mm Mes, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.5). The vesicles were added to 5 ml of buffer (30 mm Mes, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 150 mm choline chloride) in a final concentration of 25 μm phospholipid. Nisin or nisin mutant-induced leakage was monitored with a K+selective electrode (15-K, Philips) and a reference electrode (R44/2, Philips). The total amount of K+ in the vesicles was determined after addition of 20 μl of a 20% solution ofN,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (Fluka). Leakage was expressed relative to the total amount of K+. The electrodes were calibrated by titrating known amounts of potassium. Radioactive labeling of nisin and binding experiments were performed as described previously by Breukink (24Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nisin Z, [S3T]nisin Z and [ΔN20/ΔM21]nisin A were14C-labeled by reductive methylation of the ε-amino group of the lysine residues according to the method of Dottavio-Martin and Ravel (26Dottavio-Martin D. Ravel J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The resulting preparations had specific activities of 4.6 × 104, 8.2 × 104, and 13.3 × 104 dpm/nmol, respectively. The radiolabeled peptides were stored in 0.05% (v/v) acetic acid at −80 °C. The binding of the [14C]nisin Z and variants was determined under equilibrium conditions. Vesicles (160 μm, on a phosphorus base) made of DOPC with 4% DOPG or with 0.5 mol % lipid II were incubated at room temperature with 14C-labeled peptide in 0.5 ml of buffer (25 mm Mes, pH 6.0, 50 mmK2SO4) for 5 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 430,000 × g for 45 min to spin down the vesicles with the bound nisin Z. The amount of unbound nisin in the supernatant and of vesicle-bound nisin in the pellet was determined by scintillation counting. No phosphate could be detected in the supernatant after the centrifugation steps, and 90–100% of the applied radioactivity was recovered. The binding isotherms of the nisin-lipid II interaction could be well described by the Langmuir adsorption model assuming that lipid II was the only binding site for nisin in the context of DOPC vesicles. A crude membrane fraction was prepared from Escherichia coli TB1 by disruption of exponentially growing cells with a Branson Sonifier 250 (Danburry CT) twice for 3–5 min, 50% cooling phase and power level 5. Membranes were collected by centrifugation (40,000 × g), then washed and resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5), to give a protein concentration of 8 mg/ml. UDP-N-acetylmuramylpentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) was isolated from Staphylococcus simulans 22. To accumulate the murein precursor, exponentially growing cells were supplemented with 5 μg/ml vancomycin and incubated for 30 min. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in distilled water (0.1 g/ml) and extracted by stirring the suspension slowly into 2.5 volumes of boiling water. After 15 min, the suspension was cooled, the cell debris removed (48,000 × g) and the supernatant lyophilized. The lyophilized material was then dissolved in water and brought to pH 2 with 20% H3PO4. After acidification, precipitated material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fractionated on reversed-phase C18 HPLC under isocratic conditions (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 5.2). The UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was identified by mass spectrometry. For cell wall biosynthesis assays (35Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Markus A. Molitor E. Sahl H.-G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it was applied in 0.2 mm concentrations together with membranes (160 μg of protein), 0.05 mm[14C]UDP-GlcNAc and 15–60 μm nisin peptides in a total volume of 60 μl of membrane suspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm mercaptoethanol). Incubation proceeded for 45 min at 32 °C before the reaction was stopped by heating (100 °C, 30 s). Aliquots were analyzed by paper chromatography (paper GB 002, Schleicher und Schüll, Dassel, Germany) in isobutyric acid/1m NH4OH (5:3, v/v). Polymeric peptidoglycan does not migrate from the starting point, and the respective area was cut out and counted in a β-scintillation counter (1900 CA Tri-Carb scintillation counter, Packard, Zürich). Previous studies had shown that nisin in low concentrations can induce rapid efflux of CF from multilamellar liposomes when supplemented with 0.1 mol % lipid II. In the absence of lipid II, such liposomes were not affected by nisin concentrations as high as 1.25 μm (12Brötz H. Josten M. Wiedemann I. Schneider U. Götz F. Bierbaum G. Sahl H.-G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To characterize in detail the lipid II effect, we used unilamellar vesicles doped with 0.065 mol % of the cell wall precursor. At 5 nm nisin, significant dye release was observed, and ∼60% release was achieved with 50 nmnisin (Fig. 1 A). Because dye efflux reached a plateau within less than a minute, we plotted the percentage of dye released after 1 min for a closer inspection of the concentration dependence of the nisin pore formation. Fig.1 B demonstrates that upon the incorporation of lipid II, the sensitivity of DOPC (1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) liposomes increased by three orders of magnitude. CF release started at about 1 nmof the lantibiotic, whereas more than 1 μm nisin was necessary to affect DOPC liposomes without lipid II. In accordance with previous studies in the absence of lipid II (24Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), membranes containing the negatively charged lipids DOPG were considerably more sensitive (Fig. 1 B) than the DOPC liposomes. However, the difference in sensitivity disappeared after incorporation of 0.065 mol % lipid II (Fig. 1 C). Although the overall activity of nisin toward lipid II-containing liposomes was relatively independent from the phospholipid composition, slightly higher release rates were obtained with DOPC as the bulk phase constituent. Under the test conditions applied, the maximum marker release was achieved with nisin concentrations in the range of 0.05 to 0.1 μm (Fig.1 C). Application of higher concentrations reduced the dye release efficiency with the DOPC liposomes and with the DOPC/DOPG mixture. With DOPG vesicles, the dye-release rate increased again at 1 μm, which agrees well with the results depicted in Fig.1 B, because it coincides with the onset of the marker release activity in the absence of lipid II. Similar to the dependence of pore formation on peptide concentration, dye release was also dependent on the lipid II concentration in liposomes (Fig. 1 D). In a lipid II titration series in which the nisin concentration was kept constant at 10 nm or 100 nm, efflux started at 0.001 mol % lipid II,i.e. for an average liposome of 400 nm in diameter and 7 × 105 bulk lipid molecules (of 0.70 nm2), only seven lipid II molecules per vesicle were sufficient to promote dye release. With increasing peptide concentrations, the release activity reached an optimum, in this case at ∼0.1 mol %, and decreased with greater lipid II concentrations. The presence of an optimum in the curves obtained in both titration series suggests that there is an optimal lipid II to peptide ratio, which may be in the range of 1:1, e.g. at 0.1 mol % lipid II (optimum in Fig. 1 D) the ratio is 1.0:0.4 (lipid II to nisin) for 10 nm nisin, or 1:4 for 100 nmnisin, respectively. We also replaced the negatively charged CF with K+ to detect indications for ion selectivity of the pore. Interestingly, the efflux rates did not significantly differ with both markers (e.g. Fig. 2; 90% K+ release after 1 min with 100 nm nisin). The absence of ion selectivity of nisin pores formed in lipid II-doped membranes stands in contrast to data obtained without lipid II (24Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and suggests that lipid II not only enhances the pore formation activity of nisin but also has an influence on the pore architecture. Membrane poration by cationic amphiphilic peptides is considered a sequential process that includes binding to the target membrane, insertion into the membrane, and the formation of a functional pore. Detailed studies with various model peptides (27Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Miyama K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12553-12559Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and with nisin Z (24Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) demonstrate that lipids with a net negative charge, such as DOPG, are important for binding via electrostatic interactions (24Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6968-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nisin, for example, was bound stoichiometrically to one DOPG molecule per positively charged amino acid residue. In contrast, very little nisin was bound by pure DOPC liposomes, and the above data (Fig.1 C) illustrate that DOPG is not essential when lipid II serves as a specific target. We therefore studied the binding behavior of radiolabeled nisin to DOPC liposomes supplemented with lipid II. With lipid II present in 0.5 mol %, nisin showed a binding behavior that was best described by the Langmuir adsorption model with an apparent minimal binding constant of 2 × 107m−1 (Fig.3). The data shown in Fig. 3 indicate that nisin binding saturates when each lipid II molecule is loaded with one nisin Z molecule, indicative of a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, which agrees well with the optimum curves obtained in the peptide and lipid II titration experiments (Fig.1 D). A 1:1 stoichiometry requires that all lipid II is available for binding; however, the procedure for preparation of lipid II-containing liposomes is very likely to result in a symmetric distribution of lipid II headgroups with regard to the bilayer;i.e. only 50% of the incorporated lipid II molecules should be outwardly orientated. However, recent experiments with C-terminal His-tagged nisin Z convincingly demonstrate that the lantibiotic is able to translocate across a negatively charged lipid-containing membrane (28van Kraaij C. Breukink E. Noordermeer M.A. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16033-16040Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In light of these results it seems likely that in the presence of lipid II, nisin can translocate across the membrane and thus the inwardly orientated lipid II becomes available for interaction with nisin. We used the DOPC/0.065 mol % lipid II vesicle system to identify the structural elements in the nisin molecule that are important for the interaction with lipid II and/or subsequent pore formation. Structure-function studies with nisin and other lantibiotics had identified various structural features important for the bactericidal activity in vivo or for activities in in vitro systems. For instance, the C-terminal part of nisin is important for binding to membranes with a negative surface charge (24Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. Kuipers O.P. de Kruijff B.

https://openalex.org/W1544008935,"To examine how functional circuits are established in the brain, we studied excitatory transmission in early postnatal hippocampus. Spontaneous neural activity was sufficient to selectively deliver GluR4-containing AMPA receptors (AMPA-Rs) into synapses. This delivery allowed non-functional connections to transmit at resting potentials and required NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) but not CaMKII activation. Subsequently, these delivered receptors were exchanged with non-synaptic GluR2-containing AMPA-Rs in a manner requiring little neuronal activity. The enhanced transmission resulting from this delivery and subsequent exchange was maintained for at least several days and required an interaction between GluR2 and NSF. Thus, this sequence of subunit-specific trafficking events triggered by spontaneous activity in early postnatal development may be crucial for initial establishment of long-lasting functional circuitry."

Paclitaxel is isolated from the bark of the pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) and functions by binding and stabilizing microtubules (3Schiff P.B. Horwitz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Binding of paclitaxel to microtubules blocks normal cell cycle progression during the merger of mitotic metaphase and anaphase. This prevents chromosome segregation, leading to tumor cell death. Combination therapy of paclitaxel and Herceptin, an anti-Her2-neu antibody, has produced impressive responses among breast cancer patients (4Baselga J. Norton L. Albanell J. Kim Y.M. Mendelsohn J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2825-2831PubMed Google Scholar), although this combination is obviously limited to Her2-neu+ tumors. Combination therapy with other drugs, preferably via a rational molecular basis that is widely applicable to many tumor types, is essential for improved cancer treatment. A combination of paclitaxel with reagents that activate additional apoptotic signals, or inhibit survival signals, may provide a rational molecular basis for novel chemotherapeutic strategies. A rational molecular target is the ERK1 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway that may serve as an opposing force to Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK/SAPK). Previous reports have shown that JNK/SAPK leads to cell death, while MEK activation contributes to cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (5Gupta K. Kshirsagar S. Li W. Gui L.

Activated Raf-1, a serine-threonine kinase, initiates the signaling cascade through MEK, which in turn phosphorylates a second serine-threonine kinase ERK. ERK phosphorylates additional kinases and specific transcription factors, such as Elk-1 and c-Fos, which are important in cell proliferation. However, the link between Raf-1 and ERK activation and paclitaxel-induced cell death is not straightforward. Several studies have shown that at a low concentration of the drug, paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis is attributed to activated Raf-1 (7Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. El-Diery W.S. Kingston D.G.I.

In this report, we tested the combined effects of paclitaxel and inhibitors of MEK1/2 kinase on tumor cell apoptosis. The specificity of MEK1/2 inhibition was achieved by using two different MEK inhibitors, and by the additional use of transdominant-negative mutants, which inhibit MEK/ERK activation. The reasons for selecting MEK1/2 as the target are: (i) MEK is activated in many tumors (15Sivaraman V.S. Wang H. Nuovo G.J. Malbon C.C. J. Clin.

The combined treatment of paclitaxel plus MEK1/2 inhibition leads to enhanced cell death in breast, ovarian, and lung tumor lines. Following 2 h of paclitaxel (Sigma) treatment, cells were washed, harvested with lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 4 °C (10Lee L.F. Li G. Templeton D.J. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation (2,500 rpm) at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated JNK was mixed with 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated with SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. H157 human lung carcinoma cells were serum-starved for 16 h and treated simultaneously with the indicated concentrations of paclitaxel with or without 10 μm U0126 (Promega). After 15 min of treatment, cells were lysed in 1× PBS, 1% Trition X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin at 4 °C. Cell lysates were separated with SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ERK monoclonal antibody for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Manufacturer's instructions were followed for the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cells were plated at 5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h. The cells were treated for 20–24 h with the indicated doses of paclitaxel and U0126. Following lysis, the samples were centrifuged and 20 μl of the supernatant transferred to a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate as described (10Lee L.F. Li G. Templeton D.J. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Anti-histone biotin and anti-DNA peroxidase antibodies were added to each well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After three washes with incubation buffer, the peroxidase substrate was added to each well. Following a 15-min incubation, the plates were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader. The data in this report are expressed as -fold increase in optical density as compared with control treated cells. Adherent and detached cells were collected with trypsin and centrifuged at 200 × g. Cells were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in PBS and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Fixed cells were centrifuged at 200 × g, and each sample resuspended in propidium iodide (PI) stain buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μg of DNase-free RNase A, 20 μg of PI) in PBS for 30 min. After staining, samples were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) and ModFit LT (Verity Software). Cells were split at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in a four-well chamber slide (Lab-Tek). Following a 36-h incubation, the cells were treated with 10 nm paclitaxel in the presence or absence of 10 μm U0126 for 20 h. Following treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were washed twice more with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After two more washes, each slide was covered with equilibration buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 more min. The buffer was then aspirated, and the slides were incubated with TdT buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped with 2× SSC, and the slides were viewed with an immunofluorescence microscope. The effect of paclitaxel on JNK and ERK activities is shown in Fig. 1. Basal JNK activity was detected, and this activity was significantly enhanced by treatment with low, nanomolar doses of paclitaxel in human lung and breast carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 1 A). A basal level of ERK was also detected, and low doses of paclitaxel activated endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 1 B). The MEK inhibitor, U0126, completely blocked ERK activation by paclitaxel. The activation of JNK in this scenario has been previously found to contribute to apoptosis, while the role of paclitaxel-induced ERK has not been studied. In other systems, ERK generally plays a critical role in cell proliferation and growth (22Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar); thus, it was reasoned that ERK activation by paclitaxel might enhance cell proliferation and compromise the efficacy of this drug. A logical approach is to use pharmacologic blockers of MEK to inhibit paclitaxel-induced ERK activation and its downstream effects. To test this hypothesis, a combination of paclitaxel and a potent MEK1 inhibitor, U0126, was used to treat a variety of human carcinoma lines, and cell death was measured by the cell death detection ELISA that detects DNA-histone fragmentation. The combination of paclitaxel plus U0126 enhanced cell death (Fig. 2 A). The -fold increase in apoptosis was calculated by comparing the ELISA optical density readings of treated samples, with the value of the untreated control as 1.0. In H157 cells, paclitaxel and U0126 combined caused four times more cell death than paclitaxel alone, and eight times more cell death than U0126 alone. A similar trend was observed in OVCA194 cells. The potential use of low dose chemotherapy is important, because lower dosages are more attainable during cancer therapy and likely to cause less toxicity in patients. We performed a dose-response analysis to assess the minimal concentration of paclitaxel, which when combined with U0126, causes enhanced cell death. Low doses of paclitaxel, starting at the 10 nm range, combined with U0126 cause enhanced cell death in both BT474 breast and H157 lung carcinoma cells (Fig. 2 B). To control for pharmacologic specificity, two additional experiments were performed. First, a second MEK inhibitor PD98059 was used and produced similar data (Fig. 2 C), providing additional evidence that the MEK enzyme is the target. However, pharmacologic approaches have their limitations, because the specificity of the drug can always be questioned. To provide further evidence for the effects of MEK inhibition, a dominant-negative MEK (dnMEK) mutant was introduced into H157 cells. Expression of dnMEK in the presence of low dose (50 and 250 nm) paclitaxel enhanced apoptosis over the pCMV empty vector control (Fig. 2 D). Table I summarizes enhanced apoptosis observed with paclitaxel and U0126. In H157 and OVCA194 cells, the combination treatment produced 4.0- and 2.5-fold enhancement of apoptosis over the expected additive effect. This enhancement was achieved with relative low dosages (1 μm paclitaxel, 10 μm U0126) of these two drugs. This trend was also observed with the breast carcinoma BT474 (not shown).Table ICombination treatment with paclitaxel and MEK inhibitor U012610 μm U01261 μmpaclitaxelCombination treatmentFold increase over additive 1-b(Observed combination)/(expected combination).Expected 1-a(Mean cell death of U0126) + (mean cell death of paclitaxel).ObservedH1573.013.016.063.74.0OVCA1943.18.711.830.12.5H157 and OVCA194 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of U0126 and paclitaxel for 24 h.

Open table in a new tab H157 and OVCA194 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of U0126 and paclitaxel for 24 h. Apoptosis was analyzed by cell death ELISA that measures DNA-histone release, and data are expressed as absorbance [A405 nm −A490 nm] × 100. To examine the mechanism of U0126 and paclitaxel induced cell death, their effects on cell cycle progression was studied. The BT474 breast carcinoma cells were treated with paclitaxel and/or U0126, and cell cycle progression was analyzed by incubating the cells with propidium iodide, which allowed the analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry. U0126 arrested BT474 cells in G1, while 10 nmpaclitaxel produced a dramatic G2 block (Fig. 3A). The percentage of control treated cells in G2-M was 13%, which increased to 75% after treatment with 10 nm paclitaxel for 24 h. Seventeen percentage of the cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of paclitaxel, while a negligible increase in cell death was detected in the presence of U0126 when compared with the control (6% compared with 4%). In contrast, the combination of paclitaxel and U0126 substantially increased cell death as evidence by accumulation of a sub-G1 population that has <2 n DNA (Fig. 3 A) and represents dead cells. These results further support the ELISA result that low doses of paclitaxel and U0126 enhanced tumor cell death. To assess if the cell death observed above represents apoptosis, a TUNEL assay was performed with paclitaxel, U0126, or a combination of the two drugs. Singly, paclitaxel and U0126 caused little apoptosis (0.6 and 0.4%, see panels i–vi, Fig. 3 B) as measured by the number of TUNEL-positive cells. When cells were treated with both, there was a dramatic increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells to 11.1% (panels vii andviii, Fig. 3 B). Phase-contrast photomicrographs of H157 cells revealed changes in morphology and cell membrane blebbing, which are characteristics of apoptosis (panel ix, Fig. 3 B). These results further indicate that paclitaxel and U0126 enhance apoptosis. In the last 2 years, we and others have reported that paclitaxel affects MAP kinases. The best documented is the activation of JNK/SAPK by paclitaxel, which has been found in a variety of tumor cell lines (10Lee L.F. Li G. Templeton D.J. Ting J.P. J. Biol.

JNK/SAPK activation is primarily a stress response, long proposed to be a determining factor in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (23Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Studies of hippocampal neuronal cells show that these cells do not undergo apoptosis when a JNK subgroup (jnk1, jnk2, or jnk3) is mutated. Very recently, the use of mice lacking functional JNK provides strong evidence that JNK is important in causing apoptosis (24Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D.

Additionally, a link between JNK and BCL-2 was found, where JNK mediated BCL-2 phosphorylation, and the inactivation of JNK inhibited paclitaxel-induced BCL-2 phosphorylation (33Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). This establishes the important roles of BCL-2 and JNK family members in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, although other cell death and cell survival pathways are likely to either enhance or intercede with this cytotoxicity. One of the findings described here is that paclitaxel also enhances the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, which is expected to increase cell proliferation and survival, and may compromise the efficacy of paclitaxel in cancer treatment. Based on a molecular approach, this report describes a novel discovery that treatment with paclitaxel combined with the inhibition of MEK1/2 lead to enhanced apoptosis of lung, ovarian, and breast carcinoma cell lines. Two pharmacologic agents, paclitaxel and U0126, respectively, caused JNK activation that promotes apoptosis, and MEK inhibition, which leads to cell cycle arrest. The two combined resulted in an impressive enhancement of tumor cell killing. In summary, these findings illustrate the power of molecular and rational drug targeting. Paclitaxel and MEK inhibitor combination therapy may allow the use of lower drug doses, likely leading to lowered toxicity and enhanced tumor killing in vivo. The implications of these findings are broad for the potential clinical usage of paclitaxel plus MEK inhibitors by: 1) improving the response rate and 2) expanding the usefulness of paclitaxel in the treatment of resistant tumors that affects a large percentage of cancer patients.

Their amino-terminal globular domains bind to hyaluronan, but the function of their carboxyl-terminal globular domains has long remained elusive. A picture is now emerging where the C-type lectin motif of this domain mediates binding to other extracellular matrix proteins. We here demonstrate that aggrecan, versican, and brevican lectin domains bind fibulin-2, whereas neurocan does not. As expected for a C-type lectin, the interactions are calcium-dependent, with KD values in the nanomolar range as measured by surface plasmon resonance. Solid phase competition assays with previously identified ligands demonstrated that fibulin-2 and tenascin-R bind the same site on the proteoglycan lectin domains. Fibulin-1 has affinity for the common site on versican but may bind to a different site on the aggrecan lectin domain. By using deletion mutants, the interaction sites for aggrecan and versican lectin domains were mapped to epidermal growth factor-like repeats in domain II of fibulin-2. Affinity chromatography and solid phase assays confirmed that also native full-length aggrecan and versican bind the lectin domain ligands.

C-type lectin domain recombinant CLD alkaline phosphatase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin epidermal growth factor The large aggregating proteoglycans referred to as lecticans (1Ruoslahti E. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) or hyalectans (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) are ubiquitous extracellular matrix components. The family consists of aggrecan, versican, brevican, and neurocan. Aggrecan is expressed by chondrocytes in cartilage. Versican is found in many tissues, e.g. blood vessels and dermis expressed by smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Brevican and neurocan are found in the central nervous system, expressed by astrocytes and neuronal cells, respectively. These proteoglycans have important functions in many tissues. Aggrecan, for example, with its many glycosaminoglycan side chains and thus high fixed charge density gives rise to a pronounced osmotic swelling pressure that is crucial for the biomechanical properties of cartilage (3Heinegård D. Oldberg A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2042-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 4Maroudas A. Freeman M.A.R. Adult Articular Cartilage. Pitman Medical, Kent, UK1979: 215-290Google Scholar). The core proteins of these proteoglycans are organized with a central elongated glycosaminoglycan-carrying part of variable length, flanked by globular domains mediating interactions with other matrix molecules (5Doege K.

The amino-terminal globular G1 domains bind to hyaluronan in interactions stabilized by link protein (10Heinegård D. Hascall V.C. J. Biol.

The carboxyl-terminal globular G3 domain consists of one or two EGF repeats, a C-type lectin-like domain (CLD),1and a sushi repeat. It has recently been shown that the CLDs function in binding. So far four ligands have been identified as follows: the brain-specific extracellular matrix protein tenascin-R (14Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26905-26912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), sulfated glycolipids (17Miura R. Aspberg A. Ethell I.M. Hagihara K. Schnaar R.L. Ruoslahti E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The CLDs of the lecticans are highly conserved; the amino acid sequence of the chick versican CLD, for example, is 96% identical to the human homologue. This high degree of conservation suggests that the CLD motif of the G3 domain has important functions. We propose that one of these functions is to organize the forming hyaluronan-lectican complexes in the assembly of the extracellular matrix. This can be achieved through binding other matrix components with multiple lectican CLD-binding sites. Several of the CLD ligands identified so far are multimeric proteins as follows: tenascin-R is a dimer or trimer (19Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), tenascin-C is a hexamer (20Chiquet M. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Erickson H.P. Inglesias J.L. Nature. 1984; 311: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and fibulin-1 may self-assemble (22Pan T.C. Kluge M. Zhang R.Z. Mayer U. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,23Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all these cases the lectican CLD binding is directed to extended rod-like stretches of the multimeric extracellular matrix molecules. These proteins are thus excellent candidates for cross-linking the hyaluronan-lectican complexes. Due to the very large size of the link protein-stabilized hyaluronan-lectican complexes, such cross-linking is probably not critical to retain the lecticans in the mature extracellular matrix. Indeed, previous studies have shown that although proteolytic cleavage of aggrecan leads to a progressive loss of the G3 domain with aging (9Paulsson M. Mörgelin M. Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T. Heinegård D. Timpl R. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the hyaluronan-aggrecan complexes are still retained in the tissue. Cross-linking may, however, be of importance in the extracellular matrix formation during development and in response to damage. Support for this notion is found in heart development. In the heart defect (Hdf) mice, truncation of the versican gene by insertion of a transgene resulted in heart malformation and embryonic lethality (24Yamamura H. Zhang M. Markwald R.R. Mjaatvedt C.H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 186: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Mjaatvedt C.H. Yamamura H. Capehart A.A. Turner D. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, fibulin-1 and -2 are produced together with versican and hyaluronan in the endocardial cushion tissue (26Miosge N. Sasaki T. Chu M.L. Herken R. Timpl R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting involvement of the fibulins in organization of the hyaluronan-versican complexes of the developing heart extracellular matrix. The fibulins are a growing family of extracellular matrix proteins (27Giltay R. Timpl R. Kostka G. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Like fibulin-1, fibulin-2 is an extended protein containing two globular domains. The carboxyl-terminal domain III corresponds to the novel FBLC (fibulin/fibrillin carboxyl-terminal domain) motif (27Giltay R. Timpl R. Kostka G. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The other globular domain, I, consists of three anaphylatoxin-like repeats. The rod-like domain II, which is composed of EGF-like repeats, connect the two globular domains. Fibulin-2 contains an additional rod-like amino-terminal domain (28Pan T.C. Sasaki T. Zhang R.Z. Fässler R. Timpl R. Chu M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Zhang Z.Y. Mattei M.G. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Genomics. 1994; 22: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fibulin-1 can form dimers but is predominantly found as in the monomeric form. Fibulin-2, on the other hand, forms disulfide-linked dimers (30Sasaki T. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Göhring W. Lustig A. Engel J. Chu M.L. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3035-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interactions between domains N and II give the fibulin-2 dimers a polymorph shape with X-, Y-, or rod-shaped dimers (30Sasaki T. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Göhring W. Lustig A. Engel J. Chu M.L. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3035-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). During development, fibulins are broadly expressed (31Spence S.G. Argraves W.S. Walters L. Hungerford J.E. Little C.D. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Zhang H.Y. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Chu M.L. Ekblom P. Dev.

J. 1996; 28: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with particularly high levels in the developing heart valves (26Miosge N. Sasaki T. Chu M.L. Herken R. Timpl R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 606-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Zhang H.Y. Chu M.L. Pan T.C. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the adult, both fibulin-1 and -2 are found in microfibrils and in many other tissue structures, notably in basement membranes and vessel walls (28Pan T.C. Sasaki T. Zhang R.Z. Fässler R. Timpl R. Chu M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35Kluge M. Mann K. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Eur. J.

Cytochem. 1995; 43: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We here show that fibulin-2 also is a strong ligand for several lecticans. They interact through their lectin domains with two different binding sites in domain II of fibulin-2. The dimeric nature of fibulin-2 allows for efficient cross-linking of hyaluronan-lectican complexes, which could play an essential role in the supramolecular organization of cartilaginous and other extracellular matrices. The construction of His-tagged rCLD mammalian expression pCEP4 plasmids have previously been described (15Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A cDNA coding for alkaline phosphatase (AP) was inserted into the pCEP4 plasmid at the SalI site between the lectin domains and the histidine tags. The AP cDNA was amplified from the AP-tag-1 plasmid (37Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-GACCGTCGACCATCATCCCAGTTGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CAGCGTCGACCCAGGGTGCGCGG-3′. All expression constructions were sequenced before use. The resulting expression vectors code for fusion proteins containing an immunoglobulin signal peptide, a C-type lectin-like domain, soluble alkaline phosphatase, and a hexahistidine tag. The recombinant proteins were produced in human embryonal kidney 293-EBNA cells and purified from the cell culture medium through metal affinity chromatography as described previously (18Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The production of most of the recombinant fibulin-2 proteins has been described previously(30). The novel fragments EG + III (position 1036–1195), (EG)2 + III (position 993–1195), IIb–e (position 730–912), and Iid–g (position 821–993) were produced by amplifying the corresponding regions of the cDNA. Primers were used in the polymerase chain reaction that introduced an NheI site immediately upstream and an XbaI site immediately downstream the fibulin-2 fragment. The resulting products were then introduced into the pCEP-Pu mammalian expression vector containing the BM-40 signal peptide (38Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins all contain the vector-derived amino acid sequence APLA preceding the first amino acid residue of the fibulin-2 fragment. The recombinant proteins were produced in 293-EBNA cells, purified, and characterized as described previously (30Sasaki T. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Göhring W. Lustig A. Engel J. Chu M.L. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3035-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The different rCLDs were diluted with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and immobilized in different flow cells of a CM5 sensorchip (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Immobilization levels were between 1500 and 2000 resonance units, as described previously (18Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For affinity measurements, binding and dissociation were monitored in a BIAcore 2000 instrument. The recombinant proteins were injected at different concentrations over the rCLD-coated surfaces at 35 μl/min (in running buffer: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, and 1 mm CaCl2, 25 °C). A flow cell subjected to the coupling reaction without protein was used as a control for bulk resonance changes. The lectin surfaces were regenerated by injection of a 200-μl pulse of running buffer containing 20 mm EDTA followed by 50 μl of 20 mm CaCl2 between each experiment. In control experiments with the same concentrations of recombinant proteins, but with 5 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2 in the running buffer, no binding was seen. Bacterially expressed fibronectin type III repeats 3–5 from rat tenascin-R were used as a positive control (18Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After X and Y normalization the blank curves from the control flow cell were subtracted, and association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants were determined using a global simultaneous Langmuir fit in the BiaEvaluation 3.0 program. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated from these values. Microtiter wells (NUNC Maxisorp, Nalge, Denmark) were coated at room temperature overnight with 1.5 μg/ml tenascin R, fibulin-1C, and fibulin-2 II + III, respectively. The wells were washed with TTBS-Ca (5 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), incubated 1–2 h with blocking solution (3% BSA in TTBS), and washed with BSA/TTBS-Ca (0.3% BSA in TTBS-Ca). Potential inhibitors, i.e. the proteins used for coating, were loaded into the wells in triplicates starting at a dilution of 400 nm together with 1 μg/ml (14 nm) of AP-tagged lectin domain (AcL-AP-his, NcL-AP-his, and VcL-AP-his, respectively) or AP alone in BSA/TTBS-Ca and incubated 1 h. After washing extensively with TTBS-Ca, substrate (1 mg/ml ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate in 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5) was added, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured after a 1-h incubation. Swarm rat chondrosarcoma tumor tissue was dissected free of surrounding fascia and sliced with a razor blade, and 200 g were briefly homogenized (Polytron homogenizer, Kinematica GmbH, Switzerland) in 1 liter (5 ml/g tissue) of prechilled TBS-Ca (5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (39Mörgelin M. Engel J. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14275-14284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting tissue dispersion was extracted for 45 min at 4 °C with stirring after which residues were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 rpm (4 °C, Beckman J2–21, JA-20 rotor, 48, 400 × gav). This extraction cycle was repeated twice. The residual tissue was then extracted 3 times, 2 times for 60 min, and finally overnight, as described above in TBS-EDTA (10 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors. For anion exchange a DE52 cellulose (Whatman) 10 × 5-cm column was equilibrated with 20 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, loaded with supernatants from the Ca2 + and EDTA extractions, washed, and eluted using a gradient of 20 mm to 2 m NaCl over 2 bed volumes. The flow rate was 25 ml/h, and fractions of 4 ml were collected. Aliquots of the fractions were analyzed for contents of specific proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and sequential Alcian Blue and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Fractions with proteoglycan retained in the stacking gel were pooled (140 ml) and taken to gel filtration on a Sepharose CL-2B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 100 × 5-cm column equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The flow rate was 40 ml/h, and 10-ml fractions were collected. As a final concentration step, size-excluded material of interest was loaded onto another DE52 cellulose 13 × 1-cm column and chromatographed as described above. The flow rate was 10 ml/h, and fractions of 5 ml were collected. MG63 osteosarcoma cells (CRL 1427; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Versican was prepared by anion exchange chromatography of conditioned culture medium. For batch binding, 10 ml of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to 1 liter of medium (1% v/v) containing 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was packed into a column, washed with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and versican was eluted with a 0–2 m NaCl gradient over 20 column bed volumes. Versican containing fractions were identified by dot blotting with monoclonal antibody 12C5 (40Asher R. Perides G. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Bignami A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), pooled, and concentrated. Aggrecan and versican were dialyzed against 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3. They were digested with 10 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) per mg of proteoglycan for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μg/ml ovomucoid as protease inhibitor. The aggrecan digest was chromatographed on a Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 140 × 1-cm column equilibrated and eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Flow rates were 10 ml/h, and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. The versican digest was loaded onto a Mono-Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 1-ml column and eluted using a gradient of 0–2 m NaCl over 10 column bed volumes. Chondroitinase ABC-treated aggrecan and versican were radiolabeled using125I and IODO-BEADS (Pierce) and were recovered in TTBS-Ca (5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Labeled material was affinity-purified on recombinant tenascin-R fibronectin type III repeats 3–5 (15Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After an extensive wash with TTBS-Ca, bound material was eluted with TTBS-EDTA (10 mm EDTA). Microtiter wells (Breakable Combiplate-Enhanced Binding, Labsystems Oy, Finland) were coated with 1.5 μg/ml tenascin-R, fibulin-1C, or fibulin-2 in 10 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, overnight at room temperature in a humid chamber. After washing the wells with TTBS-Ca or TTBS-EDTA, radiolabeled and affinity-purified aggrecan or versican at different concentrations was added at a starting dilution of 100,000 and 40,000 cpm/well, respectively, in triplicates in either TTBS-Ca or TTBS-EDTA. After overnight incubation the wells were extensively washed and counted in a gamma counter (Packard Cobra II Quantum, Packard Instrument Co.). Glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing, negative staining, and evaluation of the data from electron micrographs were carried out as described previously (41Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For rotary shadowing 20-μl aggrecan samples (typical concentrations 10–20 μg/ml) were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.2 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 7.9. They were subsequently mixed with equal volumes of 80% glycerol and sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica with a nebulizer designed for small volumes. They were dried in vacuum and shadowed under rotation with 2 nm platinum/carbon at 9°, followed by coating with a stabilizing 10 nm carbon film. For negative staining 5-μl samples of complexes between fibulins and native aggrecan or fibulins and rCLDs (typical concentrations 5–10 μg/ml in TBS/5 mm CaCl2) were adsorbed to 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grids, washed briefly with water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. Since the rCLDs alone were too small to be visualized, we used AP-tagged proteins. After mixing the proteins in equimolar amounts, they were incubated 1 h before adsorption of the formed complexes to grids. Aggrecan complexes, affinity purified as above, were also mixed with an affinity-purified antibody against the aggrecan lectin domain to distinguish the G3 domain of the core protein. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. In some experiments the fibulins or rCLDs were labeled with colloidal thiocyanate gold (42Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Specimens were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60-kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 plates without preirradiation at a dose of typically 2000 electrons/square nm. Mouse tissues were fixed in 95% ethanol, 1% acetic acid, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-μm sections, and immunostained as described previously (18Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegård D.

Fibulin-2 bound strongly to the rCLDs of aggrecan, versican, and brevican lectin domains in BIAcore experiments (Fig. 1). In contrast, fibulin-2 showed no binding to the neurocan rCLD, whereas this protein was functional and bound tenascin-R (not shown). There was only a very slow dissociation of fibulin-2 bound to aggrecan (Fig.1 A) or versican (Fig. 1 C) rCLD, whereas the fibulin-brevican rCLD complex showed more pronounced dissociation (Fig.1 B). All interactions depended completely on calcium ions as expected for C-type lectins (not shown). The KD values of the proteoglycan rCLD interactions with fibulin-2 were in the subnanomolar to nanomolar range (TableI).Table IDissociation constants for the interactions between the different lectican rCLDs and fibulin-2, fibulin-1C, fibulin-1D, and tenascin-RFibulin-2 KDFibulin-1C KDFibulin-1D KDTenascin-R KDnmnmnmnmAggrecan0.1321112Versican0.1143815Brevican1.8NBNB1NeurocanNBNBNB31Data were obtained by surface plasmon resonance analysis.

In solid phase assays using a surface coated with fibulin-2, we allowed alkaline phosphatase-tagged aggrecan or versican rCLD to bind to the coated protein in the presence of varying concentrations of the different ligands (tenascin-R FnIII-repeat 3–5, fibulin-1C, and fibulin-2). Binding of versican rCLD to the immobilized ligand protein could be inhibited by any of the other proteins (Fig.2 B). Aggrecan rCLD binding to fibulin-2 could only be inhibited by tenascin-R and fibulin-2 but not by fibulin-1C at a 20-fold molar excess (Fig. 2 A). In assays using surfaces coated with the ligands tenascin-R FnIII 3–5 and fibulin-1C (not shown), binding of versican rCLD could be equally inhibited by all three competitors. Aggrecan rCLD binding to tenascin-R was not inhibited by fibulin-1C in solution, and this rCLD did not bind to a fibulin-1C surface (not shown). Neurocan rCLD and AP alone did not bind to the coated fibulin surfaces (not shown). To obtain full-length aggrecan, we extracted and purified rat chondrosarcoma under native conditions. The associatively extracted aggrecan is present in its ternary complex together with hyaluronan and link protein (44Faltz L.L. Reddi A.H. Hascall G.K. Martin D. Pita J.C. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After digestion with chondroitinase ABC, the core protein was radioiodinated and affinity-purified on the rCLD-binding tenascin-R FnIII 3–5 fragment (Fig.3 A). Bound aggrecan was eluted with EDTA, taking advantage of the calcium dependence of CLD binding. SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted material (Fig. 3 B) shows accumulation of aggrecan core protein in the full-length molecular weight range, fragments, and copurified link protein. We confirmed that the eluted material consisted of full-length aggrecan core protein rich in globular domains G1, G2, and G3 (9Paulsson M. Mörgelin M. Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T. Heinegård D. Timpl R. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing electron microscopy (Fig. 3 D). The nonbinding fraction, however, contained the pair of G1 and G2 domains at the amino terminus but lacked in most cases the carboxyl-terminal domain G3 (Fig.3 C). In the proteoglycan G3 domain the CLD is flanked by EGF and sushi repeats. To determine whether these motifs influence the CLD ligand binding, we performed solid phase binding assays with the affinity-purified radioiodinated full-length aggrecan. The full-length proteoglycan indeed shows the same binding characteristics as the aggrecan rCLD. Aggrecan binds tenascin-R (Fig.4 A) and fibulin-2 (Fig.4 C) in a calcium-dependent"

Gelsolin was also recently suggested to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis: human gelsolin (hGsn) has anti-apoptotic activity, whereas mouse gelsolin (mGsn) exerts either proapoptotic or anti-apoptotic activity depending on different cell types. Here, we studied the basis of anti-apoptotic activity of hGsn. We showed that both endogenous and overexpressed hGsn has anti-apoptotic activity, that depends on its C-terminal half. We also found that hGsn and its C-terminal half but not mGsn could prevent apoptotic mitochondrial changes such as Δψ loss and cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria to a similar extent as Bcl-xL, indicating that hGsn targets the mitochondria to prevent apoptosis via its C-terminal half. In the same way as anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, which we recently found to prevent apoptotic mitochondrial changes by binding and closing the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), hGsn and its C-terminal half inhibited the activity of VDAC on liposomes through direct binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner. These results suggest that hGsn inhibits apoptosis by blocking mitochondrial VDAC activity."

In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the occurrence of another layer of eukaryotic transcription activation mediated by protein complexes that alter chromatin conformation. Components of these complexes are conserved, underscoring the importance of their regulatory role (reviewed in Ref.1Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Chromatin-remodeling complexes can be grouped into two broad categories: those that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter nucleosomal conformation (e.g. SWI/SNF in yeast,Drosophila, and mammals; RSC, ISW1, and ISW2 in yeast; NURF, CHRAC, and ACF in Drosophila; and RSF and WCRF in mammals) and those that are recruited to alter chromatin conformation via the acetylation of histones (e.g. NuA4,1 NuA3, ADA, Elongator, and SAGA in yeast and TAFII250, human GCN5, p/CAF, SRC-1/ACTR, and CBP/p300 complexes in mammals) or their deacetylation (reviewed in Refs. 2Vignali M.

The mechanisms whereby the enzymatic functions identified with these complexes are translated into the modulation of transcription still remain largely unresolved. Significant insights into the functional aspects of chromatin remodeling can be garnered by comparing complexes that share homologous components in different model systems where specific biochemical and genetic tools are available. We have begun such an analysis by studying two complexes with homologous protein subunits, the dosage compensation or MSL complex of Drosophila melanogaster and the NuA4 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Drosophila, the transcription of most genes on the single male X chromosome is increased 2-fold relative to the transcription of the same genes on each of the two female X chromosomes (6Cline T.W. Meyer B.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 637-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 7Lucchesi J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This compensation for the difference in dosage of X-linked genes between males and females requires a group of gene products: MLE (maleless); MSL1, MSL2, and MSL3 (male-specific lethal 1, 2, and 3, respectively), and MOF (males absent on the first), known collectively as the MSLs for their male-specific lethal loss-of-function phenotype. In males, the MSLs form a complex with roX RNA that binds the X chromosome along numerous sites and that results in the presence of a particular isoform of histone H4 acetylated at lysine 16 (8–13). The enzymatic activity of two members of the complex has been established: MLE is an RNA helicase (14Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Kuroda M.I. Kernan M.J. Kreber B. Ganetzky B. Baker B.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 935-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) that exhibits 49% identity and 85% similarity to mammalian RNA helicase A (16Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MOF is a histone acetyltransferase from the MYST family responsible for the X-specific acetylation of H4 at lysine 16 (11, 17–19). The yeast homolog of MOF, Esa1p (essential Sas2-related acetyltransferase-1protein), expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria, acetylates free histone H4 in vitro (20Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Clarke A.S. Lowell J.E. Jacobson S.J. Pillus L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2515-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although a replacement of the ESA1 gene is lethal, a mutation in a conserved glycine in the acetyl-CoA-binding site of Esa1p, which results in male-specific lethality in theDrosophila MOF protein and eliminates the acetyltransferase activity of the recombinant protein in vitro, has no observable phenotypic effect on yeast viability (20Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In contrast, temperature-sensitive point mutations in Esa1p were recently shown to arrest cells at the G2/M border in aRAD9-dependent manner, suggesting that Esa1p activity is essential for cell cycle progression (21Clarke A.S. Lowell J.E. Jacobson S.J. Pillus L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2515-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Esa1p is a component of the 1.3-MDa NuA4 chromatin-remodeling complex and is responsible for its HAT activity (22Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Côté J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This complex stimulates transcription mediated by a variety of activation domains in vitro in a chromatin- and acetyl-CoA-dependent manner, i.e. through histone acetylation (23Utley R.T. Ikeda K.

Wright A.P.H. Grant P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5952-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another component of the NuA4 complex is the ATM-related cofactor Tra1p (22Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Côté J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Tra1p is also essential for growth; and its human ortholog, TRRAP, interacts directly with c-Myc and E2F activation domains and is required for their cell-transforming activities (27McMahon S.B.

These observations suggest that NuA4 is required to modulate expression of genes important for cell cycle control. In this study, we report that a second yeast protein, homologous to a component of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex, is also a subunit of the NuA4 complex. This protein, which we call Eaf3p (Esa1p-associatedfactor-3protein), has extensive similarity to Drosophila MSL3. To elucidate the role of Eaf3p and the other common component of the NuA4 and MSL complexes (Esa1p) and their functional interaction within theDrosophila and yeast complexes, we performed a genetic and biochemical analysis of NuA4 complexes isolated from various mutant strains. Our results demonstrate that Esa1p and Eaf3p are integral components of the NuA4 complex. In contrast to the role of MSL3 in theDrosophila complex, Eaf3p is not essential for growth; this is consistent with our finding that a NuA4 complex lacking this component exhibits normal levels of histone acetyltransferase activityin vitro. Consistent with the important but subtle 2-fold effect on transcription of the dosage compensation complex, we show that a strain lacking Eaf3p has an ∼2-fold decrease in the transcription of specific target genes. Strains were grown at 30 °C in rich (yeast extract/Bacto-peptone/dextrose (YPD)) or minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate nutrients. Medium containing 6-azauracil (Sigma) was made by addition of the appropriate concentration of a sterile solution of the drug (dissolved in 1m ammonium hydroxide) to autoclaved and cooled minimal medium. Media for potential mutant phenotypes were prepared as follows. A sterile stock solution of sorbitol was added directly to complete medium to a concentration of 1 m. HCl was added to YPD to a pH of 2.5 before autoclaving. EGTA and NaCl were added to YPD to concentrations of 10 and 900 mm, respectively. 3% lactate or ethanol medium was prepared by adding a sterile stock solution of the respective carbon source to autoclaved complete medium or to minimal medium lacking glucose. A sterile stock solution of caffeine was added to autoclaved YPD to a concentration of 8 mm. Benomyl was dissolved in chloroform and then added to autoclaved complete medium. S. cerevisiae strains FY73 (Matαhis3Δ200 ura3-52) and FY23 (Mat a ura3-52 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63) were the wild-type host strains and were used either as haploids or crossed to create diploids for mutational analysis. Strain CY396 was used for preparative purification of the NuA4 complex and has been described (29Peterson C.L. Dingwall A. Scott M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The esa1-G315E mutant strain has been described previously (20Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G.

The following oligonucleotides were used to create an EAF3 replacement cassette from the plasmid pFA6-kanMX2 (provided by Gray Crouse): 5′-AGGCCTCGTCACTGGATTTACCCTATTGAAGAACGTATACAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′ and 5′-TAAATACTAGAAATAATCCCAAGCTAGAATATAAACGTCGCAAACGTCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′. For both liquid and solid media assays, yeast cells were inoculated in liquid YPD and grown overnight. For liquid media assays, cells were washed, re-inoculated at a low concentration (A 600 < 0.1) in the appropriate medium, and grown at the appropriate temperature, and A 600was recorded every 3–5 h for 24–48 h. For plate assays, cells were re-inoculated in the appropriate medium from an overnight YPD culture, grown to log phase, washed, plated at a density of 500–1000 cells, and incubated at appropriate temperatures. Number of colonies and their time of appearance were recorded. Pfu polymerase and primers 5′-GGAATTCAGTATAATGGTTGATTTGGAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CTACTCGAGCTTGGGGGTTGGATAGC-3′ or primers 5′-GGAATTCAGCGTGTTAGTCGACGATTGGGAATACG-3′ and 5′-ACGCCTCGAGGTCTCACATACCTAAAGCCACTCC-3′ were used to amplify DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 1–219 and 205–401, respectively, of Eaf3p from cosmid 9367 (provided by the Yeast Genome Project). These polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into ZeroBlunt (Invitrogen), removed by digestion with Eco RI and Sal I, and inserted into the GST fusion expression vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to make pGEX-NEaf3 and pGEX-CEaf3, respectively. These vectors were transformed into BL21 cells (Novagen), and fusion protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h. Cells were then washed and sonicated, and the pellet and supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein harboring the C-terminal part of Eaf3p was excised from the gel, electroeluted, and injected into guinea pig and rabbit (PRF&L Antibody Production Services). The serum used was either crude or purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column harboring the purified GST fusion protein. His-tagged recombinant Esa1p was produced by cloning in pET15b (Novagen) a polymerase chain reaction fragment produced by primers 5′-GCGGGATCCGTCCCATGACGGAAAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCTCCCAGGCAAAGCGTAACT-3′ from yeast genomic DNA (usingBam HI sites for subcloning). Purified recombinant Esa1p was eluted from nickel-agarose resin at 160 mmimidazole. Partially purified and affinity-purified anti-Esa1p sera have been described (22Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J.

Typically, a 1-μl fraction was tested for HAT activity on 0.5 μg of oligonucleosomes for 30 min at 30 °C. When indicated, peak nucleosomal H4/H2A-specific acetyltransferase activity (NuA4) from the Mono Q salt gradient elution was pooled and concentrated to 0.6 ml with a Centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). The sample was then split and run successively on a calibrated Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer A (32Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L.

Fractions (0.5 ml) were supplemented with 50 μg/ml insulin, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.

Visualization of histone specificity was obtained by loading the reactions on an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by Coomassie Blue staining to ensure equivalent loading of histones in each lane, destaining, and fluorography with Enhance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The immunopurified 47-kDa NuA4 SDS-PAGE excised band was subjected to gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Multiple peptide sequences were determined in a single run by a microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography directly coupled to an LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT) equipped with a custom nanoelectrospray source. The column was packed in-house with 5 cm of C18 support into a one-piece 75-μm inner diameter column terminating in a 15-μm tip (New Objective). The flow rate was 190 nl/min. The ion trap was programmed to acquire successive sets of three scan modes consisting of full-scan mass spectrometry over alternating ranges of 395–800 or 800–1300 m/z, followed by two data-dependent scans on the most abundant ion in those full scans. These dependent scans allowed the automatic acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass and tandem mass spectra for peptide sequence information at low femtomole quantities. Tandem mass spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30%, an isolation width of 2.5 Da, and recurring ions dynamically excluded. Interpretation of the resulting tandem mass spectra of the peptides was facilitated by programs developed in the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (34Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and by data base correlation with the algorithm SEQUEST (35Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). 10-μl fractions were typically used for Western blotting after electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting with anti-Esa1p, anti-Tra1p, and anti-Eaf3p sera was done as 1:3000, 1:2000, and 1:100 dilutions, respectively, in 1% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation studies, affinity-purified anti-Esa1p and anti-Eaf3p sera were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) following standard protocols (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Superose 6 NuA4 fractions were diluted in buffer B (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitors) to 150 mm NaCl and precleared with protein A-Sepharose. Precleared supernatants were incubated with preimmune or immune cross-linked beads for at least 3–4 h at 4 °C as a 30% slurry. After incubation, the beads were washed twice with buffer B containing 350 mm NaCl and twice with 150 mm NaCl. HAT assays were performed directly on equivalent amounts of supernatant or resuspended beads. When NuA4 subunits were visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, silver staining, or mass spectrometry, the complex was eluted from the beads with 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.5), neutralized, and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. For pull-down experiments, GST, GST-Eaf3p-(1–219), and GST-Eaf3p-(230–401) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose. 20 μl of beads (∼4 μg of fusion protein) were incubated in a 50-μl total volume with 0.8 μg of recombinant Esa1p (precleared on glutathione-Sepharose) in buffer B plus 100 mm NaCl and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in 10 volumes of the same buffer, and equivalent bound and unbound fractions were visualized by Western blotting with anti-Esa1p antibodies. Total yeast RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method (37Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting. The membrane was then hybridized to radiolabeled DNA probes in 0.5m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8, 7% SDS, and 1% bovine serum albumin. DNA probes were radiolabeled by random priming using a Multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The DNA fragments ofPHO5, HIS4, TRP4, GAL1, andACT1 employed in the labeling reaction were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers allowing amplification of the open reading frame (obtained from Research Genetics). Signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Data base comparisons have already revealed that MOF, a histone acetyltransferase of the MYST family involved inDrosophila dosage compensation, shows strong sequence similarity to the essential yeast protein Esa1p (17Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2054-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). This similarity extends beyond the ∼250-amino acid core of the protein family to include a region that contains a chromodomain (Fig.1 A). Data base comparisons also revealed that MSL3, another gene product involved inDrosophila dosage compensation, shares strong similarity with a protein encoded by the yeast open reading frame YPR023C that, because of the interactions described in this study, we have named Eaf3p. As shown in Fig. 1 B, these two gene products belong to a family of related proteins characterized by two chromodomain-containing regions (CRI and CRII) and three additional regions of similarity that we have designated as the EMM1, EMM2, and EMM3 boxes. The chromodomain contained in CRI is highly related to the chromodomain found in the histone acetyltransferases MOF and Esa1p. Since Esa1p is a component of the NuA4 transcription adaptor/histone H4 acetyltransferase complex (22Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Côté J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), we wished to investigate whether Eaf3p is also part of this complex. We partially purified NuA4 from whole cell extracts over a nickel-agarose resin, followed by Mono Q and Superose 6 columns (22Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Côté J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The Mono Q fractionation allowed separation of the four previously identified native HAT complexes (Fig.2 A) (31Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the NuA4 complex displayed nucleosomal H4 HAT activity (fractions 24–26). Western blot analysis showed strict coelution of Eaf3p with this activity and with two known components of NuA4, Esa1p and the ATM-related cofactor Tra1p (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, Eaf3p also specifically coeluted with NuA4 HAT activity and components from the subsequent gel filtration column (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that Eaf3p is associated with the 1.3-MDa complex.Figure 2Eaf3p coelutes with the 1.3-MDa NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex. A, a nickel-agarose-bound fraction of CY396 yeast strain protein extract was fractionated on Mono Q to separate the indicated HAT complexes. Fractions were tested for nucleosomal HAT activity and probed in Western blots. B, peak NuA4 fractions from Mono Q were pooled and loaded on a Superose 6 gel filtration column. Western blots showed Tra1p, Esa1p, and Eaf3p coelution with the 1.3-MDa NuA4 HAT activity (fractions 19–23).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate a physical association of Esa1p and Eaf3p, we used the anti-Eaf3p antibody in an immunoprecipitation assay with the peak NuA4 fraction from the Superose 6 column. Whereas incubation with preimmune serum left NuA4 activity in the supernatant, anti-Eaf3p beads brought down a significant amount of activity with a concomitant depletion from the supernatant (Fig.3 A). In the reciprocal experiment, Eaf3p was completely depleted with anti-Esa1p antibodies and was fully recovered on the beads (Fig. 3 B). This clearly demonstrates the stable association of Eaf3p with Esa1p in the NuA4 complex. Preparative immunoprecipitation using anti-Esa1p antibodies was then performed to visualize NuA4 subunits as described previously (22Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Côté J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A silver-stained gel of the purified complex is shown in Fig.3 C. The NuA4 stoichiometric subunits are marked on the left, and two are close to the molecular mass predicted for Eaf3p,i.e. p44 and p47. In a separate report, p44 was identified as Act1p, cellular actin (38Galarneau L. Nourani A. Boudreault A.A. Zhang Y. Héliot L. Allard S. Savard J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Côté J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The p47 band was excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC/nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The 15 peptides obtained correspond to sequences from the EAF3 gene product and cover 45% of the 401-amino acid protein (Fig. 3 D,boldface). Together, these data establish Eaf3p as a stable stoichiometric subunit of the yeast NuA4 complex. A deletion of the ESA1 gene is lethal (20Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J.

However, how the binding of these targeting subunits to the A/C heterodimer might be regulated is unknown. We have used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to investigate the hypothesis that covalent modification of the C subunit (Pph21p/Pph22p) carboxyl terminus modulates PP2A complex formation. Two approaches were taken. First, S. cerevisiae cells were generated whose survival depended on the expression of different carboxyl-terminal Pph21p mutants. Second, the major S. cerevisiae methyltransferase (Ppm1p) that catalyzes the methylation of the PP2A C subunit carboxyl-terminal leucine was identified, and cells deleted for this methyltransferase were utilized for our studies. Our results demonstrate that binding of the yeast B subunit, Cdc55p, to Pph21p was disrupted by either acidic substitution of potential carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites on Pph21p or by deletion of the gene for Ppm1p. Loss of Cdc55p association was accompanied in each case by a large reduction in binding of the yeast A subunit, Tpd3p, to Pph21p. Moreover, decreased Cdc55p and Tpd3p binding invariably resulted in nocodazole sensitivity, a known phenotype of CDC55 or TPD3 deletion. Furthermore, loss of methylation also greatly reduced the association of another yeast B-type subunit, Rts1p. Thus, methylation of Pph21p is important for formation of PP2A trimeric and dimeric complexes, and consequently, for PP2A function. Taken together, our results indicate that methylation and phosphorylation may be mechanisms by which the cell dynamically regulates PP2A complex formation and function.

Although it is clear that binding of B-type targeting subunits is a major mechanism by which cells regulate PP2A, how the binding of these targeting subunits to the A/C heterodimer might be regulated is unknown. Recently, we showed in mammalian cells that deletion of nine C subunit carboxyl-terminal residues (amino acids 301–309) or nonconservative substitution of threonine 304 or tyrosine 307 abolished the ability of the C subunit to form complexes with the B subunit (10Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we postulated that reversible covalent modification at the C subunit carboxyl terminus might regulate B subunit binding. Previous studies showed that both phosphorylation and methylation occur on the C subunit carboxyl terminus. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 307 in vitro by pp60c-src results in 90% inhibition of PP2A activity (16Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Substitution of this same tyrosine with an acidic residue abolishes binding of the A/C heterodimer to B subunit in vivo, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue might do the same (10Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PP2A is also known to be inhibited by phosphorylation of an unknown threonine residue (17Guo H. Damuni Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and interestingly, substitution of threonine 304, located in the carboxyl terminus of the C subunit, also abolishes B subunit binding (10Ogris E.

Because PP2A methylation is reversible and the methyltransferase (23De Baere I. Derua R. Janssens V. Van Hoof C. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Goris J.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome contains two genes (PPH21 and PPH22) encoding PP2A catalytic subunits (27Sneddon A.A. Cohen P.T. Stark M.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4339-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and a single A subunit gene, TPD3 (28van Zyl W. Huang W. Sneddon A.A. Stark M. Camier S. Werner M. Marck C. Sentenac A. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4946-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Deletion of either PPH21 or PPH22 alone has no effect on yeast growth, although PP2A activity is reduced by 51 and 33%, respectively (27Sneddon A.A. Cohen P.T. Stark M.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4339-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Double deletion of both genes results in severe slow growth and a temperature-sensitive phenotype (29Ronne H. Carlberg M. Hu G.Z. Nehlin J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4876-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Additional deletion of the PPH3 gene, which encodes a nonessential protein phosphatase that has residual overlapping function with PP2A, leads to cell death (29Ronne H. Carlberg M. Hu G.Z. Nehlin J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4876-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae has two B-type subunits, Cdc55p and Rts1p, that are, respectively, homologous to the B and B′ mammalian B-type subunit families (30Healy A.M. Zolnierowicz S. Stapleton A.E. Goebl M.

Cells lacking Cdc55p or Tpd3p are sensitive to drugs such as nocodazole and benomyl, which perturb microtubule stability, presumably because forms of PP2A containing these subunits are important for normal mitotic spindle checkpoint function (32Minshull J.

Although only one S. cerevisiae methylesterase homolog (Ppe1p) exists that was found to be nonessential for growth under normal conditions (26Ogris E. Du X. Nelson K.C. Mak E.K., Yu, X.X. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol.

Janssens V. Van Hoof C. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16539-16547Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) whose importance has not yet been determined. The first, Ppm1p, is highly homologous to the mammalian PP2A methyltransferase (PMT1) that was recently cloned, expressed, and shown to have activity by De Baere et al. (23De Baere I. Derua R. Janssens V. Van Hoof C. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16539-16547Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These authors also reported the existence of a second homologous protein in both mammalian cells (PMT2) and S. cerevisiae (Ppm2p) that has ∼350 additional amino acids containing significant similarity to the kelch domain (23De Baere I. Derua R. Janssens V. Van Hoof C. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Goris J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16539-16547Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which has been implicated in actin binding. To date, Ppm1p, Ppm2p, and the human Ppm2p homolog have not been shown to have PP2A methyltransferase activity, and therefore, the relative contributions of these enzymes toward methylating PP2A in vivo are not known. We previously created a set of mutants targeting highly conserved residues in the carboxyl terminus of the mammalian PP2A catalytic (C) subunit. Several of these mutants showed decreased binding of B subunit and, in some cases, decreased C subunit methylation (10Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C.

Analysis of these cells together with strains deleted for the putative PP2A methyltransferase genes, PPM1 and PPM2, reveals that carboxymethylation of the yeast C subunit carboxyl terminus is required for the efficient assembly of PP2A heterotrimers containing Cdc55p or Rts1p. Given that C subunit methylation is known to be reversible and to oscillate in a cell cycle-dependent manner in mammalian cells, these results suggest that the cell may regulate B-type subunit binding and, consequently, PP2A function by modulating the methylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit. A 2.5-kilobase polymerase chain reaction product (forward primer, CGGGATCCGAGAGCAAATCGTTAAGTTCAGG; reverse primer, ACGCGTCGACGCTCAATACTCGAGTTATTCGTGTG) encoding the PPH21 gene was cut with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene). The two nucleotides preceding the ATG start codon were then mutated to CC by site-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis to create an NcoI site (CCATGG) that includes the start codon. Subsequently, site-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to create the T364A (codon change: ACG to GCT), T364D (codon change: ACG to GAC), Y367E (codon change: TAC to GAA), Y367F (codon change: TAC to TTC), and L369Δ (deleted codon) mutations. Wt and mutant PPH21 cDNAs were then subcloned into pRS316 (CEN6 URA3 amp) (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pPS310 (CEN6 URA3 GAL1–10 amp) (36Schlenstedt G. Saavedra C. Loeb J.D. Cole C.N. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Amino-terminal epitope-tagged versions of the mutants in pRS316 and pRS425 vectors were also made by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) followed by the thrombin recognition site (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) just before the start ATGs, making use of the NcoI site created previously. A pRS315 construct (RTS1::his6) expressing Rts1p with a carboxyl-terminal 6×His epitope tag (Rts1p-6×His) was obtained from R. Hallberg (37Shu Y. Hallberg R.L. Mol. Cell.

Strain YDP5D (MATa PPM1Δ::KAN PPM2Δ::KAN his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 met15) was made by mating YDP16650 and YDP4271, sporulating, and selecting the appropriate spore.

Rabbit anti-Cdc55p polyclonal antibody was raised to a fusion protein containing a 6×His tag fused to the first 193 amino acids of Cdc55p. Rabbit anti-Tpd3p antibody was raised to a fusion protein containing a amino-terminally 6×His-tagged Tpd3p protein lacking 64 amino-terminal amino acids and 38 carboxyl-terminal residues. Histidine tag (His probe; H-15) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Methylation-sensitive (binding inhibited by methylation of the C subunit) anti-PP2A C subunit monoclonal antibody clone 1d6 was generated against a 15-residue unmethylated carboxyl-terminal peptide with an additional amino-terminal cysteine added for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin2 and is now carried by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-HA tag antibodies, 12CA5 and 16B12, were obtained from Berkeley Antibody Co. (BAbCo). Cells were harvested and lysed as described (39Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), except that vortexing of cells with glass beads was done for 45 s intervals. Immunoprecipitation of PP2A complexes via HA-tagged wt or mutant C subunits (Pph21p) was performed using anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (12CA5) plus protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (39Sutton A. Immanuel D. Arndt K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2133-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), except that 300 μl of lysate was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibody for 90 min at 4 °C. In some immunoblots, anti-mouse κ light chain secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) were used to reduce background at the position of HA-tagged Pph21p. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C overnight. Cell numbers were counted, and cultures were diluted to ∼2 × 105 cells/ml and grown to log phase in medium containing 10 or 40 μg/ml nocodazole. At 0 (before nocodazole addition), 4, and 6 h, cells were removed and diluted 10-fold, and 50 μl was spread on each of three YPD plates. After incubation of these plates at 30 °C for 2 days, the percent survival of each sample was calculated by dividing the mean of the colony numbers at each time point by the mean of the colony numbers at time 0 and multiplying by 100. This assay2 uses a methylation-sensitive mouse monoclonal antibody (1d6) rather than a polyclonal antibody (20Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Turowski P. Fernandez A. Favre B. Lamb N.J. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to evaluate PP2A methylation. 1d6 was generated against an unmethylated PP2A carboxyl-terminal peptide and almost exclusively detects unmethylated PP2A. Fig. 5 A shows that its binding to a mammalian C subunit carboxyl-terminal nonapeptide is inhibited by methylation of the carboxyl-terminal leucine. The nonapeptide has only one conservative difference from the Pph22p sequence: a lysine instead of an arginine at its second position. 1d6 recognizes both unmethylated Pph21p and unmethylated Pph22p. 1d6 immunoblotting plus and minus base treatment can be used to determine the C subunit methylation status as described in the legend to Fig. 5 B. This method has the advantage over radiolabeling methylation assays in that it measures the steady-state methylation level of C subunit directly, avoiding potential problems with label uptake and incorporation. To investigate the possibility that PP2A might be regulated by reversible covalent modification of its carboxyl terminus, we previously created and analyzed a set of mutants targeting highly conserved residues in the carboxyl terminus of the mammalian PP2A catalytic (C) subunit (10Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (see examples in Table I). Several of these mutants showed decreased binding to B subunit (10Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and, in some cases, decreased C subunit methylation.2 The lack of a consistent phenotype in mammalian cells prompted us to move to a model system that was more amenable to genetic manipulation. Because the carboxyl terminus of PP2A is highly conserved from yeast to humans and PP2A methylation is conserved in yeast (40Lee J. Chen Y. Tolstykh T. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6043-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we chose to construct cDNAs expressing S. cerevisiae Pph21p versions of a subset of these mutants (T364A, T364D, Y367E, Y367F, and L369Δ; see “Materials and Methods” and Table I) and to study these mutants in S. cerevisiae cells whose viability depends on their expression.Table IB subunit binding of selected mammalian C subunit mutants and properties of the corresponding S. cerevisiae C subunit (Pph21p) mutants used in this studyMammalianS. cerevisiaeC subunit1-aData for mammalian C subunit mutants is taken from Ogris et al.

Open table in a new tab Ronne et al. (29Ronne H. Carlberg M. Hu G.Z. Nehlin J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4876-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) previously created an S. cerevisiae strain (H328) deleted for PPH21 and PPH3 that expresses Pph22p under control of the GAL promoter. H328 is viable when grown in the presence of galactose but is inviable on glucose, indicating that these cells are dependent on production of Pph22p from the galactose-inducible promoter for viability. To determine whether our Pph21p mutants could support viability, H328 cells were transformed with plasmids expressing wt or mutant C subunits or vector only and then grown on galactose or glucose. Fig. 1 shows that although H328 cells transformed with empty vector are inviable on glucose, all the mutants could support growth of these cells on glucose, indicating that these mutant proteins are functional. Because leucine 369 is the site of PP2A carboxymethylation in S. cerevisiae, this result also suggests that methylation of Pph21p is not essential for cell viability. We next analyzed amino-terminal HA-tagged versions of all the Pph21p carboxyl-terminal point mutants except L369Δ for their ability to bind Cdc55p by immunoprecipitating them via their epitope tag and immunoblotting for coimmunoprecipitated Cdc55p. For unknown reasons, the addition of an amino-terminal HA tag to L369Δ resulted in undetectable expression of this mutant using several different constructs, and HA-tagged L369Δ was unable to support the growth of H328 cells. As described under “Materials and Methods,” we raised a polyclonal antibody to Cdc55p to use in this assay. Fig.2 A shows the characterization of this antibody and the validation of the coimmunoprecipitation assay. As expected, the antibody detected a strong Cdc55p band in lysates from wt cells (lane 1) that was missing in lysates from cells deleted for CDC55 (ΔCDC55; lane 2). Preimmune serum from the same rabbit did not detect the Cdc55p band (not shown). In addition, the antibody easily detected Cdc55p coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged wt C subunit (lane 4), whereas a parallel immunoprecipitate (lane 3) from cells expressing untagged wt Pph21p had no detectable Cdc55p. Fig. 2 C shows the results of analyzing Cdc55p binding to all the Pph21p mutants except L369Δ. Although the control immunoprecipitate from cells expressing untagged Pph21p (lane 1) again contained no detectable Cdc55p, Cdc55p was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with wt HA-Pph21p and with the HA-tagged T364A and Y367F mutants (lanes 2, 3, and 6, respectively). In contrast, Cdc55p could not be detected in immunoprecipitates of T364D (lane 4) or Y367E (lane 5) even on long exposures. These results parallel those obtained previously with the corresponding mammalian mutants (Table I), indicating that the roles of these residues in B subunit binding are highly conserved. When these same immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Tpd3p antibody (characterized in Fig. 2 B), T364D and Y367E were found to bind greatly reduced levels of Tpd3p compared with wt Pph21p, T364A, and Y367F (Fig. 2 C). However, the effect of acidic substitution of Thr-364 and Tyr-367 on Tpd3p binding was less dramatic than on the association of Cdc55p. Decreased A subunit binding was also found previously for the corresponding mammalian C subunit tyrosine mutant (Y307E) but not for the corresponding mammalian threonine mutant (T304D) (10Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether loss of Cdc55p and Tpd3p binding affects the levels of these proteins in cells, lysates from cells expressing wt or mutant Pph21p proteins were probed with antibodies to these proteins. Similar levels of these two proteins were found in all samples (Fig.2 D), indicating that decreased binding did not impact protein stability in vivo. Previously, a strain deleted for CDC55 was reported to be cold-sensitive (30Healy A.M. Zolnierowicz S. Stapleton A.E. Goebl M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Pringle J.R. Mol."

We previously reported the generation and partial characterization of TTR-deficient (TTR−) mice. TTR− mice have very low circulating levels of retinol and its specific transport protein, retinol-binding protein (RBP). We have examined the biochemical basis for the low plasma retinol-RBP levels. Cultured primary hepatocytes isolated from wild type (WT) and TTR− mice accumulated RBP in their media to an identical degree, suggesting that RBP was being secreted from the hepatocytes at the same rate. In vivoexperiments support this conclusion. For the first 11 h after complete nephrectomy, the levels retinol and RBP rose in the circulations of WT and TTR− mice at nearly identical rates. However, human retinol-RBP injected intravenously was more rapidly cleared from the circulation (t12 = 0.5 h for TTR− versus t12 >6 h for WT) and accumulated faster in the kidneys of TTR− compared with WT mice. The rate of infiltration of the retinol-RBP complex from the circulation to tissue interstitial fluids was identical in both strains. Taken together, these data indicate that low circulating retinol-RBP levels in TTR− mice arise from increased renal filtration of the retinol-RBP complex.

RBP, which is synthesized and secreted primarily by hepatocytes, is the sole specific transport protein for retinol in the circulation (1Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

The secretion of RBP is strongly stimulated by its association with retinol, which alters the conformation of the protein (1Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2.

In blood, RBP is found as a 1:1 protein-protein complex with a 55-kDa serum protein, transthyretin (TTR) (1Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2.

Association with TTR is proposed both to facilitate RBP release from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (2Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1999; 139: 31-96Crossref Google Scholar) and to prevent renal filtration of RBP (1Goodman D.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2. Academic Press, Orlando1984: 41-88Google Scholar). Delivery of retinol to cells through the circulation by the RBP-TTR complex is the major pathway through which cells and tissues acquire retinol. It is generally accepted that cells and tissues acquire the retinoic acid they need for regulating gene expression via intracellular oxidation of this retinol to retinoic acid (3Blaner W.S.

These apparently contradictory observations raise two important questions for understanding the physiologic role(s) of TTR in living animals and the retinoid-related physiology of the TTR-deficient mice. The first of these is the basis of the low circulating retinol-RBP levels. Second, how do the tissues of TTR− mice acquire and maintain normal total retinol levels? We now report data that provide an answer for the first of these questions and some insight into the second. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Medium 199, Krebs buffer, penicillin/streptomycin, gentamicin, fetal bovine serum, and trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Collagenase type IV, collagen type I, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. Fatty acyl chlorides were obtained from Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). [3H]Retinol, [35S]methionine, and Na125I were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hexane, methanol, chloroform, methylene chloride, acetonitrile, and benzene, all of HPLC grade or grades of comparable purity, were purchased from Fisher. Authentic all-trans-retinol was a kind gift of Dr. Christian Eckhoff of Hoffmann-La Roche. All other chemicals and supplies were purchased from standard commercial suppliers. For our studies, we employed WT 129SV mice and mice lacking immunoreactive TTR (TTR− mice) from the same genetic background. These TTR− mice were created by targeted gene disruption in ES cells, as we have described previously (4Episkopou V. Maeda S. Nishiguchi S. Shimada K. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Robertson E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These ES cells were allowed to colonize blastocysts obtained from crosses of WT 129SV male and female mice. Thus, the inbred 129SV TTR− mice we used for our studies are from a homogeneous genetic background. Retinoid-related parameters of TTR-deficient mice from the 129SV strain have not been reported previously. We earlier have characterized TTR− mice from the outbred MF-1 genetic background (4Episkopou V. Maeda S. Nishiguchi S. Shimada K. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Robertson E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

All mice were maintained in a specific virus and pathogen free “barrier” facility prior to use in the studies. The animals were allowed ad libitum access to a standard rodent chow diet (Purina Products, Richmond, VA) and water. The room housing the mice was maintained on a standard 12-h light-dark cycle. For hepatocyte isolations, mouse livers were perfused in situthrough the portal vein at the rate of 10 ml/min, first with Krebs buffer (NaCl, 6.75 g/liter; NaHCO3, 2 g/liter; KCl, 0.345 g/liter; KH2PO4, 0.158 g/liter, MgSO4, 0.287 g/liter; gentamicin, 10 mg/liter; and glucose, 1.0 g/liter) for 4 min followed by medium 199 containing 0.25 mg/ml collagenase type IV and 10 ng/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 12 min. After perfusion, the liver, with the capsule intact, was quickly excised from the body cavity and transferred to a sterile Petri dish. After opening the capsule, the liver digest was resuspended in medium 199 and filtered through a fine nylon mesh to remove undigested materials. Hepatocytes were separated from nonparenchymal cells and debris by centrifugation at 20 × g for 3 min at room temperature. The hepatocyte-containing pellet was washed with DMEM containing glucose (4.5 g/liter), sodium pyruvate (0.110 g/liter), NaHCO3 (3.7 g/liter), penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (0.050 g/liter), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% fetal calf serum. Routinely, greater than 85% of the isolated cells excluded trypan blue. The yield of isolated mouse hepatocytes averaged ∼20 × 106 hepatocytes/g liver. Isolated hepatocytes were plated at 5 × 106 cells per 100-mm plastic dish in DMEM containing glucose (4.5 g/liter), sodium pyruvate (0.110 g/liter), NaHCO3 (3.7 g/liter), penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (0.050 g/liter), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% fetal calf serum. The plastic tissue culture dishes had been coated prior to hepatocyte plating with collagen type I, according to the supplier's instructions. This culture medium was changed for fresh medium after incubation for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. At this time, most hepatocytes have attached to the collagen-coated plates and have started to assume a flattened morphology. Hepatocyte cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air overnight prior to the start of an experiment. The hepatocytes isolated and maintained according to these procedures remained viable in culture for at least 3 days. At the start of our experiments to assess the effects of TTR deficiency on RBP synthesis and secretion, hepatocytes were washed three times with PBS and fresh DMEM containing glucose (4.5 g/liter), sodium pyruvate (0.110 g/liter), NaHCO3 (3.7 g/liter), penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (0.050 g/liter), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and supplemented with either 10% fetal calf serum, 5% TTR-deficient mouse serum, or 5% TTR-deficient mouse serum supplemented with 1 μg of human TTR per ml of medium placed over the cells. Hepatocytes were then cultured for 12 h to assess RBP synthesis and secretion. After removal of the medium, cultured hepatocytes were washed 3 times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. The media and cells were stored at −70 °C for up to 4 weeks prior to assay of media and cellular levels of RBP by radioimmunoassay. Three- to four-month-old female WT and TTR− mice were bilaterally nephrectomized to investigate the role of the kidney in maintaining retinol and RBP blood levels. Prior to nephrectomy, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketaset plus zylazine (0.2 ml/100 g body weight, 10 mg of ketaset, and 2 mg of zylazine/0.2 ml). Within 30 min after the start of surgery, the vessels leading to and from the kidneys had been fully ligated, and the kidneys were surgically removed, according to procedures described for rats (6Waynforth H.B. Flecknell P.A. Experimental and Surgical Technique in the Rat. Academic Press, Orlando1992: 274-275Google Scholar). Within 30 min after completion of this surgical procedure, mice regained consciousness, and they remained active throughout our studies. In trials of this surgical procedure, mice survived for periods up to at least 24 h after completion of the surgery. At 0, 6, 11, 15, and 18 h after the bilateral nephrectomy, 3–5 animals of each strain were sacrificed, and blood and liver were taken for analysis. Blood was collected through the caudal vein and allowed to clot at 4 °C. Both serum and the livers were immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C until analysis for retinol, mouse RBP, and mouse albumin. Animals used for measures at 0 h had undergone sham operations in which a ligature had been placed around the renal veins but was left untied. Human RBP used for our studies was purified to homogeneity from human serum by conventional column chromatography according to procedures we have described previously (7Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The homogeneously purified human RBP migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single protein band with an approximate mass of 21 kDa. The UV absorbance spectrum of this purified human RBP indicated that the RBP was ∼75% saturated with retinol (A325/A280 = 0.75). Consequently, we chose to add additional unlabeled retinol to the purified RBP to make the RBP fully saturated with retinol (7Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Unbound retinol was removed from the RBP solution through treatment of the RBP with charcoal/dextran (8Grippo J.F. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4492-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three-month-old male WT and TTR-deficient mice were fasted overnight. The next day, animals were anesthetized, and 0.1 ml of saline containing 10 μg of human holo-RBP was injected into the right jugular vein of each mouse. At 5, 10, 30, and 60 min and 6 h after injection, mice were bled through the caudal vein. Immediately after removal of a 0.4-ml aliquot of blood, the carcass was subjected to a total body perfusion with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl containing 0.5 mm EDTA flowing at 4.5 ml/min for 2–3 min. Based on the blanching of the liver and other organs, this perfusion removed residual blood from the organs. Following perfusion, liver, kidney, lung, heart, epididymal fat, perirenal fat, and skeletal muscle (both psoas and gastrocnemius muscle) were excised and immediately frozen in liquid N2. These tissues were stored at −70 °C prior to analysis for human and mouse RBP. Blood was allowed to clot at 4 °C, and the serum obtained was stored at −70 °C until RIA analysis for human and mouse RBP. Rat chylomicrons containing3H-labeled retinyl esters were prepared as described by Goodman et al. (9Goodman D.S. Huang H.S. Shiratori T. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 390-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) that had been fasted overnight were administered by gavage of 0.2 ml of a solution of corn oil + olive oil (1:1 v/v) containing 4 mg/ml α-tocopherol (Eastman Kodak Co.) and 40 μCi of [3H]retinol ([11,12-3H]retinol, 37.3 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to which 800 μg of unlabeled retinol (kindly provided by Dr. Christian Eckhoff, Hoffmann-La Roche) was added. Within 20 min after administration of the gavage, rats were anesthetized; the mesenteric lymph duct was cannulated, and chyle was collected on ice, under reduced light, into a sterile 15-ml tube containing 1 ml of a solution consisting of 1 mg of EDTA/ml saline (0.9% NaCl). Collection continued for periods up to 24 h. During chyle production, rats were provided free access to a solution of 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% KCl, and 5% glucose in water. To isolate chylomicrons, the chyle was overlaid with 0.05% EDTA in saline, pH 7.4, and was spun for 25 min at 100,000 × g and 18 °C. After centrifugation, chylomicrons were aspirated and stored at 4 °C in the dark for periods of up to 4 days prior to use in experiments. Chylomicron triglyceride concentrations were determined using a commercially available kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three-month-old male WT and TTR− mice were fasted overnight prior to injection with labeled chylomicrons. The next day, each animal was anesthetized, and 100 μl of rat chylomicrons containing 3 mg of triglyceride and trace [3H]retinyl ester (12 nmol, 0.2 μCi) was injected into the right jugular vein. Blood samples were obtained from the lateral tail vein at 5, 10, 30, and 60 min after chylomicron injection. Four animals of each strain were sacrificed 10 and 60 min after chylomicron injection. At the time of sacrifice, blood was taken, and a total body perfusion with ice-cold PBS was performed (as described above). The liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, brain, epididymal fat, and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) were excised and processed as described below for assessing [3H]retinoid uptake. To assess the levels of [3H]retinoids taken up by tissues from the labeled chylomicrons, tissues were homogenized in 4 volumes of 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) to give 20% (w/v) homogenates. The tissue homogenates were then extracted with 6 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v). After centrifugation and removal of the lower retinoid-containing chloroform phase, the upper phase was reextracted with 6 volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v). The lower chloroform phase from the reextracted tissue was taken and combined with the first chloroform extract in a 20-ml glass liquid scintillation vial and allowed to stand overnight in an ordinary laboratory fume hood. After the chloroform had evaporated, the retinoid-containing lipid film was dissolved in 20 ml of Hydrofluor liquid scintillation counting solution (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, Georgia). 3H counts/min were assayed in a Beckman LS 1800 LSC counter using a quench-correction program for calculation of3H disintegrations/min. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and d > 1.21 g/ml bottom fractions were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of serum obtained from wild type and TTR− mice as described by Bronzert and Brewer (10Bronzert T.J. Brewer Jr., H.B. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For isolation of these fractions, pools of mouse serum were employed. The serum pools were constructed by mixing 300 μl of serum obtained from 10 individual mice of the same strain, age, and sex. The total recovery of retinyl esters that been present in the serum pools when summed for the VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions ranged from 83 to 105%. Thus, essentially all of the retinyl ester present in the circulations of fasting WT and TTR− mice could be accounted for by that present in these three lipoprotein fractions. Serum retinol and liver total retinol (retinol + retinyl ester) concentrations were determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a procedure we have described previously (11Tsutsumi C. Okuno M. Tannous L. Piantedosi R. Allan M. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1805-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to an aliquot of serum (or liver homogenates) an equal volume of absolute ethanol containing a known amount of the internal standard retinyl acetate (Sigma) was added. Endogenous retinol and retinyl esters and the internal standard were extracted into hexane. After one backwash with H2O, the hexane extract was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of N2. Immediately upon reaching dryness, the retinoid containing film was redissolved in 40 μl of benzene for injection onto the HPLC. Retinol and retinyl esters were analyzed on a 4.6 × 250-mm 5-μm Beckmann Ultrasphere C18 column (Beckmann Instruments). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/methanol/dichloromethane (70:15:15 v/v) delivered at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. Retinoids were detected and quantitated by UV absorbance at 325 nm using a Waters PDA 996 photodiode array detector. Levels of mouse RBP in tissues and serum and isolated hepatocytes were analyzed using a sensitive and specific RIA procedure (12Blaner W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This procedure employs sheep anti-rat serum RBP antiserum and standards consisting of homogeneously purified rat serum RBP. Thus, all mouse RBP concentrations are reported as “rat equivalents.” This RIA has been used previously for the analysis of RBP in various mouse tissues and mouse serum (4Episkopou V. Maeda S. Nishiguchi S. Shimada K. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Robertson E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Wei S. Episkopou V.

Kukler A. van den Berg K.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1988; 68: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Purified human RBP and human serum give no displacement in the mouse RBP RIA. Thus, for some experiments where both human and mouse RBP are present in the sample tissue or serum sample, human RBP does not interfere with the accurate measure of mouse RBP levels. For some experiments, human RBP was injected into mice. Here, the concentrations of human RBP in tissues and serum were assessed by a sensitive and specific RIA for human RBP (12Blaner W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This RIA procedure makes use of polyclonal rabbit anti-human serum RBP antiserum and homogeneously purified human serum RBP as standard. Both purified rat serum RBP and mouse serum RBP do not give displacement in this RIA for human RBP. Consequently, the presence of mouse RBP in tissues and serum samples did not interfere with the accurate measure of tissue or serum human RBP levels. Albumin levels of mouse liver were assessed by RIA using rabbit anti-rat serum albumin antiserum and purified standards of rat albumin (12Blaner W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, mouse albumin concentrations are reported as rat equivalents. A modified Lowry procedure (14Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar) was used for determining protein levels of mouse liver homogenates. The reagents for this assay were purchased from Bio-Rad, and the assay was carried out according to the supplier's instructions. All data are expressed as means ± 1 S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's unpaired t test (two-tailed). Group differences were rejected as not significant for p > 0.05. These studies pursue questions raised upon the initial characterization of the phenotype of the TTR− mice. Specifically, what is the physiological mechanism(s) responsible for the low circulating retinol-RBP levels? For our present experiments, we used inbred 129SV WT and TTR− mice, whereas we had earlier characterized the TTR− phenotype in outbred MF-1 mice (4Episkopou V. Maeda S. Nishiguchi S. Shimada K. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Robertson E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,5Wei S. Episkopou V. Piantedosi R. Maeda S. Shimada K. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To link the two studies, we compared various biochemical consequences of the TTR− mutation in the two genetic backgrounds. As was the case for outbred MF-1 TTR− mice, serum retinol and RBP levels in TTR− mice in the 129SV genetic background were very low. For both mouse strains, serum retinol and RBP levels in TTR deficiency were ∼5% of those observed for age- and sex-matched WT mice. Thus, in this regard, genetic background does not influence the severity of the TTR− phenotype. Liver total retinol (retinol + retinyl ester) and RBP levels for outbred and inbred WT and TTR− mice are shown in TableI. Hepatic total retinol levels in WT and TTR− male mice, whether outbred or inbred, were not statistically different (5Wei S. Episkopou V. Piantedosi R. Maeda S. Shimada K. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, female TTR−mice from both strains had significantly higher hepatic total retinol concentrations than the corresponding WT controls. Since all of the mice were maintained on the same chow diet, it is unlikely that dietary intake accounts for this difference. Hepatic RBP levels for both male and female 129SV TTR− mice were ∼3–4-fold greater than those of age- and sex-matched WT controls, whereas the difference in the MF-1 background was only 1.6-fold (Table I (5Wei S. Episkopou V. Piantedosi R. Maeda S. Shimada K. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)). Nevertheless, although genetic background does quantitatively influence the TTR− phenotype with regards to hepatic RBP levels, the qualitative effects of TTR deficiency on serum and liver levels of retinol and RBP are similar for outbred MF-1 and inbred 129SV TTR-deficient mice.Table ILiver total retinol and RBP levels for 3-month-old inbred 129SV and outbred MF-1 wild type and TTR − miceStrainn 1-aThe n indicates the number of mice used for measurement of each parameter.RetinolRBP1-bPurified rat serum RBP was used as the standard in the RIA for mouse RBP; thus, the mouse RBP concentrations represent “μg of rat RBP equivalents.”μg retinol eq/g wet weightμg/g wet weight129SV Male, TTR−7443 ± 24738.0 ± 5.61-cSignificantly different at the 1% level of significance from the level in WT mice of the same strain and sex.

Positive control of cys genes requires the presence of the inducer N-acetylserine. Following random and site-directed mutagenesis of the cysBgene, 20 CysB variants were isolated. Six single amino acid substitutions within the N terminus of CysB abolished the DNA-binding ability of the protein. Seven mutations in the central region of CysB affected its response to the inducer. Four of these CysB mutants retained repressing activity, but lost their activating functionin vivo.

The electrophoretic mobility of the complex formed by one of the CysBc variants with thecysP promoter suggested a dimeric state of this protein.

LysR-type transcriptional regulators helix-turn-helix base pair(s) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside polymerase chain reaction wild-type electrophoretic mobility shift assay LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs),1 initially reported by Henikoff et al. (1Henikoff S.G. Haughn J.M. Calvo J.M. Wallace J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6602-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), compose probably the largest family of prokaryotic regulatory proteins. Since the last systematic review (2Schell M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), in which some 50 LTTRs were mentioned, the family has expanded to over 100 members identified in diverse bacterial genera. InEscherichia coli K12, the overall repertoire of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators, estimated as 314 proteins (3Perez-Rueda E. Collado-Vides J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), includes 45 LTTRs (18 known and 27 predicted). All LTTRs investigated so far are DNA-binding proteins that positively regulate transcription of target genes, and most of them also repress their own expression. The common family features are the similar size of the molecule (between 300 and 350 amino acids), the formation of either homodimers or homotetramers, the presence of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in the N-terminal region, and the requirement for a small molecule that acts as coinducer (2Schell M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The homology between LTTRs is generally high, suggesting their evolution from a common distant ancestor and the possibility of their similar tertiary structure. The highest sequence similarity exists within the 66 N-terminal amino acids, containing a HTH motif and proposed to function as a DNA-binding domain. The central region of the LysR-type proteins shows the lowest sequence homology between family members. Mutational studies performed on some proteins suggest that two subdomains of this region (amino acids 95–173 and 196–206) can be engaged in coinducer recognition/response (2Schell M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 4Kullik I. Toledano M.B. Tartaglia L.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cebolla A.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4397-4403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regions involved in multimerization of LTTRs are not well defined. Some experimental results obtained for NahR (7Schell M.A. Brown P.H. Raju S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3844-3850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AmpR (8Bartowsky E. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and OxyR (9Kullik I. Stevens J. Toledano M.B. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate involvement of the C-terminal domain in oligomer formation. Several LysR-type proteins, including CysB, have been suggested to interact with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α-subunit (10Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, no study has clarified the details of the putative contact(s) of any LTTR with the RNA polymerase. Structural characterization of LysR-type proteins has been delayed by the fact that many of the family members are insoluble when overexpressed and difficult to obtain in highly purified form. CysB, a LysR family member, is an essential positive factor for activity of most cys genes engaged in the assimilatory sulfate pathway via cysteine biosynthesis (see Ref. 11Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 514-527Google Scholar for a review). High-level expression of these genes, composing the cysteine regulon, requires, in addition to CysB, the presence of an inducer (N-acetyl-l-serine) and sulfur limitation. CysB acts also as a repressor of its own gene (12Jagura-Burdzy G. Hulanicka D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 744-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ostrowski J. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2212-2218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interactions of CysB with responsive promoter regions are unusually complex (11Kredich N.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

DNA regions identified as “CysB-binding sites” show poor sequence homology. In general, they share a configuration of imperfect dyad symmetry between 19-bp half-sites, but the number, spacing, and arrangement of half-sites vary in particular promoters. Wild-type CysB is a tetramer of identical 36-kDa subunits in solution (15Miller B.E. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6006-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it also binds to DNA as a tetramer (16Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3673-3682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In positively regulated promoters (i.e. cysK and cysP), CysB binds in the absence of inducer and occupies a large DNA region including three half-sites (16Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J.

This mode of DNA-protein interaction results in DNA bending by ∼100o and is unfavorable for transcriptional activation of the promoter. N-Acetylserine is thought to induce a conformational change in CysB; this change allows the protein to interact preferentially with “activatory sites,” composed of two half-sites spaced by 1–2 bp and localized just upstream of the −35 regions of the cysJ,cysK, and cysP promoters. The stable interaction of the CysB tetramer with a unique activatory site is critical for transcriptional activation of the promoter, and it may be required for RNA polymerase recruitment. In the cysB promoter, CysB protects the DNA region overlapping the RNA polymerase-binding site that results in repression of transcription (13Ostrowski J. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2212-2218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, acetylserine reduces binding of CysB to DNA, thereby releasing the repression of the cysB gene. Sulfur limitation required for high-level expression of cys genes in vivocan be explained by the fact that sulfide and thiosulfate act as anti-inducers, competing with N-acetylserine for the CysB activator (18Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5876-5886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ostrowki J. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 779-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cysteine is an inhibitor of serine transacetylase, the enzyme required for acetylserine biosynthesis. CysB is an attractive representative of LTTRs to study the structure/function relationship for several reasons. First, the molecular basis of the interaction of CysB with cys gene promoters, including DNA bending and inducer response, is relatively well understood. This offers the tool for in vitrocomparisons of properties of CysB mutants versus the wild-type protein. Second, the CysB protein is so far the only family member whose cofactor-binding domain (amino acids 88–324) has been crystallized and subjected to three-dimensional analysis (20Tyrrell R. Verschueren K.H.G. Dodson E.J. Murshudov G.N. Addy C. Wilkinson A.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1017-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The structure of the dimer formed by CysB monomer fragments (amino acids 88–324) has shed some light on protein surfaces composing an inducer- and anti-inducer-binding cavity. However, the structure lacking the 87 N-terminal amino acids provide little information about the overall organization of the native tetrameric protein. Third, in some promoters of E. coli, including the tau promoter (21van der Ploeg J. Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. Hryniewicz M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7671-7678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ssu promoter (22van der Ploeg J. Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Bykowski T. Hryniewicz M.M. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29358-29365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), CysB acts in conjunction with another LysR-type activator, Cbl, which itself is highly homologous to CysB (23Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Hryniewicz M.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of cooperation of these two proteins is not yet understood. A systematic mutational analysis of CysB might give further insight into the structure of this protein and related LysR family members and provide a valuable complement to the information gained from physicochemical studies. Here we describe the properties of several CysB variants resulting from single amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal and central regions of the protein as well as those resulting from C-terminal truncations. On the basis of the effects of these mutations on the repressing and activating functions of CysBin vivo and the DNA binding characteristics of selected CysB mutants in vitro, we discuss regions of the protein involved in DNA binding, inducer response, oligomerization, and possible RNA polymerase recruitment. The E. coli strains and basic plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. All strains were grown at 37 °C in either LB medium or sulfur-free minimal medium (24van der Ploeg J.R. Weiss M.A. Saller E. Nashimoto H. Saito N. Kertesz M.A. Leisinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5438-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose (0.2%), tryptophan (4 μg/ml), and a sulfur source. Sulfate (0.5 mm) was used as a sulfur source in solid media, andl-djenkolic acid (1 mm) served as non-repressing sulfur source in liquid media for β-galactosidase assays. When required, the growth media contained ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), or kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The solid media (LB agar with X-gal or MacConkey/lactose agar) were used for selection of transformants of the desired phenotype.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidRelevant genotype and characteristicsRef. or sourceE. coli strains DH5αsupE44ΔlacU169(φ80lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1Laboratory collection NK1trpE5 leu-6 thi hsdR hsdM+cysBN.

Details for construction of plasmids carrying cysB genes with point mutations and 3′-terminal truncations are described under “Materials and Methods.” Relevant cysB mutants investigated in this study are listed in Table II. Plasmid DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, and transformation were performed according to published procedures (25Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. E., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified with QIAGEN midi-columns. Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, andTaq polymerase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Promega and were used according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The dideoxy chain termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) was used to sequence the cysB region from plasmid templates. Most sequences were obtained using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer, and some plasmids were sequenced manually using a sequencing kit and α-35S-dATP (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Deletion within thecysB gene was created by excision of the 821-bpNruI/HpaI fragment encompassing the promoter region and 216 codons of the cysB open reading frame (see Fig. 1) from plasmid pMH148, containing the 2.8-kilobase pairEcoRI/EcoRV fragment of pJOH2 cloned in pUC18EcoRI/HincII. The deletion was tagged by insertion of a Kanr cassette excised from pUC4KIXX as a 1.35-kilobase SmaI fragment. The resulting plasmid, pMH161, was linearized and transformed into E. coli JC7623. Kanr Aps transformants were selected, and correct replacement of the cysB gene in the genomic DNA was confirmed by PCR analysis. The ΔcysB::kan mutation was transferred to other E. coli strains (see Table I) by P1-mediated transduction. The 3′-coordinates indicated for all cysB-specific oligonucleotides used in this study are consistent with those of the published cysB sequence (27Ostrowski J. Jagura-Burdzy G. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5999-6005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where +1 indicates A in the ATG start codon. Nucleotides that had been changed to create restriction sites, stop codons, or specific mutations are shown in boldface. Primers ECCB3 (CCCAAGCTTTTTTTCTTCACACCTATACA-3′, −123) and ECCB4 (CATGCATGCGGTAATTAGACACTACTT-3′, +1101, complementary strand) were used for PCR amplification of the wild-type E. coli cysB gene from the pJOH1 plasmid. The fragment obtained was cleaved with HindIII/SphI and inserted into pBR322 HindIII/SphI to give plasmid pMH147. Plasmids pMH189, pMH191, pMH193, pMH195, pMH222, pMH223, pMH224, pMH225, pMH226, pMH228, and pMH229 are derivatives of pMH147 obtained by random mutagenesis and contain point mutations within cysB (see Table II). Plasmids pMH190, pMH192, pMH194, pMH196, and pMH197 were obtained from pMH189, pMH191, pMH193, pMH195, and pMH147, respectively, by excision of theHindIII/SphI fragments (containing thecysB region) and their insertion intoHindIII/SphI-cleaved pACYC184. Primers ECCB8 (GGAATTCTAAGTGGATGGTTTAACA-3′, +1) and ECCB9 (AAACTGCAGGCGGTAATTAGACAC-3′, +1106, complementary strand) served to amplify the promoterless cysB gene on the pJOH1 template, and the PCR product was cleaved withEcoRI/PstI and placed under the ptrc promoter in pTrc99A cleaved with EcoRI/PstI to give plasmid pMH199. Plasmid pMH199 served for overproduction of WT CysB. To overproduce CysB mutant proteins, plasmids pMH200, pMH201, pMH202, pMH203, and pMH205 were obtained by replacement of the 653-bpSmaI/BamHI fragment (see Fig. 1) of pMH199 with the SmaI/BamHI fragments excised from plasmids pMH189, pMH191, pMH193, pMAH01, and pMAH2, respectively. To construct C-terminally truncated CysB variants, oligonucleotide ECCB13 (TTACGTCCGGTTAGGGC-3′, +712) was used as an upper primer, and oligonucleotides ECCB14 (AAACTGCAGTTATTAATCAACGACATCACGCGT-3′, +886, complementary strand), ECCB15 (AAACTGCAGTTAAGAGCGCAATGCGAC-3′, +910, complementary strand), and ECCB16 (AAACTGCAGTTATATATCTTTAAACATG-3′, +942, complementary strand) were used as lower primers for PCR amplification of 3′-terminal fragments of cysB from the pJOH1 template. The PCR fragments were cleaved with BamHI-PstI and ligated with the pMH199 fragment obtained by excision of the 3′-portion of the WTcysB region (as a 377-bp BamHI/PstI fragment) to give plasmids pMH214, pMH215, and pMH217 (serving for overproduction of the corresponding CysB mutant proteins). Plasmids pMH231, pMH232, and pMH233 were obtained by replacement of theBamHI/SphI fragment of pMH147 (containing the 3′-portion of WT cysB) with theBamHI/SphI fragments excised from pMH214, pMH217, and pMH215, respectively. Other plasmids carrying truncatedcysB (pMH218, pMH219, and pMH230) were obtained as follows. The BamHI/PstI fragment of pMH199 (containing the 3′-portion of WT cysB) was inserted into pUC19, and the insert was amplified by PCR with pUC-specific forward and reverse primers under mutagenic conditions (28Grob P. Kahn D. Guiney D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5398-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI/SphI and ligated with pMH147 devoid of the corresponding BamHI/SphI region. The ligation mixture was transformed into the EC2549 strain, and the transformants unable to grow on minimal sulfate plates were selected (3 of ∼2000) and used to recover the corresponding plasmids. Mutations resulting in C-terminal truncations of CysB are listed in Table II. To introduce the Y27G substitution into CysB, primers ECCB8 and ECCB19 (GATCCCGGGTTGTGAGGTACCAAGTCCTTCCGC-3′, +67, complementary strand) were used for PCR amplification of DNA fragment from the pJOH1 template. The fragment obtained was cleaved withEcoRI/SmaI and used to replace the corresponding 113-bp EcoRI/SmaI fragment (see Fig. 1) of pMH199 to give plasmid pMH235. Plasmid pMH303, containing the translational fusion cysB′::′lacZ, was constructed as follows. The 450-bp BamHI/SmaI fragment (see Fig.1), containing the cysB promoter and 30 codons of thecysB open reading frame, was excised from pJOH1 and inserted into pUC18 BamHI/HincII. The cysBregion was recovered as a BamHI/PstI fragment and inserted into pNM482 cleaved with BamHI/PstI to give pMH302. The cysB′::′lacZ region was excised from pMH302 as a 5.5-kilobaseEcoRI/StuI fragment and cloned in the low-copy vector pHSG576 cleaved with EcoRI/SmaI to give pMH303. Primers ECCB3 and ECCB11 (GTGCTTGCCGCTTCGGGA-3′, +148, complementary strand) served to amplify the cysB promoter fragment from the pJOH1 template for DNA binding assays.Table IISummary of characteristics of cysB mutantsPlasmid 2-aAll plasmids listed are derivatives of pBR322, with the exception of pMH235, which is a derivative of pTrc99A.cysBon plasmidCys phenotype 2-bShown are the effects of plasmids carrying cysB with the indicated mutations on growth of strains (ΔcysB, cysB (point mutation in chromosomalcysB), or WT on minimal plates with sulfate: +, full growth; −, no growth; ±, abortive growth.β-Galactosidase activity 2-cEach value represents a mean of at least three different experiments and is shown as percent of β-galactosidase level relative to the control values: EC2549/pMH303 (100% = 2544 Miller units), EC1250/pMH303 (100% = 1000 Miller units), EC2559/pMH147 (100% = 225 Miller units), and EC2266/pMH147 (100% = 241 Miller units).MutationAmino acid exchangeΔcysB EC2549cysBEC2275WT EC1250cysB′::′lacZ (plasmid pMH303)cysPT′::lacZ(chromosomal)ΔcysB EC2549WT EC1250ΔcysB EC2559cysB EC2266None−−+100.01003.35.2pMH147None (WT)None+++4.314100.0100.0pMH189GCC → GTCA244V−−−5.618 ND 2-dND, not determined.2.5pMH191GCG → GAGA247E−−−3.012ND5.7pMH193ACA → ATAT196I−−−4.318ND6.5pMH195ATG → ATAM160I−−−2.621ND7.8pMH222GAG → AAGE11K−−−86.0268ND8.4pMH223TCA → TTAS20L−−−80.0238ND3.2pMH224ACA → ATAT22I−−−86.0228ND5.8pMH225ATT → ACTI48T−−+71.0102ND6.5pMH226CAA → TAAQ5Ter 2-eTer indicates termination codon.−−+92.0114ND7.8pMH228CTA → CGAL44R−−+73.0108ND6.8pMH229GAA → AAAE41K−−+63.094ND7.0pMH232AAA → TAAK320Ter+++10.0ND94.097.3pMH233AAT → TAAN309Ter−++58.01673.3NDpMH219TTG → TAGL306Ter−±+102.07126.6NDpMH231GCG → TAAA302Ter−±+82.09310.7NDpMH230GAT → GCGD298A−±+97.0957.1NDGTC → TGAV299TerpMH218TTA → TAAL295Ter−±+96.0988.1NDpMH235TAC → GGTY27G−−+2.2ND8.0NDACA → ACCT28TpMAH01GCT → GATA227D+++2.2ND86.294.0pMAH2TAC → AACY164N+++3.4ND110.098.0pMAH3TAT → TCTY197S+++4.7NDND79.02-a All plasmids listed are derivatives of pBR322, with the exception of pMH235, which is a derivative of pTrc99A.2-b Shown are the effects of plasmids carrying cysB with the indicated mutations on growth of strains (ΔcysB, cysB (point mutation in chromosomalcysB), or WT on minimal plates with sulfate: +, full growth; −, no growth; ±, abortive growth.2-c Each value represents a mean of at least three different experiments and is shown as percent of β-galactosidase level relative to the control values: EC2549/pMH303 (100% = 2544 Miller units), EC1250/pMH303 (100% = 1000 Miller units), EC2559/pMH147 (100% = 225 Miller units), and EC2266/pMH147 (100% = 241 Miller units).2-d ND, not determined.2-e Ter indicates termination codon. Open table in a new tab Primers ECCP1 (ATTGATGGCGGCAGCACACT) and ECCP2 (GACCAGCGCGAGTGAGTTCT, complementary strand) were used to amplify the cysP promoter region (from positions −321 to +72 relative to the transcription start site) from the pMH1822 template. Mutagenesis with hydroxylamine was carried out essentially as described (29Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 314-317Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 μg of purified pMH147 was mixed with 50 μl of solution containing freshly prepared 1 m hydroxylamine, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) and incubated at 75 °C for 45 min. The samples were dialyzed extensively against Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7.6), and DNA was precipitated with ethanol and used to transform the EC2266 strain. Plasmid pMH147 was also used to transform the E. coli mutator strainmutD5. The transformants obtained were rinsed off the plates, and the plasmid DNA was re-isolated and used to transform the EC2266 strain. Transformants were screened for the desired phenotype on LB agar plates containing X-gal or on MacConkey/lactose agar plates. β-Galactosidase activities were assayed in cells taken from mid-log phase cultures grown on minimal medium withl-djenkolic acid as a derepressing sulfur source according to the method of Miller (30Miller, J. H. (ed) (1992) A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics, pp. 268-274, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar) with o-nitrophenyl galactoside as a substrate. Duplicate assays were performed for each culture and were repeated at least three times. E. coli extracts were prepared from strain DH5α containing plasmid pMH199 (WT cysB) or plasmids (derivatives of pTrc99A) encoding mutant alleles of cysB. Transformed cells were grown on LB/ampicillin, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (0.5 mm final concentration) in the early exponential phase (A 600 = 0.15). Growth was continued for a further 2 h, and cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm disodium EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell suspensions were sonicated on ice, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were fractionated by streptomycin sulfate precipitation and ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously (15Miller B.E. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6006-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fractions precipitated with ammonium sulfate (229 mg/ml) were dissolved in buffer A. All preparations in which the CysB protein was successfully overproduced served as a source of CysB proteins in DNA binding experiments. Highly purified CysB protein fromSalmonella typhimurium (obtained from N. M. Kredich) was used as a reference for the E. coli WT CysB preparation in DNA binding and transcription runoff experiments. DNA fragments containing thecysP and cysB promoter regions were generated by PCR (see “Oligonucleotides and Plasmid Construction”), 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), and purified with QIAquick spin columns (QIAGEN). Conditions for binding reactions and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were essentially as described (17Monroe R.S. Ostrowski J. Hryniewicz M.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6919-6929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained ∼10 ng of labeled DNA fragment and 50 ng of sonicated calf thymus DNA (to reduce nonspecific binding) in CysB buffer consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Incubation (5 min at 37 °C) was initiated by including a given amount of CysB preparation and O-acetyl-l-serine where indicated. Samples were separated on 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (82:1) vertical gels in 0.05 m Tris borate/EDTA buffer (pH 8.3) for 1.5 h at 10 V/cm, and the radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography.

This down-regulates activity and increases enzyme Km,O2. To understand this process, we developed a 10-step kinetic model in which the ferric heme-NO enzyme forms as the immediate product of catalysis, and then partitions between NO dissociation versus reduction to a ferrous heme-NO complex. Rate constants used for the model were derived from recent literature or were determined here. Computer simulations of the model precisely described both pre-steady and steady-state features of nNOS catalysis, including NADPH consumption and NO production, buildup of a heme-NO complex, changes between pre-steady and steady-state rates, and the change in enzyme Km,O2 in the presence or absence of NO synthesis. The model also correctly simulated the catalytic features of nNOS mutants W409F and W409Y, which are hyperactive and display less heme-NO complex formation in the steady state. Model simulations showed how the rate of heme reduction influences several features of nNOS catalysis, including populations of NO-bound versus NO-free enzyme in the steady state and the rate of NO synthesis. The simulation predicts that there is an optimum rate of heme reduction that is close to the measured rate in nNOS. Ratio between NADPH consumption and NO synthesis is also predicted to increase with faster heme reduction. Our kinetic model is an accurate and versatile tool for understanding catalytic behavior and will provide new perspectives on NOS regulation.

The counterpart to this diversity of localization and function is a specific regulation of each isoform. In this regard, nNOS appears unique because it is the only isoform for which a rapid (within seconds) and stable buildup of a ferrous heme-NO complex has been observed (14Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L.

During steady-state catalysis, a majority of nNOS (up to 80%) is present as its ferrous heme-NO complex. Buildup of this complex is linked to a decrease in catalytic activity. Moreover, it induces a significant increase in the apparent Km,O2 of the enzyme (14Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which has important implications regarding function in cells or tissues (24Dweik R.A. Laskowski D.

The model incorporates our recent finding that a ferric heme-NO complex is generated prior to release of free NO (26Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This ferric heme-NO product partitions between two pathways to regenerate ferric enzyme, but only one of these pathways efficiently releases NO. The kinetic model is shown to simulate correctly behaviors of wild-type nNOS or nNOS mutants that display greater activity in the steady state (22Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.C. Tainer J, A.

The general utility of the model in visualizing the effect of enzyme modifications and in understanding the different catalytic behaviors of the three NOS isoforms is discussed.DISCUSSIONWe developed a kinetic model to understand the unique behavior of nNOS. This involves a fast buildup of ferrous-NO complex includes about 80% of the steady-state population, with an associated change between initial and steady-state activities. In the past we proposed models for nNOS partitioning which typically invoked direct competition between NO and O2 binding to ferrous heme (15Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of the earlier models when simulated were able to mimic closely the behavior of nNOS, and the competition binding concept eventually did not fit well with relative rates of heme reduction and ligand binding that were determined later. Our current model integrates the latest results in the literature, particularly the concept of fast recombination between ferric heme and NO formed in the active site (26Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,30Scheele J.S. Bruner E. Kharitonov V.G. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Sharma V.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13105-13110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Simulations of our kinetic model closely mimic all catalytic features of wild-type or mutant nNOS, including their initial and steady-state behaviors, populations of heme species, and apparent Km,O2 values. Together, this strongly argues that the fundamental features of our current model are correct.In our model catalytic turnover is regulated by the following two distinct features: 1) partitioning of an immediate Fe(III) heme-NO product between a futile and productive regenerating pathway, and 2) the relative rate of the futile regenerating pathway. These two features share no common influences and thus operate completely independent of one another. Partitioning simply reflects the relative rates of NO dissociation versus reduction of the immediate Fe(III) heme-NO product. Because these are fundamental characteristics of the enzyme, they are immune to the external environment when the enzyme operates under Vmax conditions (i.e. sufficient NADPH, Arg, etc.). However, because they oppose each other, small changes in these two rates can have a relatively large effect on enzyme partitioning. For our model we assumed that reduction of the Fe(III) heme-NO complex was identical to reduction of the ferric enzyme, whose extent and rate is known (40Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5451-5454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,41Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because NO binding to hemeproteins typically raises their midpoint potential (55Andersen J.F. Ding X.D. Balfour C. Shokireva T.K. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10118-10131Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the assumption is probably valid at least from a thermodynamic standpoint. The accuracy of our model in simulating several aspects of nNOS catalytic behavior also supports the assumption. Nevertheless, a direct measure of this rate may enable finer refinement. In contrast to the partitioning step, the rate of the futile regenerating cycle is clearly influenced by factors that are both extrinsic and intrinsic to the enzyme. For example, the rate of Fe(II) heme-NO oxidation is directly related to the O2concentration, and enzyme mutations at residue Trp-409 greatly increase the rate at any given O2 concentration. Given the multiple opportunities for “fine-tuning” both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, our kinetic model should be useful to guide and interpret further investigation of catalysis and regulation.One imagines that intrinsic parameters of nNOS have been set for its proper physiologic function. This may be illustrated by its measured rate of heme reduction corresponding to the activity optimum predicted in our model (see Fig. 5 B). Intrinsic parameters can also govern the relative impact of extrinsic factors such as O2concentration. This is illustrated by the high apparent Km,O2 that is unique to nNOS (14Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 56Rengasamy A. Johns R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 30-33PubMed Google Scholar). Our model reveals that a relatively fast heme reduction, coupled with a relatively slow cycling through the futile pathway, creates this special regulation in nNOS. Functionally, this allows the enzyme to minimize its catalytic sensitivity to O2concentration changes, while generating NO in a near-linear manner as a function of O2 concentration. Why this evolved is still unclear (14Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it must be physiologically important, because our model clearly shows that the enzyme sacrifices catalytic efficiency to create this response.For iNOS (17Assreuy J. Cumha F.Q. Liew F.Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), a loss of activity occurs if heme binds NO that accumulates in solution. However, this occurs only when relatively high NO concentrations are achieved, can be prevented by NO scavenging, and involves trapping the heme in a ferric NO complex. It is important to stress that this phenomenon corresponds to a simple equilibrium between ferric heme and free NO and is therefore quite different from the kind of regulation described in this report. This phenomenon occurs quite late during NO synthesis (15 min at 37 °C) and therefore was not taken into account by our model that focused on initial and steady-state phases.Negrerie and colleagues (29Negrerie M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24694-24702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), who thoroughly studied the NO recombination process in eNOS, suggested on the basis of results by Abu-Soud et al.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that the Fe(II) heme-NO species may form via reduction of the Fe(III) heme-NO species. However, the Fe(II) heme-NO species is not observed during steady-state catalysis in eNOS or iNOS. At this point, our model can provide an explanation for this difference. eNOS is distinguished by a low steady-state activity, a slow heme reduction, and an undetectable level of Fe(II) heme-NO species (19Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Its low catalytic activity is therefore not linked to eNOS cycling through the futile regenerating pathway. In fact, according to our simulations, the slow heme reduction rate in eNOS (19Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,58Miller R.T. Martasek P. Omura T. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This suggests that eNOS follows the same kinetic model as nNOS, but the slower heme reduction minimizes partitioning into the futile regenerating cycle and diminishes the global speed of catalysis. In iNOS, one observes a similar catalytic activity and a slightly slower heme reduction rate compared with nNOS (19Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 60Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de La Garza M.A. Kim J.J. Masters B.S. J. Biol.

M. Abu-Soud and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results). This phenotype is similar to what is seen for the Trp-409 nNOS mutants. Indeed, our preliminary data suggest that iNOS exhibits accelerated Fe(II) heme-NO oxidation, 5J. Santolini and D. J. Stuehr, manuscript in preparation. as occurs in the Trp-409 nNOS mutants (23Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and this can account for such results. Thus, although several kinetic parameters remain to be determined for iNOS and eNOS, our kinetic model seems capable of simulating their behavior as well.So far, the different behaviors of the three NOS isoforms appear to be linked to differences in their heme reduction and Fe(II) heme-NO oxidation rates. But what structural and physical parameters control these processes? The Trp-409 mutations achieved by Adak et al. (22Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.C. Tainer J, A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggest one controlling factor is the heme reduction potential. Crystal structures show that a Trp-409 indole nitrogen forms a strong hydrogen bond with the heme thiolate (61Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Gachhui R. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J.

Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Suppression of this hydrogen bond through mutation is expected to lower the reduction potential of the heme, which we suspect inhibits heme reduction while speeding oxidation of the Fe(II) heme-NO complex. This hypothesis also arises from the comparison of the results of Wang et al.(51Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), who observed a faster rate of Fe(II) heme-NO complex oxidation in the absence of Arg, and Presta et al. (63Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), who showed that Arg binding increases the reduction potential of the NOS heme. Consequently, it seems possible that catalytic differences among NOS isoforms arise in part from their differential control of heme reduction potential. Our kinetic model provides a basis to investigate this hypothesis and better understand the structure-function relationships in the three NOS. Nitric oxide (NO)1 helps mediate a large number of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes (1Lincoln J. Hoyle C.H.V. Burnstock G. Nitric Oxide in Health and Disease.

RFC1 also delivers MTX and new generation antifolates into a variety of tumors, particularly those of hematopoietic origin (4Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 11-23PubMed Google Scholar). RFC1 exchanges folates with a broad spectrum of inorganic and organic anions, and high extracellular concentrations of a variety of organic phosphates competitively inhibit RFC1-mediated folate influx (5Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 6Yang C.-H. Sirotnak F.M. Dembo M. J. Membr.

This interaction between RFC1 and organic phosphates results in the uphill transport of folates into cells linked to the organic phosphate gradient across cell membranes (5Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Structurally unrelated to the folates, thiamin plays an essential role in glycolysis and oxidative decarboxylation reactions after conversion to the coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate by thiamin pyrophosphokinase in cells. Thiamin is also transported across cell membranes by a carrier-mediated process (8Rindi G. Laforenza U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thiamin deficiency, reflected in a decrease in plasma thiamin concentration and TPP levels in erythrocytes, results in a variety of clinical abnormalities including cardiovascular and neurological disorders (9Kril J.J. Metab. Brain Dis. 1996; 11: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thiamin deficiency due to impaired transport results in the thiamin-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome, a disorder also associated with deafness and diabetes mellitus (10Mandel H. Berant M.

Positional cloning with families inheriting this autosomal recessive disease led to the recent identification of the thiamin transporter gene SLC19A2 (12Labay V. Raz T. Baron D. Mandel H. Williams H.

The thiamin transporter encoded by SLC19A2 is highly homologous to RFC1, sharing an amino acid identity of 40% and similarity of 55%, and both are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains. Despite the similarity between these two proteins, the thiamin transporter, when expressed in HeLa cells, was not found to transport folates (15Dutta B. Huang W. Molero M. Kekuda R. Leibach F.H.

In the current report, the impact of RFC1 function on thiamin transport and accumulation of its active coenzyme metabolites was studied in murine leukemia cells. Although RFC1 was not found to transport thiamin, it does transport phosphorylated thiamin derivatives, thereby modulating the intracellular accumulation of active thiamin metabolites. [3′,5′,7-3H]MTX (5.7 Ci/mmol) and [3H]thiamin hydrochloride (20 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [3H]TPP (generally labeled, 4.2 Ci/mmol) was custom-made by Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Unlabeled MTX was provided by Lederle Laboratories (Carolina, Puerto Rico), and thiamin, TMP, and TPP were purchased from Sigma. Tritiated MTX was purified by high performance liquid chromatography before use (16Fry D.W. Yalowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tritiated thiamin and TPP were used directly after purity was confirmed by HPLC. G1a, G2, D10, and MTXrA cells were selected from murine leukemia L1210 cells in the presence of MTX, with or without chemical mutagenesis, as previously reported (17Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D.

All four cell lines harbor mutations in RFC1 resulting in impaired or absent transport mediated by RFC1. Both R16 and T2 are cell lines with high level expression of RFC1, obtained by transfecting murine RFC1 cDNA into MTXrA or wild-type L1210 cells, respectively (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E.

L7, L15, L44, and L51 are 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate-resistant L1210 variants isolated by chemical mutagenesis followed by selection in the presence of this drug. In these cell lines folylpolyglutamate synthetase was mutated, resulting in a marked reduction in activity of the protein, but RFC1 function was not altered (23Zhao R. Titus S. Gao F. Moran R.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26599-26606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% bovine calf serum (HyClone), 2 mmglutamine, 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For assay of thiamin accumulation, cells were grown in thiamin-free RPMI medium (custom-made by Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% dialyzed bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, 20 μm2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) supplemented with 30 nm tritiated thiamin. For culture of R16 and T2 cells, G418 at a concentration of 750 μg/ml was included in the medium to ensure stable, high level expression of RFC1. Cells were harvested, washed twice with HBS (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4), and resuspended in HBS to 1.5 × 107 cells/ml. For some experiments, glucose-free HBS was also used. Cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min following which uptake was initiated by the addition of [3H]thiamin, [3H]TPP, or [3H]MTX, and samples were taken at the indicated times. Uptake was terminated by injection of 1 ml of the cell suspension into 10 ml of ice-cold HBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold HBS, dried, and digested with 1 n NaOH in an 8-ml vial. After fluor was added, radioactivity was assessed in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. For efflux experiments, cells loaded with 0.2 μm[3H]thiamin for 1 h, were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold HBS, and resuspended into 9 ml of pre-warmed thiamin-free HBS. Portions were taken, and intracellular tritium was determined as described as above. Cells (∼ 8 × 106) incubated with [3H]thiamin were washed three times with 0 °C HBS. One-fourth of the cell pellet was processed for dry weight and total tritium as described in transport studies. The remaining portion was processed according to a slightly modified published protocol (24Matsuda T. Cooper J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were suspended in 250 μl of HBS, and 15 μl of trichloroacetic acid (100% w/v) was added to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation the supernatant was extracted with 0.5 ml of water-saturated ether for five times and neutralized with 1n NaOH. After the residual ether was removed in a speed-vac, the extract was spiked with unlabeled thiamin, TMP, and TPP and separated on a reversed-phase HPLC column (Waters Spherisorb, 5 μm ODS2 4.6 × 250 mm) as described previously (25Barile M. Valenti D. Brizio C. Quagliariello E. Passarella S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Separation of the thiamin, TMP, and TPP was achieved with a linear gradient of from 0 to 60% of acetonitrile in 70 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, over 30 min followed by a 10-min elution with 70 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Under these conditions, elution times of thiamin, TMP, and TPP were 20, 15.6, and 14 min, respectively. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected in 8-ml scintillation vials, and radioactivity was assessed as indicated above. The levels of thiamin and its metabolites were normalized to units of nmol/g dry weight of cells. Cells (3 × 106) grown in complete RPMI 1640 were washed twice with thiamin-free RPMI and resuspended into the same medium supplemented with 30 nm[3H]thiamin. After 1 week of exponential growth, cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold HBS, and processed for intracellular tritium as described for transport studies. Thiamin uptake was assessed in several murine leukemia cell lines with different levels of RFC1 function. MTXrA is a subline of murine leukemia L1210 cells that lack RFC1 activity due to an alanine to proline substitution at amino acid 130 (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). R16 cells, derived by transfection of RFC1 cDNA into MTXrA cells (21Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), express about 10 times more RFC1 than wild-type L1210 cells. As indicated in the inset of Fig.1, MTX uptake in MTXrA cells was negligible over 30 min, whereas MTX uptake in R16 cells was very rapid and reached steady state within 10 min (22Zhao R. Seither R. Brigle K.E. Sharina I.G. Wang P.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pattern of uptake of thiamin was reversed in these cell lines. Net uptake in MTXrA cells was roughly three times greater than that of R16 cells by 1 h; in neither cell line was a steady state reached over the interval of observation (upper panel of Fig. 1). HPLC analysis indicated that at 1 h 90 ± 3 and 75 ± 6% (n = 2) of intracellular tritium was the active thiamin metabolite, TPP in R16 and MTXrA cells, respectively; in the latter the remainder of intracellular tritium was thiamin. The lower panel of Fig. 1 illustrates the decline in cell tritium when MTXrA and R16 cells were loaded with 0.2 μm [3H]thiamin for 1 h prior to resuspension into thiamin-free buffer. The decrease of intracellular tritium can be characterized by a single exponential in both cell lines, and the slope of the lines extrapolate through the time 0 points that represent the initial level of intracellular tritium. The rate constant for TPP efflux from R16 cells was 4-fold greater than from MTXrA cells, 0.58 versus 0.14 h−1, respectively. However, in both cell lines the rate of loss of TPP was only a small fraction of the rate of thiamin influx (see below). Initial thiamin uptake was assessed in L1210 and R16 cells over 20 s at an extracellular concentration of 0.2 μm. As indicated in the upper panel of Fig. 2, the initial uptake rate for thiamin in R16 cells was ∼28% higher than in L1210 cells, much less than the 9-fold difference in RFC1 expression and MTX influx between these cell lines. Moreover, addition of 25 μm MTX, which would reduce RFC1-mediated influx by at least 70% (based upon the RFC1-mediated MTX influx Kt of 7 μm(17Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and a thiamin influx Ki of 2.8 mm,see below), had no effect at all on thiamin influx in either cell line. Hence, RFC1 does not contribute to thiamin influx. The very low affinity of RFC1 for thiamin was confirmed by evaluating the inhibitory effect of this vitamin on MTX influx in L1210 cells. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2, there was a gradual increasing inhibition of MTX influx, albeit to a small degree, as the thiamin concentration was increased from 0.1 to 1 mm. At 1 mm thiamin, MTX influx was reduced by only ∼28%. Based upon the MTX influx Kt of 7 μm, the Ki for thiamin was calculated to be 2.8 mm. Since thiamin is rapidly phosphorylated to TPP in these cells, one explanation for low net thiamin uptake in cells with high level RFC1 expression (R16) is that TPP generated in the cell is a substrate for, and is exported by, RFC1. To explore this possibility, the effect of TPP on MTX influx was assessed along with the transport properties of TPP (Fig.3). TPP inhibited MTX influx with a Ki of 32 ± 5 μm(n = 3) in L1210 cells (upper panel), a value only ∼4-fold higher than the MTX influx Kt of 7 μm, consistent with a previous report (26Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 85: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TPP influx was directly related to the level of RFC1 activity. Influx in the MTXrA cells was one-fourth that of wild-type L1210 cells, and influx was 7-fold greater in R16 cells than L1210 cells. Furthermore, 25 μm MTX markedly decreased TPP influx in R16 and L1210 cells, whereas TPP initial uptake in MTXrA cells was the same in the presence or absence of 25 μm MTX (lower panel). Hence, RFC1-mediated influx of TPP is equal to, or larger than, transport mediated by other process(es). If TPP efflux is indeed mediated by RFC1, loading cells to high levels of MTX should competitively inhibit efflux of TPP and augment net TTP cellular accumulation. This was found to be the case. Incubation of R16 and MTXrA cells with 1 mm MTX resulted in intracellular MTX levels of 350 and 220 nmol/g dry wt (100 and 63 μm, respectively, based upon a ratio of intracellular water to dry weight of 3.5 μl/mg), since MTX enters cells via passive diffusion and possibly routes other than RFC1 at this high concentration. As shown in Fig. 4, intracellular accumulation of thiamin and its metabolites was doubled in R16 cells, to a level comparable to that of MTXrA cells, by pre- and co-incubation with 1 mm MTX. HPLC analysis confirmed that this increase in net uptake was due entirely to an increase in TPP accumulation. On the other hand, there was no effect of 1 mm MTX on thiamin uptake in MTXrA cells, all consistent with the lack of RFC1 function in this cell line. When L1210, MTXrA, and R16 cells are incubated with 10 mmazide in the absence of glucose, intracellular ATP is depleted, an effect at least partially reversed by addition of 5 mmglucose to the transport buffer (5Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.5 (upper panel), net thiamin uptake in MTXrA cells was higher than that in L1210 cells without energy depletion. However, thiamin uptake in ATP-depleted cells was decreased to the same level in both L1210 and MTXrA cells. Net thiamin uptake in R16 cells was markedly lower than in L1210 and MTXrA cells regardless of the energy status. This energy dependence of thiamin accumulation was further explored in L1210 cells by determination of thiamin metabolites by HPLC (lower panel of Fig. 5). Under all conditions, TMP was present at levels that were barely detectable as compared with thiamin and TPP. In energy-depleted cells, the level of thiamin exceeded that for TPP regardless of the time of exposure to tritiated thiamin (10 or 60 min), but some TPP nonetheless was present. There were slightly higher levels of both thiamin and TPP at 1 h of exposure than that at 10 min reflecting continued, albeit slow, thiamin uptake and phosphorylation. In contrast, TPP was the dominant species in energy-replete cells. The increase in TPP accumulation from 10 min to 1 h contributed almost entirely to the increase in net thiamin uptake in L1210 cells. The lower level of thiamin present in energy-replete, versusenergy-deplete, cells may be due to the rapid rate of phosphorylation relative to the rate of thiamin entry into cells. In most media, including RPMI 1640, in which murine leukemia cells are grown, the thiamin concentration (∼3 μm) is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than the physiological blood level (10–30 nm). Hence , in vitro growth conditions are highly nonphysiological with respect to this vitamin. To determine the effect of RFC1 function on thiamin accumulation under more physiological conditions, cells were grown in 30 nm[3H]thiamin for 1 week. In addition to wild-type L1210, MTXrA, and R16 cells, another eight L1210 variants were studied in these experiments. These included the following: (i) L1210-T2 cells obtained by transfection of RFC1 cDNA into wild-type L1210 cells to achieve RFC1 expression at a level about 7-fold higher than in L1210 cells (22Zhao R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); (ii) L7, L15, L44, and L51 cell lines with functional RFC1 but with markedly reduced folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity due to mutations in this enzyme (23Zhao R. Titus S. Gao F. Moran R.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26599-26606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); (iii) the D10 line with no expression of RFC1 due to a Gly to Ala substitution in the initiation codon (19Zhao R. Sharina I.G. Goldman I.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); and (iv) G1 and G2 cells with point mutations resulted in S46N and V104M substitutions, respectively, that markedly impair RFC1 activity (17Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Zhao R. Gao F. Babani S. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3304-3311PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated in TableI, thiamin accumulation generally correlated with levels of RFC1 activity. Thiamin accumulation in R16 and T2 cells was 64 and 42%, respectively, that of L1210 cells, whereas thiamin accumulation in L7, L15, L44, and L51 cells, in which RFC1 function is near normal, was comparable to that of L1210 cells. However, thiamin accumulation in G1a, G2, MTXrA, and D10 cells with markedly impaired RFC1 function was increased by factors of 1.8, 2.4, 2.8, and 2.5, respectively. On average, the level of thiamin and its metabolites in cells that overexpress RFC1 (R16 and T2) was 4–7-fold greater than in cells in which RFC1 function is absent (MTXrA and D10).Table IAccumulation of thiamine in murine leukemia cell linesCell lineRFC1 function1-aBased upon MTX influx. relative to L1210 cellsThiamine accumulationFold change in thiamine accumulation relative to L1210 cellsnmol/g dry wtL12101.04.2 ± 0.31R169.42.7 ± 0.10.64T27.41.8 ± 0.10.42L70.75.5 ± 0.21.3L150.84.8 ± 0.11.1L441.24.8 ± 0.11.1L511.13.8 ± 0.10.90G1a0.026 (MTX)7.5 ± 0.31.80.12 (5-CHO-THF)G20.0510.2 ± 0.52.4MTXrA0.01012.1 ± 0.52.8D100.01510.6 ± 0.52.5Cells grown in RPMI-1640 were harvested, washed twice with thiamine-free RPMI, and grown exponentially in this medium supplemented with 30 nm tritiated thiamine for a week.

Thiamin transport in murine leukemia cells is likely mediated by a facilitative carrier. Accumulation of its active coenzyme form is attributed to rapid phosphorylation of thiamin to TPP which is, to a large extent, retained within cells. This is a common phenomenon for many different substrates of the major facilitator superfamily, as occurs with phosphorylation of nucleosides (27Bowen D. Diasio R.B. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5333-5339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cybulski R.L. Fry D.W. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 714: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and polyglutamation of folates (29Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 263-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Consistent with this was the observation that in energy-depleted cells, phosphorylation was impaired and net thiamin uptake was markedly decreased (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the steady-state thiamin level in energy-depleted L1210 cells was ∼0.3 μm (1 nmol/g dry weight), comparable to the extracellular level (0.2 μm), consistent with an equilibrating process. Folate and thiamin, both B family vitamins, differ not only in chemical structure but also in charge. At physiological pH, folate is a bivalent anion, whereas thiamin bears one positive charge. The similarity between RFC1 and the thiamin transporter, especially in the predicted transmembrane domains, raised the possibility that these carriers may share common substrates. This was not the case. Instead, we have demonstrated that RFC1 transports the major thiamin metabolite, TPP, with an influx Ki only ∼4 times greater than the MTX influx Kt . This has important consequences with respect to the level of TTP accumulation. After thiamin enters cells it is phosphorylated to TPP and its molecular charge changes from positive to negative. This, in turn, is associated with an increased affinity for RFC1, an anion exchanger, that mediates TPP efflux, leading to a decrease in net intracellular TPP accumulation. Accordingly, TPP accumulation in these cells is enhanced by the rate of entry of thiamin mediated by the thiamin transporter and the rate of phosphorylation catalyzed by thiamin pyrophosphokinase. TPP accumulation is countered by the efflux of TPP mediated by RFC1. Hence, the net level is determined by balance of these processes. Since efflux studies show that the major portion of intracellular TPP is retained within the cells, there must be a large component that is bound to TPP-dependent apoenzymes in cytosol and mitochondria (30Bettendorff L. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 26: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, TPP may be hydrolyzed, in part, to TMP which is, in turn, exported. TMP also appears to be a good substrate for RFC1 since TMP inhibits RFC1-mediated MTX influx with a Ki of 15 μm. 2R. Zhao, F. Gao, Y. Wang, G. A. Diaz, B. D. Gelb, and I. D. Goldman, unpublished results. Increased thiamin accumulation associated with decreased RFC1 activity observed when cells were grown at a physiological thiamin concentration (∼30 nm) suggests that the ability of RFC1 to export TPP may have important biological consequences. The requirement for thiamin is ubiquitous, but thiamin-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome and dietary thiamin deficiency cause tissue-specific and nonoverlapping defects (9Kril J.J. Metab. Brain Dis. 1996; 11: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Mandel H. Berant M. Hazani A. Naveh Y. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Stagg A.R. Fleming J.C. Baker M.A. Sakamoto M. Cohen N. Neufeld E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Metabolically active tissues are vulnerable to thiamin deficiency due to heavy usage of TPP-dependent enzymes. The observation that RFC1 mediates efflux of TPP may provide another important dimension to the understanding of thiamin metabolism. Tissues with high expression of RFC1 may export more TPP, making them more susceptible to metabolic derangement when thiamin is scarce. Hence, RFC1 expression may modulate the tolerance to thiamin deficiency associated with either mutations in SLC19A2, dietary deficiency, or malabsorption. It remains to be established if RFC1 is expressed in thiamin-sensitive cell types and whether metabolic defects associated with thiamin deficiency might be modified by the level of RFC1 expression. Although TPP is not present in plasma, but accumulates in erythrocytes, TMP is present in plasma at concentrations only slightly lower than that of thiamin (31Tallaksen C.M. Bohmer T. Karlsen J. Bell H. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As indicated above, TMP is likely a good substrate for RFC1, and transport by this route could be of importance under conditions in which the thiamin transporter is defective. Hence, at high blood levels of thiamin and TMP, substantial delivery of TMP via RFC1 might obviate the consequences of the loss of the thiamin transporter, another potential role for RFC1 as a modifying element in this clinical situation. RFC1-mediated TPP transport could also play a role in thiamin absorption in intestine. Dietary vitamin B1 exists predominantly as thiamin pyrophosphate that is hydrolyzed to thiamin by a phosphatase in the intestinal lumen before absorption. RFC1 is expressed in intestine and is proposed to mediate folate absorption (32Chiao J.H. Roy K. Tolner B. Yang C.H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11165-11170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Kumar C.K. Nguyen T.T. Gonzales F.B. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C289-C294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that some TPP may be directly delivered into mucosal cells by RFC1 before hydrolysis to thiamin is achieved. Furthermore, TMP is derived from dephosphorylation of TPP and/or transphosphorylation of thiamin by a membrane-associated alkaline phosphatase in intestinal mucosa (34Rindi G. Ricci V. Gastaldi G. Patrini C. Arch. Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 103: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Matsuda T. Maeda S. Baba A. Iwata H. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1978; 24: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). TMP has been shown to cross everted rat jejunal sac wall unchanged and enter the serosal fluid (36Patrini C. Reggiani C. Laforenza U. Rindi G. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is possible that this process is RFC1-dependent. We thank Laibin Liu for technical assistance."

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This fold was initially identified in a group of C-type (Ca2+-dependent) animal lectins (sugar-binding proteins) that mediate both pathogen recognition and cell-cell communication by means of protein-carbohydrate interactions (2Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, multidomain arrangement, and functional criteria the extensive superfamily of CTLDs has been subdivided in a variety of groups (3Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Among them, those that are predicted to bind sugars through coordination to a conserved Ca2+ ion are also known as carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). The structure of several CRDs has been solved, and their binding to sugars has been thoroughly characterized (1Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence shows, however, that many of the modules that adopt a CTLD fold lack the Ca2+-coordinating residues that mediate the classical C-type lectin sugar binding properties, suggesting that they may serve functions other than saccharide recognition (1Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The CTLD fold is widely represented among proteins that mediate the innate immune response (6Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). In particular, a conserved genomic region known as natural killer (NK) gene cluster (NKC) encodes for a group of receptors with CTLD-containing sequences that are involved in modulation of NK-cell activity and natural host defense (6Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 7Brown M.G. Scalzo A.A. Matsumoto K. Yokoyama W.M. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins are type II transmembrane receptors, usually expressed as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers. Each subunit comprises a single extracellular CTLD, specifically named NK domain (NKD), connected by a neck region of variable length to a single membrane-spanning region and a short intracellular N-terminal portion (reviewed in Refs. 8Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar and 9López-Botet M. Bellón T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic regions are often involved in signaling by recruitment, through specific sequence motifs, of kinases and phosphatases. Alternatively, some activating receptors, bearing short cytoplasmic tails devoid of any specific signaling sequence, associate noncovalently with membrane-anchored signaling molecules (10Bléry M. Olcese L. Vivier E. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Some receptors encoded in the NKC, such as the CD94/NKG2 heterodimers and the mouse Ly49 family, have proved to bind molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (11Ugolini S. Vivier E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12López-Botet M. Llano M. Navarro F. Bellón T. Semin.

Sánchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 17Testi R. D'Ambrosio D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Contrary to other NKC gene products, whose expression is restricted to NK cells, CD69 has been found in the surface of most hematopoietic lineages (reviewed in Ref. 18Marzio R. Mauel J. Betz-Corradin S. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1999; 21: 565-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is one of the earliest markers induced upon activation in T and B lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils. In addition, it is constitutively expressed on monocytes, platelets, Langerhans cells, and a small percentage of resident lymphocytes in thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues (19Sánchez-Mateos P. Cebrián M. Acevedo A. López-Botet M. De Landázuri M.O. Sánchez-Madrid F. Immunology. 1989; 68: 72-79PubMed Google Scholar). CD69 is also present on B cell precursors in the bone-marrow, and recent studies with CD69-deficient mice revealed its modulatory role on B cell development and antibody synthesis (20Lauzurica P.

It has been demonstrated that CD69 acts as a signal-transmitting receptor. Its cytoplasmic portion is constitutively phosphorylated on serine residues (21Testi R. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. J.

Even when the actual ligand that triggers this receptor is not known, cross-linking of CD69 by specific antibodies activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway (23Zingoni A.

In summary, CD69 wide distribution, along with its activating signal-transducing properties, suggest an important role of this receptor in the physiology of leukocyte activation. As a first step toward better understanding the structural basis for CD69 function, we have undertaken the production and analysis of soluble constructs of the CD69 extracellular region. We report here the three-dimensional structure of human CD69 NKD determined in two crystal forms. We compare it with other known CTLD structures, specifically those present in NKC receptors, describe its dimeric oligomerization, and suggest a putative ligand-binding site. The complete NKD of human CD69 (residues 82–199) was amplified from cDNA (14López-Cabrera M. Santis A.G. Fernández-Ruiz E. Blacher R. Esch F. Sánchez-Mateos P. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned intoNdeI-BamHI restriction sites of pET 26b plasmid (Novagen) (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) by double digestion and subsequent ligation. Restriction sites and a TAA termination codon were added to the insert using the following primers: CD695s, 5′GCGCGCGCGCATATGGTTTCTTCATGCTCTG; CD693, 5′GCGCGCGGATCCTTATTTGTAAGGTTTG. Automatic DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) of the cloned 1insert using T7 promoter primer rendered the correct sequence. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3), and these cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.7 cm−1 and then induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. After 4 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT. They were lysed by adding lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the viscosity was reduced by sonication. The protein was obtained as insoluble aggregates forming inclusion bodies, which were extensively washed three times in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl, 1 murea, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The protein was solubilized in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 8 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and insoluble material was discarded by centrifugation. The CD69 NKD was refolded by the method of dilution of denaturing conditions following a modification of the protocol originally described for MHC class I molecules (30Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Urea-solubilized CD69 NKD was added by slow dilution to 1 liter of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 400 mml-arginine, 2 mm EDTA, 6.3 mmcysteamine, 3.7 mm cysteamine, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Repeated pulses were added every 12 h. After 36 h, the refolding mixture was concentrated under nitrogen to a volume of 5 ml and purified by gel filtration chromatography in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In these conditions, CD69 NKD elutes as a noncovalent dimer, although the peak shows a slight asymmetry, consistent with an equilibrium between the monomeric and dimeric forms. Correctly sized fractions were further purified by cation exchange chromatography using a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was loaded in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 and eluted with a linear gradient to 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. For crystallization, the protein was buffer-exchanged into 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl and concentrated to 5 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained by mixing aliquots of the protein solution with an equal volume of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, 150 mm zinc sulfate or sodium sulfate, and 15% polyethylene glycol 6000. Two different crystal forms grew in these conditions. Long and thin prisms of square section, which belong to the tetragonal system, predominated, whereas larger irregular crystals, occasionally with a triangular shape and that belong to the trigonal system, appeared infrequently. The tetragonal crystals belong to the space group P43212 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 69.6 Å and c = 118.6 Å and contain one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The trigonal crystals belong to the space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 48.4 Å, c = 119.9 Å, a = β = 90°, and γ = 120° and contain a monomer in the asymmetric unit. For cryogenic data collection, crystals were harvested in a modified reservoir solution, transferred to harvest buffer containing 15% glycerol or ethylene glycol, and flash-cooled by plunging into liquid propane. The high resolution data sets used for the structure refinement of both crystal forms were collected at beam line ID14-3 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, using a MarResearch charge-coupled device, whereas the initial data set in the tetragonal form used for the structure determination was collected at beam line ID14–2 using an ADSC Quantum4 charge-coupled device.

Structure factors from 15.0 to 5.0 Å were used for the rotation and translation functions. Model phases were improved and extended from 5.0 to 2.6 Å by iterative cycles of density modification in DM (34Cowtan K.D. Joint CCP4 ESF-EACMB Newslett. 1994; 31: 34Google Scholar), which consisted of solvent flattening and 2-fold averaging. The resulting electron density maps allowed unambiguous building of the molecule, including extensive portions, like helix α2, not present in the initial truncated model.

Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restrains were initially applied to all regions except the flexible loops involved in lattice contacts. When the high resolution data set for this crystal form became available, the noncrystallographic symmetry restrains were gradually relaxed based on the behavior of the R free. All regions of CD69 NKD are well ordered, with the exception of the tip of the β2-β2′ hairpin, one residue at the N terminus, and the last two residues at the C terminus, which show poor density and high B factors. The model contains residues from 83 to 199 for both subunits, and 69 solvent atoms. The present R crysis 24.8, and R free is 27.0 for all data (F > 0) between 25.0 and 1.95 Å. The trigonal crystal form was readily solved using a partially refined model from the tetragonal crystal form and was similarly refined in CNS. Electron density maps clearly showed two possible conformations for residues at the carboxy end of helix α2. Therefore, residues 133 to 136 were modeled in two alternate conformations with half-occupancy. All residues, including the β2-β2′ hairpin, showed in the electron density maps. The model contains residues from 83 to 199 for both subunits, and 115 solvent atoms. The presentR crys is 22.9%, andR free is 24.4% for all data (F>0) between 20.0 and 1.50 Å. Refinement statistics for both crystal forms are given in Table I. Structure superpositions were done with SHP (38Stuart D.I. Levine M. Muirhead H. Stammers D.K. J. Mol.

The human CD69-NKD sequence was aligned to representatives of the NKD family using ClustalW at ExPASy on the Internet and were subsequently edited manually based on the known structures of rat mannose-binding protein (MBP)-A (PDB accession code 1ytt), mouse Ly49A (1qo3), and human CD94 (1b6e). Sequences were retrieved from GenBankTM (hCD69, NP_001772.1; hMAFA-L, AAC32200; hAICL, NP_005118; hLLT1, NP_037401; hNKRP1A, NP_002249; hKLRF1, AAF37804; hCLEC2, AAF36777.1; hCD94, NP_002253; hNKG2A, NP_002250.1; mLy49A, I49361) and Swiss-Prot (mCD69,P37217; rMBP-A, P19999). The alignment figure was drawn using ESPript (46Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics ( Oxf. ). 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). Human CD69 consists of a 40-residue intracellular domain, a 21-residue transmembrane region, and an extracellular portion that comprises a 20-residue neck and an NKD of 118 amino acids. Soluble forms of CD69 NKD, comprising residues 82 to 199, were prepared by in vitro refolding from material expressed in E. coli. Recombinant CD69 NKD retains binding to a panel of specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing four distinct epitopes (16Sánchez-Mateos P. Sánchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and it behaves as a noncovalent dimer during gel filtration (results not shown). The structure of CD69 NKD was determined by molecular replacement in two different crystal forms, tetragonal and trigonal, and refined to 1.95 and 1.50 Å, respectively. The quality of the diffraction data and refinement statistics are given in TableI. The tetragonal crystal form contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a molecular 2-fold axis. The electron density is continuous in the final 2F o− Fc map from residues 83 to 199, except for the exposed β2-β2′ hairpin that shows weak density and appears to be disordered (see below for a description of secondary structure elements). In the trigonal crystal, the CD69 NKD dimer is crystallographic, and there is a single molecule in the asymmetric unit. In this crystal form, all residues (83 to 199), including the β2-β2′ hairpin, are in good, continuous density in the final electron density maps. The C-terminal end of helix α2 shows static disorder and has been modeled in two alternate conformations in the trigonal form. Pairwise superpositions of the three independent copies for CD69 NKD give r.m.s. deviations from 0.27 to 0.40 Å for main chain atoms between residues 89 and 198. The largest differences are focused in the domain N terminus, around the β turn (residues 86–89), which precedes strand β0, and the β2-β2′ hairpin. In the tetragonal form, this flexible hairpin is exposed to the solvent, whereas in the trigonal crystal it is better ordered because of crystal packing interactions. Description of the structure is based on the high resolution trigonal model unless specifically stated. The α-carbon trace of CD69 NKD is shown in Fig. 1 A. As predicted by its amino acid sequence, the overall structure of CD69 NKD displays the salient features of the CTLD fold. The domain, with overall dimensions of 44 × 32 × 30 Å, consists of two connected antiparallel β sheets and two α helices, like in the CRD of C-type animal lectins (1Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and mouse Ly49A NKD (47Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Strand β2 acts as a connection between the two β sheets formed by strands β0, β1, β5, β2, and β1′ in the lower part of the molecule (following the standard view for CTLD folds as shown in Fig. 1) and strands β2′, β2, β3, and β4 in the upper part. This portion of the molecule is also characterized by a long stretch, connecting strands β2′ and β3, lacking regular secondary structure. This region corresponds to the Ca2+-binding site of true C-type lectins. The two helices, α1 and α2, are located one on each side of the extended β structure. There are three intrachain disulfide bonds in CD69 NKD (Fig. 1), two of which (Cys113–Cys194 and Cys173–Cys186) correspond to the characteristic invariant disulfides found in all CTLDs. The third disulfide bond, Cys85–Cys96, connects a loop at the N terminus, which precedes the first β strand (β0), with strand β1 by linking two cysteines separated by 10 residues in this segment. This disulfide is only found in long-form C-type lectins (including lithostathine, tetranectin, and factors IX/X-binding protein) (4Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and appears to be present in most NKD domains (Fig.2). In members of the rodent Ly49 gene family, however, these two bonded cysteines are separated by only four residues and are located on contiguous β strands (47Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). Despite the low sequence identity between CD69 NKD and other CTLDs, which ranges from around 20% with CRDs of animal lectins to almost 30% for other NKDs, the overall structure of the domain is highly conserved. Superposition of CD69 with other CTLDs gives rise to r.m.s. deviations of between 1.2 Å for 100 equivalent Cα atoms with Ly49A and 1.4 Å for 95 equivalences with rat MBP (48Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The major differences among them occur at the N terminus, the position of helix α2, hairpin β2-β2′, the loop connecting it to strand β3, and hairpin β3-β4 (Fig. 1 B). These regions coincide with segments displaying higher variability in length and amino acid sequence among members of the NKD family (Fig. 2). Overall, CD69 NKD is more similar to long-form CTLDs, like tetranectin or lithostathine, and to other NKDs, like Ly49A. Although based on sequence identity the NKD structure closer to CD69 is that of the CD94 subunit of the NK-cell receptor CD94/NKG2 (around 28% identical), their superposition gives an r.m.s. deviation of 1.4 Å for 97 equivalent Cα positions. This relatively poorer match is mostly due to differences between helix α2 in CD69 and the equivalent region in CD94. In the crystal structure of the CD94 NKD homodimer, this helix is replaced by a loop that is involved in the dimerization interface (33Boyington J.C. Riaz A.N. Patamawenu A. Coligan J.E. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).

The unraveling of this α helix in the crystal structure of CD94 NKD could be because of the formation of the homodimer, whose physiological role is uncertain. The amino acid sequence at this region retains a distribution of hydrophobic residues that appears suitable for the formation of an α helix, but analysis of sequence alignments reveals that, in CD94 and NKG2 proteins, this segment is two residues shorter than in the majority of NKD sequences. Whether the lack in CD94 of this α helix is due to the formation of the homodimer or consequence of the deletion at the C-terminal end of this segment w"

The major tobacco cpRNPs are composed of five species: cp28, cp29A, cp29B, cp31, and cp33 and these are divided into three groups (I, II, and III). By immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, and Western blot analysis, we demonstrated that these cpRNPs are abundant stromal proteins that exist as complexes with ribosome-free mRNAs. Many ribosome-free <i>psbA</i> mRNAs coprecipitate with cpRNPs, indicating that the majority of stromal <i>psbA</i> mRNAs are associated with cpRNPs. In addition, an <i>in vitro</i> mRNA degradation assay indicated that exogenous <i>psbA</i> mRNA is more rapidly degraded in cpRNP-depleted extracts than in nondepleted extracts. When the depleted extract was reconstituted with recombinant cpRNPs, the <i>psbA</i>mRNA in the extract was protected from degradation to a similar extent as the <i>psbA</i> mRNA in the nondepleted extract. Moreover, restoration of the stabilizing activity varied following addition of individual group-specific cpRNPs alone or in combination. When the five cpRNPs were supplemented in the depleted extract, full activity was restored. We propose that these cpRNPs act as stabilizing factors for nonribosome-bound mRNAs in the stroma."

https://openalex.org/W1972347745,"The physical interaction of epithelial cells with the basement membrane ensures correct positioning and acts as a survival factor for epithelial cells. Cells that detach from the basement membrane often undergo apoptosis; however, in carcinomas, this positional control is absent, permitting disorganized cell proliferation. In the majority of breast and ovarian carcinomas (85–90%), the expression of a candidate tumor suppressor, Disabled-2 (Dab2), is frequently lost. The Dab2-negative tumor cells are no longer in contact with an intact basement membrane, as indicated by the absence of collagen IV (in about 90% of cases). However, in the subset (10–15%) of ovarian tumors in which Dab2 expression is positive, the presence of a basement membrane-like structure around tumor cells was observed. Recombinant adenovirus-mediated expression of Dab2 was used in Dab2-negative ovarian and breast cancer cells, and re-expression of Dab2 was found to lead to cell death or growth arrest. Dab2 expression suppressed MAPK activation and c-fos expression. Plating the infected cells on a basement membrane matrigel rescued the cells from death and growth arrest. Thus, Dab2 exhibits a negative activity for cell growth and survival, which can be countered by attachment of the cells to basement membrane matrix. We conclude that Dab2 functions in cell positioning control and mediates the exigency for basement membrane attachment of epithelial cells. Loss of Dab2 may contribute to the basement membrane-independent, disorganized proliferation of tumor cells in ovarian and breast carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2067967250,"p16INK4a is frequently altered in human cancer, often through epigenetically mediated transcriptional silencing. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of this gene. To learn more about such control, we initiated studies of proteins that bind to the promoter in cancer cells that do, and do not, express the gene. We identify RNA helicase A (RHA) as a protein that binds much better to the p16INK4a promoter in the expressing cells. RHA has not previously been characterized to manifest sequence-specific DNA interaction but does so to the sequence 5′ CGG ACC GCG TGC GC 3′ in the p16INK4a promoter. The Drosophilahomologue to RHA, maleless (Mle), functions in the fly for 2-fold activation of male X-chromosome genes. In our experimental setting, RHA induces a similar modest up-regulation of the p16INK4a promoter that is dependent upon its sequence-specific interaction. Mle colocalizes with hyperacetylated H4Ac16 on the X-chromosome and some autosomal loci. The decreased binding of RHA to p16INK4a in our cells, where the gene is transcriptionally inactive, is associated with decreased amounts of RHA that immunoprecipitate with acetylated lysine antibodies. Finally, we show RHA to be a cellular substrate for caspase-3, which decreases its sequence-specific binding to p16INK4a by cleavage of the N terminus. Thus, we have identified a new protein interaction with the p16INK4a promoter that involves an important protein for transcriptional modulation.

Dysregulation of this pathway either through loss of Rb or p16INK4a or amplification of cyclin D1 causes abnormal cell cycle regulation at the G1/S checkpoint (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4925) Google Scholar). Whereas Rb is commonly mutated within the coding region (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4925) Google Scholar), gene deletions and transcriptional silencing are preferred mechanisms for p16INK4a loss in tumor cells (2Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). The transcriptional silencing is associated in most tumors with abnormal hypermethylation that extends over the proximal promoter and the 5′ untranslated region of the gene both in primary tumors and in cell lines (2Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Several studies have established that loss of p16INK4a function is an early event in tumor progression (3Belinsky S.A. Nikula K.J. Palmisano W.A. Michels R. Saccomanno G. Gabrielson E. Baylin S.B.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5642-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread alterations of p16INK4a in tumorigenesis, little is known about the molecular events that control its transcriptional expression and that might predispose tumor cells to abnormal transcriptional silencing of the gene. We have thus initiated a search for specific DNA-binding proteins whose function, if compromised, might contribute to events leading to such abnormal regulation of the p16INK4a gene promoter, including hypermethylation of the region. In this paper, we describe a sequence-specific differential binding of human RNA helicase A (RHA)1 to the p16INK4a promoter sequences in cells with unmethylated versus methylated endogenous p16INK4a genes. RHA is a homologue of maleless (Mle), a dosage compensation gene in Drosophila (7Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mle, along with msl-1,msl-2, and msl-3, is needed for the hyperactivation of the single male X-chromosome in flies (8Kuroda M.I. Kernan M.J. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Baker B.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 935-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and this complex colocalizes with hyperacetylated H4Ac16 on the X-chromosome and in some autosomal loci (9Bone J.R. Lavender J. Richman R. Palmer M.J. Turner B.M. Kuroda M.I. Genes Dev. 1993; 8: 96-104Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this regard, in our studies, RHA appears to have a potential modulatory role for p16INK4a transcription. Nuclear proteins from culture lines were extracted according to Dignam et al. (10Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Protein amounts were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). All oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc. Binding reactions were performed in 1× binding buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 ng/ml pepstatin, 100 ng/ml leupeptin, 100 ng/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice in a volume of 20 μl. Each reaction contained, in addition, 1 μg of poly(dA)·poly(dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a nonspecific competitor. Nuclear extracts were preincubated with nonspecific and specific competitors for 10 min on ice before addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Gel shifts were run for 2 h in 1× low salt, tris-acetate EDTA (6.75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 33 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.9) on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Nuclear proteins (30 μg) were separated on a 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon™ (Millipore) membrane, which was treated with 6 m guanidine HCl in binding buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl) for 5 min. The membrane was then denatured by treatment with decreasing concentrations of guanidine-HCl (3, 1.5, and 0.75 m) in binding buffer and finally with binding buffer alone. Each step was for 5 min at room temperature. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk in binding buffer overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 100,000 cpm of concatemerized B4 oligonucleotide (see Table I) in the binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times for 5 min each with cold binding buffer.Table IOligonucleotides used in gel shift analysesp16A 5′AAG GAA ACG GGG CGG GGG CGG ATT TCT TT 3′p16B 5′CAG AGG GTG GGG CGG ACC GCG TGC GCT CG 3′p16C 5′CAG GGA GGC CGG AGG GCG GTG TGG GGG GCA G 3′B4 5′gatCGG ACC GCG TGC GCT CGG atc 3′B4M1 5′CGG ACC GAG TGC GCT CGG GCG 3′B4M2 5′CGG ACC GAG GGA GCT CGG GCG 3′B4M3 5′CGG ACC CCT TGC GCT CGG GCG 3′B4M4 5′CGG ACC GCG TCC CCT CGG GCG 3′B4M5 5′CGG ACC GTG TGC GCT CGG GCG 3′Spl 5′ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG 3′The top three lines of the table show p16 INK4apromoter sequence oligonucleotides used for initial gel shift analyses to characterize protein binding patterns to the region.

The Sp1 oligonucleotide was used to compete away binding of Sp1 family proteins in some gel shift studies. Concatemerized B4 molecules (see Table I) with a biotin label in one end were attached to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal AB). Total nuclear protein fraction from cell line NCI-H69 (0.5 × 109 cells) was mixed with nonspecific competitor poly(A)·poly(T) (60 ng/ml) and oligo B4M1 (2 ng/ml; see Table I) in 1× binding buffer with proteinase inhibitors. After 50 min of incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 17,000 × g, and the supernatant was added to the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The binding reaction was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with rotation. Beads were washed two times with binding buffer and eluted with 0.4 m KCl in binding buffer. Eluted proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie stained. Selected proteins were excised and analyzed by MALDI-MS at the Keck Foundation (Yale University, New Haven, CT). For transfection studies, the ATG site initiating translation of the p16INK4a was mutated to a BamHI site with polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using an oligonucleotide, 5′ AAA G GA TCC GCT GCT CCC CGC CGC CCG CT 3′. p16INK4a promoter constructs of 0.9 kb (EcoRI-digested region) or 2.0 kb (HindIII-digested region) upstream of the ATG were cloned in pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega). Mutation in the RHA binding site described under “Results” was introduced by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis with the oligonucleotide 5′ CTG GCT GGT CAC C AG AGG GTG GGG CGG ACC GAG TGC GCT C 3′ (with the underlined base representing the site where C in the original sequence is mutated to A (mutant oligo B4M1; see Table I)). The polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotide included an endogenous BstEII site in the 5′ end, allowing the replacement of a BstEII-BamHI fragment in the wild-type constructs. All constructs were verified by sequencing. An expression plasmid containing the RHA cDNA in pcDNA3 was a gift from Dr. Che-Gun Lee. One day before transfections 2 × 105 U1752 cells were plated and the next day transfected with 1 μg of wild-type or mutant p16INK4a promoter-luciferase constructs and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). In cotransfection experiments, 1 μg of luciferase construct was transfected along with 1 μg of RHA expression plasmid or with vector plasmid alone. Transfections were incubated for 4 h. NCI-H69 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmids and 2.5 μl of DMRIE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h. A renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) was used to control for transfection efficiency, and luciferase activities were measured at 24 h using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). All transfections were done in triplicate, and results are shown from three independent experiments. The RHA cDNA in the pRSET plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Che-Gun Lee. Deletion constructs AvaIII and XhoI were prepared from the full-length cDNA by removing amino acid regions 841–1270 and 693–1052, respectively, from the C-terminal end of the protein. 1 μg of plasmid DNA was transcribed and translated using the Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system from Promega. 5 μl of the reaction was analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels or in a gel shift assay. Trichostatin A (TSA) treatments were for indicated periods with 500 nm TSA (Wako). Control reactions were treated with EtOH. The caspase-3-specific inhibitor DEVD (final concentration 50 μm) was added 1 h before addition of TSA. Western blotting was performed using standard protocols (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies and protein-A-agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Sp1 PEP2, Sp3 D-20, Sp4 V-20), except for topoisomerase, which was from TopoGEN, Inc. RHA antiserum was a kind gift from Dr. Che-Gun Lee. Immunoprecipitations with acetylated lysine antibodies were performed as described in the product manual (New England Biolabs) and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline before loading on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. With respect to differences in normal and abnormal control of p16INK4a transcription, we first chose to examine Sp1 binding activities for the p16INK4a promoter. Such sequences have been proposed for a role in protection of CpG islands from methylation (11Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 12Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5163-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We extracted nuclear proteins from several cell lines, representing tumors of different tissue types, and with or without p16INK4a hypermethylation-associated transcriptional silencing, to establish whether any gross differences were detected in binding of Sp1 family proteins (14Kingsley C. Winoto A. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar) to p16INK4a sequences in gel shift assays. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used in the binding studies are described in Table I. Gel shift analysis with all three putative Sp1 elements from the proximal p16INK4a regulatory region showed strong binding of three specific proteins (a, b, and c in Fig. 1, A and B). Using Sp1- and Sp3-specific antibodies in supershift analysis (data not shown), we identified two Sp3-specific shifted complexes (b and c) and one Sp1 specific shift (a) at each site (Fig. 1, A and B). We did not detect any quantitative differences in binding of these two proteins between different culture lines with or without methylation of the endogenous p16INK4a . Furthermore, all cell lines also had high levels of expression of both Sp1 and Sp3 by Western analysis (data not shown). Although protein extracts from all cell lines had uncompromised binding of Sp1 and Sp3 factors to p16INK4a -specific sequences, one of the oligonucleotides produced a distinctive pattern of shifted complexes (Fig. 1 B). Oligonucleotide p16B, located at −76 to −48 nucleotides from the translation start site (Fig. 1 C, position B), shifted a protein that was not recognized by Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 antibodies in supershift analysis (data not shown), and there were marked differences between the relative binding activities for this complex for the different cell lines used in the study. The complex was markedly diminished in each cell line with a hypermethylated endogenous p16INK4a gene (Fig. 1 B,arrow). This decreased binding was especially evident by comparing the intensity of the novel band to that for the Sp3 band (Fig. 1 B, c). These differences were even more clearly apparent in gel shifts in which we used an unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide to compete the shifted complexes due to Sp1 or Sp3 binding (Fig.2 A). Although some binding was detectable for the novel complex in every cell line, binding activity was strongest in the NCI-H69 cell line and other cell lines with an unmethylated and a highly expressed p16INK4a gene and much weaker in cell lines with a hypermethylated, epigenetically silenced p16INK4a gene (Fig.2 A). By testing a series of oligonucleotides surrounding the Sp1 consensus sequence (data not shown), we determined the minimal binding sequence, 5′ CGG ACC GCG TGC GCT G 3′ (sequence B4 in Table I), that was able to compete away the novel complex. This sequence overlaps with the 3′ end of the Sp1 site in oligonucleotide p16B (Table I) and extends downstream. We next designed a panel of mutant oligonucleotides to test the sequence specificity of the interaction (Table I). Interestingly, all the mutations inside the minimal sequence affected the binding, and most of them abolished it altogether (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, mutation in the overlapping Sp1 consensus site, which abolished Sp1 binding, did not eliminate binding of the newly detected protein (data not shown). Using the information from these competition studies, we constructed a concatemerized B4 oligonucleotide. This labeled, concatemerized probe was used in a Southwestern analysis to determine the size of the unknown DNA-binding protein. We did not detect any nuclear proteins binding to this probe from cell lines with an epigenetically silenced p16INK4a gene (Fig.2 C), whereas a single 130-kDa protein band was detected from cells that had a transcriptionally active p16INK4a gene (Fig. 2 C). We used a concatemerized double-stranded wild-type sequence probe, B4 (Table I), labeled at one end with biotin, to purify the DNA binding activity. To increase the stringency we added an excess of an oligonucleotide containing a single base pair mutation, B4MI (Table I), and a nonspecific homopolymer poly(dA)·poly(dT) to the binding buffer. Nuclear proteins from NCI-H69 cells were preincubated in the presence of competitors, and specific proteins binding to the recognition sequence were separated using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. After extensive washing, DNA binding activity was eluted using increasing salt concentrations. Presence of the binding activity at each step was detected by gel shift analysis (Fig. 3 A). Approximately equal amounts of two major proteins (130 and 160 kDa) were purified in the binding fraction eluted with 0.4 m KCl as detected by Coomassie staining of an SDS gel (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of these proteins by MALDI-MS identified both proteins as human RNA helicase A, a homologue of the Drosophila dosage compensation protein, maleless (Mle). Both of these molecular mass forms of human RHA have been recognized by other investigators although the determinants of the size differences are not known (15Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To verify that RHA indeed was the protein that produced the original shifted complex, we tested binding of RHA proteins, produced from an RHA cDNA (Fig.4 D) in a rabbit reticulocyte TnT lysate system, to the original p16INK4a -specific oligonucleotide,p16B (Table I) using gel shift analysis. The lysate contained some endogenous RHA that was detected by anti-RHA antiserum, but we were able to produce exogenous RHA in higher quantities (Fig.4 A, lane 2). As shown in Fig. 4 B,lane 2, this produced a much stronger complex in the gel shift than for the TnT reaction using a control template (Fig.4 B, lane 1). To further show that RHA indeed can specifically bind to the p16INKa regulatory region, we transfected an RHA expression plasmid and a vector control into cultured cells and detected binding activity by gel shift analysis. Expression of the exogenous RHA but not of the vector alone caused an increase in the specific complex detected by gel shift (Fig.4 C). This increase in binding can be seen in both cell lines with or without a methylated endogenous p16INK4a gene (data not shown), but the relative increase in the shift was larger in the cell line, NCI-H69 (Fig. 4 C), that initially contained more endogenous binding and has an unmethylated endogenous gene. To determine what domains of RHA are needed for its sequence-specific binding to the p16INK4a promoter region, we deleted, from the RHA cDNA, portions encoding for the C-terminal end of the protein, translated these plasmids in TnT reactions (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and 4), and tested DNA binding activity using gel shift analysis (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3 and 4). Both deletion constructs AvaIII, lacking amino acids 841–1270 from the C-terminal end of the protein, and XhoI/1, lacking the conserved helicase domains five and six (amino acids 693–1052), retained full binding activity. Thus, the binding activity resides in the N-terminal end, which contains the two double-stranded RHA binding domains (15Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We tested whether RHA can modulate activity of the p16INK4a promoter in transient transfection assays. p16INK4a promoter-luciferase constructs containing 0.9 or 2.0 kb of wild-type p16INK4a promoter sequence upstream from the ATG site (Fig. 1 C) and with or without a mutation in the RHA binding site were transfected into U1752 cells. The basal expression of the mutant constructs was consistently 30% less than that for the wild-type constructs at 24 h after transfection (Fig.5 A). In addition, cotransfection studies with a plasmid expressing human RHA produced a 1.5-fold increase in luciferase activity of the wild-type construct at 24 h, whereas activity from the mutant construct did not show this increase (Fig. 5 B). We next wanted to identify factors that might affect the sequence-specific binding of RHA and be determinants of differences in this activity between the cell lines studied. We first sequenced RHA coding regions from the cell line U1752, which has a low sequence-specific binding activity and a methylated p16INK4a gene, to detect any mutations that might contribute to lowered activity of RHA. However, no mutations were found (data not shown). In addition, no overall differences were seen in the total amounts of RHA protein between cell lines by Western analysis (see Fig. 6). The identification of the 130-kDa protein under the denaturing conditions of the Southwestern analysis suggested that RHA is able to bind to the p16INK4a region without a partner protein. It then seemed most likely, from all of the above data, that binding differences between cell lines might be a result of differences in posttranslational modification of the RHA. Because RHA has been shown to interact with the transcriptional coactivator cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (17Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), which has acetylase activity, one possible modification of RHA is acetylation. To evaluate the role of acetylation in the RHA binding to the p16INK4a promoter, we first treated U1752 and NCI-H69 cells with TSA, a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor (18Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 18 h and analyzed DNA binding by gel shift assay. As shown in Fig. 6 A, TSA treatment of U1752 cells did not affect the DNA binding activity of RHA to a p16INK4a -specific oligonucleotide (lanes 1 and 2). However, in NCI-H69 cells, TSA treatment caused a marked decrease in the sequence-specific DNA binding of RHA (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and 4). A complete time course indicated that this decrease became apparent 12 h after TSA administration (data not shown). Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of total proteins with RHA-specific antibodies revealed a difference in isoforms of RHA between control-treated and TSA-treated NCI-H69 cells (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4), which also appeared only after 12 h of TSA treatment (data not shown). This indicated to us that TSA treatment caused a shift in either posttranslational modification or degradation of the protein in NCI-H69 cells; this was not seen in U1752 cells (Fig.6 B, lanes 1 and 2). We next analyzed control- and TSA-treated samples by immunoprecipitations with acetylated lysine antibodies. Immunoreactive RHA could be immunoprecipitated from both NCI-H69 and U1752 cells (Fig.6 C, lanes 1 and 3) with acetylated lysine antibodies. However, the amount of RHA complexed with acetylated lysine antibodies was considerably less in U1752 cells (a cell line with reduced RHA binding activity to the p16INK4a -specific sequence) than in NCI-H69 cells. Yet, both cell lines contain the same steady state amount of total RHA (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1 and 3). In NCI-H69 cells the smaller isoform of RHA produced by TSA treatment was brought down less efficiently with acetylated lysine antibodies than was the full-length form (Fig. 6 C, lane 4). In U1752 cells no change was seen in RHA complexed with acetylated lysine antibodies after TSA treatment (Fig. 6 C, lane 2). It was interesting that TSA induced a change in the form of RHA associated with the decreased binding in NCI-H69 cells. In addition to its direct inhibition of histone deacetylases, TSA has been shown recently to have later, and indirect, effects on apoptosis associated with induction of caspase activity (19Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707PubMed Google Scholar). In the NCI-H69 cells, the new form of RHA seen after TSA treatment was estimated to be 145 kDa, 15 kDa smaller than the full-length (160 kDa) RHA. Analysis of the RHA amino acid structure revealed the sequence EEVD, a putative caspase-3 cleavage site, in the N-terminal portion of the molecule between the two previously identified double-stranded RNA binding domains (Fig. 4 D). Cleavage at this site would cut a 15-kDa fragment off the N-terminal portion of the RHA molecule. To test whether TSA might be inducing such cleavage, we incubated NCI-H69 cells with the caspase-3 specific inhibitor DEVD before addition of TSA. This inhibitor substantially reduced formation of the 145-kDa TSA-specific form of RHA and also substantially reversed the TSA-induced decrement in RHA binding to the p16INK4a promoter (data not shown). These findings further localize the region of the protein responsible for the binding to the far N terminus of the molecule. In the present study we have defined a sequence, 5′ CGG ACC GCG TGC GC 3′, in the context of the p16INK4a promoter region, that specifically binds RNA helicase A. We show that this binding activity of RHA is decreased in tumor cell lines with an epigenetically silenced p16INK4a gene. This decrement appears to be associated with decreased amounts of RHA that immunoprecipitate with acetylated lysine antibodies. In an experimental setting RHA can induce a modest up-regulation of the p16INK4a promoter, and this modulatory activity is dependent upon the sequence-specific interaction of RHA with the promoter. Finally, we show that RHA is a substrate for caspase-3 and that sequence-specific binding of RHA to the p16INK4a promoter is sensitive to caspase cleavage. The transcriptional modulatory activity of RHA in our study may best be considered in the context of defined functions of Mle, the RHA homologue in Drosophila (20Bashaw G.J. Baker B.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the male fly, this protein functions, together with MSL proteins, to ensure 2-fold increase in transcription of the single male X-chromosome. Although Mle is only transiently or loosely associated with the complex, it may be the essential factor in the process by recruiting the other proteins (20Bashaw G.J. Baker B.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The precise manner in which RHA modulates transcription is not known. RHA is a member of the DEAH-box DNA/RNA helicases (15Zhang S.

https://openalex.org/W2053978606,"Maf oncoprotein is a basic-leucine zipper (bZip) type of transcriptional activator. Since many transcription factors are known to form functional complexes, we searched for proteins that interact with the DNA-binding domain of Maf using the phage display method and identified two homeodomain-containing proteins, Hoxd12 and MHox/Prx1/Phox1/Pmx1. Studies with mutants of Hox and Maf proteins showed that they associate through their DNA-binding domains; the homeodomain of Hox and the bZip domain of Maf, respectively. Reflecting the high similarity of the bZip domain, all other Maf family members tested (c-/v-Maf, MafB, MafK, MafF, and MafG) also associated with the Hox proteins. Pax6, whose homeodomain is relatively similar to MHox, also could interact with Maf. However, two other bZip oncoproteins, Fos and Jun, failed to associate with the Hox proteins, while a distantly related Hox family member, Meis1, could not interact with Maf. Through interactions with the bZip domain, the Hox proteins inhibited the DNA binding activity of Maf, whereas the binding of Hox proteins to their recognition sequences was not abrogated by Maf. We further showed that coexpression of the Hox proteins repressed transcriptional activation and transforming activity of Maf. These results suggested that the interaction of a set of Hox proteins with Maf family members may interfere not only with their oncogenicity but also with their physiological roles.

Nishizawa M. Virology. 1992; 188: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its product, v-Maf, contains a basic-leucine zipper (bZip) structure at its carboxyl terminus, forms a homodimer, and recognizes relatively long palindromic sequences named Maf-recognition elements (MARE: TGCTGACTCAGCA and TGCTGACGTCAGCA) (3Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J.

MARE sequences include the phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate-13-acetate-responsive element (TGACTCA) and cyclic AMP-responsive element (TGACGTCA), which are recognized by various homo- and heterodimers of AP-1 (Jun/Fos) and the ATF/CREB family of bZip proteins. Maf is a transcriptional transactivator, and the DNA binding and transactivation activities are necessary for its transforming ability (4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). Structural analysis of v-maf and its cellular counterpart c-maf revealed that the v-Maf protein had no structural change compared with c-Maf except that it was fused to the viral Gag protein at the initiator methionine residue of c-Maf (2Kawai S. Goto N. Kataoka K. Saegusa T. Shinno-Kohno H. Nishizawa M. Virology. 1992; 188: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In accordance with this finding, expression of c-maf under control of a retroviral long terminal repeat causes efficient transformation of CEF cells (5Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, c-maf overexpression was found in a fraction of human multiple myelomas that resulted from chromosomal translocation to the immunoglobulin heavy or light chain locus (7Chesi M. Bergsagel P.L. Shonukan O.O. Martelli M.L. Brents L.A. Chen T. Schröck E. Ried T. Kuehl W.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 4457-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of c-maf was also found in melanoma cells due to the insertion of the melanoma-associated retrovirus (MelARV) (8Li M. Huang X. Zhu Z. Gorelik E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9178-9186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, several maf-related genes have been isolated from various vertebrates, including human, mouse, rat, chicken, quail, frog, and zebrafish. They are divided into two subfamilies according to the structures of the encoded proteins. The first group, which consists of c-Maf, MafB, Nrl, and MafA/L-Maf, has an amino-terminal transactivation domain in addition to the COOH-terminal bZip domain and are called large Maf proteins. The second group, MafK, MafF and MafG, lack the amino-terminal domain and thus are called small Maf proteins. One of the most important control mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by bZip factors is homo- and heterodimerization through leucine zipper domains. For example, the small Maf proteins can positively regulate a set of erythroid-specific genes as heterodimers with another b-Zip protein, NF-E2 p45, a member of the Cap'n'collar family of transcription factors (9Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 10Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the small Maf proteins also can act as repressors for the erythroid-specific genes by forming homodimers or heterodimers with c-Fos (11Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similarly, the small Maf proteins can form dimers with another bZip factor Bach2 and act as a B-cell-specific negative regulator of the immunoglobulin heavy chain 3′ enhancer (12Muto A. Hoshino H. Madisen L. Yanai N. Obinata M. Karasuyama H. Hayashi N. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. Groudine M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As for v-/c-Maf, it has been shown to form heterodimers with both Jun and Fos (4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). The functional importance of Maf/Jun or Maf/Fos heterodimers is not yet known, but these heterodimers are different in their DNA binding specificity from Maf homodimers or AP-1 complexes and are likely to regulate a distinct set of cellular genes. Jun and Fos are the most well characterized nuclear oncoproteins, and their interaction with members of other bZip protein families such as ATF/CREB and C/EBP has been examined (14Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 16Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.-L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Jun and Fos are known to form many kinds of functional complexes with different classes of transcription factors. For example, direct interaction of the Jun/Fos heterodimer with the NF-AT transcription factor is necessary to activate expression of T-cell-specific genes (17Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z.

Interactions of Jun and Fos with the glucocorticoid receptor or some members of the Ets family also have been reported (19Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 20Yang-Yen H.-F. Chambard J.-C. Sun Y.-L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26188-26195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These studies shed light not only on their physiological roles but also on the mechanisms of cell transformation. In the case of c-Maf, interaction with the proto-oncogene product c-Myb was found to regulate transcription of the CD13/APN gene during myeloid cell differentiation (22Hedge S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Its close relative, MafB, also has been shown to interact with and to repress transcriptional activity of c-Ets-1, which leads to inhibition of differentiation of erythroid cells (23Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Collectively, fine tuning of cell type-specific gene expression and lineage-specific cell differentiation seems to be achieved by cooperative and inhibitory interactions of transcription factors. Disregulated expression of a nuclear oncoprotein thus may affect the cell differentiation program, which in turn may lead to cell transformation. To understand the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and cell transformation by Maf, it is important to clarify the regulatory cross-talk that occurs with other transcription factors. To this end, we utilized the phage display method to screen a cDNA expression library for genes whose products interact with Maf and isolated two genes that encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors, Hoxd12 and MHox/Prx1/Phox1/Pmx1. These two proteins repressed DNA binding and transforming activities of Maf by interacting with its bZip domain. The possible biological significance of this interaction network also will be discussed. cDNA was made from poly(A)+RNA isolated from whole chicken at embryonic day 8 and was inserted into the EcoRI and HindIII digested pT7Select1–1b vector (Novagen), which should display products of the inserted cDNA on the surface of T7 phage particles as a fusion product with its capsid protein. Phage were packaged in vitro and used to infect the host bacterial strain, BLT5403 (Novagen). Enrichment of recombinant phage that expressed candidate Maf-binding proteins by biopanning was performed as recommended by the manufacturer with some modifications. Briefly, wells of microtiter plates were coated with bacterially expressed and purified maltose binding protein (MBP) or MBP-Maf fusion protein in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and blocked with 10% Blockace (Dainihon Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan) in TBS. A 10-μl aliquot of fresh phage lysate (1 × 108 pfu/μl) containing 2.2 × 106 independent clones was incubated in a MBP-coated well at room temperature for 30 min to absorb phage particles that have affinity for MBP or blocking reagent. Then the lysate was transferred into a MBP-Maf-coated well, incubated for 30 min, removed, and the well washed five times with 200 μl of TBS containing 0.1% of Tween 20. The phages that remained in the well were eluted with 20 μl of TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and amplified in BLT5403 cells. After seven rounds of this two-step biopanning procedure, the titer of MBP-Maf bound phage was five times higher than background. The eluted phages were combined with host cells to form plaques on agar plates. The cDNA insert of individual phages was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using T7Select UP and DOWN primers (Novagen), subcloned into the EcoRI-HindIII site of pUC19, and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. Construction of the prokaryotic expression vector for the MBP-Maf fusion protein has been described (4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell.

The procedures for expression of MBP and MBP-Maf proteins in Escherichia coli and for purification by amylose resin chromatograhy (New England Biolabs) also have been described previously (4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produce a GST-fusion protein of Hoxd12 in E. coli, a hoxd12 cDNA isolated by the phage display method was digested with BamHI at the 3′-noncoding region, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, ligated with EcoRI linkers, and digested with EcoRI. The resultant EcoRI fragment encoding the 103 COOH-terminal amino acids of Hoxd12 was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pGEX-3X plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST and GST-Hoxd12 proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatograpy (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA fragments encompassing the entire open reading frames of hoxd12, mhox, and pax6 of chicken and meis1 of mouse were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from total RNA from day 8 whole chicken embryo and from the Balb/c/3T3 cell line, respectively, using specific primers (hoxd12, 5′-AGAGCGCGCAGTCCTTTGTTGGAAATGTG-3′ and 5′-AGAGCGCGCCGCGCTAGTACATAGAGAG-3′; mhox, 5′-AGAACGCGTACGAGGAAAAGCCCCCGCTG-3′ and 5′-GAGACGCGTGCGAAGCAGCTGCCCCCAG-3′; pax6, 5′-GAGACGCGTGCCTGCCCCGGCCCACCATGC-3′ and 5′-GAGACGCGTGAATTAACACATGTTTTACTG-3′; meis1, 5′-AGAACGCGTAGGAAGGGAGCCAGAGAGG-3′ and 5′-AGAACGCGTAGATGAAGGTTACATGTAGTG-3′). Products were digested with BssHII or MluI and inserted into the MluI site of pGEM3-MluI or pGEM4-MluI vectors (25Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar). To construct hoxd12ΔHD, three methionine codons for in vitro labeling by 35S and a termination codon were introduced instead of the 207th lysine codon of hoxd12cDNA by PCR using the primer, 5′-GAGCGCGCTACATCATCATTGTGTACGGTTTCCGTTTC-3′, and the hoxd12 forward primer, and inserted into pGEM3-MluI after BssHII digestion.

Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. For in vitro translation of human c-Jun and c-Fos, a PmaCI-StyI fragment of c-jun cDNA and a HaeII-BanI fragment of c-foscDNA, both of which contain entire open reading frames, were blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase, ligated with MluI linkers (pGACACGCGTGTC), and inserted into pGEM4-MluI. These plasmids were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes and were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. 10 μl of the programmed extracts were added to 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 together with 20 μl of amylose resin or glutathione-Sepharose 4B immobilized with MBP or GST fusion proteins, respectively. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, samples were washed three times with 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). XhoI restriction sites were introduced at the first leucine residue of the zipper structure of Maf and Jun by the method of Kunkel (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers (5′-CTCCGACTCgAGGACGTGCCGC-3′ for v-maf and 5′-CACTTTTTCcTCgAgCCTGGCAATCC-3′ for v-jun) without changing amino acids, and the resultant plasmids were used to construct a chimera of maf and jun (maf(jun-zip)). Maf, Jun, Fos, and Hox proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega), and were analyzed by a gel mobility shift assay as described previously (4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes containing MARE (probe 7) or AP-1 (probe 11) also have been described (4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the Hoxd12 recognition sequence (27Shen W.-F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) was made from the oligonucleotides: 5′-GATCCTTCACTCCGTTTTACGACAGGAGTA-3′ and 5′-GATCTACTCCTGTCGTAAAACGGAGTGAAG-3′. For eukaryotic expression,BssHII fragments of hoxd12 or Hoxd12ΔHD were inserted into a unique BssHII site of the pEF-BssHII expression vector (24Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), a derivative of pEF-BOS. The pEF/v-maf expression plasmid and the luciferase reporter plasmid 3×MARE/RBGP-luc, containing three copies of MARE (oligonucleotide 7) and rabbit β-globin minimal promoter, have been described (6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). pEF-Rluc, used to normalize transfection efficiencies, was constructed by inserting a XbaI-NheI fragment containing the open reading frame of the Renilla luciferase gene (pRL-TK, Promega) into the XbaI site of pEF-BOS, followed by deletion of the replication origin of SV40 by HindIII digestion and self-ligation. 3 × 105 CEF cells, grown on a 35-mm dish, were transfected with a total of 1 μg of plasmid (125 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 750 ng of expression plasmids, and 125 ng of pEF-Rluc plasmid) using 1 μl of Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were harvested at 18 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). To construct a NotI cassette plasmid with the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), an EcoRI-NotI-EcoRI adaptor (5′-AATTCGGCGGCCGCGGATCCCCTCGAGTTCG-3′ and 5′-pAATTCGAACTCGAGGGGATCCGCGGCCGCCG-3′) and an NcoI-SmaI-NotI-EcoRI adaptor (5′-AATTCGGCGGCCGCGGATCCGACCCGGGATC-3′ and 5′-pCATGGATCCCGGGTCGGATCCGCGGCCGCCG-3′) were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the EcoRI-NcoI fragment of pCITE-1 (Novagen) containing the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus and inserted into the EcoRI site of a modified pUC vector. An NcoI restriction site was introduced into the 75th codon of hoxd12 and Hoxd12ΔHD in the pGEM3-MluI plasmid by PCR using the primers, 5′-GAGCCATGGGCTCCGTTCCAATC-3′ and SP6 primer. The PCR fragment was digested with HindIII at the 3′ polylinker site, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, digested with NcoI, and inserted into the NcoI and SmaI-digested IRES cassette plasmid to make pUC/IRES-hoxd12 and pUC/IRES-Hoxd12ΔHD. The NotI fragments containing IRES-hoxd12 and IRES-Hoxd12ΔHD were then inserted into the unique NotI site of the replication-competent avian retroviral vector, pRV-9. Subsequently, the MluI fragment containing chicken c-maf or chicken v-fos was introduced into a unique MluI site in the plasmid. To construct the chicken v-fos MluI fragment, the initiator methionine codon and an NcoI restriction site were created at the fusion point of gag and fos of the NK24 provirus (28Nishizawa M. Goto N. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3733-3740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the MluI site in the coding region was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides, 5′-CCCCAGGAGccATggTCAACTCGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCTAtGCaTCGGACTGGGAG-3′, respectively. The modified v-fos fragment was introduced into the NcoI-MluI site of the pRAM plasmid (5Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by addition of an MluI linker to the ApaI site at the 3′-noncoding region followed by digestion with NcoI and MluI. Preparation and maintenance of CEF cells have been described previously (24Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For the focus formation assay, 2.5 μg of the recombinant retrovirus vector plasmid DNA was transfected into 1.2 × 106 CEF cells grown on a 60-mm dish using 12.5 μl of Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. On the day following transfection, the cells were trypsinized and appropriately diluted with fresh CEF cells to give a total of 1.2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. The cells were then overlaid with medium containing 0.4% agar and tested for focus formation. We selected cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with the carboxyl terminus DNA-binding domain of Maf by the phage display method (for datails see ”Experimental Procedures“). In brief, a cDNA library constructed from chicken whole embryo RNA was inserted into the T7Select vector, which expresses protein encoded by inserted cDNA on the surface of the phage particle as a fusion with phage capsid protein. Recombinant phage particles that express putative Maf-binding proteins were enriched by multiple rounds of biopanning on microtiter plates coated with purified Maf protein fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-Maf). After seven rounds of selection, cDNA inserts of individual phages were amplified by PCR, subcloned, and sequenced. As a result, of 16 clones analyzed, 11 clones were derived from at least three independent cDNA molecules of the chicken mhox/prx1/phox1/pmx1 gene. Four other clones were derived from at least two independent cDNA species of chicken hoxd12. As shown schematically in Fig.1 A, both MHox and Hoxd12 proteins contain a homeodomain, which is a DNA-binding motif composed of 60 amino acids. Although all cDNA species isolated were partial, they all fused to the capsid protein of the T7 phage in frame and retained their homeodomains. Furthermore, they had no sequence similarity with each other except for their homeodomains (Fig.1 B), suggesting that Maf binds to these conserved domains of MHox and Hoxd12. hoxd12 is a member of the Abdominal B (Abd-B) group of hoxD cluster genes and has been shown to be involved in limb pattern formation (29Nohno T. Noji S. Koyama E. Ohyama K. Myokai F. Kuroiwa A. Saito T. Taniguchi S. Cell. 1991; 64: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). MHox was originally isolated as a member of the paired class homeobox proteins from mice that are expressed only in cells of mesodermal origin and bind to A/T-rich elements of the muscle creatin kinase enhancer (30Cserjesi P. Lilly B. Bryson L. Wang Y. Sassoon D.A. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 1087-1101PubMed Google Scholar). Its chicken and human counterparts, prx1 and phox1, were isolated as homeobox genes predominantly expressed in the developing limb (31Nohno T. Koyama E. Myokai F. Taniguchi S. Ohuchi H. Saito T. Noji S. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and as an interacting partner of the serum response factor (32Grueneberg D.A. Natesan S. Alexandre C. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1992; 257: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), respectively. mhox is also identical to a recently reported gene named pmx1, which was found at a chromosome translocation break region in human acute myelogenous leukemia cells (33Nakamura T. Yamazaki Y. Hatano Y. Miura I. Blood. 1999; 94: 741-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that two homeodomain-encoding cDNAs were isolated independently and that homeobox proteins are transcriptional regulators prompted us to further analyze these cDNAs. To confirm the interaction of these homeobox proteins with Maf, we cloned the entire open reading frames of hoxd12 and mhoxcDNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR, subjected them to in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine, and tested for coprecipitation with MBP or MBP-Maf protein immobilized onto amylose resin. As shown in Fig.2 A, both Hoxd12 and MHox proteins were specifically coprecipitated with MBP-Maf but not with MBP. Deletion of the homeodomain of the Hoxd12 protein (Hoxd12ΔHD) resulted in loss of specific association with Maf, indicating that the homeodomain is necessary for this interaction. We also could detect recombinant GST-Hoxd12 and GST-MHox proteins (see below) immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes by West-Western method using the MBP-Maf fusion protein as a probe (data not shown), indicating direct interaction of Maf and Hox proteins. MHox and Hoxd12 are not the closest members among the homeoprotein family (Fig. 1 B). We thus suspected that other homeodomain-containing proteins also could associate with Maf. To test this possibility, we chose Pax6, which contains the paired class of homeodomain with high homology to that of Mhox. We also chose Meis1, whose homeodomain is distantly related to both MHox and Hoxd12 (Fig. 1 B). Pax6 and Meis1 were translated in vitro and subjected to the coprecipitation assay with the MBP-Maf fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Pax6 protein specifically associated with MBP-Maf, whereas Meis1 did not. These results showed that Maf could interact with a set of, but not all, homeodomain-containing proteins. We next tried to identify domains in Maf required for interaction with the homeobox proteins. Hoxd12 and MHox proteins fused to GST were expressed in E. coli, purified by glutathione beads, and used to test for association with a set of in vitro translated mutant Maf proteins. Schematic structures of the Maf mutants used in this assay are shown in Fig.3 A, together with their DNA binding abilities and transforming activities (4Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows the coprecipitation results for a set of mutant Maf proteins with GST or GST-Hoxd12. Essentially the same results were obtained using GST-MHox (data not shown). The full-length v-Maf protein was efficiently coprecipitated with GST-Hoxd12 but not with GST, confirming the specific association of Maf and Hoxd12 proteins. Mutants with a deletion of the COOH-terminal, but which retain most of the zipper structure (CD1 and CD2), could associate with Hox, but further deletion of three out of six leucine repeats (CD3) resulted in a large reduction in the amount of coprecipitated protein. Deletion of the entire bZip domain (CD4) lead to complete loss of association. Disruption of the α-helical structure of the leucine zipper by amino acid substitutions of two leucine residues with prolines (L2PL4P) significantly affected the binding with GST-Hoxd12, suggesting that the intact leucine zipper structure is required for the interaction. A mutant, ND5, with a deletion of the amino-terminal region, contains the same region present in the MBP-Maf fusion protein and thus can associate with GST-Hoxd12. The mutant, ND6, which contains further deletions and cannot bind to DNA, could still efficiently be coprecipitated. On the other hand, deletion of either the basic domain (MD56) or the preceding region (MD45), which is also necessary for DNA binding, significantly affected the interaction. A deletion of only five amino acids in the basic region (MD26.22) effectively abrogated the association. The Q5H mutant, which contains a glutamine to histidine substitution in the hinge region o"

We can now analyze the sequence differences that cause this variation of quaternary structure. phosphoglycerate mutase cofactor-dependent PGM cofactor-independent PGM Phosphoglycerate mutases (PGMs)1 are enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. They can be subdivided into two types: cofactor-dependent PGM (dPGM) and cofactor-independent PGM (iPGM). Whereas vertebrates, yeasts, and many bacteria have only dPGM, and higher plants, nematodes, archaea, and many other bacteria have only iPGM, a small number of bacteria including Escherichia coli have both (1Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). dPGMs have three catalytic activities. The main activity is that of amutase (EC 5.4.2.1), catalyzing the interconversion between 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate. A second activity is as a phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.13), converting 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and water to 3-phosphoglycerate or 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphate. The third activity is thesynthase activity (EC 5.4.2.4), where 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is converted to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The label “cofactor-dependent” comes from the observationin vitro that to be active, the native protein must be phosphorylated by 2,3- bisphosphoglycerate.

Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar)), which also contains the phosphatase domain of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase family as well as prostatic acid phosphatase and phytase. The common fold of these proteins is commensurate with their use of phosphohistidine as a catalytic intermediate. Other examples of N-phosphorylation at histidine occur in bacterial signaling proteins (12McEvoy M.M. Dahlquist F.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in enzymes such as fructose permease (13Schauder S. Nunn R.S. Lanz R. Erni B. Schirmer T. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11062-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by x-ray crystallography being the only examples to date. None of these structures represent the phosphoglycerate mutase-like fold family. We now report the structure of E. coli dPGM in its phosphorylated, active conformation. The structure of a dimeric dPGM provides a basis for examining the residues involved in interactions in the varying oligomerization states observed in dPGMs. The establishment of this structure as representative of the active conformation of the enzyme and comparison with the available dephosphorylated structures provide new information regarding the roles of specific residues in the complex catalytic mechanism of this class of enzymes. The E. coli (K12) pgm1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by a polymerase chain reaction using the 5′ and 3′ end-specific primers 5′ CCC-GCG-CAT-ATG-GCT-GTA-ACT-AAG 3′ and 5′ CGC-GGA-TCC-TTA-CTT-CGC-TTT-ACC-CTG 3′. These oligonucleotides (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) introducedNde I and Bam HI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). Taq polymerase, DNA ligase, and the relevant restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. The polymerase chain reaction product (∼0.75 kilobases) was gel-purified (Qiaex extraction kit, Qiagen) and cloned into pUC18 (SureClone, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and positive clones were identified by restriction digest. The DNA fragment was ligated into theBam HI/Nde I-cleaved plasmid pET3a (Novagen) to give the pET3a-pgm construct that was amplified in E. coli JM109 (Novagen), and the integrity of the gene was confirmed by sequencing. E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was heat shock-transformed with pET3a-pgm and selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Single colonies were cultured, and the expression of protein with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was tested under a range of conditions. E. coli dPGM was then overexpressed and purified as described previously (1Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown from hanging drops (2 μl of protein, 1-μl reservoir) from a protein solution containing dPGM (15 mg ml−1) in 20 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) with 100 mm NaCl and a reservoir comprising 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.75, 200 mmLi2SO4, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000. The crystals are orthorhombic (P 21212 with a ≈ 62 Å, b ≈ 113 Å, andc ≈ 40 Å) with a solvent content of 50%, corresponding to one monomer of protein per asymmetric unit. Data (TableI) were collected at SRS Daresbury station 9.6 (λ = 0.87 Å) on an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector, processed with DENZO, and scaled with SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was performed with AMORE (18Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar) using data to 2.0 Å and a search model derived from S. cerevisiae dPGM (the highest resolution structure available at 1.7 Å, Protein Data Bank code 1QHF (7Crowhurst G.S.

The suitability of the best solution was confirmed by the presence of the correct dimer interface provided by the crystallographic 2-fold. Subsequent phase improvement and automated building were achieved using wARP (19Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Multiple conformers were refined with total occupancy restrained to 1.0. Occupancies were refined for the two sulfates in the active site, whereas the chloride, located on a 2-fold axis at the dimer interface, is modelled with 0.5 occupancy. At an early stage in the refinement it was noted that three waters lie adjacent to the Nε2 of His10 in a tetrahedral arrangement. In the center of these atoms was a prominent peak of residual electron density corresponding to ∼0.5 that of an omitted ordered solvent molecule. His10 is the nucleophilic histidine that becomes phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle. Although there are two histidines that have roles in catalysis, the term “active site histidine” will be used exclusively for His10. The geometry of the imidazole, three water molecules, and peak (N-P distance, 1.74 Å; O-P distances, 1.50 ± 0.02 Å) was in agreement with the structure of phosphorylimidazole found in the Cambridge Structural Data base ((22, 23); CADPIM (24Beard L.N. Lenhert P.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1968; 24: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). The outstanding quality of the diffraction data allowed us to successfully refine His10 as a partially occupied phosphohistidine with its occupancy coupled to a histidine and three solvent water molecules (Fig.1). The resulting model has 0.28 occupancy phosphohistidine and 0.72 occupancy histidine plus three water molecules. We had no reason to expect histidine phosphorylation prior to crystallization, because the half-life of the phosphohistidine is expected to be of the order of 35 min, as observed with the S. cerevisiae enzyme (25Nairn J. Krell T. Coggins J.R. Pitt A.R. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Walter R. Price N.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The excellent quality, high resolution data have led to a reliable, precise model with root mean square deviations from Engh and Huber bond lengths and angle distances of 0.014 and 0.030 Å (26Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). No residues have disallowed φ/ψ angles, and only Ala182 has generously allowed values, as defined by PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The α/β fold of the monomer of E. coli dPGM is the same as S. cerevisiae dPGM, as expected from their 54% sequence identity (Fig.2 a). In summary, the protein core consists of a six-stranded β-sheet, C-B-D-A-E-F, with all but E being parallel, flanked by six α-helices (Fig. 2 b). The active site is located at the C-terminal edge of the β-sheet and is constructed from stretches of sequence dispersed throughout the amino acid sequence. The active dimer is formed by the antiparallel alignment of the C strands of two monomers. Comparison of the dimeric structure with the S. cerevisiae tetramer highlights the structural basis for the different oligomerization states. The S. cerevisiae and E. coli monomers superpose in LSQMAN (28Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å over 227 Cα atoms. Despite having a largely similar backbone structure, the region of lowest sequence similarity (residues 124–145) provides a number of important differences at the S. cerevisiae tetramerization interface. Significant substitutions include Asp141(S. cerevisiae)–Ser143(E. coli), which abolishes a hydrogen bond to Trp162* (* signifies a residue of another subunit); Pro142–Glu144, which alters the local backbone conformation significantly for a stretch of four residues; Val144–Glu146, which produces a steric clash with Gln163*; Asp164–Glu166, which breaks a salt bridge to Arg83*; and Lys168–Pro170, which causes a steric clash with the main chain of Tyr139*. TheS. cerevisiae K168P mutant has indeed been shown to reduce the K m of tetramerization (29White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); but whereas the introduction of this proline into a helix does disrupt the hydrogen bond network, the change in backbone conformation is insignificant, and it is the position of the proline side chain that disrupts the interface interaction (Fig. 3). An explanation for the inability of S. pombe dPGM to dimerize is less clear, particularly given the lack of a three-dimensional structure. Sequence comparison suggests a number of interactions present in the E. coli and S. cerevisiae proteins that are absent in S. pombe. These dimer-forming interactions come from two stretches of sequence including residues 58–77 and 136–139. The first stretch forms helix α3 and the adjacent strand βC, whereas the second stretch is part of the region discussed above that promotes tetramerization in S. cerevisiae. The positions where the S. pombe sequence differs from both E. coli and S. cerevisiae include Val58(E. coli)–Ala63(S. pombe), which causes the loss of a hydrophobic contact, and Ala76–Pro81, which is likely to cause some distortion of the backbone. A significant hydrophobic packing interaction of Trp77 with Arg138* and Tyr139* is also lost on substitution of Trp to Asn82 and deletion of the loop from 124–147. These comparisons reveal that there are no major structural rearrangements between dPGMs. Rather, the differences are restricted to amino acid changes at the subunit interfaces. Given that all dPGMs, whether monomeric, dimeric, or tetrameric, retain essentially the same activity, a question remains as to the biological function of these distinct quaternary assemblies. Although no measurements have been made of the phosphohistidine half-life ofE. coli dPGM, there was no reason to expect it to be any longer than the 35 min observed for S. cerevisiae dPGM; yet the presence of phosphohistidine in the crystals indicates that a certain level of phosphorylation must persist for considerably longer. Whereas the native structure has only 0.28 occupancy phosphohistidine, the remainder of dephosphorylated protein also adopts the active conformation, with water molecules occupying the vacant phosphate oxygen positions. We cannot rule out the possible contribution of crystal-packing forces in aiding the dephosphorylated protein to adopt the active conformation. The native structure presented here is representative of the enzyme in its competent, phosphorylated form and is used as such in the following discussion; the S. cerevisiae structures are typical of an inactive or inhibited dephosphorylated form. Comparison of these two forms indicates significant structural differences. The C-terminal tail of the protein, with the exception of the final two residues, is ordered in the phosphorylated form. This tail, the subject of much speculation regarding its possible role in the catalytic cycle (30Walter R.A. Nairn J. Duncan D. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Rigden D.J. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), is not modelled in the S. cerevisiae structures because of disorder. The conformation of His10 when phosphorylated is distinct from that in the yeast structures, and the adjacent residues in the loop from Arg9 to Thr22 have moved up to 1.7 Å (Cα-Cα distance) relative to the equivalent residues in the S. cerevisiae structure. dPGM has a cup-shaped active site that is 16 Å deep and 10 by 8 Å wide, with a volume of ∼1200 Å3containing up to 36 ordered solvents and 2 sulfates. This extensive cavity is lined by atoms from 43 residues: 9–23, 36, 61, 88–91, 99, 111–116, 183–188, 203–209, and 239–247. The roles of these residues can, to a large extent, be divided into three categories: the catalytic machinery, the residues responsible for substrate binding, and the site of access where substrates enter and products leave (Fig.4 a). The residues at the base of the active site that surround His10 are strictly conserved among the E. coli,S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and human dPGM family (black circles in Fig. 2 a). Interactions between the phosphohistidine and the rest of the protein are depicted in Fig. 4 b, with interatomic distances given in TableII. The His10 side chain is held in position in both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms by a hydrogen bond between Nδ1 and the amide oxygen of the adjacent Gly11. The length of this hydrogen bond decreases on phosphorylation, accompanied by the movement of residues 9–22. One of these residues, Asn16, alters its side chain conformation to allow Nδ2 to form a hydrogen bond with a phosphate oxygen (3.18 Å) and the Oδ1 to participate in a CH···O hydrogen bond with Cε1 of His10 (3.14 Å). A second phosphate oxygen accepts a hydrogen bond from His183 Nδ1 (2.72 Å), which is itself hydrogen-bonded via its Nε2 atom to Ser57 (data not shown). His183 may also serve as a proton source during catalysis, because it is spatially adjacent to the active site acid Glu88. The other basic residues that bind the phosphate group are Arg61, which forms a hydrogen bond to the same oxygen as His183 via its Nε atom (2.96 Å), and Arg9, which forms a hydrogen bond to the third phosphate oxygen via Nε (2.74 Å). This oxygen is also hydrogen-bonded to the amide nitrogen of Gly184, which is the N-terminal residue of a 12-residue α-helix (α8). This helix (gray in Fig.2 b) is conspicuous on a ribbon diagram because it lies more perpendicular to the β-sheet than do the other flanking helices and is oriented such that the N-terminal helix dipole contributes to stabilization of the phosphohistidine, rather than to the stabilization of another substrate phosphate group, as previously proposed (31Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the polar interactions with the phosphoryl group, the aliphatic segments of the side chains of Arg9 and Arg61 also provide a series of hydrophobic contacts that contribute to the orientation of the imidazole ring of His10. Whereas the interactions with Arg61are conserved on dephosphorylation, those with Arg9are completely abolished.Table IIPhosphohistidine hydrogen bonding interactionsPhosphohistidine atomPartner atomDistanceÅNAla182-O2.95Nδ1Gly11-O2.64Cε1Asn16-Oδ1 3.142-aC–H · · · O hydrogen bond.Oη2Sulfate1001-O42.36Oη2Asn16-Nδ23.18Oη3Arg61-Nε2.96Oη3Arg61-Nη23.19Oη3His183-Nδ12.72Oη3Glu88-Oε12.78Oη4Arg9-Nη23.22Oη4Arg9-Nε2.74Oη4Glu88-Oε13.09Oη4Water3017-O2.832-a C–H · · · O hydrogen bond. Open table in a new tab The binding and presentation of substrates for phosphorylation or dephosphorylation is mediated by active site residues between 2 and 12 Å from the active histidine. In addition to the phosphohistidine, the active site of the E. coli structure contains two sulfate ions derived from the crystallization medium. It is likely that these binding sites are formed by residues that are involved in binding the phosphate groups of the mono- and bisphosphoglycerate substrates. Two of the S. cerevisiae crystal forms also have two sulfates in the active site, and in the case of 1QHF a partially occupied 3-phosphoglycerate has been modelled overlapping one of these sulfates (7Crowhurst G.S. Dalby A.R. Isupov M.N. Campbell J.W. Littlechild J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest that the two pairs of sulfate binding sites in S. cerevisiae and E. coli are different (their positions are displaced by 3.1 and 4.0 Å, respectively) and thus in combination describe four sites where the phosphate moieties of the substrates may bind, with implications for the enzyme mechanism. For simplicity, the designations E1 and E2 are used to identify the two sites observed in the E. coli structure, and Y1 and Y2 are used to identify those sites identified in the S. cerevisiae structures. When the protein structures are superposed, Y1 is 3.9 Å from the position of the phosphoryl group of the phosphohistidine forming hydrogen bonds to the phosphohistidine-stabilizing residues Arg61 and Asn16 and to Ser13. Site E1 is located further from the phosphohistidine and also participates in a hydrogen bond with Arg61, but its most important interactions are with the amide nitrogens of Thr22 and Gly23. Sites Y2 and E2 are formed, in the main part, by interactions with Arg115 and Arg116, both of which are strictly conserved residues. These arginines form hydrogen bonds with residues in the access site (discussed below) and probably contribute to linking catalytic events to structural change at the access site. The structure of the C-terminal tail of dPGMs has remained a mystery throughout previous structural and biochemical studies. Most S. cerevisiae structures do not include residues past 236 (E. coli sequence numbering). 1QHFcontains residues up to 242, but those beyond 238 have temperature factors that have been truncated at 100.12 Å2. In the native structure presented here, the tail is well defined up to Lys247 (Fig. 5). This observation strongly implies that the ordering of the C terminus is commensurate with enzyme phosphorylation and thus typical only of the active enzyme. The access site as a whole consists of the rim of the active site cavity and the C-terminal tail, which forms a lid. The rim is formed by residues Glu12, Lys17, Asn19, Lys32, Glu36, Ala100, Asp108, Lys112, Glu204, Asn206, and Thr209, whereas the C-terminal tail consists of residues 238–249 (Lys-Ala-Ala-Ala-Val-Ala-Asn-Gln-Gly-Lys-Ala-Lys) and is highlighted inmagenta in Figs. 2 and 4 a. The basic secondary structure of the tail is a β-hairpin based around a β-turn at Ala243–Gly246. This motif extends away from helix α10 across the active site opening, forming a number of hydrogen bonds with residues of the rim and substrate binding region (Fig. 5). Ala239-O forms a hydrogen bond with Asn206-Nδ2, whereas Asn206-Oδ1 accepts a hydrogen bond from the substrate binding residue Arg116. The side chain of Val242 interacts with Lys247, whereas its amide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of another substrate binding residue, Arg115. Asn244-Oδ1 also forms a hydrogen bond to Arg115. In the S. cerevisiae structures these two arginine side chains are oriented differently to bind sulfate rather than to form the interactions listed above, which may promote the disorder of the tail. The hydrogen bond between Asn244-O and the side chain of Asn19 is the only direct link between the C-terminal tail and the stretch of residues from 9–22. Ala243-O and Gly246-N form the hydrogen bond that makes the β-turn. This places Asn244 and Gln245 in the correct orientation to hydrogen-bond to the active site rim residue, Asp108, a residue that is conserved throughout the full-length dPGMs and was previously proposed to bind the C-terminal lysine residues. The observed interactions serve as a clasp to pin the tail over the active site. It has been proposed that adoption of an ordered conformation by the tail when the protein is phosphorylated prevents solvent access and thus phosphoenzyme hydrolysis (31Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). The present work shows this to be unlikely because up to 36 ordered water molecules are found in the cavity, but there may be a less direct role in phosphohistidine stabilization. S. pombe dPGM is typical of a group of “short” dPGMs (also including Zymomonas mobilis andHaemophilus influenzae) that have no C-terminal tail. Limited proteolysis of S. cerevisiae dPGM, removing the C-terminal seven residues, produces a protein of similar character toS. pombe dPGM with markedly reduced mutase activity and enhanced phosphatase activity (30Walter R.A. Nairn J. Duncan D. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Rigden D.J. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Most of the residues involved in interactions that hold the tail in place are conserved among all “full-length” dPGMs and link, via one or two residues, directly to the substrate binding region. This hydrogen-bonding network is shown in Fig. 4 a. We propose that Arg115 and Arg116 provide the switch with which the substrate in the active site induces a change between active and inactive forms by making interactions with the tail residues more or less favorable. When the active form is selected, the interactions of the tail with Asp108 provide further stability to the conformation. The real key to preserving the phosphohistidine is the conformation of Asn16. This residue forms two hydrogen bonds with the phosphohistidine and lies on the loop from residues 9–21, which may well be constrained in the active form by the interaction of Asn19 with the C-terminal tail. The crystal structure of a dPGM in its competent, phosphorylated form advances our understanding of the contributions from various parts of the dPGM structure in determining and regulating catalysis. Of particular importance is the ordered structure of the C-terminal portion of the polypeptide, which has been an enigma for many years. The structure of this tail differs from predictions and redefines the proposed roles of a number of residues. The dimeric structure has allowed us to identify the determinants of the distinct oligomerization states of dPGMs, although it remains unclear why such variety exists. The analysis of the structural changes on phosphorylation suggests important roles for previously overlooked residues, such as Asn16 and Asn19, which can now be investigated through site-directed mutagenesis. The existence of a crystal form of dPGM that diffracts to atomic resolution provides an excellent basis for such studies and also allows further investigation of substrate and inhibitor binding.

It has been reported that human blood platelets that showed no response to collagen lacked the surface expression of GPIa/IIa or GPVI, indicating that GPIa/IIa and GPVI are collagen receptors (2Nieuwenhuis H.K.

These proteins have been very useful for investigating the signal transduction pathways mediated by GPVI. Cross-linking of GPVI results in phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ (FcRγ)-chain by the Src family kinases, Fyn and Lyn, then the binding of Syk to the γ-chain, with resultant Syk activation (14Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 15Melford S.K. Turner M. Briddon S.J. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. J. Biol.

Med. 1998; 188: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Syk activation appears to lie upstream of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2, which releases intracellular calcium (18Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. Vugt M.J. Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). On the other hand, relatively little has been elucidated regarding the GPIa/IIa-mediated signal transduction system. Although the role of GPIa/IIa as a collagen receptor is well established, whether GPIa/IIa also mediates activation signals has remained to be elucidated. Only recently, Kehrel et al. (10Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated that GPVI-deficient platelets showed increased fibrinogen binding in response to collagen but not to CRP. Since collagen but not CRP contains the binding sites for GPIa/IIa, it is suggested that GPIa/IIa also mediates certain activation signals leading to GPIIb/IIIa activation (10Kehrel B. Wierwille S. Clemetson K.J. Anders O. Steiner M. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Okuma M. Barnes M.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 491-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with inhibitors have also suggested that GPIa/IIa can transduce activation signals in platelets; tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk or PLCγ2 induced by collagen was attenuated by pretreatment of anti-GPIa/IIa inhibitory antibodies or integrin β1 (GPIIa)-cleaving metalloproteinase, Jararhagin (19Asazuma N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32599-32605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast to GPVI-mediated platelet activation, there have been few GPIa/IIa agonists appropriate for investigating the GPIa/IIa-related signal transduction pathway. Aggretin, purified from snake venom, is reported to induce platelet aggregation acting as a GPIa/IIa agonist, but its functional property has not been fully elucidated (22Huang T.F. Liu C.Z. Yang S.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). JBS2, an anti-α2 integrin monoclonal antibody (mAb) that promotes collagen binding to T-cells, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 in human platelets. However, when Fcγ receptor II (FcγRII) was blocked by an anti-FcγRII mAb, IV.3, JBS2 did not induce PLCγ2 phosphorylation, suggesting that platelet activation induced by this anti-α2 mAb occurs mainly through FcγRII (20Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26668-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, although it has been well established that GPIa/IIa plays a major role in platelet adhesion to collagen (1Watson S.P. Gibbins J. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Moroi M. Jung S.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it remains unclear what signals GPIa/IIa mediates that finally lead to platelet activation. Recently, we have isolated and characterized a functionally novel platelet agonist, designated as rhodocytin, from the Calloselasma rhodostoma venom (25Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have suggested that rhodocytin belongs to the heterodimeric C-type lectin-like proteins and appears to induce platelet aggregation by interacting with GPIa/IIa (25Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that the GPIa/IIa-mediated signal induces Syk and PLCγ2 activation, similar to GPVI-mediated signals. However, distinct from GPVI-mediated signals, tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 induced by GPIa/IIa stimulation is potently inhibited by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or cytochalasin D treatment. These findings suggest that Syk and PLCγ2 activation requires actin polymerization and that tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 is facilitated by the thromboxane A2 (TXA2)-producing system in the GPIa/IIa-mediated signal transduction pathway. Susceptibility to ASA or cytochalasin D is reminiscent of collagen-induced platelet activation. In this study, we present several lines of evidence to suggest that rhodocytin directly and specifically binds to GPIa/IIa and that this association is independent of divalent cations distinct from other integrin-ligand bindings. Our findings suggest that, upon rhodocytin stimulation, Src that constitutively associate with GPIa/IIa become activated, and several signaling molecules including Cas, Syk, and PLCγ2 undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. It is suggested that clustering of GPIa/IIa is necessary for the GPIa/IIa-mediated signal transduction, since all of these phenomena related to tyrosine phosphorylation are sensitive to cytochalasin D, which blocks actin polymerization. Rhodocytin was purified from the venom of C. rhodostoma as described previously (25Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Anti-GPIa mAbs, 7E10B and 3C8A, were generated by one of us. Briefly, human platelets were used for immunizing 5-week-old Balb/c mice. The hybridomas obtained were screened by the reactivity to human GPIa-transfected Chinese hamster ovarian cells and human osteosarcoma-derived cell line, MG63, which expresses GPIa. Immunoprecipitation study using MG63 confirmed that clones 7E10B and 3C8A react with GPIa. Clone 7E10B is an inhibitory antibody, and clone 3C8A is a nonfunctional antibody, as determined by adhesion assays of platelets to collagen. Liposomes carrying recombinant fragments of GPIa/IIa (rGPIa/IIa liposome) were made by the methods of Staatz et al. (5Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Sepharose beads conjugated with 7E10B were used to purify the GPIa/IIa incorporated liposome. We have confirmed that rGPIa/IIa liposome has more than 90% purity by SDS-PAGE. Anti-GPIa mAb (6F1), anti-CD9 mAb, anti-GPIb mAb (WGA3), and collagen-related peptide (CRP) were kindly donated by Dr. B. S. Coller (Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York), Dr. S.

Venous blood from healthy drug-free volunteers was collected into a tube containing acid/citrate/dextrose (ACD). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained after centrifugation of whole blood at 160 × g for 10 min. When indicated, PRP was incubated with 1 mm ASA for 30 min to exclude the secondary effects of TXA. The platelets were washed twice with 15% ACD and 100 nm PGI2 and resuspended in HEPES buffer containing 138 mm NaCl, 3.3 mmNaHPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 109 cells/ml. Thirty minutes before experiments, the platelet suspension was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl. From FcRγ-chain-deficient C57BL/6 (B6) mice and control B6 mice, blood (500–900 μl) was taken into a 1-ml plastic syringe containing 0.1 ml of ACD by cardiac puncture immediately after the mice died from deep ethyl ether anesthesia. PRP was obtained after centrifugation of whole blood at 160 × g for 10 min. Residual blood after PRP had been removed was further diluted by adding 200 μl of Tyrodes-HEPES buffer (134 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.6). The mixture was centrifuged again, and the supernatant was obtained for the maximum recovery of platelets. After repeating this step several times, PRP was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min in the presence of 100 nm PGI2 and 15% ACD. The platelets were resuspended in Tyrodes-HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, at a concentration of 1.3 × 108 cells/ml. Washed human platelets at a concentration of 2.0 × 108/ml or murine platelets at a concentration of 1.3 × 108 cells/ml were activated by the indicated concentrations of agonists under continuous stirring at 1,000 rpm in a PA-100 platelet aggregation analyzer (Kowa, Tokyo, Japan). When indicated, platelets were pretreated with the indicated concentration of anti-GPIa mAbs, 1 μm PGE1, 5 μm PP1 or 5 μm PP2 at 37 °C for 5 min. The instrument was calibrated with a platelet suspension for zero light transmission and with buffer for 100% transmission. Thirty five μg of purified rhodocytin was covalently coupled to 50 mg of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions. One ml of platelet lysates (3.5 × 109cells) lysed by an equal volume of 2× ice-cold lysis buffer(2% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml of leupeptin) was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was precleared by 100 μl of Sepharose 4B (50% slurry) for 1 h and then was split into two portions. One-half was incubated with 80 μl of rhodocytin-bound Sepharose 4B, and the other half was incubated as the control with 80 μl of Sepharose 4B for overnight. The beads were washed 5 times in 1× lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted from the beads with 40 μl of SDS reducing buffer (19Asazuma N. Yatomi Y. Ozaki Y. Qi R. Kuroda K. Satoh K. Kume S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and were boiled for 5 min. For the preparation of microtiter plates coated with rhodocytin or collagen, 100 μl of the indicated concentrations of rhodocytin or collagen was added to each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate and was left to stand overnight at room temperature. After two cycles of washing with PBS, each well was blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Before use, 1% BSA-containing PBS was heated at 80 °C for 10 min and sterilized by filtration. One hundred μl of rGPIa/IIa liposomes (2 μg/ml) or washed platelet (1 × 104 cells/ml) was then added to each well and incubated at 30 °C for 3 h or 20 min, respectively. With rGPIa/IIa liposome, wells were incubated with biotinylated anti-GPIa mAb (3C8A) after removing unbound rGPIa/IIa liposome. rGPIa/IIa liposome binding was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin and visualized with o-phenylenediamine. The optical density was measured by a microplate reader (NOVAPATH, Bio-Rad). When platelet adhesion was measured, after removing unbound platelet, wells were incubated with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After platelet membranes were lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100, they were stained by 0.1 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin. Cells were viewed under a BH microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed on Fujicolor super G400 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The number of adhered platelet was calculated on the photographs. After platelets were activated with rhodocytin for the indicated time intervals, reactions were terminated with an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C and then mixed with the indicated antibodies. The mixture was rotated for 1–2 h at 4 °C and, after the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads, was further rotated for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1× lysis buffer. SDS reducing buffer was then added to the beads, followed by boiling for 3 min. The proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto Clear Blot Membrane-P. The membranes were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. After extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80, the immunoblots were incubated for 2 h with the indicated antibody. Antibody binding was detected by using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with ECL chemiluminescence reaction reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Konica x-ray film (JX 8 × 10, Konica Co., Tokyo, Japan). Where indicated, levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were quantified using PDI1400oe Scanner and Quantity One 2.5a software for Macintosh. After preclearing, the sample was split into two portions. One-half was used for immunoblotting as described elsewhere, and the other half was processed further for an in vitro kinase assay. For in vitro kinase assay, the beads were washed once with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, 1 mm vanadate, pH 8.0) and then incubated with 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer (300 mm HEPES/NaOH, 15 mm MnCl2, 150 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) with 10 μl of acid-treated enolase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μm ATP (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After 10 min at 20 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and then subjected to boiling for 3 min. The proteins were separated under reducing conditions by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred onto Clear Blot Membrane-P (Atto, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was treated with 1m KOH for 60 min, dried, and visualized with a BAS-2000 PhosphorImager analyzer (Fuji Film, Japan). Where indicated, levels of radioactivity were quantified using PDI1400oe Scanner and Quantity One 2.5a software for Macintosh. We previously reported that echicetin, which is GPIb-blocking snake venom, does not inhibit rhodocytin-induced platelet aggregation, suggesting that rhodocytin induces platelet aggregation independently of GPIb (25Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also showed that rhodocytin induces platelet aggregation with a long lag time and that rhodocytin-induced platelet aggregation is susceptible to ASA and cytochalasin D treatment (26Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since all of these properties are reminiscent of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, we investigated the effect of antibodies directed against GPIa/IIa, which is one of the most important collagen receptors in platelets, on rhodocytin-induced platelet aggregation. A2-IIE10, a mAb directed against GPIa, potently blocked collagen-induced platelet aggregation, whereas Gi9, another mAb directed against GPIa, only partially inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation even at a concentration of 100 μg/ml (Fig.1 A). Rhodocytin (10 nm)-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by 50 μg/ml of Gi9 and was completely inhibited by A2-IIE10 at 25 μg/ml, the concentration that also inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 1 A). Relatively high concentrations of anti-GPIa mAbs required for inhibition of rhodocytin-induced platelet aggregation imply that rhodocytin binds to GPIa/IIa with high affinity. Performed as negative control experiments, none of these anti-GPIa antibodies inhibited platelet aggregation induced by CRP or thrombin (Fig. 1 A). We confirmed that a blocking antibody against integrin-associated protein (B6H12), one of the platelet membrane proteins, had no effect on platelet aggregation induced by rhodocytin, even at a concentration of 100 μg/ml (26Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, IV.3 (anti-FcγRII blocking mAb), at a concentration that could completely inhibit platelet aggregation induced by a FcγRII-activating mAb (NNKY1–19), had virtually no effect on rhodocytin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 1 B). These findings suggest that rhodocytin interacts with GPIa/IIa but not with GPIb or FcγRII. We also examined the effects of an anti-GPIa antibody on the interaction between platelets and immobilized rhodocytin. Washed platelets incubated with A2-IIE10 or control mouse IgG were added to rhodocytin-coated wells. Platelet binding was detected by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. This binding was reduced to 12.5% of the control in the presence of 25 μg/ml A2-IIE10 (data not shown). The fact that anti-GPIa antibody almost completely inhibits the association between platelets and rhodocytin indicates that GPIa/IIa is the major receptor responsible for the rhodocytin-platelet interaction. We investigated whether rhodocytin-mediated platelet aggregation is mediated by GPVI, one of the major collagen receptors. FcRγ-chain, which associates with GPVI is necessary for GPVI-mediated signal transduction, and collagen-related peptide (CRP), which is a specific GPVI agonist, fails to induce aggregation of platelets obtained from GPVI-deficient patients or FcRγ-chain knockout mice (18Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. Vugt M.J. Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 20 nm rhodocytin induced aggregation of platelets obtained from Fcγ −/− mice, whereas CRP up to the concentration of 1 μg/ml failed to do so. In contrast, both rhodocytin and CRP elicited platelet aggregation with Fcγ +/+ mice. These findings suggest that rhodocytin induces platelet aggregation independently of GPVI. Based on the effects of specific mAbs, we have already suggested that rhodocytin induces platelet aggregation by interacting with GPIa/IIa, independently of GPIb (25Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To confirm this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether rhodocytin-coupled beads bound to GPIa/IIa. Sepharose 4B beads were covalently coupled with rhodocytin and added to platelet lysates. Immunoblot analysis showed that rhodocytin-coupled Sepharose 4B beads effectively precipitated GPIa, whereas there was no recovery of GPIa with Sepharose 4B control beads (Fig.3 A). On the other hand, neither rhodocytin-coupled Sepharose 4B beads nor Sepharose 4B beads as a control precipitated GPIb (Fig. 3 B). We could not detect coprecipitation of GPIIa in rhodocytin-coupled Sepharose 4B beads, although an anti-GPIIa antibody detected the presence of GPIIa in whole cell lysates of platelets. These findings suggest that rhodocytin binds to GPIa but not to GPIIa or GPIb. To investigate whether rhodocytin binds directly or indirectly to GPIa (for example, via an unidentified protein which associates with GPIa/IIa), we evaluated the binding of liposomes carrying recombinant fragments of GPIa/IIa (rGPIa/IIa liposomes) to immobilized rhodocytin. As shown in Fig.4, rGPIa/IIa liposomes adhered to immobilized rhodocytin or collagen. This binding was potently blocked by 10 μg/ml anti-GPIa blocking mAbs, 7E10B and Gi9. It is well known that the binding of integrins to their ligands requires the presence of divalent cations. The adhesion of rGPIa/IIa liposomes to collagen was completely inhibited by 10 mm EDTA. To our surprise, EDTA did not inhibit the binding of rGPIa/IIa liposomes to rhodocytin at all. These findings suggest that rhodocytin specifically and directly interacts with GPIa/IIa, independently of divalent cations. We previously reported that rhodocytin-induced GPIa/IIa stimulation elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, subsequent PLCγ2 activation, and intracellular calcium mobilization, which finally leads to platelet aggregation and that these activation signals are inhibited by ASA treatment (26Inoue K. Ozaki Y. Satoh K. Wu Y. Yatomi Y. Shin Y. Morita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that Syk and PLCγ2 were activated even when platelets were pretreated with GRGDS peptides and EGTA, suggesting that this activation is aggregation-independent and that this is not mediated through GPIIb/IIIa (data not shown). In this study, we extended our study to evaluate the effects of PGE1, which increases the intracellular cAMP concentration. As shown in Fig. 5, platelet aggregation, intracellular calcium mobilization, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 were completely inhibited by 1 μmPGE1. Since several parameters of collagen-induced platelet activation are resistant to the elevation of intracellular cAMP (27Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol.

The sequence between −163 and −124, that has been previously defined as a functional promoter element, was used as a bait to screen a human brain cDNA library. Ten cDNA clones that encoded portions of the human Zic1 (five clones) and Zic2 (five clones) transcription factors were isolated. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of a binding site for Zic1 and Zic2 in the −136/−125 region. Displacement of binding with oligonucleotides derived from adjacent sequences within the APOE promoter revealed the existence of two additional Zic-binding sequences in this promoter. These sequences were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutational analysis in regions −65/−54 and −185/−174. Cotransfection of Zic1 and Zic2 expression vector and differentAPOE promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in U87 glioblastoma cell line showed that the three binding sites partially contributed to the trans-stimulation of the luciferase reporter. Ectopic expression of Zic1 and Zic2 in U87 cells also trans-stimulated the expression of the endogenous gene, increasing the amount of apolipoprotein E produced by glial cells. These data indicate that Zic proteins might contribute to the transcriptional activity of the apolipoprotein E gene and suggest that apolipoprotein E could mediate some of the developmental processes in which Zic proteins are involved.

It is a single-chain polypeptide of 299 amino acids, which plays a prominent role in transport and metabolism of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, resulting from its ability to interact with lipoprotein receptors (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the human protein presents two polymorphic sites that generate three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4). The major site of synthesis is the liver, but the protein is also produced in extrahepatic tissues such as adrenals and nervous system. In the rat brain, the synthesis takes place in astrocytic cells (2Boyles J.K. Pitas R.E. Wilson E. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Clin.

In brain, the regulation of this gene remains largely unexplored, despite its importance in processes of degeneration and regeneration of the nervous system. The importance of the regulatory region of the APOEgene in the determination of the apoE levels in the brain is emphasized by the recent identification of a number of polymorphisms within the promoter (31Artiga M.J.

We have initiated a search of possible regulatory proteins that bind to proximal regions of the APOE gene promoter. Previously, we identified the transcription factor AP-2 as a mediator of the cAMP stimulation of apoE synthesis in glial cells (36Garcı́a M.A. Vázquez J. Giménez C. Valdivieso F. Zafra F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7550-7556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we analyze the regulatory region that lies between −163 and −124, a region that contains positive regulatory elements in HELA, HepG2, COS, and U87 cells (23Smith J.D. Melian A.

The following oligonucleotidesTCGGGCTCTATGCCCCACCTCCTTCCTCCCTCTGCCCTGCTGTGC andCCGAGGCACAGCAGGGCAGAGGGAGGAAGGAGGTGGGGCATAGAGC, containing the described previously URE1 region (24Paik Y.K. Chang D.J.

The annealed oligonucleotide displayed overhanging ends (underlined) to promote oriented oligomerization upon ligation in the plasmid pAEA (38Liaw G.J. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 668-670PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment containing five tandem repeats was subcloned into the yeast reporter plasmids, pHISi-1 and pLacZi (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), yielding plasmids APOE1-pHIS-1 and APOE1-pLacZi, respectively. The reporter constructs were subsequently linearized and sequentially integrated into the yeast strain YM4271. Yeast were transformed first with APOE1-pLacZi, followed by APOE1-pHIS-1. Transformants selected on leu−, ura− minimal medium were used as a dual reporter host yeast strain for the library screen. The host yeast strain was transformed with a MATCHMAKER human brain cDNA library constructed in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) by the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method. Approximately 5 × 104 transformants were plated per 150-mm dish containing his− leu− minimal selective medium supplemented with 15 mm 3-aminotriazole. Approximately 2.5 × 106 cDNA plasmids were screened. Based on large colony size and rapid growth, a total of 19 positive clones were selected. These clones were tested for β-galactosidase activities using the filter replica method. Ten clones showed strong blue color compared with the host strain. Plasmids were recovered from His+/LacZ+ colonies by transformation into DH5α cells. The plasmids were partially sequenced and the nucleotide sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank™/EMBL data bases using the Fasta program. To produce histidine-tagged Zic1 and Zic2 proteins (His-Zic1 and His-Zic2), we prepared bacterial expression constructs for both proteins. First, the Zic-encoding cDNA inserts from the pGAD10 cloning vector, isolated after the one-hybrid procedure, were transferred into the BamHI/BglII sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHisA (Invitrogen Inc, San Diego, CA). Then, Escherichia coli BL21 strain was transformed with the expression constructs and grown in LB culture medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 70 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside for 5 h. Bacteria were collected and lysed by sonication in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmimidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml lysozime. Fusion proteins were purified with Ni-NTA resins (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) using a batch protocol as recommended by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Recombinant transcription factors (0.5–1 μg) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer 5 mm (Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with 2 μg/assay poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)). Where indicated, competitor oligonucleotides were included during the preincubation period. Labeled oligonucleotide (1 ng/binding reaction; 100,000–200,000 cpm) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The incubation mixture was electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at constant voltage (100 V) for 3–4 h. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. The luciferase reporter plasmid pXP2 (39Norden S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) was used to harbor different fragments of the APOEpromoter. The fragments were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides from the desired regions as primers and the APOE-pCRII construct (36Garcı́a M.A. Vázquez J. Giménez C. Valdivieso F. Zafra F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7550-7556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. Amplified fragments were ligated to the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the identity was confirmed by sequencing. Fragments were subcloned in the MCS of pXP2, in front of the luciferase reporter gene. Mutation were introduced by PCR by using mutant oligonucleotides as described (40Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Mouse Zic1 and Zic2 expression vectors were prepared by cloning the full-length genes into the pEBOS vector as described. 2K. Mizugishi, J. Aruga, K. Nakata, and K. Mikoshiba, submitted for publication. U87 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The day before transfection, confluent cells were subcultured by trypsinization and 1–3 × 104 cells/well were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates. For transient transfections, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/well by the calcium phosphate method using the CalPhos™ mammalian transfection kit (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For stable transfection U87 cells were transfected by electroporation with Zic cDNAs cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 that carries the neomycin resistance gene for selection. After selection with 0.2 g/liter G418 for 12–15 days, single colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders. Clones stably transfected were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.2 g/liter G418. Cells were harvested on day 2 following transfection with 150 μl of a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100. Unsolubilized material was removed by 2 min of centrifugation, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of the extracts were determined. Luciferase was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) by incubation of 40 μl of cell extract with 90 μl of luciferase assay reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase was determined in a 96-well microtiter plate by incubating 20 μl of cellular extract with 20 μl of a solution containing 3 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Absorbance at 405 nm was determined in a microplate reader. Total RNA was extracted from U87, Zic1-U87, Zic2-U87, SW1088, or HepG2 cell lines as described (42Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Expression of mRNAs for apoE, Zic1, Zic2, and GADPH was analyzed by RT-PCR by using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) as recommended by the manufacturer. Oligo(dT)16 was used for the first strand cDNA syntheses. The following oligonucleotides were used in the PCR amplification steps: APOE F, GCATGCTCCTGGACGCCGGAC; APOE R, GGAGCCTGCGACGTGAAGGCTGT; Zic1 F, GCATGCTCCTGGACGCCGGACC; Zic1 R, GGAGCCTGCGACGTGAAGGCTGT; Zic2 F, GCATGCTTCTGGACGCGGGGCC; Zic2 R, CTCTGACCAGGAGACAGTTCGT; GADPH F, CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA; GADPH R, TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC. The resultant cDNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV illumination. Cells grown to confluence were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and SDS-PAGE was performed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were transferred by electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a semidry electroblotting system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nonspecific protein binding to the blot was blocked by incubation of the filter with 3% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The blot was probed with anti-apoE antibody (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) diluted 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the blot was probed with a peroxidase-linked anti-goat IgG. Bands were visualized with the ECL detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We are interested in identifying transcription factors that could regulate the expression of the APOE gene in the nervous system. The yeast one-hybrid system was used to screen for human brain cDNAs encoding for proteins that bind to sequences of the APOE promoter located upstream of the TATA box, a region of the promoter that has been previously shown to contain a number of functional promoter elements (23Smith J.D. Melian A. Leff T. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8300-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Paik Y.K. Chang D.J. Reardon C.A. Walker M.D. Taxman E. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9496-9504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five tandem copies of the sequence spanning −163 to −124 were cloned upstream of a minimal GAL4 promoter either in pHIS1 or in pLacZi reporter plasmids and integrated into the yeast genome of YM4271 (his3, leu2). A hybrid expression library (MATCHMAKER) consisting of human brain cDNAs fused to the GAL4 activation domain was then screened to identify proteins that bound to the APOE promoter and activated HIS3 transcription from the reporter construct. Transformants growing on selective medium were assayed for β-galactosidase expression. After screening 2.5 million independent colonies, 10 transformants produced strong blue color on filter assay after 1 h of incubation in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Plasmids of these transformants were then recovered and sequenced. Sequence analysis indicated that five clones corresponded to different portions of the transcription factor Zic1 and five to the closely related Zic2. The longest Zic1 clone lacked regions encoding the 72 amino acids of the amino terminus as well as 10 amino acids in the carboxyl end of the open reading frame of the human gene. The longest Zic2 clone spans from amino acid 182 to 530. Both clones contained the respective zinc finger domains and were in frame with the activation domain of GAL4. To confirm the presence of a Zic-binding site in theAPOE gene promoter, we first produced His-tagged Zic1 and Zic2 proteins by transferring the Zic-encoding inserts from the yeast vector pGAD10 to the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHisA. The recombinant proteins were then purified with nickel-containing resins. The binding activity of the recombinant proteins was assayed by EMSA with the 32P-labeled, double-stranded bait oligonucleotide (bp −163 to −124). We detected the formation of stable complexes of this DNA fragment with both His-Zic1 and His-Zic2, but not with control bacterial extracts (Fig. 1). The binding of His-Zic1 was specifically competed by increasing amounts of the unlabeled bait oligonucleotide (−163/−124) (Fig.2, lanes 5–7). Interestingly, the binding was also competed by double-stranded oligonucleotides derived from adjacent regions of the APOE promoter spanning bp −70 to −40 and bp −188 to −169 (Fig. 2 , lanes 2–4and 8–10), suggesting the existence of additional Zic1 binding elements in the promoter. The binding was not displaced by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides −39/+1 and −113/−80 (data not shown) or by an unrelated oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lane 11). Identical results were obtained by using His-Zic2 (data not shown).

Fragments labeled with an asterisk formed stable complexes with His-Zic1 and His-Zic2 in EMSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine more precisely the nucleotide sequence required for binding of Zic proteins, a number of double-stranded 20-mers included within the displacing oligonucleotides were synthesized and assayed in EMSA experiments. DNA-protein complexes were only observed when we used the DNA fragments labeled with an asterisk in Fig. 2, and these were selected for further mutational analyses. Various substitution mutations were introduced within these oligonucleotides, and then used in EMSA experiments. Fig. 3 shows results of mutagenesis in DNA fragment −143/−124. Mutation in the 5′ end of this fragment produced a marked decrease in His-Zic1 binding with respect to control, although the retarded DNA-protein complex was clearly detectable (Fig. 3, lane 2). However, when bases from −136 to −125 were exchanged in groups of three for adenine, binding of His-Zic1 was severely impaired and the retarded complexes were undetectable (lanes 3–6). Similar results were obtained when His-Zic2 was used in the assays (data not shown). These experiments define the binding site for Zic proteins within the initial bait. Binding sequence was also investigated within the DNA fragment spanning −69 to −50. As shown in Fig.4, binding of both His-Zic1 and His-Zic2 was disrupted by mutations in bases located between −65 to −54 (lanes 3–6 and 10–13). Mutations in bases −69 to −66 and −50 to −53 had a weaker effect on binding of both proteins (lanes 2, 7, 9, and14) as compared with the respective controls (lanes 1 and 8). Finally, another site was defined for both recombinant proteins within the DNA fragment −188/−169. Mutations in positions between −185 and −174 completely abolished the formation of retarded complexes (Fig. 5, lanes 3–6 and 10–13), whereas mutations in bases −173 to −171 produced a weaker reduction of binding (Fig. 5,lanes 7 and 14). In summary, the three binding sites described above were termed Zic-BS1 (−65/−54), Zic-BS2 (−136/−125), and Zic-BS3 (−185/−174), according to their positions with respect to the transcriptional starting point.Figure 4Mutational analysis of −69/−50 region of the APOE promoter.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR)1 is a prototype of the class of receptors that constitutively enter cells via clathrin-coated pits and traffic the endocytic pathway, recycling between early endosomal compartments and the cell surface (2Stockert R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 591-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Two subpopulations of ASGR, States 1 and 2, were originally identified based on the kinetics of ligand transport and the identification of parallel endocytic pathways (3Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Changes in both the phosphorylation (4Haynes P.A. Medh J.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33152-33158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acylation (5Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27186-27190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) status of the receptor have been suggested to affect the transition between these states. The existence of receptor subpopulations has also been suggested for other class II recycling receptors, including the low density lipoprotein, mannose 6-phosphate, and α2-macroglobin receptors (6Weigel P.H. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 19: 125-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A mutant affecting endocytic traffic (TRF1) was previously isolated from HuH-7 cells using a dual selection protocol (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To avoid the selection of receptor-minus mutants, selection pressure was applied against two independent cell-surface receptors. Gelonin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was covalently coupled to two glycoproteins with oligosaccharide chains terminating in either galactose (asialoorosomucoid (ASOR)) or mannose (ovalbumin) and simultaneously delivered to mutagenized HuH-7 cells. The mutation expressed by TRF1 cells reduces the surface expression of several unrelated membrane proteins and provides genetic evidence for the existence of receptor subpopulations. Due to a selective redistribution of State 2 receptors in TRF1 cells, the surface binding of ASOR was reduced by 50% and that of transferrin by 30% compared with parental HuH-7 cells. Anterograde steps of intracellular endocytic processing of ASOR, including internalization, endosomal acidification, and ligand degradation, were not significantly altered by the TRF1 mutation. The pleiotropic phenotype of TRF1 cells also results in a marked increase in sensitivity to Pseudomonas toxin (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of this sensitivity to expression-clone a cDNA that complements the TRF1 mutation. The cloned gene, designated CK2α“, is 91% identical to the CK2α isoform. Transfection and overexpression of either the novel CK2α” isoform or the previously described CK2α isoform restore the parental phenotype to TRF1 cells. This study provides the first evidence that CK2 plays a significant role in ASGR trafficking between an intracellular compartment and the plasma membrane. The origin of the HuH-7 and TRF1 human hepatoma cell lines was described previously (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The HuH-7 neomycin-resistant cell line was isolated following transfection with pRc/RSV (Invitrogen) DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HuH-7 Zeocin-resistant and TRF1 neomycin-resistant cell lines were isolated following electroporation of ∼2 × 106 cells with 10 μg of pZeoSV2(+) (Invitrogen) or pRc/RSV DNA in a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser II with a capacitance setting of 975 microfarads and a voltage setting of 0.3 kV. To generate somatic cell hybrids, ∼1 × 106 cells of each line were plated in a 35-mm tissue culture dish in 2 ml of α-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS. The following day, the medium was removed, and the plates were washed once with 1.5 ml of α-MEM without serum. Cells were fused by exposure for 1 min to a 44% solution of polyethylene glycol 1000 in serum-free α-MEM. The monolayers were then washed four times with 1.5 ml of serum-free α-MEM and once with 1.5 ml of α-MEM containing 10% FBS. Two ml of medium with serum was then added to each plate. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, cells were removed by treatment with 5 mm EDTA in PBS without divalent cations, and 2 × 105 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in 10 ml of α-MEM containing 10% FBS. After an additional 48 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 and 400 μg/ml Zeocin. Plates were returned to a 37 °C incubator and examined for the presence of colonies weekly. Small colonies, generally observed within 3 weeks, were subcloned at 8–10 weeks, and the cultures were gradually expanded. Hybrids formed between the HuH-7 neomycin-resistant and HuH-7 Zeocin-resistant cell lines at a frequency of ∼5 × 10−3. In the case of the TRF1 neomycin-resistant and HuH-7 Zeocin-resistant fusion partners, a lower frequency of 3 × 10−4 was observed. Few, if any, colonies were observed in the absence of polyethylene glycol treatment Hybrid colonies were removed from flasks or dishes by washing with 5 ml of PBS without divalent cations, followed by treatment with 2 ml of 5 mm EDTA in PBS without divalent cations. Clumps of cells were disaggregated by four passages through a syringe fitted with a 20-gauge needle. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were transferred to centrifuge tubes and pelleted at 1200 rpm for 10 min in an IEC HN-SII centrifuge. The cell pellet was washed once with 5 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1% sodium citrate-phosphate (pH 7.8) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). After a 10-min incubation on ice, ploidy was estimated by determining the DNA content of single cells by FACS analysis using a Becton-Dickinson FACScan cytometer. HuH-7 mRNA was isolated using a QIAGEN mRNA isolation kit, and an HuH-7 expression library was prepared in the pBK-CMV vector system by Stratagene. To isolate plasmid DNA for transfection, the cDNA library was amplified by transformation of competent cells (XLI, Stratagene) and selection on LB/kanamycin plates. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the cells were harvested, and plasmid was prepared using a QIAGEN maxiprep kit. The sensitivity of cells to toxins was determined essentially as described previously (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were removed from nearly confluent T-75 flasks by treatment with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, and diluted to 8 × 104 cells/ml. A range of Pseudomonas toxin (Sigma) concentrations was prepared in the same medium, and 0.1 ml was added to the wells of a 96-well plate, followed by 0.1 ml of cells (8 × 103). Cells were incubated at 37 °C until the control wells (without toxins) reached confluence. The concentration of each toxin required to kill 90% of the cells (D10 value) was determined by a methylthiazolyltetrazolium assay. Ten 100-mm plates of TRF1 cells grown to 80% confluence in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS were transfected with the HuH-7 library (4 μg/plate) using a LipofectAMINE Plus kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, G418 (200 μg/ml) was added, and the cells were cultured for 2 weeks. The surviving colonies were cultured for another 2 weeks in medium containingPseudomonas toxin (0.2 ng/ml) and G418 (200 μg/ml) until the cells transfected with the pBK-CMV vector alone died.Pseudomonas toxin-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAGEN QIAamp kit, and the integrated plasmid cDNA was retrieved by polymerase chain reaction using T3/T7 primers. The DNA Sequencing Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine performed sequence analysis of the cDNAs. The two most resistant clones to Pseudomonas toxin had identical cDNA sequences. Comparison with the NCBI Database showed the sequence to be 91% identical to the α-subunit of human CK2. As there already exists a CK2α′ isoform (8Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we termed this new isoform CK2α“. The polymerase chain reaction-recovered cDNA encoding CK2α“ was cloned back into the expression vector pBK-CMV, and the fidelity of the resulting construct (pBK-CMV-CK2α”) was established by DNA sequencing. Clones of the human CK2α subunit were kindly provided by Dr. David W. Litchfield (University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). The cDNA was cloned in the pRC-CMV expression vector with a hemagglutinin tag (9Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The plasmids pBK-CMV-CK2α“ and pRC-CMV-HA-CK2α were transfected into TRF1 cells using a LipofectAMINE Plus kit. The G418-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. A post-nuclear supernatant fraction was prepared by the method of Tyc and Steitz (10Tyc K. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 107) were scraped into 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 ×g. After resuspension in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubation on ice for 15 min, the cells were disrupted by 15 strokes with a tight-fitting pestle. The cell homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 ×g, and the protein concentration was determined in the supernatant fraction by bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates were prepared by direct suspension of cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passage 20 times through a 21-gauge needle. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were used for protein assay and Western blotting. A peptide containing 16 amino acids near the carboxyl terminus from amino acids 366 to 381 of CK2α“ (LLSSTVYPPWPPKVL) was synthesized with a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus as a linker. The Laboratory of Macromolecular Analysis at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine performed peptide synthesis and verification. This cysteine-terminating peptide was linked to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Covance Research Products, Inc. raised antibody to the peptide in rabbits. Forty μg of protein from post-nuclear supernatants or cell lysates was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS/Tween buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% dry milk. The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in one of the following rabbit anti-human CK2 antibody preparations: anti-CK2α subunit antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted to 1 μg/ml, CK2α and CK2α′ isoform-specific antibody diluted 1:5000 (kindly provided by Dr. David W. Litchfield), or CK2α“ isoform-specific antibody diluted 1:3300 in TBS/Tween containing 2% dry milk. The membrane was washed five times for 5 min each time and incubated for 30 min in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum diluted 1:5000 in TBS/Tween containing 1% dry milk. After washing five times for 5 min each time with TBS/Tween, the membrane was incubated for 20 s in chemiluminescence reagents (Super Signal-Pierce) and exposed to Fuji film. To determine the specificity of rabbit anti-CK2α” antibody, a mixture of 1 μg of CK2α“ peptide, 3 μl of anti-CK2α” antibody, 200 μl of PBS was rotated overnight at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 10 ml of TBS/Tween containing 2% nonfat dry milk before use. Band intensities were determined by scanning films used for chemiluminescent detection. Cells grown to confluence in 60-mm dishes were washed two times with binding buffer (135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 27.8 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)). Following washing, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To assay surface binding, cells were chilled to 4 °C and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml 125I-ASOR in 1.5 ml of binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined from dishes that also contained 100 μg of unlabeled ASOR. Unbound ligand was removed by three washes with binding buffer, and surface-bound125I-ASOR was released by incubation for 10 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of 20 mm EGTA in TBS (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L.

Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The presence of functional gap junction channels was directly assessed by both cell-to-cell transfer of Lucifer yellow, a small molecular mass fluorescent dye (<1 kDa), and communication of mechanically induced intercellular Ca2+ waves. Cells were injected with Lucifer yellow (5% in 150 mm LiCl) until they glowed brightly through microelectrodes using hyperpolarizing pulses or brief overcompensation of the negative capacitance control on a World Precision Instruments electrometer as described previously (12Stockert R.J. Spray D.C. Gao Y. Suadicani S.O. Ripley C.R. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Hertzberg E.L. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were photographed 1–2 min after dye injection using a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a xenon arc lamp configured for epifluorescence using barrier and excitation filters optimized for detection of fluorescein emission. Exposure times using TMAX 200 film were usually 20–30 s. Dye transfer was evaluated as the number of contacting cells receiving dye from the injected cell. Intracellular free Ca2+ levels were measured in cells grown to confluence on glass-bottom microwells (Model 15, Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA) and loaded at 37 °C for 45 min with 5 μm Indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a radiometric Ca2+ indicator. After rinsing with PBS, Indo-1 fluorescence was imaged using an argon ion laser with excitation at 351 nm and emission at 400 and 480 nm. Images were acquired using the Nikon real-time confocal microscope (RCM8000) and analyzed as described previously (12Stockert R.J. Spray D.C. Gao Y. Suadicani S.O. Ripley C.R. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Hertzberg E.L. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The intercellular propagation of Ca2+waves was initiated by brief, gentle focal mechanical stimulation of one cell in the confocal field using a pulled-glass micropipette (1–2-μm outer diameter). Indo-1 fluorescence ratio values were plotted as a function of time, and graphs were fit with least-squares polynomial regression as described previously (12Stockert R.J. Spray D.C. Gao Y. Suadicani S.O. Ripley C.R. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Hertzberg E.L. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two parameters of Ca2+ wave propagation were used for comparison of the Ca2+ signaling between cells: efficacy (the number of responding cells in the field) and conduction velocity (the time required for half-maximal Ca2+ increase divided by the distance from the stimulated cell). Cells (1 × 106) preincubated at 37 °C in phosphate-free MEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS for 1 h were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (250 μCi/ml) for 3 h in the same medium. Following labeling, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and centrifuged at 300 ×g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of water to which 2× lysis buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, and 2% Nonidet P-40 containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 4 μm okadaic acid) was added and maintained at 4 °C for 30 min with constant mixing, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Antiserum to human ASGR was added to supernatants containing equal amounts of32P-labeled proteins as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, immobilized protein A/G (Pierce) was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Immobilized protein A/G recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g was washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and than a final wash with PBS. Antigen released by heating to 95 °C for 3 min was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained and fixed. The dried gels were exposed to Biomax film with an intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. Prior to expression cloning, it was determined whether the TRF1 mutation is expressed as a dominant or recessive phenotype. HuH-7 and TRF1 cells were stably transfected with plasmids encoding genes for either neomycin or Zeocin antibiotic resistance. Cell lines resistant to each antibiotic were isolated and fused by exposure to polyethylene glycol 1000. Hybrid cells (HuH-7×HuH-7 or HuH-7×TRF1) were selected for resistance to both antibiotics. After subculturing, cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by FACS to determine DNA content. As would be expected, hybrid cells contained approximately twice as much DNA as parental cell lines (Fig.1). The hallmark of the mutation expressed by TRF1 cells is the reduction in cell-surface expression of several unrelated membrane proteins, including ASGR (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Restoration of cell-surface ASGR binding activity in the HuH-7×TRF1 hybrid would be consistent with a normal receptor distribution and suggest that the TRF1 mutation is recessive. The binding of 125I-ASOR was used to estimate the number of bioactive ASGRs at the cell surface. Both hybrid cell lines exhibited somewhat greater cell-surface 125I-ASOR binding activity than TRF1 cells or the antibiotic-resistant parental lines (Fig. 2). Based on this result, theTRF1 mutation was presumed recessive, and a cDNA library was derived from HuH-7 mRNA for expression cloning a complementary cDNA that corrected the TRF1 phenotype. Our previous observation that TRF1 cells are 10 times more sensitive toPseudomonas toxin than the parental HuH-7 cell line (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggested that complementation of the TRF1 mutation could be selected for by resistance to Pseudomonas toxin. From preliminary experiments, it was found that, although the difference in sensitivity to Pseudomonas toxin was constant, the absolute concentration required to kill >90% of the cells varied depending on the source and age of the Pseudomonas toxin preparation. To determine the amount of Pseudomonas toxin to use for selection, a sensitivity assay was preformed on TRF1 and HuH-7 cells. Cells were plated in 96-well dishes, exposed to increasing concentrations of Pseudomonas toxin, and cultured until control cells reached confluence. The concentration at which ∼90% of the cells were killed was determined by a methylthiazolyltetrazolium assay as described previously (7Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For this particular preparation ofPseudomonas toxin obtained from Sigma, 0.2 ng/ml killed 90% of the TRF1 cells, whereas 90% of the HuH-7 cells survived (Fig.3). An HuH-7 expression cDNA library constructed in pBK-CMV was prepared by Stratagene using mRNA isolated from HuH-7 cells. Stable transfectants (1 × 105/plate) were obtained from 10 plates of TRF1 cells (1 × 107/plate) transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA from the HuH-7 library. The surviving colonies on each plate were pooled and subjected to selection with 0.2 ng/mlPseudomonas toxin. After 14 days of selection, G418-resistant colonies from pBK-CMV vector-only-transfected cells were dead, whereas 15 clones survived from the library-transfected cells. Of the surviving clones, two were as resistant to Pseudomonas toxin as the parental HuH-7 cell line (>50% cell viability at 0.5 ng/mlPseudomonas toxin). The other 13 clones exhibited intermediate levels of toxin resistance (<50% cell viability at 0.3 ng/ml Pseudomonas toxin). Transfected cDNA was retrieved from the two clones by polymerase chain reaction with T3/T7 sequence primers using genomic DNA as template. Sequence analysis indicated that the two transfectants harbored the same cDNA encoding a protein with 91.2% amino acid identity to the human CK2α subunit. The new CK2α isoform obtained from HuH-7 cells, termed CK2α“, has 1507 nucleotides with an open reading frame encoding 385 amino acids (Fig.4). The cDNA sequence of CK2α” is 65.2% identical to CK2α cDNA. The differences between CK2α and CK2α“ are mainly localized to the C terminus. From amino acids 1 to 353, there is only one amino acid substitution in the derived protein sequence (Thr to Ala at position 127, due to a single nucleotide difference, A to G). After amino acid 353, the predicted protein sequences of CK2α” and CK2α are totally different. Despite this difference, when CK2α“ was expressed inEscherichia coli, cell lysates exhibited a kinase activity equal to that of bacteria transformed with the CK2α cDNA using a synthetic peptide (RRKDLHDDEENDAMSITA) as substrate (13Vilk G. Saulnier R.B. St. Pierre R. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14406-14414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The unique CK2α” sequence has previously been reported within clone RP5–863C7 (gi:5788437) as an intronic repeat region (14Dunham I. Shimizu N. Roe B.A. Chissoe S. Hunt A.R. Collins J.E.

Although the genomic structure of CK2α“ has not been established, the presence of a translated commonly dispersed repeat or Alu cassette and the remnants of a poly(A) tail in the cDNA recovered from the original revertants suggest that CK2α” is either a CK2α-derived retroposon (16Mighell A.J.

Genomics. 1994; 19: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using antibody against the common region of CK2α and CK2α“ (amino acids 70–91 of the CK2α subunit) indicated that TRF1 cells expressed 40.6 ± 2.7% of the total CK2α isoforms expressed by HuH-7 cells (Fig.5 A). Consistent with these findings, the hybrid cell lines HuH-7×HuH-7 and HuH-7×TRF1, which exhibited a similar level of cell-surface ASOR binding activity as the parental HuH-7 cell line (Fig. 2), expressed equivalent levels of CK2α and CK2α” (Fig. 5 B). Analysis using antibodies against peptides unique to CK2α and CK2α′ indicated that TRF1 cells expressed amounts of CK2α and CK2α′ comparable to the parental HuH-7 cell line (Fig. 6). The predicted molecular mass of CK2α“ was equivalent to that of the CK2α subunit and could not be by resolved from CK2α on SDS-PAGE. To determine the expression of CK2α” in HuH-7 and TRF1 cells, a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a specific region of the C terminus of CK2α“ was prepared. CK2α” expression by HuH-7, TRF1, and CK2α“-transfected TRF1 cells was determined by immunoblot analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 6, only HuH-7 and TRF1 cells transfected with CK2α” expressed a 44-kDa protein, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of CK2α“, whereas TRF1 cells expressed no such protein.Figure 6Expression of CK2 α isoforms in HuH-7, TRF1, and CK2 α“-transfected TRF1 cells.

Because several human diseases arise from defects in protein folding, the activity of hsc70 chaperones is a potential therapeutic target for these disorders. By using a known hsc70 modulator, 15-deoxyspergualin, as a seed, we identified a novel inhibitor of hsc70 activity. This compound, R/1, inhibits the endogenous and DnaJ-stimulated ATPase activity of hsc70 by 48 and 51%, respectively, and blocks the hsc70-mediated translocation of a preprotein into yeast endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomal vesicles. Biochemical studies demonstrate that R/1 most likely exerts these effects by altering the oligomeric state of hsc70.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). Specifically, by binding exposed hydrophobic patches in newly translated proteins, hsc70s maintain secreted proteins in a translocation-competent state and facilitate proper protein folding by preventing aberrant interactions. hsc70s also participate in the quality control process that identifies mis-folded proteins and targets them for degradation (reviewed in Refs. 2Brodsky J.L. McCraken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar and 3Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In addition, hsc70s interact with specific native proteins to modulate their oligomeric state or their interaction with various cofactors (reviewed in Refs. 1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar,4Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem.

Binding and release of polypeptide substrates by hsc70s is governed by the coordinated actions of their nucleotide- and substrate-binding domains. Polypeptides interact transiently with the substrate-binding domain of ATP-bound hsc70. This interaction stimulates ATP hydrolysis, which results in a conformational change in the substrate-binding domain that increases its affinity for peptide (6Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 7McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the exchange of ADP for ATP on hsc70, bound peptides are released and the cycle repeats. Members of the DnaJ family of molecular co-chaperones stimulate ATP hydrolysis and promote peptide binding, in some cases by delivering specific substrates to hsc70 (8Wickner S. Hoskins J.

Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Recent structural and genetic studies indicate that DnaJ chaperones interact with the ATPase domain at a site near or coincident with the peptide-binding domain of hsc70 (10Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11Suh W.-C. Burkholder W.F. Lu C.Z. Zhao X. Gottesman M.E. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), the modulation of hsc70 and DnaJ chaperone activity may be used to combat these disorders. In addition, cellular hsc70 is co-opted by viral oncogenes to induce cellular transformation (14Srinivasan A. McClellan A.J. Vartika J. Marks I. Cantalupo P. Li Y. Whyte P. Rundell K. Brodsky J.L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7871-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying novel hsc70-regulating compounds could prove beneficial. One hsc70-interacting compound is 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG1; see Fig. 1). DSG binds hsc70 (KD = 4 μm) and stimulates its ATPase activity (18Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B. Mazzucco C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We recently found that DSG stimulates the steady-state ATPase activity of bovine and yeast cytosolic hsc70s by 42 and 22%, respectively, but has no effect on BiP/Kar2p, an hsc70 that resides in the lumen of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (19Brodsky J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, DSG prevents neither the DnaJ-mediated stimulation of hsc70 ATPase activity nor the ability of hsc70 to bind (and release) peptide substrates in vitro, even though DSG is hydrophobic and resembles a peptide (19Brodsky J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Nadler S.G. Eversole A.C.B. Tepper M.A. Cleaveland J.S. Ther.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DSG is currently being examined as an immunosuppressive agent. The ability of DSG to reduce tissue rejection in transplant patients may occur through the inhibition of macrophage function and induction of cytolytic T and B cells (22Hughes S.E. Gruber S.A. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because the immunosuppressive effects of some DSG analogs correlate with their binding affinity for hsc70 (21Nadeau K. Nadler S.G. Saulnier M. Tepper M.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,23Lebreton L. Jost E. Carboni B. Annat J. Vaultier M. Dutartre P. Renaut P. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4749-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these activities are thought to be mediated at least in part by the ability of DSG to modulate the activity of hsc70 (18Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B. Mazzucco C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), In addition, a recent study suggests that DSG could be the prototype of a new class of drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Addition of DSG to cells expressing a mutant form of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ΔF508-CFTR) enhances the plasma membrane cAMP-stimulated chloride current (24Jiang C. Fang S.L. Xiao Y.-F. O'Conner S.P. Nadler S.G. Lee D.W. Jefferson D.M. Kaplan J.M. Smith A.E. Chen S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that DSG dissolves a fraction of the hsc70-ΔF508-CFTR complexes that are trapped in the ER. Similarly, Rubenstein and Zeitlin (25Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: 259-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that phenylbutyrate decreases the cellular concentration of hsc70-ΔF508-CFTR complexes, resulting in a rescue of the ΔF508-CFTR defect. To identify new and potentially more reactive chemical entities with hsc70-perturbing effects, we searched the Developmental Therapeutics Program data base at the National Cancer Institute for DSG-related compounds. In this study we report the analysis of a compound with some structural similarities to DSG. This compound, NSC 630668-R/1 (designated R/1), inhibits hsc70 ATPase activity and hsc70-mediated protein translocation in vitro. The structure of DSG (7-guanidinoheptanoic acid {[4-(3-aminopropylamino) butylcarbamoyl]hydroxymethyl} amide) and its GI50 activities in the 60 cell line antitumor screen performed by the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer Institute were used as seeds to probe for compounds with similar attributes using the web-based version of the COMPARE algorithm. In activity-activity comparisons, six compounds with pairwise correlation coefficients of ≥0.8 were found. NSC 630668-R/1 ({6-[6-(5-ethoxycarbonylaminocarbonyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2 H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-hexyloxycarbonylamino]hexyl}carbamic acid 6-(5-ethoxycarbonylaminocarbonyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2 H-pyrimidin-1-yl)hexyl ester) bore some structural resemblance to DSG (see Fig. 1) and was thus selected for biochemical analyses. R/1 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a final concentration of 12.2 mm and was stable at 4 °C for at least 1 month. A 3 mm dilution of the 12.2 mm stock in Me2SO was prepared before each experiment to avoid precipitation of R/1 upon addition to aqueous solvents. Ssa1p, BiP, and Ydj1p were purified as described previously, and ATPase measurements were performed using published methods (26Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) except that steady-state reactions containing R/1 were preincubated 15 min on ice before the addition of radiolabeled ATP. For single turnover ATPase assays, R/1 was added to buffer before the addition of ATP-Ssa1p complex, and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. The synthesis and import (translocation) into ER-derived vesicles of an unglycosylated form of yeast prepro-α-factor (ΔGppαF) was performed essentially as described (30McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In brief, translocation reactions were assembled with ΔGppαF, yeast ER-derived microsomes, and R/1 or Me2SO and preincubated on ice for 30 min before the addition of an ATP-regenerating system. Import reactions were performed at 20 °C for 40 min and split, and half was treated with trypsin at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml for 30 min on ice to determine the extent of membrane-enclosed, signal sequence-cleaved substrate. All samples were treated with trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by autoradiography. The integrity of microsomal membranes in the presence of R/1 was assessed by trypsin accessibility to BiP and translocated yeast ΔGppαF. For BiP protection experiments, mock translocation reactions were assembled with equal volumes of R/1 (to a final concentration of 300 μm), Me2SO, Triton X-100 (to a final concentration of 1%) or with Buffer 88 (20 mmHEPES (pH 6.8); 150 mm KOAc; 5 mm MgOAc; 250 mm sorbitol). Following a 45-min incubation at 20 °C, translocation reactions were split, and one-half was treated with trypsin at a final concentration of 0.35 mg/ml for 60 min on ice. All samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with anti-BiP antibody (31Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antiserum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the SuperSignal West Chemiluminescence system from Pierce. For analysis of translocated pro-α-factor, translocation reactions were performed in the absence of R/1. Subsequently, the reactions were spun at 13,000 rpm in a Sorvall Biofuge Pico microcentrifuge for 2 min at 4 °C, washed with 1 volume of Buffer 88, and spun again as above before being resuspended in the same volume of Buffer 88. The reactions were divided into thirds, and equal volumes of R/1 (to a final concentration 300 μm), Me2SO, or Triton X-100 (to a final concentration of 1%) were added. Typsin-treated and untreated reactions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and loaded onto an 18% urea/SDS-polyacrylamide gel (30McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, dried, and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis using the MacBas software program (version 2.4) from Fuji Photo Film Inc. The indicated proteins were incubated for 15 min on ice in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); 50 mm NaCl; 100 mm dithiothreitol; 2 mm MgCl2; 50 μm ATP) with equal volumes of Me2SO or R/1 (at a final concentration 300 μm) in a total volume of 30 μl. The reactions were then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g (40,000 rpm) for 1 h at 4 °C in a TLS-55 Beckman rotor. Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver nitrate staining. BiP and Sse1p were purified in the Brodsky laboratory (28McClellan A.J. Endres J.B. Vogel J.P. Palazzi D. Rose M.D. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B.

Malate synthase, lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, and citrate synthase were purchased from Sigma. The therapeutic and biochemical properties of DSG prompted us to search for additional DSG-like compounds that could modulate hsc70 activity. One compound, R/1 (Fig.1), gave a pairwise correlation coefficient of 0.801 using the COMPARE algorithm (see “Materials and Methods”). A sample of R/1 was consequently obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer Institute. To determine whether R/1, like DSG, could modulate hsc70 function, the steady-state ATPase activity of purified Ssa1p, a yeast cytosolic hsc70 chaperone, was measured in the presence and absence of R/1. At 300 μm, the concentration at which DSG maximally stimulated Ssa1p (19Brodsky J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), R/1 caused a 48% decrease in the specific activity of Ssa1p, from 1.25 nmol·min−1·mg−1in the absence of R/1 to 0.65 nmol·min−1·mg−1in its presence (Fig. 2). Purified Ydj1p, the cytosolic DnaJ partner of Ssa1p (27Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), increased the specific activity of Ssa1p 6.2-fold in this experiment, a result consistent with previously published data (14Srinivasan A. McClellan A.J. Vartika J. Marks I. Cantalupo P. Li Y. Whyte P. Rundell K. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4761-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Cyr D.M.

Cell. 1998; 9: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Addition of R/1 decreased the Ydj1p-mediated stimulation of Ssa1p from 9 to 4.4 nmol·min−1·mg−1, a 51% reduction (Fig. 2). Thus, R/1 compromises the endogenous and DnaJ-stimulated ATPase activity of Ssa1p. We next titrated the effect of R/1 on Ssa1p ATPase activity. In this assay, half-maximal levels of inhibition were achieved at ∼100 μm R/1 (Fig. 3). R/1 also inhibited the ATPase activity of BiP in a dose-dependent manner, similar to its effect on Ssa1p (Fig. 3). The post-translational translocation of preproteins into the ER is an ATP-dependent, chaperone-mediated process that can be recapitulated in vitro using yeast ER-derived microsomes. In yeast, two hsc70s are involved in this process; Ssa1p binds unfolded polypeptides in the cytosol to retain them in a soluble, translocation-competent state (34Chirico W.J. Waters M.G. Blobel G. Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 35Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R.

Schekman R. Cell. 1999; 97: 679-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ssa1p and BiP interact with specific DnaJ homologs, Ydj1p and Sec63p, respectively, both of which are also required for post-translocational translocation (26Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 31Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J.

To assess the effect of R/1 on this chaperone-mediated process, we examined the efficiency with which an in vitro translated yeast pre-pheromone, prepro-α-factor (ppαF), was translocated into yeast ER-derived microsomes in the presence of increasing concentrations of R/1. Translocation of ppαF into microsomes was assessed by cleavage of the signal sequence of ppαF to form pro-α-factor (pαF) and by the subsequent resistance of pαF to trypsin digestion due to its membrane enclosure. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, we found that translocation was almost completely blocked at 300 μm, and the half-maximal level of inhibition occurred at ∼6 μm. Because R/1 is relatively hydrophobic, it might have prevented translocation by solubilizing microsomal membranes. To exclude this possibility, we examined the trypsin accessibility of two lumenal proteins, BiP and translocated pαF, after the addition of R/1 to microsomes. Both proteins remained resistant to trypsin after treatment with R/1 or Me2SO (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and 6; Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and 5) but were degraded by trypsin when microsomes were permeabilized with detergent (Fig.5 A, lane 8, and 5 B, lane 6). These results indicate that R/1 does not prevent translocation by destroying microsome integrity. Steady-state ATPase assays measure the ability of a chaperone to bind, hydrolyze, and rebind ATP. Thus, to determine whether R/1 specifically affects ATP hydrolysis, we performed single turnover experiments on pre-formed ATP-Ssa1p complexes. This allows measurement of initial rates of hydrolysis and is therefore more sensitive than steady-state experiments. As shown previously (29Sullivan C.S. Tremblay J.D. Fewell S.W. Lewis J.A. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), hydrolysis of Ssa1p-bound ATP is rapid (Fig.6). Surprisingly, when R/1 was included in the reaction, the initial rate of hydrolysis dramatically increased. At 300 μm R/1, the initial rate of ATP turnover was ∼5-fold higher than that for the reaction without R/1, an increase comparable to that seen by addition of peptide substrates to other hsc70s (38Davis J.E. Voisine C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9269-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although previous experiments performed in our laboratory demonstrated that 95% of the Ssa1p-ATP complex can be hydrolyzed (29Sullivan C.S. Tremblay J.D. Fewell S.W. Lewis J.A. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the rate of ATP hydrolysis leveled off after ∼4 min in the presence of R/1, suggesting that a fraction of Ssa1p became inactivated by R/1. At lower R/1 concentrations where translocation was compromised (Fig.4), the rate of ATP hydrolysis was again enhanced (2.5- and 4.5-fold at 10 μm and 30 μm R/1, respectively), but after 2 min, the rate of hydrolysis decreased (Fig. 6). These data indicate that R/1 compromises Ssa1p ATPase activity at concentrations as low as 10 μm, thus providing an explanation for the inhibition of in vitro translocation at this concentration (Fig. 4). King et al. (39King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 235-22540Google Scholar, 40King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12452-12459Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) previously found that a rapid burst of ATP hydrolysis, mediated by the Ydj1p co-chaperone, induces the formation of metastable Ssa1p polymers. Because R/1 similarly affects Ssa1p activity (Fig. 4), one scenario for the R/1-mediated inhibition of Ssa1p ATP hydrolysis is that R/1 oligomerizes Ssa1p. To test this hypothesis, the amount of hsc70 that precipitates after centrifugation at 100,000 × g in the presence and absence of R/1 was examined. In control reactions, ∼30% of Ssa1p and BiP precipitated, whereas in the presence of 300 μm R/1, 60–70% of Ssa1p and BiP were found in the pellet (Fig.7). Interestingly, similar results were observed with yeast Sse1p, a member of the hsp110 family of molecular chaperones that is 27% identical to Ssa1p (41Mukai H. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Gething M.J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein-folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 76-77Google Scholar). To determine whether the ability of R/1 to precipitate proteins was a general phenomenon, we examined several other proteins in this assay. In the presence of R/1 the amount of precipitable malate synthase was only enhanced ∼15% (Fig. 7). Similarly, R/1 had a lesser effect on the amounts of lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, and citrate synthase than on the amounts of the Ssa1p, BiP, and Sse1p chaperones found in the pellet after centrifugation (Fig. 7). To confirm the chaperone specificity of R/1, the ability of malate synthase to catalyze the formation of (2 S)-malate from acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate in the presence and absence of R/1 was assayed as described (42Durchschlag H. Biedermann G. Eggerer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found that the specific activity of malate synthase was 0.57 and 0.62 μmol·min−1·mg−1in the presence of Me2SO and 300 μm R/1, respectively. We report here on the identification of the first specific inhibitor of posttranslational protein translocation. Single turnover experiments show that hsc70 ATP hydrolysis is initially stimulated but inhibited at later time points, presumably by hsc70 precipitation and inactivation. This property is specific for the chaperones examined as R/1 failed to precipitate several other proteins to the same degree. The ability of R/1 to inhibit translocation does not arise from the increase in trypsin-resistant ppαF observed (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) as ∼26% of ppαF became resistant at 60 μmR/1, and translocation was inhibited by ∼90% at this concentration. Therefore, we conclude that the abrogation of ppαF translocation is most likely mediated by the ability of R/1 to inhibit the activities of two hsc70s, Ssa1p and BiP, that are required to engineer preprotein transport into the yeast ER (31Brodsky J.L. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 33Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13791-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for the effect of R/1 on hsc70 is that the length and hydrophobic nature of R/1 (Fig. 1) enable it to mimic a peptide substrate. This would explain the initial burst of ATP hydrolysis observed in the single turnover experiments (Fig. 6) and the inhibition of posttranslational translocation (Fig. 4) if R/1 competes effectively with ppαF for occupation of the substrate-binding site of Ssa1p and/or BiP. Alteration of the oligomeric state of hsc70 could result indirectly from precipitation of hsc70-bound R/1 molecules (Fig.7). Alternatively, R/1 might promote the formation of hsc70 polymers by binding to a site on hsc70 distinct from that which interacts with peptides. Support for the latter hypothesis derives from the observation that DnaJ homologs can polymerize hsc70 in the absence of substrate (39King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 235-22540Google Scholar, 40King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12452-12459Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may arise from hsc70 homopolymer formation. In the absence of a substrate, hsc70s may bind one another to form metastable polymers (40King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12452-12459Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the initial burst of ATP hydrolysis caused by R/1 could promote the formation of hsc70 polymers, which in turn would inhibit ATP hydrolysis of existing ATP-Ssa1p complexes. Despite their structural similarity (Fig. 1), there are several differences in the activities of DSG and R/1. First, DSG stimulates the steady-state ATPase activity of Ssa1p (19Brodsky J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas R/1 inhibited Ssa1p steady-state activity. Second, DSG inhibits neither the ATPase activity of BiP (19Brodsky J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) nor the posttranslational translocation, 2J. L. Brodsky, unpublished results. in contrast to R/1. Third, although R/1 may be a peptide mimic (see above), DSG does not appear to interact with the substrate-binding domain of hsc70 as it does not prevent Ssa1p or mammalian hsc70 from binding polypeptide substrates (19Brodsky J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Nadler S.G. Eversole A.C.B. Tepper M.A. Cleaveland J.S. Ther. Drug Monit. 1995; 17: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, there is no evidence that DSG inactivates or alters the oligomeric state of hsc70. Thus, DSG and R/1 probably modulate hsc70 activity by distinct mechanisms. Our discovery of a small molecule that is capable of inhibiting a hsc70-mediated, DnaJ-stimulated process is profound. Because molecular chaperones influence the biogenesis and degradation of many medically relevant protein substrates (2Brodsky J.L. McCraken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 13Thomas P.J. Qu B.-H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), R/1 and R/1 analogs could prove to be therapeutically valuable. Future studies will be directed toward identifying and characterizing these compounds.

Stimulation and coordination of mitochondrial gene expression from these two sites is accomplished by the nuclear respiratory factors, NRF-1 and NRF-2 (1Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,2Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Using electrical stimulation to produce hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiac myocytes, the transcriptional activation of cytochrome c is preceded by induction of NRF-1 mRNA (3Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with NRF-1 induction as a prerequisite for synthesis of respiratory chain components. These basic insights into cellular factors that link nuclear events to mitochondrial gene activation are critical for adaptation to environmental stresses and the necessity for enhanced energy production. In contrast to subcellular coordination of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory chain synthesis, less is known concerning tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of nuclear encoded genes involved in energy metabolism. These genes are particularly important in cardiac muscle where contractile activity must be supported by a high rate of aerobic ATP production. There are examples of muscle- or heart-specific mitochondrial proteins that contain sites for ubiquitous transcription factors as well as striated muscle-specific motifs in the proximal promoter, e.g. muscle-specific cytochrome oxidase genes (4Lenka N. Vijayasarathy C. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 309-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increases in contractile activity induced by electrical stimulation of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in culture results in increased mRNA levels of the striated muscle-specific, energy-metabolizing enzymes, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I β (CPT-Iβ)1 (3Xia Y. Buja L.M. Scarpulla R.C. McMillin J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11399-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and adenylate-succinate synthase I, a component of the purine nucleotide cycle (5Xia Y. McMillin J. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CPT-Iβ (the muscle isoform) has been cloned and is the predominant isoform in rat heart and the sole enzyme expressed in skeletal muscle (6Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CPT-Iα is expressed in most tissues, including the heart. The latter isoform is present at very low levels in the adult cardiac myocyte and is absent in skeletal muscle (6Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CPT-I is an example of an enzyme for which the isoforms are very different kinetically. The muscle isoform exhibits an affinity for carnitine that is at least an order of magnitude higher in Km and a KI for malonyl-CoA that is an order of magnitude lower than the KI measured for CPT-Iα (6Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). High expression of the muscle isoform of CPT-I is characteristic of adult heart, so that this particular isoform appears adapted for efficient derivation of energy from long chain fatty acids in an active contracting myocyte. Very little is known about the heart-specific elements that drive transcription of CPT-Iβ in heart. Recent work has demonstrated the presence of a fatty acid response element (FARE) in the human CPT-Iβ promoter (7Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). After exposing neonatal rat cardiac myocytes to serum-free conditions, addition of exogenous oleate increases expression of the human CPT-Iβ reporter gene 8–20-fold and CPT-Iβ mRNA levels rise 4–5-fold (7Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and the retinoid X receptor act to activate CPT-Iβ through the FARE site. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α may also play a pivotal role in the expression of enzymes of β-oxidation (8Djouadi F. Brandt J.M. Weinheimer C.J. Leone T.C. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 339-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The physiological impact of fatty acid induction of CPT-Iβ in heart is less certain since cardiac CPT-I is resistant to fasting, a condition that enhances serum fatty acid concentrations (9Mynatt R.L. Lappi M.D. Cook G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Cook G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12030-12033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that factors that increase expression of tissue specific proteins involved in contractility and energy-utilizing reactions in heart would also be important in regulating the expression of an enzyme involved in transformation of its major energy substrate, long chain fatty acids. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that CPT-Iβ is regulated by the muscle-specific factor, GATA-4, and by combinatorial interactions between GATA-4 and the nuclear factor, serum response factor (SRF). Interaction between MADS box and C4 zinc finger proteins represents a novel coregulator mechanism of the cardiac actin promoter (11Belaguli N.S. Sepulveda J.L. Nigam V. Charron F. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7550-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). SRF is especially abundant in embryonic and adult cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle cells (12Arsenian S. Weinhold M. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A.

The recent homologous recombinant knockout of the murine SRF gene locus demonstrated that SRF is absolutely required for the appearance of mesoderm and muscle lineages during mouse embryogenesis (12Arsenian S. Weinhold M. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The identification of CPT-Iβ as a GATA-4-dependent gene that is coactivated by SRF is the first suggestion that this paradigm may represent an important mechanism by which expression of cardiac specific genes is synchronized between subcellular compartments. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (16McMillin J.B. Hudson E.K. Buja L.M. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 2: 301-309Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (Primeria, Fisher), and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, CellGro, Fisher) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.). The cells were incubated at 37o in the presence of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 36 h before transfection. Myocytes were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation in the presence of serum as described previously (18Wang D. Harrison W. Buja L.M. Elder F.F.B. McMillin J.B. Genomics. 1998; 48: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate precipitate contained 1.0 μg of CPT-Iβ firefly luciferase vector and 0.25 μg of a CMV-driven Renilla luciferase expression vector (Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. Six hours following transfection, the myocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in DMEM with serum for an additional 48 h. For treatment with oleic acid, the myocytes were transfected with the CPT-Iβ (−318/+80) reporter gene and maintained in DMEM + serum for 12 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free DMEM ± 0.5 mm oleate (2:1 molar ratio oleate:bovine serum albumin) for an additional 24–30 h. CV-1 monkey kidney fibroblasts (ATCC no. CCL-70) were maintained as above but were trypsinized 24 h before transfection and plated to reach 85% confluence by the start of the experiment. CV-1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent system (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free medium. After 3 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh serum-containing medium for 48 h. Cotransfections included 1.0 μg of the wild-type, truncated, or mutant CPT-Iβ firefly luciferase reporter constructs and various combinations of the following CMV expression vectors: 0.4 μg of Nkx2.5, 0.4 μg of GATA-4, 0.1 μg of SRF, 0.1 μg of SRF-ΔC, and 0.1 μg of SRF-pm. Total DNA for each transfection was corrected to a final concentration of 2.0 μg by addition of empty CMV vector. Total protein in each well was measured using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). CPT-Iβ firefly luciferase was corrected for protein and normalized to that of the CMV/Renilla expression for each separate experiment. Nuclear extracts from primary rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (17Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Schaffer W. Matthius P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6420Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA probes containing sequences from the rat CPT-Iβ promoter were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA) as shown in Table I. EMSA reaction mixtures included 2–15 μg of nuclear extract, 25 mmHepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 50 ng of poly(dI·dC) as a nonspecific competitor in a 20-μl reaction volume. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 0.3 ng of radiolabeled probe was added and the reaction incubated for 20 min. When included, specific antibodies (Santa Cruz) or 100-fold molar excess of cold probe was added during the first incubation. Protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 25 °C.Table IOligonucleotides for EMSA and reporter gene analysisSITE (position)Gel shift oligonucleotidesEMSA mtQuick change primers (forward)Sp1 (−68 to −74)ctagcgaggacagggcggggccgggcagggTTcgggcccagtgaggacagAAcAgAgTcgggcaggggtggcGATA (−93 to −96)ctagcagtgggtatcaagttcccagtgagCCtcgggagtgggCGtcaagttcccagtgaggCArG (−104 to −112)ctagctttctccaccccaatttgggagt-gggtatgAcaGttCgActgttttctccacccGcaGtCtgCgagtgggtatc-aagttcccGATA (−126 to −129)ctagccgcccatatctgttttctccgGGtccccgcccaGGtctgttttctccaccccEbox (−247 to −252)ctagcaccatgctcacgtgagaccctcgcGcgCAatgcaaccatgctcGcgCAagaccctccctMEF2 (−271 to −280)ctagctacattcagctatttttagcact-gatggctatGtttaCccctacattcagctatGtttaCcactgatgcaacc-atgcFARE (−303 to −289)ctagcgactcctggtgaccttttccct- acattcagcgtggCgacAttCtccGtactcctggCgacAttCtccGtacattcagcDouble-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized for use in DNA EMSAs.

Construction of the rat CPT-Iβ promoter fragment −391/+80 has been reported previously (18Wang D. Harrison W. Buja L.M. Elder F.F.B. McMillin J.B. Genomics. 1998; 48: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The expression vector pCMV-Nkx 2.5 was a gift from Dr. Janet Mar. Construction of the expression vectors for pCGN-SRF, pCGN-SRFpm, pCGN-SRFΔC, and pCDNA3-GATA-4 has been described (15Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A series of CPT-Iβ promoter constructs with the 5′ end between −315 and −31 and the 3′ end from −1 to +80 were created by PCR amplification from the plasmid template, −361/+80. Specific primers were designed with an artificial restriction site and the desired region of the rat CPT-Iβ promoter. For deletion of the MEF2 region contained in the −306/+80 construct, 10 bp (−281 to −270) were deleted from the artificial primer. The PCR products were restricted and cloned into the multiple cloning site of the promoterless firefly luciferase vector, pGL3 basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The inserted CPT-Iβ fragment in each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Renillaexpression vector, pRL, was purchased from Promega. Mutations were introduced to the −391/+80 CPT-I construct with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, high performance liquid chromatography-purified primers containing the desired mutation were used in concert with the high fidelity polymerase Pfu-turbo for PCR amplification of the −391/+80 plasmid. Wild-type template was digested with DpnI, and the remaining mutated product was transformed into Escherichia coli and sequenced for correct insertion of the mutant primer. Specific quantitative assay of rat CPT-Iβ was performed using real time PCR (7700 Prism, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on hydrolysis of a specific fluorescent probe at each amplification cycle by the endonuclease activity of Tac polymerase as described previously (19Depre C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M. Stepkowski S. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 11: 1269-1275Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The sequence for the muscle-specific CPT-I was obtained from GenBank™ (accession no. D43623, nucleotide numbers 869–889 (forward primer) and 932–952 (reverse primer)). The level of transcripts for the constitutive housekeeping gene product, cyclophilin, was quantitatively measured for each sample to control for sample-to-sample differences in RNA concentrations. The PCR data are reported as the number of transcripts per number of cyclophilin mRNAs (19Depre C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M. Stepkowski S. Davies P.J.A. Taegtmeyer H.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 11: 1269-1275Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the reported values represent the mean of three to five separate cultures ± standard error. The significance of the differences was determined using Student's t test for nonpaired and paired variates (SigmaPlot statistics software). A region within 391 bases 5′of the first exon is sufficient to drive the heart-specific expression of the CPT-Iβ luciferase reporter gene (18Wang D. Harrison W. Buja L.M. Elder F.F.B. McMillin J.B. Genomics. 1998; 48: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By normalizing the −391/+80 reporter construct to 1.00, the ratio of the larger genomic fragment, −1188/+80, to −391/+80 is 0.93 ± 0.075. Therefore, we conclude that the promoter elements that regulate CPT-Iβ expression to the heart are within 390 bp of the transcription start site. A FARE was located in the rat gene at −303 to −296. When 0.5 mm oleic acid (2:1 molar ratio with bovine serum albumin) was added to serum-free medium and neonatal cardiac myocytes cultured for 24–30 h, CPT-Iβ/luciferase expression was increased from 0.63 ± 0.02 relative luciferase units (in the absence of oleate) to 1.88 ± 0.02 in the presence of oleate. Partial deletion of this region (Δ bases −301 to −293) resulted in a diminished fatty acid effect, i.e. 0.80 ± 0.01 relative luciferase units (in the presence of oleate) from 0.65 ± 0.06 (in the absence of oleate). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of this region (Table I) demonstrated binding of myocyte nuclear protein to this site, and this binding was competed by 100- fold excess of cold oligonucleotides and antibodies to the binding factor COUP-TF (20Sack M.N. Disch D.L. Rockman H. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6438-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but not by mutant oligonucleotides (data not shown). To map the regions in the CPT-Iβ gene that influence expression of the luciferase reporter construct, −391/+80 was progressively deleted from the 5′ end and analyzed for luciferase expression following transfection into neonatal cardiac myocytes (Fig.1). Compared with the full-length −391/+80, deletion of 85 bp to −306/+80 produced minimal changes in luciferase expression. Deletion of the MEF2 site within the −306/+80 reporter gene resulted in an overall decrease in luciferase expression of 34%. With further deletion of the 5′-flanking sequence to −270/+80, luciferase expression progressively decreased by 60%. Subsequent deletion of a consensus E box (−252/−247) led to a significant (85%) enhancement of luciferase expression. In the presence of neonatal cardiac myocyte nuclear protein, EMSA analysis of the −252 E box demonstrated a shift (Table I) that was competed by 100× wild-type oligonucleotide, but not by 100× mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 2). The shift was supershifted by antibodies to either USF1 or USF2 and supershifted to a higher molecular weight complex in the presence of both antibodies (Fig. 2 A). The data suggest that the −252 E box interacts with USF1 and USF2 and may function as a suppressor of CPT-Iβ. Deletion of 165 bp of flanking sequence diminishes full-length CPT-Iβ expression by 50% (−126/+80). This truncation removed one Sp1 site at −136/−131 and a GATA site at −129/−126; deletion of 15 more bp containing a CA box (−117/−112) resulted in a dramatic decrease in reporter gene expression by 90%. Further deletion resulted in partial restoration of activity and an extended deletion produced a minimal promoter containing an Sp-1 site at −74/−68 (Fig. 1).Figure 2Identification of specific transcription factors binding to the CPT-1β promoter.Protein binding to sequences in the CPT promoter was characterized by gel-mobility shift assay. Oligomers containing binding sites from the CPT-1 promoter were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with neonatal rat heart-myocyte, nuclear-protein extracts (see ”Experimental Procedures“). Unlabeled competitor oligomers or antibodies were included as indicated above each lane. A, labeled oligomers corresponding to Ebox −252 incubated with rat myocyte nuclear extract (RMNE) and 2 μl of either USF1 or USF2 antibodies or 1 μl of each for a total of 2 μl. B, sequences representing MEF2 −280 incubated with 4 μg of RMNE and MEF2A antibody (2 μl) or with TNT proteins (1 μl of final TNT reaction). C, labeled probes for the Sp1 −74 binding site incubated with 10 μg of RMNE and 2 μl of either Sp1 or Sp3 antibody. D, Labeled oligomers representing GATA-129 and GATA-96 sites incubated with 10 and 15 μg of RMNE, respectively; GATA4 antibodies added as indicated. E, labeled probes for the SRE-112 binding site incubated with 5 μg of RMNE; SRF antibody (2 μl) added as shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine potential regulatory elements in the context of the intact promoter, mutations were targeted to known sequences contained in the deletion constructs that appear to serve as regulators of CPT-Iβ expression. The mutated constructs were transfected into neonatal cardiac myocytes for measurement of luciferase expression. In agreement with the deletion data, mutation of the MEF2 site (−280/−271) produced a 46% decrease in reporter gene activity (Fig.3). Gel mobility-shift assays were conducted to examine nuclear protein binding to double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to −280/−271 in the CPT-Iβ gene. Two bands were shifted and were identical in mobility to TNT-produced proteins corresponding to MEF2C and MEF2A (Fig. 2 B). Both bands were competed by 100× wild-type but not 100× mutant oligomers (Fig. 2 B), and both were supershifted by antibodies to MEF2. These data suggest that cardiac specificity of CPT-Iβ expression is partly conferred by the presence of a MEF2 site at the distal end of the promoter construct. Although mutation of the Sp1 (−137/−131) did reduce CPT-Iβ expression by 60%, mutations in the CA box (CACCC) at −117/−112 and the Sp1 site (−74/−68) produced strong repression of luciferase expression, i.e. 75% and 76%, respectively (Fig. 3). These data suggest that factors binding to these sites are most likely to be responsible for basal transcription of the CPT-1β gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of the oligomer containing the −74/−68 region demonstrated two bands, both of which were competed by wild-type oligonucleotide but not by mutant oligomers (Fig.2 C and Table I). Similarly, antibodies to Sp1 and Sp3 abolished formation of the protein/DNA complex (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that Sp1 and Sp3 proteins bind to the proximal promoter at −74/−68 and may also play a role in binding to the CA box at −117/−112 (21Zhao J.L. Austen K.L. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A region flanked by the two Sp1 sites at −137/−131 and −74/−68 contains a cluster of potential cardiac regulatory elements including two GATA binding sites, an SRE, and one potential Nkx site (−94/−88) that partially overlaps with a second GATA binding motif at −96/−93. Mutation of the SRE (−112/−104) results in a 56% decrease in CPT-Iβ expression in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3). Serum withdrawal for 44 h dramatically decreases the mRNA concentration of CPT-Iβ in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 4). This decrease in mRNA content is reversed by replacement of serum-free DMEM with media containing 10% bovine calf serum (Fig. 4), supporting a role for serum-containing factors in the up-regulation of CPT-Iβ transcription. Mutation of either GATA site results in a 43–38% decrement in gene expression (−129/−126 and − 96/−93, respectively), whereas mutation of both sites (double GATA mutant) causes a slightly greater fall in luciferase activity (55%). The binding of SRF to the SRE (−112/−104) and GATA-4 to the two potential GATA sites at −96/−93 and −129/−126 was confirmed by EMSA (Fig. 2,D and E). Mutation of the Nkx site (−94/−88) has no effect on reporter gene expression in cardiac myocytes (Fig.3). Although homeodomain factors achieve specificity via protein binding to DNA, Nkx, SRF, and GATA-4 have been demonstrated to exert regulatory control over cardiac gene expression via protein-protein interactions (11Belaguli N.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To study biological activity of these proteins independent of DNA binding, Nkx, GATA-4, and/or SRF expression vectors were cotransfected into CV-1 cells with the full-length CPT-Iβ reporter gene construct. Transfection of Nkx 2.5 or SRF alone produces modest expression of CPT-Iβ/luciferase in CV-1 cells (∼4-fold activation, Fig. 5). Cotransfection of Nkx and SRF with the promoter gene construct produces additive effects on luciferase expression (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that both factors contribute independently to CPT-Iβ gene activation. GATA-4 transfection alone stimulated CPT-Iβ 36-fold, making GATA-4 the most potent tissue-specific regulatory element thus far described for this gene. Cotransfection of GATA-4 and Nkx 2.5 with the CPT-Iβ reporter construct diminished the response of the CPT-Iβ gene to this combination of factors (Fig. 5 B). An additive effect would be predicted if both factors were acting independently. It is possible that Nkx/GATA4 protein-protein interactions (22Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol.

However, overexpression of its proto-oncogene counterpart (INV-Xmrk) is not sufficient for the oncogenic function of the receptor. Compared with INV-Xmrk, the ONC-Xmrk receptor displays 14 amino acid changes, suggesting the presence of activating mutations. To identify such activating mutations, a series of chimeric and mutant receptors were studied. None of the mutations present in the intracellular domain was found to be involved in receptor activation. In the extracellular domain, we found two mutations responsible for activation of the receptor. One is the substitution of a conserved cysteine (C578S) involved in intramolecular disulfide bonding. The other is a glycine to arginine exchange (G359R) in subdomain III. Either mutation leads to constitutive dimer formation and thereby to activation of the ONC-Xmrk receptor.

Their enzymatic activity is tightly regulated in normal cells. After ligand binding and dimerization, they become activated and a cascade of phosphorylations is initiated inside the cells (1Ullrich A. Schessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4605) Google Scholar). Diverse mechanisms have been reported that can lead to the constitutive activation of these enzymes. These comprise overexpression, amplification, point mutations, truncations, and autocrine stimulation. The inappropriate constitutive activation of the RTKs results in an altered signaling inside the cell and is a widely documented process implicated in tumor formation (2Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 3Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The hereditary melanoma of Xiphophorus fish is a well established genetic model system for tumor development in which the overexpression of the RTK gene Xmrk( X iphophorus melanomareceptor kinase) leads to melanoma formation (for review, see Ref. 4Schartl M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 185-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Xmrk belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, but it is an additional member, clearly distinct from the four receptors (HER1–4) already described in mammals (5Wittbrodt J. Adam D. Malitschek B. Mäueler W. Raulf F. Telling A. Robertson S.M. Schartl M. Nature. 1989; 341: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). 2A. Gómez, unpublished data.2A. Gómez, unpublished data. Two copies of the Xmrk gene have been found. One of them, INV-Xmrk, is a gene invariably present in all fish (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J. Altschmied J. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 3A. Gómez, M. Schartl, C. Winkler, and Y. Hong, unpublished data.3A. Gómez, M. Schartl, C. Winkler, and Y. Hong, unpublished data. It is ubiquitously expressed at low levels, and, although its physiological role is still unknown, it appears not to be involved in melanoma formation. It represents the proto-oncogenic form of Xmrk. The second oncogenic copy, ONC-Xmrk, is only present in some species of Xiphophorus. It originated by an ancient gene duplication event from INV-Xmrk and it is under a different transcriptional control than the proto-oncogene. Only basal levels of expression are observed if the regulatory locus R is also present in the genome. This is the situation found in nonhybrid wild fish, which are generally tumor-free. In hybrids, due to crossing conditioned elimination of the R-containing chromosome (7Ahuja M.R. Anders F. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 1976; 20: 380-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the system is deregulated and ONC-Xmrk is overexpressed (8Adam D. Mäueler W. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to neoplastic transformation of pigment cells. A cell line (PSM) derived from Xiphophorus melanoma provides an in vitro system where ONC-Xmrk is also overexpressed. Here, as in melanoma in situ, the Xmrk receptor is highly activated, which is apparent as strong tyrosine autophosphorylation (9Malitschek B. Wittbrodt J. Fischer P. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schartl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10423-10430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Wellbrock C. Geissinger E. Gómez A. Fischer P. Friedrich K. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3047-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fact that the highly expressed ONC-Xmrk is constitutively autophosphorylated in melanoma cells pointed to overexpression, and thus high concentration of receptors, as one mechanism for activation. However, the ectopic overexpression of INV- and ONC-Xmrk in embryos of transgenic fish showed that exclusively those fish expressing ONC-Xmrk were developing tumors with high incidence, short latency periods, and a specific pattern of affected tissues, whereas only a basal rate of tumor induction appeared in the case of INV-Xmrk-expressing fish, comparable to the rate obtained with the expression of another, nonactivated receptor (6Dimitrijevic N.

Schartl M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1517-1525PubMed Google Scholar). Besides that, INV-Xmrk was shown to be not phosphorylated when transiently expressed in human cells (HEK293), in contrast to the strong autophosphorylation of ONC-Xmrk. The different behavior of INV- and ONC-Xmrk clearly indicates that a mechanism additional to overexpression is instrumental in Xmrk activation (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J. Altschmied J. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the two versions of Xmrk revealed that the oncogene differs from the proto-oncogene in 14 residues, including some that are highly conserved in the EGFR family of RTKs and that are present in INV-Xmrk but substituted in ONC-Xmrk (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J. Altschmied J. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This fact suggested that mutational alteration could be involved in the activation of Xmrk. Moreover, the high phosphorylation level shown by an ONC-INV chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of ONC-Xmrk and the intracellular domain of INV-Xmrk pointed to one or more of the mutations in the extracellular domain as implicated in the activation (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J. Altschmied J. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this result did neither address a role of the intracellular mutations in the activation of Xmrk nor could it identify the extracellular oncogenic amino acid change. To understand the mechanism of activation of ONC-Xmrk, we have analyzed the effect of different mutations. We show that two mutations in the extracellular region of the ONC-Xmrk receptor are responsible for activation. Both of them independently lead to the constitutive dimerization of the receptor by aberrant intermolecular disulfide bonding formation. Additionally, the presence of these mutations slows down the processing of Xmrk receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is apparent as an incomplete glycosylation. 5E.2 (anti-Tyr(P)) is a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against phosphotyrosines (12Fendly B.M. Winget M. Hudziak R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1550-1558PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-mrk is a polyclonal antibody raised against ONC-Xmrk (9Malitschek B. Wittbrodt J.

The INV-ONC chimera was generated by replacing an Eco RI fragment from pRK5 ONC (pRK5 Xmrk; Ref. 13Wittbrodt J. Lammers R. Malitschek B. Ullrich A. Schartl M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4239-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) containing the extracellular, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane domains from the ONC-Xmrk receptor with an INV-Xmrk fragment corresponding to the same domains (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J. Altschmied J. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). AnEco RI-Eco 47III and anEco 47III-Sal I fragment from ONC-Xmrk were used to replace the corresponding fragments in pRK5 INV and thus generate the Xmrk(G359R,P388T) and Xmrk(P470L,S476N,C578S,M595I) chimeras, respectively. The different point mutations were created using a Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (version 2, Bio-Rad). Different fragments of INV- or ONC-Xmrk cloned in pBlueScript were used as templates. The following primers were used to generate the mutations: 5′-GAAGGATCCGATGTTGGTTG-3′ for the Xmrk(P388T) mutant, 5′-GGACCTGATGTTGGTCGAGTTG-3′ for the INV(G359R) mutant, and 5′-TGCACACTTCGAGCAGTTGG-3′ for the Xmrk (P470L,S476N,M595I) mutant. The INV(C578S) mutant was generated by replacing a Cpo I-Nsi I fragment from INV-Xmrk by the corresponding one from ONC-Xmrk containing the C578S mutation. All constructs containing point mutations were sequenced to ensure that the desired mutation was present. Three clones from a X. maculatus cosmid library were used as templates for sequencing the mutations. Cosmid L11 091 contains the X-ONC-Xmrk allele, M08 036 contains the Y-ONC-Xmrk allele, and G01 008 contains INV-Xmrk (14Nanda I. Volff J.-N. Weis S. Körting C. Froschauer A. Schmid M. Schartl M. Chromosoma. 2000; 109: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides designed from introns 4, 8, 9, 11, and 14 were used as sequencing primers. Cycle sequencing was performed using a Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence of these cosmid clones revealed the existence in INV- and ONC-Xmrk of an additional codon in positions 1744 and 1573, respectively. This leads to the insertion of a glycine between Trp-512 and Pro-513. Therefore, the amino acid positions higher than 512 are increased by 1 as compared with the numbers published by Dimitrijevicet al. (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J.

The INV- and ONC-Xmrk sequences in the GenBank™ data base with accession numbers U53471 for INV-Xmrk and X16891 for ONC-Xmrk have been updated accordingly. HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney fibroblasts) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected using a modified calcium phosphate transfection method (15Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). For the transfections, 1 μg of plasmid DNA encoding each expression construct was used per 2.3-cm dish and 3–10 μg per 9-cm dish. Following overnight transfection the medium was changed. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Ba/F3 (mouse pro-B-cell line; Ref. 16Palacios R. Steinmetz M.

After harvesting, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in Triton lysis buffer as described (17Wellbrock C. Fischer P. Schartl M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were done by using protein A-Sepharose and anti-Xmrk serum. Immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were electophoresed through a 6.5% or 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel or a 3–8% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. Laemmli buffer either containing or lacking 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples to be run under reducing or nonreducing conditions, respectively. The separated proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using standard protocols. Filters were blocked for 5 min in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5% Tween, 1.5% BSA and incubated 1 h with the first antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibodies were used and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. When necessary, the filters were stripped in 62.5 mmTris-Cl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 50 °C, following three washes with PBS before blocking with 1.5% BSA previous to the second probing. Equal amounts of protein extracts were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in a digestion buffer containing 50 mm tribasic sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 0.5% SDS, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to half of the extracts, and all were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. Digestion products were analyzed on Western blots detected with an anti-Xmrk antibody. 105 BaF INV-ONC or BaF ONC cells were suspended in 500 μl of ice-cold PBS and spun onto slides at 220 × g for 5 min using a cytospin device (Hettich). After removal of the liquid, cells were consecutively fixed for 10 min at −20 °C in methanol and for 2 min at −20 °C in acetone. The fixed cells were then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with anti-mrk serum (40 μg/ml) for 60 min. After washing, another incubation with dichlorotriazinaminofluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova; 30 μg/ml) for 60 min followed. Cells were embedded in mounting medium containing DAPI (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). From an earlier study (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J. Altschmied J. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it was known that the activation of ONC-Xmrk is due not only to overexpression but also to one or several mutations located in the extracellular domain of ONC-Xmrk that might contribute to the oncogenic potential of the receptor. It was shown that an ONC-INV chimera containing the extracellular part of ONC-Xmrk fused to the intracellular domains of INV-Xmrk is strongly autophosphorylated when transiently expressed in human 293 cells. However, there are five mutations in the carboxyl terminus of ONC-Xmrk whose role was still unknown. Although the carboxyl terminus is the most divergent region in this family of receptors, two of the substitutions found there correspond to highly conserved residues in all subclass I RTKs. One is the exchange of a proline for leucine (P984L), and the other is a tyrosine for asparagine (Y1038N) (6Dimitrijevic N. Winkler C. Wellbrock C. Gómez A. Duschl J. Altschmied J. Schartl M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To exclude a possible contribution of the intracellular domain of ONC-Xmrk in its oncogenic activation, an INV-ONC chimera containing the extracellular sequences of INV-Xmrk and the intracellular region of ONC-Xmrk was generated. After transfection of 293 cells and immunoprecipitation of the chimeric receptor, the INV-ONC chimera showed a level of phosphorylation clearly lower than the ONC-INV construct and similar to that of INV-Xmrk (Fig.1). This indicates that all activating mutation(s) should be located in the extracellular part and none of the intracellular mutations of ONC-Xmrk is involved in activation. This was confirmed by introducing the five COOH-terminal amino acid changes (P984L, N1025T, A1035T, Y1038N, and L1156Q) into INV-Xmrk. All mutant receptors did not show enhanced autophosphorylation when compared with INV-Xmrk (data not shown). For technical reasons, the cDNAs from INV-Xmrk and ONC-Xmrk genes were originally isolated from two different species ofXiphophorus. The cDNA from INV-Xmrk was isolated from the Xiphophorus xiphidium-derived A2 cell line and ONC-Xmrk gene from the PSM cell line derived fromXiphophorus maculatus melanoma (18Wakamatsu Y. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 679-680PubMed Google Scholar). The different species origin of these two genes could account for some of the effective nucleotide differences between them. To distinguish which of the changes in the extracellular domains were due to a species-specific variation and which were potentially functional mutations of the oncogenic Xmrk, we sequenced a series of cosmid clones that contain genomic DNA from different alleles of X. maculatus INV- and ONC-Xmrk. The alignment on Fig.2 shows that none of the nucleotide polymorphisms results in an amino acid difference between X. maculatus and X. xiphidium INV-Xmrk. However, two of the amino acid changes noted earlier (P195H and S446R) probably are irrelevant as they do not appear in the ONC-Xmrk sequence obtained from X. maculatus DNA. They may be a cell line-specific characteristic as they appear exclusively in the PSM cells. They were not considered further; thus, the number of supposed effective mutations in the extracellular region of ONC-Xmrk is reduced to six. Four of these six mutations (G359R, P470L, S476N, and M595I) involve amino acids that are not conserved in other members of the EGFR family, the fifth includes the loss of a semiconserved proline (P388T), and the sixth eliminates a highly conserved cysteine (C578S) from the second cysteine-rich domain of the receptor. One mechanism described for RTKs resulting in constitutive activation is ligand-independent dimerization. Using a heterologous system (293 cells) for transient expression of the different Xmrk constructs, we had observed traces of a high molecular weight phosphorylated form of the molecule that, however, could not be resolved in the routine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This form appeared exclusively in the constructs where the extracellular domain of ONC-Xmrk was present (see Fig. 1). To test whether this could correspond to a dimeric form of the ONC-Xmrk receptor, electrophoreses in gradient denaturing gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions were performed. After blotting and detection of the proteins with an Xmrk antibody for both INV- and ONC-Xmrk, the appearance of a 160-kDa form that corresponds to the Xmrk monomer was recorded (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, for ONC-Xmrk under nonreducing conditions, another signal with a higher molecular weight was appearing that was consistent with the size of a dimer. This signal was not present under reducing conditions. When the ONC-INV and INV-ONC chimeras were subjected to the same analysis, the signal corresponding to the dimer was only present in the case of the ONC-INV chimera under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). These data point to the presence of one or several mutations in the extracellular part of ONC-Xmrk allowing ligand-independent covalent dimerization. To investigate whether disulfide-linked dimers were also present in ONC-Xmrk from fish melanoma cells, we analyzed PSM cells and melanoma tissue extracts on a gradient gel. The detection with an anti-mrk serum showed, in both cases, the presence of dimers under nonreducing conditions, whereas these were not present under reducing conditions (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that in vivo the same mechanism is present as studied after overexpression of ONC-Xmrk in 293 cells. To identify the extracellular mutation(s) present in ONC-Xmrk responsible for dimerization, additional chimeric constructs were made. In these constructs portions of the ONC-Xmrk extracellular domain were used to replace the corresponding regions in INV-Xmrk, thus introducing groups of mutations in the backbone of the proto-oncogene. Two new chimeras were constructed, Xmrk(G359R,P388T), which contains the two most amino-terminal mutations in the extracellular domain, and Xmrk(P470L,S476N,C578S,M595I), which contains the four last extracellular mutations of ONC-Xmrk. When these chimeras were subjected to Western blot analysis, dimer formation under nonreducing conditions was observed in both cases (Fig. 4), suggesting that more than one activating mutation exists in ONC-Xmrk that leads to ligand-independent receptor dimerization. It has been already described for RTKs (19Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar,20Neilson K.M. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25049-25057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that when one conserved cysteine involved in intramolecular disulfide bonding is lost the remaining cysteine of the pair is able to form an intermolecular disulphide bridge. This aberrant bonding leads to the formation of receptor dimers that can be observed under nonreducing conditions. In the case of ONC-Xmrk, a cysteine in position 578 is lost and substituted by a serine. To verify whether this change was one of the mutations involved in activation, an INV-Xmrk receptor containing the Cys-to-Ser mutation was constructed. After transient expression in 293 cells, the INV(C578S) mutant was immunoprecipitated with an anti-mrk serum and detected with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. This analysis showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant receptor compared with INV-Xmrk, demonstrating that the introduction of this mutation was sufficient to activate Xmrk receptor (Fig. 5 A). When the INV(C578S) receptor was analyzed on a denaturing gradient gel under nonreducing conditions, the appearance of a band was observed consistent with the size of the dimer as it appeared also for ONC-Xmrk (Fig.5 B). However, the extent of dimerization was lower than that observed for ONC-Xmrk, suggesting additional differences between the two receptors. To further limit the mutations being involved in dimer formation, a new construct was made wherein the Xmrk(P470L,S476N,C578S,M595I) chimera S578 was reverted to the wild type cysteine. The expression of the Xmrk(P470L,S476N,M595I) variant in 293 cells and subsequent analysis of the receptor protein showed that this receptor is not able to produce dimers (Fig. 5 C). This finding confirms that P470L, S476N, and M595I do not contribute to ONC-Xmrk activation. As shown by the Xmrk(G359R,P388T) chimera, there exists a second activating mutation in ONC-Xmrk that also leads to aberrant disulfide bridging and dimerization. To find out which of these two mutations was responsible for dimer formation, the Arg in position 359 was reverted to the wild type Gly. The analysis in gradient denaturing gels of 293 extracts expressing the Xmrk(P388T) mutant showed an almost complete disappearance of the dimer band, suggesting that the Arg in position 359 was the second activating mutation (Fig.6 A). To further support this, we introduced the Arg mutation in the backbone of INV-Xmrk and studied its level of phosphorylation. Cellular extracts from 293 cells transiently transfected with the INV(G359R) mutant were immunoprecipitated with an anti-mrk serum and subsequently detected with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody. The INV(G359R) mutant appeared strongly phosphorylated (Fig. 6 B), showing as in the case of the C578S mutation that covalent dimer formation correlates with increased receptor phosphorylation. Analysis of INV- and ONC-Xmrk with the same antibody on Western blots revealed that both receptors had slightly different electrophoretic mobilities in SDS denaturing gels. ONC-Xmrk always migrated as a smaller molecular weight form than INV-Xmrk (Fig.7 A). This different extent of migration was obviously associated with the activating mutations. The ONC-INV chimera showed the same mobility as ONC-Xmrk (data not shown). However, when the chimeras Xmrk(P470L,S476N,C578S,M595I) and Xmrk(G359R,P388T) containing only one of the activating mutations each were analyzed in Western blots, a mixture of the two forms characteristic of ONC- and INV-Xmrk appeared (Fig. 7 B). When both activating mutations were reverted to the proto-oncogenic residues, the resulting Xmrk(P388T) and Xmrk(P470L, S476N,M595I) proteins migrated in the SDS denaturing gels like the proto-oncogenic form of the receptor. As all these proteins contain the same number of amino acids, this could reflect a different post-translational modification. The main post-translational modification in the extracellular domain of a receptor tyrosine kinase from the family of the EGFR is the glycosylation of certain asparagine residues. However, none of the mutations affects a canonical glycosylation sequence. It has been reported that proteins that expose reactive thiol groups can be retained in the ER (21Isidoro C. Maggioni C. Demoz M. Pizzagalli A. Fra A.M. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 42: 26138-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because of incorrect folding, they are kept there by some kind of quality control mechanism and they are not processed further to the Golgi (22Roussel M.F. Downing J.R. Rettenmier C.W. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 979-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Gethring M.-J. McCammon K. Sambrook J. Cell. 1986; 46: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins stopped in this cellular compartment contain high mannose type oligosaccharides and are therefore sensitive to endoglycosidase H (endo H) digestion. In contrast, fully N-glycosylated receptors anchored in the membrane are endo H-resistant. In the case of ONC-Xmrk, we have demonstrated that the activating mutations lead to the formation of receptor dimers by intermolecular disulfide bridging between unpaired cysteines. To test whether these proteins containing activating mutations and thereby leaving active thiol groups were endo H-sensitive, we performed digestions on extracts corresponding to transient transfections of INV- and ONC-Xmrk in 293 cells. The ONC-Xmrk form of approximately 155 kDa was completely digested, and a band of about 135 kDa appeared (Fig. 7 A), which is consistent with the size of the unglycosylated form of ONC-Xmrk as already described (9Malitschek B. Wittbrodt J. Fischer P. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schartl M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10423-10430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the INV-Xmrk form of 160 kDa is barely affected by the action of endo H (Fig. 7 A). Endo H digestion of the Xmrk(G359R,P388T) and Xmrk(P470L,S476N,C578S,M595I) chimeras also showed the existence of the ONC-Xmrk endo H-sensitive form that was not present when the mutations were reverted to the wild type amino acids as shown in the Xmrk(P388T) and Xmrk(P470L,S476N,M595I) chimeras (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that ONC-Xmrk containing both mutations is retained in the ER and is not properly transported and located in the outer cellular membrane. To elucidate the cellular localization of the different Xmrk receptors, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of stable Ba/F3 clones expressing the ONC or INV-ONC receptors. The BaF INV-ONC cells showed stronger membrane and weaker cytoplasmic anti-mrk staining, indicating a correct transport of the receptor to the plasma membrane (Fig.8). However, in BaF ONC cells, the anti-mrk signals were preferentially detected directly around the nuclear membrane, suggesting a localization in the ER and confirming that the processing of the Xmrk receptor is affected when the extracellular mutations are present. ONC-Xmrk activation results from at least two mechanisms: overexpression and mutational alteration. In the present study, we have identified the activating mutations and characterized thei"
https://openalex.org/W2029870402,"Prothymosin α (ProTα), a cellular molecule known to be associated with cell proliferation, is transcriptionally up-regulated on expression of c-myc and interacts with histones in vitro and associates with histone H1 in cells. Previous studies have also shown that ProTα is involved in chromatin remodeling. Recent studies have shown that ProTα interacts with the acetyl transferase p300 and an essential Epstein-Barr virus protein, EBNA3C, involved in regulation of viral and cellular transcription. These studies suggest a potential involvement in regulation of histone acetylation through the association with these cellular and viral factors. In the current studies, we show that heterologous expression of ProTα in the Rat-1 rodent fibroblast cell line results in increased proliferation, loss of contact inhibition, anchorage-independent growth, and decreased serum dependence. These phenotypic changes seen in transfected Rat-1 cells are similar to those observed with a known oncoprotein, Ras, expressed under the control of a heterologous promoter and are characteristic oncogenic growth properties. These results demonstrate that the ProTα gene may function as an oncogene when stably expressed in Rat-1 cells and may be an important downstream cellular target for inducers of cellular transformation, which may include Epstein-Barr virus and c-myc."

Understanding the structural properties of the intermediates that occur in the folding/unfolding pathway(s) would explain how the vast conformational space available could be narrowed down early during folding to yield the native state of the protein (20Hogan S.J.

Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Roder H. Elove S.W. Englander S.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). It is found that helix formation in proteins occurs within the low millisecond scale of refolding (24Roder H. Elove S.W. Englander S.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). This aspect is not surprising because formation of a helix involves intrastrand, local hydrogen bonding interactions. By contrast, very little information exists on the modes of refolding of all β-sheet proteins. As the β-sheet formation involves interstrand interactions between distant parts of the polypeptide chain, proteins belonging to this structural class (all β-sheet proteins) are predicted to refold slowly (25Shakhnovich E. Abkevich V. Ptitsyn O.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, investigation of folding kinetics of several α + β proteins using quenched-flow hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange revealed that stable β-sheet, and α-helix formation occurs on a similar time scale (18Briggs M.S. Roder H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Lu J. Dahlquist F.W.

Interestingly, folding studies on interleukin-1β, an all β-sheet protein, showed that stable β-sheet formation only occurs on a time scale greater than 50 s (25Shakhnovich E. Abkevich V. Ptitsyn O.B.

In the present study, we investigate the events in the refolding kinetics of hFGF-1 using a variety of biophysical techniques such as stopped-flow fluorescence, stopped-flow CD, and quenched-flow hydrogen exchange. The results obtained in this study reveal that refolding of the protein occurs very slowly via the formation of transient intermediate(s). In addition, the β-strands constituting the heparin binding domain appear to form significantly faster than the other β-strands constituting the β-barrel structure of hFGF-1. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid-NH4+ salt was purchased from Sigma. Ultrapure urea was procured from Merck, and heparin-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Labeled 15NH4Cl and urea-d 4 were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. All other chemicals used were of high quality analytical grade. Unless and otherwise mentioned, all solutions were made in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mmammonium sulfate. All experiments were performed at 20 °C. Expression vector for the truncated form of the human FGF-1 (hFGF-1, residues 15–154) was constructed and inserted between the Nde I andBam HI restriction sites in pET20b. The plasmid containing the hFGF-1 insert was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The expressed protein was purified on heparin-Sepharose column using a NaCl gradient (0–1.5 m). The protein was desalted by ultrafiltration using an Amicon set up. The homogeneity of the protein was assessed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The authenticity of the sample was further verified by electron spray-mass analysis. The concentration of the protein was estimated from the extinction coefficient value at 280 nm. Uniform15N isotope labeling was achieved using M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl. To realize maximal expression yields, the composition of the M9 medium was modified by the addition of a mixture mixture of vitamins. The expression host strainE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS is a vitamin B1-deficient host, and hence the medium was supplemented with thiamine (vitamin B1). Protein expression yields were in the range of 25–30 mg/liter of the isotope-enriched medium. The extent of 15N labeling was verified by electron spray-mass analysis. All fluorescence experiments were carried out on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter using a 1-cm quartz cell. The final concentration of the protein used was 100 μg/ml. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. The tryptophan emission was monitored between 300 and 450 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were set at 2.5 and 10 nm, respectively. The fraction of unfolded species formed at various concentrations of urea were estimated based on the 308 to 350 nm ratio. All far-UV CD experiments were performed on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a quartz cell of 1-cm path length. Each spectra was an average of 5 scans. The concentration of the protein used was 0.5 mg/ml. Necessary background corrections were made in all spectra. The kinetics of unfolding and refolding were monitored by fluorescence using an SF-61 stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Hi-Tech Scientific Co., UK). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements were made by exciting the protein at 280 nm (2.5 nm band pass) via a 0.2-cm path length cell and monitoring the emission intensity at 350 nm (at 20 °C). For 1:10 mixing ratios in both unfolding or refolding experiments gave a final protein concentration of 1 μm hFGF-1 in 100 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.0), at 20 °C (containing 100 mmammonium sulfate), in different urea concentrations. From 0.2–5 μm protein, no deviations longer than 5% were detected in the rates or relative amplitudes. The data were fit to a two exponential equation and analyzed using the RKBIN software provided by Hi-tech Scientific Co., UK. For the stopped-flow ANS binding experiments, the stock solution of ANS (300 μm) was appropriately mixed (in the concentration range between 50 and 250 μm) into the native buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0)). 10 μm of equilibrium-unfolded hFGF-1 (in 4 m urea) was diluted 10-fold into 270 μl of the native buffer containing ANS. This procedure ensured that the concentration of the protein (1 μm) and urea (0.4m) remained unchanged during the refolding reaction in the presence of different concentrations of ANS. The binding of ANS was monitored by setting the excitation and emission wavelengths at 418 and 517 nm, respectively. The bandwidth used in all the measurements was 2 nm. The protein concentration-dependent ANS binding experiments were carried out under similar conditions by varying the protein concentration (in the range of 0.5 to 5 μm). Stopped-flow CD experiments were performed using SFM-3 Biologic stopped-flow apparatus attached to a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. The cell path length was 1 mm, and the dead time of the instrument was estimated to be about 5 ms. Refolding was initiated by a 10-fold dilution of the denatured hFGF-1 (in 4 m urea) sample with the refolding buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0), 20 °C). The data presented are an average of 30 scans. The reaction between sodium salt of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol and l-ascorbic acid (using a mixing ratio of 1:1) was used to determine the performance limits of the instrument. The disappearance of the color of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol was followed at 524 nm. All solutions contained 0.2 m NaCl to minimize the ionic strength effects. The ellipticity changes at 228 nm were analyzed employing an in-built Biologic software. All experiments were carried out at 20 ± 0.1 °C using a RQF-63 rapid mixing quenched-flow apparatus (Hi-Tech Scientific Co., UK). Complete denaturation and exchange of the backbone amide protons with deuterium was achieved by dissolving 4 m urea into a uniformly 15N labeled hFGF-1 solution, previously equilibrated for 24 h in D2O at pD 6.6 ± 0.2. Refolding of the denatured protein was initiated by a 10-fold dilution with 100 mmphosphate buffer (pH 5.0, containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate) prepared in H2O. At this pH, negligible labeling occurred. After variable refolding times ranging from 8 ms to 100 s, the solution was diluted again to 10 times the initial protein volume with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 9.0) (containing 100 nm ammonium sulfate), to initiate labeling of the deuterated amides in hFGF-1 with protons. After a lapse of 10 ms, the labeling phase was stopped by a further 3.4 times dilution of the initial protein volume with 1 m phosphoric acid in water. It should be mentioned that there were no signs of aggregation during any of the refolding steps in the quenched-flow experiments. 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of each sample was recorded on a Bruker DMX 600-MHz NMR spectrometer at 20 °C. A 5-mm inverse probe with a self-shielded z-gradient was used to obtain all gradient-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra. 15N decoupling during acquisition were accomplished using the GARP sequence. 2048 complex data points were collected in the 1H dimension of the1H-15N HSQC experiments. In the 15N dimension of the spectra, 512 complex data points were obtained.15N chemical shifts were referenced using the consensus ratio of 0.0101329118. All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Work station using the UX NMR and Aurelia softwares. The intensities of the cross-peaks in the HSQC spectra collected at various refolding times were normalized based on the peak height of the Ile-70 γ-methyl protons (−0.2 ppm) in the one-dimensional1H NMR spectra collected each time prior to recording the HSQC spectra. The time courses of change in proton occupancies were fitted to a single exponential decay (y = A exp−kt + C, where A is the amplitude of the phase, k is the apparent rate constant, andC is the final amplitude) by the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares method, yielding rate constants and phase amplitudes in the kinetic refolding experiment. All data analysis was performed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy software). The fluorescence spectrum of hFGF-1 shows an emission maxima at around 308 nm (Fig.2, inset A). The fluorescence of the lone tryptophan residue located at position 121 of the sequence is completely quenched in the native state of the protein (33Lozano R.M. Pineda-Lucena A. Gonzalez C. Jimenez M.A. Cuevas P. Redono-Horcajo M. Sanz J.M. Rico M. Gimemez G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4982-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Burke C.J. Volkin D.B. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6419-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The quenching effect is attributed to the presence of proximal imidazole and pyrrole groups in the three-dimensional structure of hFGF-1. However, unfolding of the protein relieves the quenching effect, and the fluorescence spectrum of the protein in the unfolded state shows an emission maxima at around 350 nm (Fig. 2, inset A). Hence, the refolding/unfolding kinetics of hFGF-1 was monitored by the changes in the emission intensity at 350 nm. Fig. 2 shows the urea-induced unfolding curve of hFGF-1 monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. The protein is completely unfolded at concentrations of urea greater than 3.2 m. The urea-induced structural transitions are completely reversible. The concentration of denaturant (C m) at which the protein (hFGF-1) is half unfolded (ΔG u = 0) is estimated to be 2.3m. The m value, which is a measure of the cooperativity of the unfolding transition, is found to be 1.53 ± 0.4 kcal·mol−1·m−1. The free energy of unfolding in the absence of the denaturant (ΔG u(H2O)) obtained by extrapolation of ΔG u to zero denaturant concentration is calculated to be 3.46 ± 0.2 kcal·mol−1. To test if the unfolding transition monitored by fluorescence reflected a total disruption of the overall structure of the protein, or just a local unfolding, we analyzed the chemical denaturation of hFGF-1 induced by urea using far-UV CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectrum of hFGF-1 shows a prominent positive ellipticity band centered at 228 nm. This CD band (at 228 nm) is a composite signal and is representative of the secondary and tertiary structural interactions in the protein (Fig. 2,inset B). Upon complete unfolding of the protein (at urea concentrations greater than 3.2 m), the 228 nm far-UV CD band shows negative ellipticity values (Fig. 2, inset B). The urea-induced equilibrium unfolding curves followed by fluorescence and CD are nearly superimposable. Within experimental error(s), the ΔG u(H2O) (3.40 ± 0.4 kcal·mole1) estimated from the urea-induced far-UV ellipticity is identical to that calculated based on fluorescence spectroscopy. These results strongly suggest that the urea-induced equilibrium denaturation of hFGF-1 follows a two-state (native ↔ unfolded state) mechanism, without the accumulation of stable intermediate(s). Fig. 3shows the stopped-flow time traces of the refolding of urea-denatured hFGF-1 (at 25 °C) monitored by the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence (at 350 nm). Complete signal evolution (at 350 nm) occurs within a refolding time of 50 s. The fluorescence trace could not be satisfactorily fit to a single exponential function. A sum of two exponentials best fits the refolding curve yielding refolding rate constant values of 0.131 ± 0.02 and 0.023 ± 07 s−1 for the faster and slower phases, respectively (Table I). The first phase associated with the faster rate accounts for 80–85% of the total refolding amplitude. The slower phase has an amplitude of about 10–20%. This phase of refolding is probably associated with thecis-trans-proline isomerization (discussed below). No burst phase is observed to occur as is evident from the close agreement between the fluorescence signals at time 0 and that extrapolated from the equilibrium unfolded hFGF-1 base line. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of occurrence of the burst phase intermediate(s) because the burst phase changes cannot be traced under conditions where the intermediate(s) has similar fluorescence as the unfolded state.Table IRate and time constant of the various phases of refolding of hFGF-1First phaseSecond phaseRate constantRefolding time constantRate constantRefolding time constants−1sFluorescence0.131 ± 0.027.63 ± 1.00.023 ± 0.0743.47 ± 14.32CD1.24 ± 0.650.806 ± 0.27NO1-aNO, not observed.NOANS0.21 ± 0.0122.76 ± 0.210.018 ± 0.00853.3 ± 171-a NO, not observed. Open table in a new tab hFGF-1 like many other β-barrel proteins shows a far-UV positive ellipticity band at 228 nm, signifying the secondary and, to a lesser extent, the tertiary structural interactions in the protein. The far-UV ellipticity changes (at 228 nm) are complete within a time span of 3 s (Fig. 4). The ellipticity changes could be best fit to a single exponential equation yielding a refolding time constant of 1.24 ± 0.65 s−1. The slow minor phase (observed in the stopped-flow fluorescence experiment) possibly representing thecis-trans-proline isomerization is not observed in the stopped-flow CD experiments. In addition, no burst phase ellipticity change(s) could be detected during the refolding of hFGF-1. Within experimental error, the ellipticity (at 228 nm) at time 0 is similar to that obtained from the equilibrium unfolded state base line. It is interesting to note that the refolding rate constant value of the major phase estimated using the stopped-flow fluorescence (0.131 ± 0.02 s−1) and stopped-flow CD do not match (TableI). The fast recovery of the 228 nm ellipticity signal presumably reflects the rapid acquisition of some portion(s) of the native structure prior to the burial of the tryptophan in the interior of the protein. Thus, the results of the stopped-flow fluorescence and stopped-flow CD experiments strongly suggest the accumulation of transient intermediate(s) in the kinetic refolding pathway of hFGF-1. It has been observed that in many proteins where an intermediate in equilibrium conditions is not found, the analysis of the refolding kinetics shows the unambiguous presence of an intermediate. The kinetics of refolding were examined at 20 °C over a range of urea concentrations (up to 6m) by monitoring the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence using the stopped-flow fluorescence technique. Fig.5 shows the urea dependence of the natural logarithm of the observed rate constant of folding/unfolding. Interestingly, the slow phase (minor phase) shows no denaturant dependence and is consistent with it being a rate-limiting proline isomerization event. The unfolding rate decreases linearly with the increase in urea concentration (Fig. 5). However, a prominent curvature could be observed at low concentrations of the denaturant (Fig. 5). In general, a deviation from linearity (“roll over”) is believed to reflect the accumulation of intermediate species at low denaturant concentrations (36Jackson S.E. Folding Design. 1998; 3: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). For a protein folding typically by a two-state mechanism, the Chevron plot (ln k versus concentration of the denaturant) is expected to be V-shaped, with no roll over. In summary, these results clearly suggest that the refolding of hFGF-1 occurs via the formation of transient intermediate(s). There is a lot of controversy on the interpretation of the roll over in the Chevron plot (35Matouschek A. Matthews J.M. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R.

Biol. 1999; 293: 1195-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Curvatures in Chevron plots, in addition to accumulation of kinetic intermediates, could also be ascribed to the movements of the transition state ensemble (36Jackson S.E. Folding Design. 1998; 3: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 39Otzen D.E. Kritensen O. Proctor M. Oliveberg M.

Biol. 1998; 277: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). According to the broad barrier model of protein folding, the folding process is proposed to occur isoenergetically at the transition state level, and hence the position of the transition state ensemble is expected to be sensitive to denaturant conditions (36Jackson S.E. Folding Design. 1998; 3: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the human spliceosomal protein have demonstrated that the roll over in the Chevron plot could also be due to the movements of the transition state along the top of a very broad and flat activation barrier (Hammond effect, see Refs. 41Oliveberg M. Tan Y.J. Silow M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 42Cota E. Clarke J.

Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In general, Hammond effects (during protein folding/unfolding) are manifested as curvatures in both the limbs of the Chevron plot (35Matouschek A. Matthews J.M. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this context, as the roll over is observed in only one of the limbs of the Chevron plot of hFGF-1, it could be possibly attributed to the accumulation transient intermediate(s) rather than to the movement of the transition state ensemble. ANS is a popular hydrophobic dye used to probe early events in protein folding (45Jones B.E. Jennings P.A. Pierre R.A. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15250-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Shastry M.C.R. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 47Engelhard M. Evans P.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ANS is known to bind to transiently exposed hydrophobic patches during folding of many proteins, leading to a prominent increase in the fluorescence intensity of the dye. Refolding of hFGF-1 was monitored in the presence of ANS at 520 nm. No prominent intensity changes were observed within the dead time of the instrument. Thus, it appears that the refolding hFGf-1 does not involve early burst phase events such as the hydrophobic collapse. Interestingly, after 1 s of initiation of refolding, the ANS fluorescence intensity shows a dramatic increase and reaches a maximum value at around 2.2 s (Fig.6). Beyond this refolding time (>2.2 s), the emission intensity exponentially decreases to reach a steady state value that is much higher"

Recombination, replication, methylation, repair, and transcription are processes that proceed through intermediates in which DNA is distorted. The process of RNA transcript formation by all RNA polymerases must involve a DNA-melting event to reveal the template DNA strand (1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B.

Distortion of the DNA leading to the nucleation of strand separation occurs within the closed complex formed between RNA polymerases and the promoter. Following isomerization of the polymerase, full stable DNA opening is evident, which is thought to have spread from the initial nucleation site. Single-stranded DNA-binding activities in the RNA polymerase are required for DNA opening, and in the case of the bacterial RNA polymerase, the ς subunit plays an important role (1Gross C.A. Chan C.

For the ς70-type factor, binding to the core enzyme induces conformational changes in a single-stranded DNA-binding region of the protein. As a consequence of these conformational changes, ς70 gains specificity for the non-template strand of the melted region in the open complex (8Callaci S. Heyduk T.

For the ς54-type factor, unrelated by sequence to ς70, the determinants of single-stranded DNA binding are less well described. Single-stranded DNA binding by ς54is evident, however (4Guo Y. Wang L.

Isomerization is associated with an increased DNase I footprint of ς54 on DNA, extending toward the transcription start site (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we use DNA footprinting to show that the DNA within the isomerized ς54-DNA complex has melted and that some melting is negatively regulated by Region I of ς54. However, extensive melting requires Region I. Additionally, changed interactions between ς54 and the nucleated DNA are evident in complexes in which melting has occurred. We show that the presence of core RNA polymerase inhibits those changes in ς54-DNA interactions that occur in response to activator, consistent with the view that tight binding to the early melted DNA limits DNA opening (4Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results provide clear evidence in favor of an activation mechanism in which conformational changes in a basal ς54-DNA complex are brought about by the enhancer-binding activator. Activator-independent melting suggests that the activator does not function exclusively as a site-specific DNA helicase for DNA opening (11Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Wang J.T. Syed A. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The promoter fragments used in this work were Escherichia coli glnHp2 from −60 to +28 in which T at −13 was replaced by G and the −11/−10 sequence was replaced with a CA/TG mismatch to create a short unpaired DNA element next to a consensus GC (−13/−12) promoter element or a mismatched sequence between −11 and −6 (see Fig. 1). Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter fragments from −60 to +28 either containing a CA/TG mismatch immediately adjacent to the consensus GC element or with the A-12 top strand base missing (gapped duplex) were also used (see Fig.1) (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Synthetic DNA strands from −60 to +28 were annealed to create the duplex, with either strand 5′-32P-end-labeled. The unlabeled strand was at 2-fold molar excess. The Klebsiella pneumoniae ς54 protein, its Region I-deleted derivative lacking the first 56 amino acids (ΔIς54), and Region I (amino acids 1–56) were prepared as described previously (11Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Casaz P. Buck M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Gallegos M.-T. Cannon W. Buck M. J. Biol.

The activator was E. coliPspF lacking a functional C-terminal DNA-binding domain (PspFΔHTH) (26Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). E. coli core RNA polymerase was from Epicentre Technologies Corp. End-labeled DNA (16–100 nm) and 1 μm ς54 or ΔIς54 in a 10-μl reaction in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Activator PspFΔHTH (0.5–4 μm) and dGTP, GTP, or GTPγS1 (4 mm) were added for a further 10 min. Region I was at 0.5 μm. Where indicated, heparin (100 μg/ml) was added for 5 min prior to gel loading. Free DNA was separated from ς-bound DNA on 4.5% native polyacrylamide gels run in 25 mm Tris and 200 mm glycine at room temperature. Binding reactions were conducted as described above; footprinting reagents were added; reactions were terminated; and bound and unbound DNAs were separated on native gels as described above. DNA was then excised, processed, and analyzed on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. For DNase I footprints, 1.75 × 10−3 units of enzyme (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a 10-μl binding reaction for 1 min, followed by addition of 10 mm EDTA to stop cutting. For KMnO4 footprinting, 4 mm fresh KMnO4 was added for 30 s, followed by 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol to quench DNA oxidation. Gel-isolated DNA was eluted into 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) (DNase I footprints) or H2O (KMnO4 footprints) overnight at 37 °C. KMnO4-oxidized DNA was cleaved with 10% (v/v) piperidine at 90 °C for 20 min. Recoveries of isolated DNA were determined by dry Cerenkov counting, and equal numbers of counts were loaded onto gels. Previously, we showed that purified ς54 bound to the S. meliloti nifH promoter was able to isomerize if the DNA template had an unpaired sequence downstream of the GC element of the promoter (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The isomerization also required activator and nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis and was characterized as an extended ς54-DNA interaction toward the transcription start site. The unpaired DNA downstream of the GC promoter element was suggested to mimic the nucleation of DNA melting (early melted DNA) seen in ς54 closed complexes, which normally requires ς54 and core RNA polymerase (23Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martı́n F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have used variants of the ς54-dependent E. coli glnHp2 promoter (27Claverie-Martı́n F. Magasanik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 996-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) to explore DNA melting by ς54. We chose to generate a nucleated glnHp2 promoter because the high AT content of the sequence should facilitate the detection of unstacked T residues using KMnO4 as a DNA footprinting reagent (28Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Base unstacking occurs when DNA melts, and the associated increased reactivity to KMnO4 is readily detected. Initially, we used a gel shift assay to show that ς54 bound to the modified glnHp2 promoter with unpaired DNA at −11/−10 and, in a reaction requiring hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate (dGTP) and activator, produced a supershifted heparin-resistant complex (ssς-DNA, Fig.2 A, lane 4). As seen before, the same mobility-supershifted complex formed with activators of different molecular weights, providing evidence that the activator was not stably associated with the isomerized complex (Ref.24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and data not shown). Formation of this complex required ς54 Region I (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 4 and 8). Addition of Region I in trans to ΔIς54 resulted in a new species with similar mobility to that of the supershifted complex, independent of activator and nucleotide (Fig. 2 A, lanes 9 and 10). Using DNase I footprinting, we showed that the DNA within the isomerized ς54 complex was protected more than in the complex formed with ς54 in the absence of activator and nucleotide (Fig. 2 B). The downstream edge of the ς54 footprint extended to about −5 (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). In the isomerized complex, the footprint extended clearly to +2, but a partial footprint to +5 was also detected (Fig.2 B, lane 4). The upstream edge of the footprint was not easily discernible due to background DNA fragments in the undigested sample (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 5). Binding of ΔIς54 did not lead to the extended DNase I footprint of ς54 seen with the activator-dependent isomerized complex, but weakly footprinted to about −7 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 9 and 10). Addition of Region I in trans to ΔIς54 resulted in a DNase I footprint indistinguishable from that of the non-isomerized ς54-DNA complex (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 7 and 8 with the lane 3). The overall results showed that ς54-DNA interactions at glnHp2 are changed by the action of activator in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Non-hydrolyzable nucleotide GTPγS did not substitute for dGTP to produce an extended footprint (data not shown). Qualitatively, the results are similar to those obtained with the S. meliloti nifH promoter (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and clearly indicate that activator-dependent ς54isomerization may be readily demonstrated with a number of different promoters. We used KMnO4 to probe for DNA melting within isomerized complexes. KMnO4 footprints at 30 °C using the S. meliloti nifH early melted DNA (−12/−11) in the isomerized complex did not convincingly show extra DNA melting, but the unpaired T residue at −12 of the heteroduplex region was much less reactive in both ς54-DNA complexes (data not shown). These KMnO4 footprints were repeated at 37 °C and with a promoter derivative having a single base pair of heteroduplex at −12 (top strand A replaced with C) (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Results with the −12/−11 heteroduplex showed no extra DNA melting at the elevated temperature, but the unpaired T residue at −12 in the isomerized complex was more reactive to KMnO4 (data not shown). However, footprints using the C-12 heteroduplex DNA in the isomerized complex showed that, at 37 °C, the template strand T at −9 had a 2-fold increase in KMnO4 reactivity, indicating some extra DNA melting (data not shown). This contrasts with results obtained with glnHp2 derivatives (see below and Fig.3), where considerable extra DNA melting in the isomerized complex was seen at 30 °C. It seems that melting of the nifH promoter within the isomerized complex occurs less frequently than with glnHp2 and may relate to differences in the ease with which the DNA strands of the two promoters can separate (see “Discussion”). Footprints of the glnHp2 −11/−10 promoter DNA show convincingly that the isomerized complex has extra DNA melting. As shown in Fig. 3 A, ς54 strongly protected the template strand unpaired T residue at −11 from KMnO4attack (compare lanes 2 and 3). In the isomerized complex, this protection was lost, and KMnO4 reactivity was evident at the unpaired T residue at −11 as well as at the new positions −9 and −7 (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 3and 4). The bases at −11, −9, and −7 must be within an altered DNA structure compared with the free DNA and the non-isomerized ς54-DNA complex. It seems that activator brings about some extra DNA melting as well as changing the interaction of ς54 with the T residue at −11. The KMnO4reactivity of the bands was quantified to enhance the reliability of the interpretation (Table I). The same patterns of enhanced reactivity and protection were seen in three independent experiments. Controls in which either activator or hydrolyzable NTP was omitted or a non-hydrolyzable NTP (GTPγS) was used showed that the extra DNA melting at −9 and −7 and the changed footprint at −11 required activator plus hydrolyzable nucleotide (data not shown). In the absence of these components, the ς54-DNA footprint remained unchanged, and the only complex evident in the gel shift assay was the fast running ς54-DNA complex (data not shown).Table IQuantification of KMnO 4 signals from Fig. 3T positionStrandDNAς54-DNAssς54-DNAΔIς54+ RIΔIς54−11Template10.140.440.270.36(0.01)(0.08)(0.08)(0.02)−9Template10.922.541.381.56(0.03)(0.37)(0.47)(0.14)−8Non-template10.802.090.990.98(0.08)(0.24)(0.02)(0.10)−7Template11.022.581.151.11(0.03)(0.17)(0.50)(0.20)−6Non-template10.691.900.960.92(0.06)(0.10)(0.06)(0.21)KMnO4 reactivities of T residues at positions −11, −9, and −7 (template strand) residues and −8 and −6 (non-template strand) in ς-DNA complexes are expressed by their ratio to signals without protein (reactivity = 1; Fig. 3, A and B,lanes 2).

S.D. values are in parentheses. ssς54-DNA, supershifted ς54-DNA complex; RI, Region I. KMnO4 was used to probe the non-template strand in ς54-DNA and isomerized ς54-DNA complexes forming with the modified glnHp2 promoter. As shown in Fig.3 B (see also Table I), T residues at −8 and −6 were KMnO4-reactive in isomerized complexes that formed in response to activator and hydrolyzable nucleotide (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). In the absence of activator and hydrolyzable nucleotide, the same sequences were no more reactive to KMnO4 than the naked DNA (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 2 and 3; see also Table I). As seen for the template strand (Fig. 3 A), isomerization of the ς54-DNA complex was accompanied by some local DNA melting. In both cases, melting seems to extend from the −11/−10 heteroduplex region by at least (interpretation is limited by the placement of a potentially reactive T residue) an extra 4 base pairs toward the transcription start site (summarized in Fig. 7). Melting at these locations is seen in natural open promoter complexes forming with the ς54 holoenzyme (13Morett E. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Popham D.L. Szeto D. Keener J. Kustu S. Science. 1989; 243: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 15Sasse-Dwight S.

The lack of reactivity of non-template T at −4 suggests either that the transcription start site sequence is not stably opened in the isomerized complex or that T at −4 is protected by ς54 from KMnO4attack. The amino-terminal 50 amino acids of ς54 (Region I) function to inhibit isomerization of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme as well as to promote enhancer responsiveness (30Casaz P. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Syed A. Gralla J.D.

Activities of Region I include contributions to the DNA-binding function of ς54, particularly the recognition and creation of the nucleated DNA near −12, and an interaction with core RNA polymerase (4Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Chaney M. Buck M. Mol.

Removal of Region I results in activator-independent transcription if the DNA is transiently opened and allows the holoenzyme to engage with pre-melted DNA (11Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Casaz P.

Using KMnO4 to probe the template strand of the glnHp2-ΔIς54 complex, we found some evidence for weak activator-independent melting. As shown in Fig. 3 A(lane 8), the T residue at −9 showed some increased KMnO4 reactivity in the ΔIς54 complex compared with the zero protein control (lane 2). This region of extra DNA melting appears to be a subset of that found within the activator-dependent complex forming with full-length ς54 (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 4 and 8). The restricted pattern of melting at −9 seen with ΔIς54 was independent of nucleotide and activator (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 7 and 8). Quantitative treatment of the KMnO4 reactivity (Table I) showed a constant increase in the reactivity of T at −9 when ΔIς54 was bound. The increase was seen in three independent experiments. The T reside at −11 in the ΔIς54 complex was slightly more protected compared with the isomerized ς54 complex (Fig. 3 A), but significantly more reactive than ς54 alone to KMnO4 attack (compare lanes 3, 4, and 8; also see Table I). It seems that removal of Region I partially deregulates ς54 melting activity. Region I supplied in trans did not result in a significant change in KMnO4 reactivity to suggest a shift in the footprint toward that of the non-isomerized ς54-DNA complex (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 3 and 5; and TableI). It seems that, although Region I binds to the −12/−11-ΔIς54 complex, this does not lead to large changes in KMnO4 reactivity (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). KMnO4 was used to probe the non-template strand in the ΔIς54-DNA complexes forming with the modified glnHp2 promoter. As shown in Fig. 3 B (lanes 5–8) and Table I, no sequences were significantly more KMnO4-reactive than in the unbound DNA (Fig. 3 B,lane 2). For the ΔIς54-DNA complex, no further changes in KMnO4 reactivity were detected in response to activator and hydrolyzable nucleotide (Fig. 3 B,lane 7). Region I supplied in trans to ΔIς54-DNA binding assays did not change non-template strand KMnO4 reactivity (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6). The extra DNA opening from −9 to −6 seen in the activator-dependent isomerized complex (Fig. 3) could arise from activator functioning as a DNA helicase. To explore this issue, we wished to learn if pre-opening the DNA from −11 to −6 would allow the ς54 to bind promoter DNA in an isomerized state without activator. The interaction of ς54 with glnHp2 promoter DNA mismatched from −11 to −6 (see Fig. 1) to mimic the DNA opening seen in the activator-dependent isomerized complexes was examined in the presence and absence of activator. Gel shift assays showed that ς54 bound the −11/−6 opened DNA to give an initial complex (ssς*-DNA) with reduced mobility compared with the −11/−10 opened DNA complex (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 5). The reduced mobility was similar to that of the activator-dependent isomerized complex (ssς-DNA) forming on the −11/−10 opened DNA (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 5). The mobility of the ς54 complex with DNA opened from −11 to −6 was unchanged by activator and hydrolyzable nucleotide (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 5). To more fully understand the properties of these slow running complexes, we probed them by DNase I and KMnO4 footprinting. Using glnHp2 promoter DNA mismatched from −11 to −6, ς54 gave a short DNase I footprint to −5 and no extra KMnO4 reactivity, and footprints were insensitive to activator and nucleotide (data not shown). We conclude that the reduced mobility of the ς54complex with DNA opened from −11 to −6 is due to the altered DNA conformation and that pre-opening the DNA does not drive the change in ς54 needed for the extended downstream DNase I footprint to at least +2 seen in activator-dependent isomerized complexes (Fig. 2 B, lane 4) (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Instead, a change in ς54 conformation driven by the activator seems to be necessary for the extended footprint to +2. The insensitivity of the ς54 complex on the −11/−6 opened DNA to activator suggests that the DNA from −9 to −6 should be in a double-stranded form for activator to act on ς54, consistent with prior work with the S. meliloti nifH promoter (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We previously observed with the S. meliloti nifH promoter that removal of the top strand A-12 residue resulted in a ς54-DNA complex that did not form a new slow running species when incubated with activator and hydrolyzable or non-hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 2, 4, and 5 with lane 6) (24Cannon W. Gallegos M.-T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ΔIς54 formed a slower running complex when Region I was in trans (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 2,6, and 7). To characterize these complexes and to determine their relationship to the isomerized complex, we used DNase I and KMnO4 footprinting. The S. meliloti nifHpromoter −12 gap (top strand) probe (see Fig. 1) gave a DNase I footprint with a distinct region that was cut poorly compared with the intact probe (data not shown). This region centered over the −12 gap and extended ∼4 bases on either side, suggesting a locally altered DNA structure refractory to DNase I cutting. When ς54bound, extra cutting from −10 to −1 was also evident, suggesting that ς54 stabilized a double-stranded DNA structure otherwise absent from the unbound gapped DNA (data not shown)."

A chromatographic purification of <i>E. histolytica</i> nuclear extracts by gel filtration, cation exchange, and sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography led to a 700-fold increase in URE4 binding activity and the appearance of two dominant protein species with molecular masses of 28 and 18 kDa. These proteins, termed <i>E. histolytica</i> enhancer-binding proteins 1 and 2 (EhEBP1 and EhEBP2), were sequenced by tandem mass spectroscopy and their corresponding cDNA clones identified. Recombinant EhEBP1 and EhEBP2 were able to bind double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the URE4 motif in a sequence-specific manner, and antibodies raised against EhEBP1 were able to interfere with the formation of URE4-protein complexes in crude nuclear extracts. Overexpression of EhEBP1 in <i>E. histolytica</i> trophozoites resulted in a 7-fold drop in promoter activity in transiently transfected reporter gene constructs when the URE4 motif was present, confirming its ability to specifically recognize the URE4 motif and suggesting that additional cofactors may be required for transcriptional activation by URE4. Further characterization and identification of binding partners for EhEBP1 and EhEBP2, the first proteins with demonstrated sequence-specific DNA binding activity to be identified in <i>E. histolytica</i>, should provide new insights into transcriptional regulation in this protozoan parasite."

However, the mechanisms responsible for these two regulatory properties are not understood. In this study we asked whether the two effects are dependent on its position in the protein and whether smaller regions from the R domain mediate the effects.

Translocation of the R domain to the C terminus did not prevent constitutive activity. These results suggest that different parts of the phosphorylated R domain can stimulate activity and that their location within the protein is not critical.

Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dulhanty A.M. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Hung L.-W.

Within this region, we found that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates three serines (residues 737, 795, and 813) in intact cells to regulate channel activity (7Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Picciotto and colleagues (8Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that these residues plus residue 700 were phosphorylated in vivo. Outside this region, Ser-660 is phosphorylated by PKA and contributes to channel regulation (7Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 8Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of CFTR variants in which the phosphoserines have been mutated to alanine show that phosphorylation of multiple R domain serines contributes to regulation, although no one serine is required for activity (for reviews see Refs. 1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar and 2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Further insight into R domain structure and function has come from studies in which the R domain has been deleted. Such studies have suggested that the R domain may have two functions as follows: the unphosphorylated R domain may prevent constitutive activity (i.e. opening in the presence of ATP alone), and the phosphorylated R domain may stimulate activity. Speculation that the unphosphorylated R domain prevents constitutive activity has been based primarily on studies of CFTR in which residues 708–835 have been deleted. Expression of this variant generated a channel that was constitutively open; only ATP was required for activity, and PKA-dependent phosphorylation was not required (9Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Ma J. Zhao J. Drumm M.L. Xie J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28133-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Larger deletions that extended the N terminus of residue 708 failed to generate channels, likely because of a severe disruption of structure (3Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar). There have been only two reports of a smaller deletion, and although the portion deleted was similar in the two studies, the results were different (11Vankeerberghen A. Lin W. Jaspers M. Cuppens H. Nilius B. Cassiman J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14988-14998Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Xie J. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The R domain can also stimulate channel activity. Addition of a phosphorylated recombinant R domain protein stimulated activity of CFTR in which residues 708–835 were deleted. Phosphoproteins consisting of residues 645–834, 590–858, and 708–831 each stimulated Cl− current (6Ostedgaard L.S. Baldursson O. Vermeer D.W. Welsh M.J. Robertson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5657-5662Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Ma J. Zhao J. Drumm M.L. Xie J. Davis P.B. J. Biol.

Thus it appears that the R domain may both prevent constitutive activity and, when phosphorylated, stimulate activity. However, it is not clear whether different portions of the R domain mediate these functions. To investigate these functions, we took two approaches; we deleted portions of the R domain, and we translocated portions of the R domain to the C terminus of the channel. We then asked how constitutive and stimulated activity were affected. The catalytic subunit of PKA was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and ATP from Sigma. Protein phosphatase 2Cα was expressed and purified as described previously (14Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For patch clamp studies, the pipette (external) solution contained (in mm) the following: 140N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 MgCl2, 5 CaCl2, 100 l-aspartic acid, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, with HCl (Cl− concentration, 50 mm). The bath (cytosolic) solution contained (in mm) the following: 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 3 MgCl2, 1 Cs-EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, with HCl (Cl−concentration, 140 mm). CFTR deletion mutants were constructed in the pTM1-CFTR4/S660A plasmid (in which Ser-660 is mutated to alanine) as described previously (15Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To make ΔR-C(709–835), ΔR-C(709–759), and ΔR-C(760–835), a unique MluI site was inserted in the plasmid encoding CFTR-ΔR/S660A using the method of Kunkel (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The inserts encoding R domain fragments (709–835, 709–759, and 760–835) were generated by polymerase chain reaction from wild-type CFTR with flankingMluI sites. These fragments were then inserted into theMluI site in CFTR-ΔR/S660A, preserving the C-terminal amino acid sequence DTRL. Constructs were verified by restriction digest, sequencing through insertions, and by in vitrotranscription and translation assays. The amino acid sequences of the variants are shown schematically in Fig. 1. All of the variants contained the S660A mutation and an intact Ser-700. We transiently expressed wild-type and mutant CFTR in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 hybrid expression system described previously (15Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were studied 4–24 h after transfection depending on the level of expression desired. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from soluble lysates of HeLa cells with an antibody that recognizes the C-terminal amino acids (1477–1480). The antibody-CFTR complex was labeled by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, as described previously (17Ostedgaard L.S. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26142-26149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methods for excised inside-out patch clamp recordings are similar to those described previously (18Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant CFTR channels were phosphorylated with 1 mm ATP, and 75 nm PKA was added to the bath solution. Bath was maintained at 35–37 °C by a temperature-controlled microscope stage (Brook Industries, Lake Villa, IL). Pipette resistance was 4–10 MΩ, and seal resistance was 2–25 GΩ. An Axopatch 200-A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for voltage clamping and current amplification. The pClamp 6.0.3 software package (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Data were recorded on digital audiotape (DTR-1203, Biological Science Instruments, Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA). When recording from patches containing multiple channels, data were filtered at 1 kHz using a variable 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 2 kHz. Membrane voltage was held at −40 mV, referenced to the external surface of the membrane patch. Data points during time course experiments are mean current values during 10-s sweeps. Average current for an intervention was determined as the average of the last 2–5 min of that intervention. For single channel analysis, data were filtered at 1 kHz using a variable 8-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 5 kHz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. Open state probability (P o) was determined from patches containing 1–3 channels, and the number of channels in a patch was determined by the greatest number of simultaneously open channels observed during the entire experiment. Values are presented as means ± S.E. An unpaired Student's t test and analysis of variance were used for assessment of statistical significance. Values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. In the presence of ATP, wild-type CFTR generates little current until it is phosphorylated with PKA (Fig. 2 A) (1Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Earlier studies showed that when residues 708–835 were deleted, channels were constitutively active, producing current without phosphorylation in the presence of ATP alone (9Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Subsequent addition of PKA further increased current. As observed previously (15Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when Ser-660 was mutated to alanine in that construct, Δ708–835 (see Fig.1), the channel functioned in a constitutive, ATP-dependent, and PKA-independent manner (Fig. 2 C). A full-length CFTR with only the Ser-660 mutated (CFTR-S660A) generated no constitutive current but was stimulated by PKA (Fig. 2 B). Thus, Ser-660 is neither required to keep the unphosphorylated channel closed nor required for phosphorylation-dependent stimulation. Therefore, to avoid confounding effects due to phosphorylation of Ser-660, all of the constructs described here contained the S660A mutation (Fig. 1). For brevity, we do not include the S660A designation in the names of the channel variants. Δ708–835 also retains Ser-700. One study reported that Ser-700 is phosphorylated in vivo(8Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although another did not (7Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Wilkinson et al. (19Wilkinson D.J. Strong T.V. Mansoura M.K. Wood D.L. Smith S.S. Collins F.S. Dawson D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L127-L133PubMed Google Scholar) showed a small but significant increase in the concentration of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine required for half-maximal activation of channels with an S700A mutation expressed in Xenopusoocytes. Nevertheless, when residues 708–835 were deleted, the presence of Ser-700 seemed to have little functional effect (3Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar, 13Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays a minor role in regulating the variants we studied. To identify portions of the R domain that may prevent constitutive activity and that may contribute to phosphorylation-dependent stimulation, we deleted portions of the R domain. Deleting the first half of the R domain (Δ708–759) produced channels that were closed until PKA addition (Fig.2 D), whereas deleting the second half (Δ760–835) generated channels with constitutive activity (Fig. 2 E). These data suggested that a region between residues 759 and 836 prevented constitutive activity. Therefore, we further subdivided this region. Fig. 2, F and G, shows that prior to PKA addition, Δ760–783 channels were open in the presence of ATP alone, and Δ784–835 channels were closed. Thus, whenever residues 760–783 were deleted (Δ708–835, Δ760–835, and Δ760–783), the channels were constitutively active, and when these residues were present (CFTR-S660A, Δ708–759, and Δ784–835) the channels were closed. These results suggest that this portion of the R domain contains sequences that prevent constitutive activity. Because a consensus site for PKA-dependent phosphorylation, Ser-768, lies within residues 760–783, we wondered if Ser-768 might be important in preventing constitutive activity. Phosphorylation of Ser-768 has not been detected in cells stimulated with cAMP agonists (7Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 8Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a CFTR-S768A mutant expressed in Xenopusoocytes showed half-maximal stimulation with a lower concentration of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine than wild-type CFTR, raising the possibility that Ser-768 might have an inhibitory function (19Wilkinson D.J. Strong T.V. Mansoura M.K. Wood D.L. Smith S.S. Collins F.S. Dawson D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L127-L133PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we mutated Ser-768 to alanine in the Δ708–759 and Δ784–835 constructs (Fig. 1). Neither of these channels showed significant constitutive activity (Figs. 2 H and 3). These data suggest that although residues between 760 and 783 were important in keeping the unphosphorylated channel closed, this function was not dependent on the presence of Ser-768. Constitutive activity and the response to PKA from multiple patches are shown in Fig. 3. With the exception of Δ708–835, PKA stimulated all the variants. Because each of these other channels retains at least a portion of the R domain and at least one of the in vivo consensus phosphorylation sites, these data suggest that phosphorylation of any one or two of these serines can stimulate activity. To understand better how portions of the R domain determine constitutive and phosphorylation-stimulated activity, we moved residues 709–835 from their normal location to the C terminus, producing ΔR-C(709–835) (Fig. 1). Fig.4 A shows that this protein was phosphorylated by PKA. In the presence of ATP alone, ΔR-C(709–835) was constitutively active (Fig. 4, B and C). Addition of PKA further increased current. Earlier studies showed that protein phosphatase 2Cα dephosphorylates and inactivates wild-type CFTR (14Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Luo J. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1397-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with phosphorylation-dependent regulation by the C-terminal R domain, addition of protein phosphatase 2Cα reduced current to prestimulation values (Fig. 4, Band C). We also studied patches containing 1–3 channels. Fig.5 A shows that ΔR-C(709–835) was constitutively active and phosphorylation further increased activity. The P o of this unphosphorylated channel was similar to that of unphosphorylated Δ708–835 (Fig.5 B). These results suggest that an R domain translocated to the C terminus does not prevent constitutive activity. However, because PKA increased P o (Fig. 5, A andB), the translocated, phosphorylated R domain retained its stimulatory function. Several studies have suggested that various portions of the R domain might differentially influence activity. For example, mutation of the various phosphoserines produces qualitatively and quantitatively different functional effects (13Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Wilkinson D.J. Strong T.V. Mansoura M.K. Wood D.L. Smith S.S. Collins F.S. Dawson D.C. Am. J.

Therefore, we attached smaller portions of the R domain to the C terminus (Fig. 1); this also reduced the number of phosphoserines. Fig.6 A shows that ΔR-C(760–835) was constitutively active, that PKA increased current, and that dephosphorylation with PP2Cα decreased current. ΔR-C(709–759) also showed constitutive and phosphorylation-stimulated activity (Fig.6 B). Thus both the first and second halves of the R domain retained PKA-dependent stimulatory activity. However, all three channels with R domain translocations were constitutively active (Fig. 7). These results suggest that, when translocated, the R domain loses the ability to prevent constitutive activity.Figure 7Current from CFTR with portions of the R domain translocated to the C terminus. Data are from membrane patches containing multiple CFTR channels. Data were obtained in the presence of ATP alone (shaded bars) or in the presence of ATP plus PKA (black bars). Data are mean ± S.E.,n = 7–10 for each variant. Asteriskindicates significant increase following addition of PKA (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 7 shows that all three C-terminal variants were regulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation. These results suggest that residues 709–759 and residues 760–835 both contributed to PKA-induced current in ΔR-C(709–835). As an additional test that it was serines 737, 795, and 813 that were responsible for PKA stimulation of ΔR-C(709–835), we mutated them to alanine (ΔR-C(709–835)/S3A, Fig. 1). Mutation of these three serines abolished PKA-dependent stimulation (Fig. 7). Phosphorylation will change the charge of the R domain. If the C-terminal R domain is influenced by the electrical field across the membrane, then voltage might affect the activity of ΔR-C(709–835) channels. Like wild-type CFTR (22Berger H.A. Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mulligan R. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1422-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Δ708–835 (15Rich D.P. Berger H.A. Cheng S.H. Travis S.M. Saxena M. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the current-voltage relationship of ΔR-C(709–835) was linear, both when unphosphorylated and phosphorylated (Fig.8). These results suggest that the function of the C-terminal R domain is not affected by the membrane electrical field. Previous studies have suggested that in the unphosphorylated state, the R domain may prevent constitutive activity, and when phosphorylated, it may stimulate channel activity. In the Introduction, we reviewed some of the evidence that supports these conclusions. In this study, we investigated these functions by deleting portions of the R domain and by translocating portions of the R domain to the C terminus. An advantage of this study is that we were able to examine multiple CFTR variants under well defined conditions, i.e. in excised inside-out patches of membrane with addition of ATP and PKA to the cytosolic surface. Moreover, for the variants in which portions of the R domain were translocated to the C terminus, the stoichiometry of channels to R domains was fixed at 1:1. Conversely, a limitation of our study is that the number of channels in a patch was not defined, and for only a few constructs did we measure P o. This limits our ability to compare activity between the various constructs. However, our interpretation does not depend on such an analysis. Earlier studies showed that deleting residues 708–835 generated a constitutively active channel (9Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Ma J. Zhao J. Drumm M.L. Xie J. Davis P.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20259-20267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that the N- and C-terminal portions of the R domain (residues 708–759 or residues 784–835) could be deleted without producing constitutive activity. However, residues 760–783 were critical for preventing constitutive activity; when they were deleted, channels opened without phosphorylation. These results suggest that a relatively small and specific portion of the R domain may keep the unphosphorylated channel closed. It is interesting that this small region did not contain a serine that is phosphorylated in vivo (7Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 8Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12742-12752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ser-768 is contained within this region, mutating it to alanine in either Δ708–759 or Δ784–835 was not sufficient to either produce constitutive activity or to prevent phosphorylation-stimulated activity. Two other studies each examined the effect of a single short deletion. Vankeerberghen et al. (11Vankeerberghen A. Lin W. Jaspers M. Cuppens H. Nilius B. Cassiman J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14988-14998Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) studied channels in whole-cell patches and found that deletion of residues 780–830 generated channels that were closed under basal conditions but opened when phosphorylated. This result is similar to our findings with Δ784–835. In contrast, Xie et al. (12Xie J. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) studied channels in planar lipid bilayers and reported that deleting residues 817–838 caused channels to be open without phosphorylation. Despite the presence of serines 660, 737, 795, and 813, they found that phosphorylation did not stimulate activity of this channel. The reason for the differences between these studies is not clear, but they may relate to differences in methodology (whole-cell and excised patches of membrane versus planar bilayers) or to differences in the constructs studied (the construct studied by Xie et al. (12Xie J. Zhao J. Davis P.B. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) deleted three residues, 836–838, that were not deleted in the other two studies). Because the data described above suggested that a portion of the R domain prevents constitutive activity, it seemed surprising that when we translocated residues 709–835 or shorter portions of the R domain to the C terminus, constitutive activity persisted. This was the case even though the translocated C-terminal R domain constructs were able to stimulate activity, suggesting that they had access to the rest of the channel. These data are also consistent with earlier findings that adding exogenous unphosphorylated portions of the R domain (residues 645–834, 590–858, or 708–831) did not close the Δ708–835 channel (6Ostedgaard L.S.

It has been reported that an unphosphorylated R domain protein (residues 590–858) inhibits activity of wild-type CFTR studied in lipid bilayers (23Ma J. Tasch J.E. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the significance of this observation is unclear based on the results of two different types of studies. First, an isolated unphosphorylated R domain protein encompassing residues 645–834 did not reduce activity of wild-type CFTR studied in excised membrane patches (13Winter M.C. Welsh M.J.

Second, as indicated above, addition of unphosphorylated R domain protein (either residues 645–834, 590–858, or 708–831) did not reduce activity of CFTR in which residues 708–835 were deleted (6Ostedgaard L.S.

Perhaps an explanation for the ability of residues 590–858 to inhibit wild-type CFTR (23Ma J. Tasch J.E. Tao T. Zhao J. Xie J. Drumm M.L. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7351-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is that portions of the protein corresponding to NBD1 may have inhibited activity. Further work is needed to understand the mechanism. It is possible that R domain deletions might lead to a constitutively active channel by inducing nonspecific structural changes. This might explain why an R domain translocated to the C terminus did not close the unphosphorylated channel. However, nonspecific structural changes seem unlikely given our finding that much of the domain can be deleted without causing the channel to open. The observation that the region responsible for keeping the channel closed may be fairly small (involving residues 760–783) suggests a more specific mechanism. Future studies focused on this small region of the R domain may help elucidate the molecular mechanism. Our data extend the earlier observations that exogenous addition of phosphorylated R domain proteins, either residues 645–834, 590–858, or 708–831 (6Ostedgaard L.S. Baldursson O. Vermeer D.W.

Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), stimulated channel activity. Here we found that the R domain retained its capacity for phosphorylation-stimulated activity when it was moved from its normal location to the C terminus. This ability to translocate a domain that regulates activity from one place in a channel protein to another has also been observed in the CIC2 channel (24Grunder S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We also found that when we split the R domain into halves (residues 709–759 and 760–835) and attached them to the C terminus, PKA continued to stimulate the channel. These data indicate that the R domain contains more than one region that can stimulate activity; no one specific phosphoserine or unique sequence is required. It is also interesting that the regions responsible for phosphorylation-mediated stimulation may be different from those that prevent constitutive activity, perhaps suggesting different mechanisms. This suggests that the mechanisms that prevent constitutive activity may differ from those by which phosphorylation stimulates activity. We recently showed that the R domain is primarily random coil in solution (6Ostedgaard L.S. Baldursson O. Vermeer D.W. Welsh M.J. Robertson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5657-5662Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our current work is consistent with the conclusion that the R domain does not form a region with a highly ordered tertiary structure. We found that it was not necessary to add the entire R domain to stimulate activity; portions of the R domain (residues 709–759 and 760–835) attached to the C terminus stimulated activity on addition of PKA. Moreover, portions of the R domain (residues 708–759, 708–783, and 760–835) remaining in our deletion mutants retained the capacity to mediate phosphorylation-stimulated activity. If the R domain had a well ordered tertiary structure that was required for activity, it seems likely that such alterations would disrupt its stimulatory activity. We speculate that short regions of sequence around the phosphoserines interact with and stimulate the rest of the channel. In addition, it is possible that sequences within the R domain associate with the rest of CFTR and in so doing adopt local regions of ordered tertiary structure. Recent data also suggest that an interaction between the R domain (residues 708–835) and the N terminus of CFTR has a stimulatory effect (25Naren A.P. Cormet-Boyaka E. Fu J. Villain M. Blalock J.E. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L. Science. 1999; 286: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is possible that some or all of the variants we constructed retain such an interaction. However, if this interaction is required for stimulation, the data suggest that the N terminus can interact with multiple regions within the R domain. A domain that is predominantly random coil is also consistent with our data on constitutive activity. We found that despite deletions of large portions of the R domain, the unphosphorylated channels remained closed. Only when residues 760–783 were missing did unphosphorylated channels open. These observations, pointing to a small region within a larger domain, can be explained by an R domain that exhibits considerable flexibility, although they do not exclude an R domain that folds into a well ordered tertiary structure. These data and the observation that the R domain is composed predominantly of random coil are both consistent with a model in which net phosphorylation-induced channel activity reflects the integrated effect of interactions with multiple sites in the R domain. In this way, graded phosphorylation could generate graded Cl−channel activity to control precisely transepithelial Cl−transport. Further understanding these interactions and identification of specific R domain binding sites in CFTR may yield additional insights into the complex regulation of CFTR.

It has been suggested that the CDK-inhibitor p27kip1 is a critical G1 phase cell cycle target of c-MYC. We show here that mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient for both p27kip1 and the related p21cip1 are still responsive to stimulation by c-MYC and can be arrested in G1 by a dominant negative mutant of c-MYC. This growth arrest can be overruled by ectopic expression of E2F or adenovirus E1A, but not by a mutant of E1A defective for binding to retinoblastoma family proteins. We show that fibroblasts with a genetic disruption of all three retinoblastoma family members (pRb, p107 and p130) are unresponsive to a dominant negative c-MYC mutant. These data indicate that p27kip1 is not the only rate limiting cell cycle target of c-MYC and suggest that regulation of E2F is also essential for c-MYC's mitogenic activity."

To date, very little is known regarding the transcriptional control of this gene or the majority of lysosomal enzyme genes.In a mini-gene model system, we have previously demonstrated that an ∼2.7-kb intron 1 of the human GAA gene contains a negative regulatory element (7Raben N. Nichols R.C. Martiniuk F. Plotz P.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we have employed an in vitro transfection assay in human hepatoma cells (Hep G2) and DNase I footprinting to localize the negative regulatory element within intron 1 to a 25-bp region ∼1.7 kb downstream from the exon 1/intron 1 boundary. Within this region there are two tandem E boxes and a potential core Ying Yang 1 (YY1) binding site in juxtaposition. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with specific antibodies showed that a transcriptional repressor Hes-1, the mammalian homologue 1 of D. hairy and Enhancer of split (E(spl)), binds to the downstream E box (CACGCG) and in collaboration with YY1 contributes to the repressive effect.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified and characterized a negative regulatory element of 25 bp within intron 1 of the human GAAgene, which is position- and orientation-independent. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analysis showed that transcriptional factors Hes-1 and YY1 collaborate to act as a transcriptional repressor of the human GAA gene in the Hep G2 cell line by binding to the element. Hes-1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor, binds to a C class E box site (CACGCG), and YY1 binds to a core YY1 binding site (ATAC) within the element.Hes-1 is a mammalian bHLH transcription factor related to D. hairy and E(spl). It belongs to a repressor gene family (12Fisher A. Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) that acts in opposition to the activator bHLH genes. The bHLH transcription factors have been divided into three classes based on the recognized E box sequences (CANNTG): canonical class A (CACCTG or CAGCTG), canonical class B (CACGTG or CATGTG), and noncanonical class C (CACGCG or CACGAG ) (12Fisher A. Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In Drosophila , the C class E box (CACGCG) is the optimal binding site for the hairy protein. E(spl) repressors prefer a canonical B class E box (CACGTG) over the class C core and a slightly different C class E box, which has been termed N box (CACNAG) (15Tietze K. Oellers N. Knust E. Proc.

Furthermore,hairy mediates transcriptional repression over a distance of more than 1.0 kb (20Barolo S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mice, Hes-1 can bind to C class E box (CACGCG), but it prefers the N box (CACNAG). Targeted disruption of theHes-1 gene in mice is lethal and leads to severe defects of the neural tube and arrest of T-cell development in the thymus (21Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar,22Tomita K. Hattori M. Nakamura E. Nakanishi S. Minato N. Kageyama R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas persistent expression of the Hes-1 gene prevents differentiation of mammalian neurons in the central nervous system and neural retina (23Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 24Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Although Hes-1 is essential to several developmental processes, few target genes have been identified particularly in humans. In mice, it has been shown that Hes-1 blocks neurogenesis by suppressing the expression of the MASH-1 gene (25Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), the mammalian homologue 1 of Drosophila achaete-scute gene that is essential for neural development (26Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In human hASH1 (humanachaete-scute homolog-1) expressing small cell lung cancers that do not express Hes-1, the introduction of Hes-1 results in a dramatic reduction of hASH1 mRNA through a direct binding of Hes-1 to a class C site within its promoter (11Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Here we present evidence that a completely different gene, the human lysosomal acid α-glucosidase gene, that is unrelated to the transcriptional activators is a downstream target of Hes-1. Furthermore, the C class E box binding site is located in the intron 1 of the GAA gene rather than in the promoter as in other targets. Hes-1 binds to a single C class E box site of the protected DNA region (5′-ATCTCATCTGCACGCGACATCCTTG-3′) within intron 1; the underlined E box and flanking sequences match closely with thehairy binding sequences (5′-GGCACGCGAC-3′) in the D. achaete gene promoter (18Van Doren M. Bailey A.M. Esnayra J. Ede K. Posakony J.W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2729-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the binding sequences of Hes-1, hairy, and E(spl) are conserved from Drosophila to humans. In addition, in the human GAA gene the Hes-1 binding site (1761–1785 bp from the exon 1/intron 1 boundary) is located more than 1.8 kb from the promoter region (5Martiniuk F. Bodkin M. Tzall S. Hirschhorn R. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicating that Hes-1 is a long range repressor in human cells.It has been demonstrated that the Hes-1 gene and its homologues are immediate downstream genes of the Notch signaling pathway from invertebrates to vertebrates (27Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 28Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notch is a transmembrane protein and is related to the proliferation and differentiation of many cell types (29Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4855) Google Scholar, 30Robey E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whether or not the humanGAA is involved in the signaling pathway needs to be further investigated.YY1, a C2H2-type zinc finger DNA-binding protein, is a multifunctional transcriptional factor that can act as an activator, a repressor, or an initiator-binding protein. The two most common binding core sequences are CCAT and ACAT (13Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that YY1 binds to the promoter and intron regions of housekeeping genes and can regulate their expression (31Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Antoine M. Kiefer P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that YY1 binds to one of the conserved sites (ACAT) within intron 1 of the humanGAA gene and functions as a partner of Hes-1 for repressive effect. The established mechanisms of repression by YY1 include activator replacement, interference with activator function, and recruitment of a corepressor (13Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that YY1 is acting in a new way by collaborating with Hes-1.In summary, we have demonstrated that the regulation and expression of the human GAA gene is in part controlled at the transcriptional level by a silencer element within its first intron. The identification of the transcription factors affecting the GAA expression may have another practical application. A majority of patients (∼80%) with a milder adult form of glycogen storage disease type II have a markedly reduced level of an entirely normal gene product as a consequence of a point mutation in the polypyrimidine tract of intron 1 (-13t-g) (7Raben N.

Pharmacological or genetic interference with either the binding of the transcriptional factors or the interaction between them may be used to up-regulate the gene expression. The lysosomal acid α -glucosidase (GAA,1 acid maltase, EC 3.2.1.20) hydrolyzes 1,4-α-glucosidic and 1,6-α-glucosidic linkages in glycogen, maltose, and isomaltose (1Jeffrey P.L. Brown D.H. Brown B.I.

Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar,22Tomita K. Hattori M. Nakamura E. Nakanishi S. Minato N. Kageyama R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas persistent expression of the Hes-1 gene prevents differentiation of mammalian neurons in the central nervous system and neural retina (23Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 24Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Although Hes-1 is essential to several developmental processes, few target genes have been identified particularly in humans. In mice, it has been shown that Hes-1 blocks neurogenesis by suppressing the expression of the MASH-1 gene (25Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), the mammalian homologue 1 of Drosophila achaete-scute gene that is essential for neural development (26Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In human hASH1 (humanachaete-scute homolog-1) expressing small cell lung cancers that do not express Hes-1, the introduction of Hes-1 results in a dramatic reduction of hASH1 mRNA through a direct binding of Hes-1 to a class C site within its promoter (11Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Here we present evidence that a completely different gene, the human lysosomal acid α-glucosidase gene, that is unrelated to the transcriptional activators is a downstream target of Hes-1. Furthermore, the C class E box binding site is located in the intron 1 of the GAA gene rather than in the promoter as in other targets. Hes-1 binds to a single C class E box site of the protected DNA region (5′-ATCTCATCTGCACGCGACATCCTTG-3′) within intron 1; the underlined E box and flanking sequences match closely with thehairy binding sequences (5′-GGCACGCGAC-3′) in the D. achaete gene promoter (18Van Doren M. Bailey A.M. Esnayra J. Ede K. Posakony J.W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2729-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the binding sequences of Hes-1, hairy, and E(spl) are conserved from Drosophila to humans. In addition, in the human GAA gene the Hes-1 binding site (1761–1785 bp from the exon 1/intron 1 boundary) is located more than 1.8 kb from the promoter region (5Martiniuk F. Bodkin M. Tzall S. Hirschhorn R. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicating that Hes-1 is a long range repressor in human cells.It has been demonstrated that the Hes-1 gene and its homologues are immediate downstream genes of the Notch signaling pathway from invertebrates to vertebrates (27Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 28Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notch is a transmembrane protein and is related to the proliferation and differentiation of many cell types (29Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4855) Google Scholar, 30Robey E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whether or not the humanGAA is involved in the signaling pathway needs to be further investigated.YY1, a C2H2-type zinc finger DNA-binding protein, is a multifunctional transcriptional factor that can act as an activator, a repressor, or an initiator-binding protein. The two most common binding core sequences are CCAT and ACAT (13Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that YY1 binds to the promoter and intron regions of housekeeping genes and can regulate their expression (31Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Antoine M. Kiefer P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that YY1 binds to one of the conserved sites (ACAT) within intron 1 of the humanGAA gene and functions as a partner of Hes-1 for repressive effect. The established mechanisms of repression by YY1 include activator replacement, interference with activator function, and recruitment of a corepressor (13Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that YY1 is acting in a new way by collaborating with Hes-1.In summary, we have demonstrated that the regulation and expression of the human GAA gene is in part controlled at the transcriptional level by a silencer element within its first intron. The identification of the transcription factors affecting the GAA expression may have another practical application. A majority of patients (∼80%) with a milder adult form of glycogen storage disease type II have a markedly reduced level of an entirely normal gene product as a consequence of a point mutation in the polypyrimidine tract of intron 1 (-13t-g) (7Raben N. Nichols R.C. Martiniuk F. Plotz P.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Huie M.L. Chen A.S. Tsujino S. Shanske S. DiMauro S. Engel A.G. Hirschhorn R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Pharmacological or genetic interference with either the binding of the transcriptional factors or the interaction between them may be used to up-regulate the gene expression. In this study, we have identified and characterized a negative regulatory element of 25 bp within intron 1 of the human GAAgene, which is position- and orientation-independent. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analysis showed that transcriptional factors Hes-1 and YY1 collaborate to act as a transcriptional repressor of the human GAA gene in the Hep G2 cell line by binding to the element. Hes-1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor, binds to a C class E box site (CACGCG), and YY1 binds to a core YY1 binding site (ATAC) within the element. Hes-1 is a mammalian bHLH transcription factor related to D. hairy and E(spl). It belongs to a repressor gene family (12Fisher A. Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) that acts in opposition to the activator bHLH genes. The bHLH transcription factors have been divided into three classes based on the recognized E box sequences (CANNTG): canonical class A (CACCTG or CAGCTG), canonical class B (CACGTG or CATGTG), and noncanonical class C (CACGCG or CACGAG ) (12Fisher A. Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In Drosophila , the C class E box (CACGCG) is the optimal binding site for the hairy protein. E(spl) repressors prefer a canonical B class E box (CACGTG) over the class C core and a slightly different C class E box, which has been termed N box (CACNAG) (15Tietze K. Oellers N. Knust E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6152-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Oellers N. Dehio M. Knust E. Mol. Gen.

Furthermore,hairy mediates transcriptional repression over a distance of more than 1.0 kb (20Barolo S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).
