https://openalex.org/W2162196924,"In a prospective-longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort, we tested why stressful experiences lead to depression in some people but not in others. A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (5-HT T) gene was found to moderate the influence of stressful life events on depression. Individuals with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-HT T promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals homozygous for the long allele. This epidemiological study thus provides evidence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual's response to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup."

Through homology searches of publicly available sequence data, we assigned tentative protein functions to 21,596 clones (75.86%). Mapping of the cDNA clones to genomic DNA revealed that there are 19,000 to 20,500 transcription units in the rice genome. Protein informatics analysis against the InterPro database revealed the existence of proteins presented in rice but not in Arabidopsis . Sixty-four percent of our cDNAs are homologous to Arabidopsis proteins."

We measured the orientational correlation time of water molecules in Mg(ClO4)2, NaClO4, and Na2SO4 solutions by means of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. The addition of ions had no influence on the rotational dynamics of water molecules outside the first solvation shells of the ions. This result shows that the presence of ions does not lead to an enhancement or a breakdown of the hydrogen-bond network in liquid water."

Recently, a T-type amino acid transporter was cloned which transports aromatic amino acids but not iodothyronines. This transporter belongs to the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family and is most homologous with MCT8 (SLC16A2). Therefore, we cloned rat MCT8 and tested it for thyroid hormone transport in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Oocytes were injected with rat MCT8 cRNA, and after 3 days immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of the protein at the plasma membrane. MCT8 cRNA induced an ∼10-fold increase in uptake of 10 nm<sup>125</sup>I-labeled thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>), 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), 3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine (rT<sub>3</sub>) and 3,3′-diiodothyronine. Because of the rapid uptake of the ligands, transport was only linear with time for <4 min. MCT8 did not transport Leu, Phe, Trp, or Tyr. [<sup>125</sup>I]T<sub>4</sub> transport was strongly inhibited by l-T<sub>4</sub>, d-T<sub>4</sub>, l-T<sub>3</sub>, d-T<sub>3</sub>, 3,3′,5-triiodothyroacetic acid, <i>N</i>-bromoacetyl-T<sub>3</sub>, and bromosulfophthalein. T<sub>3</sub> transport was less affected by these inhibitors. Iodothyronine uptake in uninjected oocytes was reduced by albumin, but the stimulation induced by MCT8 was markedly increased. Saturation analysis provided apparent <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> values of 2-5 μm for T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, and rT<sub>3</sub>. Immunohistochemistry showed high expression in liver, kidney, brain, and heart. In conclusion, we have identified MCT8 as a very active and specific thyroid hormone transporter."

Recently, naturally occurring peptidoglycan (PG) fragments were identified as the microbial motifs sensed by Nod1 and Nod2. Whereas Nod2 detects GlcNAc-MurNAc dipeptide (GM-Di), Nod1 senses a unique diaminopimelate-containing GlcNAc-MurNAc tripeptide muropeptide (GM-TriDAP) found mostly in Gram-negative bacterial PGs. Because Nod1 and Nod2 detect similar yet distinct muropeptides, we further analyzed the molecular sensing specificity of Nod1 and Nod2 toward PG fragments. Using a wide array of natural or modified muramyl peptides, we show here that Nod1 and Nod2 have evolved divergent strategies to achieve PG sensing. By defining the PG structural requirements for Nod1 and Nod2 sensing, this study reveals how PG processing and modifications, either by host or bacterial enzymes, may affect innate immune responses.

Peptidoglycan (PG) 1The abbreviations used are: PG, peptidoglycan; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; GM, GlcNAc-MurNAc; DAP, diaminopimelic acid; MDP, muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln); M-Di, muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu); DAPamide, meso-DAP (d)-monoamide; TriDAP, DAP tripeptide (l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP); M-TriDAP, meso-DAP-containing muramyl tripeptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; HEK293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cells.1The abbreviations used are: PG, peptidoglycan; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; GM, GlcNAc-MurNAc; DAP, diaminopimelic acid; MDP, muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln); M-Di, muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu); DAPamide, meso-DAP (d)-monoamide; TriDAP, DAP tripeptide (l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP); M-TriDAP, meso-DAP-containing muramyl tripeptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; HEK293T, human embryonic kidney 293T cells. is a major constituent of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria and consists of glycan chains of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) that are cross-linked to each other by short peptides, allowing the formation of a rigid polymer that surrounds the bacterial cell. During bacterial life cycle, peptidoglycan is constantly degraded by specific hydrolases, and newly synthesized subunits are integrated into the polymeric structure, allowing biological processes such as cell division. In Gram-negative bacteria, a thin layer of peptidoglycan is also found in the periplasmic space. Apart from the thickness and the degree of stem peptides cross-linking, an important difference between Gram-positive and Gram-negative peptidoglycans resides in the nature of the third amino acid of the peptides. In Gram-positive bacteria, this amino acid is commonly a lysine, whereas a diaminopimelic acid is found in most Gram-negative bacteria. Extensive analysis from many bacteria has revealed that, in steady state conditions, peptidoglycans from each bacterial strain have somehow fixed proportions of di-, tri-, tetra-, or pentapeptide substituted to the MurNAc sugar moiety. Nod molecules, including Nod1 and Nod2, are a family of intracellular pattern recognition proteins involved in bacterial detection (1Inohara N. Nuñez G. Nat. Rev.

Nod1 and Nod2 both sense peptidoglycan through the detection of different GlcNAc-MurNAc peptide fragments (also known as muropeptides). Nod1 detects the naturally occurring PG degradation product GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP (GM-TriDAP) (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). In contrast, Nod2 senses the muramyl dipeptide MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln, also known as MDP (5Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J. Chamaillard M. Labigne A. Thomas G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. J. Biol.

As a consequence, Nod2 is a general sensor of PGs from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria because MDP corresponds to the minimal motif found in all PGs. In contrast, the PG motif detected by Nod1, GM-TriDAP, is mostly found in PGs from Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting a specific role for Nod1 in innate immune responses against these bacteria. Therefore, specific PG muropeptides could be considered as a new class of pathogen-associated molecular patterns detected intracellularly by Nod molecules. During the course of a bacterial infection, the structure and muropeptide composition of PG is likely to be modified through the action of host and/or bacterial enzymes. For instance, SltY, a bacterial lytic transglycosylase involved in PG processing, is highly up-regulated during the infection of epithelial cells by Shigella flexneri (7Bartoleschi C. Pardini M.C. Scaringi C. Martino M.C. Pazzani C. Bernardini M.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the host side, lytic enzymes such as lysozyme or amidase degrade PG polymers. Therefore, to better understand the role of Nod molecules in innate immune defense following infection by various bacteria, it is necessary to define the PG structural requirements allowing detection by this class of pattern recognition molecules. For this purpose, we have analyzed the sensing specificity of Nod1 and Nod2 toward a large array of PG products and muramyl peptides, either occurring naturally or engineered synthetically. Our results provide new insights into the specific functions of Nod1 and Nod2 in PG detection during bacterial infections. Amino Acid Isomers—The ll and meso isomers of DAP were purified from the Sigma mixture according to van Heijenoort and Bricas (8van Heijenoort J. Bricas E. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1968; : 2828-2831Google Scholar). Any possible traces of the meso isomer present in the purified ll-DAP preparation were further eliminated by treatment with the DAP decarboxylase (LysA) in a reaction mixture (100 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm pyridoxal phosphate, 3 mmll-DAP, and pure His6-tagged LysA from Escherichia coli (13 μg). Incubation was performed for 3 h at 37 °C. l-Apm was obtained from the racemic compound according to Berges et al. (9Berges D.A. DeWolf Jr., W.E. Dunn G.L. Grappel S.F. Newman D.J. Taggart J.J.

The purity of the DAP, lanthionine, and cystathionine isomers could be assessed using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique after derivatization with the Marfey reagent (11Mengin-Lecreulx D.

Bricas E. Nicot C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1969; : 2743-2747Google Scholar) with HBr/acetic acid for 1 h. UDP-MurNAc Peptides—The chemical synthesis of UDP-MurNAc has been reported previously (14Blanot D. Auger G. Liger D. van Heijenoort J. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 252: 107-115Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala was synthesized from UDP-MurNAc using purified E. coli MurC synthetase (15Auger G. Martin L. Bertrand J. Ferrari P.

(17Flouret B. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). meso-Lanthionine- and l-allo-cystathionine-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptides were synthesized as described previously (12Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-ll-DAP was synthesized in a reaction mixture (100 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, 100 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm UDP-Mur-NAc-l-Ala-d-Glu, 1.5 mmll-DAP, and pure His6-tagged MurE from E. coli (80 μg). Similar conditions were used for the synthesis of UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Apm and UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-DAPamide, with l-Apm and meso-DAP (d)-monoamide (10 mm) replacing ll-DAP, respectively. Because of its different and more appropriate substrate specificity, the MurE enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus was used to generate l-Orn- or l-Lys-containing precursors. UDP-Mur-NAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Orn and UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys were synthesized in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu, 20 mml-Orn or l-Lys, and pure His6-tagged MurE from S. aureus (7 μg). In all cases, incubation was performed overnight at 37 °C. DAP- and l-Lys-containing UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptides were generated by the specific cleavage of the C-terminal d-Ala-d-Ala bond of the corresponding UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides by purified d,d-carboxypeptidase (PBP5) of E. coli, according to Templin et al. (18Templin M.F. Ursinus A. Höltje J.-V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4108-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In all cases, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of acetic acid, and the different nucleotide precursors were purified by HPLC on a Nucleosil 5C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using elution with 50 mm ammonium formate (eluent A) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. After an isocratic step at pH 3.15 for 22 min, a linear gradient of pH (from 3.15 to 5.1) was applied between 22 and 62 min. The identity of the nucleotide precursors was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. [M–H]– found for the ll-DAP-, l-Apm-, DAPamide-, l-Orn-, and l-Lys-containing UDP-Mur-NAc-tripeptides were (calculated values in parentheses) 1050.3 (1050.3), 1035.4 (1035.2), 1049.3 (1049.4), 992.4 (992.2), and 1006.2 (1006.3), respectively; values for the meso-DAP- and l-Lys-containing UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptides were 1121.6 (1121.3) and 1077.2 (1077.3), respectively. MurNAc Peptides and Derivatives—1-Phospho-MurNAc-tripeptide and dihydrouridine-diphospho-MurNAc-tripeptide were obtained from UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP by pyrophosphatase treatment and catalytic hydrogenation, respectively, as described by Michaud et al. (19Michaud C. Blanot D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MurNAc-peptides were generated by mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl, 100 °C, 10 min) of the corresponding UDP-MurNAc-peptides. They were then purified as a mixture of the two anomers α and β by HPLC. Lactoyl-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP was generated by treatment of the corresponding MurNAc-tripeptide with 4 m ammonium hydroxide at 37 °C for 5 h, followed by neutralization with one equivalent of acetic acid (20Auger G. van Heijenoort J. Blanot D. J. Prakt. Chem. 1995; 337: 351-357Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was then purified by HPLC on a Nucleosil 5C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using elution with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (eluent B) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (detection at 215 nm). Peptides— l-Ala-d-Glu was prepared according to Sachs and Brand (21Sachs H. Brand E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 4608-4610Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-X, l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-X-d-Ala, and l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-X-d-Ala-d-Ala (where X is meso-DAP or l-Lys) were obtained by treatment of the corresponding MurNAc-peptides with partially purified E. coli N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase according to the method of van Heijenoort et al. (22van Heijenoort J. Parquet C. Flouret B. van Heijenoort Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Dipeptide γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP was obtained by treatment of the tripeptide l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP with aminopeptidase M in a reaction mixture (100 μl) consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 1 mm tripeptide, and aminopeptidase M (Roche Applied Science; 200 units). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was complete as judged by the release of an equivalent of alanine and the appearance of a new peak corresponding to the dipeptide, which was detected with the amino acid analyzer. The different peptides were purified by HPLC (above conditions, using eluent B). Amino Acid Analysis—Amino acid and amino sugar compositions were determined with a Hitachi model L8800 analyzer (ScienceTec, Les Ulis, France) after hydrolysis of samples in 6 m HCl at 95 °C for 16 h. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction. The samples were prepared as follows. 1 μl of a solution of compound in water at 10–20 pmol/μl was deposited on the plate and mixed with 1 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution of 2,5-dinitrobenzoic acid in 0.1 m citric acid. After evaporation, desorption and ionization were obtained by pulses from a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Spectra were recorded in the negative ion mode at an acceleration voltage of –20 kV and an extraction delay time of 200 nanoseconds. A mixture of UDP-MurNAc, UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala, and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was used as an external calibrant. PG Purification, Enzymatic Digestions, and HPLC Analysis—PG from E. coli MC1061 was isolated and purified as described previously (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The experimental procedure used allows for the purification of insoluble polymeric PG. This material was digested with lytic enzymes including muramidase (mutanolysin; Sigma) and purified human serum amidase as described (23Mollner S. Braun V. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 140: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Digestions of 50 μg of purified PG with muramidase and amidase were done in 12.5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) containing 0.02% sodium azide and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.02% sodium azide, respectively. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg of mutanolysin and 25 μg of amidase, respectively. Bacillus subtilis PG muropeptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Cells and Reagents—HEK293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 105 cells/ml as described previously (24Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J.

Expression Plasmids and Transient Transfections—The expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged Nod1 was from Gabriel Nuñez (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI) and has been described previously (25Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen C. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for Nod2 was from Gilles Thomas (Fondation Jean Dausset/CEPH, Paris, France). Transfections were carried out in HEK293T cells as described previously (24Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). NF-κB Activation Assays—Studies examining the synergistic activation of NF-κB by PGs, muramyl peptides, and related compounds in cells over-expressing Nod1 or Nod2 were carried out as described originally by Inohara et al. (26Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with 10 ng of Nod1 or 30 ng of Nod2 plus 75 ng of Igκ luciferase reporter plasmid. At the same time, 1 μg of PG preparations or 10 pmol of muramyl peptides were added to the cell culture medium, and the synergistic NF-κB-dependent luciferase activation was then measured following 24 h of co-incubation. NF-κB-dependent luciferase assays were performed in duplicate, and data represent at least three independent experiments. Data show mean ± S.E. Analysis of the activation of Nod1 by HPLC fractions from B. subtilis PG was carried out as described previously (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). PG polymers can be degraded by two major classes of lytic enzymes. The first class includes bacterial autolysins such as muramidase and vertebrate lysozyme enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of the β-1-4 bond between GlcNAc and MurNAc in glycan strands to generate muropeptides. Amidases represent the second class of PG lytic enzymes that cleave the bond between the lactoyl group of MurNAc and l-alanine. We aimed to identify whether Nod1 and Nod2 could still detect PG following digestion by muramidase or amidase. To this end, PG from E. coli was purified. The addition of non-digested insoluble polymeric PG to Nod1- or Nod2-expressing HEK293T epithelial cells potentiates the Nod1- and Nod2-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway, as described previously. We then centrifuged the E. coli PG preparation and showed that the supernatant could not potentiate the Nod1 or Nod2 pathways, confirming that the PG motifs activating Nod1 and Nod2 are effectively present in the insoluble polymeric PG (Fig. 1A). The same centrifugation procedure was then applied to PG digested previously by amidase or muramidase. In this assay, the collected supernatant contains monomeric disaccharide units (muropeptides) in the case of muramidase treatment, and glycan-free peptides after amidase treatment. We observed that muramidase digestion of PG liberates soluble muropeptides that are detected both by Nod1 and Nod2 (Fig. 1A), a result that was expected because Nod1 and Nod2 detect GM-TriDAP and GM dipeptide, respectively. Surprisingly, amidase digestion of PG-liberated soluble fragments that were efficiently detected by Nod1 but not by Nod2 (Fig. 1A). PG from E. coli digested with muramidase was then chemically reduced using NaBH4 at alkaline pH. In such conditions, only the MurNAc moieties are reduced and lose their cyclic structure, whereas the linked amino acids remain unaltered. We observed that the chemical reduction of the PG sugar moiety abolishes Nod2 sensing, whereas Nod1 could detect both native and reduced PG fragments (Fig. 1B). Together, these results demonstrate that Nod1 and Nod2 display different specificities toward PG sensing. Although Nod1 sensing appears to rely only on the PG peptidic moiety, Nod2 requires an intact MurNAc group substituted to a peptidic chain. Moreover, these results suggest that amidases, produced either by the host or the bacteria, could affect the balance between Nod1- and Nod2-dependent PG sensing. To define the minimal PG motif detected by Nod1 and Nod2, several muramyl peptides, propionyl peptides, lactoyl peptides, and peptides were isolated or synthesized, and their purity was confirmed by several biochemical methods, including reverse phase HPLC and amino acid analysis (Fig. 2A, see also “Materials and Methods”). Of note, the muramyl dipeptide used in this study is MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu (depicted in Fig. 2A as M-Di), whereas the commercially available muramyl dipeptide that was used in previous studies by our group and others is Mur-NAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln (MDP), in which the second amino acid is an isoglutamine residue. We chose to use M-Di rather than MDP, because d-Glu is more common than isoglutamine in PGs and because the other muramyl peptides of this study also contain d-Glu. These molecules were then analyzed for their ability to stimulate the Nod1- and Nod2-dependent NF-κB pathway. We first observed that Nod1 detects neither M-TetraDAP nor M-Di but detects M-TriDAP efficiently (Fig. 2B). These results confirm our previous observations (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) that demonstrated that Nod1 detects a unique, naturally occurring muropeptide with a terminal meso-DAP, GM-TriDAP, and further show that the GlcNAc sugar group found in GM-TriDAP does not play a role in Nod1 detection. Moreover, the tripeptide l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP (TriDAP) activates Nod1 as efficiently as M-TriDAP does (Fig. 2B), which explains why amidase-digested PG is still detected by Nod1 (see Fig. 1A). We then tested peptides smaller than TriDAP (l-Ala-d-Glu and γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP) and free amino acids (l-Ala, d-Glu, and meso-DAP) and showed that the minimal motif detected by Nod1 is dipeptide γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP (Fig. 2B). However, γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP is sensed by Nod1 with ∼3-fold less avidity than TriDAP in our assays, suggesting that the l-Ala residue present in TriDAP may be required for optimal detection of PG by Nod1. Moreover, equimolar addition of free d-Glu and meso-DAP is inactive in triggering Nod1, demonstrating that the bond between these two amino acids is critical for Nod1 sensing. Together, these results demonstrate that Nod1 detects PGs containing the motif (l-Ala)-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP in which the meso-DAP is in terminal position. These observations are in good agreement with a recent study from another group (4Chamaillard M. Hashimoto M. Horie Y. Masumoto J. Su Q. Saab L. Ogura Y. Kawasaki A. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Valvano M.A. Foster S.J. Mak T.W. Nuñez G. Inohara N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) that used a strategy of chemical synthesis to demonstrate that γ-isoGln-meso-DAP is the minimal PG motif detected by Nod1. Interestingly, d-Glu and meso-DAP amino acids are absent from eukaryotes, and γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP therefore represents a very simple signature of bacterial origin. Surprisingly, we also observed that Nod1 detects lactoyl-TriDAP only weakly, even though this compound contains the motif (l-Ala)-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP with a terminal meso-DAP (Fig. 2B). Dose-response analysis revealed that lactoyl-TriDAP is sensed by Nod1 with ∼10-fold less avidity than GM-TriDAP, M-TriDAP, or TriDAP (data not shown) in our assays, and the reason for this discrepancy remains obscure. We next investigated which of these compounds could be detected by Nod2. As expected, none of the molecules lacking the MurNAc sugar moiety could activate Nod2 efficiently (Fig. 2B). In agreement with our previous results (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), we observed that Nod2 detects muramyl dipeptide (M-Di in this study, but MDP in previous work, Ref. 5Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J. Chamaillard M. Labigne A. Thomas G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8869-8872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar) but does not detect M-TriDAP or M-TetraDAP (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the fact that Nod2 detects M-Di as well as MDP demonstrates that amidation of the second amino acid does not significantly influence the ability of Nod2 to detect muramyl dipeptides. The above results, together with our previous observations, suggest a critical role for a terminal meso-DAP residue in Nod1-dependent detection of PG. To identify critical parts of the meso-DAP molecule that are required for efficient Nod1 sensing, we purified eight muramyl tripeptides differing only in the nature of the third amino acid (Fig. 3A; see “Materials and Methods” for procedures leading to their isolation). In addition to M-TriDAP, the only muramyl tripeptide detected by Nod1 is the structurally related M-TriLan (Fig. 3B), which is naturally present in PGs from some Gram-negative bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum. Indeed, meso-lanthionine differs from meso-DAP only by the replacement of the central carbon atom by a sulfur (see Fig. 3A). All the other muramyl tripeptides were not (or weakly) sensed by Nod1 (Fig. 3B), showing the requirement of the following: (i) the carboxyl group substituted on the Cϵ, because M-TriLys and M-TriDAPamide (a muramyl peptide naturally present in PGs from bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis) are not detected by Nod1; (ii) the length of the side chain, because the replacement of meso-lanthionine by its higher homologue, l-allo-cystathionine, an amino acid that could be incorporated in E. coli PG under special circumstances (10Richaud C.

J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leads to a muramyl tripeptide (M-TriCyst) that is detected with much lower avidity by Nod1; (iii) the amino group substituted on the Cϵ, because replacement of meso-DAP by l-aminopimelate abolishes detection by Nod1 of the non-natural muramyl tripeptide M-TriApm; and (iv) the spatial organization of the substituents on the Cϵ, because M-TriLL-DAP is only marginally detected by Nod1. Together with the above results (see also Fig. 2), these results demonstrate the importance of each group of meso-DAP for PG detection by Nod1, i.e. the Cϵ amino and carboxyl groups, the Cα amino and carboxyl groups (the amino group must be engaged into a peptide bond with d-glutamic acid and the carboxyl group should be free, because Nod1 does not detect M-TetraDAP), and the length of the side chain. These muramyl tripeptides were also tested for detection by Nod2. Surprisingly, we observed that Nod2 not only detects M-Di but also M-TriLys and M-TriOrn (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate the following three specific features of Nod2-dependent sensing of PG that differ from those of Nod1. (i) Nod2 detects muramyl peptides with a peptide moiety of variable length (either dipeptide or tripeptide if the third amino acid is l-lysine, l-ornithine, and, to a lesser extent, amidated DAP). (ii) The Cϵ carboxyl group abolishes Nod2 sensing, because Nod2 detects M-TriLys but neither M-TriApm nor M-TriDAP. Interestingly, the replacement of the Cϵ carboxyl group by a carboxamide group (in the case of M-TriDAPamide) only partially inhibits Nod2 sensing, suggesting that the lack of M-TriDAP sensing by Nod2 relies more on chemical properties of the Cϵ carboxyl group rather than on steric hindrance. (iii) The length of the third amino acid's side chain is not crucial for Nod2-dependent detection of PG, because Nod2 detects M-TriLys and M-TriOrn with comparable avidity. In the case of the detection of B. subtilis PG by Nod1, an apparent discrepancy could be identified between our previous observations (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and results by another group (4Chamaillard M. Hashimoto M. Horie Y. Masumoto J. Su Q. Saab L. Ogura Y. Kawasaki A. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Valvano M.A. Foster S.J. Mak T.W. Nuñez G. Inohara N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our assays we did not observe activation of Nod1 by B. subtilis PG, although equivalent amounts of S. flexneri PG were active (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the present observation that Nod1 does not detect M-TriDAPamide, a muramyl peptide found in B. subtilis PG (see Fig. 3B). In contrast, Inohara and co-workers reported activation of Nod1 by B. subtilis PG (4Chamaillard M. Hashimoto M. Horie Y. Masumoto J. Su Q. Saab L. Ogura Y. Kawasaki A. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Valvano M.A. Foster S.J. Mak T.W. Nuñez G. Inohara N. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). To clarify this question, we analyzed the detection of B. subtilis PG by Nod1 in further detail. We first observed that, whereas 1 μg/ml B. subtilis PG could not stimulate Nod1 as we reported previously (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), increasing the PG concentration up to 5 μg/ml allows a moderate activation of Nod1 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, even 5 μg/ml S. aureus PG is unable to activate Nod1 (Fig. 4A). By comparison with PG from a Gram-negative bacterium such as S. flexneri, we observed that ∼10-fold more B. subtilis PG is required to activate Nod1 to a similar extent (Fig. 4A, and data not shown). We then isolated individual muropeptides from B. subtilis PG by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 4B). Each fraction was then tested for activation of Nod1 (Fig. 4C). Although fraction 2, which corresponds to GM-TriDAPamide, was inactive, a minor fraction (fraction 1) corresponding to the canonical GM-TriDAP could efficiently activate Nod1 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, although a high proportion of B. subtilis PG is composed of muropeptides containing amidated DAP, trace amounts of classical DAP are also found incorporated in B. subtilis PG. This observation has been reported previously by Foster and co-workers, and the authors have shown that B. subtilis PG contains 20.5% GM-TriDAPamide and 3.3% GM-TriDAP (27Atrih A. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Williamson M.P. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3956-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results imply that B. subtilis PG is a weak inducer of Nod1 as compared with Gram-negative bacterial PGs, essentially because the DAP diamino acid is amidated to a high degree. During bacterial growth, PG precursors are synthesized in a highly regulated step-by-step biosynthetic pathway in which specific enzymes catalyze the progressive addition of amino acids to the growing muramyl peptide. During this process, the MurNAc sugar moiety is covalently linked through its C1 carbon to an uridine diphosphate group (Fig. 5A). We aimed to investigate whether the addition of a UDP group to the Mur-NAc moiety could affect detection of muramyl peptides by Nod1 or Nod2. To this end, UDP-MurNAc peptides of different lengths, which are encountered in Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacterial biosynthetic pathways, were purified. Of note, UDP-M-TetraDAP or UDP-M-TetraLYS do not exist as biosynthetic intermediates, because the last two amino acids of the pentapeptide chain (generally d-Ala-d-Ala) are directly added as a block to a UDP-M-Tri precursor by the MurF synthetase. Nod1 detected both M-TriDAP and UDP-M-TriDAP (Fig. 5B), indicating that the addition of a UDP group to the MurNAc moiety does not affect the ability of Nod1 to detect M-TriDAP. This result was expected, because the sugar moiety is dispensable for Nod1 to achieve PG sensing. In addition, the UDP group does not affect the ability of Nod2 to detect M-Di or M-TriLys (Fig. 5C) or M-TriOrn (data not shown). Surprisingly, although Nod2 does not detect M-TriDAP, it senses UDP-M-TriDAP as well as MDP or M-TriLys (Fig. 5C). To investigate how the addition of an UDP group to the MurNAc moiety affects detection by Nod2, UDP groups from UDP-M-Di and UDP-M-TriDAP were modified to generate the corresponding 1-phospho-MurNAc peptides and dihydrouridine-diphospho-MurNAc-peptides. Using these products, we could demonstrate that the phospho group covalently linked to the C1 of MurNAc is sufficient to render Nod2 sensitive to M-TriDAP-type muramyl peptide (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we hypothesize that these phosphate groups may form direct electrostatic interactions with the Cϵ carboxyl group present on the meso-DAP residue. Indeed, the presence of a UDP group modulates the ability of Nod2 to sense M-TriDAP and M-TriApm but not M-TriLys (Fig. 5E). Together, these results show that the addition of a UDP group on the MurNAc sugar moiety modulates Nod2-but not Nod1-dependent sensing of muramyl peptides. Recent progress has been made in the characterization of the role of intracellular bacterial sensing by Nod molecules in innate immunity. Nod1 plays a crucial role as a sentinel inside epithelial cells, the first line of defense against pathogens, because intestinal epithelial cells from Nod1-deficient mice are insensitive to bacterial products delivered into their cytosol (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jéhanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.-K. Labigne A. Zaehringer U. Coyl A.J. Di Stefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). In the case of Nod2, genetic evidence has shown that patients with mutations in Nod2 display a strong susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a disorder characterized by a chronic inflammation of the bowel (28Hugot J.P.

The characterization of the PG structural requirements allowing Nod-dependent detection is a critical step toward understanding the specific roles of Nod1 and Nod2 in an innate immune defense against bacteria. First, we have demonstrated that Nod1 and Nod2 detect both PG degradation products (muropeptides) and biosynthesis precursors (UDP-MurNAc-peptides). Our results have identified UDP-M-TriDAP as the first example of a compound detected by both Nod1 and Nod2, suggesting the possibility of an overlapping function of Nod1 and Nod2 in the detection of PG biosynthesis products from Gram-negative bacteria. Second, our results suggest that amidases (produced either by bacteria or the host) can tip the balance toward Nod1-dependent sensing, which may impact on the host response to infection. Recently, the nature of the mammalian serum amidase has been identified as PGRP-L (31Gelius E. Persson C. Karlsson J. Steiner H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 306: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This suggests that PGRP-L might play a key role in orchestrating the specific activation of Nod1 at the expense of Nod2. Third, we have demonstrated that Nod1 is unable to detect PGs from Gram-negative bacteria having l-ornithine instead of meso-DAP. Interestingly, some pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema spp., which often elicit a weak inflammatory response, display l-ornithine instead of meso-DAP in their PG. The presence of ornithine may then represent an escape mechanism important for the pathogenicity of these spirochetes. Finally, because bacteria can modulate the composition of their PG during infections, understanding the muropeptide subsets detected by Nod1 and Nod2 will allow for the definition of which PG modifications can be associated with immune escape. We thank Claudine Parquet for providing purified E. coli N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase."

N-Glycans on newly synthesized proteins are necessary for interactions with ER folding chaperones like calnexin or calreticulin, and for recognition by quality control mannosidase-like proteins prior to exit from the ER (for review see Refs. 15Helenius A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). N-Glycans on mature proteins generally stabilize the folded state and protect the protein core from protease digestion. Most N-glycans on glycoproteins that transit the Golgi complex during delivery to the cell surface are modified from a high mannose type to a complex type by a series of enzymatic steps. One distinguishing feature for these two types of N-glycans is whether they can be removed from the isolated protein by in vitro treatment with endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In general, N-glycans on proteins prior to their delivery to the medial Golgi complex are substrates for Endo H, and N-glycans on proteins after passing this point are not substrates. However, not all N-glycans are modified during transit through the Golgi complex, and these N-glycans remain sensitive to treatment with Endo H. ENaC is apparently delivered to the cell surface via the Golgi complex because surface delivery is blocked by treatment of cells with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A that disrupts cytosolic coat assembly needed for vesicle budding throughout the Golgi complex (9Weisz O.A.

Interestingly, the reported Endo H-resistant forms of the α-subunit exhibit a significantly faster mobility on SDS-PAGE (i.e. lower M r) consistent with proteolysis (10Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H.

Double tagged α- and γ-ENaC with amino-terminal HA and carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope tags (HA-α-V5 and HA-γ-V5) were cloned into pCDNA3.1-hygromycin. All vectors were purchased from Invitrogen. The new “muc” epitope tag (SAPDTRPAPGS) was developed from the immunodominant tandem repeat of human MUC1 (23Jerome K.R. Barnd D.L. Bendt D.M. Boyer C.M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. McKenzie I.F.C.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of ENaC epitope-tagged subunits expressed in CHO cells were carried out with mouse anti-V5 antibody from Invitrogen, mouse anti-Myc antibody (9E10) from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-HA antibody (HA.11) from Covance (Princeton, NJ), mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2) from Sigma, or mouse anti-MUC1 antibody (BC2) from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Immunoprecipitation of ENaC epitope-tagged subunits expressed in MDCK cells was carried out with the same antibodies, except that goat anti-V5 antibody conjugated to agarose (NB600–387A) from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) was used for the experiment described in Fig. 7. Immunoblotting of ENaC subunits from MDCK cells was carried out with mouse anti-Myc antibody (9E10) from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, mouse anti-V5 antibody from Invitrogen, and rat anti-HA (3F10) from Roche Applied Science. Affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rat IgG(H+L) second antibodies for all immunoblotting were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Wild type CHO and glycosylation-defective CHO (ldlD) cell lines were cultured as described previously (24Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Transient expression of mENaC subunit cDNAs was carried out in CHO and ldlD cells by infection with recombinant vaccinia virus (vT7CP) expressing T7 RNA polymerase, followed by transfection with expression vectors containing T7 promoters at the 5′ end of the cDNAs as described previously (25Ramsey-Ewing A.

Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 137-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The vT7CP was a gift from Bernard Moss (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Transfections were carried out with PolyFect Transfection Reagent as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), and cells were used the following day. MDCK type 1 cells were a gift from Barry M. Gumbiner (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). MDCK cells were transfected with mENaC cDNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells growing on plastic and transiently expressing ENaC subunits were used after 2 days, whereas clonal cell lines were selected in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (1:1) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (0.055 mg/ml hygromycin from Calbiochem, 5 μg/ml blasticidin from Invitrogen, or 0.3 mg/ml G418 from Invitrogen). Control and stably transfected MDCK cells were plated on 24-mm diameter 0.4-μm pore size transwell permeable supports (Costar, Corning, NY) for 5 days prior to use where indicated. The apical surface of MDCK cells was treated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) prior to extraction and recovery of biotinylated proteins with ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin (Pierce) as described previously (24Altschuler Y.

Sodium Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Wild type and epitope-tagged ENaC subunit cRNAs were prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The mENaC subunit cRNAs (1 ng per subunit) were injected into oocytes, and electrophysiological measurements were performed after 24 h as described previously (27Sheng S. McNulty K.A. Harvey J.M.

The difference in measured current in the presence and absence of amiloride (100 μm) was used to identify ENaC currents produced by different subunit combinations. Immunoblotting—Cells from 25-mm diameter dishes (12-well clusters) were extracted into 0.15 ml of lysis buffer (0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 63 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) for 20 min at room temperature. Protease inhibitor mixture set III from Calbiochem was added to the detergent mixture. Extracts were centrifuged for 7 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C to remove insoluble material, and supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel with the appropriate mouse monoclonal anti-epitope antibody and Protein G immobilized on Sepharose 4B beads from Sigma. Goat anti-V5 conjugated to agarose was used for immunoprecipitations described in Fig. 7. Where indicated, subunits were dissociated with SDS from Bio-Rad, prior to immunoprecipitation, by scraping cells into buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.6, 5 mm EDTA) prior to addition of SDS to 0.5% and heating as described previously (28Breitfeld P.P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; : 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and beads were washed once with 1% Triton X-100 in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), once with 0.01% SDS in HBS, and once with HBS. Beads were heated in sample buffer containing fresh β-mercaptoethanol (0.14 m β-mercaptoethanol) for 3.5 min at 90 °C prior to recovery of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE as described previously (24Altschuler Y.

Molecular weights (M r) of proteins were estimated using Precision Protein Standards from Bio-Rad. Proteins on the gels were electrophoretically transferred to 0.45-μm pore size Immobilon-NC membrane as described by the manufacturer (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Food Club, Topco Association, Inc., Skokie, IL) in blotting buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 80 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5). Membranes were incubated in blotting buffer with 1% non-fat dry milk and anti-epitope monoclonal antibody either for 2.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, followed by peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with antibodies, membranes were washed with multiple changes of blotting buffer. Peroxidase on the blot was developed and visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent from PerkinElmer Life Sciences as directed by the manufacturer with Kodak BioMax MR film from Eastman Kodak Co. Enzymatic Treatment of Immunoprecipitated ENaC—ENaC was immunoprecipitated from either stable or transiently transfected cells as described above. Immunoprecipitates of ENaC were treated with either Endo H from Applied Biosciences, Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase from Calbiochem, or N-glycanase/PNGase F from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) as directed by the supplier. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoblot Analysis of ldlD Cells—Transiently transfected ldlD cells expressing ENaC subunits in 25-mm dishes were incubated overnight with 25 μCi of d-[3H]galactose ([3H]Gal, 60 Ci/mmol from ICN, Irvine, CA) before extraction with lysis buffer (or SDS-buffer (28Breitfeld P.P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; : 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) and immunoprecipitation of subunits as indicated for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose as already described for immunoblotting, and [3H]ENaC subunits were visualized on the dried nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager TR screen. Where indicated, the nitrocellulose was subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis. Unlabeled GalNAc (100 mm) was added to the culture media with the [3H]Gal where indicated. In some cases, transiently transfected ldlD cells expressing ENaC subunits were incubated overnight with unlabeled Gal (10 mm), GalNAc (100 mm), both sugars, or no sugars prior to solubilization and immunoblot analysis of mENaC immunoprecipitates as described above. Peptide sequences representing epitope tags were added to the carboxyl terminus of the three subunits of mouse ENaC using standard recombinant DNA techniques. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a new epitope tag was designed from the immunodominant sequence of the human MUC1 tandem repeat and named muc. 2R. P. Hughey and T. R. Kleyman, manuscript in preparation. To determine whether co-expression of epitope-tagged ENaC subunits resulted in assembly of functional amiloride-sensitive sodium channels, various combinations of α-, β-, and γ-subunit cRNAs were injected into oocytes: α(HA) β(V5) γ(FLAG), α(Myc) β(V5) γ(muc), α(FLAG) β(FLAG) γ(V5), and α(HA) β(V5) γ(Myc). Amiloridesensitive sodium currents measured in oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp the following day indicated that all combinations of epitope-tagged subunits produce functional sodium channels with amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents in the range of 7–27 μA/oocyte, similar to whole cell currents we have observed with wild type ENaC (27Sheng S. McNulty K.A. Harvey J.M. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44091-44098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Li J. Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13867-13874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because these data indicate that the epitope-tagged αβγENaC subunits produced functional amiloride-sensitive sodium channels, they were used to study ENaC assembly and processing. The α-, β-, and γ-ENaC cDNAs were transiently expressed in CHO cells to determine whether the specific antibodies against the epitope tags could be used to immunoprecipitate individual subunits or co-immunoprecipitate subunits from assembled channels. The day following transfection, cells were extracted with lysis buffer, and ENaC subunits were immunoprecipitated with anti-epitope antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis as shown in Fig. 1. When expressed as individual subunits, no cross-reactivity between antibodies was observed. When all three subunits were co-expressed, subunit co-immunoprecipitation was observed indicating that channel assembly had occurred. For example, a band migrating at 95 kDa was observed when α was expressed alone and immunoprecipitated with anti-α antibodies. No 95-kDa band was found on the anti-α-immunoblot in immunoprecipitates using anti-β or anti-γ antibodies. However, the 95-kDa band was observed on the anti-α-immunoblot when αβγENaC was expressed in CHO cells, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti-α, anti-β, or anti-γ antibodies. A second faster migrating band (65 kDa) was found in the α-immunoprecipitate when all three subunits were co-expressed but not when αENaC was expressed alone (described in more detail below). The 65-kDa form of the α-subunit co-immunoprecipitated with the β-subunit but not with γ-subunit. In a similar manner, a 93-kDa band was immunoprecipitated by anti-γ antibodies but not anti-α or anti-β antibodies when γ was expressed alone. The minor sharp band at 75-kDa in the γ-immunoprecipitate represents the non-glycosylated γ-subunit because it was resistant to treatment with either Endo H or N-glycanase that releases N-glycans from glycoproteins (data not shown). A second more diffuse band at 75 kDa was found when all three subunits were co-expressed, and both the 93-kDa and diffuse 75-kDa bands co-immunoprecipitated with the α- and β-subunits. Broad diffuse bands for glycoproteins on SDS-PAGE usually result from microheterogeneity in N-glycan processing. A unique pattern of expression was observed for the β-subunit (Fig. 1). When expressed alone, the β-subunit produced a single 96-kDa band, but when expressed as αβγENaC, a second slower migrating 110-kDa band was observed for β. The 96- and 110-kDa bands were also co-immunoprecipitated with the α-subunit. Interestingly, the 110-kDa form of the β-subunit was not immunoprecipitated with the γ-subunit. The 110-kDa band was consistently observed on immunoblots only when all three subunits of ENaC were co-expressed, so it seemed likely that it represented processing of β-subunit glycans on the assembled channel during its transit to the cell surface. Two types of glycoprotein processing that occur within the Golgi complex that slow protein mobility on SDS-PAGE are modification of N-glycans from high mannose to complex type and addition of O-glycans. To determine whether glycan processing was responsible for the slower migrating β-subunit band, αβγENaC was expressed in a glycosylation-defective mutant of CHO cells (ldlD) that lacks the epimerase to convert UDP-Glc/GlcNAc to UDP-Gal/GalNAc (30Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This mutation effectively prevents synthesis of all mucin-type O-glycans with a GalNAc-Ser/Thr core as well as the formation of complex-type N-glycans that involves addition of Gal to terminal non-reducing GlcNAc residues. However, supplementing the media with Gal and/or GalNAc will reverse, or partially reverse, the phenotype of the epimerase deficiency in ldlD cells (30Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (left panel), only the 96-kDa β-subunit band was found in extracts of ldlD cells by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting when the β-subunit was expressed alone or as αβγENaC. Addition of Gal to the culture media, with or without GalNAc, resulted in expression of a doublet for the β-subunit with the appearance of the 110-kDa β-subunit band. The 110-kDa band was not observed when the media were supplemented with GalNAc alone. Because the presence of the 110-kDa band was not dependent on the presence of GalNAc in the media, this indicates that its appearance results from processing of N-glycans on the β-subunit of αβγENaC to complex type and not from addition of O-glycans. This was confirmed by finding that addition of [3H]Gal to the media of ldlD cells expressing αβγENaC, but not the β-subunit alone, produced a 3H-labeled 110-kDa band when immunoprecipitates were analyzed after SDS-PAGE using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 2, right panel). Labeling of the β-subunit in αβγENaC with [3H]Gal was not GalNAc-dependent indicating that [3H]Gal was being added to N-glycans and not to O-glycan GalNAc-Ser/Thr cores. Two additional 3H-labeled bands were also noted in the β-subunit immunoprecipitates migrating near the 75-kDa protein standard on SDS-PAGE. These 3H-labeled bands were also observed only when all three subunits were co-expressed. Because bands of similar size (65 and 75 kDa) were observed for both the α- and γ-subunits, respectively, by immunoblotting upon αβγENaC expression (see Fig. 1), additional experiments were carried out to determine whether these 3H-labeled bands were processed forms of the α- and γ-subunits. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitation of either the α-, β-, or γ-subunit of ENaC from ldlD cells transiently expressing αβγENaC and labeled overnight with [3H]Gal produced the same three 3H-labeled bands. 3H labeling of the three bands was not dependent on the presence of GalNAc, consistent with N-glycan processing of these glycoproteins. Because it is clear that all three ENaC subunits will co-immunoprecipitate after extraction of cells in lysis buffer (see Fig. 1), immunoprecipitation was carried out after dissociation of ENaC subunits with SDS. As shown in Fig. 3B, immunoprecipitation of individual ENaC subunits after cell extraction in SDS produced a single 3H-labeled band (65 kDa for the α-subunit, 110 kDa for the β-subunit, and 75 kDa for the γ-subunit) corresponding to the three 3H-labeled proteins that co-immunoprecipitated when cells were extracted in standard lysis buffer under non-dissociating conditions (see Fig. 3A). Additional experiments were carried out to confirm that the 3H-labeled bands observed for the α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits represented forms with processed N-glycans. Either immunoprecipitates from CHO cells transiently expressing αβγENaC (Fig. 4) or streptavidin precipitates from surface-biotinylated MDCK cells stably expressing αβγENaC (Fig. 5) were incubated with either neuraminidase, endoglycosidase H (Endo H), or PNGase F (N-glycanase) to characterize the nature of the N-glycans on each band."
https://openalex.org/W2146152538,"Phosphate (Pi) is a putative cytosolic signaling molecule in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Here, by using a multiparameter monitoring system, we show that Pi controls oxidative phosphorylation in a balanced fashion, modulating both the generation of useful potential energy and the formation of ATP by F1F0-ATPase in heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria. In these studies the effect of Pi was determined on the mitochondria [NADH], NADH generating capacity, matrix pH, membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and cytochrome reduction level. Pi enhanced NADH generation and was obligatory for electron flow under uncoupled conditions. Pi oxidized cytochrome b (cyto-b) and reduced cytochrome c (cyto-c), potentially improving the coupling between the NADH free energy and the proton motive force. The apparent limitation in reducing equivalent flow between cyto-b and cyto-c in the absence of Pi was confirmed in the intact heart by using optical spectroscopic techniques under conditions with low cytosolic [Pi]. These results demonstrate that Pi signaling results in the balanced modulation of oxidative phosphorylation, by influencing both ΔG H+ generation and ATP production, which may contribute to the energy metabolism homeostasis observed in intact systems.

Pi oxidized cytochrome b (cyto-b) and reduced cytochrome c (cyto-c), potentially improving the coupling between the NADH free energy and the proton motive force. The apparent limitation in reducing equivalent flow between cyto-b and cyto-c in the absence of Pi was confirmed in the intact heart by using optical spectroscopic techniques under conditions with low cytosolic [Pi]. These results demonstrate that Pi signaling results in the balanced modulation of oxidative phosphorylation, by influencing both ΔG H+ generation and ATP production, which may contribute to the energy metabolism homeostasis observed in intact systems.

Because ADP and Pi are generated by ATPases in the cytosol, the potential roles of ADP and Pi as cytosolic feedback signaling molecules regulating the rate of ATP production was one of the first models of the cytosolic regulation of mitochondrial ATP production (1Chance B. Williams C.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lardy H.A. Wellman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 185: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, over the years it has become apparent that the cellular regulation of oxidative phosphorylation is a very complex control network, with numerous potential rate-limiting steps affected by a variety of signaling molecules, including ADP, Pi, Ca2+, creatine, and Mg2+ (3Ernster L. Lee C. Jnada S. Slater E. Kaniuga Z. Wojtczak L. Biochemistry of Mitochondria. Academic Press, London1966: 29-51Google Scholar, 4Tager J.M. Wanders R.J. Groen A.K. Kunz W. Bohnensack R. Kuster U.

J. 1992; 284: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 6Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 258: C377-C389Crossref Google Scholar, 7Brand M.D. Kesseler A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This network results in the ability of tissues to change significantly the rate of ATP generation without significantly modifying the metabolic intermediates coupled to many other processes in the cell. This has been termed an energy metabolism homeostasis (8Balaban R.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1259-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Toward a better understanding of this regulatory network, the effects of each putative signaling molecule on oxidative phosphorylation need to be characterized. The purpose of the current work was to further evaluate the effects of Pi on different regulatory sites of oxidative phosphorylation in cardiac mitochondria. Phosphate is believed to enter cardiac mitochondria via a neutral phosphate transporter (Pt) in exchange for OH- or by co-transport with H+ (9Wohlrab H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, Pi transport is linked to the mitochondrial inner membrane pH gradient (ΔpHm) and the phosphate concentration gradient but not to the membrane potential (Δψ). Although Pi transport has not been ascribed as a rate-limiting step for phosphate utilization in oxidative phosphorylation, this particular aspect of phosphate metabolism has not been extensively studied, especially in the intact cell conditions where the driving forces (matrix membrane gradient of pH and matrix [Pi]) are ill defined. With regard to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, Pi is a primary substrate for the phosphorylation of ADP by the F1F0-ATPase. In addition, Pi has also been implicated in modifying the free concentration of Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, via chelation, resulting in the modulation of these ions effects on mitochondrial metabolic processes (10Jung D.W. Apel L. Brierley G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Gunter T.E. Restrepo D. Gunter K.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C304-C310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11273-11279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pi also has been shown to increase the mitochondria volume (13Izzard S. Tedeschi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Izzard S. Tedeschi H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 154: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that could also lead to metabolic consequences (15Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the volume increase with Pi is complex, although likely involves the osmotic load of matrix [Pi] together with the enhancement of Δψ (via dissipation of ΔpHm (16Rottenberg H. Scarpa A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4811-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) through Pt activity) and electrophoretic uptake of K+ (17Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1194-C1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pi has also been suggested to affect the mitochondrial transition pore (18Kushnareva Y.E. Haley L.M. Sokolove P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Phosphate has been shown to affect directly dehydrogenases and other enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (19Rodriguez-Zavala J.S. Pardo J.P. Moreno-Sanchez R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The most notable effect was reported by Hansford and Chappell (20Hansford R.G. Chappell J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) who showed that Pi was obligatory for electron flow in isolated blowfly mitochondria. These potential multiple sites of action of Pi on oxidative phosphorylation suggest that Pi may play a much more complex role in this process than simply a substrate for ADP phosphorylation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that Pi regulates several sites in oxidative phosphorylation, in addition to its role as a substrate for the F1F0-ATPase. Specifically, we propose that Pi is one of the primary regulators of NADH generation. To test this hypothesis, isolated porcine heart mitochondria were used with simultaneous measurements of ATP synthetic rates, NADH, cytochrome redox potentials, ΔpHm, and Δψ during systematic alterations of the [Pi]. The results of these studies suggest that Pi is remarkably well suited to regulate oxidative phosphorylation on several levels, including the generation of NADH, the flow of reducing equivalents in the cytochrome chain, and as a substrate for ATP production. As a result of these multiple sites of action, Pi has the potential of providing the balanced activation of mitochondrial ATP production in the cytosolic network controlling oxidative phosphorylation. Porcine Heart and Skeletal Muscle Mitochondria Isolation—Heart mitochondria were isolated from in situ perfused porcine hearts as described previously (21Territo P.R. Mootha V.K. French S.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For comparison purposes, skeletal muscle mitochondria were prepared using the same protocol without in situ perfusion. The standard experimental buffer for these studies was buffer A, composed of 125.0 mm KCl; 15.0 mm NaCl; 20.0 mm K-Hepes; 1.0 mm KEGTA; 1.0 mm K2EDTA; 5.0 mm MgCl2;4 μm tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+), at pH 7.1. The pH needed to be titrated separately for room temperature and 37 °C. Phosphate was added as the K+ salt pre-titrated to pH 7.1. ATP was also added as the Na+ salt at pH 7.1. The free [Ca2+] was estimated as described previously (21Territo P.R. Mootha V.K. French S.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was generally held at 500-600 nm with CaCl2, unless specified otherwise. Measurements of Mitochondrial Oxygen Consumption (MV O2 ), NADH, and Δψ—Most experiments were conducted in a chamber (22Territo P.R. Balaban R.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that permitted simultaneous monitoring of mitochondria oxygen consumption (MVO2), NADH fluorescence, seminaphthorhodafluors (SNARF) fluorescence (matrix pH), aminonaphthylethenylpyridinium (ANEPPS) fluorescence (Δψ), light scattering (mitochondrial volume), and TPP+ distribution (Δψ) in a closed system at 37 °C. Some of the optical measurements could only be made in paired experiments, due to overlaps in excitation or emission spectra. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured by determining the decrease in oxygen tension in the chamber as a function of time. The oxygen electrode was standardized using room air (0.2 mm O2) and anoxia (0) generated by the mitochondria or the addition of sodium hydrosulfite. All data were digitized and stored using an analog to digital conversion system (DASYLab32) attached to a personal computer. The NADH fluorescence data were collected in the presence of a fluorescence reference standard, fluorescein dextran, to correct for both the primary and secondary inner filter effects (23French S.A. Territo P.R. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C900-C909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 100% NADH fluorescence signal was obtained at anoxia or in the presence of rotenone. The background fluorescence (100% NAD) was determined by incubating mitochondria, in the absence of carbon substrates, with ADP and Pi. ΔG NADH was calculated by using Equation 1, ΔGNADH=ΔGNADH0-((2.3RT/F)log(NADH/NAD))(Eq. 1) where ΔG NADH0 = -0.32 V, and 2.3 RT/F = 0.0616 (37 °C). ΔG NADH was calculated in mV to minimize the types of units used. Volts/mol can be converted to kcal/mol by multiplying the voltage data by 0.0427. The TPP+ distribution was determined with a TPP+-sensitive micro-electrode (World Precision Instruments, model KWIKTPP). Corrections for TPP+ binding to the mitochondria were made as described earlier (21Territo P.R. Mootha V.K. French S.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Matrix pH—The matrix pH was estimated from SNARF fluorescence trapped in the matrix space (24Baysal K. Brierley G.P. Novgorodov S. Jung D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SNARF was excited using the 532-nm line from a diode pumped laser (Power Technologies Inc., Little Rock, AR). The entire SNARF emission spectrum was collected using the PC-based rapid scanning spectrometer outlined above. Standard curves were generated using either Triton X-100 extracts of mitochondria or intact mitochondria treated with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (1 μm) and nigericin (1 μm). Both the Triton X-100 and FCCP/nigericin-treated mitochondria gave essentially identical titration curves, once the light scattering effects were eliminated using approaches published previously (23French S.A. Territo P.R. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C900-C909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From difference spectra between the acid and base solutions, the frequency optima for the acid and base forms of SNARF were determined at 580 and 638 nm, respectively. By using the calibration curves, the matrix pH (pHm) was estimated directly from the 638/580 nm intensity ratio. The extramitochondrial pH was held constant at 7.1, and thus the pH gradient across the matrix membrane (ΔpHm) was calculated by using Equation 2, ΔpHm=pHm-7.10(Eq. 2) By using the ΔpHm data together with Δψ, the proton motive force for the inner membrane can be calculated by using Equation 3, ΔGH+=Δψ-61.6mV(ΔpHm)(Eq. 3) It is important to express the driving force for ATP synthesis in terms of the ΔG H+, because ΔpHm or Δψ can compensate for changes in one element alone (for example see Ref. 16Rottenberg H. Scarpa A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4811-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Mitochondria Light Scattering—Light scattering experiments were performed by determining the transmission of multiple wavelengths through the mixing chamber, as described previously (25Territo P.R. French S.A. Dunleavy M.C. Evans F.J. Balaban R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2586-2599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A “white” light source (Ocean Optics) was impinged on the mitochondrial suspension via a fiber optic, whereas the transmitted light was directed to the same spectrophotometer used for the fluorescence measurements. Optical absorbance was calculated by taking the log of the ratio of transmitted light in the presence of buffer (I0) and in the presence of the suspension (I). The spectral characteristics were determined at the isosbestic frequencies of this suspension and summed. Mitochondria Optical Absorption Studies—To minimize the mitochondrial light scattering effects on the measurement of the optical absorbance properties, an integrating sphere was used with a center-mounted cuvette (1 × 1 cm) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model Lambda 800). Due to the configuration of this instrument, all experiments were conducted at room temperature, and no time courses were collected, because the sample had to be removed to make additions. By using this approach, all of the photons scattered by the sample were collected and analyzed. The only corrections necessary were for background absorbance and path length calibrations. This arrangement permitted the simultaneous monitoring of the entire UV and visible spectra of the mitochondria, from 310 to 700 nm. Quantitative analysis was performed by calculating the ΔA of peak absorbance (i.e. sample) versus a line drawn between two isosbestic reference points (i.e. reference) (26Balaban R.S. Soltoff S.P. Storey J.M. Mandel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 238: F50-F59PubMed Google Scholar). These wavelength combinations were as follows: cytochrome c (cyto-c) sample:550 nm and cytochrome b (cyto-b) sample:563 nm, both referenced between 535 nm and 575 nm; cytochrome a (cyto-a):sample 605 nm, referenced between 575 nm and 630 nm. No attempt to quantitate the reduction levels using the γ band was attempted, due to the overlap in the oxidized absorbance at ∼414 nm, which was shared by all of the cytochromes. The γ peaks were useful for a qualitative independent confirmation of the reduction level changes of the cytochromes, because the extinction differences between the oxidized and reduced cytochromes were roughly 10 times higher in this region. All optical absorbance data are reported as the % reduction level, as determined in Equation 4, &x0025;red=100×((cytoabs)-(cytoabs)ox)/((cytoabs)red-(cytoabs)ox)(Eq. 4) where cytoabs refers to the cytochrome sample absorbance value after base-line correction, using the reference points as outlined above. The same conditions were used to determine the fully oxidized (cytoabs)ox) and reduced (cytoabs)red) cytochromes as were used for NADH:NAD. Perfused Heart Optical Spectroscopy—The resting redox state of the mitochondrial cytochromes was determined in a Langendorf perfused heart preparation, as described previously (27Heineman F.W. Kupriyanov V.V. Marshall R. Fralix T.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H255-H267PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the rabbits were anesthetized by an IV injection of ketamine HCl (20 mg/kg) with acepromazine maleate (0.2 mg/kg) and were anticoagulated by an IV injection of heparin (2000 units). The hearts were arrested by an intravenous injection of KCl (4 mEq), quickly excised, and perfused at 37 °C with a modified high KCl Krebs-Henseleit solution composed of 115 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, 3.0 mm l-lactic acid, and 3.0 mm NaOH and gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The high KCl perfusate maintained the arrested condition, which minimized the motion of the heart and reduced the cytosolic Pi to the lowest values possible (27Heineman F.W. Kupriyanov V.V. Marshall R. Fralix T.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H255-H267PubMed Google Scholar). By using a bifurcated fiber optic (Oceans Optics), a white light source (Titan Tool, FO-150) was impinged on the free left ventricle wall of the heart. The reflected light was collected through the other fiber of the cable and directed to a rapid scanning spectrometer (Oceans Optics, PC2000) embedded in a personal computer. Optical spectra were continuously obtained from 300 to 700 nm. After collecting a base-line control, 1 μm KCN was added to the perfusate to reduce selectively the mitochondrial cytochromes without influencing the myoglobin oxygenation (see Ref. 28Balaban R.S. Mootha V.K. Arai A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cytochrome optical differences were calculated using the same procedures as outlined above for mitochondria. NADH Enzyme-dependent Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (ED-FRAP)—The NADH ED-FRAP method (29Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2018-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was used to measure the capacity of the mitochondria to generate NADH by summing all of the dehydrogenase activity using a previously described micro-photolysis system (30Joubert F.F.H.J. Wen H. Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). NADH ED-FRAP measures the dehydrogenase activity by rapidly photolyzing NADH to NAD+ and observing the rate of NADH re-synthesis. NADH ED-FRAP experiments were conducted at room temperature due to the complexity of the irradiation apparatus. To facilitate their correlation with other measurements, studies were routinely conducted by using a mitochondria suspension (1.6 ml) in a sealed water-jacketed chamber at room temperature. By using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI Inc.), the MVO2 was monitored in this well mixed chamber. When a steady state was attained, a 50-μl sample was removed from the chamber, injected into the small quartz cuvette, and immediately analyzed by the NADH ED-FRAP method (30Joubert F.F.H.J. Wen H. Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The NADH ED-FRAP studies were all performed in buffer A with 5 mm glutamate and malate (G/M) for carbon substrates and 500 nm free Ca2+. Rotenone was added to prevent any net flux or competing FADH-linked reactions in the NADH recovery process (29Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2018-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Joubert F.F.H.J. Wen H. Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The NADH fluorescence was continuously monitored in the 50-μl cuvette, using a fiber optic rapid scanning spectrophotometer (Oceans Optics) and a UV excitation source. Data are reported as the initial rate of NADH regeneration from NAD+ after photolysis. Two basic protocols were followed in this study. The first protocol was a dose-response of [Pi] on quiescent mitochondria (no net oxidative phosphorylation), performed by adding Pi in the absence of ADP. ADP was then added to evaluate the active state during net ATP synthesis. The second protocol involved adding ADP first and then performing a dose-response of [Pi] to activate ATP production. These two protocols permitted the separation of the individual effects of these key substrates for the F1F0-ATPase reaction. Effects of P i on “Quiescent” Mitochondria—The effects of the Pi on the resting [NADH], Δψ, and ΔpHm in the absence of ADP were determined. An example from this series is presented in Fig. 1A, with the data summarized in Table I. The mitochondria were initially energized with 5 mm G/M at the time indicated. The addition of G/M increased [NADH] and ΔpHm, hyperpolarized Δψ (net increase in calculated ΔG H+), and increased MVO2, consistent with the energization of the inner membrane by the G/M-supported dehydrogenase activity. The increase in MVO2 is likely due to an increase in the leak current, due to the hyperpolarization (31Harper M. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14850-14860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pi (3 mm) increased the [NADH], decreased ΔpHm, hyperpolarized Δψ, and increased MVO2. The calculated ΔG H+ increased despite the reduction in ΔpHm due to the Pt activity (Table I).Table IEffects of Pi and ADP on heart mitochondriaG/M (control)PiaPi added to resting mitochondria (Fig. 1).

Open table in a new tab These results are inconsistent with an activation of the F1F0-ATPase activity by Pi in conjunction with the residual ADP in the matrix, because that would have depolarized Δψ and decreased the [NADH] as well as ΔG H+. In several experiments (∼30%), the resting NADH levels were nearly >90% reduced after the G/M addition, resulting in much smaller, but qualitatively similar, effects of Pi on the NADH levels. This was accompanied by the very low resting respiratory rates, suggesting that these particular preparations had exceedingly low leak values resulting in the high resting NADH levels. These preparations were not significantly different from other preparations with regard to all of the measured parameters in the active (i.e. presence of ADP and Pi) condition, where the membrane resistance was dominated by the F1F0-ATPase activity. The dose-response curves for Pi on resting NADH (normalized) and Δψ are presented in Fig. 1C. The normalization of the NADH concentration was required, due to the sensitivity of the resting conditions to small variations in inner membrane leakage from preparation to preparation as discussed above. Data were modeled as a simple exponentially increasing function with the form shown in Equation 5, Y=a+b(1-e-[Pi]/Kp)(Eq. 5) The K p for Pi was 0.56 mm for [NADH] and 0.47 mm for Δψ. No significant improvement in the fit was obtained by using multiexponential functions. The effect of Pi was different from that of ADP, the other substrate for the F1F0-ATPase. The addition of ADP (1.3 mm), in the absence of Pi, resulted in a decrease in the [NADH], an increase in ΔpHm, a slight depolarization of Δψ, and a decrease in ΔG H+, whereas MVO2 decreased (Fig. 2A and Table I). The sustained oxidation of NADH, as well as the slight reduction in ΔG H+, is consistent with the removal of a small amount of residual Pi from the bath and the mitochondrial matrix by the active phosphorylation of ADP, resulting in the decrease in the dehydrogenase activity observed in the previous study. The ADP-induced decrease in Δψ is probably due to the electrogenic nature of the adenylate translocase dissipating the Δψ but is compensated by an increase in ΔpHm. In summary, ADP does not mimic the effects of Pi on mitochondrial metabolism and in many ways results in opposite net metabolic effects. Effects of P i on the Maximum Rate of ATP Synthesis—The effects of Pi on mitochondrial metabolism were evaluated at the maximum rate of ATP production. Examples of these studies are presented in Figs. 1 and 3, in which both ADP and Pi are present. The order of addition of ADP or Pi had no measurable effect on the steady state processes, and the data are combined in Table I, but the approaches to this new steady state under the two conditions are revealing. The maximum rate of ATP production was estimated from the initial rate of respiration, after the addition of ADP or Pi to the system. This was done to avoid any effects of Pi or ADP consumption on the observed rate. All experiments were conducted in the absence of added ATP. In the first series, ADP was added after Pi. Under these conditions, the addition of ADP was accompanied by a large increase in respiration, associated with a depolarization of Δψ from its highly polarized state back to its control levels with G/M alone, whereas the [NADH] was significantly decreased. When Pi was added after ADP (Fig. 2A and Table I), the combined effects of Pi on the F1F0-ATPase, NADH generation, and redox equivalent flux can be observed. With the addition of Pi, the [NADH] decreased, suggesting that the rate of NADH oxidation initially exceeded the rate of production, even with the predicted activation of the NADH generating capacity by Pi. However, Δψ hyperpolarized while ΔpHm decreased, and surprisingly, ΔG H+ remained essentially constant or increased slightly. The constant ΔG H+ is surprising, because the reducing equivalent flux through NADH had increased more than 10-fold, and ΔG NADH, the driving force for ΔG H+, had been significantly reduced. These latter data suggest that Pi is causing a more efficient transmission of the ΔG NADH to ΔG H+. The dose dependence plots of Pi on NADH, Δψ, and MVO2 in the active state are presented in Fig. 2, B and C. Note that Pi increased Δψ and MVO2 in almost an identical fashion, with K p values of 1.0 mm MVO2 and 0.8 mM Δψ obtained by simply modeling the data by using Equation 2. However, the complex effect on NADH resulted in an initial drop in the [NADH], which remained essentially constant with all subsequent additions. Modeling this as a simple"

Here we investigated the molecular cross-talk between glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and the p105 precursor of the NF-κB p50 subunit. GSK-3β forms an in vivo complex with and specifically phosphorylates NF-κB1/p105 at Ser-903 and Ser-907 in vitro. In addition, the p105 phosphorylation level is reduced in fibroblasts lacking GSK-3β as compared with wild-type cells. GSK-3β has a dual effect on p105: it stabilizes p105 under resting conditions and primes p105 for degradation upon tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α treatment. Indeed, constitutive processing of p105 to p50 occurs at a higher rate in cells lacking GSK-3β with respect to wild-type cells and can be reduced upon reintroduction of GSK-3β by transfection. Moreover, p105 degradation in response to TNF-α is prevented in GSK-3β–/– fibroblasts and by a Ser to Ala point mutation on p105 at positions 903 or 907. Interestingly, the increased sensitiveness to TNF-α-induced death occurring in GSK-3β–/– fibroblasts, which is coupled to a perturbation of p50/105 ratio, can be reproduced by p105 silencing in wild-type fibroblasts."

The apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor-2 (apoER2), another member of the LDL receptor family with functions in cellular signal transmission, also undergoes sequential proteolytic processing, resulting in intracellular domain release into the cytoplasm. The penultimate processing step also involves cleavage of the apoER2 extracellular domain. The rate at which this cleavage step occurs is determined by the glycosylation state of the receptor, which in turn is regulated by the alternative splicing of an exon encoding several O-linked sugar attachment sites.

This so-called O-linked sugar domain serves as an attachment domain for numerous O-linked carbohydrates (reviewed in Ref. 5Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev.

In general, one role of glycosylation is thought to be the stabilization of the receptor proteins. Several mutant cell lines with decreased levels of functional LDL receptors because of defects in glycosylation resulting in increased receptor turnover have been identified (13Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, reduced stability of VLDLR splice variants lacking the O-linked sugar domain has been described (11Magrane J. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Reina M. Gafvels M. Vilaro S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, why apoER2 and VLDLR are differentially spliced in different tissues and which biological functions of the receptors might be regulated by the presence or absence of the O-linked sugar domain.In the case of several other transmembrane proteins, modification of sugar side chains has been shown to regulate specific aspects of their metabolism. Cell surface receptors of the Notch family, for instance, are also single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins that are processed by a series of proteolytical cleavages. Ultimately, this results in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (ICD) into the cytoplasm, followed by translocation into the nucleus where it participates in the regulation of gene transcription (reviewed in Ref. 14Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar). Extension of O-linked fucose monosaccharides by an N-acetylglucosamine transferase is crucial in determining which stimuli will preferentially induce the proteolytical processing of Notch molecules (15Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 16Bruckner K.

Biol. 2000; 10: 813-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Another example for specific proteolytic processing that is regulated by the glycosylation state of the protein is that of the amyloid precursor protein, which is also modified by its carbohydrate side chains (18Galbete J.L. Martin T.R. Peressini E. Modena P. Bianchi R. Forloni G. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Here, we report that the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which is processed in a Notch-like fashion by a series of proteolytical cleavage events that result in the release of its ICD, is differentially glycosylated in a tissue-specific manner. We hypothesized that this differential glycosylation of LRP1 might serve to regulate the rate at which LRP1 is being processed. Using reporter gene assays and immunoblotting for LRP1 cleavage products in the glycosylation deficient ldlD cell line we now show that the glycosylation state of this protein indeed determines the rate of processing. Specifically, the extracellular cleavage step that results in the shedding of the LRP1 ectodomain is enhanced when the protein is hypoglycosylated, which in turn results in increased substrate availability for the final γ-secretase-mediated release of the LRP1 ICD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the apoER2 can also be proteolytically processed in cultured primary neurons as well as in transfected cell lines and that the presence or absence of its alternatively spliced O-linked sugar domain modulates the rate at which the ICD of apoER2 is released.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESd-(+)-Galactose and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine were purchased from Sigma.

Luciferase and β-galactosidase gene expression were analyzed as described previously (20May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using the “Luciferase Assay System” (Promega, Madison, WI) and the “Chemiluminescent β-Galactosidase Detection Kit” (BD Biosciences), respectively. The normalization of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity was done as described. All transfections for reporter gene assays were done in duplicate and repeated in at least two independent experiments.RESULTSThe Glycosylation Pattern of LRP1 and Other Lipoprotein Receptors Is Tissue-dependent—All members of the LDL receptor gene family are type I membrane glycoproteins. LRP1 is cleaved in a late secretory compartment by the processing proteinase furin (29Willnow T.E. Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Moehring T.J. Herz J. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mature, processed LRP1 consists of a membrane-bound 85-kDa subunit and a non-covalently associated extracellular subunit of ∼515 kDa. The apparent molecular weight of LRP1 as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis varies between different tissues. As shown in Fig. 1A, the smaller LRP1 subunit from mouse brain migrates faster than the one present in mouse liver.To determine whether differential glycosylation of LRP1 in brain and liver was responsible for the observed difference in molecular weight, we treated membrane preparations from either tissue with neuraminidase, O-glycosidase, neuraminidase + O-glycosidase, or PNGase F (Fig. 1B). Removal of N-acetylneuraminic acid residues by neuraminidase reduced the difference in apparent molecular weight, and treatment with PNGase F, which removes all N-linked carbohydrate chains, resulted in identical electrophoretical migration of LRP1 from both tissues. Treatment with O-glycosidase, with or without pretreatment with neuraminidase, however, did not change the apparent molecular weight of LRP1 in either preparation. Thus, LRP1 is differentially N-glycosylated in liver and brain. This is mainly because of a higher degree of sialylation in the liver. In contrast to the LDL receptor, which is heavily O-glycosylated (boxed inset, Fig. 1B), there is no apparent O-linked glycosylation of LRP1 in either tissue.Several other members of the LDLR gene family, i.e. the LDL receptor, VLDLR, and apoER2, contain a serine- and threonine-rich domain, which directly precedes the transmembrane segment. This domain serves as an attachment domain for multiple O-linked carbohydrate chains. This so-called O-linked sugar domain is encoded by a separate exon in each of the respective genes and physiologically occurring splice variants that contain or lack the O-linked sugar domain have been found for VLDLR and apoER2. In agreement with these earlier findings we detected the described splice variants of both receptors by RT-PCR, whereas for the LDLR only transcripts that contained the exon encoding the O-linked sugar domain were detected. Intriguingly, there were also tissue differences in the relative abundance of apoER2 mRNA coding for the receptor form that lacks the O-linked sugar domain, which was more abundant in brain compared with placenta (Fig. 1C).The Proteolytic Processing of LRP1 by γ-Secretase Is Increased in Glycosylation Deficient Cells—The functional implications of this tissue-specific glycosylation of LDL receptor family members are largely unclear. It is known, however, that glycosylation affects the stability of some of the receptors. For other transmembrane proteins, which undergo regulated proteolytical processing, i.e. for receptors of the Notch family and for the amyloid precursor protein, regulation of proteolytic cleavage by their glycosylation state has been described. Furthermore, we recently reported that LRP, like amyloid precursor protein and Notch, can also undergo serial proteolytic processing, eventually resulting in the release of its ICD.To investigate whether this processing might be modulated by the glycosylation state of LRP1 we used a CHO-K1 derived mutant cell line, ldlD, which lacks the enzyme galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine 4-epimerase. These cells are unable to synthesize galactose and its derivatives when maintained in galactose-free cell culture medium. Thus, the cells are unable to synthesize N-acetylgalactosamine-based O-linked sugar chains, as well as galactose- or N-acetylgalactosamine-containing complex N-linked oligosaccharides (25Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). ldlD cells were originally identified, because of their relative deficiency in LDL receptors. This protein is highly unstable when it is not O-glycosylated and steady state levels of the LDL receptor are greatly reduced in ldlD cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, LRP1 levels are only slightly reduced, but its electrophoretic mobility is increased because of hypoglycosylation in ldlD cells (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Increased proteolytic processing of hypoglycosylated LRP1. Panels A and B, CHO-K1 (CHO) and ldlD cells, the latter kept in the presence (+)or absence (–) of 10 μmd-(+)-galactose and 100 μm N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, were transfected with 7.5 μg of pCMV4-LDLR (A) or 7.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP1 (B) per 100-mm dish. After 48 h cell membranes were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of LDLR and LRP1, respectively. Panel C, CHO-K1 and ldlD cells were transfected with 1 μg of pLDLR-GV or 1 μg of pLRP-GV, 1.5 μg of pG5E1B-Luc, and 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase per 35-mm dish. After 48 h cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase reporter gene activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by dividing relative light unit values by β-galactosidase activity. Panel D, CHO-K1 and ldlD cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP1 per 100-mm dish. 12 h later cells were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 μm γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 for 24 h. Cell membranes were then prepared and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with a carboxyl-terminal LRP1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the rate of proteolytic processing of hypoglycosylated LRP1, we transfected ldlD and CHO-K1 control cells with a plasmid encoding an LRP-Gal4/VP16 fusion protein. The Gal4/VP16 domain is fused to the LRP1 carboxyl terminus and drives transcription of a Gal4-luciferase reporter gene if released from the membrane by γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of LRP1. Co-transfection of CHO-K1 cells with the LRP-Gal4/VP16 and the Gal4-luciferase reporter plasmids resulted in a robust stimulation of luciferase expression, indicating that LRP1 is proteolytically processed and that its ICD is released in these cells. Under the same conditions severalfold higher reporter gene activity, indicating increased LRP1 processing, is found in ldlD cells. This suggests that LRP1 processing is increased if the protein is hypoglycosylated. With an analogous LDLR-Gal4/VP16 construct, no significant reporter gene expression was noted either in CHO-K1 or ldlD cells. This makes it unlikely that nonspecific protein turnover in ldlD cells could be the reason for the accelerated release of LRP-Gal4/VP16 ICD (Fig. 2C).Hypoglycosylation of LRP1 Facilitates Extracellular Cleavage Resulting in Increased Production of γ-Secretase Substrate Precursor—To confirm that the mechanism of increased LRP1 ICD release in the ldlD line requires γ-secretase activity, we treated LRP-expressing ldlD and CHO-K1 control cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458. This substance inhibits the final proteolytic cleavage step of LRP, which mediates the release of the ICD. Treatment with L-685,458 caused accumulation of a 25-kDa LRP1 fragment that is generated by ectodomain shedding and forms the normal substrate for γ-secretase. Fig. 2D shows a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of the 25-kDa fragment in membrane preparations from ldlD and CHO-K1 cells treated with various concentrations of the inhibitor. In the ldlD cells the 25-kDa fragment accumulated to a greater extent than in the CHO-K1 cells, indicating that the extracellular cleavage step that leads to ectodomain shedding is indeed enhanced in glycoslylation-deficient ldlD cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, the rate of γ-secretase-dependent LRP1 ICD release is greater in the hypoglycosylated state because of increased substrate availability.Proteolytic Release of the ApoER2 ICD—We next sought to determine the role of tissue-specific differential glycosylation for the metabolism of other members of the LDL receptor gene family. We focused on apoER2, because it is expressed in two splice forms in the brain, either containing or not containing the O-linked sugar domain. A first indication for a regulatory role of differential glycosylation for apoER2 processing came from the analysis of neuronal protein extracts from wild type and apoER2 knockout mice. An antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of apoER2 detected not only the full-length receptor but also a considerably smaller protein of ∼25 kDa in lysates of cultured neurons from wild type animals, but not in lysates from apoER2 knockout mice (Fig. 3A), indicating that the smaller band is indeed derived from apoER2. Because the extracellular domain of some splice variants of apoER2 can be cleaved within the secretory pathway (30Koch S. Strasser V. Hauser C. Fasching D. Brandes C. Bajari T.M. Schneider W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2106380487,"During prion diseases, the host protein PrPC is refolded into an abnormal conformer “prion” PrPSc. Histological and pharmacological data have suggested that glycosaminoglycans may be involved in the development of prion diseases. Here we present the first direct evidence that cellular glycosaminoglycans play a role in the biogenesis of PrPSc in prion-infected ScN2a cells. When ScN2a cells were incubated with estradiol β-d-xyloside to inhibit the glycosylation of proteoglycans, PrPSc was vastly reduced. Treating ScN2a-M cells with heparinase III, but not with heparinase I or chondroitinase ABC, caused a profound reduction of PrPSc. In contrast, neither the amount of PrPC nor its subcellular distribution were affected as assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy and flotation procedures. In vitro treatment of ScN2a membranes with heparinase III at either neutral or acidic pH did not reduce the level of protease-resistant PrPSc. The inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, vastly reduces PrPSc in ScN2a cells (Gabizon, R., Meiner, Z., Halimi, M., and Ben-Sasson, S. A. (1993) J. Cell. Physiol. 157, 319–325). Both soluble heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate partially restored the level of PrPSc in chlorate-treated cells. We conclude that heparinase III-sensitive, presumably undersulfated, cellular heparan sulfate plays a significant role in the biogenesis of PrPSc in ScN2a cells.

The resulting pathological conformer, PrPSc, is in turn the only known component of the infectious prion. Little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the transformation of PrPC into PrPSc. The PrP isoforms possess disparate biochemical properties. In contrast to PrPC, most PrPSc possesses a protease-resistant core (PrP27–30) and is insoluble in detergents (8Tzaban S. Friedlander G. Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Yedidia Y. Shaked G. Gabizon R.

Although these putative prion cofactors have not yet been identified, several candidates have been put forward including the laminin receptors (14Rieger R. Edenhofer F. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. Nat.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3307-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Diverse indirect lines of evidences have linked proteoglycans (PGs) and their GAG chains and especially heparan sulfate (HS) to the metabolism of the PrP isoforms (reviewed in Ref. 19Diaz-Nido J. Wandosell F. Avila J. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). First, HS accumulates in cerebral prion amyloid plaques (20Snow A.D. Kisilevsky R. Willmer J. Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Acta Neuropathol. 1989; 77: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and it also associates with the more diffuse PrPSc deposits that appear in early stages of prion diseases (21McBride P.A. Wilson M.I. Eikelenboom P. Tunstall A. Bruce M.E. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, a variety of sulfated glycans, such as low molecular weight heparin (22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suramin (23Ladogana A. Casaccia P. Ingrosso L. Cibati M. Salvatore M. Xi Y.G. Masullo C. Pocchiari M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), pentosan polysulfate, and dextran sulfate (23Ladogana A. Casaccia P. Ingrosso L. Cibati M. Salvatore M. Xi Y.G. Masullo C.

Virol. 1993; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dextran-based HS analogs reduce the formation of PrPSc in infected cells and in some cases prolong the incubation time of experimental prion diseases. Because PrP binds heparin (22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Caughey B. Brown K. Raymond G.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18421-18430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that sulfated glycans exert their anti-prion effects by competing with the binding of PrPC to putative cellular pro-prion GAGs (22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, the cell-free conversion of PrPC to a protease-resistant form, PrP-res (which is biochemically analogous to PrPSc), is stimulated rather than inhibited by soluble HS analogs (28Wong C. Xiong L.W. Horiuchi M. Raymond L. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Third, long term incubation of cells with chlorate, which affects the sulfation of GAGs as well as of proteins and glycolipids, reduces PrPSc (22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fourth, a heparinase-sensitive brain fraction promotes the reconstitution of infectivity of dimethyl sulfoxide-solubilized PrPSc (29Shaked G.M. Meiner Z. Avraham I. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14324-14328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, several sulfated glycans increase the endocytosis of PrP, suggesting that PGs may also modulate the subcellular trafficking of PrP (30Shyng S.L. Lehmann S. Moulder K.L. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30221-30229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schatzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). During the biogenesis of PGs, the synthesis of GAG chains is initiated by the linking of a d-xylose to serine residues within the protein core. The chains are then elongated and modified to yield the highly complex GAGs. Several β-d-xylosides (d-xylopyranose attached to an aglycone) (32Schwartz N.B. Galligani L. Ho P.L. Dorfman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4047-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Fritz T.A. Lugemwa F.N. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 300-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can inhibit the initiation reaction by serving as soluble primers for GAG biosynthesis. These xylosides thus interfere with the proper glycosylation of PGs, but they also promote the synthesis of soluble xylosides-primed GAG analogs that are secreted into the medium. The aglycone structure of the xyloside can determine the type of soluble GAG that is produced (as well as the extent to which PG glycosylation is inhibited). Thus, the lipophilic xyloside estradiol β-d-xyloside (EDX) primes both HS and chondroitin sulfate (CS), and the type of GAG that is primed depends on the concentration of the xyloside (34Lugemwa F.N. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6674-6677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we studied the involvement of proteoglycans in the metabolism of PrP in mouse neuroblastoma cells chronically infected with prions (ScN2a-M). At first, we used EDX (34Lugemwa F.N. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6674-6677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to interfere with the biosynthesis of PGs. In cells treated for 4 days with EDX, there was a strong reduction of PrPSc, whereas in uninfected cells PrPC was unchanged. This result strengthened the contention that cellular GAGs are involved in the metabolism of PrPSc. To start characterizing these GAGs, we used GAG-degrading enzymes of bacterial origin. ScN2a-M cells treated for 4 days with heparinase III showed a dramatic decrease in PrPSc, whereas chondroitinase ABC and heparinase I had no effect. None of these enzymes affected the amount, the subcellular distribution, or the association of the precursor PrPC to membrane rafts as demonstrated by immunofluorescent microscopy and by flotation assays. Incubation of purified ScN2a-M membranes with heparinase III did not reduce the protease-resistance of PrPSc, suggesting that heparinase III does not directly perturb the properties of this protein. The decrease in PrPSc caused by treatment of cells with chlorate (22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was partially restored by both the addition of soluble HS and CS. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that one or more heparinase III-sensitive cellular HS regulate the metabolism of PrPSc in ScN2a cells.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in DMEM-16 (1 g of glucose/liter) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Treatments with EDX and with GAG-degrading enzymes were performed on cells grown in 6-well dishes in DMEM-16/Opti-MEM (1:1) supplemented with 5% FCS. Cultures of bovine corneal endothelial cells were established from steer eyes as described previously (38Vlodavsky I. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Hartford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M.

This antibody was used at a dilution of 1:5000 for Western blot or at the dilution of 1:1000 for immunofluorescence experiments. Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). PrP Isoforms and PrP Analysis—The PrP isoforms were characterized and separated as described previously (9Meyer R.K.

PrPSc was defined as the PrP fraction resistant to proteolysis catalyzed by proteinase K (20 μg/ml, 37 °C, 30 min). The protease activity had been stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2 mm. SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting of the PrP isoforms were all carried out as described previously (41Naslavsky N. Shmeeda H. Friedlander G. Yanai A. Futerman A.H. Barenholz Y. Taraboulos A. J.

Cells were lysed in ice-cold “standard” lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 (TX-100), 0.23% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA), and the lysates were immediately centrifuged for 40 s at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. All of the biochemical analyses were performed on this postnuclear fraction. Protein concentrations in cell lysates were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and in each experiment the samples were normalized for their protein content prior to loading on SDS-PAGE gels. Densitometric analysis was performed using the TINA software (Raytest Isotopenmellgerilte GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany). Digestion of Membranes with Heparinase III—In vitro digestion was performed on total cell membranes prepared as follows: ∼3 × 107 cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and sonicated in a bath sonicator (3 × 15 s). The suspension was then spun in a microcentrifuge to remove debris (10,000 rpm, 3 min), and membranes were pelleted out of the supernatant by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion (300 μlof 15% sucrose) in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge at 55,000 rpm (g av = 200,000 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C in a TLS-55 rotor. Membranes were incubated with 0.1 units/ml heparinase III for 2 h at 37 °C in either HEPES buffer containing 0.1% TX-100 or MES buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 5.7) containing 0.1% TX-100. Heparinase activity was stopped by the addition of proteinase K (20 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C). ECM-degrading Assay—GAG-degrading activity was assayed by the release of radiolabeled products from 35S-labeled ECM plates produced by cultured corneal endothelial cells and prepared as described previously (38Vlodavsky I.

The radiolabeled material released from these ECM plates was then fractionated by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B columns as described previously (43Vlodavsky I. Fuks Z. Bar-Ner M. Ariav Y. Schirrmacher V. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 2704-2711PubMed Google Scholar). Flotation of PrP—Detergent-insoluble complexes were analyzed on flotation gradients (44Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Confluent ScN2a-M cells growing in two 90-mm plates (∼3 × 107 cells) were incubated with 450 μl of TNE (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1% TX-100 for 30 min. Lysates were then adjusted to 35% Nycodenz with ice-cold 70% Nycodenz prepared in TNE and loaded at the bottom of TLS-55 Beckman ultracentrifuge tubes. A 8–35% Nycodenz linear step gradient in TNE was overlaid above the lysate (200 μl each of 25, 22.5, 20, 18, 15, 12, and 8% Nycodenz). Tubes were spun at 55,000 rpm (g av = 200,000 × g) for 4 h at 4 °C in a TLS-55 rotor. Thirteen fractions of 180 μl each were collected from the top of the tube. Immunofluorescence of PrPc—PrPC clustering and visualization on the surface of cells was performed as described previously (45Yanai A. Meiner Z. Gahali I. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PrPC molecules were labeled with the mAb 3F4 on the cell surface of living and then clustered by adding a polyclonal second antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. The cells were then fixed with 10% formalin prior to examination with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Binding of 125I-labeled bFGF—Confluent N2a-M cultures growing in 24-well plates were treated with heparinases (0.1 unit/ml, 37 °C, 4 h). They were then rinsed twice with ice-cold binding medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 2 h on ice in binding medium containing 5 ng/ml 125I-labeled bFGF. The cells were further rinsed three times with cold binding medium and lysed with 300 μl of 0.1 n NaOH (1 h, room temperature). Both the cell lysates and supernatants (the combined three rinses) were counted in a γ-counter to determine the “bound” and “unbound” values, respectively. The Lipophilic Xyloside EDX Reduces PrPSc in Prion-infected Cells—The general inhibitor of sulfation, chlorate, reduces PrPSc in scrapie-infected cells. To see whether this is attributable to its effect on sulfated GAGs, we used the membrane-permeant xyloside EDX, which specifically inhibits PG glycosylation (34Lugemwa F.N. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6674-6677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prion-infected murine neuroblastoma ScN2a-M cells (Fig. 1A) and uninfected N2a-M cells (Fig. 1B) were treated with EDX (10–50 μm) for 4 days in DMEM/Opti-MEM medium supplemented with 5% FCS (PrPSc is very stable in cells, so that several days are required to eliminate preexisting PrPSc). There were no detectable cytopathic or cytostatic effects. To specifically detect the protease-resistant PrPSc, half of each ScN2a-M lysate was digested with proteinase K (20 μg/ml, 30 min, 37 °C) prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 1A, +PK). The three protease-resistant PrP bands are the glycoforms that are characteristic of mouse PrPSc. The other half of the ScN2a-M lysates were analyzed without proteolysis (Fig. 1A, –PK) for “total PrP.” The Western blots were developed with the mAb 3F4. EDX caused a profound, dose-dependent decrease in protease-resistant PrP27–30. However, the amount of the cellular isoform, PrPC, was unaltered in uninfected N2a-M cells treated with EDX (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, EDX also reduced the high molecular mass PrP species (33–35 kDa) in the ScN2a samples not treated with proteinase K (Fig. 1A, –PK). In ScN2a cells, the high molecular mass PrP bands include both PrPC and full-length PrPSc molecules. Two high molecular mass PrPSc populations have been described in ScN2a cells. First, there is a minority of protease-resistant PrPSc molecules that have not yet been trimmed by cellular proteases. Upon digestion with PK, these species are converted to PrP27–30 (12Taraboulos A. Raeber A.J. Borchelt D.R. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Second, 31–35-kDa PrP also comprises protease-sensitive PrPSc species, which are fully digested by the stringent proteinase K treatment performed here (8Tzaban S. Friedlander G. Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Yedidia Y. Shaked G. Gabizon R. Taraboulos A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12868-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 46Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The decrease in PrPSc in EDX-treated cells was not due to the aglycone moiety (estradiol), since β-estradiol at sub-toxic concentrations did not reduce PrPSc in ScN2a-M cells (not shown). These results support the contention that cellular proteoglycans are involved, directly or indirectly, in the metabolism of PrPSc (22Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Halimi M. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Wong C. Xiong L.W. Horiuchi M. Raymond L. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Heparinase III, but Not Heparinase I nor Chondroitinase ABC, Reduces PrPSc in Cells—At the concentration used above, EDX affects both HS and CS chains of proteoglycans (34Lugemwa F.N. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6674-6677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further determine which type of GAG is involved in the biogenesis of prions, we used bacterial heparinases I and III as well as chondroitinase ABC to digest specific cellular GAGs. None of the enzymatic treatments described below caused detectable cytopathic or cytostatic effects. We first used chondroitinase ABC to digest CS and dermatan sulfate in ScN2a-M cells (Fig. 2A). Cells were incubated for 4 days with 0–0.5 units/ml chondroitinase ABC. They were then lysed, and their total protein concentration was normalized before analyzing total PrP (Fig. 2A , panel 1, –PK) or protease-resistant PrPSc (Fig. 2A , panel 1, +PK) by Western blotting. This treatment had no effect on either total PrP or on protease-resistant PrPSc, suggesting that neither CS nor dermatan sulfate plays critical roles in the biogenesis of PrPSc in ScN2a-M cells. To confirm that these enzymes were active throughout the experiment, we measured their residual activity in the cell medium at the end of the experiment by ECM-degrading assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2B , graph). The chondroitinase was still active after 4-day incubation as confirmed by the production of low molecular weight sulfate-labeled GAG degradation fragments (fractions 25–35). To see whether HS chains might be involved in the metabolism of PrPSc, cells were treated with heparinase I or heparinase III. Neither enzyme altered the level of PrPC in uninfected N2a-M cells (Fig. 2A , panels 2 and 3). In contrast, heparinase III almost completely eliminated protease-resistant PrPSc from ScN2a-M cells (Fig. 2B , panel 2, +PK), whereas no change was observed with heparinase I. That both enzymes were still active at the end of the incubation was again confirmed by using an ECM-degrading assay (Fig. 2B) as explained above for the chondroitinase. Because the two heparinase yielded such contrasting results, we decided to compare the amount of cellular HS that they released from N2a cells. N2a-M cells were radiolabeled for 2 days with Na235 SO4 (40 μCi/ml). After thorough rinses, the cells were treated for 3 h with either one of the two heparinases (0.1 unit/ml) in DMEM/Opti-MEM containing 5% FCS (in a CO2 incubator). The incubation medium was then cleared from cells and debris by centrifugation (5 min, 450 × g) and subjected to gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B columns (Fig. 2C , upper panel). Both heparinases released radiolabeled, low molecular weight degradation fragments from the cells, indicating that they both digested similar amount of cellular HS chains. This conclusion was confirmed independently by a bFGF-binding assay. HS is a low affinity receptor for this growth factor (47Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

In type-2 diabetes, the kinetics of insulin secretion become grossly distorted, and, to therapeutically correct this, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate priming and secretion of insulin secretory granules. Munc13-1, a synaptic protein that regulates SNARE complex assembly, is the major protein determining the priming of synaptic vesicles. Here, we demonstrate the presence of Munc13-1 in human, rat, and mouse pancreatic islet beta cells. Expression of Munc13-1, along with its cognate partners, syntaxin 1a and Munc18a, is reduced in the pancreatic islets of type-2 diabetes non-obese Goto-Kakizaki and obese Zucker fa/fa rats. In insulinoma cells, overexpressed Munc13-1-enhanced green fluorescent protein is translocated to the plasma membrane in a temperature-dependent manner. This, in turn, greatly amplifies insulin exocytosis as determined by patch clamp capacitance measurements and radioimmunoassay of the insulin released. The potentiation of exocytosis by Munc13-1 is dependent on endogenously produced diacylglycerol acting on the overexpressed Munc13-1 because it is blocked by a phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122) and abrogated when the diacylglycerol binding-deficient Munc13-1H567K mutant is expressed instead of the wild type protein. Our data demonstrate that Munc13-mediated vesicle priming is not restricted to neurotransmitter release but is also functional in insulin secretion, where it is subject to regulation by the diacylglycerol second messenger pathway.

They contain a large population of morphologically docked granules, some of which are primed for release, and therefore designated release-ready (7Steyer J.A. Horstmann H. Almers W.

In contrast, the number of docked vesicles in pancreatic islet beta cells is much smaller, and again only a subpopulation of docked granules is readily releasable (9Eliasson L. Renstrom E. Ding W.G.

This discrepancy in the number of docked vesicles partially explains the much slower kinetics of secretion from beta cells, which in addition is dependent upon a number of as yet unknown vesicle mobilization and priming steps (9Eliasson L.

To be able to therapeutically correct these abnormal insulin secretory responses in diabetes, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate mobilization, priming, and secretion of insulin secretory granules. SNARE protein function in mammals is regulated by Munc13s, which constitute a family of three largely brain-specific homologues of Caenorhabditis elegans Unc-13 (15Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Drosophila Dunc-13 (16Aravamudan B. Fergestad T. Davis W.S. Rodesch C.K. Broadie K. Nat.

Genetic studies in mice, C. elegans, and Drosophila showed that Munc13s/Unc-13/Dunc-13 are essential secretory vesicle priming proteins. Lack of Munc13s/Unc-13/Dunc-13 in deletion mutant neurons leads to a complete loss of fusion-competent synaptic vesicles (16Aravamudan B. Fergestad T. Davis W.S. Rodesch C.K. Broadie K. Nat.

Overexpression of Munc13-1 in chromaffin cells, on the other hand, causes a dramatic increase in secretory vesicle priming (22Ashery U. Varoqueaux F. Voets T. Betz A. Koch H. Neher E. Rettig J. Brose N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3586-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).

In the present study, we show that at least Munc13-1 is expressed in human and rat pancreatic islet beta cells, and that Munc13-1 expression levels are reduced in rat models of type-2 diabetes. We demonstrate that overexpression of Munc13-1 in insulinoma HIT-15 and INS-1 cells causes a potentiation of glucose-, phorbol ester-, and membrane depolarization-evoked insulin secretion. Our data demonstrate that Munc13 proteins are functionally relevant potent priming proteins for regulated secretion from non-neural/non-neuroendocrine cells.

Briefly, cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 g/liter (11 mm) glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Cansera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada). Cells were plated out at a density of 1.8 × 105/well in 24-well plates. Once they reached ∼60–80% confluence (20–24 h of incubation), cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/well using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Transfection efficiency, determined by quantifying EGFP-positive cells, was consistently of 30–40%. Two days after transfection, cells were washed and incubated in 0.5 ml of low K+ Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (in mm: 4.8 KCl, 129 NaCl, 5 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0–0.5 mm glucose for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was then collected from each well, and its insulin content was considered to reflect the basal insulin release. The medium was replaced with different stimulatory media (15 mm glucose or 100 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) with 4.8 mm KCl) for another 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the media for basal and stimulated release of each well were collected and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min to remove detached cells. The resulting upper halves of the respective supernatants were collected, and their insulin content was determined by radioimmunoassay according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence microscopy of rat and human islets, 10–20 islets were plated on glass coverslips coated with rat tail collagen (Vitrogen 100, Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA). The islets were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 0.5 h at room temperature, blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin for 0.5 h at room temperature, and then immunolabeled with mouse monoclonal anti-Munc13-1 (1:25 dilution) and guinea pig anti-insulin (1:200 dilution) overnight at 4°C. After rinsing with 0.1% saponin and phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with the fluorescent-labeled appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, mounted on slides in a fading retarder (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in glycerol), and examined using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM 410, Zeiss, Germany) (33Huang X. Kang Y.-H. Pasyk E.A. Sheu L. Salapatek A. Gaisano H.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C740-C750Crossref Google Scholar, 34Kang Y.H. Huang X.H. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz G. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For fluorescence imaging of overexpressed Munc13-1-EGFP or Munc13-1H567K-EGFP, HIT-T15 cells were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips and transfected as described above. The coverslips were mounted on a chamber connected to a temperature control unit (Olympus America, Melville, NY). The chamber contained 1.5 ml of solution to bathe the cells, and agents added to the chamber were limited to a volume of 10 μl to avoid perturbation of the temperature of the bathing solution. Confocal images were taken at the indicated intervals to visualize the localization of Munc13-1-EGFP (or Munc13-1H567K-EGFP) without changing the imaging parameters (gain intensity, confocal plane). The laser intensity was reduced to minimize photobleaching. To quantify the Munc13-1-EGFP and Munc13-1H567K-EGFP signals at the plasma membrane, we drew a region of interest encompassing only the plasma membrane of each cell (NIH Image version 1.61), and analyzed the fluorescent pixel intensity. Patch Clamp Capacitance Measurements—INS-1 cells were studied under standard whole-cell patch clamp conditions as described previously (33Huang X. Kang Y.-H. Pasyk E.A. Sheu L. Salapatek A. Gaisano H.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C740-C750Crossref Google Scholar, 34Kang Y.H. Huang X.H. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz G. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). INS-1 cells transfected with Munc13-1-EGFP were identified by the green fluorescence. All intracellular solutions contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, and 3 MgATP, pH 7.3, with KOH. Extracellular solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.5 glucose, pH 7.3, with NaOH. TPA was dissolved in Me2SO as a 1000-fold stock solution and added directly to the bath solution to get the indicated final concentrations. Experiments were performed at room temperature or at 30–32 °C. Capacitance measurements (C m) were performed according to published procedures (33Huang X. Kang Y.-H. Pasyk E.A. Sheu L. Salapatek A. Gaisano H.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C740-C750Crossref Google Scholar, 34Kang Y.H. Huang X.H. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz G. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were held at –70 mV and depolarized to 0 mV for 250 ms in the absence and then presence of the indicated reagents (TPA, U73122 (10 μm, 5 min)). Immediately following depolarization, cells were exposed to a sine wave centered at –70 mV, and the changes in C m stimulated by this depolarizing voltage pulse were measured. A 3–5-min rest interval between depolarization pulse protocols was left to ensure refilling of the releasable pools. These experiments were performed using a quick-response lock-in patch clamp amplifier and a patch clamp Pulse™ software (HEKA Institute, Lambrecht, Germany). To minimize the influence of transfection variability or cell line passage number on cell membrane capacitance, data from 3–4 cells were averaged for each experiment and considered as n = 1, each group had the same chance of coming from the same passage, and the cell passage was kept within a narrow change for each set of experiments (passages 60–65). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were compared by unpaired Student's t test for single comparisons and by analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Munc13-1 Is Present in Human and Rat Pancreatic Islet and Insulinoma Beta Cells—We determined the expression levels of Munc13-1 in human, mouse and Wistar rat islets and in the insulinoma cell lines HIT (from hamster) and INS-1 (from mouse) by Western blotting using a rabbit antibody against the N-terminal amino acids 1–305 of Munc13-1 (26Rhee J.-R. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Like rat brain, human, mouse, and rat islets, as well as insulinoma cell lines HIT-T15 and INS-1, contain Munc13-1 (Fig. 1A). Islets contain not only insulin-secreting beta cells but also glucagon-secreting alpha and somatostatin-secreting delta cells. To determine which cell type expresses Munc13-1, we performed laser confocal microscopy on rat and human islets after double labeling for insulin and Munc13-1 (Fig. 1B). In these experiments, Munc13-1 was detected using a commercially available antibody that preferentially interacts with Munc13-1 (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany; Ref. 25Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We found that, in both rat and human islets, Munc13-1 immunofluorescence was strongest in insulin-positive beta cells (indicated by arrows) but also detectable in other cell types, indicating that Munc13-1 is most abundant in beta cells. In all positive cells, Munc13-1 immunofluorescence was detectable in the cytosol and on the plasma membrane. Munc13-1 Levels in Islets Are Reduced in Type-2 Diabetes Rat Islets—Patients with type-2 diabetes exhibit abnormalities in glycemic control and lipid metabolism (35Cerasi E. Luft R. Acta Endocrinol. 1967; 55: 278-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These aspects of the disease have been well studied in obese and non-obese diabetic rodent models, such as the non-obese GK rats (14Abdel-Halim S.M. Guenifi A. Khan A. Larsson O. Berggren P.O. Ostenson C.G. Efendic E. Diabetes. 1996; 556: 934-940Crossref Google Scholar, 36Ostenson C.-G. Kahn A. Abdel-Halim S.M. Guenifi A. Suzuki K. Goto Y. Efendic S.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4218-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In Zucker diabetic fatty rats, the islets accumulate excessive fat (38Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.-T. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3547-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and exhibit a defective response to fatty acid stimulation (39Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Inman L.R. Nagasawa Y. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5633-5637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lowering of the islet fat by troglitazone treatment restores islet secretory function (38Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.-T. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3547-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Long-chain acyl-CoA, the intracellular form of free fatty acids, as well as other fatty acids, including palmitate and myristate, acutely stimulate insulin secretion even in the absence of ATP or extracellular Ca2+ (40Komatsu M. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Deeney J.T. Gromada J. Hoy M. Olsen H.L. Rhodes C.J. Prentki M. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9363-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It was suggested that free fatty acids act directly on the exocytotic machinery (41Deeney J.T. Gromada J. Hoy M. Olsen H.L. Rhodes C.J. Prentki M. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9363-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), for example by increasing the size of the docked pool of insulin granules that regulate the first phase of insulin secretion in a SNARE-dependent manner (42Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, DAG levels within the islet beta cells are altered by changes in the cellular free fatty acid metabolism (38Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.-T. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3547-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 39Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Inman L.R. Nagasawa Y. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol.

We therefore examined whether Munc13-1, a cellular DAG receptor, might be the an indirect target of free fatty acids in the regulation of insulin secretion and whether Munc13-1 levels are altered in models of type-2 diabetes. We reported that the expression of the SNARE proteins syntaxin-1A, VAMP-2, and SNAP-25 is down-regulated in the islets of fa/fa Zucker (30Chan C.B. MacPhail R.M. Sheu L. Wheeler M.B. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and, more recently, also in the islets of GK rats (37Gaisano H.Y. Ostenson C.-G. Sheu L. Wheeler W.B. Efendic S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4218-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because syntaxin 1A is a substrate of Munc13-1 and down-regulated in Munc13-1-deficient neurons (19Augustin I. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Nature. 1999; 400: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), we tested whether Munc13-1 expression is also dysregulated in type-2 diabetes. For this purpose, we examined the levels of Munc13-1, nSec1/Munc18–1, and syntaxin-1A in the islets of two diabetic models, the obese fa/fa Zucker rats and the non-obese GK rats. As controls for these diabetic rats, we used the respective lean Zucker and Wistar rats. The male GK rats (2–3 months, 300–350 g) used here were from a larger batch of rats of the Stockholm colony that we had also used in a recent reported study (37Gaisano H.Y. Ostenson C.-G. Sheu L. Wheeler W.B. Efendic S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4218-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), along with age-matched Wistar rats (300–350 g). The 9 a.m. serum glucose for this batch of GK rats was 19.7 ± 2.0, whereas the Wistar rats was 7.0 ± 1.1 mm. The male Zucker fa/fa (13–15 weeks old, 650 g) and the age-matched lean Zucker controls (370 g) were from the same commercial source (Charles River Laboratories) as we had previously reported (30Chan C.B. MacPhail R.M. Sheu L. Wheeler M.B. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Zucker rats were sacrificed shortly after arrival to extract the islets. Normal rat chow was fed to all of these rats prior to sacrifice. We found that Munc13-1 as well as nSec1/Munc18–1 and syntaxin-1A were present in the control and the corresponding type-2 diabetes rat models. However, the expression levels of all three proteins were reduced in the diabetic rats as compared with their normal controls (Fig. 2). Munc13-1 Translocates to the Plasma Membrane of Insulinoma Cells in a Temperature-dependent and DAG-dependent Manner—We showed previously that, in chromaffin cells and fibroblasts, phorbol esters induce a PKC-independent translocation of heterologously expressed Munc13-1-EGFP fusion proteins to the plasma membrane (22Ashery U. Varoqueaux F. Voets T. Betz A. Koch H."
https://openalex.org/W2060033205,"Arabidopsis thaliana calcineurin B-like protein (AtCBL2) is a member of a recently identified family of calcineurin B-like calcium-binding proteins in A. thaliana. The crystal structure of AtCBL2 has been determined at 2.1 Å resolution. The protein forms a compact α-helical structure with two pairs of EF-hand motifs. The structure is similar in overall folding topology to the structures of calcineurin B and neuronal calcium sensor 1, but differs significantly in local conformation. The two calcium ions are coordinated in the first and fourth EF-hand motifs, whereas the second and third EF-hand motifs are maintained in the open form by internal hydrogen bonding without coordination of calcium ions. Both a possible site and a possible mechanism for the target binding to AtCBL2 are discussed based on the three-dimensional structure.

Both a possible site and a possible mechanism for the target binding to AtCBL2 are discussed based on the three-dimensional structure. Calcium signaling mechanisms are widely employed by all eukaryotic organisms to regulate gene expression and a variety of cellular processes. In plants, many extracellular signals, such as light, drought, cold, salinity, and stress factors, elicit changes in cellular calcium concentration (1Bush D.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 95-122Crossref Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 2Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Curr. Opi. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The calcium sensor protein often changes its conformation in a calcium-dependent manner and interacts with other signaling proteins to relay the signal. Several families of calcium sensor proteins have been identified in higher plants. One of the most fully characterized sensor proteins is calmodulin, which has four EF-hand motifs for calcium binding (3Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Recently, novel calcium sensor proteins with EF-hand motifs from Arabidopsis thaliana have been identified (4Liu J. Zhu J.-K. Science. 1998; 280: 1943-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 5Kudla J. Xu Q. Harter K. Gruissem W. Luan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4718-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), referred to as AtCBL 1The abbreviations used are: AtCBL, Arabidopsis thaliana calcineurin B-like protein; CIPK, CBL-interacting protein kinase; ScaBP, SOS3-like calcium-binding protein; SOS3, salt overlay sensitive 3; NCS-1, neuronal calcium sensor 1; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CNA, calcineurin A. (A. thaliana calcineurin B-like protein). AtCBL is also referred to as SCaBP (SOS3-like calcium-binding proteins), where SOS3 (salt overlay sensitive 3) is the first sensor protein identified in this family. These proteins show substantial sequence similarity with the regulatory B subunit of calcineurin (CNB) and neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1) from animals (Fig. 1). AtCBLs are encoded by a multigene family of at least 10 members in Arabidopsis and are predicted to have three EF-hand motifs for calcium binding with lower affinity than calmodulin (6Ishitani M. Liu J. Halfter U. Kim C.S. Wei M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other members of the AtCBL family, such as AtCBL 1, 4, and 8, contain a putative N-terminal myristoylation motif. In fact, AtCBL4 (SOS3) requires N-myristoylation for plant salt tolerance (6Ishitani M. Liu J. Halfter U. Kim C.S. Wei M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A family of sucrose nonfermenting-like protein kinases has been identified as targets for CBL proteins (7Shi J. Kim K.N. Ritz O. Albrecht B. Gupta R. Harter K. Luan S. Kudla J. Plant Cell. 1999; 6: 2393-2405Google Scholar, 8Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 9Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These are serine-threonine protein kinases, referred to as AtCIPK (A. thaliana CBL-interacting protein kinase), that form a novel family of proteins found so far only in plants. AtCIPK is equivalent to PKS (SOS2-like protein kinase), where SOS2 is identified as a SOS3 target protein. CIPK consists of regulatory and catalytic domains that interact with each other to keep the kinase inactive, presumably by preventing substrate access to the catalytic site (10Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Binding of CBL to the regulatory domain leads to the opening of the catalytic domain's active region and appears to disrupt the intramolecular domain interaction of CIPK. Biochemical data show that a 21- or 24-amino acid region in the regulatory domain is necessary and sufficient for CBL binding. This region contains several conserved residues and is referred to as the FISL motif (10Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) or NAF domain (11Albrecht V. Ritz O. Linder S. Harter K. Kudla J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis genome contains ∼25 CIPK protein genes (12Luan S. Kudla J. Concepcion M.R. Yalovsky S. Gruissem W. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Considering the number of genes in the CBL and CIPK families, one would expect that more than one CBL would interact with more than one CIPK. In addition, CBL/CIPK systems are widely distributed among higher plants, because proteins homologous to CBL and CIPK are identified in other higher plants. The novel CBL/CIPK system functions in a large array of plant signal transduction in response to stress stimuli. For example, the expression of AtCBL1 is induced remarkably by drought, cold, and wounding stresses, suggesting that the calcium sensor protein is responsive to the respective signaling cascades. AtCBL4 (SOS3) binding activates AtCIPK24 (SOS2) in a calcium-dependent manner, and AtCBL4/AtCIPK24 (SOS3/SOS2) is involved in sodium and potassium ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (4Liu J. Zhu J.-K. Science. 1998; 280: 1943-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 13Xiong L. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 14Zhu J.-K. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (4511) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports show that AtCBL1/AtCIPK15 (ScaBP5/PKS3) are parts of a calcium-responsive negative regulatory loop that controls sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) (15Guo Y. Xiong L. Song C-P. Gong D. Halfter U. Zhu J.-K. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and that AtCIPK3 regulates ABA response during seed germination (16Kim K.-N. Cheong Y.H. Grant J.J. Pandey G.K. Luan S. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). AtCBL2 is a CBL that has no myristoylation motif in the N terminus, and its expression profile suggests a role in light-signal transduction (17Nozawa A. Koizumi N. Sano H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 976-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). AtCBL2 interacts prominently with AtSR1, which is identical to AtCIPK14 in the CIPK family. AtSR1 accumulates in response to light (18Chikano H. Ogawa M. Ikeda Y. Koizumi N Kusano T. Sano H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), evidence that AtCBL2 and AtSR1 are located downstream of the light signal. Despite the great importance of intracellular signaling pathways in plants, no structural information has been obtained for the CBL/CIPK system. Here, we report the crystal structure analysis of calcium-bound AtCBL2 and show that the structure of AtCBL2 is similar in overall folding topology to the structures of CNB and related proteins but differs in the local conformation involved in the target recognition mechanism. Expression, Purification, CD Spectroscopy, and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectra—Details on the expression, purification, and crystallization of AtCBL2 have been reported previously (30Nagae M. Nozawa A. Koizumi N. Sano H. Hashimito H. Sato M. Shimizu T. Acta Crystallogr. 2003; D59: 1079-1080Google Scholar). In brief, the AtCBL2 encoding A. thaliana 1-226 was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase. It was then purified by three column chromatography steps using glutathione Sepharose, HiTrap Q, and Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences). The CD spectra of calcium-bound AtCBL2 were measured on a JASCO J-720W spectrometer using a 0.1-mm quartz cuvette in a stock solution (5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm CaCl2). Successively, the CD spectra were also recorded after the addition of 1.25 mm EGTA. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired on a Micromass Q-T of 2 mass spectrometer. A solution of 50 μm calcium-bound AtCBL2 in the stock solution was applied on a hand-filled short size-exclusion chromatography column packed with Amersham Sephadex G-25, and rapid in-line desalting was achieved prior to electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy analyses (49Benson L.M. Kumar R. Cavanagh J. Naolor S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After the equilibration of the size-exclusion chromatography short column with 10 mm ammonium acetate, 5 μl of the sample solution was injected. The mobile phase was introduced at 5 μl/min, and electrospray mass spectra were obtained. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of AtCBL2 were obtained using polyethylene glycol 8000 as a precipitant. The crystals belong to space group C2221 with unit-cell parameters of a = 83.9 Å, b = 118.1 Å, and c = 49.1 Å. A summary of data collection statistics is given in Table I. All the sets of diffraction intensity data for structural analysis (data-sets of Native-2, trimethyllead acetate, LuCl3, and K2Pt(NO2)4 in Table I) were collected at 100 K using Cu-Kα radiation with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ Imaging Plate diffractometer equipped with Osmic confocal mirror optics, the whole being mounted on a Rigaku FR-D ultra-high brilliant rotating-anode x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 60 mA. High-resolution native data (data set of Native-1 in Table I) were collected at 100 K using a Jupiter 210 (Rigaku MSC) on the BL45XU beam line at SPring-8, Harima, Japan.

This was attributed mainly to a rather low sequence homology with either of these models, as well as to structural differences.

The Ramachandran plot of the final model, containing 189 amino acid residues from Asp-32 to His-220 plus two calcium ions and 138 water molecules, shows that all of the amino acid residues are in the most favored and allowed region defined by the program PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A.

Accessible surface areas were calculated using the Protein-Protein Interaction server (39Jones S. Thornton J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 31-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).

Coordinates for AtCBL2 are being deposited in the Protein Data Bank of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (Protein Data Bank code 1UHN). Overall Structure—The polypeptide chain of AtCBL2 is folded into two globular domains (N-terminal and C-terminal domains) composed of an α-helical structure with nine α-helices (αA-αI), two 310-helices (αJ and αK) and four short β-strands. These two domains are connected by a short linker (Figs. 1 and 2a) and superimposed with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.0 Å for Cα atoms corresponding to four α-helices (αB-αE, αF-αI). The structure of AtCBL2 is similar in overall folding topology to the structures of the related proteins, CNB and NCS-1 (respective 23 and 22% sequence identities with AtCBL2), neurocalcin and recoverin (Fig. 1). However, AtCBL2 contains an additional helix (αA) in the N terminus and a long C-terminal region including αJ and αK, compared with the structure of CNB. In addition, significant differences are observed in local conformation at the domain-domain interface between AtCBL2 and these related proteins. In fact, the superposition of AtCBL2 on CNB for Cα atoms corresponding to eight α-helices yields the large r.m.s.d. of 2.3 Å, whereas the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are both well superimposed, with r.m.s.d of 1.1 and 1.6 Å, respectively. This indicates that the different domain-domain hinge motions occur between AtCBL2 and the related proteins. In fact, when the N-terminal domains of AtCBL2 and CNB are superimposed ∼30° swiveling of the C-terminal domain is observed (Fig. 2b). Likewise, ∼15° rotations are observed between AtCBL2 and NCS-1 (19Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and between AtCBL2 and neurocalcin (20Kumar S.V. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Loop structures connecting α-helices at the opposite side of the EF-hands are significantly different between AtCBL2 and CNB. In the loop connecting αC and αD, the residues located at the end of αC and the loop (Leu-74 and Phe-77) make intimate interactions with the residues in the C-terminal region (Tyr-206, Pro-215, and Phe-217). As a result, αC and the loop orient inward (Fig. 2c). In contrast, CNB contains a short α-helix in the corresponding loop region and the loop protrudes toward the solvent. These structural differences induce a large conformational change in the loop region and a significantly different interhelical angle of αC and αD (AtCBL2, 50°; CNB, 132°). Although the sequence and length of the loop connecting αG and αH is similar in AtCBL2 and CNB, the loop conformation and interhelical angle of αG and αH are different (AtCBL2, 97°; CNB, 126°). This is mainly because of the interactions among the residues (Met-147 and Glu-154) in the αG and the loop, and the C-terminal region (Leu-198 and Asn-201) and the loop αC-αD (Lys-78). EF-1 (residues 58-71; Fig. 4a) displays a large conformational change due to a characteristic sequence in AtCBL2 (see “EF-hand”). Compared with the amino acid sequences of CNB and NCS-1, AtCBL2 has a ∼30-residue segment extending to the N terminus. This segment is disordered in the crystal and considered to be functionally unimportant, because the deletion mutant of the first 30 amino acids from the N terminus retains the interaction activity (21Kim K-N. Cheong Y.H. Gupta R. Luan S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1844-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic Crevice Shielded by C Terminus Region—The C-terminal regions, including 310-helices αJ and αK of the related proteins, adopt various conformations. The conformation affects the degree to which the hydrophobic crevice is exposed. The crevice is located at the opposite sides of EF-hands (Figs. 2a and 3a) and is involved in target recognition by the CNB in complex with calcineurin A (CNA) (22Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E.

Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The helices αJ of neurocalcin and recoverin extend toward this crevice, and the helix αK of recoverin is exposed to the solvent region (24Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 25Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The helix αJ of NCS-1 differs from the helices of neurocalcin and recoverin and is oriented along the edge of the crevice. In contrast to the related proteins, the C-terminal region that includes two 310-helices of AtCBL2 is plunged into the crevice so as to shield the crevice from the solvent (Fig. 3a), whereas the crevices of NCS-1, recoverin, and neurocalcin are fully or partially exposed into the solvent region. The surface area of the interface between the crevice and the C-terminal region of AtCBL2 is estimated to be ∼1000 Å2, which is within the ranges usually found for the interfaces of protein complexes (26Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar) but is much smaller than the interface of CNB·CNA complex (∼1800 Å2). The electrostatic surface potential map shows that the crevice is hydrophobic, and the interactions between the crevice and the C terminus region are formed by several hydrophobic residues. Because the residues in the C terminus region (Met-202, Leu-204, Leu-207, Phe-214, and Phe-217) are highly conserved in the AtCBL family except for AtCBL8, the shielding mechanism may be commonly shared. EF-hand—The canonical EF-hand motif is helix-loop-helix and is characterized by a sequence with the pattern X, Y, Z, -Y, -X, -Z, where X, Y, Z, -Y, -X, and -Z are the ligands that participate in calcium coordination. AtCBL2 is predicted to have three or four EF-hand motifs (EF-1 ∼ EF-4) (Figs. 1 and 4a) from the amino acid sequence, and two calcium peaks can be clearly identified in EF-1 and EF-4 from the omit map contoured at the 7 σ level (Fig. 4b). We also confirmed the number of calcium ions coordinated in AtCBL2 by electrospray ionization mass spectra. The spectra indicated that a series of ions corresponding to uptake of 0, 1, or 2 calcium ions per mole equivalent of protein, associated with Na+ adducts. After the deconvolution process of the acquired spectrum, three peaks at M r 25953.4 (apo), M r 25991.5 (+1 Ca2+), and M r 26029.9 (+2 Ca2+) were recognized associated with Na+ adducts. No ions with three or four Ca2+ adduct were observed. This suggests that the protein binds two calcium mole equivalents per mole protein, and that some calcium ions bound to the protein are removed off during the ionization or desalting process. The Lys at the Y position of EF-4 is exceptional for a classical EF-hand structure, but the calcium ion is coordinated in a typical EF-hand fashion of a pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry with the side chain carboxylate of Asp-176 (X), Asp-180 (Z), Glu-187 (-Z), the main chain carbonyl of Lys-178 (Y), and that of Lys-182 (-Y), and a water molecule (-X) (Fig. 4b). The sequence of EF-1 differs markedly from that of the classical EF-hand. EF-1 lacks highly conserved Asp residue at the X position, and three residues are inserted between the X and Y positions. The sequence also differs from that of the S100 protein family, which is well known to have a non-classical EF-hand structure. A calcium ion is, however, identified in EF-1 and coordinated in the fashion of a pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry with the side chain carboxylate of Asp-64 (Z), Glu-71 (-Z), the main chain carbonyl of Ser-58 (X), Ile-62 (Y), Leu-66 (-Y), and a water molecule (-X) (Fig. 4b). The sequences of EF-2 and EF-3, which are similar to the sequence of EF-4, are almost canonical except for Lys at the Y position, but no calcium ion is identified in EF-2 or EF-3. The structures of EF-2 and EF-3 are stabilized with many electrostatic non-covalent internal interactions (Fig. 4c). In EF-2, Asp-95 at the X position is hydrogen-bonded to the main chain atom of Gly-100 and the side chain atom of Asn-99, and Glu-106 (-Z) is hydrogen-bonded to Asp-95 and Asn-99 through a water molecule. In EF-3, Asp-132 (X) interacts with the main chain atoms of Gln-136 and Gly-137, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds are also observed among Lys-134, Gln-136, and Glu-140. In EF-hand structures that lack calcium ions, similar structural features appear for some calcium-binding proteins. p11 (S100A10) makes hydrogen bonds between the side chain of Asp (X) and main chain atoms (27Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), whereas recoverin has a salt-bridge between Lys and Glu (24Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). All EF-hands in CNB have calcium ions, whereas neurocalcin, NCS-1, recoverin, and guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2, which belongs to the recoverin family (28Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), has a disabled EF-1 hand (in addition, recoverin has a disabled EF-4 hand), because their Lys and Cys residues are unsuitable for the formation of calcium ligands. Structural analyses of several calcium-binding proteins have shown that when both EF-hands from a domain pair are occupied by calcium ions, the helices of each EF-hand exhibit open conformation related by ∼90°, and in calcium-free EF-hands the helices exhibit closed conformation with nearly anti-parallel arrangement. All the α-helices in the four EF-hand structures of AtCBL2 are well superimposed, with r.m.s.d. values of 1.3-1.5 Å for corresponding α-helices, whereas the angle between the two α-helices within each EF-hand structure ranges from 77° to 123°. This indicates that the four EF-hands in AtCBL2 adopt open conformations. As shown in Fig. 5, the CD spectrum of AtCBL2 was markedly different between a holo-form and an apo-form; the latter is derived from treating the holo-form with ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether) tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a chelating reagent. This result suggests that the AtCBL2 changes its conformation in a calcium-dependent manner and thereby functions as a molecular switch through the EF-hands. The present study is the first crystal structure analysis of proteins belonging to the AtCBL family. It revealed that AtCBL2 has two calcium-loaded EF-hands despite atypical sequence for EF-hand, indicating that, among members of this family, the number of calcium ions depends on the sequence alignment (Fig. 4a). For example, the Y position of EF-2 in AtCBL7 is occupied by Asn residue, which is suitable for the coordination to calcium ion. Likewise, each Y position of EF-3 in AtCBL1, 6, or 9 is either an Asp or an Asn residue. These structural characteristics favor the coordination of calcium ions in the respective EF-hand motifs. In contrast, the fact that four amino acid residues are deleted around the Y position of EF-1 in AtCBL6 (Fig. 4a) indicates that AtCBL6 is unlikely to contain calcium ions in EF-1. Such differences in calcium coordination within the CBL family might be related to the specificity of target recognition in calcium signaling. Ishitani et al. (6Ishitani M. Liu J. Halfter U. Kim C.S. Wei M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) showed that the mutant of a three-amino acid deletion in the EF-2 in SOS3 (AtCBL4) revealed little or no calcium binding while showing disruption of the interaction between SOS3 and SOS2. The EF-2 in AtCBL2 has no calcium ion and SOS3 probably does not contain it, because the amino acid sequences are homologous in this region. Therefore, the deletion may not cause a loss of calcium but may instead disrupt the conformation of the EF-hand kept in the open form. This would decrease the affinity for calcium ion while also increasing disruption of the target protein. It is known that the β-sheet of the C-terminal domain of calmodulin, to which calcium binds with high cooperativity, is highly twisted in the apo form, and calcium binding removes this twist (44Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 45Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 46Finn B.E. Evenas J. Drakenberg T. Waltho J.P. Thulin E. Forsen S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Therefore, this conformational change in the β-sheet may play an important role for the cooperative calcium binding, by which calcium binding in one EF-hand can affect the other EF-hand to form the calcium binding conformation. Cooperativity was observed for the pair of sites in each domain, but not between the N- and C-terminal domains. For example, unmyristoylated recoverin has one functional EF-hand in the domain and exhibits uncooperative binding of two calcium ions (47Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Lubert Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because AtCBL2 has one functional EF-hand in each domain with no myristoylation, this protein would exhibit uncooperativity, and thus β-sheet would not be related with the cooperative binding. Moreover, AtCBL2 functions as a sensor with two EF-hands (EF-1 and -4), and this structural study shows the disabled EF-2 and -3 because of the internal interactions. The target recognition mechanism by calcium-binding proteins with EF-hand motifs has been extensively studied for calmodulin, which is recognized by its interaction with the short helices in the calmodulin binding domain of each target protein (29Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of CNB in complex with CNA, the hydrophobic crevice of CNB recognizes a five-turned α-helix protruding from CNA (Fig. 3b). The helix J of CNB is pushed aside along the edge of the crevice. The affinity for the target protein might be stronger than that for the C-terminal region, because the interface surface area between CNB and CNA in CNB·CNA complex is significantly (∼1.8 times) larger than that between the hydrophobic crevice and the C-terminal region of AtCBL2. Assuming that the recognition mechanism between AtCBL2 and CIPK is similar to that between CNB and CNA in CNB·CNA complex, the C terminus region of AtCBL2 is released from the hydrophobic crevice so that it can interact with the CBL binding domain of CIPK when AtCBL2 interacts with CIPK. It is therefore indicated that the C terminus region of AtCBL2 blocks the adventitious binding of various proteins to AtCBL2 in the absence of CIPK. As stated above, the hydrophobic crevice of AtCBL2 corresponds to that of CNB and is ∼36 Å, long enough to recognize 21 or 24 amino acid residues. It should also be noted that the NAF domain or FISL motif necessary for CBL binding consists predominantly of hydrophobic residues. These structural features suggest that the CBL binding domain of CIPK interacts hydrophobically with CBL. Structural studies of recoverin family have shown that a hinge motion between N- and C-terminal domains is dependent on the calcium binding state (48Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The binding of calcium ion to the EF-hand in recoverin leads to local structural changes within the EF-hand that alter the domain interface and cause a swiveling of the N- and C-terminal domains. Likewise, it is supposed that the calcium binding to the EF-hands of AtCBL2 induces local structural changes, and a backbone hinge rotation at the domain linker allows a re-arrangement of the domain interface. The C-terminal region in recoverin partially shields the crevice, and this region has similar conformation in apo- and holo-state. Therefore, the C terminus region of AtCBL2 would have the same conformation in apo- and holo-state to shield the hydrophobic crevice. The calcium-bound structures, guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2 (28Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), NCS-1 (19Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), show similar swiveling angle of the N- and C-terminal domain. Their structures were determined by different methods, NMR (guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2) and x-ray (NCS-1 and neurocalcin), and x-ray structures were solved in the different crystal packing. These facts suggest that the swiveling angle is intrinsic and not an indication of an artifact due to crystal packing interactions.

During elongation, RNAPII has to overcome situations derived from transient pausing caused by regulatory signals with the help of transcriptional elongation factors. These factors associate with RNAPII to facilitate elongation through either particular DNA sequences or chromatin (1Shilatifard A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a set of eukaryotic factors that might also have an effect in transcription elongation. One such factor is THO/TREX. THO was identified in yeast as a four-protein complex containing Tho2, Hpr1, Mft1, and Thp2 (16Chávez S. Beilharz T. Rondón A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Null mutations in each of the genes encoding the subunits of THO confer increased recombination between direct repeats, high levels of plasmid and chromosome instability, and defects in gene expression. This is particularly evident for long and GC-rich DNA sequences such as lacZ (16Chávez S. Beilharz T. Rondón A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Chávez S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4859-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The observation that transcription of some DNA sequences is impaired in THO mutants and that hyper-recombination only occurs at actively transcribed sequences whose transcription is THO-dependent suggests that transcription elongation is impaired in these mutants (17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Piruat J.I. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4859-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Prado F. Piruat J.I. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2826-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to mutants of bona fide transcription elongation factors, THO mutants show transcription-dependent genetic instability and are not sensitive to 6-azauracil (6-AU) (17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a hallmark phenotype associated with transcription elongation defects (21Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, THO has been shown to be present in a larger complex, termed TREX, together with components of the mRNA export machinery such as Sub2 and Yra1 (22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In addition, sub2 and yra1 mutants show the same gene expression defects and transcription-associated hyper-recombination as those of the THO mutants (23Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Fan H.Y. Merker R.J. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This, together with the mRNA export defect of THO mutants, the THO-like gene expression and recombination phenotypes of mutants of the Mex67-Mtr2 mRNA export factor, and the ability of THO to bind RNA in vitro, suggests that THO might be functionally involved in mRNP biogenesis and export (23Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This conclusion is strengthened by the observation that mutants of the Thp1·Sac3 complex, which interacts with RNA and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and participates in mRNA export (25Gallardo M. Aguilera A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fischer T. Strasser K. Racz A. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Oppizzi M. Ihrig P. Lechner J. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), confer the same transcription and hyper-recombination phenotypes as do THO/TREX mutations (25Gallardo M. Aguilera A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24225-24232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Sub2 is a conserved eukaryotic protein of the family of the DEAD box RNA helicases. First identified as a protein functioning at multiple steps during spliceosome assembly (28Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Zhang M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Kistler A.L. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), Sub2 and its human (hUAP56) and Drosophila (HEL) orthologues have also been involved in mRNA transport (31Luo M.L. Zhou Z.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with RNA-RNA annealing activity (36Portman D.S. O'Connor J.P. Dreyfuss G. RNA. 1997; 3: 527-537PubMed Google Scholar). Yra1 interacts with the Mex67-Mtr2 mRNA export factor (32Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 37Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), a heterodimer that mediates the interaction of the mRNP with the nuclear pore complex (35Strasser K. Bassler J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A number of observation suggest that THO may form a core complex apart from Sub2. First, removal of Sub2 in cells does not affect the integrity of the purified THO complex (23Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Second, in a highly purified THO complex, Sub2 is a minor component and Yra1 is absent (22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Finally, there is an important part of Sub2 in the cell that is not in association with the THO complex, as observed in purification experiments using tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Sub2 (22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Despite the cumulative in vivo evidence indicating that THO and Sub2 mutants confer pleiotropic phenotypes on transcription and mRNA metabolism (17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Chávez S. García-Rubio M. Prado F. Aguilera A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7054-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 23Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), no direct in vitro proof exists yet that transcription elongation is defective in these mutants. To determine whether mRNA elongation was defective in mutants of the THO/TREX complex, we performed in vitro transcription elongation assays with two G-less cassette DNA templates (39Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that cell extracts of THO complex mutants (hpr1Δ, tho2Δ, and mft1Δ) and sub2 have significantly reduced transcription elongation efficiencies in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate that the decrease in mRNA accumulation of hpr1Δ mutants is not due to an increase in mRNA decay. It is likely that THO is not a bona fide transcription elongation factor but rather a protein complex involved in mRNP biogenesis during transcription elongation. Yet, our work provides unequivocal molecular evidence that transcription elongation efficiency is reduced in THO/TREX mutants, which is in agreement with the idea that transcription and mRNA metabolism and export are coupled in the cell. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Strains used were wild-type (W303-1A) and the isogenic mutants tho2Δ::KAN (RK2-6D) (19Piruat J.I. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4859-4872Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), hpr1Δ::KAN (SChY58-a), hpr1Δ::HIS3 (U678-1C) (17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), mft1Δ::KAN (WMK-2A) (16Chávez S. Beilharz T. Rondón A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), sub2Δ::HIS3 (Ura- segregant of DLY23), and sub2-201 (DLY33/sub2-201) (28Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have also used wild-type BY4741 and its isogenic deletion rrp6Δ::KAN (YOR001w) (Euroscarf, Frankfurt, Germany). Strains HRK-1A (WT), HRK-2B (rrp6Δ::KAN), HRK-3C (hpr1Δ::HIS3), and HRK-44C (hpr1Δ::HIS3 rrp6Δ::KAN) come from genetic crosses between U678-1C and YOR001w. His6-tagged Gal4-VP16 recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli from plasmid pRJRGAL4-VP16 (M. Ptashne, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY). We used plasmid pGCYC1-402 (39Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) for in vitro transcription elongation assays and p416GAL1lacZ (40Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) for expression analysis. Preparation of Yeast Whole Cell Extracts (WCEs)—Yeast cells were grown in rich YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) medium at 30 °C to an A 600 of 1. WCEs were prepared as described (41Schultz M.C. Choe S.Y. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), with the exception that the extraction buffer was 0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.39 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm MgSO4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.7 mm benzamidine, 0.3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin A. Precipitation and dialysis were performed as described (42Woontner M. Wade P.A. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). WCEs were distributed in aliquots and frozen in liquid nitrogen. They were stable after repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. In Vitro Transcription Assay with Whole Cell Extracts—Each reaction was performed in a final volume of 40 μl of buffer A 0.5 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 mm potassium acetate) with 100 μg of whole cell extracts and 100 ng of Gal4-VP16 purified as described (43Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and dialyzed in buffer A 0.05 (same as A 0.5 but with 50 mm potassium acetate). Final potassium acetate concentration should be <150 mm. The reaction was set up adding 20 μl of transcription buffer (2×) (final concentration was 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.03 mm CTP, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 32 μg of creatine kinase, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 7.5 units of the RNase inhibitor RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences)). After 20 min of preincubation at room temperature, 400 ng of pGCYC402 and 1 μl of [α32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were added. The reaction was stopped at indicated times by the addition of 200 μl of stop buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) and 200 units of RNaseT1 for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were treated with proteinase K, which was phenol-extracted and run in a sequencing gel as described (44Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23383-23387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of radioactivity incorporated was quantified with a Fuji FLA3000. In Vivo Analysis of Gene Expression and mRNA Decay—Ten micrograms of total RNA was prepared from induced cultures and used for Northern analysis following standard procedures (17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). DNA filters were hybridized first with 32P-labeled DNA probes as specified. For determination of the total amount of RNA used, filters were stripped and re-hybridized with 32P-labeled 25 S rDNA obtained by PCR as described (17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—DNA isolation, 32P-radiolabeling, genetic crosses, and yeast transformations were performed according to standard procedures. Whole Cell Extracts of Mutants of the THO Complex Are Impaired in Transcription Elongation—To determine whether mutants of the THO complex were impaired in transcription elongation, we used our newly reported in vitro assay (39Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This assay is based on a plasmid (pGCYC1-402) in which a hybrid GAL4-CYC1 promoter containing a Gal4 binding site is fused to a 1.88-kb DNA fragment coding two G-less cassettes separated by 1.4 kb. The first G-less cassette is right downstream of the promoter and is 84-nt-long. The second is located at 1.48 kb from the promoter and is 376-nt-long. In this assay, transcription activated by Gal4-VP16 leads to an mRNA that, after digestion with RNase T1, which degrades all G-containing mRNA sequences, leaves the two G-less cassettes intact (Fig. 1A). The efficiency of transcription elongation is determined in WCEs by the values of the ratio of accumulation of the 376-versus the 84-nt-long G-less RNA fragments. We have recently proved with this assay that transcription elongation is defective in spt4Δ WCE (39Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, after 30 min of transcription tho2Δ, hpr1Δ, and mft1Δ cell extracts carrying deletions of structural genes of the THO complex fully transcribed the 376-nt G-less cassette with efficiencies ranging from 58 to 71% of the wild-type levels. These results indicate that removal of any subunit of the THO complex leads to a similar reduction in the efficiency of transcription elongation in vitro. To determine whether or not the addition of Gal4-VP16 could affect transcription elongation in wild-type and THO mutants differently, we repeated the experiments in the absence and the presence of externally added Gal4-VP16. We first showed that, as expected, transcription initiation efficiency in the absence of Gal4-VP16, as determined by the accumulation of the 84-nt G-less cassette, was lower (22%) than in the presence of Gal4-VP16. Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 1C, the addition of Gal4-VP16 diminished the efficiency of transcription elongation similarly in hpr1Δ and wild-type cells. Therefore, the lower efficiency of transcription elongation observed in the THO mutants is independent of the transcription activator. To further demonstrate that elongation was less efficient in mutants of the THO complex, we determined the kinetics of transcription elongation in time course experiments in mutants of the two largest subunits of the complex, tho2Δ and hpr1Δ. As can be seen in Fig. 2, transcription elongation efficiency in both mutant extracts was 46-66% of the wild-type, depending on the time the reaction was run. We conclude that THO complex depletion causes a deficiency of transcription elongation in whole cell extracts. It is worth noting that this deficiency is independent of the growth rate of the strains tested, because whereas mft1Δ cells grow like wild-type cells and hpr1Δ cells grow poorly, both mutations have similar effects on transcription elongation. Whole Cell Extracts of Mutants of Sub2 Show Transcription Elongation Impairment—The THO complex is associated with proteins involved in mRNA export, such as Sub2 and Yra1, in a larger complex termed TREX. However, THO may form a core complex apart from Sub2 (22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). This, together with the fact that Sub2 and Yra1 are proteins with functional roles in mRNA splicing and/or mRNA export, makes it important to know whether Sub2 is also required for efficient transcription elongation. We applied in vitro transcription analysis to sub2 mutants. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, after 30 min of transcription, sub2Δ WCEs fully transcribed the 376-nt G-less cassette with 36% of the efficiency of the wild-type. To get further evidence of the role of Sub2 in transcription elongation, we determined the kinetics of transcription elongation of whole cell extracts with time course experiments using WCEs of the sub2-201 mutant. It has been reported that the sub2-201 mutation causes a splicing phenotype at 37 °C in WCEs in vitro that is not observed at the permissive temperature (28Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Elongation assays were performed by maintaining the WCEs at 23 °C (unheated) or shifting them to 37 °C for 15 min (heated) immediately before starting the experiment. As can be seen in Fig. 3, transcription elongation was reduced in unheated WCEs (54% of the wild-type levels after 40 min), indicating that sub2-101 was leaky at the permissive temperature for transcription elongation. However, the reduction in transcription elongation efficiency was stronger in heated sub2-201 WCEs in which the elongation levels were similar to those of sub2Δ cells (30% of the wild-type levels). This result indicates that Sub2 is required for efficient elongation. The Gene Expression Defect of hpr1Δ Is Not Due to an Increase in mRNA Decay—Recently, the question has been raised of whether the low mRNA levels observed in vivo in mutants of the THO/TREX complex could be due to a higher rate of mRNA degradation and not to a transcription defect (37Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 45Libri D. Dower K. Boulay J. Thomsen R. Rosbash M. Jensen T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8254-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It was previously observed that steady-state levels of lacZ mRNA driven from a GAL10 promoter in yra1-8 rrp6Δ mutants were ∼2-3-fold higher than those in yra1-8 mutants (37Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Also, the 5′ end of HSP104 mRNA accumulates ∼2 times above the 3′-end in hpr1Δ and sub2-201 single mutants but not in hpr1Δ rrp6Δ and sub2-201 rrp6Δ double mutants (45Libri D. Dower K. Boulay J. Thomsen R. Rosbash M. Jensen T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8254-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, these differences are very low as compared with the 20-fold decrease in expression of genes such as lacZ observed in time course experiments (16Chávez S. Beilharz T. Rondón A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and do not explain the gene expression and recombination phenotypes of THO mutants. We decided to assay whether the gene expression defects of THO/TREX mutants reflected transcription defects rather than higher mRNA degradation rates. We measured the half-life of two differently affected mRNAs in THO mutants, i.e. the lacZ and GAL1 mRNAs, both driven from the GAL1 promoter. It was shown previously that lacZ was poorly expressed in vivo in THO mutants, whereas GAL1 levels of expression were proximal to wild-type levels (16Chávez S. Beilharz T. Rondón A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, A and B, hpr1Δ and wild-type cells have similar kinetics of degradation of both lacZ and GAL1 mRNAs. Indeed, we do not detect higher levels of mRNA stability in rrp6Δ mutants (Fig. 4C). That is, mRNA stability is the same in both wild-type and mutant strains, regardless of whether or not the expression of the mRNA analyzed was affected by hpr1Δ. Therefore, failure of the hpr1Δ mutant and, by extension, THO/TREX mutants to accumulate mRNAs such as lacZ in vivo (17Chávez S. Aguilera A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3459-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was not due to an increase in mRNA decay but to low levels of transcript formation. This is consistent with the transcription elongation defect detected in vitro. The prediction of this result is that rrp6Δ should not significantly suppress the defect in the kinetics of accumulation of lacZ mRNA caused by hpr1Δ. As expected, Fig. 5 shows similar kinetics of transcription in hpr1Δ and hpr1Δ rrp6Δ strains that, in both strains, occur at 42 and 22% of the wild-type levels after 1 h of induction, respectively.Fig. 5Expression analysis of GAL1pr::lacZ construct in HRK-1A (WT), HRK-2B (hpr1Δ), and HRK-44C (hpr1Δ rrp6Δ) congenic strains.

The different mutants of the THO core complex (hpr1Δ, tho2Δ, and mft1Δ) and sub2Δ and sub2-201 showed inefficient transcription elongation in vitro, consistent with previously reported in vivo mRNA accumulation defects. We excluded experimentally the possibility that the mRNA expression defect of hpr1Δ mutants and, by extension, THO/TREX mutants, was due to high mRNA degradation rates. Several results suggest that THO has a role in mRNP biogenesis and export. First, the tandem affinity purification-tagged THO complex copurified with mRNA export proteins Sub2 and Yra1 (22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Second, mutants of the mRNA export factors Sub2, Yra1, Mex67, Mtr2, Thp1, and Sac3 showed transcription-dependent hyper-recombination and gene expression phenotypes like those of THO mutants (23Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Fan H.Y. Merker R.J. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell.

Aguilera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24225-24232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Third, THO mutants are affected in mRNA export (22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 46Schneiter R. Guerra C.E. Lampl M. Gogg G. Kohlwein S.D. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3415-3422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore important to prove that the gene expression defect observed in mutants of the THO complex was the result of an impairment of transcription elongation. Our in vitro transcription elongation assay unequivocally shows that, regardless of its particular function, THO is required for efficient transcription elongation. In an assay designed to specifically quantify transcription elongation efficiency, the hpr1Δ, tho2Δ, and mft1Δ mutants of the THO complex reduced the efficiency of transcription elongation to 58-71% of the wild-type levels (Figs. 1 and 2). THO does not have an effect on the rate of mRNA decay that could explain the differences of gene expression of THO mutants (Figs. 4 and 5). Degradation rates of mRNAs are the same in hpr1Δ and wild-type mutants, regardless of whether or not expression of the gene studied (lacZ or GAL1) was negatively affected by hpr1Δ (Fig. 4). In addition, rrp6Δ, a null mutation of the Rrp6 exoribonuclease component of the nuclear exosome, does not significantly suppress the lacZ expression defect caused by hpr1Δ. As expected from this result, rrp6Δ does not suppress the hyper-recombination phenotype of hpr1Δ mutants. 2P. Huertas and A. Aguilera, unpublished results. Our mRNA stability results are consistent, therefore, with the in vitro analysis showing a defect in transcription elongation and with the hallmark phenotype of THO mutants, a transcription elongation-dependent hyper-recombination. Sub2 is a putative RNA helicase of the DEAD box family that has been shown to have a role in mRNA splicing and export (28Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Zhang M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Luo M.L. Zhou Z. Magni K. Christoforides C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Reed R. Nature. 2001; 413: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 32Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 33Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1711-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In our transcription elongation assays, sub2 confers a reduction in transcription elongation efficiency of 30-36% of the wild-type levels (Figs. 1 and 3). This proves clearly that Sub2 is also required for efficient transcription elongation in vitro. Examples of the stimulatory effects of proteins involved in mRNA metabolism, such as splicing proteins, on transcription elongation has been reported previously. Thus, in HeLa cell extracts, specific U1 and U2 small nuclear RNPs and Sm splicing proteins are loaded onto the transcription machinery via positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) interaction and are necessary for efficient transcription elongation (47Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As shown previously for mRNA export activity, the Sub2 requirement for transcription elongation is splicing-independent. This conclusion is based on two pieces of evidence. First, the elongation defect is observed in an intron-free system (double G-less cassette). Second, at permissive temperatures sub2-201 extracts are splicing-proficient (28Libri D. Graziani N. Saguez C. Boulay J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but transcription is elongation-deficient (Fig. 3). The observation that transcription elongation in heat-inactivated sub2-201 extracts is more severely impeded than in THO mutant extracts indicates that Sub2 might be a key element in facilitating transcription elongation. This supports the idea that Sub2-Yra1 and THO represent two distinct subcomplexes of TREX. It has been hypothesized that THO may be loaded onto RNAPII-mRNP structures prior to Sub2, helping to recruit it (22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodríguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 37Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with our in vitro results and the observations that multicopy sub2 suppresses both the transcription and recombination phenotypes of hpr1Δ cells (23Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Fan H.Y. Merker R.J. Klein H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The negative effect on transcription elongation of the THO/TREX mutations does not necessarily indicate that THO or Sub2-Yra1 are bona fide transcription elongation factors (48Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this sense, spt4Δ mutants show similar in vitro and in vivo transcription elongation defects as do THO mutants. However, in contrast to THO mutants, in spt4Δ cells the in vitro transcription elongation defect is stronger; impairment of transcription does not lead to hyper-recombination, and there are no mRNA export defects (39Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The interconnection between the different steps of mRNA metabolism from transcription to mRNA processing and export (49Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) suggests the possibility that a set of proteins without a primary role in transcription may also affect transcription elongation. Consistent with this view, mutations in the Mex67·Mtr2 and Thp1·Sac3 complexes confer similar transcription and recombination phenotypes as the THO mutants do (23Jimeno S. Rondón A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 25Gallardo M. Aguilera A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gallardo M. Luna R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Aguilera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24225-24232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The effect of THO and Sub2 on transcription elongation and mRNA metabolism and export suggests the possibility, already raised, that the nascent mRNA might have a role in transcription elongation efficiency and transcription-associated hyper-recombination (48Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In summary, this study shows that there is a set of conserved eukaryotic factors, like THO/TREX, that function at the interface between transcription and mRNA metabolism and that, regardless of their specific functional roles, are required for efficient transcription elongation. Deciphering the function of these factors will contribute to understanding the mechanisms of transcription elongation, how it is coupled with mRNA processing and export, and the mechanisms of transcription-associated genetic instability.

Activation of Akt is a multistep process, which relies on the production of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositide (PI) lipids by PI 3-kinases. To quantitatively assess the kinetics of PDGF receptor/PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling in fibroblasts, a systematic study of this pathway was performed, and a mechanistic mathematical model that describes its operation was formulated. We find that PDGF receptor phosphorylation exhibits positive cooperativity with respect to PDGF concentration, and its kinetics are quantitatively consistent with a mechanism in which receptor dimerization is initially mediated by the association of two 1:1 PDGF/PDGF receptor complexes. Receptor phosphorylation is transient at high concentrations of PDGF, consistent with the loss of activated receptors upon endocytosis. By comparison, Akt activation responds to lower PDGF concentrations and exhibits more sustained kinetics. Further analysis and modeling suggest that the pathway is saturated at the level of PI 3-kinase activation, and that the p110α catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase contributes most to PDGF-stimulated 3′-PI production. Thus, at high concentrations of PDGF the kinetics of 3′-PI production are limited by the turnover rate of these lipids, while the Akt response is additionally influenced by the rate of Akt deactivation.

Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Beyond signaling of proliferation, PDGF acts as a strong chemoattractant during wound healing and can mediate protection from apoptosis in response to serum withdrawal and certain stress stimuli (2Deuel T.F.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Three forms of PDGF have been studied extensively. They are composed of disulfide-bonded homo- and heterodimers of A and B chains, of which PDGF-BB is the best characterized. There are two structurally related PDGF receptors, α and β, which exhibit different affinities for the A chain but roughly equivalent affinities for the B chain (4Östman A. Thyberg B. Westermark B.

PDGF receptors belong to the well studied class of signal transducers collectively known as receptor-tyrosine kinases (9van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev.

As with other receptors of this class, ligand-induced dimerization of PDGF receptors activates their intrinsic kinase domains, which catalyze the autophosphorylation of the receptors on multiple intracellular tyrosine residues in trans (11Kelly J.D.

The phosphorylated receptor may then act as a scaffold for specific binding interactions with cytosolic signal transduction enzymes and adaptor proteins (14Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the most important of these are isoforms of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, which phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipids in cell membranes to produce the 3′-PI second messengers PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (15Fruman D.A.

The 110 kDa α and β isoforms of the PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit are involved in receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling, and they almost exclusively phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2 to form PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, with PtdIns(3,4)P2 generated from the subsequent dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The 85 kDa regulatory subunit coordinates binding of PI 3-kinase to PDGF receptors through dual SH2 domains, transmitting a conformational change that activates the catalytic subunit (17Escobedo J.A.

Equally if not more important is the induced localization of PI 3-kinase in proximity to its plasma membrane-associated substrate (21Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.

Their general mechanism of action is the membrane recruitment and activation of signaling proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, such as the serine-threonine kinase Akt. Akt isoforms are activated in response to PDGF and other factors in a strictly PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (24Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R.

The recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane, through transient interaction of its PH domain with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(3,4)P2, is a necessary first step in Akt activation; sequential phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 (residue positions in human Akt-1) completes the process (28Kohn A.D.

A detailed molecular level understanding of intracellular signal transduction, including the PDGF receptor/PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, has thus emerged, yet our knowledge base is largely qualitative. To examine complexities such as the timing and duration of signal activation, which have been implicated as important factors governing cell function (36Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar, 37Jones S.M. Klinghoffer R. Prestwich G.D. Toker A. Kazlauskas A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 512-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a more quantitative approach is warranted. To this end, we have made reasonably precise measurements of PDGF-stimulated activation of the PDGF receptor/PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, at various times and over a range of PDGF concentrations. We were thus able to assess the sensitivity of each step in the pathway, with respect to both the magnitude and kinetics of the response. Accompanying this analysis is a proposed model that describes the pathway in mathematical terms, with a minimum number of rate parameters. We find that activation of Akt is saturated with respect to PDGF receptor phosphorylation, apparently at the level of activating PI 3-kinases. Thus, at higher concentrations of PDGF the kinetics of 3′-PI production and activation of Akt are sustained and largely limited by the rate of 3′-PI turnover. Although we found that both p110α and p110β catalytic subunits of PI 3-kinase are recruited by PDGF receptors in our cells, our results suggest that p110α contributes most to 3′-PI production and Akt activation. Another primary result of our modeling and analysis concerns the mechanism of PDGF receptor dimerization. We report that a model in which dimeric PDGF ligand binds to one receptor molecule and then cross-links a second, unbound receptor is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively consistent with our data. On the other hand, our data is completely consistent with a model in which dimerization requires the association of two 1:1 ligand-receptor complexes as an initial step, perhaps with formation of a stable 1:2 complex thereafter.

Dishes to be processed on the same day were plated with equal numbers of cells and allowed to reach at least 90% confluency. The cells were incubated for 4 h in DMEM containing 2 mml-glutamine, the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA). At various times, PDGF-BB and other treatments were added to each plate at the final concentration indicated and incubated for the time interval specified at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At the end point of the experiment, each plate was washed once with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin. After scraping insoluble debris and transferring to an Eppendorf tube, the lysates were vortexed briefly, incubated on ice for 20 min, and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were collected and stored frozen at –80 °C until use. Protein assays (Micro BCA, Pierce) were used to confirm that lysates collected on the same day contained roughly equivalent total protein concentrations. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) of PDGF β Receptor Phosphorylation—Opaque, high protein binding microtiter plates (Corning) were coated overnight with at least 375 ng of capture antibody recognizing the PDGF β-receptor extracellular domain per well. The wells were then incubated with ELISA blocking buffer (10% v/v horse serum, 0.05% v/v Tween-20 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing once with the same buffer, each well was incubated with 50 μl of ELISA blocking buffer plus 50 μl of cell lysate for 90 min with agitation at room temperature, followed by extensive washing with high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.1% SDS). Wells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine Fab fragments at 0.2 μg/ml in ELISA blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by more washes with high salt buffer. Finally, substrate solution (ELISA Femto, Pierce) was applied, and the relative light signals were acquired using a microplate luminometer (Wallac Microbeta). Akt Kinase Activity Assay—High protein binding microtiter plates (Corning) were incubated overnight with 500 ng/well protein G in carbonate buffer, followed by washes with carbonate buffer alone. The wells were then incubated with anti-Akt antibodies at 500 ng/well in carbonate buffer for 2 h with agitation at room temperature. This solution was removed, and BSA blocking buffer (10 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing once with BSA blocking buffer, 25 μl of BSA blocking buffer and 50 μl of cell lysate were added to each well and incubated for 90 min with agitation at room temperature. After washing three times with BSA blocking buffer and twice with reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA), each well was incubated with 80 μl of reaction buffer supplemented with 1 μg of peptide substrate, 1 μm ATP, 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 15 mm MgCl2 for 1 h with agitation at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 80 μl of 100 mm H3PO4 to each well. From each well 100 μl was carefully transferred to the corresponding well in a phosphocellulose filter-bottom plate (Millipore), pre-equilibrated with 100 mm H3PO4. After extensive washing with 100 mm H3PO4 and then 75% ethanol, the filter plate was dried and counted with 40 μl of scintillation fluid per well in a microplate scintillation counter (Wallac Microbeta). Quantitative Immunoblotting—Pooled cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 20 cm-wide gels using standard techniques. When immunoprecipitations were performed, each lysate was first incubated with 5 μg of capture antibodies and 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing with lysis buffer. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) and probed with the indicated antibodies. The blots were incubated with chemiluminescence substrates (Pierce) and imaged using a high sensitivity CCD camera (BioRad Fluor S-Max). All pixel intensities were within the dynamic range. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy—This technique was performed essentially as described (38Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our microscope was equipped with a Melles Griot tunable wavelength laser (60 mW at 488 nm), Zeiss upright stand, Ludl emission filter wheel with Chroma filters, and Hamamatsu ORCA ER digital CCD. The Akt PH domain was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to express the GFP-AktPH construct in mammalian cells. Cells were plated onto glass cover slips coated with poly-d-lysine and later transfected with GFP-AktPH using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The following day, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h and then visualized on the microscope. The stage was enclosed in a chamber maintained at 37 °C, and the imaging buffer was composed of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, to which PDGF-BB and other treatments were added at the times indicated. Images were acquired and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Estimation of Integrated Responses—As an estimation of the integral of a measured variable with respect to time, the trapezoidal rule in Equation 1 was employed. ∫0tNy(t)dt≈12∑i=0N-1(yi+1+yi)(ti+1-ti)(Eq. 1) Dividing the time integral by the total duration of the time course tN yields the time-averaged value of the measurement. This was found to be a robust way of normalizing data from time course experiments collected on different days. Model Computation—The coupled ordinary differential equations were solved by numerical integration using Excel. Parameter optimization was performed using the Solver tool, minimizing the sum of absolute deviations (least-squares minimization showed bias toward agreement with data for higher PDGF concentrations). Numerical accuracy was confirmed by comparing model output with different time intervals. Model calculations using the stiff ODE solver in MATLAB gave essentially identical results. Quantitative Measurements of PDGF β Receptor Autophosphorylation Kinetics Reveal a Positively Cooperative Activation Mechanism—Tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF β receptor, the hallmark of receptor dimerization and kinase activation, was measured in detergent lysates of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using a quantitative sandwich ELISA assay. In control experiments, it was confirmed that this measurement is linear with respect to the amount of lysate protein incubated in the wells under the conditions of our assay. Tissue culture plates containing equal numbers of cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, or 10 nm for durations of 2, 5, 10, or 20 min on the same day. Lysates from two unstimulated plates were also prepared. Each lysate was assayed in duplicate, and the procedure was replicated on five different days. The phosphorylation signal at each condition was normalized by the time-averaged 10 nm phosphorylation signal, integrated numerically over the 20-min time course, obtained on the same day. The means of the five experiments are displayed in Fig. 1A, as a function of time for the various doses of PDGF. At low concentrations of PDGF-BB (below 0.5 nm), tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF β-receptor achieves a steady state, and the plateau value is sensitive to PDGF-BB concentration in this regime. At higher ligand concentrations (above 0.5 nm), receptor phosphorylation is clearly transient, exhibiting a maximum value at 2–5 min. As the concentration of PDGF-BB is increased, the peak phosphorylation level becomes less sensitive to ligand concentration, and the peak occurs at increasingly earlier times. Another feature observed in the data is the presence of positive cooperativity with respect to PDGF concentration. At low concentrations of PDGF, doubling the ligand concentration yielded gains in receptor phosphorylation of 3–4-fold. Consistent with this, the peak receptor phosphorylation levels over the entire range of PDGF doses exhibit an observed Hill coefficient of 1.6, as shown in Fig. 1B. Receptor activation from 10 to 90% maximum is achieved within roughly one log of PDGF concentration, rather than the two logs predicted from single-site ligand-receptor binding. The Activities of PI 3-Kinase and Akt Are Saturated with Respect to the Number of Phosphorylated PDGF Receptors, with No Apparent Cooperativity—From the same NIH 3T3 lysates used to measure PDGF β receptor phosphorylation at various PDGF concentrations and times, we assessed the activation of Akt by in vitro kinase assay. As in the PDGF receptor phosphorylation ELISA, great care was taken here to ensure that the measurement was sensitive to dilution of the lysate applied to the wells coated with anti-Akt antibodies, and all measurements were made in duplicate. The Akt activation time courses, displayed in Fig. 2A, are clearly distinct from the kinetics of PDGF β-receptor phosphorylation. In terms of the dose response, half-maximal Akt activation is observed between 0.1 and 0.2 nm PDGF, and at PDGF concentrations above 0.5 nm, the Akt activation kinetics are insensitive to PDGF dose and more sustained in relation to receptor phosphorylation. These observations suggest that the ability of the cell to activate Akt is saturated with respect to phosphorylated PDGF receptors. To further assess the relationship between receptor phosphorylation and Akt activity, the two responses were correlated. When a signal is integrated over time, the resulting quantity is sensitive to both the magnitude and kinetics of the response. In Fig. 2B, the time-integrated Akt activity is plotted as a function of the associated time-integral of PDGF receptor phosphorylation for each concentration of PDGF-BB to assess the sensitivity of this relationship, which we term the receptor-signal response curve. In terms of time integrals, Akt activation is 50% maximal when receptor phosphorylation is only ∼10% of its maximum value. In addition, the relationship does not exhibit apparent positive cooperativity; a Hill coefficient of 1 fit the data well, far better than values of 1.5 or higher. In previous work with the same cells, the PDGF dose response and kinetics of 3′-PI production were reported (38Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), showing the same essential features observed here for Akt activation. Half-maximal 3′-PI production was stimulated in the range of 0.1–0.3 nm PDGF-BB, and at PDGF-BB concentrations of 1 nm and above, the kinetics were sustained and insensitive to PDGF concentration. These observations indicate that the pathway is saturated upstream of Akt, at the level of PI 3-kinase activation. The lack of cooperativity in Fig. 2B further suggests a roughly linear relationship between the 3′-PI level and Akt activation. Akt Activation Correlates with Receptor-mediated Recruitment of PI 3-Kinase p110α; Higher Levels of PDGF Receptor Phosphorylation Are Required to Recruit PI 3-Kinase p110β— We sought to confirm the relationship between PDGF receptor phosphorylation and Akt activation using alternative assays, and to further explore the saturation of the pathway at the level of PI 3-kinase activation. Lysates of cells stimulated with PDGF-BB for 10 min were pooled from 3 days of experiments. As shown in Fig. 3A, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of cell lysate proteins yielded intense bands at just below 200 kDa, attributed to the phosphorylation of PDGF β-as well as α-receptors dimerized in the plasma membrane. The band intensity is half-maximal at roughly 0.5 nm PDGF-BB, in accord with the ELISA measurements (Fig. 1). A similar pattern was observed when the same lysate proteins were blotted with an antibody recognizing pTyr751 of PDGF β-receptor (residue in the human receptor), one of the PI 3-kinase p85 binding sites. Akt activities in the same lysates were assessed by immunoblotting with phospho-Akt-specific antibodies. Half-maximal activation was observed between 0.1–0.2 nm PDGF-BB, in agreement with our in vitro Akt kinase assays. In parallel, the same lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the p110α or p110β catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, and the recovered proteins were probed for phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3B). Bands corresponding to PDGF receptors were readily detected in both cases, presumably reflecting the PDGF receptor-mediated recruitment of p85-p110 complexes; however, recruitment of p110α and p110β followed markedly different patterns. Whereas p110α recruitment responded to low levels of receptor phosphorylation and reached saturation at 0.5 nm PDGF-BB and above, significant p110β recruitment required higher receptor phosphorylation levels. To the extent that formation of receptor-p85-p110 complexes is indicative of PI 3-kinase activation, these results suggest that Akt activation is more sensitive to recruitment of complexes containing p110α. The Kinetics of Akt Deactivation, in Relation to Changes in the 3′-PI Level, Reveal the Influences of 3′-PI Turnover and Akt Dephosphorylation—To address the relative rates of processes that influence the activation and deactivation of Akt, 3′-PI generation and Akt activity were measured in separate experiments designed to introduce rapid increases and decreases in PI 3-kinase activity. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor the kinetics of 3′-PI production in individual cells transfected with the fluorescent probe GFP-AktPH (38Haugh J.M. Codazzi F.

https://openalex.org/W2125956028,"The structural basis of the interaction of integrin heterodimers with their physiological ligands is poorly understood. We have used solution x-ray scattering to visualize the head region of integrin α5β1 in an inactive (Ca2+-occupied) state, and in complex with a fragment of fibronectin containing the RGD and synergy recognition sequences. Shape reconstructions of the data have been interpreted in terms of appropriate molecular models. The scattering data suggest that the head region undergoes no gross conformational changes upon ligand binding but do lend support to a proposed outward movement of the hybrid domain in the β subunit. Fibronectin is observed to bind across the top of the head region, which contains an α subunit β-propeller and a β subunit vWF type A domain. The model of the complex indicates that the synergy region binds on the side of the β-propeller domain. In support of this suggestion, mutagenesis of a prominent loop region on the side of the propeller identifies two residues (Tyr208 and Ile210) involved in recognition of the synergy region. Our data provide the first view of a complex between an integrin and a macromolecular ligand in solution, at a nominal resolution of ∼10 Å.

Our data provide the first view of a complex between an integrin and a macromolecular ligand in solution, at a nominal resolution of ∼10 Å. Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors with critical roles in development, cell migration, and survival (1Sheppard D.

Ligand binding to integrins is tightly regulated in vivo and leads to the modulation of cytoskeletal assembly and spatial compartmentalization of signaling events. Affinity regulation of integrins is achieved largely through conformational changes in the extracellular (ligand-binding) domains (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6892) Google Scholar, 3Humphries M.J. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Buckley P.A. Mould A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The interaction of integrin α5β1 with the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin has served as a prototype for many of these studies. Fibronectin contains the archetypal integrin recognition sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) in its tenth type III repeat (Fn10); however, a second region of the protein strongly enhances its interaction with integrins such as α5β1 and αIIbβ3 (4Redick S.D. Settles D.L. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This synergy region is located in the adjacent ninth type III repeat (Fn9) and contains a key pentapeptide sequence Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn (PHSRN) (6Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the detailed understanding of the sites on fibronectin that bind integrin, our knowledge of the other side of the interface is limited. Early studies using mAbs 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Fn, fibronectin; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; vWF, von Willebrand factor; Fc, constant region of heavy chain of human IgGγ1. directed against α5β1 suggested that the RGD binding site was mainly on the β subunit but also at or near an interface between the α and β subunits; in contrast, the synergy region appeared to be recognized mainly or exclusively by the α subunit (7Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Importantly, the epitope of mAb P1D6 that solely blocked synergy site recognition was localized to the third N-terminal repeat of the α5 subunit (7Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20324-20336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using a gain-of-function approach, specificity for synergy region binding was also found to reside in this portion of the subunit (9Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20324-20336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray crystal structures of the extracellular domains of αVβ3 have shed new light on mechanisms of integrin-ligand binding. The ligand-binding “head” region of the integrin contains a seven-bladed β-propeller module in the α subunit (corresponding to the seven N-terminal sequence repeats) and a vWF type A domain in the β subunit (βA domain, also referred to as I-like domain), which is inserted into an immunoglobulin-like “hybrid” domain (10Xiong J.-P.

The top face of the βA domain contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and is closely interacting with the upper face of the α subunit β-propeller. A high affinity cyclic RGD-containing peptide was found to bind in a groove between the propeller and βA domain with one of the carboxylate oxygens of the Asp side chain coordinating directly to a Mn2+ ion in the MIDAS site (11Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The Arg side chain bound entirely to loops on the β-propeller. Only small conformational changes (restricted to the βA domain and the β-propeller) were observed between the ligand-free and ligand-occupied states (10Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R.

A number of issues concerning the structural basis of integrin-ligand binding are currently unresolved. (i) It is not known whether the binding of integrins to their native macromolecular ligands occurs by the same or by different mechanisms as that observed for RGD peptide mimics. (ii) The location of synergy binding sites on the integrin have not been pinpointed. (iii) It is unclear whether major conformational changes occur in the α and β head regions upon ligand binding (16Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S77-S81PubMed Google Scholar), such as the subunit separation observed by low resolution rotary shadowing electron microscopy (17Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W.

Here we have addressed these questions by determining the solution conformation of α5β1 in an inactive state, and in complex with a fragment of fibronectin, by solution x-ray scattering. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to elucidate further the location of the synergy sequence interaction site on the α5 subunit. Our data provide new insights into integrin activation and ligand binding. Materials—A recombinant fragment of fibronectin containing type III repeats 6–10 (Fn6–10), and a mutant fragment with 16 amino acid residues in Fn9 (including the PHSRN synergy sequence) replaced with the corresponding inactive sequence from Fn8 (Fn6–10(SPSDN)) (20Danen E.H.

Fibronectin fragment-Sepharose was prepared by coupling Fn6–10 to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (2 mg of protein to 1 ml of beads; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease expression vector was a gift from Gunter Stier (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The enzyme was purified from cell lysates of transformed Escherichia coli using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). mAbs 16 and 13 were gifts from Dr. K. Yamada (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIH, Bethesda, MD). mAbs SAM-2 and 4B4 were purchased from Beckman Coulter (High Wycombe, UK) and Monosan (Uden, The Netherlands), respectively. Mouse anti-human α5 mAbs SAM-1 and JBS5 were from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Mouse anti-human α5 mAb P1D6 was a gift from Dr. E. Wayner (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Mouse anti-human mAb TS2/16 was a gift from F. Sánchez-Madrid (Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain). MAbs 12G10 and SNAKA52 were produced as described (8Burrows L. Clark K. Mould A.P.

Sample Preparation—Truncated α5 and β1 constructs (α5 (1–613) and β1 (1–455)) fused to the hinge region and CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgGγ1 chain were made as described previously (21Coe A.P.F.

A double-gene vector was constructed by linearizing the α5 vector using NotI and ligating it with a NotI-NotI fragment of the β1 vector, which included the β1-Fc construct. NS0 cells (mouse myeloma, European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures) were maintained in Iscove's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (107 in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline) were transfected with 40 μg of PvuI-linearized double-gene vector by electroporation, and stably transfected cells were selected using glutamine-free medium. These cells were then cloned by limiting dilution, and integrin-expressing clones were identified by Fc capture ELISA (21Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E.

The highest expressing clone was selected for culture in an airlift fermenter (Celltech Chiroscience). Culture supernatant was concentrated 10-fold, and integrin was purified using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed into Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). The yield was ∼15 mg/liter of supernatant. Partially purified integrin was applied to a fibronectin fragment-Sepharose affinity column in the presence of 2 mm MnCl2 and eluted with Buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA. Fc domains were cleaved off using tobacco etch virus protease. The cleaved Fc domains were removed using protein A-Sepharose (this procedure also removed any remaining uncleaved or partially cleaved integrin). Purified cleaved integrin was concentrated to ∼4 mg/ml using a Centricon 80 centrifugal concentrator (Millipore) and dialyzed into Buffer A. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA assay (Perbio, Chester, UK). Analysis by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) and dynamic light scattering demonstrated that the integrin was >98% monomeric under these conditions. To produce the Ca2+-occupied α5β1, CaCl2 (100 mm) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. To produce the α5β1-Fn complex, purified truncated integrin in Buffer A was mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio with the Fn6–10 fragment in the same buffer, and MnCl2 (100 mm) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Analysis by gel filtration on a TSK G2000 column (Anachem) indicated that essentially all the integrin formed a 1:1 complex with the fibronectin under these conditions.

The studies were performed in a standard cell at sample concentrations of 0.5 to 4 mg/ml, according to established procedures (23Grossmann J.G. Hall J.F. Kanabi L.D. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3613-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Witty M. Sanz C. Shah A. Grossmann J.G. Mizuguchi K. Perham R.N. Luisi B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and all samples were measured at 4 °C. Scattering data were collected in time frames of 60 s to be able to check for radiation damage, protein aggregation, or deposition on the cell mica windows. Offline examination revealed that the samples were unaffected by the above shortcomings and allowed for a total data collection time of 90 and 100 min for trα5β1-Ca2+ and trα5β1/Fn6–10 complex, respectively. The latter included averaging several runs with fresh samples and merging data from different concentrations and two experimental set-ups. Two sample-to-detector distances (1.25 and 6.25 m) were used, and the corresponding profiles merged so as to cover the momentum transfer interval 0.006 Å–1 ≤ q ≤ 0.62 Å–1. The modulus of the momentum transfer is defined as q = 4π sinΘ/λ, where 2Θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength (1.54 Å). The q range was calibrated using silver behenate powder and wet rat tail collagen (based on diffraction spacings of 58.38 and 670 Å, respectively). The maximum scattering angle corresponds to a Bragg resolution of 10 Å. The radius of gyration, the forward scattering intensity, and the intraparticle distance distribution function p(r) were evaluated with the indirect Fourier transform program GNOM (25Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Ab Initio Modeling and Generation of Molecular Envelopes—Particle shapes were restored from the experimental scattering profiles using the ab initio procedure based on the simulated annealing algorithm to a set of clustered spheres representing amino acid residues (26Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) (GAS-BOR version 1.7 and 1.8). This yields a three-dimensional distribution of spherical scattering centers that reproduces the one-dimensional profile obtained from the scattering data. To aid in the interpretation of the reconstructed shape in terms of defined protein structures, we generated “equivalent electron density maps.” These maps were obtained by repositioning the three-dimensional distribution of scatterers in the center of a suitable box and calculating the map by standard crystallographic Fourier synthesis using crystallography and NMR system (50Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). A 20-Å resolution cut-off was imposed on these maps. Many reconstructions (>12) were performed for the different states of trα5β1, and these generated very similar but not identical shapes. A representative electron density envelope was selected from these on the basis that it showed the consistent shape features observed in the other reconstructions and also was readily interpretable from a structural point of view. It should be noted that these shape reconstructions only give an approximate fit to the experimental scattering data and thus can be used solely as a rough guide for fitting of structural models to the scattering data (see below). Homology Modeling of trα 5 β 1-Fc and Analysis of Structural Models— Because high resolution structural information is available for integrin and fibronectin domains, homology models have been built, based on the crystal structures of integrin αVβ3 and fibronectin (Protein Data Bank codes 1JV2, 1L5G, and 1FNF), to exploit fully the observed scattering features in structural terms. The homology model of trα5β1 was built as described previously (15Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19800-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with the addition of the PSI domain. The human αV and α5 subunits are highly homologous, sharing 51% identity (69% similarity) in the construct used (residues 1–613). The human β3 and β1 are also highly homologous: 44% identity, 63% similarity in the construct used (residues 1–455). Hence, the structural modeling of the truncated α5β1 is likely to be reliable. The PSI domain (which was untraced in the αVβ3 crystal structure) was modeled on an EGF repeat (an α,β-fold of similar size). PSI modeling was carried out to find a space-filling shape for placement into scattering envelopes, rather than a true structural identity. Integrin EGF repeat 3 (from 1JV2) was used as a template in XLOOK (28Lee C. Irizarry K. IBM Systems J. 2001; 40: 592-603Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An extended N terminus was repositioned by hand to create a compact fold and to give a better reconstruction of a small domain. The position of the PSI domain relative to the neighboring hybrid domain was manually adjusted to optimize the fit to the scattering data for the Ca2+-occupied state. N-linked carbohydrates were modeled on those in the ICAM-1 structure (29Kolatkar P.R. Bella J. Olson N.H. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6249-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and were attached at Asn residues that fitted the consensus Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequence. Our model of Fn repeats 6–10 in the complex was guided by reconstruction of scattering data for the Fn6–10 fragment in isolation (not shown); flexibility at domain interfaces (30Copie V. Tomita Y. Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Venable R.M. Pastor R.W. Krueger S. Torchia D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was also allowed. The Fn6 domain (not present in the 1FNF structure) was modeled on Fn7. Superimposition of shape and structural models was performed with the program SUPCOMB (31Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Models were built into the electron density maps using QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.). CRYSOL (32Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar) was used for the simulation of scattering curves from the structural models; this analysis gives a discrepancy factor χ as a measure of how well the structural model fits the experimental data. The χ value is dependent on the structural model only and is independent of the envelope reconstruction. A movement of the hybrid domain was modeled by performing an outward swing of this domain about a pivot point of Asp120 in β1 subunit. Head domain separation was modeled by moving apart the β-propeller and βA domain in increments of 2 Å. Analysis of α 5 Subunit Mutants—Mutations in the α5 subunit were carried out using oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis, as described (21Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H.

Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech (Southampton, UK). The presence of the mutations (and the lack of any other changes to the wild-type sequence) was verified by DNA sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary cells L761h variant (21Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

After 4 days, culture supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Wild-type or mutant heterodimers were purified using protein A-Sepharose essentially as described before (27Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Sandwich ELISA assays for epitope expression and ligand-binding assays were carried out as before (7Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Although wild-type or mutant heterodimers showed little ligand binding after indirect capture using polyclonal goat anti-human Fc (15Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the heterodimers were fully active after direct coating onto 96-well plates (the conditions used for these assays). In each assay involving a comparison between different heterodimers the binding of mAb TS2/16 (used at 5 μg/ml) was used to normalize for any differences between the amounts of the different heterodimers bound to the wells (15Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. McEwan P.A. Buckley P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17028-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Currently only very low resolution structural information of integrin-ligand complexes is available (e.g. by rotary shadowing) (33Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, negative staining electron microscopy offers potentially higher resolution (19Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar); however, adsorption of macromolecules to the carbon film may involve flattening and distortion, and the high concentration of heavy metal ions used for staining could induce structural changes. Solution x-ray scattering avoids these potential pitfalls and has proven to be a powerful technique for obtaining information on shape and domain organization of biomolecules (although the fine details of the molecular architecture cannot be determined) (34Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This is the case even in ab initio studies in the absence of any high resolution structural information. Nevertheless, where crystallographic data are available, as is the case for integrins, the interpretation of a scattering profile can be performed in a highly structurally relevant manner. This approach is analogous to fitting atomic subunits into low resolution electron microscopy densities of large biomolecular assemblies (35Baker T.S. Johnson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The scattering technique, however, is less time-consuming and not restricted to large, symmetrical structures (>200 kDa). For our studies we used a previously described recombinant truncated version of α5β1 (trα5β1; see Ref. 21Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35854-35866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which is a glycoprotein of molecular mass ∼160 kDa. A homology model of trα5β1 was built as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Solution Structure of Inactive α 5 β 1—To determine the conformation of the integrin in a low affinity state, x-ray scattering measurements were made in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, a cation that only very weakly supports ligand binding by α5β1 (36Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The geometrical parameters obtained from the scattering data (Table I) and ab initio shape reconstructions indicated that the integrin head region adopts a compact conformation under these conditions; a representative envelope reconstruction is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. This compact shape is consistent with the domain organization observed in the αVβ3 crystal structure (10Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), and the homology model of trα5β1 (with the identical quaternary organization of domains as seen in the αVβ3 structure) corresponded well with these shapes (Fig. 1, A and B). Because of its dependence on geometric shape, scattering data can be extremely sensitive to domain orientations and hence to conformational changes. This feature allows a robust quantitative analysis of different domain arrangements to be performed. The theoretical scattering profile of the homology model of trα5β1 was in very good agreement with the experimental data (discrepancy factor χ = 1.37; see Fig. 1C). Deviations of the theoretical scattering profile from the experimental data could be because of a number of reasons, including the mobility of the many carbohydrate groups, domain flexibility, and uncertainties in the modeling of the PSI domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Any significant domain movements incorporated into the structural model (e.g. of the hybrid domain) led to a much poorer fit to the experimental data (Fig. 1D). In summary, these results suggest that Ca2+-occupied α5β1 in solution adopts a conformation very similar to that seen in the αVβ3 structure (10Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R.

https://openalex.org/W1575453671,"Is the stratosphere, the atmospheric layer between about 10 and 50 km, important for predicting changes in weather and climate? The traditional view is that the stratosphere is a passive recipient of energy and waves from weather systems in the underlying troposphere, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. At a workshop in Whistler, British Columbia (1), scientists met to discuss how the stratosphere responds to forcing from below, initiating feedback processes that in turn alter weather patterns in the troposphere. The lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, is highly dynamic and rich in water vapor, clouds, and weather. The stratosphere above it is less dense and less turbulent (see the figure). Variability in the stratosphere is dominated by hemispheric-scale changes in airflow on time scales of a week to several months. Occasionally, however, stratospheric air flow changes dramatically within just a day or two, with large-scale jumps in temperature of 20 K or more. The troposphere influences the stratosphere mainly through atmospheric waves that propagate upward. Recent evidence shows that the stratosphere organizes this chaotic wave forcing from below to create long-lived changes in the stratospheric circulation. These stratospheric changes can feed back to affect weather and climate in the troposphere."
https://openalex.org/W2089143468,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes encoding phospholipid-synthesizing enzymes are regulated by inositol and choline (IC). The current model suggests that when these precursors become limiting, the transcriptional complex Ino2p-Ino4p activates the expression of these genes, whereas repression requires Opi1p and occurs when IC are available. In this study, microarray-based expression analysis was performed to assess the global transcriptional response to IC in a wild-type strain and in the opi1delta, ino2delta, and ino4delta null mutant strains. Fifty genes were either activated or repressed by IC in the wild-type strain, including three already known IC-repressed genes. We demonstrated that the IC response was not limited to genes involved in membrane biogenesis, but encompassed various metabolic pathways such as biotin synthesis, one-carbon compound metabolism, nitrogen-containing compound transport and degradation, cell wall organization and biogenesis, and acetyl-CoA metabolism. The expression of a large number of IC-regulated genes did not change in the opi1delta, ino2delta, and ino4delta strains, thus implicating new regulatory elements in the IC response. Our studies revealed that Opi1p, Ino2p, and Ino4p have dual regulatory activities, acting in both positive and negative transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes, most of which are not regulated by IC and only a subset of which is involved in membrane biogenesis. These data provide the first global response profile of yeast to IC and reveal novel regulatory mechanisms by these precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2139540060,"Controlled proteolysis mediated by Smad ubiquitination regulatory factors (Smurfs) plays a crucial role in modulating cellular responses to signaling of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. However, it is not clear what influences the selectivity of Smurfs in the individual signaling pathway, nor is it clear the biological function of Smurfs in vivo. Using a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell differentiation system, which is subject to control by both TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), here we examine the role of Smurf1 in myogenic differentiation. We show that increased expression of Smurf1 promotes myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells and blocks the BMP-induced osteogenic conversion but has no effect on the TGF-beta-induced differentiation arrest. Consistent with an inhibitory role in the BMP signaling pathway, the elevated Smurf1 markedly reduces the level of endogenous Smad5, whereas it leaves unaltered that of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad7, which are components of the TGF-beta pathway. Adding back Smad5 from a different source to the Smurf1-overexpressing cells restores the BMP-mediated osteoblast conversion. Finally, by depletion of the endogenous Smurf1 through small interfering RNA-mediated RNA interference, we demonstrate that Smurf1 is required for the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells and plays an important regulatory role in the BMP-2-mediated osteoblast conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2028834903,"Hsc66 (HscA) and Hsc20 (HscB) from Escherichia coli comprise a specialized chaperone system that selectively binds the iron-sulfur cluster template protein IscU. Hsc66 interacts with peptides corresponding to a discrete region of IscU including residues 99–103 (LPPVK), and a peptide containing residues 98–106 stimulates Hsc66 ATPase activity in a manner similar to IscU. To determine the relative contributions of individual residues in the LPPVK motif to Hsc66 binding and regulation, we have carried out an alanine mutagenesis scan of this motif in the Glu98–Cys106 peptide and the IscU protein. Alanine substitutions in the Glu98–Cys106 peptide resulted in decreased ATPase stimulation (2–10-fold) because of reduced binding affinity, with peptide(P101A) eliciting <10% of the parent peptide stimulation. Alanine substitutions in the IscU protein also revealed lower activities resulting from decreased apparent binding affinity, with the greatest changes in Km observed for the Pro101 (77-fold), Val102 (4-fold), and Lys103 (15-fold) mutants. Calorimetric studies of the binding of IscU mutants to the Hsc66·ADP complex showed that the P101A and K103A mutants also exhibit decreased binding affinity for the ADP-bound state. When ATPase stimulatory activity was assayed in the presence of the co-chaperone Hsc20, each of the mutants displayed enhanced binding affinity, but the P101A and V102A mutants exhibited decreased ability to maximally simulate Hsc66 ATPase. A charge mutant containing the motif sequence of NifU, IscU(V102E), did not bind the ATP or ADP states of Hsc66 but did bind Hsc20 and weakly stimulated Hsc66 ATPase in the presence of the co-chaperone. These results indicate that residues in the LPPVK motif are important for IscU interactions with Hsc66 but not for the ability of Hsc20 to target IscU to Hsc66. The results are discussed in the context of a structural model based on the crystallographic structure of the DnaK peptide-binding domain.

Although the exact role of Hsc66 in this process is unknown, the importance of Hsc66 in iron-sulfur cluster assembly may arise from its interactions with the IscU protein (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). IscU is a small, dimeric protein that is capable of forming labile iron-sulfur clusters in vitro and is proposed to serve as a template for iron-sulfur cluster formation in vivo (10Hoff K.G.

Recently, we found that Hsc66 interacts with cellulose-bound peptides containing a conserved motif of IscU (residues 99–103, LPPVK), suggesting that Hsc66 binds a single discrete region of the protein (14Hoff K.G.

In addition, a synthetic peptide corresponding to IscU residues 98–106 (ELPPVKIHC) was capable of eliciting IscU-like effects on Hsc66. The Glu98–Cys106 peptide stimulates Hsc66 ATPase activity with affinity similar to that of full-length IscU (14Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

Studies with a synthetic peptide selected using Hsc66 in affinity panning experiments, SLWPPVSGG, also suggest that the LPPVK motif is important for binding to and regulation of Hsc66 (14Hoff K.G.

This peptide contains three residues, Pro-Pro-Val, found in the LPPVK motif but exhibits reduced affinity for stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity and a decreased ability to affect Hsc66 chaperone activity (14Hoff K.G.

These results suggest that the LPPVK motif is an important determinant for Hsc66-IscU interactions, but the relative contributions of individual residues in the LPPVK motif to binding Hsc66 and regulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity are unknown. The interaction of IscU with Hsc66 is enhanced by the J domain co-chaperone Hsc20, which directly binds to both IscU and Hsc66 (2Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Together Hsc20 and IscU synergistically stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc66 greater than 400-fold (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In contrast to the IscU protein, however, the Glu98–Cys106 peptide does not function synergistically with Hsc20, and Hsc20 does not interact with IscU peptides arrayed on a cellulose blot (14Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Hsc20 may bind a region of IscU not present in small, unstructured peptides and that this interaction is necessary for synergistic stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity. The contributions of individual residues of the LPPVK motif to direct interactions between Hsc20 and IscU or the ability of Hsc20 and IscU to synergistically stimulate Hsc66 ATPase activity remain unclear. To better understand IscU interactions with Hsc66, we have investigated the effect of alanine substitutions in the LPPVK motif of the IscU protein and of the Glu98–Cys106 peptide on interactions with Hsc66. In addition, the ability of IscU alanine mutants to bind Hsc20 and to be targeted to Hsc66 by Hsc20 was examined. Our findings indicate that three residues in the LPPVK motif, Pro101, Val102, and Lys103, play key roles in interactions with Hsc66. Targeting of IscU to Hsc66 by Hsc20 can override deficiencies in binding affinity caused by these changes, but substitution of Pro101 or Val102 decreases the maximal stimulation elicited by IscU in the presence of Hsc20. The importance of residues Pro101, Val102, and Lys103 to IscU interactions with the substrate-binding domain of Hsc66 is discussed in the context of a structural model based on the crystal structure of the substrate-binding domain of DnaK.

Mutants of IscU were expressed in an iscU strain of E. coli M6 1655, in which the IscU gene was disrupted by the cat gene (designated strain OD110; James Imlay, University of Illinois, Champagne-Urbana). The cells were grown under selection with chloramphenicol and ampicillin during expression of IscU. All of the mutants were purified as for wild-type IscU and displayed similar chromatographic properties. The protein concentrations were determined using molar extinction coefficients of 11,200 (m·cm)–1 for IscU and IscU mutants, 19,600 (m·cm)–1 for Hsc66, and 16,800 (m·cm)–1 for Hsc20 based on the average molar absorption of tryptophan and tyrosine residues (15Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance studies were carried out at 25 °C using a Biacore 2000 instrument as previously described (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc.

Hsc66 in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 10 mm magnesium chloride was randomly cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip by amine coupling. The experiments were conducted in HKM buffer containing 5 mm DTT, and maximal signals were measured during 1–2-min injections. Binding of IscU appeared to be specific because no interaction was observed using sensor chips prepared without Hsc66. Binding of IscU proteins was measured sequentially at each concentration to ensure that degradation of the sensor surface during the experiment did not contribute to differences observed. The curves shown represent a least squares fit of the data to a hyperbolic saturation function. The amount of immobilized Hsc66 capable of binding IscU was estimated by comparison of the response signals obtained following immobilization of Hsc66 (≅6000 relative response units), and those resulting from IscU binding corrected for the relative masses of the proteins, assuming that IscU binds as a dimer (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—A Microcal Omega microcalorimeter (Amherst, MA) was used to investigate the binding of IscU proteins to Hsc66 and Hsc20. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C as previously described (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For Hsc66 a series of 7-μl injections of 1.5 mm IscU were made into a cell containing 1.348 ml of 0.1 mm Hsc66 in HKM buffer containing 3 mm DTT and 1 mm ADP. For Hsc20, measurements were made using 3 mm IscU and 0.2 mm Hsc20 in HKM buffer containing 5 mm DTT. The data were corrected for heat produced by the addition of buffer alone (<0.5 kcal/mol) and integrated heat caused by binding (Q inj) are plotted versus the molar ratio of IscU to Hsc66 or Hsc20 in the titration cell. Injection of IscU proteins into buffer gave a small amount of heat of dilution (<0.5 kcal/mol); the data presented are not corrected for these effects. Hsc66 Substrate-binding Domain Structural Model—A structural model of the Hsc66 substrate-binding domain was constructed based on the crystallographic structure of the substrate-binding domain of DnaK (Protein Data Bank code 1DKX) using the Swiss model program (22Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The peptides were modeled into the substrate-binding domain and energy-minimized via simulated annealing using CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase by Alanine-substituted Peptides—In a previous study, we demonstrated that Hsc66 selectively interacts with cellulose-bound peptides containing residues 99–103 (LPPVK) of IscU (14Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region, Glu98–Cys106, was found to be capable of stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsc66 with an affinity similar to full-length IscU (14Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of individual residues in the LPPVK motif to interactions with Hsc66, peptides in which each residue of the motif was individually substituted with alanine were synthesized and assayed for their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc66. Affinity panning experiments demonstrate that Hsc66 prefers peptides with aliphatic residues (14Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and alanine was used to reduce side chain size while retaining the aliphatic character of Hsc66 substrates. Fig. 1 shows the stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity observed using 10, 40, and 200 μm concentrations of each peptide. All of the alanine-substituted peptides were able to stimulate Hsc66 ATPase activity, but stimulatory activity for the alanine peptides relative to the parent peptide was significantly reduced at the lower concentrations. At the highest concentration tested, however, all of the peptides except peptide (P101A), displayed stimulatory activity within 2-fold of the wild-type Glu98–Cys106 peptide. These results suggest that whereas Leu99, Pro100, Val102, and Lys103 are important for high affinity binding, the nature of the side chain is not critical for signaling between the substrate-binding domain and the ATPase domain. Peptide(P101A), in contrast, elicited very little stimulation at all of the concentrations tested, suggesting that the nature of the side chain at position 101 is critical for interactions with Hsc66. Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis of the LPPVK Region of IscU—To ascertain the effects of substitutions in the LPPVK motif in the context of the folded protein IscU mutants L99A, P100A, P101A, V102A, and K103A were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. All five mutants displayed chromatographic properties, solution molecular masses (≅26 kDa, corresponding to the IscU dimer), and circular dichroism spectra similar to wild-type IscU (data not shown). In addition, each of the mutants was able to form iron-sulfur clusters similar to wild-type IscU (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), suggesting that the overall structure of IscU was not affected by the substitutions and that none of these residues are essential for cluster formation (data not shown). IscU Mutant Interaction with Hsc66·ATP—To investigate which residues of the LPPVK motif are important for IscU binding to the ATP-bound T state of Hsc66, we first investigated binding directly using surface plasmon resonance. Fig. 2 shows the results of titrations in which Hsc66 was immobilized on a sensor chip and exposed to different concentrations of the IscU mutants. Wild-type IscU bound with an apparent affinity of 23 μm with the maximal signal observed corresponding to ≅16% of the immobilized Hsc66. Each of the mutants displayed reduced binding affinity, and a decrease in the maximal signal was observed relative to wild-type IscU. The largest changes in apparent binding affinity were for IscU(K103A) (95 μm) and IscU(P101A) (102 μm). Because of the differences in maximal binding, however, it is difficult to interpret the results quantitatively. IscU behaves as a dimer in solution, and multidentate binding as well as surface immobilization effects may affect the kinetics of the IscU-Hsc66 interaction (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As a separate measure of binding to the ATP state of Hsc66, we examined the effects of IscU alanine mutants on the stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity. As shown in Fig. 3 all five mutants were found to stimulate Hsc66 ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner and elicit a maximal stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity equal or greater than that caused by wild-type IscU (∼7-fold). These findings suggest that substitutions in the LPPVK motif do not affect communication between the substrate-binding domain and the ATPase domain of Hsc66. However, each of these mutants displayed reduced apparent affinity compared with wild-type IscU. Alanine substitution at positions 99, 100, and 102 resulted in small (2–4-fold) increases in the concentration necessary for half-maximal stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase, but substitution at positions 101 and 103 increased the concentration necessary by ∼70- and 15-fold, respectively. The ability of the IscU(P101A) mutant to stimulate Hsc66 at high concentrations suggests that the low level of stimulation observed using peptide(P101A) may reflect a decreased affinity for Hsc66. IscU Mutant Binding to Hsc66·ADP—ATP hydrolysis by Hsc66 results in a conformational change that converts Hsc66 from the low affinity T state to the high affinity R state (3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To investigate whether substitution of Pro101, Val102, and Lys103 affects binding to the high affinity R state of Hsc66, we measured binding affinities of IscU and IscU alanine mutants directly using isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 4). Under the conditions of the experiments, Hsc66·ADP binds wild-type IscU with an affinity of ≅3 μm. This value is 7-fold higher than the apparent affinity of IscU for Hsc66·ATP (Km ATPase stimulation ≅ 22 μm). The IscU(V102A) mutant bound Hsc66·ADP with similar affinity (Kd ≅2 μm) to wild-type IscU. Replacement of Pro101 (Kd ≅ 22 μm) or Lys103 (Kd ≅ 8.5 μm) with alanine decreased the affinity of IscU for Hsc66·ADP ∼7- and 3-fold, respectively, compared with wild-type IscU. These findings indicate that residues Pro101 and Lys103, found to be important for IscU interactions with the ATP complex of Hsc66, are also important for binding to the ADP complex. Hsc20 Effects on IscU Mutant Stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase—J domain co-chaperones behave as specificity factors that guide substrates to their cognate chaperone (25Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and the interaction of Hsc20 with IscU is consistent with this behavior (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hsc20 enhances both the binding of IscU to Hsc66 (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the degree of stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity (3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether changes in the LPPVK sequence affect the ability of Hsc20 to target IscU to Hsc66, we investigated Hsc66 ATPase activity in the presence of Hsc20 over a range of IscU concentrations. A concentration of Hsc20 (50 μm) was used that had previously been shown to elicit maximal synergistic stimulation (10Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that IscU and Hsc20 synergistically stimulate Hsc66 ATPase activity ∼450-fold with half-maximal stimulation occurring at ≅5 μm IscU. Hsc20 also enhanced the binding of each of the alanine mutants to Hsc66 with the concentration of each mutant necessary for half-maximal stimulation ranging from 4 to 8 μm. These results indicate that substitutions in the LPPVK motif do not significantly affect the ability of Hsc20 to enhance the affinity of IscU for Hsc66. The striking enhancement in binding affinity for the P101A and K103A mutants, which exhibit very low affinity in the absence of Hsc20 (Km ≥ 300 μm), establishes that Hsc20 binding to IscU can override the effects of changes in the LPPVK motif. Whereas all of the mutants displayed binding affinity similar to wild-type IscU, IscU(P101A) and IscU(V102A) were impaired in their ability to elicit maximal stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity. The maximal stimulation with IscU(P101A) in the presence of Hsc20 was only 24% of that of wild-type IscU, and the maximal stimulation with IscU(V102A) was 58%. These findings indicate that the nature of the amino acid side chain at these positions affects the allosteric communication between the substrate-binding domain and the ATPase domain of Hsc66. IscU Mutant Interactions with Hsc20 —The enhanced binding affinity of Hsc66 for IscU mutants in the presence of Hsc20 could arise from an increase in the affinity of these mutants for Hsc20. To investigate this possibility, the binding affinities of Hsc20 for the two IscU mutants that exhibited the greatest enhancement in affinity for Hsc66 in the presence of Hsc20, IscU(P101A) and IscU(K103A), were examined using isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 6). Neither mutant displayed enhanced affinity compared with wild-type IscU (Kd = 28 μm). IscU(P101A) bound Hsc20 with an"

Widespread deployment of hydrogen cars could support all three objectives--but, at least for the next quarter-century, in each case there are other options that could achieve these ends faster and far more cost-effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2047415824,"Euphausiids, commonly known as krill, often dominate pelagic crustacean productivity of the world’s oceans. The ecology of these crustaceans has been extensively studied, but sources of mortality remain poorly understood. Predation and starvation are traditionally assumed to be the most important causes of death; however, little attention has been given to the identification of other sources of natural mortality (1). Here we report on a ciliate parasite with significant infection rates in euphausiid populations that causes death of the euphausiids, thus reducing productivity. During six summer oceanographic cruises off the coast of Oregon, in the United States, we collected 71 euphausiids belonging to three species, Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, and Thysanoessa gregaria, which were infected by an apostomatid ciliate of the genus Collinia. Endoparasitized adult euphausiids were collected at 7% of 313 stations sampled, mostly near the continental shelf break where euphausiids are usually most abundant (fig. S1). Shipboard incubations indicate that the infection, recognized by an orange and swollen cephalothorax (fig. S1), develops rapidly ( 24 hours) and that the parasite undergoes obligatory polymorphic stages of infection, growth, proliferation, and encystment that correspond to specific life-history stages (2). The feeding stage (trophont) consumes all the organs including the lipid-rich gonads (Fig. 1A). The reproductive stage (tomont) divides rapidly by palintomy to form transmission cells (tomites), which rupture the cephalothorax, usually killing the host within 40 hours of infection. This ciliate species is a parasitoid because it must kill the host to achieve transmission and complete the life cycle. For euphausiids, swarming confers benefits such as improving capture of motile prey, increasing the probability of mating and decreasing predation risk. However, it may also increase susceptibility to parasitism and disease. Dense euphausiid aggregations may increase parasitoid transmission after an infected animal bursts and sinks through the aggregation, distributing infective stages. This phenomenon may lead to large-scale euphausiid mortality. We observed such a mass mortality event (June 2001) at the base of Astoria Canyon, Oregon (Fig. 1B). Using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), we discovered high densities of dead E. pacifica on the sea floor between 550 and 220 m depth along almost 1.5 km of ROV transect (Fig. 1C). Euphausiid swarms and weak or dead adult euphausiids were observed close to the sea floor. Carcasses collected by the ROV contained the same parasitic ciliates and exhibited similar infection signs (partially empty and broken cephalothorax) as infected euphausiids from shipboard incubations. Infection of euphausiids by a similar endoparasitic apostome ciliate Collinia beringensis has been observed in the Bering Sea with prevalences of 68 to 98% (3, 4 ). These reports were based on preserved specimens, and the appearance of infected live euphausiids and the effects of the ciliate were unknown. The Collinia species responsible for euphausiid mortality off Oregon is currently undescribed. It is morphologically distinct from Collinia beringensis having 15 to 20 rows of cilia compared with 24 to 80 in the corresponding stages of C. beringensis. In the Northern California current, E. pacifica and T. spinifera are the dominant euphausiids ( 90% of euphausiid biomass). Our surveys suggest that Collinia sp. endoparasitism is widespread within the euphausiid population, which indicates that the large-scale mortality event we observed is unlikely to be an isolated case. Parasites and pathogens are known to control animal populations in marine and terrestrial environments (5), and members of the genus Collinia are certainly among the most virulent euphausiid parasites known (2). The epizootic character of the euphausiid mortality observed in Astoria Canyon challenges the widely held notion that mortality in pelagic organisms can be primarily attributed to predation and starvation."
https://openalex.org/W1979154802,"Phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR1) is a multiply palmitoylated, calcium-binding endofacial membrane protein proposed to mediate transbilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipids. PLSCR1 is a component of membrane lipid rafts and has been shown to both physically and functionally interact with activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and other raft-associated cell surface receptors. Cell stimulation by EGF results in Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1, its association with both Shc and EGF receptors, and rapid cycling of PLSCR1 between plasma membrane and endosomal compartments. We now report evidence that upon EGF stimulation, PLSCR1 is phosphorylated by c-Src, within the tandem repeat sequence 68VYNQPVYNQP77. The in vivo interaction between PLSCR1 and Shc requires the Src-mediated phosphorylation on tyrosines 69 and 74. In in vitro pull down studies, phosphorylated PLSCR1 was found to bind directly to Shc through the phosphotyrosine binding domain. Consistent with the potential role of PLSCR1 in growth factor signaling pathways, granulocyte precursors derived from mice deficient in PLSCR1 show impaired proliferation and maturation under cytokine stimulation. Using PLSCR1–/– embryonic fibroblasts and kidney epithelial cells, we now demonstrate that deletion of PLSCR1 from the plasma membrane reduces the activation of c-Src by EGF, implying that PLSCR1 normally facilitates receptor-dependent activation of this kinase. We propose that PLSCR1, through its interaction with Shc, promotes Src kinase activation through the EGF receptor.

Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PLSCR1 contains multiple proline-rich motifs resembling both Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-binding sites and WW domain-binding motifs (4Wiedmer T. Zhou Q.S. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PLSCR1 has been shown to bind c-Abl through its SH3 domain and to be a substrate of activated c-Abl tyrosine kinase (8Sun J. Zhao J. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28984-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Mice with targeted disruption of the PLSCR1 locus exhibit delayed fetal production of mature blood granulocytes and defective granulocytosis in response to stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) but not to interleukin 3 or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (9Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Consistent with these in vivo data, myeloid precursor cells from PLSCR1–/– mice in colony-forming assays display impaired proliferation and maturation when cultured with either SCF or G-CSF (9Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Stimulation of myeloid precursor cells by either SCF or G-CSF was also found to induce marked increases in cellular expression of PLSCR1, suggesting that it is transcriptionally regulated through these growth factors (9Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). PLSCR1 is also one of the most highly interferon-induced genes and was shown to be transcriptionally regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) and by an interferon-stimulated response element in its first exon (10Zhou Q.S.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In cells expressing receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), stimulation with EGF leads to an association of PLSCR1 with both activated EGF receptors (EGF-R) and with the adaptor protein Shc, and results in increased Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 (7Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). EGF also induces the internalization of PLSCR1 from the plasma membrane in conjunction with EGF-R. Whereas EGF-R is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded, PLSCR1 was found to recycle from its endosomal compartment to the cell surface (7Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the functional significance of the observed interaction of PLSCR1 with EGF-R and related growth factor receptors, we have examined EGF signaling in cells derived from PLSCR1–/– mice (9Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that an activated Src kinase is responsible for the Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 observed in EGF-treated cells and that this phosphorylation is required for the interaction of PLSCR1 with Shc upon EGF stimulation. Furthermore, our data suggest that deletion of PLSCR1 from the plasma membrane results in marked reduction in EGF-initiated activation of c-Src kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The murine anti-PLSCR1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4D2 (specific for human PLSCR1) has been previously described (8Sun J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28984-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and recognizes a single protein of 37 kDa in cell lysates. The mAb 1A8, recognizing mouse PLSCR1, has been developed in our laboratory and does not cross react with other PLSCR proteins (PLSCR2–4) (data not shown). Rabbit anti-EGF-R (1005) polyclonal IgG and HRP-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cdc2 peptide, purified recombinant human c-Src enzyme, and rabbit anti-Shc polyclonal IgG against p46, p52, and p66 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-c-Src mAb 327 was from Oncogene (San Diego, CA), and anti-c-Src mAb 2–17 antibody was a kind gift of Dr. Sally Parsons (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, and complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (containing inhibitors for serine and cysteine proteases) was from Roche Applied Science. AG1478, an EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and PP2, a Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and EGF was from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The Abl inhibitor, STI571, was the gift of Dr. Elizabeth Buchdunger (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). The PLSCR family members, hPLSCR1, 2, 3, and 4, were produced as fusion proteins with MBP as described previously (2Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol.

Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from embryos of PLSCR1 gene knockout (PLSCR1–/–) mice (9Zhou Q.S. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and immortalized by transfection with SV40 genomic DNA (11Tevethia M.J. Virology. 1984; 137: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Kidney epithelial cells (KECs) were isolated from PLSCR1–/– mice and immortalized by SV40 virus infection (12Woost P.G.

Mouse PLSCR1, human PLSCR1, and human Y69F/Y74F PLSCR1 mutant cDNAs were cloned into the MSCV-IRES-GFP vector and used to transfect the virus packaging cell line, PT-67, to produce infectious virus. The immortalized MEFs and KECs were infected with either mouse mPLSCR1-MSCV-IRES-GFP, human hPLSCR1-MSCV-IRES-GFP, Y69F/Y74F-hPLSCR1-MSCV-IRES-GFP, or MSCV-IRES-GFP. Infected cells were sorted by flow cytometry using GFP as indicator to collect cells with similar expression levels of PLSCR1. Expression of PLSCR1 was confirmed by Western blot using mAb 1A8. MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and KECs in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Ham's F12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 3 to 14 h prior to stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with PP2, at the indicated concentrations, for 1 h prior to EGF stimulation. After treatment of the sample with growth factor, the medium was aspirated and the cells were rapidly chilled by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes for further use.For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates containing 100–500 μg of protein were incubated with 2 μg of anti-c-Src mAb 327 or mAb 2–17, or 5 μg of anti-hPLSCR1 mAb 4D2, 2 μg of anti-Shc polyclonal IgG, or 2 μg of anti-EGF-R polyclonal IgG for 2 h on ice. Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads were added to precipitate the immune complex by rotating at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 2 min and washed extensively, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting or in vitro kinase assays.Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved on 10% Tris glycine Novex gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% (w/v) Blotto, membranes were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody and 1 h with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrates (Pierce). The following concentration of antibodies were used in Western blotting: anti-hPLSCR1 4D2, 1 μg/ml; anti-mPLSCR1 1A8, 2 μg/ml; anti-EGF-R, 0.2 μg/ml; HRP-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) PY99, 1:20000 dilution; anti-c-Src mAb 327, 8 μg/ml; anti-c-Src mAb 2–17, 1.4 μg/ml; anti-Shc, 4 μg/ml; anti-MBP, 1:20000 dilution.In Vitro Tyrosine Kinase Assay—EGF-R or c-Src immunoprecipitated from MEF, KEC, or A431 cell lysates, or purified recombinant c-Src as indicated in the figure legends, were used for in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1. In a total volume of 30 μl of reaction mixture, 4 μg of MBP-PLSCR1 fusion protein or 1–4 μg of cdc2 peptide was used as substrate in kinase assay buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm MnCl2, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μl of 1 mm cold ATP or 2 μl of 8 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature (for A431 cells), or 1 h at 37 °C (for MEFs, KECs, and purified recombinant c-Src), reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99-HRP or autoradiography.In Vitro Binding of PLSCR1 to GST Fusion Proteins—The GST fusion proteins of full-length p52 Shc were kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Bradshaw (University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA) and those of the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB), collagen homology (CH), and SH2 domains of Shc by Dr. Kodi Ravichandran (Beirne Carter Center for Immunology Research, University of Virginia). The GST fusion proteins were expressed by induction overnight at 25 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in BL21 DE3 (protease deficient) Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions.MBP-PLSCR1 was purified as previously reported (8Sun J. Zhao J. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28984-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and digested with factor Xa to release MBP. 5 μg of PLSCR1 was then phosphorylated in vitro by incubation with 5 units of purified c-Src for 9 h at room temperature in kinase reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm MnCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm ATP. For a typical in vitro binding assay, 5 μg of GST fusion protein of full-length p52 Shc or Shc domains immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with 5 μg phosphorylated PLSCR1 in 100 μl binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed extensively with binding buffer followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, resolved on a 10% Tris glycine gel, and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSPhosphorylation of PLSCR1 in Response to EGF Is Mediated by a Src kinase—We had previously observed that cellular treatment with EGF results in a transient increase in Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 (7Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An increase in PLSCR1 phosphorylation was also observed for platelet-derived growth factor and SCF, suggesting that PLSCR1 might be a substrate of a tyrosine kinase(s) that is activated through multiple growth factor receptors (14Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This indicated that PLSCR1 was a substrate of either the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases themselves or of other tyrosine kinase(s) activated through EGF-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, or c-kit, respectively, including potentially the Src family of tyrosine kinases that are known to function prominently in the growth factor receptor activation pathways (15Belsches A.P. Haskell M.D. Parsons S.J. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d501-d518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, Tyr phosphorylation of PLSCR1 upon cell treatment with EGF was found to be sensitive to inhibition by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 at concentrations of inhibitor that had only small effects on the autophosphorylation of EGF-R, suggesting that a Src kinase mediates phosphorylation of PLSCR1 under these conditions. Consistent with these data, when recombinant PLSCR1 was used as substrate for in vitro kinase assays of either immunoprecipitated EGF-R (Fig. 2A) or c-Src (Fig. 2B), only c-Src was found to mediate the phosphorylation of PLSCR1. Because Src kinases are known to phosphorylate and activate c-Abl (16Furstoss O. Dorey K. Simon V. Barilà D. Superti-Furga G. Roche S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a tyrosine kinase that was previously shown to phosphorylate PLSCR1, we also considered the possibility that contaminating c-Abl in the c-Src immunoprecipitates might account for the observed phosphorylation of PLSCR1. Whereas phosphorylation of PLSCR1 was prevented in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, the Abl kinase inhibitor, STI571, failed to inhibit phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated c-Src, which further implicates c-Src as the kinase responsible for phosphorylating PLSCR1 under these conditions (Fig. 2B). Additional supporting evidence for c-Src as the kinase involved was obtained using purified recombinant human c-Src, expressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells, which was also found to phosphorylate PLSCR1 (Fig. 3A) and was sensitive to the Src kinase family inhibitor, PP2 (Fig. 3A). Among the known human PLSCR family members, only PLSCR1 was observed to be phosphorylated by purified c-Src (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2In vitro phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by immunoprecipitated c-Src. A431 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 30 s, and cell lysates were prepared. A, EGF-R was immunoprecipitated with anti-EGF-R polyclonal antibody and subjected to kinase assays using [γ-32P]ATP with MBP-PLSCR1 as substrate.

We found that mutation at both Tyr69 and Tyr74 was required to eliminate PLSCR1 phosphorylation by both Src immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (results not shown) and purified recombinant c-Src (Fig. 4A), or in EGF-stimulated cells transfected with wild type (WT) or mutant PLSCR1 (Fig. 4B). These Tyr residues are within the same tandem repeat sequence 68VYNQPVYNQP77 that we have previously identified as the sites required for phosphorylation of PLSCR1 mediated by c-Abl. Mutation at either Tyr69 or Tyr74 markedly reduced but did not abolish the phosphorylation by c-Src, whereas phosphorylation was eliminated when both residues were replaced with Phe (Fig. 4 and data not shown), implying the potential for phosphorylation at both sites.Fig. 4Tyrosine residues in the tandem repeat sequence 68VYNQPVYNQP77 of PLSCR1 are required for phosphorylation by c-Src. A, purified recombinant c-Src was used in kinase assays with either wild type MBP-PLSCR1 or mutant MBP-Y69F/Y74F-PLSCR1 as substrate. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and the phosphorylated proteins detected by Western blotting (WB) with HRP-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99 (top panel). MBP-PLSCR1 was detected with anti-MBP (bottom panel). Data shown are representative of 2 experiments performed. B, PLSCR1–/– KECs expressing either wild type hPLSCR1, mutant Y69F/Y74F-PLSCR1, or vector alone were stimulated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml EGF after pretreatment with 0.1 mm pervanadate. Cell lysates were prepared, and PLSCR1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PLSCR1 mAb 4D2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 was detected with HRP-conjugated anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY99 (upper panel) and PLSCR1 with anti-PLSCR1 mAb 4D2 (lower panel). Data shown are representative of 2 experiments performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The EGF-mediated Interaction between PLSCR1 and Shc Requires Phosphorylation of Tyr69 and Tyr74 in PLSCR1—We have previously observed increased association of PLSCR1 with both the adaptor protein Shc and EGF-R in response to cell treatment with EGF (7Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the increased binding of PLSCR1 to Shc adaptor protein is dependent on the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of PLSCR1. As shown in Fig. 5, in KECs expressing wild type PLSCR1, stimulation with EGF resulted in increased association of PLSCR1 with Shc. In contrast, little or no association with Shc was observed for mutant Y69F/Y74F PLSCR1 upon cell treatment with EGF. These results clearly indicate that the EGF-induced association between PLSCR1 and Shc requires the c-Src phosphorylation site(s) Tyr69 and Tyr74 of PLSCR1.Fig. 5EGF-dependent association between PLSCR1 and Shc requires phosphotyrosine residues Tyr69 and Tyr74 of PLSCR1. PLSCR1–/– KEC expressing either wild type or Y69F/Y74F hPLSCR1 were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for times shown. Cell lysates were prepared, and Shc was immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc polyclonal antibody. The amount of PLSCR1 co-immunoprecipitated with Shc was detected by Western blotting (WB) with anti-PLSCR1 (upper panel). Phosphorylation of Shc proteins was detected with anti-Tyr(P) antibody (middle panel). Abundance of immunoprecipitated p66 Shc proteins was detected with anti-Shc polyclonal antibody (lower panel).

Full-length p52 Shc, and the PTB, CH, and SH2 domains of Shc were expressed as GST fusion proteins and used to interact with PLSCR1 that had been phosphorylated by c-Src. Of the various domains of Shc, only full-length p52 Shc and the PTB domain of Shc were observed to bind phosphorylated PLSCR1 (Fig. 6). Consistent with this, Tyr(P) PLSCR1 was depleted in the supernatants after pull down with full-length Shc and PTB, compared with the GST control and the other Shc domains tested. These results suggest that interaction of phosphorylated PLSCR1 with Shc is mediated predominantly by the PTB domain. In the absence of phosphorylation, some interaction of PLSCR1 with full-length Shc and its PTB domain was also observed (see “Discussion”).Fig. 6PLSCR1 binds to Shc through the PTB domain in vitro. PLSCR1 was phosphorylated in vitro using purified recombinant c-Src (see “Experimental Procedures”).

In addition, as measured by tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-dextran uptake, a robust (>100-fold) increase in the rate of endocytosis was observed, starting after a discrete lag time of 2–3 min and lasting for ∼10–15 min. The hypotonicity-induced increase in membrane surface area, like the cell swelling-induced release of ATP (Van der Wijk, T., De Jonge, H. R., and Tilly, B. C. (1999) <i>Biochem. J.</i> 343, 579–586), was diminished after 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>′,<i>N</i>′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester loading or cytochalasin B treatment. Uptake of TRITC-dextrans, however, was not affected. Treatment of the cells with the vesicle-soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor-specific protease <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> toxin F not only nearly eliminated the hypotonicity-induced increase in membrane surface area but also strongly diminished the release of ATP, indicating the involvement of regulated exocytosis. Both the ATP hydrolase apyrase and the MEK inhibitor PD098059 diminished the osmotic swelling-induced increase in membrane surface area as well as the subsequent uptake of TRITC-dextrans. Taken together, the results indicate that extracellular ATP is required for the hypotonicity-induced vesicle recycling and suggest that a positive feedback loop, involving purinergic activation of the Erk-1/2 pathway, may contribute to the release of ATP from hypo-osmotically stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013115509,"The interaction of dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex (DNDGIC), a natural carrier of nitric oxide, with representative members of the human glutathione transferase (GST) superfamily, i.e. GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, GSTP1-1, and GSTT2-2, has been investigated by means of pre-steady and steady state kinetics, fluorometry, electron paramagnetic resonance, and radiometric experiments. This complex binds with extraordinary affinity to the active site of all these dimeric enzymes; GSTA1-1 shows the strongest interaction (K D ≅ 10−10m), whereas GSTM2-2 and GSTP1-1 display similar and slightly lower affinities (K D ≅ 10−9m). Binding of the complex to GSTA1-1 triggers structural intersubunit communication, which lowers the affinity for DNDGIC in the vacant subunit and also causes a drastic loss of enzyme activity. Negative cooperativity is also found in GSTM2-2 and GSTP1-1, but it does not affect the catalytic competence of the second subunit. Stopped-flow and fluorescence data fit well to a common minimal binding mechanism, which includes an initial interaction with GSH and a slower bimolecular interaction of DNDGIC with one high and one low affinity binding site. Interestingly, the Theta class GSTT2-2, close to the ancestral precursor of GSTs, shows very slow binding kinetics and hundred times lowered affinity (K D ≅ 10−7m), whereas the bacterial GSTB1-1 is not inhibited by DNDGIC. Molecular modeling and EPR data reveal structural details that may explain the observed kinetic data. The optimized interaction with this NO carrier, developed in the more recently evolved GSTs, may be related to the acquired capacity to utilize NO as a signal messenger.

The human cytosolic GSTs are homo- or heterodimeric proteins, encoded by distantly related gene families and grouped into eight classes termed Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Omega, Pi, Sigma, Theta, and Zeta (2Mannervik B.

The most important reaction catalyzed by GSTs is the conjugation of the sulfur atom of GSH to an electrophilic center of many toxic organic compounds. The Alpha class also shows an additional selenium-independent peroxidase activity with organic peroxides (9Mannervik B. Chem. Scr. 1986; 26: 281-284Google Scholar). Other physiological roles of GSTs include chemical sequestration (10Litwach G. Ketterer B. Arias I.M. Nature. 1971; 234: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), regulation of the Jun kinase protein (11Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Ardana M.

Recently, we described the peculiar interaction between GSTP1-1 and dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex (DNDGIC) (Scheme 1), a natural nitric oxide carrier that binds to the G-site with thousand times higher affinity than GSH (18Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DNDGIC, which can be formed in vivo by free NO or NO donors, GSH, and traces of ferrous ion, is a paramagnetic molecule with a diagnostic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum centered at about g = 2.03 both in the frozen state at 77 and at 298 K (19Ueno T. Yoshimura T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The occurrence of dinitrosyl-iron complexes (DNICs) in mammalian tissues and cells was observed more than 30 years ago after exposure of tissues to endogenous or exogenous NO (19Ueno T. Yoshimura T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In vivo, DNDGIC and other low mass DNICs could be in equilibrium with several protein-bound forms after replacing one or both the free thiol ligands with protein residues like His, Cys and Ser (19Ueno T. Yoshimura T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both low mass and high mass DNICs seem to be more stable than NO and may possibly act as storage of nitric oxide (20Mulsh A. Mordvintcev P. Vanin A.F. Busse R.

Serezhenkov V.A. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). DNICs also inhibit platelet aggregation (24Vanin A.F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), reduce blood pressure (25Manukhina E.B. Malyshev I.Y. Malenyuk E.B. Zenina T.A. Pokidyshev D.A. Mikojan V.D. Kubrina L.N.

(Lond.). 2000; 529: 735-745Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The recently discovered interaction of DNDGIC with GSTP1-1 is of particular interest as this complex possibly represents the most potent natural competitive inhibitor of this enzyme (18Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A particular intersubunit communication triggered by DNDGIC was also found, which lowers the affinity of the adjacent subunit. EPR spectroscopy and molecular modeling indicated that DNDGIC is stabilized in the G-site through the usual polar and hydrophobic interactions of protein residues with one GSH molecule, coordination of the iron ion to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-7, and additional van der Waals interactions of NO moieties with Ile-104 and Tyr-108 (18Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This interaction is quite surprising as it is a common opinion that the G-site recognizes GSH (and a few GSH analogs) almost exclusively. In addition, cooperative intersubunit communication in GSTP1-1 has only been observed after a few selected point mutations (30Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W.

The tight interaction between GSTP1-1 and an endogenous NO carrier is also indicative of an additional physiological role for this enzyme as an NO-storage protein. The surprising results of this paper demonstrate that not only GSTP1-1 but all representative members of mammalian GSTs interact with DNDGIC showing similar binding mechanism and cooperativity. Enzyme Expression and Purification—Human GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (18Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol.

Expression of the human GSTT2-2 and its purification using immobilized metal ion chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were carried out as reported previously (35Tan K.-L. Chelvanayagam G. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Flanagan J.U. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Chelvanajagam G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the bacterial GSTB1-1 was performed as described in Ref. 37Perito B. Allocati N. Casalone E. Masulli M. Dragani B. Polsinelli M. Aceto A. DI Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. The enzyme concentrations reported in the text for all GSTs refer to the single subunit. DNDGIC Synthesis—DNDGIC was prepared essentially as described previously (18Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of 0.5 mm FeSO4 (dissolved in degassed water to avoid rapid oxidation to the ferric state) was added to 10 ml (final volume) of 0.1 m of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm GSH and 2 mm GSNO (25 °C). After 10 min, the reaction was almost complete, and the resulting stock solution of DNDGIC (50 μm) was stable for at least 3 h. For the sake of simplicity, we have used the abbreviation DNDGIC also for the complex bound to GSTs, although the latter is shown to be a monoglutathionyl species. Inhibition Experiments—Inhibition of GSTA1-1, GSTP1-1, and GSTM2-2 by DNDGIC was studied by incubating variable amounts of DNDGIC (from 0.4 to 9 μm) with a fixed enzyme concentration (4 μm) in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (25 °C). After 2 min, 4-μl aliquots were diluted in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm GSH and 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). The enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (25 °C) (ϵ = 9,600 m-1 cm-1 for the DNB-GSH adduct) within 10 s from addition of the substrates. This procedure, mentioned in the text as “assay under non-equilibrium conditions” gives a snapshot of the binding situation as it occurs in the incubation mixture and not in the final assay solution because of the slow extrusion of DNDGIC by 10 mm GSH (see “Results”). The inhibition of the low affinity binding site was followed by incubating variable amounts of DNDGIC (from 0.1 to 10 μm) with 40 nm of GSTs (20 nm for GSTM2-2) in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 5 min, the pH was adjusted to 6.5, and the concentration of GSH was brought to 10 mm, and 1 mm of CDNB was added rapidly. Residual activity was determined within 10 s from addition of substrates. GSTT2-2 (1.5 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with variable amounts of DNDGIC (from 0.75 to 15 μm) in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 10 min, 10 mm GSH and 0.25 mm menaphthyl sulfate (Msu) were added for activity measurements at 298 nm (38Gillham B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). GSTB1-1 (1 μm) was incubated at 25 °C with variable amounts of DNDGIC (from 0.75 to 15 μm) in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 10 min, the pH was adjusted to 6.5, and 10 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB were rapidly added for activity measurements at 340 nm. Inhibition experiments termed “under equilibrium conditions” were performed as described above with the exception that DNDGIC was incubated with each enzyme for 5 min (40 min for GSTT2-2) in the presence of a fixed GSH concentration (10 mm). After incubation with DNDGIC, aliquots were diluted in the assay mixture containing 10 mm GSH. After 5 min (40 min for GSTT2-2), 1 mm CDNB (1 mm menaphthyl sulfate for GSTT2-2) was added for activity determination. Data were fitted to a bi-exponential decay equation. Fluorescence Experiments—Quenching of intrinsic fluorescence by DNDGIC was measured in a single photon counting spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax, S.A. Instruments, Paris, France) with a sample holder thermostatted at 25 °C (37 °C for GSTT2-2). Excitation was at 280 nm and emission at 340 nm. In a typical experiment GST (2 μm) was incubated with variable amounts of DNDGIC (from 0.2 to 20 μm)in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm GSH and 1 mm GSNO. After 5 min (40 min for GSTT2-2), the fluorescence at 340 nm was measured and corrected for inner filter effect. Data were fitted to a bi-exponential decay equation. Pre-steady State Kinetic Experiments—Rapid kinetic experiments were performed on a Applied Photophysics Kinetic spectrometer stopped-flow instrument equipped with a 1-cm light path observation chamber thermostatted at 25 °C (37 °C for GSTT2-2). In a typical experiment 4 μm GST in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was rapidly mixed with an identical volume of the same buffer containing 5 μm DNDGIC, 20 mm GSH, and 2 mm GSNO. The reaction was followed by fluorescence changes at 320 nm (excitation at 280 nm; bandwidth 20 nm) and repeated at three different complex concentrations (5, 15, and 45 μm) and four different GSH (from 2 to 60 mm) and GSNO (from 0.2 to 6 mm) concentrations keeping the ratio GSH:GSNO constant at 10. Thousand data points were obtained on a logarithmic time scale. The experimental traces obtained at nine different DNDGIC and GSH (plus GSNO) concentrations were simultaneously fitted to Scheme 2 using the program Gepasi 3.21 (39Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 41Mendes P. Kell D.B. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 869-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The program carries out the non-linear minimization of the kinetic constants by means of numerical integration, at variable steps, of the ordinary differential equation according to Scheme 2, where E is each subunit with high affinity, E * is the subunit with low affinity, C is DNDGIC, and E·GSH is the pre-complex found in the GSH binding mechanism to GSTA1-1, GSTP1-1, and GSTM2-2 (42Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Nicotra M. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GSH binding to GSTT2-2 lacks the pre-complex intermediate (43Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G. Lo Bello M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5427-5431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). EPR Experiments—Samples for EPR experiments were usually prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with DNDGIC added from a freshly made stock solution. EPR measurements were made at room temperature (22-25 °C) with a Bruker ESP300 X-band instrument (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a high sensitivity TM110-mode cavity. To optimize instrument sensitivity, spectra were recorded using samples of 80 μl contained in flat glass capillaries (inner cross-section 5 × 0.3 mm) (44Pedersen J.Z. Cox R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 369-371Google Scholar). For kinetics measurements standard round glass capillaries (1.10 mm inner diameter) with a working volume of 40 μl were applied, to allow rapid handling of samples. Unless otherwise stated spectra were measured over a 200 G range using 20 milliwatts power, 2.0 G modulation, and a scan time of 42 s; typically 4-40 single scans were accumulated to improve the signal to noise ratio. High resolution spectra were recorded with 0.1 G modulation and 2 milliwatts power. Simulation of anisotropic spectra was carried out using the SimFonia software provided by Bruker. Radiometric Experiments—[3H]GSH (glycine-2-3H) (50 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]DNDGIC was prepared by reacting 20 mm [3H]GSH (100 μCi/mmol) with 2 mm GSNO and 50 μm FeSO4 in 1 ml (final volume) of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After 30 min at 25 °C, [3H]DNDGIC was quantitatively formed. GSTA1-1 (4 μm) was incubated with 2 μm [3H]DNDGIC in the same buffer for 5 min. The amount of the complex bound to the high affinity site (more than 90%) was estimated on the basis of the observed inhibition. The solution was rapidly filtered on a Whitman 3MM filter paper. The filter was washed twice with 1 ml of cold buffer to remove excess of [3H]GSH and of unbound [3H]DNDGIC. The dried filter was dipped into 3 ml of Optifluor and, after 6 h, the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Blank experiments, in the absence of FeSO4 or GSTA1-1 were performed to evaluate the amount of spurious radioactivity retained by the filter or by the protein. DNDGIC Exchange between GSTM2-2 and GSTA1-1—GSTM2-2 (2.5 μm) was reacted for 5 min with 1.25 μm DNDGIC in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Residual activity determined with CDNB was 52% of the initial value. The enzyme was then added to an identical volume of the same buffer containing 2.5 μm GSTA1-1. By taking advantage of the different specific activities of GSTA1-1 and GSTM2-2 toward CDNB (80 and 200 units/mg, respectively) and NBD-Cl (40 and 3 units/mg, respectively), the concentration of the bound and free forms of each enzyme was calculated at fixed incubation times. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was performed by using the program Insight II (release 2000; MSI, San Diego). The models were based on the crystallographic coordinates of the different GSTs in complex with GSH, as obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank: A1-1, entry 1guh (2.6 Å resolution); M2-2, entry 1hna (1.85 Å resolution); P1-1, entry 6gss (1.9 Å resolution); and T2-2, entry 1ljr (3.2 Å resolution). The procedure followed was very similar to that already reported for GST P1-1 (18Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); the GSH-dinitrosyl-iron complex model was docked in the active site of the enzyme by assuming that the GSH molecule was in the same position and conformation as in the crystal structure of the enzyme-GSH complex. After adding the iron atom and the two NO molecules by assuming a tetrahedral geometry for the complex, it was immediately evident that the hydroxyl moiety of a Tyr or Ser residue (Tyr-9 in GST A1-1, Tyr6 in M2-2, Tyr-7 in P1-1, and Ser-11 in T2-2) was always at the appropriate distance and orientation to act as the fourth ligand of the iron atom, and therefore this coordination bond was added. Bond distances and angles were determined by the Builder module of the Insight II program. Finally the model was energy-minimized to convergence while keeping all the protein atoms fixed (except those of the Tyr or Ser residue), using the Discover module of Insight II and the CVFF force field (45Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). For comparison purposes, a similar minimization was performed also for the GSH molecule in the crystallographic enzyme-GSH complex. Graphic representation of the final model was produced by the program MOLMOL (46Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Inhibition Experiments—In a first experimental approach, the interaction of DNDGIC with representative members of the GST superfamily was studied on the basis of the competitive inhibition by DNDGIC. Under the experimental conditions used previously for GSTP1-1 (18Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the inhibition of GSTM2-2 at variable DNDGIC concentrations shows a biphasic behavior close to that found for GSTP1-1, suggesting a similar cooperative mechanism that lowers the affinity of the vacant subunit for DNDGIC (Fig. 1). Binding to the high affinity G-site is so efficient that low amounts of DNDGIC inhibit stoichiometrically up to about 50% of the original activity. Because it is not possible to determine the trace amounts of free complex in solution in this first phase, only an apparent upper limit value of K i1 ≤ 10-11m can be estimated for the high affinity binding site, whereas the affinity of the low affinity binding site can be calculated more accurately (K i2 = 1.3 × 10-8m). The cooperative mechanism triggered by DNDGIC binding does not modify the affinity for GSH as suggested by an unchanged K m value found in half-inactivated GSTM2-2 (data not shown). The Alpha class GSTA1-1 also shows strong affinity (apparent K i1 ≤ 10-11m), but only 10% of the total activity remains when one active site of the dimeric protein binds one DNDGIC (Fig. 1). Because of the very low residual activity of the second subunit, only an approximate K i2 value of about 10-8m can be evaluated for the low affinity binding site. The inhibition of the vacant active site is not caused by a change of affinity for GSH. In fact, the half-complexed enzyme with DNDGIC shows an unchanged K m value for GSH (0.18 mm). A negative influence of DNDGIC bound to one subunit on the deprotonation of GSH (crucial in catalysis) in the adjacent subunit is also unlikely. In fact, the k cat versus pH plot overlaps that found for the native enzyme, showing that the pK a value of GSH is unchanged (experiments not shown). Thus, unproductive binding of GSH is possibly involved in the observed overinhibition. GSTT2-2 shows a different behavior. This enzyme, probably developed before Alpha, Pi, and Mu class GSTs in the evolutionary pathway (43Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Flanagan J. Parker M.W. Paolesse R. Turella P. Federici G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5432-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), shows a small and buried G-site, and a Ser residue (Ser-11) replaces the Tyr residue found in the more recently evolved GSTs which is essential for the activation of the bound GSH. GSTT2-2 displays a hundred times lower affinity for DNDGIC (apparent K i1 ≤ 4 × 10-6m, Fig. 1), whereas the biphasic inhibition pattern suggests a similar negative cooperativity. The high concentration of enzyme used in these kinetic experiments (due to the very low specific activity of GSTT2-2) and the low concentration of the DNDGIC stock solution do not allow measurement of reliable K i2 values for the low affinity binding site. Interestingly, the bacterial GSTB1-1, which binds GSH with low affinity and lacks a Tyr or Ser residue for GSH activation, shows an unchanged activity even in the presence of 10 moles excesses of DNDGIC (Fig. 1), indicating that this more primitive enzyme has scarce affinity for this complex. Apparently all inhibition experiments reported above gave reliable data, but caution must be taken in kinetic studies involving tight binding inhibitors. It is not unusual that they need minutes and sometimes hours to reach steady state conditions. Thus, further analysis is required to check possible occurrence of slow reacting species in the DNDGIC-GST system. DNDGIC Binding and Extrusion from the Active Site Are Slow Events—Binding of stoichiometric amounts of DNDGIC to the G-site of all representative GST members is a relatively slow event. As expected on the basis of a reciprocal competition of GSH and DNDGIC for the same G-site, the presence of increasing concentrations of GSH lowers the rate of the binding process and the extent of the final inhibition. By using 1 mm GSH, 2 μm enzyme, and 2 μm DNDGIC, kinetics of binding has t ½ values of 7, 13, and 11 s for GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1, respectively (Fig. 2). GSTT2-2 exhibits the lowest rate of DNDGIC binding with a t ½ of 100 s (Fig. 2). In the presence of 10 mm GSH (the highest GSH concentration present in our kinetics experiments), a reasonable equilibrium (i"

Rim2, a homologous protein, is more ubiquitously expressed and is found in neuroendocrine cells as well as in brain. Both Rim1 and Rim2 contain multiple domains, including an N-terminal zinc finger, which in Rim1 strongly enhances secretion in chromaffin and PC12 cells. The yeast two-hybrid technique identified 14-3-3 proteins as ligands of the N-terminal domain. In vitro protein binding experiments confirmed a high-affinity interaction between the N terminus of Rim1 and 14-3-3. The N-terminal domain of Rim2 also bound 14-3-3. The binding domains were localized to a short segment just C-terminal to the zinc finger. 14-3-3 proteins bind to specific phosphoserine residues. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of N-terminal domains of Rim1 and Rim2 almost completely inhibited the binding of 14-3-3. Two serine residues in Rim1 (Ser-241 and Ser-287) and one serine residue in Rim2 (Ser-335) were required for 14-3-3 binding. Incubation with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II greatly stimulated the interaction of recombinant N-terminal Rim but not the S241/287A mutant with 14-3-3, again indicating the importance of the phosphorylation of these residues for the binding.Rabphilin3, another Rab3a effector, also bound 14-3-3. Serine-to-alanine mutations identified Ser-274 as the likely phosphorylated residue to which 14-3-3 binds. Because the phosphorylation of this residue had been shown to be stimulated upon depolarization in brain slices, the interaction of 14-3-3 with Rabphilin3 may be important in the dynamic function of central nervous system neurons.

The Rab3 family of low molecular weight guanosine triphosphatases associates with secretory granules and synaptic vesicles and plays a role in exocytosis. Rim1 was originally identified in brain as a Rab3-binding protein that is localized to the cytomatrix of the active zone in presynaptic nerve terminals (1Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofman K. Sudhof T. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). It is a large protein (∼1553 amino acids) containing a zinc finger domain, a PDZ domain, and two C2 domains (Fig. 1B). It has similarities to several related proteins, which are also localized to the presynaptic cytomatrix, e.g. Piccolo, Aczonin (2Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M.

Because of its many motifs, Rim may act as a common protein scaffold for modulators of presynaptic function. Indeed, gene knock-out experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans (9Koushika S.P. Richmond J.E.

The ability of Rim1 to modulate secretion has been investigated in neuroendocrine cells, which, like neurons, have a highly differentiated, regulated exocytotic pathway.

The functional implications of some of these interactions have been investigated. The interaction of Rim1 with Rab3a-GTP is unnecessary for the ability of Rim to enhance secretion from neuroendocrine cells because Rim1 mutants without the ability to bind Rab3a-GTP enhance secretion (12Sun L. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12911-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Munc13 proteins regulate neurotransmitter release at the active zone and strongly enhance primed secretion from chromaffin cells (17Ashery U. Varoqueaux F. Voets T. Betz A. Thakur P. Koch H. Neher E.

Although the N-terminal domain of Munc13 interacts with Rim1, this interaction in chromaffin cells is not important for the enhancement of secretion by Munc13 (15Betz A. Thakur P. Junge H.J.

In neurons, the interaction of Rim with Munc13 speeds the ability of transiently expressed Munc13-1 to restore function in mice lacking Munc13-1 (15Betz A. Thakur P. Junge H.J. Ashery U. Rhee J.

Cyclic AMP-GEFII enhances secretion from PC12 and insulin-secreting cells through a mechanism that requires both interaction with Rim2 and the direct binding of cyclic AMP. In a previous study we had localized the region of Rim1 necessary for the enhancement of secretion to a 90-amino acid segment, Rim1(51–190), which encompasses the zinc finger domain (the amino acid numbering reflects splice variants). We demonstrated that the intact zinc finger is necessary for the enhancement of secretion (12Sun L. Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12911-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The segment did not include the N-terminal peptide that binds Rab3-GTP. The zinc finger domain probably acts at a relatively late step in the exocytotic pathway because direct addition to permeabilized chromaffin cells of a peptide encompassing the domain enhances Ca2+-dependent catecholamine secretion. 2L. Sun, M. A. Bittner, and R. W. Holz, unpublished observations. These results provided the rationale for the yeast two-hybrid analysis used in the present study to identify potential protein ligands of the zinc finger and nearby domains. We found that the N-terminal domain of Rim interacts with the 14-3-3 family of proteins, identified the sites of interaction, and investigated the functional effects of the interaction. 14-3-3 was first described as an abundant acidic protein in brain composing ∼1% of the total soluble protein (19Moore B.W. Perez V.J. Gehring M. J. Neurochem. 1968; 15: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has been repeatedly rediscovered under many guises, including as an activator of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases (20Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Araki K. Kuwano R.

Genetic knock-out of 14-3-3 in Drosophila causes a profound disruption of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (26Broadie K. Rushton E. Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1997; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Exogenous 14-3-3 has been reported to enhance catecholamine secretion in chromaffin cells (27Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Nature. 1992; 355: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A common theme in diverse studies is that 14-3-3 functions through its ability to bind specific phosphoserine sites. Two consensus 14-3-3 binding motifs have been identified, RSXpSXP and RX(Y/F)XpSXP (pS represent the phosphorylated serine residue) (28Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A.

In addition, 14-3-3 binds to other phosphorylated sites (25Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar), to unphosphorylated acidic motifs, and to the cysteine-rich domain of Raf. 14-3-3 family members act as chaperones, scaffolds, or adaptor proteins (25Fu H.

Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screen—Residues 28–399 of Rim1 (pGBKT7-Rim1 (28–399)) was constructed in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of bait vector pGBKT7 (Matchmaker Gal4 Two-Hybrid System 3, Clontech). Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out according to the standard protocol of this system by using a rat brain cDNA library (Clontech). Approximately 2 × 106 yeast cells were screened, and positive clones were selected for their ability to grow on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine hemisulfate salt and assayed for α-galactosidase activity on media supplemented with X-α-gal (Clontech). Prey DNA was amplified from the positive clones by using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and sequenced. Antibodies—14-3-3 antibody (sc-629), c-Myc (9E10) agarose conjugate (sc-40AC), and hemagglutinin (HA) probe (F-7) agarose conjugate (sc-7392AC) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. HA antibody (12CA5) was obtained from BABCO (Berkeley Antibody Company). c-Myc antibody (9E10) was obtained from Clontech.

Serine-to-alanine mutants for HA-tagged Rim1(1–399), Rim2(1–396) and Rabphilin3(1–286) were generated using the QuickChange Site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutation sites were: 1) Rim1, Ser-241 to Ala, Ser-287 to Ala, Ser-379 to Ala, Ser-241/Ser-287 to Ala-241/Ala-287; 2) Rim2, Ser-238 to Ala, Ser-335 to Ala, Ser-238/Ser-335 to Ala-238/Ala-335; and 3) Rabphilin3, Ser-234 to Ala, Ser-274 to Ala. The specific base changes in all mutants were confirmed by sequence analysis. cDNA fragment encoding the entire η-14-3-3 protein was amplified from yeast-prey DNA and subcloned into pCMV-Myc and pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Protein Expression and in Vitro Binding Assays—GST-14-3-3 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli HB101 cells by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside induction. Bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) for1hat4 °Cand washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. HEK 293 cells in 35-mm dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish) were transfected with HA-tagged Rim1, Rim2, and Rabphilin3 using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 600 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Cell lysates were spun at 100,000 × g for 15 min to remove debris. Supernatants were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of GST-14-3-3 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed twice in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and once in the same buffer minus detergent. Proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the 12CA5 anti-HA1 antibody (1:2000 dilution). HA-tagged Rim or Rabphilin3 were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Assays—Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 600 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Immunoprecipitation assays were performed by incubating cell lysates with HA-probe agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with cold lysis buffer before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. Phosphatase Treatment—2 × 106 cells transfected with HA-tagged Rim or Rabphilin3 constructs were lysed in 600 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer lacking sodium vanadate. One-fourth to one-half of the lysates was adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/μl of aprotinin, 10 μg/μl of leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. Alkaline phosphatase (Roche) was added to a final concentration of 100 units/ml, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (Rim1) or 1 h (Rim2). After phosphatase treatment, the samples were placed on ice and incubated with GST-14-3-3 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Cell lysates without alkaline phosphatase treatment were used as positive control. Ca2 +/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Phosphorylation—GST-Rim1-(1–399) or GST-Rim1(1–399)S241/287A fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. In vitro phosphorylation with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). GST-Rim1(1–399) or GST-Rim1(1–399)S241/287A (2.5–20 μg of protein) bound to beads was incubated with 20 units/μl of CaMKII (preactivated by autophosphorylation with ATP/Mg2+ in the presence of CaCl2 and calmodulin) in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA for 30 min at 30 °C. Beads were washed and then incubated with Myc-14-3-3-transfected HEK293 cell lysates (in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the anti-Myc antibody (1:1000 dilution) and a secondary antibody for enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cross-linking Experiments—HEK293 cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged pCMVneo, Rim1(1–399), Rim1(1–399)S241/287A, and Myc-tagged 14-3-3. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C in either the absence or presence of a non-cleavable cross-linker, disuccinimidyl suberate (1 mm, Pierce Biotechnology). After quenching with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), cells were lysed in Triton X-100 buffer, and cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc conjugated beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Chromaffin Cell Preparation, Transfection, and Secretion Experiments—Chromaffin cell preparation, transient transfection, and secretion experiments were performed as described previously (30Holz R.W.

Housley P.R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 226: 212-220Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in 12-well plates (22.6-mm well diameter). Secretion experiments were performed 4–5 days after transfection at 30 °C in a physiological salt solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mm ascorbate. Permeabilized cell experiments were performed in potassium glutamate solution (KGEP) containing 139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.6), 2 mm ATP/Mg2+, and 5mm EGTA with or without 30 μm Ca2+ (33Dunn L.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4989-4993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human growth hormone (hGH) was measured with a high-sensitivity chemiluminescence assay from Nichols Institute (San Juan Capistrano, CA). Endogenous catecholamine secretion was measured with a fluorescence assay. Stimulated release was calculated as the fraction of total of hGH or catecholamine released into the incubation medium. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. There was usually 0.5–1.0 ng of hGH and 30–60 nmol of catecholamine/22.6-mm diameter well. 14-3-3 Interacts with the N-terminal Rim1 in a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—N-terminal Rim1(28–399), including the zinc finger and the high-charged region, was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. It was selected because it includes the zinc finger that alone enhances secretion as well as nearby domains that could modulate zinc finger function. It did not include the domain that is required for Rab3a binding to avoid colonies expressing Rab proteins. Rim1(28–399) was well expressed in lysates from yeast transformed with the plasmid encoding the bait (pGBKRim1 (28–399)) (data not shown). A rat brain cDNA prey library was used to transform the bait-expressing yeast cells. Approximately 2 × 106 transformants were screened, and a total of 50 positive prey clones were isolated and sequenced. Twenty-two of the clones encoded four types of 14-3-3 isoforms, η, β, γ, and δ. These clones contained slightly different cDNA sizes, but all had the full-length cDNA of 14-3-3. Because 14-3-3η was the most frequent isoform, it was chosen for further characterization. 14-3-3 Directly Interacts with the High-charged Region of Rim—To investigate the in vitro interaction between 14-3-3 and N-terminal Rim1, HEK293 cells that had been transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged Rim1 constructs were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-14-3-3 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins bound to the beads were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the bound HA-tagged Rim1 was detected with anti-HA antibody. The experiments confirmed the interaction identified in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1A). Protein 14-3-3 attached to beads pulled down full-length Rim1(1–1553) and N-terminal constructs, Rim1(1–399) and Rim1(28–399). These constructs contained the zinc finger and the high-charged region (Fig. 1B). The high-charged region alone (Rim1(226–399)) also bound 14-3-3, whereas a construct containing the zinc finger region without the high-charged region (Rim1(1–214)) did not, indicating that the high-charged region is responsible for the interaction between 14-3-3 and Rim1. Rim2 is a ubiquitously expressed homolog of the neuronal Rim1 (7Wang Y. Sugita S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Rim2 construct, Rim2(1–396), also bound 14-3-3 (Fig. 1A). To further characterize the 14-3-3/Rim1 interaction, we investigated the ability of various concentrations of purified recombinant 14-3-3 protein (without GST) to bind HA-Rim(1–399). HA-Rim1(1–399) in lysates was bound to anti-HA-agarose beads and then incubated with the indicated concentrations of 14-3-3. After incubation, beads were washed and probed for 14-3-3. A dose-dependent binding of 14-3-3 protein was observed (Fig. 2) with half-maximal 14-3-3 binding at 0.1 μm and saturated binding at 1–3 μm. Rim Interaction with 14-3-3 Requires Rim Phosphorylation— The interaction of 14-3-3 with target proteins is often mediated by the recognition of a phosphoserine found in a consensus binding motif (see the “Introduction”). To determine whether phosphorylated residues are involved in the Rim interaction with 14-3-3, lysates from HEK293 cells transiently expressing various Rim constructs were treated with alkaline phosphatase and then incubated with GST-14-3-3 bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The association of Rim with GST-14-3-3 was detected by immunoblotting. Phosphatase treatment greatly reduced the association of both Rim1 and Rim2 with 14-3-3 (Fig. 3A). The decrease in association was not attributable to loss of Rim1 or Rim2 during the incubations, because equivalent amounts of Rim proteins were present in the samples after phosphatase treatment (Fig. 3A, bottom). The experiments revealed two differences between the interaction of Rim1 and Rim2 with 14-3-3. First, whereas the interaction of Rim1 with 14-3-3 remained stable during the 4-h incubation at 37 °C in the absence of phosphatase, the association of Rim2 with 14-3-3 was greatly reduced after a 1-h incubation at 37 °C (in the absence of phosphatase) compared with the samples left on ice (Fig. 3A). Second, the binding of Rim2(1–396) to GST-14-3-3 was reversible during extensive washing in contrast to the stable binding of Rim1(1–399) to GST-14-3-3 (Fig. 3B). The stronger binding to Rim1 may reflect the presence of two critical phosphorylated 14-3-3-binding domains in Rim1 and only one in Rim2 (see below). Effects of the Ser → Ala Mutations in Rim on Interaction with 14-3-3—The high-charged region of Rim1 (Rim1(226–399)) alone bound 14-3-3 (Fig. 1A). It contains two sites, RSRS287EP and RYRS379DP, that correspond to the consensus 14-3-3 binding motifs, RSXpSXP and RX(Y/F)XpSXP (28Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar) (pS denotes the phosphorylated Ser). To determine whether phosphorylated Ser-287 and Ser-379 are important for Rim1 binding to 14-3-3, immunoprecipitation assays were performed comparing the ability of wt Rim1(1–399) and mutant Rim1(1–399) (Rim1(1–399)S287A, Rim1(1–399)S379A) to interact with endogenous 14-3-3 (Fig. 4A). The S287A but not the S379A mutation reduced the Rim1–14-3-3 interaction. 14-3-3 exists as a dimer and can act as a bidentate ligand. To locate another 14-3-3 binding site in the high-charged region, three more Ser → Ala mutations were tested (Rim1(1–399)S241A, Rim1(1–399)-S310A, and Rim(1–399)S350A). The S241A mutation reduced the Rim1–14-3-3 interaction (Fig. 4A), whereas the S310A and S350A mutations had no effects (data not shown). RSRS241QTP is similar to the consensus 14-3-3 binding motif. The double mutant, Rim1(1–399)S241/287A, had greatly reduced ability to bind 14-3-3 (Fig. 4A), indicating that 14-3-3 interacts with N-terminal Rim1 through two phosphorylated serines, Ser-241 and Ser-287. The very small amount of binding that was detected with the double mutant (Figs. 5 and 6) may reflect nonspecific binding and/or the limited ability of 14-3-3 to interact with another domain (e.g. the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain as demonstrated with Raf (22Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2088884965,"Electron paramagnetic resonance and kinetics experiments have been made to determine the formation, stability, and fate of the natural nitric oxide carrier, dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex (DNDGIC), in heterogeneous systems approaching in vivo conditions. Both in human placenta and rat liver homogenates DNDGIC is formed spontaneously from GSH, S-nitroso-glutathione, and trace amounts of ferrous ions. DNDGIC is unstable in homogenates depleted of glutathione S-transferase (GST); an initial phase of rapid decomposition is followed by a slower decay, which is inversely proportional to the concentration. In the crude human placenta homogenate, GSTP1-1, which represents 90% of the cytosolic GST isoenzymes, is the preferential target for DNDGIC. It binds the complex almost stoichiometrically and stabilizes it for several hours (t 1/2 = 8 h). In the presence of an excess of DNDGIC, negative cooperativity in GSTP1-1 opposes the complete loss of the usual detoxicating activity of this enzyme. In the rat liver homogenate, multiple endogenous GSTs (mainly Alpha and Mu class isoenzymes) bind the complex quantitatively and stabilize it (t 1/2 = 4.5 h); negative cooperativity is also seen for these GSTs. Thus, the entire pool of cytosolic GSTs, with the exception of the Theta GST, represents a target for stoichiometric amounts of DNDGIC and may act as storage proteins for nitric oxide. These results confirm the existence of a cross-link between NO metabolism and the GST superfamily.

These results confirm the existence of a cross-link between NO metabolism and the GST superfamily. A crucial step in biochemical research is the demonstration that a specific phenomenon observed in vitro may actually occur in vivo. In the accompanying paper (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) we have characterized the peculiar interaction in vitro of an endogenous NO carrier, the dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex (DNDGIC), 1The abbreviations used are: DNDGIC, dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CDNB, 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene.1The abbreviations used are: DNDGIC, dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CDNB, 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene. with representative members of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily. In this paper we extend these studies in order to verify the occurrence and the modality of this interaction in complex biological systems like crude tissue homogenates. The aim of the present paper is also to determine whether DNDGIC could be formed in multicomponent biological systems starting from GSNO, GSH, and trace amounts of ferrous ions. Although a homogenate is not representative of the environment found in the living cell, the use of homogenates allows direct measurements of GST activity, which at present cannot be determined in intact cells. A useful model for this investigation is the human placenta tissue which mainly expresses GSTP1-1, and the rat liver which represents a more complex system containing many different GST isoenzymes (2Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.-F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that DNDGIC can be readily formed in homogenates and that GSTP1-1 is the main target of DNDGIC in the human placenta, whereas the entire pool of GSTs (mainly Alpha and Mu class GSTs) plays a similar role in rat liver. DNDGIC is greatly stabilized when bound to GSTs, and these enzymes may act as half-storage proteins for NO taking advantage of a common negative cooperativity induced by DNDGIC binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNDGIC Synthesis—DNDGIC was prepared essentially as described previously (3Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of 0.5 mm FeSO4 (dissolved in degassed water to avoid rapid oxidation to ferric state) was incubated in 10 ml (final volume) of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm GSH and 2 mm GSNO (25 °C). After 10 min, the reaction was almost complete, and the resulting stock solution of DNDGIC (50 μm) was stable at least for 3 h.The stability of DNDGIC in a simple buffer or in homogenates was assayed in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. EDTA prevents the metal-catalyzed release of NO from GSNO (4Sing R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalynaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18596-18603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and thus the possible DNDGIC re-synthesis in the presence of an excess of GSH and GSNO. On the other hand 10 mm EDTA is unable to abstract ferrous ions from DNDGIC (data not shown).EPR Detection of DNDGIC—Samples for EPR experiments were usually prepared using tissue homogenates or 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with DNDGIC added from a freshly made stock solution. EPR measurements were carried out at room temperature (22-25 °C) with a Bruker ESP300 X-band instrument (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a high sensitivity TM110-mode cavity. To optimize instrument sensitivity, spectra were recorded using samples of 80 μl contained in flat glass capillaries (inner cross-section 5 × 0.3 mm) (5Pedersen J.Z. Cox R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 369-371Google Scholar). For kinetics measurements standard round glass capillaries (1.10 mm inner diameter) with a working volume of 40 μl were applied, to allow rapid handling of samples. Unless otherwise stated, spectra were measured over a 200-G range using 20 milliwatts power, 2.0 G modulation, and a scan time of 42 s; typically 4-40 single scans were accumulated to improve the signal to noise ratio. High resolution spectra were recorded with 0.1 G modulation and 2 milliwatts power. Quantitation of DNDGIC has been done by incubating GSH (20 mm) and GSNO (2 mm) with variable amounts of ferrous ions (from 2 μm to 20 μm) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence or absence of crude homogenates.GST Activity—GST activity was assayed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, in the presence of 10 mm GSH and 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (25 °C). The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm where the GSH-2,4-dinitrobenzene adduct absorbs (ϵ = 9,600 m-1 cm-1).Detection of DNDGIC by GSTA1-1 Inhibition—Variable amounts of DNDGIC (from 0.2 to 2 μm) were incubated at 25 °C with 4 μm GSTA1-1 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 10 mm EDTA. After 5 min, 10-μl aliquots were assayed for enzymatic activity with 10 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Spectrophotometric determinations at 340 nm started within 10 s from addition of the substrates. A strict linearity of inhibition was observed within a complex:enzyme ratio between 0.05 and 0.5 (see Fig. 1).Preparation of Crude Homogenates—Crude human placenta (20 g) was cut in small pieces and washed 5 times with 200 ml of physiological solution. The washed tissue was then homogenized in a Waring blender with 20 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant, containing 2-3 μm of GSTP1-1, was termed “crude human placenta homogenate.”Rat liver crude homogenate was prepared starting from 10 g of Sprague-Dawley female rat liver washed 2-fold with 200 ml of physiological solution. The tissue was homogenized with 30 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g (15 min), the resulting supernatant, termed “crude rat liver homogenate,” contained the entire pool of GST isoenzymes corresponding to about 56 μm GST.Preparation of GST-depleted Homogenates—GST-depleted homogenates were obtained using affinity chromatography on immobilized GSH (6Simmons P.C. Vander Jagt D.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). 10 ml of crude human placenta homogenate was passed through a column (1 × 4 cm) of glutathione-Sepharose matrix. This single step procedure of affinity chromatography allowed us to retain on the column more than 95% of the transferase activity, and the resulting eluate was termed “GST-depleted placenta homogenate.” An identical procedure was made for the rat liver homogenate, with the exception that the first eluate was again passed 2 times through the same column. This procedure was necessary to retain quantitatively the Alpha class GSTs that showed limited affinity for this specific matrix. The final eluate was termed “GST-depleted liver homogenate,” although it contains a small amount of endogenous Theta class GST which is not retained by this specific column. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (7Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall. R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSDNDGIC Formation in GST-depleted Human Placenta Homogenate—DNDGIC is readily formed in vitro starting from GSH, GSNO, and trace amounts of ferrous ions (3Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The reaction probably occurs after release of nitric oxide through an iron-mediated reaction between GSNO and GSH. The effects of heterogeneous biological systems on the formation and stability of DNDGIC have been evaluated by reacting these natural compounds in human placenta homogenates. DNDGIC may be monitored through the typical EPR spectrum of this complex which shows a characteristic shape with a maximum at g = 2.03 (Fig. 1a). The detection limit of this procedure is about 1 μm concentration for EPR analysis performed at 25 °C. Alternatively, a more sensitive procedure has been used based on the strong competitive inhibition of GSTA1-1 by DNDGIC (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). (Fig. 1b). Human placenta represents a peculiar tissue as it contains mainly a single isoenzyme, GSTP1-1, which accounts for more than 90% of all cytosolic GSTs. In a first experimental approach, a GST-depleted homogenate was employed to avoid any possible influence of GSTP1-1 on the formation and stability of DNDGIC. In this milieu, after incubation of 20 mm GSH, 2 mm GSNO, and 10 μm ferrous sulfate, the complex was quantitatively formed within 10 min (half-time of formation = 2.7 min), and apparently, it was stable for at least 1 h (Fig. 2a). This finding was not obvious as a lot of endogenous compounds could sequester or oxidize ferrous ions. The synthesis of DNDGIC proceeds about 10 times slower than in a simple buffer (Fig. 2a), suggesting that unknown components of the homogenate bind or oxidize reversibly the exogenous ferrous ions. The apparent stability of DNDGIC in the presence of an excess of GSH and GSNO both in solution and in the GST-depleted homogenate is probably the consequence of a steady-state condition, by which the decomposition of the complex is balanced by re-synthesis from the excess of reagents. In fact, when authentic DNDGIC is incubated in a simple buffer, it is unstable and decomposes at increasing rates when the complex concentration is lowered (Fig. 2d). The kinetics are complicated, showing an initial fast phase which is mainly evident at low concentrations, followed by a second phase of slower decay. At 2, 5, and 10 μm DNDGIC concentrations, the overall t 1/2 values are 12, 17, and 21 min, respectively. In the placental GST-depleted homogenate, a more prominent fast decomposition is observed at the lowest concentrations, whereas the second phase is similar to that observed in the simple buffer (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, EPR analysis, performed under specific conditions where free and bound complexes can easily be distinguished (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L.

For comparison, the spectrum of an identical amount of DNDGIC after reaction with 10 μm of purified GSTP1-1 in a simple buffer is reported (spectrum 2). The g values are given in the Table II of the accompanying paper (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol.

Spectrum 3 shows free DNDGIC (10 μm) after 10 min of incubation in GST-depleted placenta homogenate; the low intensity broad component centered around the residual main signal was attributed to an unknown paramagnetic species. b, DNDGIC (1 μm) was incubated in human placenta homogenate containing 2 μm GST P1-1 and 10 mm EDTA. The stability of DNDGIC was assayed on the basis of the inhibition on GSTP1-1 activity (□). The apparent t 1/2 value is 8 h.

As shown in Fig. 3a, GSTP1-1 undergoes a time-dependent and iron-dependent loss of activity. The inhibition does not occur in the presence of 1 mm EDTA and is reversed by addition of 10 mm KCN, confirming that it is really caused by DNDGIC binding (3Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizio F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of 20 mm GSH, which competes with DNDGIC for the same G-site, a significant inhibition is observed even when the added iron is stoichiometric to the enzyme (2 μm), indicating that DNDGIC is quantitatively formed at these very low concentrations and that it binds strongly to GSTP1-1. In addition, loss of activity does not exceed 50% of the original activity even at an enzyme: iron ratio of about 1:20, a behavior that corresponds to the biphasic inhibition pattern observed for the DNDGIC-GSTP1-1 interaction (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol.

Interestingly, a slower inhibition of about 30% of the original activity was also observed in the absence of added iron. This is most likely due to DNDGIC being formed from the constitutive free iron of the homogenate or to mobilization of iron from endogenous sources.Fig. 3Interaction of DNDGIC with GSTP1-1 in crude human placenta homogenate. a, 20 mm GSH and 2 mm GSNO were incubated with variable amounts of ferrous sulfate (from 2 to 20 μm) in 1 ml of crude human placenta homogenate containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The endogenous GSTP1-1 was 2 μm. At fixed times, the residual GST activity was assayed on 10-μl aliquots diluted in 1 ml of 0.1 m of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB. ▪, no FeSO4 added; □, 2 μm FeSO4; ♦, 10 μm FeSO4; •, 20 μm FeSO4 . b, variable amounts of authentic DNDGIC (from 0.1 to 20 μm) were incubated in 1 ml of crude human placenta homogenate containing 2 μm GSTP1-1 and 10 mm EDTA (▪). At fixed times 10-μl aliquots were assayed for activity determination after dilution in 1 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB. The same experiment with 2 μm GSTP1-1 in the absence of homogenate is also reported (•).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A more accurate determination of the modality and stoichiometry of this interaction has been obtained by direct incubation of variable amounts of authentic DNDGIC (from 0.1 to 20 μm) in the crude placenta homogenate that contains 2 μm of endogenous GSTP1-1. The extent of the transferase inhibition reflects a 1:1 complex-enzyme interaction (Fig. 3b) up to 50% of residual activity. The inhibition behavior parallels that found when GSTP1-1 and DNDGIC were incubated in a simple buffer (Fig. 3b), providing strong evidence that in the homogenate GSTP1-1 is the primary target for DNDGIC despite the presence of thousands of different low molecular mass compounds and proteins. We must emphasize that these inhibition data are obtained using the assay procedure “under non-equilibrium conditions” which gives a snapshot of the binding situation as it occurs in the homogenate mixture and not in the final activity solution (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Increasing the DNDGIC concentrations over a 10 times excess leads to further inhibition due to binding of the complex also to the second subunit, thus confirming the presence of a negative cooperativity that lowers the affinity of the second G-site. By using the activity assay procedure under equilibrium conditions and taking into account that DNDGIC is a competitive inhibitor toward GSH, K D values of 10-9 and 7 × 10-8m have been calculated for the high affinity and low affinity G-sites, respectively (experiment not shown), close to those calculated for the purified enzyme (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). EPR spectra, recorded after the incubation of DNDGIC in the placental homogenate, confirm the appearance of a protein-bound paramagnetic species very similar to that obtained in a purified system after binding of DNDGIC to GSTP1-1 (Fig. 4a). Note that in this experiment, the GST concentration has been increased artifactually from 2 to 8 μm to obtain sufficiently good EPR spectra to allow comparison.GSTP1-1 Stabilizes DNDGIC in the Placenta Homogenate—The stability of DNDGIC bound to GSTP1-1 has been determined by using the EPR spectroscopy and, alternatively, by measuring the extent of the GSTP1-1 inhibition in the homogenate due to DNDGIC. As shown in Fig. 4b, both these analytical approaches indicate a dramatic stabilization of this complex when it interacts with the G-site. A half-life of about 480 min has been calculated at a concentration of 2 μm of DNDGIC which must be compared with that found in the GST-depleted homogenate (t 1/2 = 2.8 min) (Fig. 4b) and also to that calculated in the sample buffer (t 1/2 = 12 min).Formation and Instability of DNDGIC in GST-depleted Rat Liver Homogenate—The rat liver homogenate is a second model used to check both formation and stability of DNDGIC in heterogeneous systems. In this context, rat liver is a more complex tissue than human placenta as it contains at least 14 GST isoenzymes belonging to the Alpha, Pi, Mu, and Theta classes (2Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.-F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) which account for 3-5% of the cytosolic proteins. In this case, the use of a GST-depleted homogenate is a useful tool to evaluate the net influence of the entire pool of the endogenous GSTs on the formation and stability of the complex. In this GST-depleted system, DNDGIC is quantitatively formed starting from 20 mm GSH, 2 mm GSNO, and 10 μm ferrous ions. The kinetics of formation and apparent stability are similar to that observed in the placenta homogenate (data not shown). Incubation of authentic DNDGIC in the GST-depleted rat liver homogenate results in a fast degradation of the complex (Fig. 2c). The kinetics of decomposition show first a very fast and concentration-independent phase that causes the disappearance of about 20-25% of DNDGIC in a few seconds. In a second step, a slower degradation occurs that is concentration-dependent. The Theta class GST, present in the depleted homogenate, represents only 0.02% of the soluble liver protein (8Meyer D.J. Coles B. Pemble S.E. Gilmore K.S. Fraser G.M. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and therefore a small amount (about 0.5 μm) when compared with the final concentration of DNDGIC used in these experiments (from 2 to 10 μm).Alpha and Mu Class GSTs Are the Primary Targets for DNDGIC in the Rat Liver Homogenate—The female rat liver used in our experiments expresses multiple GST isoenzymes, but the Alpha class and Mu class GSTs are prevalently represented (56 and 43%, respectively) (2Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.-F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas GSTP1-1 is less than 1%. Even the Theta class GST does not exceed the 1% of all GSTs (8Meyer D.J. Coles B. Pemble S.E. Gilmore K.S. Fraser G.M. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Specific activities and the relative concentrations of all cytosolic rat liver GSTs have been determined previously (9Adang A.E.P. Brussee J. van der Gen A. Mulder G.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), so a quantitative evaluation of the interaction of DNDGIC with endogenous GSTs can be made despite the high complexity of this system. When GSH (20 mm) and GSNO (2 mm) were incubated in the presence of variable amounts of ferrous ions in the crude rat liver homogenate, a time-dependent inhibition occurs, which can be reversed completely by 10 mm KCN. The activity decreases to about 30% of the original level at about 3-4 m excesses of ferrous ions over GSTs (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, in the absence of exogenous iron, a slower inhibition to about 60% of residual activity also occurs, likely due to DNDGIC formed by the constitutive free iron of the homogenate. A more detailed analysis has been obtained by incubating authentic DNDGIC in the same crude rat liver homogenate (Fig. 5b). The inhibition pattern displays an evident biphasic behavior similar to that found in the placenta homogenate, although many different GSTs isoenzymes are present in this system. The first phase ends at about 25% of the original activity when the added DNDGIC is stoichiometric to all GSTs. The second step of inhibition is seen only when the complex:GST ratio exceeds 30 (not shown). In vitro GSTA1-1, differently from GSTM2-2 and GSTP1-1, is almost inactive already when DNDGIC is bound to only one subunit of this dimeric enzyme (1De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the Alpha class GSTs in rat liver account for about 40% of the total transferase activity, a residual activity of about 30% is expected when DNDGIC half-saturates all endogenous GSTs. This theoretical value agrees well to that found in our experiments. These conclusions have been confirmed by EPR experiments. After incubation of DNDGIC (half-stoichiometric to all endogenous GSTs) in the crude rat liver homogenate, no free complex was detected. The EPR spectrum reported in Fig. 6a does not correspond to either DNDGIC-GSTA1-1 or DNDGIC-GSTM2-2, but it is compatible with the sum of two different paramagnetic species corresponding to the DNDGIC-GSTA1-1 and DNDGIC-GSTM2-2 complexes in a ratio of 56:43; this ratio reflects their relative abundance in the tissue.Fig. 5Interaction of DNDGIC with the pool of GSTs in crude rat liver homogenate. a, 20 mm GSH and 2 mm GSNO were incubated with variable amounts of ferrous sulfate (from 20 to 100 μm) in 1 ml of crude rat liver homogenate containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.

N-WASP localizes at the cell periphery, where it controls actin polymerization downstream of signal molecules such as adapter proteins, Cdc42, Src family kinases, and phosphoinositides. N-WASP also localizes in the nucleus; however, the role of N-WASP in the nucleus is unclear. Here, we show that localization of N-WASP is controlled through phosphorylation by Src family kinases in which phosphorylated N-WASP is exported from the nucleus in a nuclear export signal (NES) and leptomycin B-dependent manner. N-WASP had nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its basic region and NES close to the phosphorylation site by Src family kinases, indicating that phosphorylation controls the accessibility to the NES through conformational changes. Increased levels of unphosphorylated N-WASP in the nucleus suppressed expression of HSP90 and transcription from a heat shock element (HSE). N-WASP bound heat shock transcription factor (HSTF) and enhanced the HSTF association with HSE. In addition, nuclear N-WASP was present in the protein complex that associates with HSE, suggesting that N-WASP participates in suppression of HSP90 transcription. Increased levels of unphosphorylated N-WASP also decreased the activities of Src family kinases in cells but not in experiments in vitro with pure N-WASP and Fyn.

The VCA (verprolin-homology, cofilin-homology, and acidic) domain of N-WASP and WASP not only associates with actin and Arp2/3 complex but also with the middle region of N-WASP or WASP, by intramolecular interactions. It has been postulated that the association between the VCA region and the middle region of N-WASP yields an autoinhibited structure (10Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T.

Upon association with Cdc42 and/or phosphoinositides or phosphorylation of N-WASP by Src family kinases, the autoinhibition of N-WASP is released. However, the relation between N-WASP conformation and localization is not clear. Src family kinases have roles in controlling the actin cytoskeleton, but they also promote proliferation of cells. Therefore, mutations that activate Src family kinases induce transformation of cells. The activity of Src family kinases is controlled in a variety of ways, including phosphorylation, dephosphorylation (14Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 15Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by proteasomes (16Harris K.F. Shoji I. Cooper E.M. Kumar S. Oda H. Howley P.M. Proc.

Molecular chaperones, such as HSP90, also play the important roles in proper activation of Src family kinases. Loss of HSP90 activity due to a specific inhibitor of HSP90, geldanamycin, results in the loss of Src family kinase activity. Src and HSP90 form a complex that promotes transformation of cells (19Uehara Y. Hori M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 2198-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 20Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of N-WASP in the nucleus. Localization of N-WASP is affected by its phosphorylation by Src family kinases (21Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated N-WASP tends to localize in the cytoplasm, whereas unphosphorylated N-WASP localizes predominantly in the nucleus. Comparison of the amounts of transcripts from cells expressing an N-WASP mutant lacking a phosphorylation site and those from cells expressing a phosphorylation-mimic mutant of N-WASP revealed that N-WASP is involved in transcription of HSP90. Analysis of several cell lines expressing mutant N-WASP and transcription from a heat shock element (HSE) suggest that N-WASP is a negative regulator of HSP90 expression. This effect of N-WASP appears to be inhibited when N-WASP is phosphorylated and exported from the nucleus. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were cultured as described previously (22Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Transfection was done with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instructions. Localization of N-WASP was analyzed by GFP fluorescence or indirect immunofluorescence with anti-N-WASP antibody. Heat shock was performed at 44°C for 30 min followed by the recovery of cells at 37°C for 90 min. Tet-off HEK293 cells were purchased from Clontech. The stably transfected HEK293 cell lines were established according to the manufacturer's instruction. Doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was used as an alternative to tetracycline to suppress transgene expression. DNA Microarray—HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP-Y253F N-WASP or GFP-Y253E N-WASP. About 10 μg of plasmid was introduced by electroporation (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were harvested, and mRNA was purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) followed by the Quickprep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). After checking the quality of mRNA by electrophoresis, Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were generated with a Fluorescence Labeling core kit (Takara). The qualities of these probes for hybridization on microarrays were confirmed with Test Array (Takara). The probes were then hybridized on IntelliGene Human CHIP 1K Set I version 1.0 (Takara). Microarray signals were acquired with Scan Array Lite (Packard BioChip Technologies). Signals were calibrated to housekeeping genes spotted on the chip (see “DNA Microassay Analysis of Cells Expressing Y253F N-WASP or Y253E N-WASP”). Spots with signal intensities more than twice the level of the standard deviation of background signal were selected for further analysis (23Phimister B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Statistical significance of expressional changes was determined by using Student's t test of signal intensities against standard genes (p < 0.05). Luciferase Assay—The sequence from the promoter region of HSP89alpha (HSP90alpha) with heat shock element (HSE) and TATA box was cloned into pGL-basic vector (Promega).

After co-transfection of plasmids for N-WASP expression and HSE reporter plasmids at a ratio of 3:1, cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined with a Luciferase Assay kit (Stratagene). The luciferase activity was normalized to the total amount of protein determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins—Full-length or truncated (1-204 amino acids) human heat-shock transcription factor/heat-shock factor 1 (HSTF1) was subcloned into pGEX (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene), purified, and the GST tag was removed as described previously (22Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Fyn and N-WASP were obtained as described previously (21Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Gel-mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear fractions for gel shift assays was prepared as described previously (24Fukami K. Takenaka K. Nagano K. Takenawa T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The sequence of the probe was the same as that used in luciferase reporter plasmid. Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assay with purified Fyn, N-WASP, and/or poly-Glu:Tyr 4:1 substrate (Sigma) was performed as follows. Proteins were purified as described previously (21Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Fyn (final 0.1 μg/μl) and N-WASP (final 1 μg/μl) was mixed with poly-Glu:Tyr (4:1) (Sigma) (final 0.4 μg/μl) in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm ATP with 20 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30°C. Addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling stopped the reaction. Phosphorylation was monitored by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For kinase assays with Fyn immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells, wild-type Fyn and GFP-tagged wild-type N-WASP, Y253F N-WASP, or Y253E N-WASP were co-transfected and cultured in medium containing serum for 1 day. Cells were then serum-starved for overnight and harvested into buffer containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin. After immunoprecipitation with anti-Fyn monoclonal antibody (generous gift of Drs. Tezuka and Yamamoto, University of Tokyo), the kinase reaction was performed with 0.2 μg/μl poly-Glu:Tyr in the kinase buffer. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30°C. Addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling stopped the reaction. Phosphorylation was monitored by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Focus Assay—NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells (1.8 × 105) were seeded into a 6-cm dish. After overnight culture, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid expressing constitutively active (CA) Y531F Fyn or dominant negative (DN) K299M Fyn and 2 μg of plasmid expressing GFP-tagged wild-type N-WASP, Y253F N-WASP, or Y253E N-WASP. The following day, the cells were divided into four 6-cm dishes. Cells were then cultured for 2 weeks. Culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Focus formation was analyzed by Giemsa staining (Sigma). Localization of N-WASP Is Determined by Its Phosphorylation Status—We previously reported that phosphorylation of N-WASP by Src family kinases releases the autoinhibited structure and activates the Arp2/3 complex (21Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We made phosphorylation site mutants of N-WASP. In Y253F N-WASP, the tyrosine of the phosphorylation site is replaced with phenylalanine and cannot be phosphorylated. In contrast, Y253E N-WASP has a positively charged glutamic acid instead of tyrosine, mimicking phosphorylation. We examined localization of these N-WASP mutants and of wild-type N-WASP in COS-7 cells with GFP. Wild-type N-WASP was localized in the cytoplasm and in nucleus during serum starvation (Fig. 1, A and B). Both Y253F and Y253E N-WASP localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm; however, the localization patterns were different. Y253F N-WASP was preferentially localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas Y253E N-WASP was preferentially localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and B). We then investigated localization of endogenous N-WASP in the presence of constitutively active (CA) or dominant-negative (DN; kinase-negative) Fyn. Expression of CA Fyn decreased the amount of N-WASP in the nucleus, whereas DN Fyn had no effect on localization of N-WASP (Fig. 1C). To confirm the phosphorylation-dependent localization of N-WASP, we examined the localization of Y253F N-WASP in the presence of CA Fyn. Y253F N-WASP preferentially localized in the nucleus even in the presence of CA Fyn (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of N-WASP influences localization of N-WASP. N-WASP Is Exported from the Nucleus in a Leptomycin B-dependent Manner—Localization of proteins in the nucleus is actively regulated by nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) sequences present in the protein itself. NLS is a basic amino acid sequence that is also in N-WASP. The IQ motif was originally found as calmodulin binding site. But its role in N-WASP function remains unclear. The IQ motif is composed of basic amino acids. Besides IQ motif, N-WASP has another basic amino acid cluster, the basic region (2Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 25Suetsugu S. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Obinata T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4533-4542PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the IQ motif (amino acids 126-145) or both IQ motif and basic region (amino acids 126-194) results in localization of N-WASP predominantly in cytoplasm. These cytoplasmic localizations of N-WASP mutants were observed in 93% of ΔIQ mutant-expressing cells and 95% of Δbasic mutant-expressing cells, indicating that the IQ motif and the basic region are the NLS for N-WASP (Figs. 1A and 2A). In contrast, deletion of the proline-rich region did not affect the nuclear localization of N-WASP. An NES-like sequence with several leucines is also present in N-WASP around the phosphorylation site of N-WASP (Fig. 2A) (26Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism underlying the cytoplasmic localization of N-WASP, we treated cells expressing a GFP fusion Y253E N-WASP with leptomycin B (LMB), which specifically blocks export of proteins with NES from the nucleus within minutes (27Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). LMB treatment of cells resulted in increased Y253E N-WASP levels in the nucleus within 30 min. After 120 min treatment of LMB, cytoplasmic localization of Y253E N-WASP was drastically decreased (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that N-WASP is exported actively from the nucleus by an NES-dependent mechanism to the cytoplasm when phosphorylated. To examine the NES of N-WASP, we substituted leucines (Leu-222, Leu-225, Leu-229, and Leu-232) in the putative NES sequence with alanine (Fig. 2A). The resulting mutant N-WASP with Y253E mutation and NES mutation (Y253E LA N-WASP) predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas Y253E N-WASP preferentially localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, B and C). Therefore, Y253E N-WASP is transported into the nucleus by an NLS-dependent mechanism and is also exported in an NES-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of N-WASP probably releases the autoinhibitory interaction and exposes the NES sequence, resulting in export of N-WASP from the nucleus. DNA Microarray Analysis of Cells Expressing Y253F N-WASP or Y253E N-WASP—We then examined changes in gene expression that accompany changes in nuclear N-WASP level by DNA microarray. To compensate for the effect of increased levels of N-WASP due to ectopic expression, we compared the cells expressing Y253F N-WASP, which was localized preferentially in the nucleus, and cells expressing Y253E N-WASP, which was localized preferentially in the cytoplasm. Weak signals with intensities similar to that of the background were excluded from further analysis. We analyzed ∼180 genes that gave signal intensities more than twice the level of the standard deviation of background signal (Fig. 3 and Table I). The ratios of control gene expression were 0.94 ± 0.07 for β-actin, 1.09 ± 0.15 for ATP synthetase, 0.90 ± 0.03 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.89 ± 0.02 for α-tubulin, and 0.88 ± 0.03 for ribosomal protein S5. Expression of most genes appeared to be elevated in cells with Y253E, but these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05 by t test) (Fig. 3). Some genes showed statistically higher expression in cells expressing Y253E N-WASP than in cells expressing Y253F N-WASP (p < 0.05). Genes with elevated expression included HSP90 with a ratio of 1.9 ± 0.3, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule with 2.6 ± 0.3, ATP-binding cassette, sub-family E with 2.2 ± 0.2, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U with 2.6 ± 0.02, human clone 23722 mRNA sequence with 1.9 ± 0.03, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase type IVA with 2.0 ± 0.1 (Table I).Table IList of genes analyzed on DNA

https://openalex.org/W2086427747,"Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a 25-amino acid cytokine found in lepidopteran insects that possesses diverse biological activities such as stimulation of immune cells (plasmatocytes), cell proliferation, and larval growth regulation. We found another novel function of GBP that induces a hemolysis of another class of blood cells (oenocytoids). In the lysate of oenocytoids we identified a GBP-binding protein that shows a specific affinity for GBP. The characterization of purified GBP-binding protein and its cDNA demonstrated it as a 49.5-kDa novel protein with a C-terminal region displaying limited homology to several insect lipoproteins. Results of Northern and Western blotting indicated that the GBP-binding protein should be synthesized only in blood cells. Immunoelectron microscopic analyses confirmed that indirect immunoreactive signals were mostly localized in oenocytoids. Kinetic and biological analyses of interaction between GBP and the binding protein showed their strong binding was followed by clearance of GBP from hemolymph, thus indicating that this protein might function as an inhibitory factor against GBP. Based on these results, we propose that insect cytokine GBP shows multifunctions even in cellular immunity: it serves to stimulate immune cells and afterward silences its own action by inducing the binding protein through specific hemolysis. Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a 25-amino acid cytokine found in lepidopteran insects that possesses diverse biological activities such as stimulation of immune cells (plasmatocytes), cell proliferation, and larval growth regulation. We found another novel function of GBP that induces a hemolysis of another class of blood cells (oenocytoids). In the lysate of oenocytoids we identified a GBP-binding protein that shows a specific affinity for GBP. The characterization of purified GBP-binding protein and its cDNA demonstrated it as a 49.5-kDa novel protein with a C-terminal region displaying limited homology to several insect lipoproteins. Results of Northern and Western blotting indicated that the GBP-binding protein should be synthesized only in blood cells. Immunoelectron microscopic analyses confirmed that indirect immunoreactive signals were mostly localized in oenocytoids. Kinetic and biological analyses of interaction between GBP and the binding protein showed their strong binding was followed by clearance of GBP from hemolymph, thus indicating that this protein might function as an inhibitory factor against GBP. Based on these results, we propose that insect cytokine GBP shows multifunctions even in cellular immunity: it serves to stimulate immune cells and afterward silences its own action by inducing the binding protein through specific hemolysis. Cytokines found in mammals are of central importance in the regulation of many physiological events such as immunity, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and embryonic development. They comprise a group of low molecular weight proteins that are produced by a variety of cell types and generally act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion. In insects, however, no cytokines had been identified until quite recently. The first family of cytokines identified in insects is now referred to as the ENF peptides, which is based on their consensus amino-terminal sequence, Glu-Asn-Phe (1Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Approximately 16 members now belong to the ENF family of peptides; their functions are diverse: insect growth regulator and cell mitogen (growth-blocking peptide, GBP) 1The abbreviations used are: GBP, growth-blocking peptide; GBP-BP, GBP-binding protein; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PP, paralytic peptide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Dopa, 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine.1The abbreviations used are: GBP, growth-blocking peptide; GBP-BP, GBP-binding protein; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PP, paralytic peptide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Dopa, 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine.

Among them, GBP and plasmatocyte-spreading peptide have been shown to exert the multiple biological activities of larval growth retardation, plasmatocyte spreading, and paralysis (1Strand M.R.

In insects, blood cells (hemocytes) play a key role in defense against foreign targets such as pathogens and parasites. Once the invading organism is recognized as foreign, it should be rapidly phagocytosed and/or encapsulated by the circulating hemocytes; small targets are cleared by phagocytosis, whereas larger objects are eliminated by encapsulation (10Rowly A.F. Ratcliffe N.A. Immunology. 1980; 40: 483-492PubMed Google Scholar). A change in the adhesiveness of hemocytes, particularly plasmatocytes, is an important component of the immune responses toward a larger intruder. Attachment of plasmatocytes to a surface and subsequent cellular spreading are essential for the encapsulation process that traps the foreignness inside multicellular capsules (11Strand M.R. Pech L.L. Annu. Rev. Entmol. 1995; 40: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The ENF peptide is the cytokine that can modulate the function of plasmatocytes (1Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y.

Although the cytokine involved in the early immune reactions has been identified, we are still ignorant about the molecular mechanisms controlling the overall process in the cellular immune response. For example, is the effect of the cytokine specific only for early process of the immune reactions? How is the cytokine inactivated after stimulation of plasmatocytes? To address these questions, we focused our attention upon hemocytes to assess their morphological and behavioral changes under the influence of GBP. We found that GBP induced lysis of a particular morphotype of hemocytes, oenocytoids. Further, in the lysate we identified the inhibitory factor against GBP action. Through the characterization of this GBP inhibitory factor, we propose here a novel mechanism by which the action of the insect cytokine is terminated in vivo. Animals—Pseudaletia separata larvae were reared on an artificial diet at 25 ± 1 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h light:8 h dark. Penultimate larvae undergoing ecdysis between 4 and 4.5 h after lights on were designated as day 0 last instar larvae (3Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7982-7984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemocyte Preparation and Assay—Hemocytes were collected from larvae on day 4 of the last instar (sixth instar) according to the method of Pech et al. (15Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Separation of hemocyte morphotypes was performed according to the slightly modified method of Clark et al. (16Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetkiattikul H. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37431-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plasmatocytes and oenocytoids were isolated by loading hemocytes collected from 2–3 larvae onto Percoll gradients from 40 to 60% in Ex-cell 400 medium (JRH Bioscience). Plasmatocytes with an average purity of ∼90% and oenocytoids with a purity of ∼50% were collected from the 45–49% and 52–56% Percoll interface, respectively. Oenocytoids were further purified by Percoll gradients from 0 to 60% in the same medium. By the second density gradient centrifugation, oenocytoids with an average purity of 80–90% were obtained. Phenoloxidase activity in oenocytoid cells was characterized by the method of Rizki and Rizki (17Rizki R.M. Rizki T.M. J. Insect Physiol. 1990; 36: 523-529Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). GBP-induced plasmatocyte-spreading activity was assayed by methods similar to that of Strand et al. (1Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Isolated plasmatocytes were washed twice in Ex-cell 400, then resuspended in the same medium and plated into 96-well culture plates (167008; Nunc). Wells were filled with 100 μl of Ex-cell 400 medium containing 1 × 103 cells/well and 1 nm GBP. The percentage of hemocytes spread in an assay was scored 20 min after adding GBP by counting 100 cells from a randomly selected field by view. Plasmatocytes were scored as spread if they assumed a flattened morphology and were ≥35 μm along their longest axis. Lysis of oenocytoids was observed as follows. Isolated oenocytoids were rinsed twice with 1 ml of Ex-cell 400 medium, and the suspension was then dropped on a glass slide coated with 0.1% poly-lysine. After cells had settled on the surface, GBP (final concentration of 0.1 nm) was added and a cover glass was put on the cells. Morphological changes of oenocytoids were continuously observed with a phase-contrast microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and recorded by a time-lapse video recorder (Victor, Yokohama, Japan). The percentage of oenocytoids lysed during 1 h after adding GBP in an assay was scored by counting 100 cells from a randomly selected field on the recorded tape. Purification of GBP-binding Protein—Hemolymph was collected from day 4 last instar larvae into an ice-cold microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of anticoagulant buffer (41 mm citric acid, 98 mm NaOH, 186 mm NaCl, 1.7 mm EDTA, pH 4.1) plus 0.5 mm p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 mm phenylthiourea, and 0.1 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Hemolymph was immediately centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and the collected supernatant subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The precipitate that appeared between 40 and 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate was dissolved in a lepidopteran saline (100 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 4.88 mm KH2PO4,15mm MgCl2,4mm CaCl2, and 30 mm sucrose) containing 0.1 mm protein inhibitor mixture and was dialyzed against 4 liters of the lepidopteran saline containing 0.05 mm N-phenylthiourea at 4 °C. The supernatant resulting from centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min was applied to affinity column chromatography on [biotin-Lys26]GBP-Streptavidin-Sepharose (1 × 3 cm) after passing through a HiTrap Streptavidin-Sepharose column (1 × 3 cm; Amersham Biosciences). Most of the protein with affinity against Streptavidin was absorbed to the HiTrap precolumn, and the protein with specific affinity against GBP was bound to the [biotin-Lys26]GBP-Streptavidin-Sepharose column. After washing well with 0.1 m KCl in the lepidopteran saline at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min for 1 h, a linear gradient elution of 0.1–2 m KCl in the lepidopteran saline was carried out. One major peak eluted at a concentration of about 1 m KCl was further applied to gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (16 × 60 cm; Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5) containing 0.1% CHAPS. The first major peak fraction eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min showed a specific affinity against GBP. Preparation of Rabbit Anti-GBP-binding Protein/IgG—The purified GBP-binding protein emulsified Titer Max Gold (CytRx Corporation) was injected to immunize a rabbit. Anti-GBP-binding protein/IgG was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 40% saturation and further purified by an affinity column of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Characterization—Purified GBP-binding protein or other hemolymph samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) by incubating with 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) containing 1% SDS and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol in boiling water for 3 min and developed by the methods of Laemmli (18Laemmli V.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Peptide mapping was performed according to the method of Cleaveland et al. (19Cleaveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After digesting 150 μg of GBP-binding protein with V8 endoproteinase, peptide fragments were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel and electrically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter, essentially according to Burnette (20Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5847) Google Scholar). The transferred peptide fragments of GBP-binding protein were sequenced using an automatic protein sequencer (PPSQ-21; Shimadzu Corp.). Construction of Hemocyte cDNA Library—Total RNA was isolated from whole body of day 1 last instar larvae of the armyworm larvae by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA was purified using the Quick Prep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA library was constructed using the Zap-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) and the Gigapack in vitro packaging kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence Analysis of GBP-binding Protein cDNA—Based on the N-terminal and internal peptide sequences determined by the peptide mapping and microsequencing described above, several degenerate primers were synthesized. Among them, by two primers, 5′-GIWSIYTIACIATHTTYYTI-3′ and 5′-TCIGCCATRTTIACIGCIGC-3′, the DNA fragment was amplified using the cDNA library as a template. The PCR amplification reaction was conducted according to the method of Hayakawa and Noguchi (22Hayakawa Y. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Six gene-specific primers were designed from the nucleotide sequence of the binding protein cDNA fragment. These primers were used in conjunction with the anchor primers in 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kits (Invitrogen) to amplify both ends of the binding protein gene from the cDNA library. PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript KS(-) (Stratagene) and sequenced using Thermo Sequenase II dye terminator cycle sequencing kits (Amersham Biosciences). All DNA segments were sequenced at least twice in both directions using an ABI PRISM TM377 DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystem). Computer-assisted sequence analysis was done with GENETYX-MAC Ver 10.1 (Software Development Co., Tokyo, Japan). BIAcore Analysis—Real-time surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore biosensor X system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min. [biotin-Lys26]GBP was immobilized to the Streptavidin sensor chip (Sensor Chip SA; Pharmacia Biosensor). A reference surface, to which no ligand was bound, was included on the chip. Various concentrations (0.0001–1nm) of GBP were preincubated with 18 nm GBP-binding protein at 25 °C for 6 h, and then each mixture was injected during the association phase with running buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 0.02% CHAPS in PBS, pH 7.0). Samples were injected in duplicate in random order in at least two separate experiments. The concentration of the GBP-binding protein bound to the sensor chip was calculated using the standard curve that had been previously made by BIA evaluation software 3.0 using resonance unit values for the injected standard solutions of the GBP-binding proteins. Kinetic analysis was evaluated by the Resolution affinity program in BIA evaluation software 3.0. Western and Northern Blot Analyses—After collecting hemolymph, other tissues such as brain-nerve cord, fat body, midgut, testis, and integument were dissected and washed well with PBS (pH 6.5). Isolated tissues were homogenized with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1% SDS and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins in each supernatant (final concentration of 2 μg/μl) separated by SDS-PAGE were electrically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter. Immunostaining with the anti-GBP-binding protein/IgG or anti-GBP/IgG was performed using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody according to the method of Hiraoka et al. (23Hiraoka T. Hayakawa Y. Downer R.G.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 279: 465-468Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Immediately after isolating tissues, total RNAs were isolated. 15 μg of total RNAs were denatured with formamide and formaldehyde and MOPS and separated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis in 20 mm MOPS, 0.3 m NaOAc, and 50 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). The RNAs were transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized at 42 °C in a hybridization solution containing 32P-labeled GBP-binding protein cDNA for 16 h. The membrane was washed with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min, 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 2 h, and then 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C, according to the protocols of Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Hemolymph was dropped into a chilled 1.5-ml centrifuge tube in anticoagulant buffer. Collected hemolymph was immediately centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. Pellet was resuspended in the anticoagulant buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h. After incubation, hemocytes were again centrifuged and the pellet was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 0.05 m PIPES, and 0.1 m sucrose (pH 6.0) at 25 °C for 30 min. Fixed hemocytes embedded in LR-Gold (London Resin; Surrey, UK) were thin-sectioned with a diamond knife and placed on Formvar-coated nickel grids (100-mesh). Specimens were rinsed with PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) and incubated for 15 h at 4 °C with anti-GBP-binding protein/IgG (10 μg/ml of 10% FBS-PBS). After a thorough washing in PBS, the specimens were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in goat anti-rabbit/IgG conjugated to colloidal gold particles (15 nm; British Biocell International), with 10% FBS. The grids were washed with PBS and distilled water and dried. Finally, they were stained with urayl acetate and lead citrate (25Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17597) Google Scholar). For control, thin sections were treated with non-immunized rabbit IgG. GBP-induced Hemolysis in Oenocytoids—When hemocytes isolated from the armyworm P. separata larvae were incubated with 10 nm GBP, immune cells called plasmatocytes rapidly spread on the surface of the culture plate (1Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). During prolonged observation, we realized that another morphotype of hemocytes was lysed ∼20 min after the initiation of the plasmatocyte spreading (Fig. 1A). They were thought to be morphologically classified as oenocytoids. Because it was reported that oenocytoids contain prophenoloxidase in insect larvae (15Pech L.L. Trudeau D. Strand M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Ashida M. Ochiai M. Niki T. Tissue Cell. 1988; 20: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we confirmed this identification by showing that these hemocytes melanized when incubated in the medium containing Dopa (Fig. 1A). To assess the contribution of GBP to both the activation of plasmatocytes and the lysis of oenocytoids, time course studies were conducted for an 80-min period after exposure to 1 nm GBP. Plasmatocytes were stimulated following addition of GBP, and afterward oenocytoids began to be gradually lysed (Fig. 1B). The lag time between stimulation and lysis of respective cells was interpreted to indicate that the hemolysis could be related to an inhibitory mechanism(s) of the GBP-dependent plasmatocyte activation. Discovery of GBP-binding Protein—To examine whether oenocytoids release the inhibitory factor against GBP action, we examined effects of the cell-free medium after incubation of oenocytoids on plasmatocytes by adding the medium into the plasmatocyte-spreading assay system containing GBP (Fig. 2A). The incubation medium showed a dose-dependent capacity to decrease the GBP activity. Further, hemocyte-free plasma possesses a similar inhibitory activity against GBP (Fig. 2B), indicating that the medium as well as plasma could contain the factor that interacts with GBP. These results were interpreted to indicate two possibilities: the oenocytoid incubation medium and the plasma fraction might contain the factor with a specific binding capacity for GBP, or it might contain the factor with an effect against plasmatocytes to inhibit their spreading behavior. We examined the former possibility by trying to identify the GBP binding factor(s). Because prior studies indicated that a 26-amino acid GBP containing a C-terminal biotinylated Lys26 ([biotin-Lys26]GBP) retains the biological activity of a wild-type GBP (27Ohnishi A. Oda Y. Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 41: 37974-37979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), an affinity column was prepared using [biotin-Lys26]GBP as a ligand. The fraction between 40 and 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate solution was loaded on the affinity column and a linear gradient elution of 0.1–2 m KCl in PBS was carried out after washing well with 0.1 m KCl in PBS. One major peak fraction with affinity for GBP was rechromatographed by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Fig. 2C). An analysis of the active peak fraction by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions yielded a single band that indicates a molecular mass of ∼49 kDa (Fig. 2C). Based on the partially characterized primary structures of the purified GBP-binding protein, degenerate primers were synthesized. By a combination of primary PCR using these primers and following 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR, GBP-binding protein cDNA was isolated and sequenced (Fig. 3A). The deduced 430-amino acid sequence with a molecular mass of 49.5 kDa is a novel protein containing a C-terminal region displaying limited homology to several insect lipoproteins such as 30k-lipoprotein (28Mori S. Izumi S. Tomino S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and microvitellogenin (29Wang X.Y. Cole K.D. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8851-8855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Further, this protein appears not to have a signal peptide and transmembrane domain. These results are consistent with our observation that the binding protein was released through hemolysis of oenocytoids by GBP as shown in Fig. 1A. Characterization of Binding between GBP and GBP-binding Protein—The direct and specific binding between GBP and the purified binding protein was demonstrated by real-time interaction analyses with immobilized [biotin-Lys26]GBP using surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 4A). A calculated mean dissociation constant of 74 pm (based on a 1:1 binding between the binding protein and the immobilized GBP) indicates a very stable complex. Further, the purified protein clearly decreased GBP-induced plasmatocyte spreading (Fig. 4B). The release of the binding protein from hemocytes in response to GBP and following binding between both factors in vitro was demonstrated by the evidence showing that [biotin-Lys26]GBP bound to the protein cross-reacted with anti-GBP-binding protein IgG in the medium. Further, the concentration of [biotin-Lys26]GBP bound with the binding protein was clearly increased during 30 min after addition of the biotinylated GBP (Fig. 4C). Finally, to analyze how an external stimulus affects both factors, their concentrations were measured in the hemolymph of bacteria-injected larvae. Western blots showed that both GBP and the binding protein were rapidly increased 5–15 min after the injection (Fig. 4D); at this time, a complex formation between both factors was demonstrated by the evidence that the protein immunoprecipitated by anti-GBP-binding protein IgG contains GBP (Fig. 4E). Thereafter, both factors clearly decreased from hemolymph within 30–60 min after the bacterial challenge (Fig. 4D). These results were interpreted to indicate that the GBP-binding protein could trap free GBP molecules and scavenge them to some extent. Distribution of GBP-binding Protein and Its mRNA—To investigate the expression site of the binding protein, Northern and Western blots were carried out. The analysis of total cellular RNAs from various larval tissues showed the presence of the binding protein mRNA only in hemocytes (Fig. 5A). This result was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-GBP-binding protein antibody; the positive bands with an apparent molecular mass of 49 kDa were found in hemocytes and plasma (Fig. 5A). To confirm unambiguously which cell type(s) contains the binding protein, immunoelectron microscopy was conducted using the binding protein antibody. As we expected, oenocytoids were labeled most densely among the classes of hemocytes (Fig. 5B), although gold particles were seen at a much lesser density in granular cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with our first observation that GBP-binding protein levels rose in the incubation medium during the process of oenocytoid lysis. The present study was focused on the postregulation of the insect cytokine GBP activity, although it is also regulated before exerting its activity. It has been reported that six members of the ENF family are produced as part of a precursor protein, with the active peptide at the C terminus of the protein (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Commun. 2001; 286: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In all ENF peptide precursors characterized so far, either a Lys-X-Gly-Arg or an X-Lys-Gly-Arg residue precedes the putative cleavage site for activation of proENF peptide. Thus, these conserved sequences likely serve as recognition sites for processing endoproteinase(s). These sequences are similar to the consensus cleavage site (Glu↓Asp-Gly-Arg) for factor Xa, a main component of the mammalian blood coagulation system. In fact, Manduca sexta PP2, one of the ENF family peptides, was produced by processing of proPP2 by bovine factor Xa (12Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Further, a serine protease partially purified from the Golgi body-rich fraction of P. separata larval fat body processed proGBP (33Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Endo Y. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as well as a synthetic peptide substrate (Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA) specific for factor Xa. 2H. Matsumoto and Y. Hayakawa, unpublished data. Because insects generally have a poor blood coagulation system that is mainly managed by hemocytes and because plasma gelation has been observed only in limited species such as a locust and cockroach (34Frank H. Zool. Jahrb. Abt. Allg. Zool. Physiol. Tiere. 1960; 68: 499-518Google Scholar, 35Frank H. Zool. Jahrb. Abt. Allg. Zool. Physiol. Tiere. 1960; 69: 131-132Google Scholar, 36Brehelin M.M. Acrida. 1972; 1: 165-175Google Scholar), it is worth emphasizing that a serine protease whose substrate specificity resembles factor Xa serves as a processing enzyme of the insect cytokine precursor. Although the protein precursor of the ENF peptide is activated in a manner analogous to those with most of the neuroactive and other biogenic peptides (37Crine P. Boileau G. Boulton A.A. Baker G.B. Pittman Q.G. in Neuromethods.6.Peptides. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1987: 1-44Google Scholar), the latter events following activation of the cytokine precursor have been poorly understood in insects as well as mammals. In the last instar larvae of Lepidoptera, the proportion of immune potent cells such as plasmatocytes and granular cells is extremely high: the two cell types comprise greater than 90% of the total circulating hemocyte population in Pseudoplusia includens (13Strand M.R. Clark K.C. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 42: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 38Strand M.R. Clark K.C. Gardner E.M.M. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 40: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If the hemolymph concentration of the ENF peptide continuously keeps high enough to activate these immune cells, the larvae would possibly suffer serious damages through unnecessary excessive stimulation of these cells. The present study identified a novel hemolymph protein with a strong affinity specific for GBP. The kinetic (Fig. 4A) and biological (Fig. 4, B and C) analyses for this protein indicated that it has a strong binding capacity to inhibit GBP action. Further, once GBP and the binding protein form a complex, it is likely to be promptly degraded in hemolymph (Fig. 4, D and E). Based on these facts, it is reasonable to expect that this factor would serve as a scavenger protein against GBP. In mammals, it is well known that insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) regulate the cellular actions of the IGFs because of their strong affinities (39Rajaram S Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 801-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). IGFBPs generally potentiate IGF actions by increasing their circulating half-life and by affecting their tissue distribution and localization (40Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Roberts Jr., C.T. The IGF System. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1999: 227-255Crossref Google Scholar). Although at least six IGFBPs have been reported, none of them shares any significant similarity with the GBP binding peptide in terms of their biological activities as well as structures. Recently, an interleukin-18-binding protein (IL-18BP) has been found in human urine. IL-18BP expressed constitutively mainly in the spleen acts as a natural inhibitor of IL-18-induced interferon-γ and suppresses the T-lymphocyte helper type 1 response (41Novick D. Kim S.-H. Fantuzzi G. Reznikov L. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Although IL-18BP functions as a cytokine inhibitor just as GBP-binding protein does, the two proteins do not share any structural similarity. Biological (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2A) and immunocytochemical (Fig. 5B) experiments demonstrated that the binding protein is released from oenocytoids through the GBP-induced hemolysis. This conclusion was supported by the fact that the amino acid sequence of the binding protein deduced from its cDNA does not contain the signal peptide region. Therefore, it is thought that GBP stimulates two different types of hemocytes to regulate cellular immunity: the defense reaction is initiated and terminated by stimulation of plasmatocytes and oenocytoids, respectively. Given that GBP serves to stimulate plasmatocytes as a potent cytokine and that the GBP-induced oenocytoid lysis follow the plasmatocyte activation, it is reasonable to propose that the GBP-binding protein released from oenocytoids scavenges GBP in the hemocoel in order to prevent GBP from excessively stimulating the immune cells. It is also reasonable to propose that this termination system of cellular immunity is triggered through the specific hemolytic action of GBP on oenocytoids. It is generally acknowledged that, although insects lack lymphocytes to produce unique immunoglobulins, insects have a cellular immunity that reacts quickly to foreign objects. The present study demonstrated that GBP would be able to regulate the insect cellular immunoreaction through the stimulation of completely different types of the cells. We thank Prof. Michael R.

AGE levels are pathologically elevated in a number of inflammatory diseases and in diabetes mellitus. There is evidence that AGEs, acting through the receptor for AGEs, contribute to diabetic complications. Nephropathy is a major complication of diabetes mellitus. However, the initiating molecular events that trigger diabetic renal disease are unknown. Renal mesangial cells produce excess extracellular matrix in response to treatment with transforming growth factor-β, and excess mesangial cell matrix production, by impairing glomerular filtration, contributes to diabetic nephropathy. AGEs are known to trigger the autocrine production and release of transforming growth factor-β. However, it is unclear how AGEs signal in mesangial cells. Here we show that treatment of mesangial cells with AGEs and with the receptor for AGEs agonist S100 triggers activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) pathways. AGEs trigger the GTP loading of mesangial cell Ras, and AGE activation of ERK requires Ras. We observe that Ki-Ras, but not Ha-Ras, is the target of AGE action. Surprisingly, inhibition of PI3K blocks both ERK and Ki-Ras activation. We also observe that activation of ERK and the PI3K target kinase protein kinase-B is blocked with free radical scavengers, indicating a role for reactive oxygen species in AGE recruitment of PI3K.

RAGE interacts with a surprisingly diverse variety of extracellular ligands. Chief among these are advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (1Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar).AGEs are produced by a non-enzymatic, Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and either proteins or lipids. AGEs accumulate slowly with normal aging and at a much accelerated rate in a variety of inflammatory conditions and diabetes mellitus. The elevated accumulation of AGEs has been linked to the pathophysiology of diabetic peripheral vascular disease, and the AGE-RAGE interaction has been shown to play a central role in the development of diabetic vasculopathy (2Singh R. Barden A. Mori T. Beilin L. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar, 3Yamagishi S. Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Contrib.

Diabetes Metab. 2001; 27: 535-542PubMed Google Scholar).Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure, and much of the morbidity and mortality of diabetes can be attributed to nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is associated with the pathophysiologic deposition of extracellular matrix proteins into the glomerular basement membrane. This matrix deposition is carried out largely by renal mesangial cells. A significant consequence of excess matrix deposition is increased glomerular filtration pressure. Renal mesangial cell hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis ensue, resulting ultimately in a loss of renal filtration function (6Wolf G. Ziyadeh F.N. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). There is good evidence that AGEs are important to the early events in diabetic nephropathy. The dysfunctional production of matrix proteins by mesangial cells is triggered largely by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Administration of AGEs to cultured glomerular endothelial cells leads to the elevated autocrine expression of mesangial cell TGF-β that, in turn, could stimulate matrix protein production by neighboring mesangial cells in the glomerulus (7Chen S. Cohen M.P. Lautenslager G.T. Shearman C.W. Ziyadeh F.N. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 673-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, transgenic overexpression of RAGE in a mouse line prone to diabetes leads to the rapid development of renal disease by a process that can be reversed with AGE inhibitors (8Yamamoto Y. Kato I. Doi T. Yonekura H. Ohashi S. Takeuchi M. Watanabe T. Yamagishi S. Sakyrai S. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Yamamoto H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar).Still, little is known of how AGEs, through RAGE, signal in mesangial cells, an important consideration if the early events of diabetic nephropathy are to be understood. The intracellular extension of RAGE is small and has no apparent catalytic function (1Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). However, mutant RAGE proteins missing the cytoplasmic domain are inactive and can function as dominant inhibitors of AGE signaling (9Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Thus, either RAGE signals through its intracellular extension, or this extension is required for RAGE to recruit a coreceptor with signaling properties. Activation by AGEs of the Janus kinases, nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNKs/SAPKs) has been reported, as has activation of Ras (9Huttunen H.J.

However, it is not known how RAGE couples to these pathways.Here we show that the mesangial cell ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) pathways are activated by AGEs. JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK are not activated in these cells. We also show that the GTP loading of mesangial cell Ras is stimulated by AGEs and that ERK activation is Ras-dependent. We find that mesangial cell Ki-Ras, but not Ha-Ras, is recruited by AGEs. PI3K is a Ras effector in most, but not all, signaling pathways (13Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), with MAPK and PI3K effectors functioning largely in parallel to execute cellular signaling programs. Surprisingly, however, we find that activation of both mesangial cell Ras (Ki-Ras) and ERK requires PI3-kinase. We also find that ERK and PI3K activation by AGEs is dependent upon the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and on non-receptor Tyr kinases (NRTKs) of the Src family. Our results suggest that AGEs exploit an unusual PI3K-dependent mechanism for signaling to monomeric GTPases and MAPKs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Treatments, and Reagents—Renal mesangial cells were isolated from the glomeruli of male Sprague-Dawley rats (125–175 g) as described (14Kreisberg J.I. Venkatchalam M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C505-C511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mml-glutamine, and penicillin streptomycin solution (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). Integrity of the mesangial cell phenotype was confirmed regularly by immunoblotting with anti-smooth muscle actin and Thy1 antibodies. For AGE and other treatments, cells were serum-starved for 48 h and treated with AGE (100 μg/ml), sorbitol (300 mm), S100 (5 μg/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml), endothelin-1 (ET-1, 100 nm), or H2O2 (0.1 mm) for either 15 min or for the times shown in the figures. As indicated, cells were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin, 20 μm LY294002, 10 μm U0126, or 20 mm N-acetyl cysteine (NAc), 50 μm ammonium pyrrolidinecarbodithioate (PDTC), 5 μm diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), 50 μm 4,4-isopropylidenedithio-bis-(2,6-t-butyl)-phenol (probucol), or 20 μm 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine (PP2) for 30 min in some experiments. PDTC and DPI were from Sigma; EGF, ET-1, S100, U0126, LY294002, wortmannin, probucol, and PP2 were from Calbiochem. AGE was prepared from crystallized, lyophilized bovine serum albumin and glucose as described (7Chen S. Cohen M.P. Lautenslager G.T. Shearman C.W. Ziyadeh F.N. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 673-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus encoding M2-FLAG-N17-Ras was prepared as described (15Choukroun G. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were infected, at a multiplicity of infection of 200, with virus 12 h before treatment with S100.Kinase Assays—ERK and JNK/SAPK immune complex kinase assays were performed as described (16Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (1–135), respectively, were used as substrates. In addition, in vivo phosphorylation of the activating regulatory phosphoacceptor sites on ERK-1 and -2, p38 MAPK, and protein kinase B (PKB) was assayed with the relevant phospho-specific antibodies. Thus, cells were lysed in 500 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Equal amounts of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (16Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used antibodies against specific phosphoacceptor residues for ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), (Thr-180/Tyr-182), and PKB (Thr-473), all from Cell Signaling Technology. In parallel, we employed rabbit anti-total ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and PKB (Cell Signaling Technology).Ras GTP Loading Assays—The activation of Ras was detected as the acquisition of the ability to bind the immobilized Ras binding domain of Ras effector Raf-1 (amino acids 51–131), expressed as a GST fusion protein and bound to glutathione-agarose (18Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, cells were treated with the agonists indicated in the figures, and lysates were prepared in a buffer designed to maintain the guanine nucleotide binding status of G proteins (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin and pepstatin). Lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated for 1 h with 20 μl (settled) of glutathione-agarose to which 20 μg of GST-Raf-1 (51–131) had been coupled. Beads were quickly washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Pan-Ras, Ki-Ras, or Ha-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as indicated.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONActivation of ERK and PI3K by AGE and the RAGE Agonist S100 —RAGE interacts with a diverse collection of extracellular stimuli, including AGEs, amphoterin, and the calgranulin S100 (1Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Yan S.F. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). We were interested in identifying signaling pathways activated by more than one RAGE agonist. PI3K and its effectors are essential to the control of cell survival, cell size, proliferation, and metabolism. Of note, PI3K effectors have been implicated in cardiomyocyte and mesangial cell hypertrophy (17Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5427-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The products of PI3K activity are absolutely required for phosphorylation at Ser-308 and -473 and consequent activation of PKB, a reaction catalyzed by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, which phosphorylates Ser-308, and a second unidentified kinase that targets PKB Ser-473 (21Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2494) Google Scholar, 22Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B.

Thus, phosphorylation of PKB is a facile readout for activation of the PI3K pathway. AGE and S100 treatment leads to rapid phosphorylation and activation of rat renal mesangial cell PKB as detected on immunoblots probed with antibodies directed toward PKB phosphorylated at Ser-473 (Fig. 1A). Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is phosphorylated and inhibited by PKB, an event that is associated with the recruitment of many transcriptional programs themselves inhibited by GSK3. We also observe that S100 triggers the phosphorylation of GSK3β (at Ser-9), indicating recruitment of a functional PI3K→PKB→GSK3 pathway (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a role for PI3K, PKB activation by either AGE or S100 is blocked with wortmannin, a highly specific inhibitor of PI3K (13Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A).Hyperglycemia has been implicated as a trigger for renal mesangial cell pathology in diabetes. Treatment of mesangial cells with elevated glucose has been shown to activate immediate early gene expression and to potentiate the activation of signaling pathways by other stimuli (24Ziyadeh F.N. Sharma K. Eriksen M. Wolf G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we find that culture of mesangial cells for 24 h in 30 mm glucose significantly activates the PI3K pathway. S100 further enhances glucose activation of PKB. Glucose has no effect on PKB levels (Fig. 1B).AGE and S100 treatment of mesangial cells also elicits substantial activation of the ERK subgroup of MAPKs (Fig. 2A). Activation is comparable with that incurred by ET-1. By contrast, neither AGE nor S100 activates the mesangial cell JNK/SAPK or the p38 MAPKs under conditions wherein, respectively, ET-1 and sorbitol produce robust activation of these MAPKs (Fig. 2, B and C). As with PI3K signaling, basal and S100-stimulated ERK phosphorylation and activation are modestly elevated by increasing the glucose concentration in the media from 10 to 17 mm for 24 h; this elevation is catalytic inasmuch as ERK polypeptide levels are not affected by higher glucose (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 2Activation of MAPK pathways by S100. Cells were treated for 15 min with ET-1, sorbitol, AGE, or S100 as indicated at the concentrations described under “Experimental Procedures.” Some of the cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin (wort; 30 min) prior to addition of S100 or AGE. Lysates were prepared and normalized to equal protein concentration. A, ERK assays. ERK was immunoprecipitated from the extracts and assayed using myelin basic protein as a substrate. B, JNK/SAPK assays. JNK/SAPK was immunoprecipitated and assayed using GST-c-Jun (1–135) as a substrate. C, p38 MAPK assays. Equal amounts of cell lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p38 or anti-total p38.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3S100 activation of ERK is PI3K-dependent. Mesangial cells were pretreated with either wortmannin (wort; 30 min) or high glucose (24 h) or both as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then treated with S100, ET-1, or EGF for 15 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, ERK immune complex kinase assays using myelin basic protein as a substrate. B, in vivo activating phosphorylation of ERKs. Equal amounts of cell extract protein from each treatment were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK or anti-total ERK as indicated. C, specificity of PI3K-dependence of ERK activation. Wortmannin only inhibits S100 activation of ERK and not ET-1 or EGF activation of ERK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, both AGE and S100 activate identical signaling pathways in mesangial cells, and S100 is a reasonable RAGE agonist in these cells. In further support of this, activation of ERK and PKB by both AGE and S100 can be completely inhibited with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Figs. 1A, 2A, and 3; discussed below).RAGE-mediated ERK Activation Is PI3K- and Ras-dependent—Canonical signaling pathways emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases and trimeric G protein-coupled receptors typically require the monomeric G protein Ras (25Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinase Functions. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 40-156Google Scholar). GTP loading and consequent activation of Ras leads to recruitment of effectors that include PI3K and the Rafs, MAPK-kinase-kinases upstream of ERK. Raf/ERK and PI3K are then thought to execute parallel, largely discrete, signaling pathways that evoke the relevant cellular responses (13Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 25Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinase Functions. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 40-156Google Scholar). There are, however, exceptions to this paradigm. For example, constitutively active PI3K can trigger Ras GTP loading in Xenopus oocytes (26Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A. Fant. W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and signaling to Ras and ERK from the B cell receptor can be completely blocked with PI3K inhibitors (27Jacob A. Cooney D. Pradhan M. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23420-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Interestingly, we find that mesangial cell ERK phosphorylation and activation by AGE are substantially inhibited by either wortmannin (Fig. 3, B and C and Fig. 6A) or LY294002, a second highly specific PI3K inhibitor (13Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that AGEs trigger PI3K-dependent ERK activation. ET-1 and EGF activation of ERK are unaffected by wortmannin (Fig. 3C), and EGF activation of ERK is unaffected by LY294002 (Fig. 6C). Thus, in mesangial cells, PI3K-dependent ERK activation is a phenomenon relatively specific to AGE signaling and is not a feature of receptor tyrosine kinase (EGF receptor) or trimeric G protein-coupled receptor (ET-1 receptor) signaling in mesangial cells.Fig. 6RAGE selectively recruits Ki-Ras in a PI3K-dependent manner. A, rat mesangial cells were treated for 15 min (ERK and PKB activation assays) or 2 min (Ras assays) with EGF or S100 as indicated either with or without preincubation with wortmannin (wort; 30 min) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ki- or Ha-Ras activation was determined as in Fig. 5, except that specific Ki- or Ha-Ras antibodies were used to distinguish between the two Ras isoforms. B, EGF and ET-1 activation of Ki-Ras is not PI3K-dependent. Rat mesangial cells were treated with EGF or ET-1 as indicated, either with or without prior wortmannin treatment (wort; 30 min) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ki-Ras activation was assayed as in panel A. ERK and PI3K→PKB were assayed as in Figs. 2 and 1 and as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, LY294002 also block S100 but not EGF activation of ERK and Ki-Ras. Mesangial cells were pretreated with LY294002 (LY) and then treated with EGF or S100 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Ki-Ras, ERK, and PKB were assayed as described (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PI3K is both an effector for Ras and, as noted above, is in some systems a contributor to Ras activation (13Katso R.

To explore the role of Ras in AGE activation of mesangial cell ERK, we used a recombinant adenovirus that expresses dominant inhibitory (N17)-Ras. From Fig. 4 it is clear that in mesangial cells infected with this virus, S100 no longer activates ERK. ERK activation is unaffected by infection with a control (β-galactosidase) virus. Thus, RAGE signals to ERK through a Ras and PI3K-dependent mechanism.Fig. 4S100 and ET-1 activation of mesangial cell ERK is Ras-dependent. Mesangial cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding FLAG-N17 dominant inhibitory Ras. 24 h later cells were treated with ET-1 or S100 as indicated. ERK was assayed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK antibody. Total ERK and FLAG-N17-Ras were detected in parallel immunoblots with the cognate antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RAGE Activation of Ras Is PI3K-dependent; RAGE Selectively Recruits Ki-Ras—Monomeric G proteins of the Ras superfamily are inactive in the GDP-bound state and active in the GTP-bound state. Ras proteins have a slow intrinsic GTPase activity that is accelerated by GTPase activating proteins. Activation of Ras proteins is mediated by guanyl nucleotide exchange factors that accelerate GDP release. Inasmuch as GTP is in excess in the cell, GDP release is followed swiftly by GTP binding (25Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinase Functions. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 40-156Google Scholar). Active Ras proteins acquire the ability to bind effector proteins (25Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinase Functions. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 40-156Google Scholar); accordingly, detection of this binding can serve as a convenient method for monitoring Ras protein activation. The MAP3K Raf-1 is an established effector for Ras. Binding of Raf-1 to Ras results in Raf-1 membrane translocation and is a key rate-limiting step in Raf-1 activation (25Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinase Functions. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 40-156Google Scholar). Amino acids 51–131 of the Raf-1 polypeptide contain the domain involved in GTP-dependent Ras binding (26Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A. Fant. W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). A GST-Raf-1 (51–131) fusion protein, immobilized on glutathione-agarose, can selectively trap GTP-Ras produced in cells consequent to extracellular signals and can be used to follow the stimulus-dependent accumulation of activated Ras (18Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).We treated mesangial cells with S100, EGF, or ET-1. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with immobilized GST-Raf-1 (51–131). From Fig. 5A, it is evident that EGF triggers a strong activation of Ras detectable as Ras immunoreactivity recovered on the Raf-1 (51–131) beads. S100 and ET-1 also stimulate substantial Ras activation. Ras activation by S100 is comparatively transient, reaching a maximum at 2 min (Fig. 5B). We also observe that Ras activation by S100 is completely reversed with wortmannin, suggesting RAGE recruits Ras through a PI3K-dependent mechanism (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5PI3K-dependent activation of mesangial cell Ras by S100. A, mesangial cells were treated for 2 min with EGF, ET-1, and S100 as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with immobilized GST-Raf-1 (51–131).

C3aR is a G-protein-coupled receptor with an exceptionally large second extracellular loop of 172 amino acids. Previously reported deletion studies have shown that at least part of this region plays a critical role in binding C3a. Our data now demonstrate that five tyrosines in the second extracellular loop of the C3aR are posttranslationally modified by the addition of sulfate. Blocking sulfation by mutation of tyrosine to phenylalanine at positions 184, 188, 317, and/or 318 does not affect ligand binding or signal transduction. However, when tyrosine 174 is mutated to phenylalanine, binding of native C3a is completely blocked. This variant efficiently mobilizes calcium in response to synthetic C3a agonist peptides, but not to native C3a. This finding is consistent with a two-site model of ligand association typical of many peptide ligand-receptor interactions and identifies sulfotyrosine 174 as the critical C3a docking site. Tyrosine sulfation in the amino-terminal extracellular domain has been shown to be important in several other seven-transmembrane segment receptors.

Several chemokine receptors, including CCR5, CXCR4, CX3CR1, and CCR2b, have been shown to be sulfated on tyrosines in their amino-terminal domains, and at least some of this sulfation is critical for ligand binding (23Farzan M.

For example, sulfotyrosine in the amino-terminal sequence of CCR5 is required for binding of the natural ligands MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and certain HIV-1 GP120/CD4 complexes as well as the binding and entry of the CCR5-using strains of HIV-1 (23Farzan M.

Amino-terminal sulfation of tyrosines in the C5a receptor also contributes to formation of the docking (but not the signaling) site for the C5a anaphylatoxin (14Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine sulfation is a critical modification for conferring the natural function of a number of 7TMS receptors. To date, all the reported functional sulfotyrosines identified in 7TMS receptors have occurred in the amino-terminal extracellular domains. In contrast to the C5aR, which has an acidic and tyrosine-rich motif at its amino terminus, the C3aR does not (11Crass T. Raffetseder U. Martin U. Grove M. Klos A. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Ames R.S. Li Y. Sarau H.M. Nuthulaganti P. Foley J.J. Ellis C. Zeng Z. Su K. Jurewicz A.J. Hertzberg R.P.

There are nine predicted tyrosines in the full-length human C3aR, seven of which are located at positions 174, 184, 188, 255, 306, 317, and 318, all in ECL2, and some of these are flanked by acidic amino acids. The two remaining tyrosines are in the sixth and seventh transmembrane sequences. The multiplicity of tyrosines, coupled with the unusually large ECL2, raised the possibility that tyrosine sulfation may occur in this domain and that this modification may contribute to the binding of C3a. Here we demonstrate that five of the seven tyrosines in ECL2 of the C3aR are sulfated, but only one, tyrosine 174, is essential for binding and signaling with native C3a. The C3aR variant in which tyrosine 174 was mutated to phenylalanine mobilized calcium in response to 8- and 15-residue synthetic peptides containing the carboxyl terminus of C3a, consistent with a two-site model of ligand association. These data not only define the precise structural requirement for the C3a docking site but also demonstrate that tyrosine sulfation can occur at sites distinct from the amino-terminal regions of 7TMS receptors. Cells, Plasmids, Antibodies, and Peptides—HEK 293T and Cf2Th cells were obtained form the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (CRL115544 and CRL 1430, respectively). 293 GP packaging cells were purchased from BD Biosciences. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. An expression plasmid encoding the human C3aR with the addition of a ten-amino acid tag at its amino terminus (Myc tag) and a nine-amino acid extension at its carboxyl terminus (C9 tag) was generated by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA and subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). All the C3aR variants in which one or more tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine (see Table I) were made by the PCR-based QuikChange method (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing the entire reading frame. The antibody 1D4, which recognizes the C9 tag, and 9E10, which binds the Myc tag, were provided by the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). The C3aR agonist peptides, containing 8 and 15 residues (AAALGLAR and WWGKKYRASKLGLAR, respectively) (27Ember J.A. Johansen N.L. Hugli T.E.

One day later, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subcultured into three separate aliquots. One of each of the flasks was labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine ([35S]-Express, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), one was labeled with [35S]sulfate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) overnight, and the third was retained for binding and flow cytometry. Cells were treated with 3 mg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit N-glycosylation 5 h prior to and throughout the labeling period (14Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated in the presence of the anti-C9-tag antibody, 1D4, covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1% N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in PBS containing 0.5% SDS and once with PBS and then eluted with SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions by heating at 55 °C for 10 min and analyzed by autoradiography following electrophoresis on 12% SDS Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). O-linked carbohydrates were enzymatically removed from immunoprecipitated C3a receptors using O-glycanase (Glyko) and neuraminidase. N-linked carbohydrates were removed with PNGase F (New England Biolabs), as described by the manufacturer under non-denaturing conditions, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed as above on 12% SDS gels. Binding of C3a to Cells Expressing C3aR and C3aR Variants— Binding experiments were performed using HEK 293T cells transfected with wild type C3aR or C3aR variants. Two days after transfection, cells were detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, counted, and resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide) at 2 × 106/ml. An aliquot of cells was subjected to flow cytometric analysis to control for the relative expression levels of the receptors. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-Myc antibody 9E10 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed using a FACS-Star cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For binding, duplicate aliquots of 50 μl were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-C3a (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0–200 nm unlabeled C3a (Advanced Research Technologies) for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl. Cells were centrifuged, washed once with binding buffer, and bound C3a was determined by γ-counting. Binding data were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using Prism software (GraphPad). For some experiments, the degree of sulfation was modified by co-transfecting the C3aR variant YFFFF with plasmids encoding TPST1 and 2 to increase sulfation or with shRNA constructs directed against TPST1 and 2 to inhibit sulfation. Controls included co-transfection of the C3aR variant with pcDNA3.1 without insert. Calcium Mobilization Mediated by the C3aR and C3aR Variants— The transduction vector pQCXIX (BD Biosciences) encoding the wild type C3aR or C3aR variants FYYYY and YFFFF (see Table I) were co-transfected into 293 GP packaging cells (BD Biosciences) with plasmids encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) envelope and Gag/Pol using calcium phosphate. Two days later, the culture supernatants were collected, and virus particles were concentrated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 75 min. This concentrated virus was resuspended in 0.5-ml cell culture media and used to infect Cf2 cells, which were plated at 3× 105 cells per well in 12-well plates 1 day before. One day later, the infected Cf2 cells were transferred to flasks and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for at least 24 h. Receptor expression was quantified by flow cytometric analysis as described above. Cells were harvested, counted, and incubated with the indicator dye Fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm glucose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in the same buffer at 1× 106/ml. Changes in intracellular calcium concentration in response to C3a or C3a synthetic peptide agonists were determined fluorometrically at 37 °C by monitoring the emission at 510 nm and the excitation at 340 and 380 nm as a function of a time. Responses were quantified as the peak of the fluorescence ratio of 340/380 nm. Measurements were made using cells from at least three independent infections. Tyrosines in the ECL2 of the C3aR Are Sulfated—Previous work has shown that the sulfation of tyrosines on the extracellular amino-terminal domain of the C5a anaphylatoxin receptor is a critically important posttranslational modification for ligand recognition (14Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given the similarities of the C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins and their receptors, we hypothesized that a similar posttranslational modification might be important for C3aR function as well. The C3aR has no sulfatable tyrosines in its extracellular amino-terminal sequence; however, seven are evident in the unusually large ECL2 consisting of 172 amino acids (12Ames R.S. Li Y. Sarau H.M. Nuthulaganti P. Foley J.J. Ellis C. Zeng Z. Su K. Jurewicz A.J. Hertzberg R.P. Bergsma D.J Kumar C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20231-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, the tyrosines at positions 184, 188, 317, and 318 are flanked by acidic residues characteristic of preferred sites for sulfation (21Niehrs C. Huttner W.B. Carvallo D. Degryse E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9314-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rosenquist G.L. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Studies with chimeric C3a/C5a receptors and several ECL2 deletion mutants have shown that ECL2, particularly its amino acids adjacent to the fourth and fifth transmembrane sequences, is essential for C3a binding (15Chao T.H. Ember J.A. Wang M. Bayon Y. Hugli T.E. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Crass T. Ames R.S. Sarau H.M.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that one or more of the tyrosines in this region is sulfated and plays a role in C3a binding and signal transduction. Tyrosines at positions 174, 184, 188, 317, and 318 in ECL2 were individually and multiply mutated to phenylalanine, as indicated in Table I. Constructs were transfected into mammalian cells and tested for expression, binding, and signal transduction. To facilitate the determination of relative levels of cell surface expression, expression plasmids were engineered to encode the wild type or mutant C3aRs fused in-frame with an amino-terminal Myc tag, which is recognized by the antibody 9E10. Immunoprecipitations were accomplished using the antibody 1D4, which is specific for the in-frame C9-tag at the carboxyl terminus, corresponding to the nine carboxyl-terminal amino acids of rhodopsin. Control experiments demonstrated that these modifications had no detectable effect on binding or signal transduction compared with native C3aR lacking these tags (not shown). Transfected HEK 293T cells were assessed for surface expression of wild type C3aR or C3aR variants by flow cytometry using the anti-Myc tag antibody and mean fluorescence compared for each experiment. Simultaneously, cells from the same transfection were labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate and lysed, and C3aRs were immunoprecipitated with the anti-C9 antibody, 1D4, cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose beads. To ensure selection of sulfation exclusively on tyrosines, tunicamycin was also included in the culture medium (10Roglic A. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Pan Z. Zou A. Ye R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1305: 39-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Crass T. Raffetseder U. Martin U. Grove M. Klos A. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J.

Bergsma D.J Kumar C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20231-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, cells expressing the wild type C3a receptor and grown in the absence of tunicamycin reveal a predominant form migrating with an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa that is labeled with both [35S]Cys/Met and [35S]sulfate. A minor form migrates at ∼50kDa that labels only with [35S]Cys/Met and is presumably an immature intracellular receptor. The addition of tunicamycin to the culture medium prior to and during labeling results in a mature C3aR of 75–80 kDa in addition to the non-sulfated form at ∼50 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence includes a number of potential O-linked glycosylation sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and ECL2, and when these are removed by O-glycanase treatment of immunoprecipitated C3aR, the receptor migrates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa. Because a previous report indicated an important role for sequences adjacent to transmembrane sequences 4 and 5 (15Chao T.H. Ember J.A. Wang M. Bayon Y. Hugli T.E. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we focused first on the tyrosines in these regions and generated the mutant receptors outlined in Table I. As shown in Fig. 2, only when all five tyrosines at positions 174, 184, 188, 317, and 318 in the ECL2 were changed to phenylalanine was the ability to incorporate [35S]sulfate lost, suggesting that tyrosines at 255 and 306 may not be sulfated. As we have observed previously with other 7TMS receptors (14Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), when multiple tyrosines are mutated to phenylalanine in the C3aR, particularly the YFFFF and FFFFF variants (see Table I), their electrophoretic mobility is increased, likely due to alterations in SDS binding. C3a Binding to Wild Type C3aR and C3aR Variants—To examine the functional importance of the sulfated tyrosines in the ECL2, we next compared the ability of 125I-C3a to associate with wild type C3aR and C3aR variants in which one or more of the five sulfated tyrosines in ECL2 was replaced with phenylalanine. Transfected HEK 293T cells expressing similar levels of wild type C3aR or C3aR variants, as indicated by their fluorescence intensity of anti-Myc-tagged antibody staining, were tested in competition binding experiments with 125I-C3a and increasing concentrations of unlabeled C3a as indicated. As shown in Fig. 3, HEK 293T cells expressing the C3aR variants YFYYY, YYYFF, and YFFFF bound C3a with affinities similar to the wild type receptor. Uniquely, binding to C3aR FYYYY was not detected. Cell surface expression of this mutant receptor was essentially the same as the wild type receptor. Calcium Mobilization through C3aR and Its Mutants—In the case of the C5a receptor, intact C5a was unable to induce a calcium flux when two of the three amino-terminal tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine, although a synthetic peptide agonist could still activate the same cells (13Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These data were interpreted as further supporting the two-site model for ligand-receptor interactions (30Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lu B. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18077-18082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptide agonists corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 8 or 15 amino acids of C3a have also been described (27Ember J.A. Johansen N.L. Hugli T.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and we sought to study them in parallel experiments. In 293T cells the C3a receptor, like the C5a receptor, requires co-transfection with Gα16 to elicit a calcium flux (31Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we have no convenient method to monitor expression of Gα16, we used Cf2 cells, which appear to endogenously express an intact Ca2+ signaling pathway for most G-protein-coupled receptors. These cells are relatively inefficiently transfected, so we packaged the wild type C3aR or C3aR variant expressing transduction vectors in murine leukemia viral particles pseudo-typed with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and used them to transduce Cf2 cells. Cells expressing wild type C3aR or its variants, C3aR YFFFF, which binds native C3a normally, and C3aR FYYYY, which does not, were tested for the ability to mobilize calcium in response to native C3a or the two synthetic C3a agonist peptides. As shown in Fig. 4, cells expressing wild type C3aR or C3aR YFFFF induced effective calcium signals in response to 100 nm native C3a, whereas the FYYYY variant failed to do so. In contrast, all three receptors, wild type C3aR, C3aR FYYYY, and C3aR YFFFF, responded almost equally well to both of the synthetic C3a agonists. Thus, the lack of calcium mobilization by the FYYYY variant is not due to a global alteration of receptor structure. The data further suggest that the C3a receptor, like the C5a receptor (14Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lu B. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18077-18082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), presents distinct docking and activation sites for a ligand. Enzymatic Modulation of Sulfation—One possible explanation for the lack of C3a binding to C3aR FYYYY is the absence of sulfate on tyrosine 174. An alternative explanation could be that the expression of phenylalanine at this site altered receptor conformation due to the increase in hydrophobicity resulting from the absence of the hydroxyl group. We addressed these possibilities by altering the extent of C3aR sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is accomplished by tyrosine protein sulfotransferases 1 and 2. The activity of these enzymes can be modified by transfection, either with plasmids encoding the native enzymes to boost sulfation or with constructs encoding shRNAs targeting the TPSTs to inhibit them (28Choe H. Li W. Wright P.L. Vasilieva N. Venturi M. Huang C.-C. Grundner C. Dorfman T. Zwick M.B. Wang L. Rosenberg E.S. Kwong P.D. Burton D.R. Robinson J.E. Sodroski J.G. Farzan M. Cell. 2003; 114: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To try to increase C3aR sulfation, we co-transfected the C3aR variant YFFFF with plasmids encoding TPST1 and 2. Cells transfected with C3aR YFFFF alone or with TPST1 and 2 were assessed for receptor expression levels, binding, and extent of sulfation. As shown in Fig. 5, no change was observed for ligand binding or sulfation when cells were co-transfected with TPST1 and 2, suggesting that either the C3aR variant is already maximally sulfated in these cells or that the sulfate moiety is not critical. To test the possibility that C3aR YFFFF was maximally sulfated under these conditions, we transfected cells with C3aR YFFFF alone or in combination with shRNA constructs to target both TPST1 and 2. These cells were tested for C3aR expression and ligand binding as before. As shown in Fig. 6, although C3aR expression levels were quite similar, maximal binding was significantly reduced with no change in affinity. Consistent with the critical nature of this sulfotyrosine residue, incorporation of [35S]sulfate was commensurately reduced (Fig. 6). Thus sulfation of tyrosine 174 on the C3a receptor is a critical determinant for recognition of native C3a. The molecular cloning of the C3a receptor places this molecule in the superfamily of G-protein coupled 7TMS receptors (10Roglic A. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Pan Z. Zou A. Ye R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1305: 39-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Crass T. Raffetseder U. Martin U. Grove M. Klos A. Kohl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J.

Bergsma D.J Kumar C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20231-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Despite a number of similarities, the C3a receptor does not have a highly acidic tyrosine-rich amino-terminal sequence like the C5a receptor, which we have recently shown to be involved in its interaction with C5a (14Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The predicted extracellular amino-terminal sequence of the C3a receptor is relatively short (∼21 amino acids) and has been shown not to participate in C3a binding (15Chao T.H. Ember J.A. Wang M. Bayon Y. Hugli T.E. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Crass T. Ames R.S. Sarau H.M. Tornetta M.A. Foley J.J. Kohl J. Klos A. Bautsch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8367-8370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Instead, the C3aR has a large ECL2 that contains seven potentially sulfatable tyrosines. Here, we have shown that five of the seven tyrosines in this region of the C3a receptor are sulfated and that sulfotyrosine 174 alone plays a critical role in the binding and signaling of native C3a. The absence of sulfotyrosine 174 does not alter transduction in response to either of the two synthetic C3a peptide agonists tested, suggesting first, that this tyrosine-mutated C3aR variant is not completely inactivated. Second, the data lend support to a two-site model for ligand-receptor interactions similar to C5a and C5aR interactions as well as interactions between a number of other peptide ligand receptor pairs (30Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lu B. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18077-18082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The observation that native C3a does not signal in C3aR FYYYY-expressing cells while agonist peptide responses are not altered suggests that the “docking” step induces a conformational change in the ligand, exposing a structure that can subsequently activate the cell. Sulfation of tyrosines is a posttranslational modification occurring late in the trans-Golgi network (33Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and estimates indicate that up to 1% of all tyrosines in eukaryotic proteins are sulfated (34Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6434-6439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification is most appreciated on a large number of secreted proteins and in the extracellular domains of membrane-bound proteins (21Niehrs C. Huttner W.B. Carvallo D. Degryse E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9314-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). More recently, we and others have demonstrated the existence of sulfated tyrosines in amino-terminal sequences of several chemoattractant receptors that play a critical role in receptor function (23Farzan M.

Patel D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19418-19423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the case of the chemokine receptors CCR5, CXCR4, CCR2b, and CX3CR1, it is not clear whether distinct docking and activation sites exist, because small synthetic peptide agonists have not been identified. In contrast, the C5a anaphylatoxin receptor has been shown to contain sulfotyrosines in its amino terminus that are involved in formation of the docking site but not the activation site (14Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the C3a receptor, tyrosines at positions 184, 188, 317, and 318 are adjacent to or in the proximity of acidic amino acids, a feature that is believed to favor tyrosine sulfation, and our data are consistent with this prediction. Tyrosine 174, however, which is surrounded only by basic and neutral residues, is also sulfated. This appears to contradict the predicted substrate requirement for TPSTs and suggests that the substrate specificity may be considerably broader (35Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J. Rehfeld J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21700-21705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To ensure that the loss of C3a binding commensurate with the mutation of tyrosine 174 to phenylalanine reflected the loss of sulfate and not a change in receptor conformation, we attempted first to increase the extent of sulfation by co-transfecting the C3aR variant YFFFF with TPST1 and 2. An increase in sulfation without a change in the level of receptor expression should have increased the binding of ligand if the sulfate was important and the receptor less than maximally sulfated. Our data suggest this receptor variant is maximally sulfated, because no change was evident with overexpression of TPST; but when the co-transfections were performed using shRNA constructs targeting TPST1 and 2, both sulfation and binding were inhibited, with essentially no change in receptor expression. The observation of only partial reduction in C3a binding is reflective of the enzymatic activity of TPSTs synthesized prior to shRNA transfection. Tyrosine sulfation has been identified as a key mediator of protein-protein interactions involved in leukocyte adhesion, hemostasis, and chemokine signaling (36Kehoe J.W. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R57-R61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Sulfate is a charged and highly polarizable moiety that is likely to contribute significant free energy to the binding. Here we have shown that tyrosine at 174 is not only sulfated but that this sulfated moiety is critically important for C3a binding. This result is consistent with the previous report using deletion mutants of the C3aR, wherein deletion of amino acids from 198 to 308 in ECL2 (as much as 65% of this region) did not affect C3a binding or calcium mobilization (15Chao T.H. Ember J.A. Wang M. Bayon Y. Hugli T.E. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The removal of residues 174 to 183 resulted in a total loss of receptor function. Our findings demonstrate the importance of sulfotyrosine at 174 for C3a receptor function. It is curious that additional tyrosines in ECL2 are sulfated but have no apparent role in C3a-C3aR interactions. That finding, coupled with the unusual size of this receptor domain, suggests the possibility of additional ligands. Potential candidates might include other products of C3 that result from complement activation. Alternatively, this region may associate with another cell surface protein possibly modulating signal transduction. Taken together, our data support a two-site model in which the binding/docking site for the native ligand is separable from the activation/effector site. In other characterized receptors with peptide ligands, the docking/binding site resides in the acidic amino acid and tyrosine-rich amino termini, and the activation site includes ECL2 and transmembrane helices. In the case of the C3aR, the docking site also resides in ECL2 but is clearly separable from the activation site. Even though five tyrosines in this region of the C3aR are sulfated, only the tyrosine at 174 is involved in C3a binding."
https://openalex.org/W2059307822,"To bind DNA and to be retained in the nucleus, PBX proteins must form heterodimeric complexes with members of the MEINOX family. Therefore the balance between PBX and MEINOX must be an important regulatory feature. We show that overexpression of PREP-1 influences the level of PBX-2 protein maintaining the PREP-1-PBX balance. This effect has important functional consequences. F9 teratocarcinoma cells stably transfected with PREP-1 had an increased DNA binding activity to a PREP-PBX-responsive element. Because PREP-1 binds DNA efficiently only when dimerized to PBX, the increased DNA binding activity suggests that the level of PBX might also have increased. Indeed PREP-1-overexpressing cells had a higher level of PBX-2 and PBX-1b proteins. PBX-2 increase did not depend on increased mRNA level or a higher rate of translation but rather because of a protein stabilization process. Indeed, PBX-2 level drastically decreased after 3 h of cycloheximide treatment in control but not in PREP-1-overexpressing cells and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented PBX-2 decay in control cells. Hence, dimerization with PREP-1 appears to decrease proteasomal degradation of PBX-2. Retinoic acid induces differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells with a cascade synthesis of HOX proteins. In PREP-1-overexpressing cells, HOXb1 induction was more sustained (3 days versus 1 day) and the induced level of MEIS-1b, another TALE (three amino acid loop extension) protein involved in embryonal development, was higher. Thus an increase in PREP-1 leads to changes in the fate-determining HOXb1 and has therefore important functional consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2015214335,"As part of a study on the regulation of renal ammoniagenesis in the mouse kidney, we investigated the effect of chronic metabolic acidosis on glutamine synthesis by isolated mouse renal proximal tubules. The results obtained reveal that, in tubules from control mice, glutamine synthesis occurred at high rates from glutamate and proline and, to a lesser extent, from ornithine, alanine, and aspartate. A 48 h, metabolic acidosis caused a marked inhibition of glutamine synthesis from near-physiological concentrations of both alanine and proline that were avidly metabolized by the tubules; metabolic acidosis also greatly stimulated glutamine utilization and metabolism. These effects were accompanied by a large increase (i) in alanine, proline, and glutamine gluconeogenesis and (ii) in ammonia accumulation from proline and glutamine. In the renal cortex of acidotic mice, the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase increased 4-fold, but that of glutamate dehydrogenase did not change; in contrast with what is known in the rat renal cortex, metabolic acidosis markedly diminished the glutamine synthetase activity and protein level, but not the glutamine synthetase mRNA level in the mouse renal cortex. These results strongly suggest that, in the mouse kidney, glutamine synthetase is an important regulatory component of the availability of the ammonium ions to be excreted for defending systemic acid-base balance.

Biochem. J. 1935; 29: 1951-1969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Richterich R.W. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1958; 195: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4Janicki R.H. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 216: 1107-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, glutamine synthesis not only detoxifies ammonia, a potentially toxic compound to the nervous system (9Berl S. Clarke D.D. Häussinger D. Sies H. Glutamine Metabolism in Mammalian Tissues. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 223-234Crossref Google Scholar), but also contributes to the regulation of systemic acid-base balance by reducing the urinary excretion of ammonia in the form of ammonium ions. Contrasting with this important role in acid-base equilibrium control, it is surprising that metabolic acidosis does not alter glutamine synthetase activity in the rat renal cortex (4Janicki R.H. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 216: 1107-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Burch H.B. Choi S. McCarthy W.Z. Wong P.Y. Lowry O.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nephrol. 1991; 92: 211-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); indeed, under this circumstance, one would have expected a decreased activity of this enzyme to favor the renal excretion of ammonium ions. In the rat nephron, glutamine synthetase activity (6Burch H.B. Choi S. McCarthy W.Z. Wong P.Y. Lowry O.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and mRNAs and protein (10Schoolwerth A.C. de Boer P.A. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F400-F406PubMed Google Scholar) are restricted to the late part of the proximal tubule, i.e. the proximal straight tubule. By contrast, in the mouse kidney, in which glutamine synthetase activity is also present in the cortex (6Burch H.B. Choi S. McCarthy W.Z. Wong P.Y. Lowry O.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Lie-Venema H. de Boer P.A. Lamers W.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the mRNAs have been localized to the entire proximal tubule (12Kuo C.F. Darnell J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The latter finding demonstrating a different distribution of glutamine synthetase in the proximal tubules of the rat and mouse, together with the fact that adaptation to metabolic acidosis occurs mainly, if not exclusively, in the early segments of rat renal proximal tubules (13Curthoys N.P. Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wright P.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F53-F59PubMed Google Scholar, 15Burch H.B. Narins R.G. Chu C. Fagioli S. Choi S. McCarthy W. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 253: F246-F253Google Scholar), led us to consider that glutamine synthesis and its regulation in mouse renal proximal tubules might be intrinsically different from those commonly known in the rat. This is why, in this study, we decided (i) to investigate the capacity of mouse renal proximal tubules to synthesize glutamine and (ii) to test if metabolic acidosis would modify such synthesis. For this, we used miniaturized techniques recently developed in our laboratory to characterize glutamine utilization and metabolism in isolated renal proximal tubules from fed and fasted mice (16Conjard A. Brun V. Martin M. Baverel G. Ferrier B. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that mouse renal proximal tubules have the capacity to intensely synthesize glutamine from a variety of amino acids. They also show that, unlike in the rat kidney, metabolic acidosis led to a marked decrease in the glutamine synthetase protein and activity, but not in the corresponding mRNAs in the mouse renal cortex; this decrease was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the capacity of proximal tubules to synthesize glutamine from potentially physiological substrates of the mouse kidney in vivo. By contrast, like in the rat kidney, metabolic acidosis stimulated glutamine utilization and ammonia and glucose production by mouse renal proximal tubules. Reagents—Glutaminase (grade V) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Sigma (L'Isle d'Abeau Chesnes, France). Other enzymes and coenzymes were supplied by Roche Applied Science (Meylan, France). Superscript II™ reverse transcriptase, platinum Taq polymerase, and dNTPs were obtained from Invitrogen (Pontoise, France). The mRNA extraction kit was purchased from Dynal (Oslo, Norway), and primers were obtained from Genset S.A. (Paris, France). l-[U-14C]Glutamic acid was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). The monoclonal antibody to glutamine synthetase was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mice—Female Swiss mice (OF1; 28–32 g) were obtained from Institut Français de la Fièvre Aphteuse-Centre de Recherche et d'Elevage des Oncins (Saint-Germain-sur-l'Arbresle, France). The animals were fed a standard diet (Usìne d'Alimentation Rationnelle, Villemoissonsur-Orge, France) and either had free access to water or were given 0.28 mol/liter NH4Cl in the drinking water for 48 h. This treatment led to metabolic acidosis as demonstrated by a 3.6-fold increase in total urinary acid excretion (mainly in the form of ammonium ions) determined as described previously (16Conjard A. Brun V. Martin M. Baverel G. Ferrier B. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Preparation of Renal Proximal Tubules and Incubations—Renal proximal tubules were prepared by collagenase treatment of renal cortex slices as described by Conjard et al. (16Conjard A. Brun V. Martin M. Baverel G. Ferrier B. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed for 30 and 60 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath in 12-ml stoppered Erlenmeyer flasks in an atmosphere of O2/CO2 (19:1). Tubules were incubated in 1 ml of Krebs-Henseleit medium with or without various l-amino acids as substrate. The flasks were prepared in duplicate or triplicate for all experimental conditions. Incubation was stopped by adding perchloric acid (3% (v/v) final concentration) to each flask. In all experiments, zero-time flasks with and without substrate were prepared by adding perchloric acid before the tubules. After removal of the denatured protein by centrifugation, the supernatant was neutralized with 20% (w/v) KOH for metabolite determination. Metabolite Assays—Glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, glutamine, alanine, aspartate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, malate, ammonia, and ATP were determined by the methods described by Passonneau and Lowry (17Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press Inc., Totawa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). The protein content of the tubules added to each flask was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (18Redinbaugh M.G. Turley R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Measurement of Enzyme Activities—To measure glutamine synthetase activity, a piece of renal cortex was homogenized at 4 °C at a final concentration of 25 mg/ml tissue fresh weight in an appropriate buffer containing 10 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.5 mm EDTA. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 30 μl of a properly diluted aliquot of the supernatant was used for activity measurement. Glutamine synthetase activity was measured over a 30-min incubation period at 37 °C according to a radioactive method adapted from that of Prusiner and Milner (19Prusiner S. Milner L. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 37: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay contained (final concentrations) 75 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7), 10 mm glutamate, 4 mm NH4Cl, 13 mm MgCl2, 15 mm ATP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 mm phosphocreatine, 13 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 800 Bq of l-[U-14C]glutamic acid (10.5 GBq/mmol) per reaction. Reactions were stopped by heating at 97 °C for 8 min. l-[U-14C]Glutamine was isolated for counting by passing the reaction mixture over an acetate resin (AG® 1-X8, 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad). The eluate was transferred into a counting vial, and 3 ml of UltimaGold® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added for radioactivity measurement in a Tri-Carb® 2100 TR liquid scintillation analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The radioactive [U-14C]glutamic acid used was purified by ion exchange chromatography (acetate resin) to get rid of unspecific 14C-labeled products that may cause some blank. The linearity of activity with time was checked by incubating samples for 15 and 30 min. The relationship of enzyme activity to protein amount (15 and 30 μg) was also linear. Reaction blanks (at zero time or after incubation without ATP) were negligible. Semiquantitative Analysis of Glutamine Synthetase mRNA Expression—To determine the glutamine synthetase and β-actin mRNA levels in the renal cortex from control and acidotic mice, mRNA was extracted, and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described (16Conjard A. Brun V. Martin M. Baverel G. Ferrier B. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A primer pair was selected from the published cDNA sequence of mouse glutamine synthetase (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_008131). The primers were as follows: forward, 5′-AATGGACATGGTGAGCAACC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GTATGGCAGCCTGCAACATT-3′. The number of PCR cycles for glutamine synthetase was 21. The specific primers for glutamine synthetase were included in the PCR mixture at the start of the amplification. After three cycles of amplification, the specific primers for β-actin (16Conjard A. Brun V. Martin M. Baverel G. Ferrier B. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were added, and β-actin cDNA was co-amplified with the glutamine synthetase cDNA for the 18 remaining cycles. The PCR product obtained with the primers specific for glutamine synthetase was sequenced by Genome Express (Grenoble, France) and found to be identical to the published mouse glutamine synthetase sequence. Glutamine synthetase mRNA levels are reported relative to β-actin. Measurement of Glutamine Synthetase Protein Levels in the Mouse Renal Cortex—The glutamine synthetase protein levels in the renal cortex of normal and acidotic mice were measured by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Renal cortical pieces were homogenized in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 300 mm saccharose. Aliquots were heated for 3 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis (25 μg of protein/lane, 12% acrylamide) (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed essentially as described by Kyhse-Andersen (21Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Schleicher & Schüll) according to the manufacturer's instructions and blocked for 60 min in 5% dried skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl). Blots were incubated at room temperature with the primary antibody against glutamine synthetase (1:1000 dilution) for 60 min, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for 60 min, and developed with ECF™ substrate (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min. Bands were visualized with a FluorImager™ and quantified with ImageQuant™ software. Calculations—Net substrate utilization and product formation were calculated as the difference between the total flask contents (tissue plus medium) at the start (zero-time flasks) and after the period of incubation. The metabolic rates, reported as means ± S.E., are expressed in nanomoles of substance removed or produced per mg of tubular protein per unit time (60 min). The results were analyzed by Student's t test for unpaired data, comparing values obtained in control mice with those in 48-h acidotic mice, and only results of p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Table I shows the results of experiments performed to identify, among the physiological amino acids, the potential precursors of glutamine in renal proximal tubules isolated from fed mice. For this, a high nonphysiological concentration (5 mm) of these amino acids was used. In these experiments, tubule viability was indicated by the linearity with time of glutamine and glucose synthesis, two ATP-dependent processes, and by the tubular ATP content (16.1 ± 0.7 μmol/g of protein, n = 4).Table IGlutamine synthesis from various L-amino acids (5 mm) in mouse renal proximal tubulesAmino acidMetabolite production or removal (-)GlutamineGlutamateAmmoniaGlucoseNitrogen foundnmol/mg protein/hNone-5 ± 4-2 ± 3152 ± 1415 ± 2—Glutamate471 ± 24ap < 0.05.—342 ± 79166 ± 6ap < 0.05.1149 ± 125Proline305 ± 25ap < 0.05.338 ± 48ap < 0.05.314 ± 58ap < 0.05.208 ± 10ap < 0.05.1124 ± 50Ornithine84 ± 7ap < 0.05.94 ± 9ap < 0.05.419 ± 34ap < 0.05.38 ± 7ap < 0.05.542 ± 25Alanine78 ± 8ap < 0.05.32 ± 1ap < 0.05.679 ± 55ap < 0.05.71 ± 9ap < 0.05.729 ± 64Aspartate22 ± 3ap < 0.05.158 ± 11ap < 0.05.727 ± 45ap < 0.05.67 ± 6ap < 0.05.791 ± 60Isoleucine10 ± 1ap < 0.05.19 ± 2ap < 0.05.219 ± 4816 ± 5118 ± 40Valine6 ± 2ap < 0.05.17 ± 4ap < 0.05.244 ± 56ap < 0.05.18 ± 5134 ± 50Leucine5 ± 2ap < 0.05.21 ± 6ap < 0.05.399 ± 74ap < 0.05.27 ± 8292 ± 61Arginine4 ± 61 ± 4276 ± 19ap < 0.05.28 ± 1ap < 0.05.145 ± 27Methionine3 ± 317 ± 5ap < 0.05.299 ± 63ap < 0.05.9 ± 2ap < 0.05.183 ± 51Cysteine-3 ± 51 ± 4224 ± 532 ± 2ap < 0.05.80 ± 46Asparagine-7 ± 66 ± 2ap < 0.05.428 ± 22ap < 0.05.11 ± 1ap < 0.05.282 ± 15Histidine-7 ± 6-5 ± 5192 ± 306 ± 2ap < 0.05.35 ± 25a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab The most potent glutamine precursor was glutamate, followed by proline, ornithine, alanine, and aspartate. The other amino acids tested were not converted into glutamine or only at very low rates. Large amounts of glutamate accumulated from proline and, to a lesser extent, from aspartate and ornithine. In the presence of all amino acids, ammonia was produced in amounts substantially greater than those found in the absence of any exogenous amino acid, especially in the presence of aspartate, alanine, asparagine, ornithine, and arginine. Glucose was produced at high rates from proline and glutamate and, to a lesser extent, from alanine, aspartate, ornithine, and arginine. In view of the fact that, among the above glutamine precursors, alanine and proline are present in the circulating blood of the mouse at the highest concentrations, i.e. 0.2–0.6 mm (22Kew S.

Yu H. Grody W.W. Cederbaum S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4491-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we chose these two amino acids as substrates for the next steps of our study. With both 0.5 and 1 mm alanine as substrate, alanine utilization was linear with time for up to 60 min of incubation; alanine utilization was accompanied by glutamine, glucose, and ammonia formation, which was also linear with time over a 60-min incubation period (n = at least 2 for each alanine concentration with tubules from both control and acidotic mice) (data not shown). No substantial amounts of pyruvate, lactate, aspartate, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were found to accumulate in tubules from normal or acidotic mice. Effect of Metabolic Acidosis— Table II shows the results obtained after 60 min of incubation. Metabolic acidosis did not alter the high rate of alanine utilization observed in tubules from control mice with either 0.5 or 1 mm alanine as substrate. By contrast, at both alanine concentrations, the high rate of glutamine synthesis observed in tubules from control mice was dramatically diminished compared with that in tubules from acidotic mice; this effect was accompanied by a statistically significant stimulation of ammonia accumulation only with 1 (but not 0.5) mm alanine as substrate. Acidosis stimulated glucose synthesis especially with 1 mm alanine as substrate. None of the other metabolite tested was produced in substantial amounts from alanine in tubules from either control or acidotic mice. In the absence of alanine, large amounts of ammonia and small amounts of glucose were synthesized from endogenous substrate, and acidosis led to a stimulation of glucose, but not of ammonia production (Table II).Table IIEffect of metabolic acidosis on the metabolism of 0.5 and 1 mm alanine in mouse renal proximal tubulesAcid-base statusMetabolite removal (-) or productionAlanineGlutamineGlutamateAmmoniaGlucoseNitrogen foundnmol/mg protein/h0.5 mm alanineControl (n = 7)-295 ± 3438 ± 58 ± 3371 ± 3546 ± 8455 ± 43Acidotic (n = 6)-297 ± 258 ± 4ap < 0.05.7 ± 3407 ± 3770 ± 3ap < 0.05.428 ± 33NoneControl (n = 7)—1 ± 4-9 ± 4137 ± 1515 ± 2130 ± 21Acidotic (n = 6)—-3 ± 2-5 ± 3188 ± 1926 ± 3ap < 0.05.176 ± 161 mm alanineControl (n = 5)-344 ± 4455 ± 138 ± 4350 ± 4144 ± 5469 ± 60Acidotic (n = 5)-455 ± 3712 ± 6ap < 0.05.13 ± 4538 ± 39ap < 0.05.99 ± 5ap < 0.05.575 ± 33NoneControl (n = 5)—-2 ± 2-13 ± 5137 ± 1813 ± 1120 ± 21Acidotic (n = 5)—-4 ± 3-6 ± 4199 ± 2128 ± 3ap < 0.05.186 ± 25a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab The nitrogen balance calculations given in Table II show that, with 0.5 and 1 mm alanine as substrate and in tubules from both control and acidotic mice, the nitrogen found as glutamine, glutamate, and ammonia (two nitrogen atoms/glutamine molecule and one nitrogen atom/glutamate and ammonia molecules) exceeded by far the amount of nitrogen taken up as alanine (one nitrogen atom/alanine molecule). This clearly indicates that the metabolism of nitrogen observed in the absence of alanine (mainly in the form of ammonia accumulation) still completely occurred in the presence of alanine. As a matter of fact, the alanine uptake was generally in good agreement with the nitrogen found in the presence of alanine minus that found in its absence (Table II). Therefore, to determine the metabolic fate of alanine, the nitrogenous and carbon products found in the absence of alanine were substracted from those found in its presence. Fate of Alanine Carbon and Nitrogen—Given that two alanine molecules are needed to form the carbon skeleton of each glutamate, glutamine, and glucose molecule, it appears that complete oxidation of alanine represented the major fate of alanine carbon under all of the conditions studied (see the carbon balance calculations in Table III); glucose and, except in tubules from acidotic mice, glutamine represented the two other major products of alanine metabolism. Under all experimental conditions, ammonia represented the main nitrogenous product of alanine metabolism, whereas glutamine was a substantial nitrogenous product only in tubules from control mice (Table III).Table IIIEffect of metabolic acidosis on the metabolic fate and pathways of alanine in mouse renal proximal tubulesAcid-base statusAlanine removedDistribution of alanine carbon and nitrogen to:Flux through glutamate dehydrogenaseGlutamineGlutamateAmmoniaGlucoseComplete oxidationnmol/mg protein/h0.5 mm alanineControl (n = 7)295 ± 3437 ± 5 (C, 25%; N, 25%)17 ± 2 (C, 12%; N, 6%)234 ± 29 (N, 79%)32 ± 7 (C, 22%)124 ± 25 (C, 42%)271 ± 29Acidotic (n = 6)297 ± 2511 ± 5ap < 0.05.

Open table in a new tab As for alanine as substrate, the accumulation of glutamine, ammonia, and glucose in tubules from control and acidotic mice was linear with time for a 60-min incubation period with both 0.5 and 1 mm proline (data not shown). Again, no substantial amounts of pyruvate, lactate, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were found to accumulate in tubules from normal or acidotic mice. Negligible amounts of aspartate (1.2 nmol/mg of protein/h, mean value for five experiments) accumulated from 1 mm (but not 0.5 mm) proline in renal proximal tubules from control (but not acidotic) mice. Effect of Metabolic Acidosis— Table IV shows the results obtained in experiments in which tubules from both control and acidotic mice were incubated with 0.5 or 1 mm proline as substrate. As already seen with alanine as substrate, metabolic acidosis markedly reduced the high rates of glutamine synthesis observed with both 0.5 and 1 mm proline. This effect was associated with a stimulation of ammonia accumulation and glucose production at both concentrations of this amino acid. Again, acidosis stimulated the production of glucose (but not ammonia) in the absence of exogenous substrate (Table IV). The total nitrogen found as glutamine, glutamate, and ammonia was not affected by metabolic acidosis with either 0.5 or 1 mm proline, strongly suggesting that proline utilization, like alanine utilization, is not modified by metabolic acidosis.Table IVEffect of metabolic acidosis on the metabolism of 0.5 and 1 mm proline in mouse renal proximal tubulesAcid-base statusMetabolite removal (-) or productionGlutamineGlutamateAmmoniaGlucoseNitrogen foundnmol/mg protein/h0.5 mm prolineControl (n = 8)131 ± 743 ± 6237 ± 3278 ± 8542 ± 30Acidotic (n = 6)17 ± 6ap < 0.05.23 ± 5ap < 0.05.430 ± 44ap < 0.05.122 ± 8ap < 0.05.487 ± 51NoneControl (n = 8)4 ± 3-2 ± 2143 ± 1613 ± 3150 ± 16Acidotic (n = 6)-1 ± 2-7 ± 3172 ± 924 ± 1ap < 0.05.164 ± 121 mm prolineControl (n = 6)221 ± 1081 ± 13211 ± 2598 ± 3734 ± 29Acidotic (n = 5)42 ± 10ap < 0.05.55 ± 7555 ± 41ap < 0.05.186 ± 17ap < 0.05.695 ± 50NoneControl (n = 6)5 ± 3-4 ± 2146 ± 2015 ± 3152 ± 17Acidotic (n = 5)0 ± 2-8 ± 3176 ± 923 ± 1ap < 0.05.168 ± 12a p < 0.05.

Therefore, the accumulation of glutamate and ammonia and the production of glutamine and glucose from proline shown in Table V were calculated as the differences between the values (shown in Table IV) found in the presence and absence of proline.Table VEffect of metabolic acidosis on the metabolic fate and pathways of proline in mouse renal proximal tubulesAcid-base statusProline removedDistribution of proline carbon and nitrogen to:Flux through glutamate dehydrogenaseGlutamineGlutamateAmmoniaGlucoseComplete oxidationnmol/mg protein/h0.5 mm prolineControl (n = 8)392 ± 20127 ± 7 (C, 32%; N, 65%)45 ± 4 (C, 11%; N, 11%)94 ± 23 (N, 24%)65 ± 9 (C, 33%)91 ± 10 (C, 23%)221 ± 21Acidotic (n = 6)323 ± 4118 ± 5ap < 0.05.

Open table in a new tab It can be seen that acidosis did not alter proline utilization (Table V). Glutamine was the main carbon product of proline metabolism in tubules from control (but not acidotic) mice, whereas glucose was the predominant carbon product of proline metabolism in tubules from acidotic mice with both 0.5 and 1 mm proline. Carbon balance calculations revealed that complete oxidation of proline never exceeded 24% of substrate utilization and was not statistically changed by acidosis. The stimulation of glucose synthesis from alanine and proline observed in this study suggested that ammonium chloride acidosis might have reduced the food and water intake in our mice and that fasting might have been responsible, at least in part, for the inhibition of glutamine synthesis also observed in tubules from acidotic mice (Tables II and IV).

https://openalex.org/W2036247086,"JP-45 is a novel integral protein constituent of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum junctional face membrane. We identified its primary structure from a cDNA clone isolated from a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library. Mouse skeletal muscle JP-45 displays over 86 and 50% identity with two hypothetical NCBI data base protein sequences from mouse tongue and human muscle, respectively. JP-45 is predicted to have a cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane segment followed by an intralumenal domain enriched in positively charged amino acids. Northern and Western blot analyses reveal that the protein is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle. The mRNA encoding JP-45 appears in 17-day-old mouse embryos; expression of the protein peaks during the second month of postnatal development and then decreases ∼3-fold during aging. Double immunofluorescence of adult skeletal muscle fibers demonstrates that JP-45 co-localizes with the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with a monoclonal antibody against JP-45 show that JP-45 interacts with the α1.1 subunit voltage-gated calcium channel and calsequestrin. These results are consistent with the localization of JP-45 in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and with its involvement in the molecular mechanism underlying skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum is an intracellular membrane compartment that controls the intracellular calcium concentration and, therefore, plays an important role in excitation-contraction (E-C) 1The abbreviations used are: E-C, excitation-contraction; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; RyR, ryanodine receptor; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescence protein.1The abbreviations used are: E-C, excitation-contraction; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; RyR, ryanodine receptor; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescence protein. coupling (1Fleischer S.

The anatomical site of E-C coupling is the triad, an intracellular synapse formed by the association of two membrane compartments: the transverse tubules, which are an invagination of the plasmalemma, and the terminal cisternae (2Rios E.

Two major protein constituents of the triad membranes have been identified and shown to play a crucial role in E-C coupling: the skeletal muscle voltage-gated calcium channel dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) localized in T-tubule membrane and the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) localized in the sarcoplasmic reticulum junctional face membrane (5Sutko J.L.

Anderson A.A. Ohlendieck K. Froemming G. Guerrini R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we extended our studies and carried out the molecular characterization of JP-45. Our results show that this polypeptide is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and that its level of expression is down-regulated during aging. In addition, we show that it interacts with two key proteins involved in skeletal muscle E-C coupling, namely the α1.1 subunit of the DHPR and calsequestrin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsKeyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugation kit, MPL+TDM adjuvant, CHAPS, and protein G-Sepharose were from Sigma; glutathione-Sepharose 4B, pGex plasmid, nitrocellulose membranes, and [32P]dCTP were from Amersham Biosciences. Goat anti-α 1.1 subunit of the skeletal muscle DHPR polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. RNA isolation kit was from Biotecx Laboratories (Houston, TX). Anti-calsequestrin antibodies were raised in guinea pigs and previously characterized (23Treves S. Vilsen B. Chiozzi P. Andersen J.P. Zorzato F. Biochem.

Mouse skeletal muscle UNI-ZAP XR cDNA library and the cDNA synthesis kit were from Stratagene. Mouse multiple-tissue Northern blot, RNA master blot, and the pEGFP plasmids were from Clontech. All other chemicals were of reagent grade.MethodscDNA Cloning—We isolated and purified total RNA from Balb/c mice skeletal muscles using an RNA isolation kit from Biotecx Laboratories following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Total RNA was converted into cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit from Roche Applied Science using oligo(dT)15 primers, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. To amplify the cDNA specific for JP-45, we first searched the NCBI data base for sequences matching the polypeptide sequences we obtained from rabbit skeletal muscle JP-45 (22Zorzato F. Anderson A.A. Ohlendieck K. Froemming G. Guerrini R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar). The available sequences matched a hypothetical mouse tongue protein (Mus musculus; NCBI accession number AK009578). Based on the primary sequence of this hypothetical protein, we designed a set of primers to amplify the portion of JP-45 encompassing almost all of the peptide sequences we had obtained by tryptic and CNBr digestion of the native protein. The primers used to amplify the cDNA corresponding to JP-45 cDNA were 5′-AGAATTCCCGCCCCCAAGACGCCAAGC-3′ and 5′-AGAATTCACGGCCTTTATTTGCTGGTGC-3′ for forward and reverse reactions, respectively. The EcoRI restriction enzyme sequence was added to facilitate subsequent subcloning. 100 ng of mouse skeletal cDNA were amplified in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp 2400 PCR system under the following conditions: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 40 s annealing at 63 °C, 45 s extension at 72 °C and 30 s denaturation at 92 °C, and a final elongation step of 4 min at 72 °C. The nature and identity of the amplified cDNA was verified by direct sequencing (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland). The PCR-amplified cDNA fragment was labeled and used to screen a mouse skeletal muscle UNI-ZAP XR cDNA library as previously described (24Treves S. Feriotto G. Moccagatta L. Gambari R. Zorzato F. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39555-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Monoclonal Antibody Production—Mouse monoclonal antibodies were generated against a synthetic peptide designed on a sequence derived from a sequence of rabbit skeletal muscle JP-45. The peptide was conjugated to the keyhole-limpet hemocyanin carrier and used to immunize Balb/c mice. Splenocytes from the immunized mice were fused with tissue culture-grown myeloma cells (AGX8) and hybridomas selected in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) medium. Hybridoma cells were identified and tested for the presence of anti-JP-45 antibodies by Western blot analysis on rabbit terminal cisternae (22Zorzato F. Anderson A.A. Ohlendieck K. Froemming G. Guerrini R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar, 25Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleisher S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar).Expression of JP-45 in Mammalian Cells and Tissues—The entire coding sequence of JP-45 was cloned in-frame into the pEGFP-C1 vector by amplifying the cDNA by PCR using the following forward and reverse primers, 5′-AGAATTCTATGACTACCAGAGGCCTGG-3′ and 5′-AGGTACCACACAGGATCAGTC-3′, respectively, under the same conditions as described above. Expression of the recombinant protein was monitored by fluorescence microscopy on COS-7 cells (Lipofectin) transfected either with pEGFP alone or pEGFP-JP-45, using an Axiophot Zeiss fluorescent microscope equipped with NeoFLUAR objective (×63 oil, N.A. = 1.40) as previously described (24Treves S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39555-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Chemical skinning of soleus rat muscles was performed as previously described (26Biral D. Senter L. Salviati G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Single fibers were then isolated under a dissecting microscope, transferred into a Petri dish chamber containing 0.5 ml of a relaxing solution (170 mm K-propionate, 2.5 mm Mg-propionate, 5 mm K2EGTA, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mm K2Na2ATP) and inserted, in a slightly stretched position, between two clamps. The procedure for immunofluorescence staining was initiated by incubating fibers for 1 h in the relaxing solution containing 1% Triton X-100 (RS-T) and 10% goat non-immune serum. All following steps, both washings and incubation with primary or secondary antibodies, were carried out by using the RS-T. Fibers were first incubated for 90 min with the anti-JP 45-kDa antibody (2 μg/ml), washed three times, then incubated for 40 min with the goat anti-mouse IgG TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100) in the presence of 1% rat non-immune serum. After washing, fibers were then incubated with a sheep polyclonal antibody specific for the rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (diluted 1:200). After 90 min, fibers were washed three times and incubated 40 min with goat anti-sheep IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100). After the final wash, fibers were removed from clamps, mounted in an Elvanol solution on glass slides, and observed with a Leica DMRB fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Captured images were analyzed with image processing software (Casti Imaging, Padova, Italy).TSA201 cells with the pEGFP and pEGFP-JP-45 constructs were transfected; 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and crude microsomal membranes prepared by differential centrifugation steps (3,000 × g max, 15,000 × g max, 150,000 × g max). Integral microsomal membrane components were separated from their soluble counterpart by high salt wash (0.6 m KCl) and extraction with 100 Na2CO3 at alkali pH as previously described (11Costello B. Chadwick C. Saito A. Chu A. Maurer A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Microsomes were also prepared from the brain, tongue, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and skeletal muscles of 2-month-old Balb/c mice as well as from the skeletal muscles of 4-day-, 2-month-, 10-month-, and 14.5-month-old Balb/c mice, as described previously (22Zorzato F. Anderson A.A. Ohlendieck K. Froemming G. Guerrini R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar, 24Treves S. Feriotto G. Moccagatta L. Gambari R. Zorzato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39555-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the latter preparations, which were used to examine the changes that occur in JP-45 during development, four different preparations from at least four different mice were used.Electrophoresis and Immunological Staining—SDS-PAGE and indirect immunostaining were carried out as previously described. Protein concentration was determined as described by Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard (22Zorzato F. Anderson A.A. Ohlendieck K. Froemming G. Guerrini R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar, 24Treves S. Feriotto G. Moccagatta L. Gambari R. Zorzato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39555-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Vesicles derived from the light (R1) and heavy (R4) skeletal muscle membrane fractions and from triads were prepared as previously described (25Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleisher S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Proteins were solubilized (at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml) in a buffer composed of 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, and anti-proteases for 30 min at room temperature. Soluble proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then were diluted 10 times with a buffer containing anti-proteases mixture, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and finally incubated with 1 μg of anti-JP-45 monoclonal antibodies for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose previously equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0), 0.001% Tween (TBST) was added to precipitate the immunocomplex.The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The proteins pulled down with JP-45 were detected by immunoblot analysis using a panel of antibodies specific for proteins found in triad membranes.Data Analysis—For group comparison the one-way analysis of variance test was used.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONcDNA Cloning, Sequence Analysis, and Expression of Recombinant JP-45 Protein—To obtain the cDNA encoding JP-45, we matched the amino acid sequence information obtained from the peptides generated by proteolytic treatment of rabbit skeletal muscle JP-45 (22Zorzato F. Anderson A.A. Ohlendieck K. Froemming G. Guerrini R. Treves S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 537-543PubMed Google Scholar) with sequence information available from data bases. Our data matched a hypothetical sequence from mouse (Mus musculus; NCBI accession number AK009578) tongue. Based on the latter nucleotide sequence, we designed a set of primers and amplified a 710-bp cDNA fragment (corresponding to nucleotides 590–1319 of the full-length cDNA encoding JP-45). The nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment matched that of sequence AK009578. The PCR fragment was then 32P-labeled and used to screen under high stringency conditions (three washes at 65 °C, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 × SSCP) a commercially available mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library. Of ∼1 × 106 plaques that were screened, a total of four positive clones were pulled out, plaque-purified, and sequenced (Fig. 1, upper panel, 193C, 193C-1, 193C-3, and 193C-4). Two overlapping clones (193C-1, of 1160 bp, and 193C-3, of 1158 bp) contain an identical open reading frame of 996 bp corresponding to a 332-amino acid-long polypeptide. Both clones 193C-1 and 193C-3 possess 66 nucleotides in the 5′-untranslated region upstream from the first initiation codon. A single polyadenylation signal, AAATAA, is observed 18 nucleotides up-stream from the poly(A)+ tail (not shown).Northern blot analysis of tissues from eight different adult mice revealed a strong hybridizing transcript of ∼1.16 kb only in skeletal muscle; the size of the transcript matches the size of clone 193C-1 (Fig. 2, upper panel). In addition, the transcript encoding JP-45 first appears in 17-day-old embryo mice. Multiple sequence alignment shows that the sequence of the mouse skeletal muscle cDNA clone encodes a protein that displays 86 and 50% identity with hypothetical proteins from mouse tongue and human muscle (Fig. 1, lower panel). The NH2-terminal sequence of mouse skeletal muscle JP-45 is similar to its human counterpart but diverges from that of mouse tongue. The mouse skeletal muscle JP-45 and the hypothetical tongue protein are identical from Val at position 54 until the end of the protein. The peptide sequence obtained from proteolytic treatment of rabbit skeletal muscle JP-45 that was used to generate the anti-JP-45 mAb is localized at the COOH-terminal part of the proteins and displays 71 and 50% identity with the corresponding mouse and human sequences, respectively.Fig. 2Tissue and embryological expression of JP-45.

Transmembrane prediction analysis (TMpred, www.ch.EMBnet.org) suggests the possibility of one transmembrane domain, between residues 126–148, which is 100 and 91% identical to the hypothetical mouse tongue and human muscle sequences, respectively. We confirmed that JP-45 is an integral membrane protein by cellular and biochemical approaches. When COS-7 cells were transfected with the pEGFP-JP-45 construct, the green fluorescence was excluded from the nuclei and showed a pattern of fluorescence compatible with its distribution within intracellular membranes (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, when cells were transfected with the empty pEGFP vector, the fluorescence was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nuclei (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with localization of the recombinant EGFP-JP-45 fusion protein in the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum membrane. The conclusion is also supported by Western blot analysis of KCl-washed, sodium carbonate-treated membrane fraction isolated by differential centrifugation from TSA201 cells transfected with pEGFP-JP-45. A band having a molecular mass of about 70 kDa (27 kDa corresponding to the mass of GFP, plus 45 kDa corresponding to the apparent mass of JP-45) was immunodecorated with anti-GFP (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2) and anti-JP-45 antibodies (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4) and is clearly present in the membranes after Na2CO3 extraction (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4) and absent from the soluble fraction (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 3). This result is consistent with the conclusion that the punctuated fluorescent pattern of living COS-7 is not because of aggregates of denatured recombinant protein within ER membranes. TSA201 cells transfected with the empty pEGFP vector display an immunoreactive band of ∼27 kDa only in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3D, lane 1).Fig. 3Cellular distribution of JP-45. A and B, cells were examined for GFP fluorescence with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope using a ×63 NeoFLUOR objective (1.4 N.A., excitation 480 nm; magnification ×1000). C and D, microsomes from TSA201 cells transfected with the pEGFP-JP-45 and pEGFP plasmids were washed with high salt and 100 mm Na2CO3. Soluble proteins and proteins loosely associated with the membranes (lanes 1 and 3) were separated from integral membrane proteins (lanes 2 and 4) by differential centrifugation. 20 μg of protein were loaded per lane, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-GFP antibodies (panels C and D, lanes 1 and 2) or anti-JP-45 antibodies (panel C, lanes 3 and 4). Right panels, double immunofluorescence staining of chemically skinned single fibers from rat soleus muscle with the monoclonal anti-JP-45 antibody (JP45), a polyclonal anti-RyR antibody (RYR). The merged image (merge) shows the overlap of the staining of the two antibodies. Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To localize JP-45 in native muscle fibers, we performed double immunofluorescence experiments on adult rat muscle fibers using our anti-JP-45 monoclonal antibodies and commercially available anti-RyR receptor antibodies. Staining with either antibody shows a typical triadic striation pattern (Fig. 3, right panels, JP45 and RyR). The merged image supports the view that JP-45 and ryanodine receptor co-localize in triad membranes.Mouse skeletal muscle JP-45 contains 112 charged amino acid residues of a total of 332; the lumenal domain alone contains 76 (of 112) charged residues, 47 of which are basic and 30 acidic, giving the polypeptide a predicted pI of 9.77. The higher apparent molecular mass of the JP-45 observed in the Laemmli gel system could be because of the basic nature of the protein, as already described for triadin, another basic SR protein. The protein contains eight putative protein kinase As, three protein kinase Cs, and five CaMKII phosphorylation sites.Tissue Distribution and Developmental Expression of JP-45— To investigate the tissue distribution at the protein level we used the monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the rabbit skeletal muscle JP-45 sequence (Fig. 1B, RabbitSk-Muscpep). It should be pointed out that this mAb immunodecorated a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing the COOH-terminal domain of the mouse skeletal muscle JP-45 (not shown), indicating that its epitope is shared by the rabbit and mouse proteins. The presence of the JP-45 protein product in the microsomal fractions from different mouse tissues was verified by Western blot analysis. An immunoreactive band is present in total mouse microsomal membranes isolated from skeletal muscle and tongue (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 13) but absent from microsomal membranes of kidney, spleen, liver, heart, and brain (Fig. 4A, lanes 9–12 and 14, respectively).Fig. 4Western blot analysis showing tissue distribution and developmental expression of JP-45 protein.

Four separate SR preparations from at least four different animals of each age group were made and their content of JP-45 assessed. A clear increase in the total content of JP-45 was shown during the early phase of postnatal development, and the amount of protein peaks at ∼2 months (Fig. 4B) and thereafter in 14.5-month-old mice decreases 3.2-fold (analysis of variance p <0.0036) (Fig. 4C). The average mouse life span is 2 years; thus, it appears that JP-45 is down-regulated during aging of mouse skeletal muscle (27Kempermann G. Gast D. Gage H. Ann.

https://openalex.org/W2061084405,"The crystal structure of acutohaemolysin, a lysine 49 phospholipase A2 protein with 1010 non-hydrogen protein atoms and 232 water molecules, has been determined ab initio using the program SnB at an ultrahigh resolution of 0.8 Å. The lack of catalytic activity appears to be related to the presence of Phe102, which prevents the access of substrate to the active site. The substitution of tryptophan for leucine at residue 10 interferes with dimer formation and may be responsible for the additional loss of hemolytic activity. The ultrahigh resolution of the experimental diffraction data permits alternative conformations to be modeled for disordered residues, many hydrogen atoms to be located, the protonation of the Nϵ2 atom in the catalytic residue His48 to be observed experimentally, and the density of the bonding electrons to be analyzed in detail.

Phospholipase A2 (PLA2, 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; r.m.s., root mean square.1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; r.m.s., root mean square. EC 3.1.1.4) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the sn-2 fatty aryl bond of phospholipids to produce free fatty acid and lysophospholipids (1Ownby C.L. Selistre de Araujo H.S. White S.P. Fletcher J.E. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 411-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although PLA2s from different species share similar structures, they show diverse pharmacological and toxicological functions, including myotoxicity, anticoagulant activity, hemolyticity, and lipolysticity (2Arni R.K.

Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Accurate atomic resolution crystal structures are required to answer questions concerning the possible structural basis for these biological functions. According to conventional wisdom, the catalytic activity of PLA2s depends on the binding of a calcium ion and on the presence of residue Asp49 (4Francis B. Gutiérrez J.M. Leomonte B. Kaiser I.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). (The conventional numbering system of Renetseder et al. (5Renetseder R. Brunie S. Dijkstra B.W. Drenth J. Sigler P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11627-11636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is used throughout this report.) The substitution of other residues for Asp49 eliminates the binding of calcium ion and is thought to abolish catalytic activity (6Gutiérrez J.M. Lomonte B. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 1405-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, the side-chain Nζ atom of lysine residues can play a role similar to that of a calcium ion, thereby enabling Lys49 PLA2s to display noticeable catalytic activity (7Pedersen J.Z. Lomonte B.

Lys49 PLA2s are abundant in snake venoms from various species, and they share highly homologous sequences and three-dimensional structures as evidenced by four crystal structures determined at a resolution of 2.0 Å or lower (2Arni R.K.

The crystal structure determination of this protein was undertaken to investigate the structural basis of its inactivity, and the results indicate that specific substitutions at residues 10 and 102 may be responsible for this loss. Because the acutohaemolysin crystals diffracted extremely well, it was possible to measure x-ray data at the ultrahigh resolution of 0.80 Å and to solve the structure using the ab initio dual-space direct method that is known as Shake-and-Bake (12Weeks C.M. DeTitta G.T. Hauptman H.A. Thuman P. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and implemented in the computer program SnB (13Miller R. Gallo S.M. Khalak H.G. Weeks C.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1994; 27: 613-621Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This structure, which contains ∼1250 non-hydrogen atoms, is one of the largest ever determined by direct methods. The atomic coordinates for acutohaemolysin have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1MC2. In recent years, several methodological improvements, including cryogenic crystal mounting techniques, bright synchrotron x-ray sources, and highly sensitive area detectors, have made the measurement of ultrahigh resolution diffraction data more feasible. This is important because high resolution studies provide much more detailed and accurate information than that obtainable from structures determined in the range of 2–3 Å. For example, in the acutohaemolysin case, each atom can be described by nine parameters, including three coordinates and six thermal factors, that express the anisotropic nature of the thermal motion, and this permits the solvent molecules to be divided into two hydration shells. In addition, atomic resolution difference electron density maps allow the positions of a large number of hydrogen atoms, including those involved in interactions among active-site residues, to be located (15Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Moreover, alternative or multiple conformations of some disordered residues can be resolved and modeled. When ultrahigh resolution (e.g. better than 0.9 Å) crystallographic diffraction data are available, the deformation of the atomic electron density due to chemical bonding can be observed (16Jelsch C. Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Aubry A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1306-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following a refinement using a spherical atom model, residual maps may reveal additional information about chemical bonding and electron transfer between atoms. At subatomic resolutions (d ∼ 0.5 Å), the experimental molecular charge density can be precisely refined using a multipolar electron density model (17Hansen N.K. Coppens P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 909-921Crossref Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Multipolar density can be decomposed into three contributions: the core spherical density, the valence spherical density, and the valence non-spherical density. Such information is important for deriving the overall electrostatic potential distribution in protein structures (18Coppens P. X-ray Charge Densities and Chemical Bonding.

Blessing R.H. Coppens P. Tobard A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6942-6949Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is often asserted that charge density analyses are restricted to diffraction data from crystals of small molecules (24Coppens P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1998; 54: 779-788Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, however, it has been demonstrated that charge density refinement for biological macromolecules can also be carried out if the diffraction resolution is high enough and if the atomic thermal motion is sufficiently low. For example, the application of charge density refinement to the structure of a scorpion protein at 0.96Å resolution showed visible bonding density between some main-chain atoms (21Housset D. Benabicha F. Pichon-Pesme V. Jelsch C. Maierhofer A. David S. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Lecomte C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The best example of charge density analysis applied to biological macromolecules, however, is provided by exhaustive refinement, at the ultrahigh resolution of 0.54 Å, of the valence electron distribution in crambin, a small protein with 46 residues (22Jelsch C. Teeter M.M. Lamzin V. Pichon-Pesme V. Blessing R.H. Lecomte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3171-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Herein we report the results of a charge density analysis applied to acutohaemolysin. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection—Acutohaemolysin was purified and crystallized using previously reported procedures (25Huang Q.Q. Zhu X.Y. Li N. Deng W.H. Chen T.B. Rao P.F. Teng M.K. Niu L.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Crystals with a size of ∼0.8 × 0.8 × 1.0 mm were soaked in a 0.05 m sodium citrate solution (pH 5.6) containing 18%(v/v) isopropanol, 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 5% (v/v) glycerol and then subjected to cryogenic flash freezing. Diffraction data were collected from cryo-protected crystals, under a nitrogen stream at a temperature of 100 K, at beamline 19-ID of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne). The wavelength of the incident x-rays was set to 0.92 Å to meet the requirements for ultrahigh resolution data collection. A total of 600 frames was recorded from one crystal with different exposure time to cover all of the reciprocal space at both low and high resolution. Data processing was performed using the program HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar), and the statistics of data collection and processing are summarized in Table I. The cryo-protected crystals of acutohaemolysin belong to space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 44.743 Å, b = 59.100 Å, c = 45.319 Å, and β = 117.421°. These dimensions are slightly shorter than those observed under room temperature conditions. The agreement factor R merge and the data completeness were 5.5% and 76.7%, respectively, for all resolution shells, and the corresponding values were 27% and 34.7% for the highest resolution shell (0.83–0.80 Å). An average isotropic thermal factor (B) of 5.6 Å2, a relatively small value for a protein data set, was estimated from a Wilson plot using data in the range 4.0–0.8 Å.Table ISummary of data collection, structure refinement, and validationData collectionSpace groupC2Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)44.742, 59.090, 45.319α, β, γ (°)90.0, 117.421, 90.0Resolution ranges (Å)20.0-0.8Temperature (K)100Number of observations384,478Number of unique reflections84,242Overall completeness (%)aCompleteness is the ratio of the number of observed reflections to the number of possible reflections.76.6 (34.7)bThe values for the data in the highest resolution shell (0.83-0.80 Å) are shown in parentheses.R merge (%)cR merge = ΣhklΣj|I(hkl)j - 〈I(hkl)〉|/Σhkl Σj I(hkl)j.

Biol. 1996; 264: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Phasing by Direct Methods—Initial phases were obtained using the direct methods program SnB version 2.1 (14Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar). First, normalized structure-factor magnitudes (E values) in the resolution range 8–0.8 Å were calculated using the LEVY/EVAL programs in the SnB package (27Blessing R.H. Guo D.Y. Langs D.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and then 107,100 triplet structure invariants were generated using the 10,710 strongest E values. Next, trial structures consisting of 300 randomly positioned atoms (S17, C283) were created, and each of them was subjected to 1,071 cycles of dual-space Shake-and-Bake refinement that included parameter shift optimization of the minimal function (R min) and selection of 300 new peaks in each cycle (12Weeks C.M. DeTitta G.T. Hauptman H.A. Thuman P. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Three figures of merit (i.e. R min, a crystallographic R factor, and a correlation coefficient between E obs and E calc (28Fujinaga M. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 517-521Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar)) were calculated for each trial, and a histogram of the R min values examined following completion of refinement for the 16th trial suggested that a solution had been found. After 140 cycles, a trace of the R min values versus SnB cycle number showed a sudden drop (characteristic of a solution) resulting in a decrease of R min from an initial value of 0.48 to a stable value of 0.439. Trial 16 was refined for 107 more dual space cycles while selecting the 964 strongest peaks in each cycle, and a final 107 cycles of Fourier refinement alone were performed while slowly increasing the number of reflections phased from 10,710 to 43,457 (i.e. all reflections with E were >0.75). The final R min, crystallographic R-factor, and correlation coefficient values were 0.443, 0.32, and 0.66, respectively. Structural Model Building and Refinement—To avoid lower ranking peaks that might be spurious, only the strongest 500 peaks were then input to unconstrained free-atom refinement using SHELXL (29Sheldrick, G. M. (1997) The SHELX-97 Manual, Göttingen UniversityGoogle Scholar). The highest 17 peaks were assigned to be sulfur atoms, and the remaining peaks were assigned as oxygen atoms. Refinement continued until there was no further decrease in the crystallographic R factor, which converged to a value of 0.25 after 100 cycles. Next, the main chain was built automatically by the program ARP/wARP (30Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) using diffraction data between 20 and 1.0 Å. The Connectivity Index increased steadily from 0.80 to 0.97 after 50 cycles of model building, indicating that a successful main-chain tracing had been found. Except for a few hydrophilic residues at the molecular surface, it was very easy to recognize and build almost all side chains based on both 2F obs – F calc and F obs – F calc maps. Hydrophilic residues with poor electron density were assigned according to a cDNA clone from the same species (31Fan C.Y. Qian Y.C. Yang S.L. Gong Y. Genetic Analysis. 1999; 15: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The crystallographic R factor of the model built in this way dropped to a value of 22% without including any solvent molecules. Further refinement with the SHELX package was performed with cross-validation using 5% of the observed reflections that were selected at random. Using data in the resolution range 10–1.2 Å, the model was first refined to convergence with an R factor of 22.0% and an R free factor of 24.0%. Then, water molecules were added gradually. Using the instruction STIR 1.3 0.02, the upper resolution limit was gradually expanded to 1.0 Å. Both the electron density map and the model were inspected carefully, and the model was adjusted to fit the density using the program O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 109-110Google Scholar). Thereafter, all reflections were used, and, after addition of more water, the resolution was extended to 0.8 Å yielding R and R free values of 18.91% and 20.08%, respectively. Subsequent refinements were carried out by introducing anisotropic thermal parameters for all atoms except for the water molecules. This adjustment gave a sharp decrease in both R and R free (13.98% and 14.96%, respectively). At this point, alternative conformations could be modeled for disordered residues using 2F obs – F calc maps as well as clues in the diagnostic table output by SHELXL. For these modeled conformations, the initial B factors of all side-chain atoms were reset to an isotropic value of 10 Å2, the occupancies of the main conformers were fixed at 0.66, and atoms with isotropic and anisotropic B factors were refined alternately. Altogether, alternative conformations for nine residues were modeled. At this stage, the R value was 10.72%, and the R free value was 12.63%. Distance restraints were applied during all refinements; the allowed standard deviations from the distance targets was of 0.02 Å for covalent bonds and 0.04 Å for atoms linked by two bonds. Near the end of refinement, the addition of riding hydrogen atoms based on stereo-chemical requirements further reduced R and R free to 9.21% and 12.1%, respectively. Experimental Charge Density Refinement—Charge density refinement for acutohaemolysin was carried out using the program MOPRO (33Guillot B. Viry L. Guillot R. Lecomte C. Jelsch C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 214-223Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar), an extension of the program MOLLY (16Jelsch C. Pichon-Pesme V. Lecomte C. Aubry A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1306-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for biological macromolecules. This program is able to refine large structures with the use of conjugate gradient iterations, and the sparse matrix principle was applied to the least squares method. A common difficulty in charge density refinement is the separation of the anisotropic mean square displacements of the atoms from the static molecular electron distribution. The proper experimental deconvolution requires very accurate diffraction data to ultrahigh resolution (e.g. 0.4–0.6 Å). The contribution of the bonding electron density to the diffraction does not go beyond 0.8 Å (23Lecomte C. Blessing R.H. Coppens P. Tobard A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 6942-6949Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but scattering by the core electrons, located close to the atomic nuclei, extends to 0.5 Å or better depending on the size of the atomic thermal factors. Therefore, in small molecules, charge density analyses as well as accurate atomic positional and thermal parameters are obtained by a high order refinement where only reflections in the upper resolution ranges are taken into account. In the case of acutohaemolysin, the starting structure for charge density studies was the final model obtained from the SHELXL refinement. Only the atoms with a B eq factor lower than 9 Å2 were allowed to vary in the high order MOPRO refinement, and the stereo-chemical restraints that were applied were similar to those used in SHELXL. MOPRO enables the application of reflection weights that depend on the experimental intensity I H, on its uncertainty σI, and on the resolution d. The W H weighting scheme results in reflections at high resolution that are overweighted, as in Equation 1. WH=(2σI2+0.001IH2)-1/2d-2(Eq. 1) Using this weighting scheme, the charge density could be partially retrieved for regions of the protein with low thermal motion. When a spherical atom model was used, a residual map revealed the non-modeled deformation of the electron density after high order refinement. Coordinates and anisotropic displacement parameters were not refined simultaneously but, rather, in successive refinement cycles. The Scale factor and solvent correction parameters were regularly refined using a different weighting scheme, WH'=(2σI2+0.001IH2)1/2(Eq. 2) which was independent of the resolution. Refinement using all diffraction data and both weighting schemes (until convergence of the positional and thermal parameters was achieved) resulted in a final R-factor of 15%. This relatively high value was due to overweighting of the upper resolution reflections during the refinement. Model Quality and Stereochemical Parameters—The structure of acutohaemolysin contains 1010 non-hydrogen protein atoms, 2 isopropanol molecules, and 232 water molecules, and it was refined to a crystallographic R factor of 9.21% (for data with F > 4σF) or 10.52% (for all data). Fourier maps clearly revealed the atomicity of the electron density, and non-hydrogen protein atoms (i.e. C, N, and O) could be easily differentiated, because the heavier atoms have a larger spherical radius of density. Moreover, peaks accounting for 428 hydrogen atoms were observed on difference Fourier maps, thereby indicating that the refined model is of high quality. The stereochemical parameters of the model were analyzed by the use of programs PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), WHATCHECK (35Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 391: 272Crossref Scopus (1804) Google Scholar), and PROVE (36Pontius J. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and the results are shown in Table I. The main-chain dihedral angles of all non-glycine and non-proline residues lie in the preferred and allowed regions (91.6% and 8.4%, respectively) of the Ramachandran diagram (37Ramachandran G.N. Ramakrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar), and the standard deviations of the bond lengths and bond angles (0.018 Å and 2.3°, respectively) are reasonable. The overall average G factor of 0.03 computed by PROCHECK is very close to its theoretic value of zero, and this is another indication of the excellent overall quality of the model. All root-mean-square (r.m.s.) Z scores are close to 1.0 except for those of the bond angles and side-chain planarity. The poor r.m.s. Z scores for these two quantities might be the result of the relatively low quality of the standard parameters used by WHATCHECK. In addition, the standard deviations of the stereochemical parameters were also estimated directly from the experimental data by inversion of the full normal matrix (38Dauter Z. Lamzin V S. Wilson K.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the parameter uncertainties determined in this way are listed in Table I as well. Matrix inversion and the statistical program WHATCHECK give almost the same values for the standard deviations of the bond lengths, but they give quite different values for the standard deviations of the bond angles and the main-chain ω dihedral angles. The differences are 1.08° and 4.77°, respectively, indicating that the stereochemical parameters currently used in structural validation are not appropriate, especially for ultrahigh resolution data, and that the ω angles in protein structures may possess a wider range than the usually accepted values. The structure of acutohaemolysin refined with ultrahigh resolution diffraction data could be a candidate for deriving better structural parameters for validation. Overall Structure—The amino acid residues of acutohaemolysin were sequenced from the crystallographic electron density, and the identities of the 27 N-terminal residues were determined by Edman degradation as well (25Huang Q.Q. Zhu X.Y. Li N. Deng W.H. Chen T.B. Rao P.F. Teng M.K. Niu L.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These results were found to be in agreement with the sequence of a cDNA clone of unknown functions from the same species (31Fan C.Y. Qian Y.C. Yang S.L. Gong Y. Genetic Analysis. 1999; 15: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The excellent model-to-density fitting of residue Lys49 clearly shows that acutohaemolysin is a member of the Lys49 PLA2 family instead of the Asp49 or Ser49 PLA2 families. A comparison of the primary structures of acutohaemolysin and four other Lys49 PLA2 structures shows a high degree of homology (Fig. 1). In common with other Lys49 PLA2 structures, acutohaemolysin consists of three α helices, two anti-parallel β strands, and a few connecting loops (Fig. 2). Two long α helices inter-locked by two pairs of disulfide bonds (Cys44-Cys105 and Cys51-Cys98) constitute a rigid platform that stabilizes the overall structure. Other elements of secondary structure are attached directly or indirectly to this platform by five additional disulfide bonds. Compared with the other Lys49 PLA2 structures (Fig. 3), the two regions of acutohaemolysin with the greatest conformational variation are the C-terminal loop where a serine residue is inserted at position 131 and the so-called calcium-binding loop containing residues 25–35.Fig. 3Superimposed line representations of acutohaemolysin and four other Lys49 PLA2s illustrate a highly conse"
https://openalex.org/W2143670846,"A novel human cytosolic flavin reductase, Nr1, was recently described that contains FMN, FAD, and NADPH cofactors. Though the targets of the related NADPH-dependent flavoprotein reductases, cytochrome P450 reductase, methionine synthase reductase, and nitric oxide synthase, are known, the cellular function of Nr1 is not clear. To explore expression and regulation of Nr1, we cloned fre-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of Nr1, and discovered that it is transcribed as a bicistronic pre-mRNA together with dcs-1, the ortholog of the recently described scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme. We used the novel substrate, 7meGpppBODIPY, to demonstrate that DCS-1 has low micromolar specificity for guanine ribonucleotides with the 7me modification, whereas trimethylated G substrates are poor competitors. Contrary to earlier classification, DCS-1 is not a pyrophosphatase but a distant member of the Hint branch of the histidine triad superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that DCS-1 homologs may function in the metabolism of capped oligonucleotides generated following exosome-dependent degradation of short-lived mRNA transcripts. We find that fre-1 and dcs-1 are coordinately expressed through worm development, are induced by heat shock, and have a nearly identical expression profile in human tissues. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis of the endogenous proteins in COS cells indicates that both are present in the nucleus and concentrated in a distinct perinuclear structure. Though no connection between these enzymes had been anticipated, our data and data from global expression and protein association studies suggest that the two enzymes jointly participate in responses to DNA damage, heat shock, and other stresses.

Determination of the cellular and biochemical specificities of thousands of newly described enzymes is a major problem of post-genomic biology.

CPRs are endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzymes that serve to maintain cytochrome P450s and heme oxygenases in the reduced active state (6Ding S. Yao D. Deeni Y.Y. Burchell B. Wolf C.R. Friedberg T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 613-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NOS mediates the synthesis of NO from arginine in the immune, vascular, and nervous systems (7Vincent S.

A novel cytoplasmic reductase named Nr1 was recently described that binds FMN, FAD, and NADPH cofactors and is highly expressed in human cancer cells (9Paine M.J. Garner A.P. Powell D. Sibbald J.

The substrates and biological pathways involving this enzyme are unknown. Histidine triad (HIT) enzymes are a superfamily of nucleoside monophosphate hydrolases and nucleoside monophosphate transferases named for an active site sequence related to His-[phis]-His-[phis]-His-[phis]-[phis] ([phis] is a hydrophobic amino acid) in which the nucleoside monophosphate portion of substrates becomes covalently linked to the second His in the first step of the reaction (10Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Branches 1 and 2 of the HIT superfamily are hydrolases. Branch 3 enzymes include transferases such as galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. The most well understood branch 1 enzymes are rabbit Hint and baker's yeast Hnt1, which hydrolyze the adenosine 5′-monophosphoramide substrate, AMP-lysine (11Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Losses in Hnt1 lead to yeast cells that are hypersensitive to mutations in Kin28 and other components of general transcription factor TFIIH (11Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which has lead to the hypothesis that a post-translationally modified form of Cdk7/Kin28 may be a lysyl-adenylylated protein substrate of Hint (10Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In birds, Hint and an apparent Hint inhibitor, Asw, are encoded on the Z and W sex chromosomes, respectively, suggesting that Asw-mediated inhibition of Hint may play a role in female avian development (12Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Branch 2 enzymes consist of the human tumor suppressor Fhit (13Ohta M. Inoue H. Cotticelli M.G. Kastury K. Baffa R. Palazzo J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Human Dcps (scavenger decapping enzyme) was recently purified and cloned as an enzyme that hydrolyzes compounds such as 7meGpppG and small capped oligoribonucleotides and was proposed to function in the hydrolysis of short oligomers that remain after 3′ to 5′-exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA (18Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Deletion of DCS1 from baker's yeast showed that the enzyme has 7meGpppG-hydrolase activity in vivo (18Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, the homologous enzyme (Nhm1) was co-purified with the mRNA cap-binding complex eukaryotic initiation factor-4F (19Salehi Z. Geffers L. Vilela C. Birkenhager R. Ptushkina M. Berthelot K. Ferro M. Gaskell S. Hagan I. Stapley B. McCarthy J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we identify fre-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of the human Nr1 NADPH-dependent flavin reductase, as the second gene in a two-gene operon with C. elegans dcs-1. Biochemical analysis with a newly synthesized 7meGpppBODIPY substrate and structure-based sequence analysis of DCS-1 indicate that DCS-1 homologs are a new sub-branch of HIT hydrolases (Hint branch) with a 7meGMP-binding pocket in place of the AMP-binding pocket of Hint and Fhit. In dcs-1:fre-1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic worms, the dcs-1:fre-1 promoter directs expression to neurons and pharyngeal muscle and is induced by heat shock. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the two genes in worms and humans indicates that they are co-regulated in time and tissue across phyla. Immunocytochemistry indicates that these two proteins are found together in the nucleus and in a distinct perinuclear structure in COS cells. Expression data suggest that the two enzymes jointly participate in responses to DNA damage, heat shock, and other stresses. Cloning and Characterization of Worm Transcripts—Cultures of C. elegans (Bristol N2) were grown and maintained as described (20Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA, prepared from a mixed population of wild type hermaphrodites, was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers followed by PCR using gene-specific oligonucleotides 1 and 2 for fre-1 and 3 and 4 for dcs-1. Full-length cDNAs were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Trans-splicing specificity was assessed by performing RT-PCR with SL1 and SL2 as the 5′-primers and primers 2 and 4 as the 3′-primers as described (21Zorio D.A. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To examine developmental expression patterns, RNA was isolated from synchronized N2 nematodes cultured at 20 °C and RT-PCR was performed using the primers for fre-1 and dcs-1, along with primers 5 and 6 for the S-adenosyl l-homocysteine hydrolase (AHH) gene, whose mRNA abundance is unchanged throughout development. 2C. Thacker, unpublished results. For expression analysis by RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was subjected to 35 cycles of amplification with an annealing temperature of 59 °C. The same primers were used for RT-PCR analysis of worms subjected to a two-hour, 33 °C heat shock.

This fragment, digested with XbaI and SmaI (sites engineered in the primers), was introduced into GFP expression vector pPD95.70 (23Miller III, D.M. Desai N.S. Hardin D.C. Piston D.W. Patterson G.H. Fleenor J. Xu S. Fire A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was injected at 10 μg/μl along with plin-15 containing the wild type lin-15 gene at 50 ng/μl and pBlueScript KS at 50 ng/μl into the gonad arms of lin-15 (n765ts) adult hermaphrodites as described (24Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals were identified by rescue of the lin-15 (n765ts) multivulval phenotype at 20 °C, and stable lines were isolated. Cell identification was based on the characteristic morphology and position of GFP-positive nuclei viewed by simultaneous fluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy. Cloning and Characterization of Human Transcripts—Human Nr1 (primers 9 and 10) and Dcps (primers 11 and 12) cDNAs were amplified from placental total RNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into pCR2.1. Using the same primers, PCR-based expression analysis was performed with a panel of human cDNAs (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purification of Recombinant DCS-1—Worm dcs-1 was cloned into pSGA04 (25Ghosh S. Lowenstein J.M. Gene. 1997; 176: 249-255Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using primers 13 and 14 to express a His-tagged polypeptide after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The resulting plasmid pB344 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 and grown in Luria Bertani broth with 150 μg/ml ampicillin. A 2-liter culture was grown at 30 °C to an A600 nm of 0.4. After addition of IPTG to 0.4 mm, cells were shaken an additional 7 h. The washed, frozen, and thawed cell pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 1 mm imidazole with two tablets of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication. Clarified lysate was loaded onto a 10-ml nickelnitrilotriacetic acid column (Sigma) and washed with six column volumes of the same buffer with 40 mm imidazole and two column volumes with 50 mm imidazole. DCS-1 was eluted using a gradient of imidazole from 50 to 200 mm. Homogeneous enzyme was concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm K·HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2% glycerol and frozen at -80 °C. Synthesis of 7meGpppBODIPY—The critical precursor, 7meGTPγS, was synthesized enzymatically by a modification of procedures used to synthesize other thio-substituted nucleoside triphosphates (26Goody R. Eckstein F. Schirmer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Buczynski G. Potter R. Biochim. Biophys.

Briefly, 10 mm 7meGDP and 2 mm ATPγS were incubated in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, with 50 units of nucleoside diphosphate kinase at 30 °C for 2 h in a 1-ml reaction volume. The 7meGTPγS product was isolated by RP-HPLC, with a 5-μm ODS Hypersil column (Alltech) using 0.1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4 (Buffer B, 0.1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate plus 40% CH3CN). At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, a 30-min cycle consisted of 24 min from 0 to 20% Buffer B, 3 min for 20-100%, and 3 min 100-0%. Under these conditions, 7meGTPγS was eluted at 19.78 min. 7meGpppBODIPY was synthesized and purified as described for GpppBODIPY (29Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), i.e. by reacting 7meGTPγS with N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacine-3-yl)methyl)iodoacetamide in dioxane. Enzymatic Assays—To determine kinetic parameters, duplicate or triplicate assays were performed at 30 °C in 40 mm K·HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2 in total volumes of 20 μl with six or seven substrate concentrations ranging from 0.31 to 20 μm for 7mGpppBODIPY and 1.25-40 μm for GpppBODIPY and ApppBODIPY. In initial rate assays, the amount of enzyme varied from 0.1 to 0.55 pmol for 7meGpppBODIPY, 2.47-6.3 pmol for GpppBODIPY, and 4.39-11 pmol for ApppBODIPY. Reactions samples were spotted on silica TLC plates (Merck) at 60-120 s intervals. Plates were developed in 2-propanol:NH4OH:1,4-dioxane:H2O (50:33:6:11), imaged with a Typhoon 9400 (Amersham Biosciences) (excitation 488 nm, emission 520 nm), and quantitated using ImageQuant 5.2 software. To determine the K i of nonlabeled competitor nucleotides, these compounds were titrated into 20 μl of complete hydrolysis reactions containing 1.25 μm 7meGpppBODIPY and 0.27 pmol enzyme. Using methods established earlier with Fhit and GpppBODIPY (29Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), K i values of the nonlabeled nucleotides were determined from the concentration-dependence of reduction of k cat/K m(apparent) for 7meGpppBODIPY. Antibodies and Immunocytochemistry—Antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides derived from human Nr1 (amino acids 197-207) and Dcps (amino acids 181-195), conjugated to KLH, and affinity-purified using the peptide antigens. In Western blots of protein from COS and HEK cells or mouse brain, the antibodies recognized bands of the predicted size for Nr1 (68 kDa) and Dcps (38 kDa). For immunocytochemistry, COS cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with the antibodies at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Following washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antisera (The Jackson Laboratories), counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Homologs of Human NADPH-dependent Flavin Reductase and Scavenger Decapping Enzyme Are Encoded on a Two-gene Operon in Worms—We examined the inventory of predicted flavoprotein reductases in the worm genome (30The C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3587) Google Scholar) and discovered homologs of CPR (accession number NP_498103), MSR (accession number NP_495978), and Nr1 (accession number 6425246), the latter of which we named fre-1. As shown in Fig. 1, the predicted 585-amino acid fre-1 polypeptide conserves sequences defined to bind FMN, FAD, and NADPH but lacks the N-terminal hydrophobic sequences that anchor CPR to the endoplasmic reticulum, the N-terminal heme-binding oxidase domain found in NOS, and the central sequences that are diagnostic for MSR. Just 180 nucleotides upstream of the fre-1 initiator codon, we located the stop codon of the ortholog of human scavenger decapping enzyme Dcps, which we name dcs-1. Approximately 15% of worm genes occur in operons of two to eight genes (31Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nature Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 110-118Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In these cases, pre-mRNAs are formed containing multiple cistrons that are cleaved and polyadenylylated. In all known cases in which there is an intercistronic length of greater than a few nucleotides, the downstream genes are trans-spliced with the downstream gene-specific SL2 RNA (32Huang T. Kuersten S. Deshpande A.M. Spieth J. MacMorris M. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To examine whether the potential downstream gene fre-1 is, in fact, synthesized as part of an operon, we performed RT-PCR with an SL2 primer and fre-1-specific primer 2 (21Zorio D.A. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and demonstrated amplification of fre-1 (Fig. 2). Moving upstream to dcs-1, we showed that dcs-1 cDNA can be amplified with a primer to the SL1 trans-spliced leader but not the SL2 leader, demonstrating that dcs-1 is the 5′-cistron within the dcs-1:fre-1 operon. Because the next downstream and upstream genes are more than 10 kbp away from dcs-1 and fre-1, exceeding the maximally observed intercistronic distance by more than 20-fold (31Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nature Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 110-118Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we conclude that dcs-1 and fre-1 constitute a two-gene operon in C. elegans. A recent high-throughput study of SL2-transpliced transcripts predicted that Y113G7A.9 (dcs-1) and Y113G7A.8 (fre-1) are in a two-gene operon (31Blumenthal T. Gleason K.S. Nature Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 110-118Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It should be noted that because the mRNAs for both dcs-1 and fre-1 are trans-spliced to SL sequences, these transcripts are expected to contain the trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap from the nuclear SL RNA molecules, like those of other small nuclear RNAs (33Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DCS-1 Is a Member of the Hint Branch of the HIT Hydrolase Superfamily with Specificity for 7meGMP in the Primary Nucleotide Binding Site—Human scavenger decapping enzyme was recently reported to hydrolyze 7meGpppG to 7meGMP plus GDP (18Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Sequences of Dcps and Dcs orthologs (hereafter, these enzymes are termed Dcs to distinguish them from unrelated Dcp mRNA decapping enzymes (34Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar)) were described as containing a His-[phis]-His-[phis]-His-[phis]-[phis] motif in which the second His is required for activity but with no other similarity to HIT hydrolases (18Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The orthologous enzyme from fission yeast, named Nhm1p, was described as having low level similarity to Fhit, but only similarity with the orthologous enzymes was shown (19Salehi Z. Geffers L. Vilela C. Birkenhager R. Ptushkina M. Berthelot K. Ferro M. Gaskell S. Hagan I. Stapley B. McCarthy J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on our crystal structures of nucleotide-bound forms of Hint (35Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and Fhit (15Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we performed a structure-based alignment of three Hint orthologs, three Aprataxin orthologs, three Fhit orthologs, and three Dcs orthologs. As shown in Fig. 3, although the level of sequence identity between Dcs sequences and the three other enzymes is low, there is significant conservation that begins one residue before the first α-helix of the Hint structure through one residue after the fifth and final β-strand that is conserved in all HIT hydrolases (this strand is numbered 7 in Fhit because two short helices replace the first helix in Hint (15Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structure. 1997; 5: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). There is no similarity outside this core structure, suggesting that Dcs homologs are unique outside of the dimeric 10-stranded GalT half-barrel that has been found in all HIT enzymes (10Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although human Dcs has a Thr in the seventh position of the His-[phis]-His-[phis]-His-[phis]-[phis] motif, the alignment shows that this β-branched and moderately hydrophobic residue does not violate the rule because Dcs homologs have β-branched hydrophobic residues Ile and Val, which along with Leu, are the consensus. More surprising than Thr in the seventh position of the HIT motif is the lack of a His that aligns with Hint residue 51 and Fhit residue 35. This residue is in a hydrogen-bonding network interacting with the final His of the HIT motif that has been proposed to be involved in leaving group leaving and water attack (10Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Dcs orthologs have a polar residue at this position. Beyond conserved N- and C-terminal extensions that are diagnostic for DCS sequences, the DCS enzymes have a short, acidic loop insertion between β-strands 1 and 2 and a distinctive loop between β-strands 2 and 3 containing the sequence L-P-D-[phis]-K-W-D-G. On the basis of the crystal structure of Hint bound to GMP (35Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), this loop is positioned to make contact with 7me group of 7meG, which we predict accounts for the 7meGMP-specificity of DCS-1 and its homologs. Specificity of DCS-1 Defined with 7meGpppBODIPY—We expressed His-tagged worm DCS-1 in E. coli and purified it to homogeneity. To characterize the specificity of this enzyme, we synthesized a novel fluorescent analog, 7meGpppBODIPY. Because the specificity of human Dcps was reported to be for analogs of capped RNAs such as 7meGpppG, 7meGpppA, or 7meGppp(Np)n, where n <10 (18Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the lack of specificity for substrate features beyond 7meGTP would allow us to substitute a BODIPY reporter group for a nucleoside, nucleotide, or short oligonucleotide. In the past, GpppBODIPY was synthesized from GTPγS by conjugation of an iodoacetamide-linked BODIPY probe (29Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we used nucleoside diphosphate kinase to transfer the γ phosphorothio group of ATPγS to 7meGDP. The resulting 7meGTPγS was then converted to 7meGpppBODIPY by established methods (29Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, this turned out to be a nearly essential modification for DCS-1 characterization. Whereas Fhit substrates ApppBODIPY and GpppBODIPY were cleaved by DCS-1 with k cat values of less than 0.01 s-1 and 0.035 s-1, the 7me modification of GpppBODIPY increased k cat to >0.17 s-1. Taking k cat/K m as the specificity constant, DCS-1 prefers 7meGpppBODIPY to ApppBODIPY and GpppBODIPY by >35- and 75-fold, respectively. In the context of the BODIPY nucleotide substrates, the 7me modification to G accounts for a 7-fold discrimination in K m and a 5-fold discrimination in the k cat term. The 1.21-μm K m measured for DCS-1 hydrolysis of 7meGpppBODIPY compares favorably with good substrates for other histidine triad enzymes: Fhit cleaves GpppBODIPY with a 1.4 μm K m, though the higher k cat gives an overall higher specificity constant (29Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated that 7meGpppBODIPY is a useful probe for DCS-1, we sought to further dissect substrate r"

The initiating structural events leading to this protein misfolding are unknown. Through the use of compensatory mutations, in conjunction with crystal structure-based molecular analysis, we established that the larger and positively charged Arg replacing Leu125 sterically hinders both the adjacent Trp126 and a critical interhelical interaction between transmembrane III (TM III) and transmembrane V (TM V; Glu122 and His211 salt bridge). Further, analysis of another retinitis pigmentosa mutation, A164V (TM IV), indicates that the larger Val interferes with residues Leu119 and Ile123 on TM III, leading to the disruption of the same critical Glu122-His211 salt bridge (TM III-TM V interaction). Combined, these localized defects in interhelical interactions cause structural changes that interfere with the ability of opsin to bind 11-cis-retinal. These distortions ultimately lead to the formation of an abnormal disulfide bond, severe protein instability, aggregation, and endoplasmic reticulum retention. In the absence of a crystal or NMR structure of each retinitis pigmentosa mutation, compensatory mutagenesis and crystal structure-based analysis are powerful tools in determining the localized molecular disturbances. A detailed understanding of the initiating local perturbations created by missense mutations such as these, not only identifies critical factors required for correct folding and stability, but additionally opens avenues for rational drug design, mimicking the compensatory mutations and stabilizing the protein.

Rhodopsin, the dim light-activated photoreceptor in the retina, is considered to be a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (1Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A substantial understanding of the structure of rhodopsin has been obtained from electron cryomicroscopy (2Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A.

More recently, the 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of rhodopsin (the first solved among the G protein-coupled receptors) has provided a detailed three-dimensional model of the structure of rhodopsin (6Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Through the induction of structural defects, naturally occurring rhodopsin mutations result in the onset of a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal degenerative disorders collectively called retinitis pigmentosa (RP) 1The abbreviations used are: RP, retinitis pigmentosa; TM, transmembrane; DM, N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UV-Vis, UV-visible. (reviewed in Ref. 8Stojanovic A. Hwa J. Recept. Channels. 2002; 8: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus far, more than 90 different rhodopsin point mutations have been identified, affecting ∼1 in 3500, or an estimated 2 million people worldwide (8Stojanovic A. Hwa J. Recept. Channels. 2002; 8: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although there are no current, effective therapies for retinitis pigmentosa, supplementation with vitamin A (the precursor of 11-cis-retinal) has been helpful in treating a subset of RP patients (9Berson E.L. Rosner B. Sandberg M.A. Hayes K.C. Nicholson B.W. Weigel-DiFrano C. Willett W. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1993; 111: 1456-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More detailed analyses have examined the direct effect of vitamin A, as well as other retinoids, on the protein folding and stability properties of specific retinitis pigmentosa mutants. A treatment protocol of Vitamin A plus 11-cis-retinal improved stability of the T17M mutant protein and delayed photoreceptor degradation in a transgenic mouse model expressing that retinitis pigmentosa mutant (10Li T. Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Rosner B. Hayes K.C. Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that improved folding of P23H, the most common retinitis pigmentosa mutant in North America, can be achieved with both 11-cis-7-ring-retinal (11Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V.

Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918PubMed Google Scholar) addition. As a representative G protein-coupled receptor, rhodopsin is an integral membrane protein composed of three distinct regions: the intracellular (cytoplasmic), transmembrane, and extracellular (intradiscal) regions (Fig. 1). The intradiscal loop connecting helices IV and V contains Cys187 and forms a plug upon which 11-cis-retinal lies (7Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Cys187 also forms a highly conserved disulfide bond with Cys110, which is essential for the correct folding, stability, and function of rhodopsin (13Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 14Hwa J. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Hwa J. Reeves P.J. Klein-Seetharaman J. Davidson F. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1932-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The intradiscal domain is structurally coupled to the transmembrane (TM) domain. Thus, mutations in the intradiscal domain can severely affect the ability of rhodopsin to bind 11-cis-retinal in the TM domain. Similarly, mutations within the TM domain can lead to the formation of an abnormal Cys185-Cys187 disulfide bond, resulting in irreversible protein misfolding. Within the transmembrane domain, 11-cis-retinal covalently binds to opsin via a protonated Schiff base at the ϵ-amino group of Lys296 located in TM VII (16Bownds D. Nature. 1967; 216: 1178-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 17Wang J.K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5111-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This interaction is stabilized by a negatively charged counterion at Glu113 within TM III (18Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 19Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9746-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transmembrane domain is also essential in conveying a conformational change induced by cis-trans isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to the cytoplasmic domain. Most RP mutations lead to varying degrees of rhodopsin misfolding, particularly those found in the intradiscal and transmembrane domains (20Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The degree of misfolding can be gauged by the inability of opsin to bind 11-cis-retinal. L125R (TM III) is one of the most serious RP mutants, as measured by the total inability of the expressed mutant opsin to bind 11-cis-retinal (complete misfolding), retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, poor expression, and lack of glycosylation. This complete loss of retinal binding and correct opsin folding is depicted by the absence of 500 nm absorption in the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum (22Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4560-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly, A164V (TM IV) is an RP mutant that causes severe misfolding, as characterized by deficient 11-cis-retinal binding and a reduced protein stability. These mutations ultimately lead to the formation of an abnormal Cys185-Cys187 disulfide bond (14Hwa J. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) characteristic of misfolded opsin. The molecular basis for the initiation of such protein misfolding among the RP rhodopsin mutations is unknown. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of these RP mutations can also provide a wealth of information on the normal structure and function of rhodopsin, particularly when combined with crystal structure analysis. In this study, we examine the initiating structural events that lead to misfolding for the two severe RP mutations L125R and A164V, in the third and fourth transmembrane helices (TM III and TM IV), respectively (20Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We postulate that there may be common regional mechanisms affecting critical interhelical interactions that lead to misfolding. Using compensatory mutations (based upon crystal structure analysis; Table I), we have determined the specific conformations adopted by the two mutant residues at positions 125 and 164. Both the L125R and A164V mutants interfere with a Glu122-His211 salt bridge, adjacent to the hydrophobic β-ionone ring of 11-cis-retinal. Furthermore, the L125R also disrupts Trp126, a highly conserved residue that plays a critical role in stabilizing the Glu122-His211 salt bridge interaction. Based upon our experimental data and molecular modeling of the rhodopsin crystal structure, we propose the destruction of the Glu122-His211 salt bridge connecting TM III and TM V as the initiating event for the structural defects associated with these two important rhodopsin RP mutants.Table IRetinitis Pigmentosa perturbs interhelical interactionsRP mutant and double mutantsRP mutant and double mutantsL125R (TMIII)A164V (TMIV)L125R (TMIII) + E122L (TMIII)A164V (TMIV) + F115A (TMIII)L125R (TMIII) + E122Q (TMIII)A164V (TMIV) + L119A (TMIII)A164V (TMIV) + E122D (TMIII)L125R (TMIII) + W126D (TMIII)A164V (TMIV) + E133D (TMIII)L125R (TMIII) + W126G (TMIII)A164V (TMIV) + W126A (TMIII)L125R (TMIII) + W126G (TMIII)A164V (TMIV) + W126L (TMIII)L125R (TMIII) + W126V (TMIII)L125R (TMIII) + L128D (TMIII)L125R (TMIII) + H211D (TMV)L125R (TMIII) + H211E (TMV)L125R (TMIII) + F212D (TMV)L125R (TMIII) + F212E (TMV)L125R (TMIII) + P215D (TMV)L125R (TMIII) + L216E (TMV)L125R (TMIII) + F261D (TMVI)L125R (TMIII) + F261E (TMVI) Open table in a new tab Materials—11-cis-retinal was a gift from Rosalie Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina) and NEI, National Institutes of Health. N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Anti-rhodopsin-1D4 mouse monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from Diane Perez (The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) and was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as described (24Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to the Alexa Fluor® 488 dye was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The buffers used were: PBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2), rhodopsin elution buffer (PBS, 0.05% w/v DM, 50 μm nonapeptide corresponding to the C terminus rhodopsin sequence), and solubilization buffer (PBS, 1.0% w/v DM, 0.2 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm ATP). Construction of Rhodopsin Gene Mutants—Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the synthetic rhodopsin gene in the pMT4 expression vector (25Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) through PCR mutagenesis. Complementary sets of oligonucleotide primers (∼30 bases each) were constructed containing the change in codon 125 from (CTG (Leu) → CGG (Arg)) and in codon 164 from (GCT (Ala) → GTT (Val)). The reaction mixture contained 5 μl of 10× Pfu reaction buffer, 500 ng of wild-type construct, 500 ng of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 μl of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The cycling protocol was composed of 16 cycles at 96 °C for 1 min, followed by 50 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 14 min. Upon completion, the restriction enzyme DpnI was added to digest native rhodopsin DNA strands. Ten microliters of the PCR product was used to transform 125 μl of DH5α competent cells (∼2 × 109 cells). After DNA extraction from selected clones, large plasmid preparations were isolated using the Wizard® Maxipreps DNA purification resin (Promega). All DNA sequences were verified by dideoxynucleotide chain-termination sequencing at the Molecular and Cellular Biology Core Facility (Dartmouth Medical School). Compensatory mutations for the L125R and A164V mutants were engineered by PCR mutagenesis as described above, using the L125R or A164V mutant as the template DNA. Isolation and confirmation of mutant DNA was performed as described above. Expression and Purification of Rhodopsin and Rhodopsin Mutants—The procedure for the transient transfection of pMT4 vectors carrying the opsin genes in COS-1 cells has been modified from the previously described protocol (24Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with vector containing wild-type or mutant rhodopsin DNA (20 μg/150-mm plate) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0) and DEAE-Dextran (0.25 mg/ml). Following incubation for 6 h (37 °C), the cells were treated with 0.1 mm chloroquine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h (37 °C). The cells were harvested 40 h after transfection, washed with PBS buffer, and treated with 11-cis-retinal (5-50 μm) for 3 h in the dark (4 °C). All subsequent work was performed in the dark. Solubilization buffer containing 1% DM (final) was added for 1 h (4 °C). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min (4 °C), the supernatant was collected and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on a Rho-1D4-Sepharose column (200 μl with binding capacity of 160 μg of rhodopsin). The column was washed with 50 bed volume of PBS buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) DM, before elution of rhodopsin using 2 bed volume portions of rhodopsin elution buffer containing the 1D4 peptide. UV-Visible (UV-Vis) Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ-40 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. All spectra were obtained at 20 °C, using a bandwidth of 2 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 480 nm/min. Data were analyzed with the accompanying PerkinElmer UV WinLab program. Thermal Stability—Rhodopsin thermal stability was determined by monitoring the decay of the 500 nm absorbance, at a constant temperature of 50 °C, using the UV-Vis absorption spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra were obtained at 5-min intervals until complete disappearance of the 500 nm absorbance. Absorption values at 500 nm (y-axis) were plotted against time (x-axis). Non-linear regression curve fitting to determine half-life (min) was performed using GraphPad Prism® and expressed as mean ± S.E. All means and S.E. were calculated from at least n = 3 separate experiments using separate protein preparations. Data were determined to be statistically significant using the unpaired t test (*, p <0.05; **, p <0.01; ***, p <0.001). Metarhodopsin II Formation—Metarhodopsin II formation was measured as an increase in the 380-nm peak and loss of 500 nm absorption following illumination of rhodopsin protein. Protein samples were illuminated with a 150-watt fiber optic light (Fiber Lite A-200; Dolan-Jenner, Woburn, MA) equipped with a >495-nm-long pass filter (Oriel) for either 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, or 5 min (20 °C). Immediately after each period of illumination, a UV-Vis absorption spectrum was acquired to determine the amount of metarhodopsin II formation. Experiments determining metarhodopsin II formation were repeated at least three times. Metarhodopsin II Decay—The rate of metarhodopsin II decay was measured after illumination of protein samples by following the rate of fluorescence increase (corresponding to retinal release). The protein samples contained 2 μg of protein in 200 μl of 2 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0), containing 0.05% DM. Samples were bleached at 20 °C for 30 s, and the fluorescence increase was measured. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 nm (slit = 0.25 nm) and 330 nm (slit = 12 nm), respectively. Non-linear regression curve fitting was performed for each construct, and metarhodopsin II decay half-life (min) determined. All means and S.E. were calculated from at least n = 3 separate experiments using separate protein preparations. Data were determined to be statistically significant using the unpaired t test (*, p <0.05; **, p <0.01; ***, p <0.001). Western Blot Analysis of Rhodopsin and Rhodopsin Mutants—The presence of rhodopsin protein was determined through Western blot analysis, using a monoclonal antibody targeting the C terminus 1D4 epitope tag. Each eluted sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then immunoblotted using an anti-1D4 mouse monoclonal primary antibody (300 ng/ml) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Immunofluorescent Staining of COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips (No.1 18-mm-square; Corning) in 6-well plates and transfected as described. Cells were permeabilized and fixed in methanol for 5 min (-20 °C) and in acetone for 5 min (-20 °C) and then rehydrated in PBS buffer for 10 min. The fixed cells were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, incubated with an anti-Rho-1D4 mouse monoclonal primary antibody (3 μg/ml) for 1 h, and stained with an Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (2 μg/ml) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS buffer and mounted on glass microscope slides with PBS. Cells were visualized with a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) MRC-1024 krypton/argon laser confocal system with fluorescence excitation at 488 nm and detected with Photomultiplier detectors for three-color confocal imaging (Herbert C. Englert Cell Analysis Laboratory, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH). Computer Modeling—The rhodopsin crystal structure (Protein Data Base accession number 1HZX) (7Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) was visualized with the Swiss PDB Viewer computer program (GlaxoSmithKline, Geneva, Switzerland) (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar). The native amino acid Leu125 was initially examined and residues within 5 angstroms were selected for mutagenesis, with a majority being converted to either Asp or Glu (Table I). Similarly, the native amino acid Ala164 was examined, and a number of residues on TM III, within 5 angstroms, were selected for mutagenesis to smaller residues. Energy minimization was performed with the native amino acids replaced by the mutant residues, using Swiss PDB Viewer. Of all the possible rotamers for each mutant residue (18 for Arg and 9 for Val), the most likely rotamer was selected as the one totaling the lowest score according to the equation: (score = (4 × clash (n) with backbone N-CA and N-C atoms) + (3 × clash (n) with backbone O atoms) + (2 × clash (n) with side-chain atoms) - H-bonds (n) -4 × S-S-bonds (n)). Thus, theoretically, this rotamer will be the one with the lowest number of steric clashes, while also maximizing the amount of hydrogen and disulfide bonding. Putative H-bonds are depicted in green, and steric hindrances in purple. These analyses were then compared with experimental data from the compensatory mutations to determine the validity of the chosen rotamer and to create a theoretical model rationalizing the biochemical defects caused by each RP mutation. Initial analysis of the positions of RP mutations on the crystal structure of rhodopsin revealed distinct localization, such that transmembrane mutations could be divided into two major groups, one positioned around the Schiff base and the other in close proximity to the β-ionone ring of 11-cis-retinal. Beyond the transmembrane domain, a third major group of RP mutations was localized around the conserved disulfide bond and a fourth at the C-terminal tail. These results suggested that all four regions, the β-ionone ring, Schiff base, disulfide bond, and C-terminal tail, are essential for correct folding and cell surface expression. We further hypothesized that, within each region, distinct structural components (e.g. interhelical interactions, salt bridge) are present that, if disrupted, initiate instability and misfolding. Using the severely misfolded L125R (in TM III near the β-ionone ring), our initial intent was to establish the precise molecular defect initiated by the Arg substitution. The L125R Rhodopsin RP Mutant Results in Severe Protein Misfolding—Rhodopsin mutant opsins were constructed, expressed, and purified in parallel with the wild-type receptor. The dark UV-Vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 2A) shows the formation of the characteristic wild-type rhodopsin chromophore with absorbance maxima at 500 and 280 nm, as well as the expected absorbance ratio A280/A500 = 2.0. The 280 nm absorbance is related to tryptophan and aromatic residues in the protein, whereas the 500 nm absorbance reflects 11-cis-retinal binding opsin. The RP mutant L125R shows no 500 nm absorbance and thus lacks chromophore formation (i.e. 11-cis-retinal binding), even with a 10-fold increase in the concentration of 11-cis-retinal (50 μm). SDS-PAGE analysis (1D4 monoclonal antibody) of wild-type rhodopsin (Fig. 2B) showed the characteristic 40-kDa band (Rho +) with a heterogeneous glycosylation smear. In contrast, the L125R mutant (Fig. 2B), when transfected and purified in an identical manner to wild type, exhibited little protein and presented evidence of aggregation. In COS-1 cells expressing wild-type rhodopsin (Fig. 2C, part I), confocal microscopy showed that rhodopsin was transported to the cell membrane as expected. In contrast, cells expressing the L125R mutant (Fig. 2C, part II) retained opsin within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with no significant surface transport. W126E, W126D, and E122L Rescue L125R Protein Misfolding—Fifteen double mutants (Table I) were constructed in an attempt to stabilize the mutant in the hydrophobic transmembrane environment. Such stabilization would assist in determining the conformation of the mutant Arg residue (18 different conformers were possible). None of the attempted L125R double mutants exhibited detectable 500 nm absorption (spectra not shown). However, upon SDS-PAGE analysis, only double mutants at the Trp126 position (L125R/W126D, L125R/W126E, L125R/W126G, and L125R/W126V) and at the Glu122 position (L125R/E122L) exhibited any significant improvement in protein stability and expression, compared with the L125R mutant (Fig. 2B). Additionally, complete rescue of expression and full glycosylation were apparent with the L125R/W126E and L125R/E122L double mutants. The smear observed with the rescuing double mutants was confirmed to be because of heterogeneous glycosylation through the expression of rhodopsin in the presence of tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor (not shown), suggesting correct intracellular trafficking. The other 10 double mutants were identical to L125R, displaying no glycosylated rhodopsin and an aggregation of misfolded rhodopsin (not shown). Transport to the cell membrane was further confirmed through confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C), which depicted the L125R/W126E (III), and L125R/E122L (IV) rhodopsin proteins properly transported to the cell membrane. Although SDS-PAGE suggested that the L125R/W126V double mutant did improve protein expression (Fig. 2B), confocal microscopy showed a failure to reach the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C, IV). L125R Disturbs a Critical Glu122-His211 (TM III to TM V) Salt Bridge—Upon confirming that only changes to Trp126 and Glu122 (of eight residues in close proximity) resulted in an improvement of the L125R mutant, we commenced crystal structure-based analysis (Swiss PDB) to identify the molecular basis for the compensation. There are 18 possible conformations for the Arg residue at position 125. The Swiss PDB Viewer was utilized to perform calculations (see “Experimental Procedures”) to determine the stability of each conformer. Supporting our experimental data, the most favorable conformation positioned the Arg toward both Trp126 and Glu122 (Fig. 5B). This conformation (number 18/18) had a formula score of -6, the lowest among the 18 conformations, which scored in a range from -6 to +66, with +12 being the median score. Further crystal structure analysis revealed that Trp126 functioned in stabilizing the putative Glu122-His211 salt bridge, between TM III and TM V, respectively (Fig. 5A). Modeling of the L125R mutant (Fig. 5B) confirmed that Arg125 induces a steric clash with both Glu122 and Trp126 (purple lines). Modeling of the energy-minimized L125R/W126D (model not shown) and L125R/W126E (Fig. 5C) double mutants showed that the negatively charged residue at position 126 could partially stabilize Arg125 by hydrogen bonding. Another model, of L125R/E122L (Fig. 5D), showed that stable hydrogen bonding between Arg125 and His211 may restore the critical interaction between TM III and TM V. Additionally, the now hydrophobic Leu122 would be more stable within the hydrophobic binding pocket, with no steric hindrance to Arg125. Mutations at Ala164 Decrease 11-cis-Retinal Binding, Thermal Stability, Metarhodopsin II Formation, and Metarhodopsin II Stability—Having analyzed the L125R mutation in detail, we wanted to examine another mutation in this region (A164V) to determine whether more than one mutation may be affecting this important Glu122-His211 salt bridge. Wild-type and A164V rhodopsins were expressed and purified in parallel. In contrast to L125R, which exhibited no retinal binding, the RP mutant A164V exhibited a reduced 500 nm absorbance and a lower affinity for 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 3A) (20Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type rhodopsin has an absorbance ratio A280/A500 = 2.0, the A164V mutant showed a ratio of 4.5. The effects of additional mutations at position 164 were even more dramatic. The A164I and A164L mutants exhibited absorbance ratios A280/A500 of 12.1 and 12.3, respectively (Fig. 3A). Additionally, absorption maxima had markedly shifted from wild ty"

It is oxidatively labile and requires for its sustained activity an auxiliary repair system that catalyzes a reductive methylation reaction. Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the soluble dual flavoprotein oxidoreductase, methionine synthase reductase, serves as a redox partner for methionine synthase in an NADPH-dependent reaction. However, three reports suggest the possibility of redundancy in this redox pathway. First, a hyperhomocysteinemic patient has been reported who has an isolated functional deficiency of methionine synthase but appears to be distinct from the cblE and cblG classes of patients with defects in methionine synthase reductase and methionine synthase, respectively. Second, another dual flavoprotein oxidoreductase with significant homology to methionine synthase reductase, NR1, has been described recently, but its function is unknown. Third, methionine synthase can be activated in vitro by a two-component redox system comprised of soluble cytochrome b5 and P450 reductase. In this study, we demonstrate a function for human NR1 in vitro. It is able to fully activate methionine synthase in the presence of soluble cytochrome b 5 with a V max of 2.8 ± 0.1 μmol min–1 mg–1 protein, which is comparable with that seen with methionine synthase reductase. The K actNR1 is 1.27 ± 0.16 μm, and a 20-fold higher stoichiometry of reductase to methionine synthase is required for NR1 versus methionine synthase reductase, suggesting that it may represent a minor pathway in the cell, assuming that the two proteins are present at similar levels.

Methionine synthase is the only homocysteine-utilizing enzyme that is found ubiquitously in mammalian tissues. It catalyzes a transmethylation reaction in which a transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) 1The abbreviations used are: CH3-H4folate, 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate; H4folate, tetrahydrofolate; NR1, novel reductase 1; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: CH3-H4folate, 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate; H4folate, tetrahydrofolate; NR1, novel reductase 1; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. to homocysteine results in the formation of H4folate and methionine (1Matthews R.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Banerjee R. Ragsdale S.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 209-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In mammals, this reaction serves to conserve the essential amino acid, methionine, and to deliver the circulating form of the folate cofactor, CH3-H4folate, to H4folate, which can then support reactions in the purine biosynthetic pathway. Elevated levels of homocysteine are a risk factor for atherosclerosis (3Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Medicine. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar), and genetic deficiency of methionine synthase leads to hyperhomocysteinemia (4Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Inherited Disorders of Folate Transport and Metabolism: The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1995Google Scholar).The reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase is dependent on the cofactor, B12 or cobalamin, which alternately accepts and donates the migrating methyl group from CH3-H4folate and to homocysteine, respectively (Fig. 1). The cofactor in turn alternates between the methylcobalamin and cob(I)alamin states. Cob(I)alamin is highly reactive and, indeed, is referred to as a supernucleophile, which befits its role in the chemically challenging displacement of a methyl group from the tertiary amine of CH3-H4folate. However, the reactivity of cob(I)alamin is also its undoing and makes the enzyme vulnerable to oxidative inactivation, leading to generation of cob(II)alamin at a rate that is dependent on the degree of anaerobiosis. Because of the essential nature of the methionine synthase-catalyzed reaction (5Swanson D.A. Liu M.L. Baker P.J. Garrett L. Stitzel M. Wu J. Harris M. Banerjee R. Shane B. Brody L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a reductive activation system coexists in cells and transfers electrons from NADPH via a flavoprotein conduit to methionine synthase in a coupled reduction-methylation reaction in which AdoMet rather than CH3-H4folate serves as a methyl donor (Fig. 1).In Escherichia coli, the flavoprotein conduit is well characterized and is composed of two components, flavodoxin-NADPH oxidoreductase and flavodoxin (6Fujii K. Galivan J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, the components of the mammalian activation system were unknown. Then, five years ago, two groups using different approaches to identify the redox partner reported two different solutions (Fig. 2). Thus, Gravel and coworkers (8Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) using a genetic approach reported the cloning of a soluble human dual flavoprotein oxidoreductase, methionine synthase reductase, and identified mutations in the coding sequence in cblE patient cell lines with known defects in the activation system. In our laboratory, a biochemical fractionation-reconstitution approach pointed to the existence of a two-component system involving soluble cytochrome b5 (9Chen Z. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26248-26255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase was not identified in this study, microsomal P450 reductase was shown to be efficacious in the activation of methionine synthase but only in the presence of soluble cytochrome b5. Because methionine synthase is a soluble enzyme, the physiological relevance of the microsomal cytochrome P450 reductase-soluble cytochrome b5 system has remained an open one. To add to the complexity, a second soluble human dual flavoprotein oxidoreductase, NR1, was described with significant homology to methionine synthase reductase, although its function was unknown (10Paine M.J.

Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35558-35563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Combined with compelling evidence for the existence of about a dozen private mutations in the methionine synthase reductase gene in cblE patients (8Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H.Q. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3059-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 12Wilson A. Leclerc D. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2009-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the biochemical evidence should have laid to rest questions about redundancy in the reductive activation system for mammalian methionine synthase. However, a third genetic complementation group has recently been described in a patient displaying an isolated functional deficiency in methionine synthase, i.e. the second B12 enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA synthase, is not impaired (13Fowler B. Suormala T. Gunther M. Till J. Wraith J.E. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1997; 20: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two of the previously identified genetic complementation groups, cblE and cblG, represent defects in methionine synthase reductase and methionine synthase, respectively. The existence of a third genetic locus leading to methionine synthase deficiency reopens the question of whether an alternate activation route for methionine synthase might exist in cells.In this study, we have examined the ability of human NR1, a soluble dual flavoprotein of unknown function, to activate mammalian methionine synthase. To do so, we developed a simpler expression system for the human enzyme in E. coli rather than in insect cells as described previously (10Paine M.J. Garner A.P. Powell D. Sibbald J. Sales M. Pratt N. Smith T. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1471-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that human NR1 in the presence, but not absence, of soluble cytochrome b5 can activate methionine synthase. The stoichiometry for full activation by NR1 is significantly greater than required for methionine synthase reductase, suggesting that it represents a substantially less efficient route physiologically, assuming that the levels of the two soluble flavoproteins are approximately equal in cells. Interestingly, this study suggests an explanation for the two-component, soluble cytochrome b5 -dependent reductive activation system that had been described previously using a functional reconstitution approach in our laboratory (9Chen Z. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26248-26255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Glutathione-Sepharose 4B, Sephacryl S200, and (6-R, S)-5-[14CH3]H4folate (barium salt, 55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were from Sigma, and restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen unless stated otherwise. (6-R, S)-CH3-H4folate (calcium salt) was obtained from Schircks's Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Porcine livers were obtained fresh from a slaughterhouse in Crete, NE, cubed, and stored frozen at –80 °C until further use.Cloning the cDNA Encoding Human NR1—The cDNA encoding NR1 was cloned by PCR, using the following nondegenerate oligonucleotides based on the published sequence (10Paine M.J. Garner A.P. Powell D. Sibbald J. Sales M. Pratt N. Smith T. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1471-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar): forward, 5′-GCGAATTCATGCCGAGCCCGCAGCTTCTG-3′, and reverse, (5′-CGCTCGAGTCAGGCCCACGTCTCTGTCTG-3′). The sequences in bold letters correspond to EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites that were designed into the primer sequences. The gene was generated using I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone 4869561 obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) as a template. Following amplification of this cDNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), the gene was ligated into the TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm that no PCR-induced errors had been introduced. The conditions for PCR amplification were as follows: denaturation at 98 °C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of the sequence 98 °C, 1 min, 65 °C, 1 min, 72 °C, 4 min, followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the 1.8-kb insert containing the open reading frame for NR1 was excised using the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and subcloned in-frame with the GST-coding sequence in the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting plasmid, pHONR1, was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for expression studies.Expression of Recombinant NR1—An overnight culture of E. coli containing the expression construct was grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). One liter of modified Terrific broth (20 g of yeast extract, 10 g of bactotryptone, 4 ml of glycerol, 4.33 g of Na2HPO4, and 2.65 g of KH2PO4), with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture and grown at 37 °C. When the culture reached an A600 nm of ∼1.0, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and the temperature was switched to 25 °C. The cells were grown further overnight, pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min and stored at –80 °C until further use.The frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in GST wash/bind buffer (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing Complete™ protease inhibitor tablets. Cell lysis was achieved by lysozyme addition (200 μg/ml) and sonication (7 × 20-s bursts with 3-min pause intervals at a power setting of 7), using a Misonix Sonicator XL2020 (Misonix Inc.). The sonicate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 60 min to pellet cell debris and insoluble matter. The resulting supernatant was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, previously equilibrated with GST wash/bind buffer. Nonspecifically bound proteins were washed from the column with 1 liter of GST wash/bind buffer, and the GST-fused NR1 protein was eluted with a 10-mm glutathione solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The GST tag was removed by limited proteolysis with thrombin. The buffer was exchanged to 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, by overnight dialysis of NR1 at 4 °C. The enzyme was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a 150 × 25 mm POROS HQ-10 column (PerSeptive Biosystems) using a linear gradient ranging from 50 to 300 mm NaCl in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and a flow rate of 10 ml/min. NR1-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by affinity chromatography on a 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column as described (10Paine M.J. Garner A.P. Powell D. Sibbald J. Sales M.

The concentration of purified recombinant NR1 was determined spectroscopically, using a molar extinction coefficient of 21,600 m–1 cm–1 at 450 nm. ∼0.8 mg of NR1 was obtained per liter of culture.Peptide Sequencing—The NR1 protein band was excised from a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and submitted to the Protein Core Facility (University of Nebraska, Lincoln) for N-terminal sequencing.Flavin Determination and Spectral Analysis—The flavin cofactor content was determined as previously described (11Olteanu H.

The assay mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 100 mm potassium chloride, 500 μm homocysteine, 19 μm AdoMet, 250 μm (6-R, S)-5- [14C]CH3-H4folate (∼2000 dpm/nmol), 5 μm soluble cytochrome b5 , 1 mm NADPH, and the indicated amounts of methionine synthase and NR1 in a total volume of 1 ml. Reagents were made anaerobic by purging with nitrogen and added to stoppered assay vials with gas-tight syringes. The mixture lacking CH3-H4folate was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated with CH3-H4folate, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and terminated by heating at 98 °C for 2 min. The assay mixture was immediately placed on ice for 2 min and then passed through a small (0.5 × 6 cm) column of Dowex 1X8–200 (chloride form). The column was washed with 2 ml of water, and the eluate was collected in a scintillation vial. Scintillation fluid (10 ml) was added to the aqueous sample, and the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. All reported values are corrected for the counts observed in control assays run in parallel from which NR1 was omitted.Ionic strengths were calculated as described by Perrin and Dempsey (17Perrin D.D.

The ionic strength, I, of a solution is given by Equation 1, where ci is the concentration of each type of ion (in mols/liter) and z is its charge. I=1/2Σ(ciz2)(Eq. 1) The ionic strength dependence of the methionine synthase activation assay was determined in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, to which KCl was added to give ionic strengths ranging from 120 to 820 mm.Cytochrome c Reduction Assay—Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored by measuring the absorbance change at 550 nm as described in Ref. 10Paine M.J.

To facilitate studies with the full-length NR1 protein, we expressed NR1 heterologously in E. coli as a fusion protein with GST. A three-step purification involving two affinity columns, GST-Sepharose and 2′5′ ADP-agarose, and a limited proteolysis step to remove the GST tag were employed (Fig. 3). Recombinant human NR1 was obtained in >95% purity and migrated with a molecular mass of 68 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 67 kDa (10Paine M.J. Garner A.P. Powell D. Sibbald J.

The absorbance ratio of the 270 nm (protein) to 450 nm (flavin) peaks was 5.06, consistent with the presence of highly pure protein. Addition of NADPH under aerobic conditions resulted in a decrease in the absorption of the oxidized flavin peaks at 380 and 460 nm and the appearance of long wavelength absorption with a peak at 585 nm and shoulder at 626 nm, consistent with the formation of an airstable blue semiquinone (Fig. 4, inset). HPLC analysis of the flavins bound to NR1 revealed the presence of stoichiometric FMN and FAD in a 1:1 molar ratio. In these respects, the properties of the human NR1 expressed in E. coli are indistinguishable from those reported previously for the protein isolated from an insect cell culture (10Paine M.J.

Thus, by all these measures, human NR1 purified from E. coli and insect cells are indistinguishable.Activation of Mammalian Methionine Synthase by NR1— Recombinant human NR1, unlike methionine synthase reductase, was unable to reactivate porcine methionine synthase in the presence of NADPH and AdoMet (Table I). Surprisingly, addition of soluble cytochrome b5 led to full methionine synthase activity at levels supported by methionine synthase reductase alone and greater than the in vitro activation system, which is seminanaerobic.Table IReductive activation of methionine synthase activation by NR1Assay conditionsaThe anaerobic NADPH assay described under “Experimental Procedures” was employed for the first four entries, and the assay mixtures contained the same amount of porcine methionine synthase.

Reactivation of methionine synthase by NR1-soluble cytochrome b5 is maximal between 120–220 mm and declines steeply at higher ionic strengths (Fig. 5). In contrast, reactivation by methionine synthase reductase shows more of a bell-shaped dependence and is maximal at an ionic strength of 220 mm.Fig. 5Comparison of the ionic strength dependence for activation of methionine synthase by NR1-soluble cyotchrome b5 (–•–) and by methionine synthase reductase (–○–).

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONMethionine synthase is an essential gene in mammals and serves as a gateway enzyme that makes the circulating form of folic acid, CH3-H4folate, available intracellularly to support critical biochemical transformations, including steps involved in purine biosynthesis. Simultaneously, it plays a key role in removal of homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid that is generated by hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine and one that is toxic when present at elevated levels (3Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygard O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Medicine. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). Dysfunction of methionine synthase has pleiotropic clinical consequences, including hyperhomocysteinemia with attendant severe cardiovascular problems, hypomethioninemia, megaloblastic anemia, and developmental delay (4Rosenblatt D.S.

The members of this superfamily can be identified by a highly conserved amino acid signature sequence called the Nudix box, viz. in which X represents any amino acid and U is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid, usually Ile, Leu, or Val. A current BLAST (2Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

We have been systematically cloning, expressing, and characterizing members of the superfamily, and without exception, all of the enzymes identified so far hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphate derivatives including nucleotide sugars, dinucleoside polyphosphates, coenzymes, (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, and ADP-ribose. Since the same amino acid signature sequence, the Nudix box, represents the nucleotide binding and catalytic site for all these proteins (3Bullions, L. C.

By aligning amino acid sequences of those enzymes hydrolyzing a similar spectrum of substrates, we have identified certain landmark amino acids outside of the Nudix box, enabling us to classify some of the members of the superfamily into distinct subfamilies (6Dunn C.A.

This has been of singular value, because it has allowed us to predict the enzymatic activity of unidentified open reading frames involved in physiological processes, merely by observing specific telltale amino acid patterns peculiar to each subfamily. In this paper, we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and identification of members of a new subfamily of the Nudix hydrolases, highly active on 5-methyl-UTP (ribo-TTP) and UTP, and recognizable by characteristic amino acid sequences outside of the Nudix box. The expression plasmid pET-24a(+) (Kmr) and Escherichia coli HMS174 (DE3) were from Novagen (Madison WI); Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 was a gift from Judith Bender, The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain BB3/216/ATCC27853, was a gift from Thomas Cebula of the Food and Drug Administration; and Caulobacter crescentus strain CB15 was a gift of Lucy Shapiro, Stanford University, and Bert Ely, the University of South Carolina. The plasmid, pTrc99A (Ampr), and Sephadex G-100 were from Amersham Biosciences, and the restriction enzymes, PCR kits, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The canonical nucleotide substrates and common chemicals were from Sigma or Invitrogen, and 5-methyl-UTP was from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA). The PCR primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Protein assay reagent was from Bio-Rad. Cloning of A. tumefaciens orf147 and Its Orthologs—Standard cloning technology was used. Briefly, orf147 was amplified directly from one colony of A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 using the DNA PCR. NdeI and BamHI restriction sites were incorporated at the start and end of the gene, respectively, and the amplified DNA was purified, digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into pET24a(+) to place the gene under transcriptional control of the T7 lac promoter. The resultant plasmid, pETORF147 was transformed into E. coli DH5a for storage and into HMS174 (DE3) for protein expression. The orthologous genes from P. aeruginosa and C. crescentus were cloned using similar procedures. For complementation studies, the gene was cut out of pETORF147 with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into the corresponding sites of pTrc99A putting orf147 under control of the trc promoter. The resulting plasmid, pTrcORF147, was transformed into DH5α. Growth and Expression of HMS174:pETorf147, ORF147, and Its Orthologs—One colony of the expression strain was inoculated into 40 ml of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin, incubated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker overnight, transferred to 2 liters of the same medium, and grown to an A 600 of 0.8. The culture was derepressed by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 0.5 mm and grown for an additional 3 h, after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in buffered isotonic saline solution. Purification of the Enzymes—The washed cells were frozen at –80 °C overnight and resuspended in 2.5 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). The supernatant (fraction I) containing the expressed protein was collected by centrifugation, and 10% streptomycin sulfate in buffer A was added to a final concentration of 1.5% to precipitate nucleic acids. These were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant (fraction II) was brought to 60% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was collected and dissolved in a minimal volume of buffer A (fraction III), and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column equilibrated and eluted with buffer A plus 200 mm sodium chloride. The fractions were located by A 280 absorbance and identified by their migration on an SDS-PAGE gel. Those containing the purified protein were pooled, assayed, and stored at –80 °C (fraction IV). All of the orthologs of ORF147, including those from A. tumefaciens, P. aeruginosa, and C. crescentus were purified by similar procedures. Enzyme Assays—The standard reaction contained in 50 μl: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 5 mm Mg2+, 2 mm substrate, 0.5 unit of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase for substrates such as (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates and their derivatives, or 4 units of alkaline phosphatase for all other substrates and 0.1–2 milliunits of purified enzyme. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, stopped by the addition of 250 μl of 4 mm EDTA, and the liberated inorganic orthophosphate was assayed by the colorimetric procedure of Fiske and SubbaRow (7Fiske C.H.

Complementation Test for the mutT Mutator Phenotype—Gene orf147 was cloned into pTrc99A and transformed into E. coli strain SB3 lacking a functional mutT gene. The mutation frequencies were calculated from the number of colonies resistant to nalidixic acid or streptomycin as described in O'Handley et al. (9O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.F.

Recognition of the Putative Subfamily—Our customary procedure for identifying the activity of a new open reading frame containing the Nudix box involves BLAST searches (10Altschul S.F. Gish W.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) of the amino acid sequence of the unknown polypeptide. When this was done for an open reading frame from A. tumefaciens, we identified a group of polypeptides with conserved sequences upstream and downstream of the Nudix box (Fig. 1). Since these regions were different from any landmark amino acids described previously (6Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

Accordingly, we investigated this possibility by isolating the expressed proteins and identifying the enzymatic activities of some of the members of the group. Gene Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—Cloning of the genes from single colonies of the individual organisms proceeded pro forma; the inserts were sequenced and were as described in the data banks. All three of the orthologous genes from A. tumefaciens, P. aeruginosa, and C. crescentus expressed proteins in soluble form when introduced into E. coli but with different levels of expression.

This left the bulk of the cellular proteins behind, thereby considerably simplifying the purification. The procedure described under “Methods” led to essentially homogeneous proteins (Fig. 2). Identification of Enzyme Activity and Substrate Specificity— A unifying property of the Nudix hydrolases is their activity on nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, although these substrates may vary widely for different members of the superfamily. Starting with the purified enzyme expressed from the A. tumefaciens gene, we examined a large number of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives as potential substrates, and we found that UTP was hydrolyzed at the highest rate of all those naturally occurring metabolites tested (Table I). However, we noted an apparent inconsistency in our substrate survey when we observed that dTTP was hydrolyzed at a measurable rate, ∼18% of UTP, whereas dUTP was not a significant substrate. This seemed surprising since it appeared to us that UTP resembled dUTP more closely than it did dTTP, and so it called our attention to the methyl group as a potentially important feature involved in substrate recognition. Accordingly, we tested 5-methyl-UTP and found it is hydrolyzed at three times the rate of UTP. This is shown in Table I along with a comparison to the purified orthologous proteins from P. aeruginosa and C. crescentus. The enzymes from P. aeruginosa and A. tumefaciens have similar specificities, but the active site of the C. crescentus enzyme is more accommodating and has approximately equal activities on UTP and the other pyrimidine ribonucleoside triphosphate, CTP.Table IEnzyme SpecificitySubstrateA. tumefaciensP. aeruginosaC. crescentusSpecific activityRelative activitySpecific activityRelative activitySpecific activityRelative activityunits/mg%units/mg%units/mg%5-Methyl-UTP261(100)227(100)82(100)UTP903483376173dTTP16611568CTP1<0.51<0.55969ATP, dATP, GTP, dGTP, dCTP, dUTP, UDP, dTDP, FAD, NADH, Ap5A,aAp5A is adenosine (5′)-pentaphospho-(5′)-adenosine UDP-glucose, ADP-ribose<0.5<0.2<0.5<0.3<0.5<0.7a Ap5A is adenosine (5′)-pentaphospho-(5′)-adenosine Open table in a new tab A comparison of some of the kinetic properties of the three enzymes is shown in Table II. The combined higher k cat and lower Km for 5-methyl-UTP leads to a 10-fold higher catalytic constant, k cat/Km , over that for UTP for the A. tumefaciens and P. aeruginosa enzymes. These inequalities are not nearly as marked for C. crescentus resulting in less than a 2-fold difference in the values of the catalytic constants for the two substrates, supporting the notion that its catalytic site is more accommodating than those of the other two enzymes. In this respect, it is interesting to note that all known eukaryotic UMP kinases, enzymes involved in the phosphorylation of UMP to UDP, are equally active on UMP and CMP (16Yan H. Tsai M.-D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 103-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be similarities in the active sites of these kinases and the C. crescentus enzyme. Work in progress on the x-ray crystal structure of members of the family should be informative in ascertaining the basis of these observations. 1S. B.

An analysis of the products of UTP hydrolysis with purified A. tumefaciens UTPase indicates that this enzyme also catalyzes an attack on the pyrophosphate linkage. Fig. 3A shows that after a 30-min incubation, the UTP peak decreased, a UMP peak appeared, and there was no apparent formation of UDP. This indicates that there was either a direct conversion of UTP to UMP with the release of inorganic pyrophosphate or that UTP was hydrolyzed to UDP as the rate-limiting step, and the UDP was then rapidly converted to UMP. The second pathway is ruled out for two reasons. First, as shown in Fig. 3B, no inorganic orthophosphate is formed during the course of the reaction, as would be required for conversion of UTP to UDP, unless inorganic pyrophosphatase is present. Second, UDP itself is not a substrate of the enzyme as shown in Table I. Therefore, Reaction 1 describes the stoichiometry, UTP+H2O→UMP+PPiReaction1(Eq. 1) Five other Nudix hydrolase nucleoside triphosphatases are known with major activities on dGTP (18Bhatnagar S.K.

Bessman, unpublished results. all forming the respective monophosphates and inorganic pyrophosphate, classifying them in the category EC 3.6.1.19 with the systematic name nucleoside-triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase. Thus, the UTPase described herein is properly designated UTP pyrophosphohydrolase, and it is the first of these enzymes preferring ribo- to deoxyribonucleotides. Since, to our knowledge, this gene and enzyme has not been described before, we propose the acronym and mnemonic, utp as its designator. Other Properties of the Enzyme—The A. tumefaciens UTPase requires Mg2+ for activity. Unlike many of the other Nudix hydrolases, this requirement cannot be met by Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+. In respect to pH, however, the A. tumefaciens UTPase, like most of the other members of the superfamily, prefers alkaline conditions and is optimally active at pH 9. The protein elutes from a pre-calibrated gel filtration column as expected for an 18-kDa protein and thus probably exists as a monomer in solution. Complementation Studies—The original Nudix hydrolase, MutT, is also a nucleoside pyrophosphohydrolase, although it has a markedly different specificity from the UTPase described here (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 18Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we tested a plasmid containing the UTPase gene for its ability to complement a mutT – strain of E. coli. Although the mutT – strain gave rise to 892 ± 170 streptomycin-resistant colonies per 109 cells, the strain transformed with a mutT + gene produced only 10 colonies, the same number as a mutT + strain. However, the mutT – strain when transformed with the UTPase gene produced 1059 ± 590 colonies. Similar results were seen when nalidixic acid was substituted for streptomycin as the selective antibiotic (data not shown). These results disqualify the UTPase as an ortholog of MutT. Two issues regarding this newly discovered subfamily of Nudix hydrolases merit consideration. 1) What is the nexus linking the members of the group, or what is the commonality of the properties they share? 2) What, if any, is the physiologic relevance of their preference for ribo-TTP? In regard to the first question, this small group of 12 open reading frames (Fig. 1) was culled from over 1100 putative Nudix hydrolases identified by BLAST (10Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (69597) Google Scholar) searches of the data banks. Clustal (11Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) alignments revealed the “L(VL)VRK” motif upstream and the “AANE” motif downstream of the Nudix box, and these two amino acid cassettes define the signature sequence of the family and demarcate it as a distinct subfamily of proteins. The conserved “PGGK” tetrad, overlapping the Nudix box, is not diagnostic, since it is seen in many other Nudix hydrolases with dissimilar specificities. A unifying feature of these six diverse bacterial genera is their relationship to plants, either directly as symbionts (Rhizobium galegae), growth-promoting rhizobacteria living in the soil or rhizosphere (Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Corynebacterium efficiens), plant pathogens (A. tumefaciens, Pseudomonas syringae), or indirectly as indicated by comparative genomics. For example, virulence factors in the animal pathogens Brucella melitens and Brucella suis are related to factors involved in endosymbiosis or pathogenesis in plants, and the erythromycin-resistant plasmid containing the Nudix gene in the human pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae is related to the chloramphenicol resistance plasmid in the soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum. The free-swimming aquatic bacterium, C. crescentus, although not found in the same ecosystem as the other members of the subfamily, derives much of its nutrients from plant polysaccharides including cellulose, lignins, xylan, glucan, and pectin and has gene clusters for their catabolism. Finally, Mycobacterium smegmatis, usually associated with humans, was originally isolated from soil. An exegesis of the preference of the enzyme for ribo-TTP is more elusive. We are not aware of any reports of ribo-TTP in the nucleotide pool of any organism, to say nothing of the organisms comprising the subfamily, although we are also not aware of anyone looking for this nucleoside triphosphate. On the other hand, 5-methyluracil is the most common methylated base in tRNA, and therefore ribo-TMP could arise from tRNA turnover. Furthermore, it has been reported that thymidylate synthase, which catalyzes the methylation of dUMP to TMP, can also use UMP as the acceptor with the formation of ribo-TMP (22Lorenson M.Y. Maley G.F. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3332-3344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the corresponding triphosphate would require sequential activities of a nucleotide kinase and nucleoside diphosphokinase. Although not tested directly, studies on the specificity of purified UMP kinase (23Jong A. Yeh Y. Ma J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggest that ribo-TMP could be phosphorylated to ribo-TDP, and the next step, the phosphorylation to ribo-TTP, would almost certainly proceed smoothly because of the exceedingly broad specificity of nucleoside diphosphokinase. Once formed, ribo-TTP could be readily incorporated into RNA since it has been demonstrated that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases can substitute ribo-TTP for UTP during RNA synthesis (24Slapikoff S. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1967; 12: 3654-3658Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Nakayama C. Saneyoshi M. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1980; 8: 193-196Google Scholar). What effect methyluracils would have on the physiological functions of messenger and/or ribosomal RNA is conjectural. It has been shown that E. coli mutants completely lacking 5-methyluracil in their tRNA show no differences in growth rate, codon recognition, protein synthesis, and macromolecular composition. However, there is a distinct advantage of wild-type cells over those lacking 5-methyluracil in mixed population studies (26Bjork G.R. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 99-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting parallel exists between the ribo-TTPase described here and Orf135, another Nudix hydrolase from E. coli (15O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5421-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The latter enzyme also prefers the non-canonical methylated nucleotide, 5-methyl-dCTP instead of the natural substrate, dCTP. As pointed out earlier (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), the Nudix hydrolases may be thought of as surveillance enzymes, hydrolyzing potentially toxic or deleterious compounds arising during metabolism or preventing the accumulation of anabolic intermediates during the vicissitudes of the cell cycle. The enzymes of this newly discovered subfamily conform to this pattern. If ribo-TTP is an undesirable metabolite indigenous to these related organisms, then they have a means to deal with it. On the other hand, the role of the enzymes may be to monitor the excessive accumulation of the natural nucleoside triphosphate, UTP, and thus could be related functionally to the dGTPase (21Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dATPase (19O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.C. Mildvan A.S. Bessman M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2032273422,"To understand the coordination of gene expression in the Salmonella typhimurium ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster, we had previously identified a 72-bp AT-rich (78% A+T) DNA sequence element, AT4, which was capable of silencing transcription in a promoter nonspecific manner.

After deletion of the AT7 DNA sequence responsible for LeuO binding from AT4, the remaining 47-bp AT-rich (85% A+T) DNA sequence, termed AT8, retains the full bi-directional gene-silencing activity, which is no longer relieved by LeuO. LeuO-mediated transcriptional derepression is restored when the LeuO binding site, AT7, is placed within close proximity to the gene silencer AT8. As a pair of functionally coupled transcription elements, the presence of an equal copy number of AT7 and AT8 within proximity is important for the transcription control. The characterization provides clues for future elucidation of the molecular details whereby LeuO negates the gene-silencing activity.

The characterization provides clues for future elucidation of the molecular details whereby LeuO negates the gene-silencing activity. The suppression of the leu-500 mutation in Salmonella typhimurium topA - strains (1Trucksis M. Golub E.I. Zabel D.J. Depew R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been a paradigmatic phenomenon for explaining the importance of the effect of DNA supercoiling on transcriptional initiation (2Margolin P. Zumstein L. Sternglanz R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5437-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our investigation of the mechanism that underlies this topA - genetic background-dependent phenomenon, we found an unprecedented long range (1.9 kbp) interaction between ilvIH and leu-500 promoters (3Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since then, we have found a promoter relay mechanism (4Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) responsible for the sequential activation of genes in the 1.9-kbp ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD region (illustrated below in Fig. 1). Recent studies demonstrated that this novel promoter relay mechanism is likely to be one of the bacterial stress responses in normal cell physiology rather than just a special phenomenon in S. typhimurium topA - mutants (5Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29929-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.J. Wu H.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The promoter relay mechanism not only provides the explanation for the long range interaction between ilvIH and leu-500 promoters (3Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it also reveals the interesting possibility that transcription-driven DNA supercoiling (10Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 11Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) may play roles in the transcriptional regulation processes that control the expression of the three functionally related genes in a sequential manner (illustrated in Fig. 1 below). A similar effect of transcription-driven DNA supercoiling on gene expression regulation has also been found in the ilvYC operon of Escherichia coli (12Rhee K.Y. Opel M. Ito E. Hung S. Arfin S.M. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Opel M.L. Arfin S.M. Hatfield G.W. Mol.

Transcription-driven DNA supercoiling is indispensable in these processes, but the supercoiling itself alone is insufficient for triggering the gene expression coordination, because deleting part of the DNA sequence from the 1.9-kbp intervening region also abolished the promoter relay mechanism (3Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggested that certain elements in this region must be crucial for relaying the DNA supercoiling effect over a long (1.9 kbp) distance, but their identifications and how they relay the effect of transcription-driven DNA supercoiling remain to be addressed. As part of our efforts to elucidate the molecular details of the sequential gene expression in the ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster, we have identified a 72-bp AT-rich AT4 DNA sequence element located at the leuO promoter end of the 318-bp AT-rich DNA sequence that is flanked by the divergently arrayed leuO and leuABCD (illustrated in Fig. 1 below). The 72-bp AT4 DNA functions as a bacterial gene silencer (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and presumably is responsible for the normal quiescent state of the leuO gene (4Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fang M. Majumder A. Tsai K.J. Wu H.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Majumder A. Fang M. Tsai K.J. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Wu H.Y. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 6602-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The data showed that AT4-mediated gene-silencing activity was bi-directional and promoter-nonspecific and that the AT4 gene silencer functions best if the gene silencer element is flanked by a pair of divergently arrayed transcription activities that simultaneously transcribe away from the silencer (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The gene-silencing activity is significantly reduced when the silencer is located between a pair of parallel transcription units (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 1C.-C. Chen and H.-Y. Wu, unpublished data. These findings are consistent with the natural location of the gene silencer in the chromosome where the gene silencer is located between the divergently arrayed leuO and leuABCD (illustrated in Fig. 1). We proposed transcription-driven DNA supercoiling to be the explanation for the effects of the neighbor transcription activities on AT4-mediated gene silencing (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a transcription element, the functional responsiveness of AT4 DNA to the adjacent transcription activity (transcription-driven DNA supercoiling) is novel. Such responsiveness may be crucial for the DNA element to relay the effect of transcription-driven DNA supercoiling for the sequential gene expression control in the ilvIH-leuO-leuABCD gene cluster. The requirement for the trans-acting LeuO in the final activation of the leu-500 promoter in the promoter relay (4Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29929-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was shown to be due to LeuO-mediated relief (derepression) of AT4 DNA-dependent gene silencing (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We rationalized that LeuO-mediated transcriptional derepression activates the normally silent leuO gene and that the leuO transcription activity-generated DNA supercoiling subsequently activates the DNA supercoiling-sensitive leu-500 promoter via a short-range promoter-promoter interaction (Refs. 15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 18Tan J. Shu L. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and illustrated in Fig. 1). These data further suggested the mechanistic complexity exerted by the relatively simple (72 bp) AT4 DNA. To better understand the mechanistic details whereby AT4 DNA exerts its transcription regulatory activity, we dissected the 72-bp AT4 DNA for elements responsible for the transcriptional repression and derepression, respectively. Plasmids and Bacterial Strains—The pAO plasmid series used in this study was derived from pAO, which has been described previously (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Wu H.Y. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Various parts of the AT4 DNA (the entire AT4 DNA sequence is illustrated below in Figs. 2 and 6) were synthesized and annealed as duplex DNAs for insertion at the unique AatII site of pAO (see plasmid map in Fig. 7 below). For cloning purposes, all DNA inserts contain the 4-bp 3′-protruding DNA sequence complementary to the 4-bp DNA overhang sequence generated by digestion with the AatII restriction enzyme. Hence the DNA sequence tested is flanked by a pair of AatII sites on the resultant pAO plasmid constructs.Fig. 6The AT8 DNA sequence is responsible for gene silencing. Various parts of the 72-bp AT4 DNA were placed at the unique AatII site on pAO and assayed for their gene-silencing effects on the transcription activity mediated from the bla promoter using primer extension. The primer extension results (bla transcription activity) are shown at the bottom of the figure. Each band was quantified against the bla promoter activity on the control plasmid (lane 12), pAO (100%), and reported as gene-silencing activity in the left panel. The relative position of each testing DNA segment is illustrated according to the map of leuO promoter. Those most relevant DNA segments are named and listed in the left panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Characterization of gene silencer AT8-mediated transcriptional repression.

Lanes 1–4, in the absence of LeuO, pAO-AT8, pAO-AT8R, and pAO-(AT8)2 were assayed in the leuO - strain, MF1. Lanes 5 and 6, LeuO was provided in trans (50 μm IPTG induction in the presence of LeuO expression vector pEV101) to investigate LeuO-mediated derepression effects on the LeuO binding site-free gene silencer, AT8, in either orientation. The reported quantification was the average of the results from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pCH plasmid series (see plasmid map in Fig. 8 below) were derived from the pAO plasmid series. Compared with the pAO plasmid series, the pCH plasmid series contains an additional transcription unit that consists of a synthetic promoter (psyn) DNA sequence derived from the consensus sequence of the E. coli σ70 RNA polymerase promoter (reviewed in Ref. 20McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), 5′-CACGGTGTTTGACATTTATCCCTTGCGGCGATATAATTAACGTA-3′. This unit is transcriptionally fused to a Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the coding region of a reporter gene, gfpuv, a variant derived from the green fluorescence gene, gfp, of the jellyfish Aequorea victori (21Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). The nomenclature of the synthetic promoters was based on the number of the base pair match to the -35 and -10 regions of the E. coli promoter consensus DNA sequence. In pCH301, the psyn DNA sequence 5′- CACGGTGTTAGACATTTATCCCTTGCGGCGATAGAATTAACGTA-3′ was named psyn(5/6;5/6) because it carried 5 of the 6 bp of both the -35 consensus sequence (the double-underlined region) and the -10 consensus sequence (the single-underlined region). The remaining consensus DNA sequence, including the 17-bp spacer between the -35 and -10 DNA sequences, remained unmodified. In pCH201, the psyn DNA sequence (5′-CACGGTGTTAGACATTTATCCCTTGCGGCGATAGATTTAACGTA-3′) was named psyn(5/6;4/6) because it carried 5 of the 6 bp of the -35 consensus sequence (the double-underlined region) and 4 of the 6 bp of the -10 consensus sequence (the single-underlined region). In pCH101, the psyn DNA sequence (5′-CACGGTGTGATGATTTTATCCCTTGCGGCGAAGGCCATAACGTA-3′) was named psyn(0/6;0/6) because it carried no matches in both regions. The psyn-controlled reporter gene divergently transcribes away from the β-lactamase gene, bla. Thus the location of the insertion site (the AatII site), where the DNA elements are investigated, is flanked by the divergent transcription units (see plasmid map in Fig. 8 below). Gene-silencing activity was assayed in the E. coli leuO - strain, MF1 (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), harboring one of the testing plasmids. LeuO was provided in trans (+LeuO) by using a pACYC-based LeuO overexpression vector, pEV101, which has been previously described (4Fang M. Wu H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 626-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of LeuO condition (-LeuO) was achieved by replacing pEV101 with pSO1000 (22Oehler S. Eismann E.R. Kramer H. Muller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), the parental plasmid of pEV101, which carries no leuO gene. As previously demonstrated, 50 μm IPTG 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; His10-SLeuO, His-tagged S. typhimurium LeuO; SLeuO, S. typhimurium LeuO; psyn, synthetic promoter; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IHF, integration host factor; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; OD, optical density. induction was used to provide the optimum cellular LeuO concentration for LeuO-mediated derepression (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of LeuO protein in the bacteria harvested under these two testing conditions was confirmed using immunoblotting analyses. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C with aeration unless otherwise indicated. 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline were added as needed. Primer Extension—Primer extension was carried out as previously described (3Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with the following reagents. A DNA oligomer, 5′-TCTGGGTGAGACAAAACAGGAAGGC-3′, consisting of a section of DNA sequence in the coding region of the bla gene, was used as the primer for detecting pbla-mediated transcripts. Another DNA oligomer, 5′-CATCACCATCTAATTCAACAAGAATTGGG-3′, consisting of a section of DNA sequence in the coding region of the gfpuv gene, was used as the primer for detecting psyn-mediated transcripts. Due to the lack of both bla and gfpuv genes on bacterial chromosome, these primers hybridize only with RNA transcripts derived from the testing plasmids so that no transcripts from the chromosomal genes would interfere with the primer extension results. The pbla primer was mixed with 100 μg of total RNAs in all primer extension reactions using pAO plasmid series. Both pbla and psyn primers were mixed with 100 μg of total RNAs in all primer extension reactions using the pCH plasmid series so that transcription activities from pbla and psyn were detected simultaneously. The initiation sites of RNA transcription were verified based on the specific sizes of the primer extension DNA products that are derived from the 5′-end of RNA transcripts. DNA sequence ladders were prepared using the primers to verify the initiation sites at a DNA sequence level. Radioactivity incorporated in the primer extension DNA product was visualized and quantified using a STORM imaging system 840 (Amersham Biosciences). The primer extension signals were normalized based on the total testing plasmid DNA content in the harvested cells. 1.5-ml aliquots of bacterial culture were saved at the harvest and used to prepare total plasmid DNA. The total testing plasmid DNA in the 1.5-ml sample was quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blotting using a 32P-labeled probe that specifically hybridizes with the plasmid DNA. His-tagged S. typhimurium LeuO, His 10 -SLeuO—The full-length S. typhimurium leuO open reading frame was generated from the template DNA, pWU804 (3Wu H.Y. Tan J. Fang M. Cell. 1995; 82: 445-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using primers 5′-GCCGCATCTTTTACATATGGGCAAACC-3′ and 5′-CCTATAAAAATAGGCGTATCACGAGGCCCT-3′ in a PCR reaction. The resultant PCR product contains NdeI (introduced from the base pair modifications in primer; the underlined sequence) and BamHI (the pre-existing single BamHI site in pWU804) restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The PCR product was then digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into corresponding sites in pET16 (Novagen) to generate pET-SL. The construct was sequenced to confirm that the coding region was in-frame with 10 histidine residues at the N terminus. Transformed bacteria BL21(DE3)plysE (23Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) were induced with 1 mm (final concentration) IPTG, and the His10-SLeuO protein was purified over a column packed with Ni2+-charged His·Bind resin (Novagen) as previously described (24Van Dyke M.W. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The purified His10-SLeuO (64.5 μg/μl) was stored at -20 °C in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. The purified His10-SLeuO was used for EMSA and the DNase I footprinting assay. The expression vector, pET-SL, contains a protease (factor Xa) cleavage site located between the polyhistidine tag and the coding region of S. typhimurium leuO. SLeuO (S. typhimurium LeuO) free of the histidine tag was prepared by factor Xa-mediated proteolytic cleavage, which removed the fusion peptides, including the polyhistidine sequence upstream of the cleavage site. The removal of the polyhistidine sequence was confirmed by both the change in gel mobility and the loss of chemiluminescent detection in Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the His tag (Novagen). EMSA—All test DNA segments were annealed pairs of synthetic DNA oligomers consisting of DNA sequence complementary to each other as illustrated in the figures. All synthetic DNA oligomers were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction prior to the annealing. The radioactively labeled duplex DNAs (30 pg per reaction) were then mixed with the purified His10-SLeuO or SLeuO in a binding buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 4 mm MgCl2; 70 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). The binding reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to reach a protein binding equilibrium. The mixtures were then electrophoresed on native polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA). Either 4% or 5% polyacrylamide was used, depending on the size of the DNA duplex under testing. The results were visualized using a STORM imaging system 840 (Amersham Biosciences). DNase I Footprinting Assay—A DNA segment consisting of the 150-bp DNA sequence that includes the promoter and upstream regulatory region (+37 to -112) of S. typhimurium leuO gene was generated using PCR. The entire S. typhimurium DNA sequence relevant to the promoter relay mechanism has been deposited in the NCBI GenBank™ (accession number AF106956). A DdeI restriction site is located at the +37-end of the PCR DNA product. The DdeI-digested 140-bp DNA was uniquely end-labeled by filling the 3-bp DdeI-generated 3′-recessive end with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dTTP plus non-radioactive labeled dCTP and dGTP using the large (Klenow) fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. DNase I (0.4 unit per reaction) was added into reactions containing 1 ng of radioactively labeled DNA (∼10,000 cpm) plus increasing amounts of purified His10-SLeuO or SLeuO. The footprinting reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For preparation of size markers, the radioactively labeled 140-bp DNA was digested separately with either HpaI or BclI or BstXI and then mixed. A G+A marker was also prepared from the radioactively labeled DNA using the Maxim and Gilbert G+A chemical cleavage reaction. Along with the two markers, the DNA products prepared from the footprinting reactions were analyzed on 8% acrylamide/7 m urea denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The result was visualized using a STORM imaging system 840 (Amersham Biosciences). Green Fluorescence Measurement—Bacteria were cultured in M9 Glu+Caa medium consisting of M9 minimal medium plus 1% glucose and 0.2% casamino acids, and 1 μg/ml thiamine (please refer to Ref. 25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. CSH Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-432Google Scholar for the detailed formula) with aeration at 37 °C until the cultures reached the target optical density (OD; A 600 = 0.5). At this point, chloramphenicol was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, and incubation continued with shaking at 37 °C for 1 h. The chloramphenicol treatment was used to stop protein synthesis and to allow the complete folding of the existing green fluorescent protein (GFP). At the end of the 1-h incubation, both OD and GFP fluorescence were measured directly from the bacterial cultures. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences lambda 3B UV-visible spectrophotometer was used for the OD measurements (absorbance at 600 nm). A Bio-Rad VersaFluor™ fluorometer was used for the GFP fluorescence measurement. The excitation wavelength was at 395 nm, and the emission wavelength was at 509 nm. The fluorescence reading was normalized with the OD reading of each sample. The reported fluorescence was the average of data obtained from three independent experiments. A LeuO Binding Site Located within the 72-bp AT4 DNA— LeuO provided in trans relieved (derepressed) AT4 DNA-mediated gene silencing (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because LeuO exerted no transcription effects unless the AT4 DNA was present on the testing plasmid (15Chen C.C. Fang M. Majumder A. Wu H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it was likely that direct binding to the AT4 DNA could be required for LeuO to exert its transcriptional derepression activity. To test this possibility, electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to search for a possible LeuO binding site in the 72-bp AT4 DNA. The 72-bp AT4 DNA was digested with BclI that cleaved the DNA into two DNA fragments, AT7 (25-mer) and AT8 (47-mer), as illustrated in Fig. 2. A mixture of AT7 and AT8 DNA was incubated with an increasing amount of LeuO. The DNA populations (two retarded bands) that exhibited retarded mobility as a function of increasing LeuO concentration were detected in the EMSA (Fig. 2A). The fact that the observed gel mobility retardation pattern (two retarded bands in Fig. 2A) was exactly the same as that seen when the intact AT4 DNA was used in the EMSA (data not shown) indicated that the cleavage at the BclI site did not affect the LeuO binding. Thus, the LeuO binding site must remain intact despite the cleavage by BclI. Furthermore, the retarded mobility of the mixture of DNA fragments was due to LeuO binding with the AT7 DNA fragment rather than the AT8 DNA fragment, because similarly retarded DNA populations (two retarded bands) were found when LeuO was mixed with the purified AT7 DNA (Fig. 2B) but not with the purified AT8 DNA (Fig. 2C). DNase I footprinting assay further confirmed that LeuO indeed bound to the AT7 DNA region (Fig. 3). With increasing LeuO concentration, a DNase I-protected region was found in the upstream regulatory region of the leuO gene (+1 to -104) where the AT4 DNA was naturally located (Fig. 3). The relative positions of AT4 (the shaded box) and the leuO promoter (-35, -10, and +1 DNA sequence) are illustrated in Fig. 3. The LeuO-dependent DNase I protection was located within the AT7 region, which lies at the leuO proximal end of the AT4 DNA. Because the 13-bp region protected from DNase I is at the BclI end of the 25-bp AT7 DNA, we attempted to further narrow down the minimal DNA sequence that was required for the LeuO binding (Fig. 4). Despite the location of the DNase I-protected region at the BclI end of the AT7 DNA, deletion from either end of AT7 DNA equally impaired LeuO binding in the EMSA (see AT7-D1 and AT7-D2 in Fig. 4, C and E). Hence it was likely that the entire imperfect palindrome in the AT7 DNA was responsible for the binding of LeuO. Indeed, a 2-bp mutation that weakened the intrastrand base pairing potential in this palindrome also impaired LeuO binding (compare AT7-M1 in Fig. 4H with AT7 in Fig. 4F). However, the palindromic DNA sequence alone did not fully support LeuO binding, because deleting the 4-bp DNA sequence located outside the palindrome also significantly abolished the LeuO binding (compare AT7-D3 in Fig. 4G with AT7 in Fig. 4F). We, therefore, concluded that the entire 25-bp AT7 DNA sequence is required for LeuO binding. LeuO and AT7 May Form Large Protein·DNA Complexes—We further characterized the newly identified protein·DNA interaction between LeuO and AT7. Interestingly, we observed two important aspects of LeuO binding-mediated DNA retardation: first, the two retarded DNA bands migrated at relatively high positions on the gel; second, the retarded DNA bands were detected when the protein·DNA ratio was high (Figs. 2 and 4). The retarded DNA bands were clearly detected when the LeuO titration had reached 24 ng, which is ∼600 fmol of the His10-SLeuO. Each EMSA reaction contained 30 pg (∼2 fmol) of the DNA. The 300:1 molar ratio suggested a weak affinity of LeuO-AT7 binding. Similar results were observed in the EMSA, and DNase I footprinting experiments using histidine tag free SLeuO (data not shown). Clearly, therefore, the polyhistidine sequence in the fusion protein, His10-SLeuO, does not explain these observations. We investigated further into the possible causes of these unusual characteristics of LeuO-AT7 interaction. We had ruled out the possibility that negative DNA supercoiling might be required to facilitate the LeuO binding. This was evidenced by the insignificant difference in LeuO binding with AT7 DNA element located within either a relaxed or a negatively super-coiled closed circular DNA (data not shown). Further study with a more detailed LeuO titration range (from high to very low amount of LeuO) in an EMSA (Fig. 5), we confirmed that the retarded DNAs (bands E and D in Fig. 5A or the EMSA results in"

We have examined the PDEα and PDEβ mRNA steady-state and protein levels as well as the biosynthesis rate of these proteins in developing and fully differentiated retinas. We have also determined the translational efficiency of PDE subunits and the role of their mRNA structures in regulating protein synthesis. In mature retinas, PDEα and PDEβ are represented by ∼1.5 × 108 and 7.5 × 108 copies/μg retinal mRNA, respectively. The levels of these transcripts in developing photoreceptors (P10) are approximately 75% of those at P30. Quantification of protein concentration indicated that PDEα and PDEβ are equally expressed in developing and fully differentiated photoreceptors. Furthermore, the PDEα/PDEβ ratios obtained throughout a 2-h pulsechase period revealed a similar turnover rate for both subunits. The observed discordance between the mRNA and protein levels of PDEα and PDEβ suggested post-transcriptional regulation of their expression. We found that PDEα mRNA is translated more efficiently than either of the two PDEβ transcripts expressed in retina. Therefore, the lower level of PDEα mRNA is compensated by its more efficient translation to achieve equimolar expression with PDEβ. We also analyzed the effect of PDEα and PDEβ mRNA 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions as well as that of their coding regions on protein synthesis. We determined that the PDE-coding regions play a critical role in the differential translation of these subunits.

Signal transduction in the vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors is mediated by a cascade of protein interactions/activations that lead to hydrolysis of cGMP by a photoreceptor-specific cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; RT, reverse transcriptase; CRS, competitive reference standard; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; UTR, untranslated region; ROS, rod outer segments; IOD, integrated areas of the optical density peaks; NLS, nuclear localization sequence.1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; RT, reverse transcriptase; CRS, competitive reference standard; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; UTR, untranslated region; ROS, rod outer segments; IOD, integrated areas of the optical density peaks; NLS, nuclear localization sequence. followed by closure of the cGMP-gated channels on the plasma membrane (1Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). The catalytic core of cone PDE is composed of two identical α′ subunits, whereas that of the rod enzyme is a heterodimer (PDEα, 88 kDa and PDEβ, 84 kDa) (2Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Deterre B. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although each of these three proteins is encoded by a different gene, they share significant homology in both amino acid and nucleotide sequences. Cone and rod PDEs have similar domain organization and contain two cGMP-binding site motifs, a catalytic site and a CAAX box signal for post-translational modification (4Stroop S. Beavo J.A. Strada S.J. Hidaka H. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research. Vol. 25. Raven Press, Ltd., New, York1992: 55-71Google Scholar). Why the rod holoenzyme consists of two different subunits is still unknown. Based on classical biochemical studies carried out with the bovine rod cGMP-PDE, it has been accepted that PDEα and PDEβ are present in a 1:1 ratio and that they are assembled in a heterodimeric catalytic core (2Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Deterre B. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This coordinated expression of PDEα and PDEβ in rod photoreceptors must be regulated at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level so that a final equimolar ratio of these proteins is achieved. However, there is some indirect evidence suggesting the possibility that the rod PDE catalytic core is not only present as a heterodimer but also as αα and ββ homodimers (6Artemyev N.O. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25382-25388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), similar to cone α′α′ PDE. We have previously demonstrated that the individually expressed catalytic subunits have PDE enzymatic activity (7Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samuel G. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9340-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), supporting the idea of independent catalytic motifs on PDEα and PDEβ. Thus, PDEα and PDEβ may be present in photoreceptor cells at any ratio depending on their expressional “strength.” The proteins of the phototransduction cascade, PDE in particular, have been extensively studied for many years. However, very little is known regarding the regulation of PDEα and PDEβ expression at either the transcriptional or translational level. Although the 5′-flanking regions of PDEα and PDEβ genes have been cloned and sequenced, a detailed analysis that would allow us to speculate about the possible mechanisms of coordinated expression of these genes has not been carried out. A sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking regions of the PDEα and PDEβ revealed two common potential regulatory elements: a Ret1-like site, the binding site for the retina-specific Ret1 transcription factor (8Morabito M.A. Yu X. Barnstable C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9667-9672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a GC box, the binding site for the SP family of transcription factors. Work coming out from our laboratory has implicated Sp4 in the transcriptional regulation of PDEβ (9Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E. Ji M. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34999-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Lerner L.E. Gribanova Y.E. Whitaker L. Knox B.E. Farber D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25877-25883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but the effect of this factor on PDEα has not yet been established. This study was initiated with the intention of: 1) determining the PDEα and PDEβ mRNA steady-state levels as well as protein levels in the mouse retina at different stages of photoreceptor development; 2) examining the turnover of translated PDEα and PDEβ by pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation to determine whether the final stoichiometric amounts of the catalytic subunits are the result of differences in either efficiency of translation or post-translational protein stability; and 3) determining the PDEα and PDEβ mRNA translational efficiency and the role of their 5′-UTRs, coding regions, and 3′-UTRs in protein synthesis. RNA Isolation and in Vitro Transcription—Total RNA was extracted from 10- and 30-day-old normal mouse retinas using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). mRNA was isolated using the mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Concentrations of the RNA samples were determined by measuring their optical density. For in vitro transcription, the cDNAs were subcloned into the pGEM3Z vector (Promega, Madison, WI) between BamHI and SalI. In vitro transcription was performed using 1 μg of linearized DNA and the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The length and the concentration of the synthesized transcripts were determined by running an aliquot on a denaturing agarose gel as recommended by Ambion. Quantification of the samples was performed using the two-dimensional spot densitometry program of the Alpha Imager 2000 (Alpha Innotec, San Leandro, CA). RT-PCR Analysis—First strand cDNA was synthesized using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.75 mm of antisense primer, 1 mm dNTPs, 10 units of RNAsin (Promega), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 50 mm KCl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 15 min. PCR was performed with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.75 mm antisense and sense primers, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 50 mm KCl. The PCR profile time and temperature were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 57 °C for 1 min 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. Quantitative Northern Blot and Quantitative RT-PCR—mRNAs (2 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences), cross-linked, and hybridized with random-labeled PDEα and PDEβ cDNA fragments. Autoradiographs were analyzed using the two-dimensional spot densitometry program of the Alpha Imager 2000 to determine the intensity of the hybridization signals. Quantification of the PDEβ transcripts differing by the length of their 5′-UTRs was based on the PCR method described by Riedy et al. (11Riedy M.C. Timm Jr., E.A. Stewart C.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar). A competitive reference standard RNA (RNA-CRS) was obtained as follows: cDNA fragments with a 75-nucleotide deletion were synthesized by PCR using primers MB7 (5′-CGGGATCCTGCAGAATCCATGTGTACC-3′) and MB45 (5′-TGCGGTCGACAGGATCTTGAAGACCACACGTTCCAAGGCTGCCACAGTCCGCCAG-3′) and full-length PDEβ as template. The resulting product was subcloned into the pGEM3Z vector between BamHI and SalI, and the RNA-CRS was synthesized using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit as described above. Total retinal RNA and serial dilutions of RNA-CRS were used in RT-PCR with appropriate primer pairs (MB4 5′-TGCAGAATCCATGTGTACCTGGGGG-3′ and MB25 5′-AGGATCTTGAAGACCACACGTTCCA-3′ for amplification of the long PDEβ transcript and MB5 5′-ACAGCAGCAGGAACACCATGAGCCT-3′ and MB25 for both the long and short transcripts) to obtain data for mRNA quantification curves. Conditions for RT-PCR were the same as described above. Aliquots from each reaction were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel and stained with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide, and the bands were quantified using the spot densitometry function of the Alpha Imager 2000. Since the RNA-CRS cDNA is smaller in size than the wild type cDNA, the decrease in ethidium bromide incorporation was taken into account by using a correction equation (12Menzo S. Bannarelli P. Giacca M. Manzin A. Varaldo P.E. Clementi M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1992; 30: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Translation—Equal amounts of in vitro synthesized RNAs were used for all of the in vitro translation studies. In vitro translation reactions were performed in the presence of l-[35S]methionine with the retic lysate IVT kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Translation products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6.5% acrylamide, 1.5% bis-acrylamide) using the Tris-Tricine buffer system as previously described (13Tsang S.H. Gouras P. Yamashita C.K. Kjeldbye H. Fisher J. Farber D.B. Goff S.P. Science. 1996; 272: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The gels were then fixed, stained with Coomassie Blue G-250, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Proteins were quantified by densitometry of the autoradiograph or direct scintillation counting of the excised bands. RNA Secondary Structure Prediction and Analysis—5′-UTRs of PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs were analyzed for the presence of stem-loop structures using the RNA Secondary Structure Prediction Program of Genebee Services (www.genebee.msu.su/services/rna2_reduced.html) that determines the most stable structures and their free energy level. PSORT II (psort.nibb.ac.jp/), SubLoc v1.0 (www.bioinfo.tsinghua-.edu.cn/SubLoc/), and the Predict NLS (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predict-NLS/) were used to determine subcellular localization of the PDEα and PDEβ subunits. Preparation of Mouse Rod Outer Segments (ROS) and Immunoblot Analysis—An analysis of the stoichiometric amounts of PDEα and PDEβ subunits was performed on retinas from 10- and 30-day-old animals and on sealed ROS isolated from 48 adult (greater than 30 days of age) C57/Bl retinas by sucrose gradient centrifugation according to the method of Papermaster (14Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Proteins (50 μg of total protein/lane from retinal homogenates and 8 μg of total protein/lane from ROS) were separated by Tris-Tricine-buffered inverted gradient gel electrophoresis (13Tsang S.H. Gouras P. Yamashita C.K. Kjeldbye H. Fisher J. Farber D.B. Goff S.P. Science. 1996; 272: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (15Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in either 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) or 0.3% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for colloidal gold staining. Immunoblots were incubated with a polyclonal peptide antiserum (αT1) previously characterized (7Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samuel G. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9340-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the signal was amplified with a goat anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody and AvidinD/biotin-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Blots were visualized with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) on Hyperfilm-MP pre-flashed according to the Sensitize™ protocol (Amersham Biosciences) to increase the range of film exposure linearity. Films were developed and scanned densitometrically on a Pharmacia/LKB XL densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Mice were sacrificed at 10 post-natal days (according to the guidelines of the UCLA Committee on Animal Research and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research) and enucleated, and the eyes were hemisected. The resulting eyecups were incubated in HEPES-buffered Medium 199 with Hanks' salts without dl-methionine (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 95% O2, 5% CO2 incubator to methionine-deplete the tissue. The eyecups were then incubated with l-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol and 100 μCi/ml media, Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h and subsequently washed and incubated in fresh Medium 199 supplemented with cold l-methionine at 500 μm final concentration. At the appropriate times, eyecups were removed and the retinas were dissected and immediately frozen at –80 °C on dry ice to prevent further incorporation of label and protein degradation. Retinas were homogenized with hypotonic buffer, and aliquots were removed to determine trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts and protein concentration by the method of Peterson (16Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (17Farber D.B. Park S. Yamashita C. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 4: 363-374Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal rod cGMP-PDE-specific antiserum, MOE (18Fung B.K.K. Griswold-Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3133-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by a Tris-Tricine-buffered inverted gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel as described previously (13Tsang S.H. Gouras P. Yamashita C.K. Kjeldbye H. Fisher J. Farber D.B. Goff S.P. Science. 1996; 272: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) for 22 h at 35 mA constant current. Proteins were then blotted to nitrocellulose membrane, stained with Aurodye total protein stain (Bio-Rad), and exposed to autoradiography on pre-flashed Hyperfilm-MP. Quantification of PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs by Northern Blot Hybridization—This method for absolute quantification of specific mRNAs is based on the generation of a standard curve using known amounts of an external standard (synthetic sense strand RNA with identical sequence to the target mRNA) and interpolation of the concentration of the target mRNA from the curve. The external standards for PDEα and PDEβ mRNA quantification were synthesized in vitro from constructs containing full-length PDEα and PDEβ cDNAs. mRNA samples isolated from 10- and 30-day-old mouse retinas were hybridized with the random-labeled PDEα and PDEβ cDNA fragments. Two transcripts with molecular masses of 3.0 and 2.8 kb corresponding to the PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs, respectively, were hybridized. Using the external standard curve, we determined that in the 30-day-old mouse retina the level of PDEα transcript was 1.5 ± 0.05 ng and that of PDEβ transcript was 0.34 ± 0.02 ng/1 μg of retinal mRNA (Fig. 1). Based on the molecular masses of PDEα and PDEβ transcripts (1.03 × 106 and 0.87 × 106, respectively) we estimated that 1 μg of retinal mRNA contains ∼1.5 × 108 (±0.2 × 108) and 7.5 × 108 (±0.5 × 108) PDEα and PDEβ transcripts, respectively. Similar quantification carried out with mRNA samples of 10-day-old mouse retina (Fig. 1) showed that at this age the concentration of PDEα and PDEβ transcripts is ∼75% of that in the 30-day-old retina. The levels reported are the average of those determined in three different experiments. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of mRNAs—It had been reported previously (19Di Polo A. Rickman C.B. Farber D.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar) that mouse PDEβ has two different transcription start sites represented in the retina by two transcripts, one with a 59-nucleotide 5′-UTR and the other with a 34-nucleotide 5′-UTR. Because the 5′-UTR is a major element implicated in mRNA translation, the two PDEβ transcripts could have different translation initiation strengths. Therefore, any changes in the molar ratio of these transcripts during the development of photoreceptor cells could be responsible for modulation of PDEβ protein concentration. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the level of the PDEβ transcript with long 5′-UTR and the total concentration of PDEβ mRNA (the sum of the long and short transcripts) in the 10- and 30-day-old mouse retina. This technique involves the use of an RNA-CRS that is identical in sequence to the wild type mRNA with the exception of an internal nucleotide deletion. Primers MB4 and MB25 were used to amplify the long transcript, and primers MB5 and MB25 were used to amplify at the same time both the long and the short transcripts. PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and analyzed densitometrically (Fig. 2, Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb). The concentration of the RNA-CRS (x axis) was plotted versus the ratio of the RNA-CRS to the wild type mRNA band densities (Fig. 2, Ic and IIc, y axis). The concentration of PDEβ mRNA corresponds to the point on the x axis where the ratio RNA-CRS:PDEβ mRNA is 1. The results of these experiments indicate that both long and short PDEβ transcripts are represented at equimolar concentrations in the photoreceptor cells of the 10- and 30-day-old animals. Western Blot Analysis—Given the 5-fold difference in transcript abundance observed by quantitative Northern blots, we had to establish the protein subunit stoichiometry in the mouse retina. We accomplished this by utilizing αT1, an antibody that recognizes the same epitope on both PDEα and PDEβ. The relative amounts of PDEα and PDEβ were obtained by determining the corresponding integrated areas of the optical density peaks (IOD) and then the ratio of PDEα IOD to PDEβ IOD (Fig. 3). Ratios of ∼1:1 were obtained for all three of the samples analyzed, confirming equimolar expression of PDEα and PDEβ subunits in mouse rod photoreceptors, similar to what is seen for the bovine enzyme. Biosynthesis and Turnover—Using l-[35S]methionine, we performed pulse-chase labeling of newly synthesized PDE subunits followed by immunoprecipitation with a specific polyclonal rod cGMP-PDE antiserum to confirm that the differences observed between protein and corresponding mRNA levels were the result of differential protein translation and/or turnover. The autoradiograph of the gel containing the immunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 4) was scanned densitometrically, and the IODs were obtained. The rate of l-[35S]methionine incorporation was higher for PDEα than PDEβ as indicated by values greater than 1.0 throughout the course of the experiment for the PDEα/PDEβ-calculated IOD ratios. However, the range of observed IOD ratios from 1.20 to 1.41 suggests that the turnover rate for PDEβ is not significantly greater than for PDEα, particularly when the difference in the molar methionine content of PDEα and PDEβ, 34 residues and 29 residues, respectively, is taken into account. Translational Efficiency of the Full-length PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs—To determine the translational efficiency of the PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs, three constructs were prepared by subcloning the PDEα and PDEβ (B5s and B5l) cDNAs into the pGEM3Z vector (Fig. 5, Ia). The PDEβ subunit is represented by two constructs since mouse photoreceptor cells express two PDEβ transcripts that differ in the length of their 5′-UTRs. Capped mRNAs were in vitro transcribed from the A, B5s, and B5l templates, transcripts were quantified by both spectrophotometry and spot densitometry, and equal amounts of each mRNA were used for in vitro translation in the presence of l-[35S]methionine. As a first step in the analysis of the translational efficiency of PDEα and PDEβ, we determined the approximate linear range of protein synthesis and the relative stability of the corresponding mRNAs in the reticulocyte lysate. In pilot studies, the in vitro translation reactions with A, B5s, and B5l mRNAs were incubated for 20, 40, or 60 min. The RNA from each reaction was then extracted and analyzed by slot-blot hybridization. No noticeable mRNA degradation was observed during incubation for up to 60 min. Synthesized proteins were separated by PAGE, and their amount was determined by measuring l-[35S]methionine incorporation. The results obtained showed that at 60 min but not after 20 or 40 min of incubation, protein synthesis reached saturation. Based on these observations, all of the reactions for quantitative analysis were performed for 30 min. mRNA synthesized from constructs A, B5s, and B5l yielded products with the expected molecular masses of 88 and 84 kDa, corresponding to PDEα and PDEβ, respectively, but exhibited differential translational efficiency (Fig. 5, Ib). The synthesized PDEα was ∼4.5-fold more abundant than PDEβ synthesized from the short transcript (B5s) and 5.0-fold more abundant than PDEβ produced from the long transcript (B5l) (Fig. 5, Ib and Ic). A low level of protein synthesis from B5l was anticipated since this mRNA contains in the 5′-UTR an upstream AUG known to have a negative effect on translation. Thus, constructs A, B5s, and B5l enabled us to determine the differences in PDEα and PDEβ protein synthesis efficiency resulting from the contribution of the full-length mRNAs. The input of the coding regions and 5′- and 3′-UTRs of each of these mRNAs in the differential translation of PDEα and PDEβ was assessed in the experiments described below. The Role of the 5′-UTR in PDEα and PDEβ mRNA Translation—The 5′-UTR is known to be an essential factor in determining the rate of translation initiation (20Day D.A. Tuite M.F. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 157: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 21van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and consequently the overall protein synthesis efficiency. We hypothesized that if the 5′-UTRs of PDEα or PDEβ were solely responsible for the observed differences in efficiency of translation, the exchange of these regions between the subunits would lead to opposite results to those obtained with the original A, B5s, and B5l constructs. That is, the exchange of 5′-UTRs would produce approximately 5 times more PDEβ than PDEα. However, the chimeric constructs shown in Fig. 5, IIa, gave results different from what was expected. The amount of protein synthesized using construct A5B (containing PDEα 5′-UTR, PDEβ-coding region, and 3′-UTR) was ∼5.5-fold lower than that produced by the native PDEα transcript (construct A) and slightly less than that produced by B5s or B5l (Fig. 5, IIb and IIc and Ia, Ib, and Ic). In contrast, the placement of the PDEβ short 5′-UTR in front of the PDEα-coding region and 3′-UTR (construct B5sA) resulted in greater protein synthesis than that produced by the original A (∼2-fold), B5s (∼8-fold), or B5l (∼10-fold) constructs. Similarly, the placement of the PDEβ long 5′-UTR in front of the PDEα-coding region and 3′-UTR (construct B5lA) also increased protein synthesis above the levels produced by the native mRNAs, although this construct was ∼1.8-fold less efficient than B5sA with the PDEβ short 5′-UTR. This reduction in efficiency of translation of construct B5lA when compared with B5sA is possibly due to the presence of the AUG upstream of the translation initiation site. These experiments clearly demonstrated the negative impact of the PDEα 5′-UTR on the rate of protein synthesis. The Effect of a Non-consensus Translation Initiation Sequence and of the Upstream AUG in the 5′-UTR on PDEβ mRNA Translation—It has been shown that both the absence of a “strong” translation initiation sequence (22Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 23Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar, 24Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and the presence of an upstream AUG (25Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) can result in lower protein synthesis efficiency. In addition to the upstream AUG in its long 5′-UTR, the PDEβ mRNA translation initiation sequence is not in absolute agreement with the Kozak consensus sequence (there is an A instead of G at the +4 position). To find out whether these sequences have a negative effect on PDEβ translation, three new constructs were created by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 5, IIIa). Two of the constructs, B5sM and B5lM, were obtained by replacing the A at the +4 position of PDEβ mRNA with G, creating in this way the consensus translation initiation sequence. As expected, the amount of protein synthesized from the mutated short transcript was ∼2.6-fold higher than that obtained from B5s mRNA (Fig. 5, IIIb and IIIc and Ib and Ic). Thus, the absence of a Kozak sequence reduces translational efficiency of PDEβ. However, the A to G mutation at the +4 position in the transcript with the long 5′-UTR did not affect its translational rate. This may again be attributed to the presence of the upstream AUG in the long 5′-UTR. To test this possibility, we generated the third construct, B5lM2, by mutating the upstream AUG of the long PDEβ transcript to AAG. Indeed, protein synthesis from this construct was 2.2 times more abundant than that from the wild type B5l transcript (Fig. 5, Ib and Ic and IIIb and IIIc). The Role of the 3′-UTRs in PDEα and PDEβ Translation Efficiency—Along with the 5′-UTR, the 3′-UTR is emerging as another important mRNA sequence controlling its translation (28Jackson R.J. Standart N. Cell. 1990; 62: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 29Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 30Stuart J.J. Egry L.A. Wong G.H. Kaspar R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of the PDEα and PDEβ mRNA 3′-UTR on protein synthesis, three chimeras were constructed by exchanging the 3′-UTRs of constructs A and B5s or B5l (Fig. 5, IVa). AB3 was translated only 1.3 times more efficiently than construct A. In contrast, the placement of PDEα 3′-UTR in the B5sA3 construct increased protein production by close to 3-fold (Fig. 5, IVb and IVc and Ib and Ic). However, protein synthesis by B5lA3 construct was similar to that produced by B5l, again suggesting a repressing effect of the upstream AUG in the long PDEβ 5′-UTR. Swapping 3′-UTRs between PDE subunits did not reverse their translational efficiency, i.e. protein synthesis from PDEα mRNA was greater than that from PDEβ. A comparison of the levels of protein synthesized from all of the constructs described in this study demonstrates that those with the PDEα-coding region, regardless of which flanking 5′- or 3′-UTR they may contain, produce more protein than any construct with the PDEβ-coding region. As a first step toward understanding the mechanisms of PDEα and PDEβ gene expression, we determined the steady-state levels of PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs and examined the biosynthesis/turnover of the translated PDEα and PDEβ in the developing and fully differentiated mouse retina. Our results indicate that the mRNA for PDEβ at both 10- and 30-post-natal days is ∼5-fold more abundant than the mRNA for PDEα. Despite the fact that the PDEα:PDEβ mRNA ratio we observed by quantitative Northern analysis is larger than that observed by Phelan and Bok (31Phelan J.K. Bok B. Exp. Eye. Res. 2000; 71: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) in 10-day-old mouse retinas using quantitative RT-PCR (this variability could be due to the different techniques used to determine the mRNA levels), both studies as well as results from Y79 cells (32Di Polo A. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4016-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) indicate a higher number of transcripts for PDEβ than for PDEα. In contrast, the examination of protein levels showed equimolar expression and similar turnover rates of PDEα and PDEβ subunits. This discordance between PDEα and PDEβ steady-state mRNA and protein levels suggested that photoreceptor cells must have a mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of PDE expression. In this study, we were able to conclusively demonstrate that PDEα mRNA is translated ∼5 times more efficiently than its PDEβ counterpart. Thus, the low level of PDEα mRNA found in retina could be counterbalanced by its efficient translation if PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs are translated in photoreceptor cells with a similar efficiency to that we observed in vitro. Our data also point to possible regulation of PDE expression in photoreceptor cells by the feedback mechanism, i.e. if one of the subunits is being translated in excess it could by itself or through interaction with other factors stimulate or inhibit transcription of the less or more abundant subunit mRNA, respectively. This regulatory mechanism would require translocation of transcription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Alternatively, signals could be delivered from the cytosol to the nucleus by protein kinases that would activate transcription factors by phosphorylation. It has been shown that proteins with a molecular size of <50 kDa can freely enter the nucleus but that larger proteins must have a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that is recognized by the members of the importin/karyopherin superfamily. The complex between importin/karyopherin and the NLS-containing protein can then be actively transported through the nuclear pore complex (33Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Jans D.A. Xiao C.-Y. Lam M.H.C. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To check the possibility of PDE subunits (PDEα, 88 kDa and PDEβ, 84 kDa) directly regulating their own transcription, we analyzed these proteins using Predict NLS: Prediction and Analysis of NLSs, PSORT II: Prediction of Protein Sorting Signals and Localization Sites in Amino Acid Sequences, and SubLoc (Version 1.0): Subcellular Localization Prediction of Eukaryotic Proteins. This analysis predicted no nuclear localization of PDEα and PDEβ and revealed no potential NLS in their sequences, suggesting that the proposed feedback mechanism would require the involvement of other factors regulating their transcription. After determining the translational efficiency of PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs, we evaluated the roles of their 5′- and 3′-UTRs known to be involved in controlling protein synthesis as well as that of their coding sequences on this process. Since neither of the 5′-UTRs of PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs contains stable secondary structures that can reduce the rate of protein synthesis, we first hypothesized that the presence of an upstream AUG and the absence of a strong initiation sequence in the 5′-UTR of PDEβ mRNA could account for its lower protein synthesis efficiency. Indeed, when the upstream AUG was mutated and the consensus translation initiation sequence in the PDEβ mRNA was restored, the protein production was increased. However, using several chimeric constructs, we demonstrated that in fact the 5′-UTR of PDEα leads to lower protein synthesis than the 5′-UTR of PDEβ mRNA. Therefore, the differential translation of the PDE subunits cannot be explained by the differences in the primary or secondary structures of their 5′-UTRs. The results of our studies undoubtedly implicate the involvement of the coding regions in the differential translation of PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs. All of the eight constructs containing the PDEβ-coding region resulted in lower protein expression than the four constructs containing the PDEα-coding region, regardless of the flanking 5′-or3′-UTR they had. Regulation of protein synthesis by the mRNA-coding region is not a widespread phenomenon. One example of this type of regulation is provided by the response of HSP70 to a heat shock, which involves an increase of the elongation rate (35Theodorakis N.G. Banerji S.S. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14579-14585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that some mRNAs contain in the coding region secondary structures that lead to “ribosomal pause” (36Jansen M. de Moor C.H. Sussenbach J.S. van den Brande J.L Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Liebhaber et al. (37Liebhaber S.A. Cash F. Eshleman S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have shown that extensive secondary structures in the coding region suppresses translation to a minimal or to a substantial degree depending on the distance of these structures from the initiation codon. Coding region duplexes in close proximity to the AUG dramatically suppress translation, whereas duplexes further downstream in the coding region have a milder effect on protein synthesis. We have analyzed PDEα and PDEβ mRNAs for the presence of stable secondary structures. The overall ΔG of PDEα mRNA is –680.7 kcal/mol, and the most stable structure (ΔG = –17.8 kcal/mol) proximal to the initiation codon is created by the coding region sequences 5′-GAGGAGGT-3′ (position +15 to +22) and 5′-CTCCTCCA-3′ (position +107 to +100). Structures with lower ΔG (–20.4 and –20.3 kcal/mol) are located ∼900 and 1800 nucleotides from the AUG start codon, respectively. The total free energy of the PDEβ mRNA is –593.4 kcal/mol. It has six structures with ΔGs ranging from –19.0 to –23.5 kcal/mol. One of these structures (ΔG = –19.0 kcal/mol) is in very close proximity to the AUG start codon and involves sequences 5′-GGCACAGC-3′ (position –20 to –13 in the 5′-UTR) and 5′-CCGTGTCG-3′ (+164 to +147 in the coding region). It will be interesting to determine the involvement of these predicted structures in the regulation of PDE translation. In summary, our results indicate that the low level of PDEα mRNA found in retina can be compensated by its more efficient translation to achieve equimolar expression with PDEβ. Moreover, our results indicate that the PDEα- and PDEβ-coding regions are responsible for the differential expression of these subunits.

J. (2000) Traffic 1, 702–712). The released vesicles lack anterograde-directed cargo but contain coat protein I (COPI) and the recycling protein p53/p58, suggesting that the vesicles traffic in the retrograde pathway. In this study, we have directly characterized the role of PKCι/λ in the early secretory pathway. A peptide corresponding to the unique PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate domain was introduced into an in vitro assay that efficiently reconstitutes transport of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cis-medial Golgi compartments. This peptide blocked transport in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, normal rat kidney cells incubated with Rab2 and the pseudosubstrate peptide displayed abundant swollen or dilated vesicles that contained Rab2, PKCι/λ, β-COP, and p53/p58. Because Rab2, β-COP, and p53/p58 are marker proteins for pre-Golgi intermediates (vesicular tubular clusters,VTCs), most probably the swollen vesicles are derived from VTCs. Similar results were obtained when the assays were supplemented with kinase-dead PKCι/λ (W274K). Both the pseudosubstrate peptide and kinase-dead PKCι/λ in tandem with Rab2 caused sustained membrane association of PKCι/λ, suggesting that reverse translocation was inhibited. Importantly, the inhibitory phenotype of kinase-dead PKCι/λ was reversed by PKCι/λ wild type. These combined results indicate that PKCι/λ is essential for protein transport in the early secretory pathway and suggest that PKCι/λ kinase activity is required to promote Rab2-mediated vesicle budding at a VTC subcompartment enriched in recycling cargo.

Stribling S. Obeid L. Hannun Y. Parker P. Pawson T. Cell Signalling. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 213-249Google Scholar). The different isoenzymes probably possess unique functional properties since activation results in their translocation from the cytosol to distinct intracellular sites including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex (2Parker P. Kour G. Marais R. Mitchell F. Pears C. Schaap D. Stabel S. Webster C. Mol. Cell. Endocr. 1989; 65: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 3Nishizuka Y.

PKC association with these organelles suggests that the kinase is a potential regulator of membrane traffic. In that regard, we have recently reported that PKCι/λ is essential for Rab2-stimulated β-coat protein (β-COP) recruitment to membranes (5Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rab2 required PKCι/λ kinase activity to generate vesicles enriched in PKCι/λ, β-COP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and p53/p58 from normal rat kidney cell (NRK) microsomes (5Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PKCι/λ is a member of the atypical subgroup of PKC that includes PKCζ. Unlike the other PKC isoforms, the atypical members do not contain the calcium binding domain and possess only one cysteine-rich region. The atypical subgroups of PKC are activated by the lipid mediator phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and phosphatidic acid as well as by protein-protein interactions that direct the PKC in proximity of its cognate substrate (6Farese R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E1-E11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These specific interactions are necessary for the selective regulation of the different PKC isoforms. This subfamily of kinases plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and cell survival. The atypical subgroup of PKC binds proteins, which function as scaffolds that ultimately link signaling cascades with cytoskeletal rearrangement (7Berra E. Diaz-Meco M. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci.

Since it was important to determine the PKCι/λ substrate(s) that potentiated Rab2 activity in vesicle formation, studies were initiated to identify the phosphorylated protein(s). We found that GAPDH was efficiently phosphorylated by PKCι/λ and that GAPDH interacts directly with PKCι/λ through its regulatory domain (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PKCι/λ-mediated phosphorylation of GAPDH is prevented by the peptide encoding for the unique pseudosubstrate region of PKCι/λ (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The pseudosubstrate or autoinhibitory domain is present in the regulatory domain of all of the PKC isozymes and maintains phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1-phosphorylated and autophosphorylated cytosolic PKC in an inactive conformation by blocking the protein-substrate binding site (11Dutil E. Newton A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Translocation of this catalytically competent but inactive PKC to membrane results in the removal of the pseudosubstrate domain, allowing substrate access to the active site and its subsequent phosphorylation. The same consequence of kinase inactivation occurs in the presence of peptidomimetics of the pseudosubstrate sequence. In fact, pseudosubstrate peptides have been used successfully to determine the substrate specificity of PKC as well as to define the biological response of the phosphorylated substrate (12Alexander D. Hexham J. Lucas S. Graves J. Cantrell D. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Eichholtz T. Alblas J. Overveld M. Moolenaar W. Ploegh H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Ward N. O'Brian C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Unlike most PKC inhibitors that interfere with the function of multiple kinases, these peptides have the advantage of specifically interfering with the activity of a particular PKC isozyme because of the fact that the pseudosubstrate amino acid sequence differs considerably among the subfamilies (15Hug H. Sarre T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). In this study, we directly characterized the role of PKCι/λ in the early secretory pathway by introducing a synthetic peptide corresponding to the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate region into a battery of biochemical and morphological assays. We found that this peptide was a potent inhibitor of VSV-G transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. Permeabilized NRK cells treated with Rab2 and the PKCι/λ peptide accumulated dilated vesicular structures that labeled with an antibody to PKCι/λ, Rab2, p53/p58, and β-COP but contained a negligible amount of VSV-G. Based on our previous findings, this labeling profile is highly suggestive that the swollen vesicular structures are a Rab2-regulated VTC subcompartment. A quantitative microsomal binding assay indicated that membranes incubated with Rab2 and the pseudosubstrate peptide showed a constant level of membrane-associated PKCι/λ, indicating that reverse translocation of the kinase was delayed. Because the pseudosubstrate peptide prohibits PKCι/λ-dependent phosphorylation and Rab2-mediated retrograde-vesicle formation and therefore mimics the effect of kinase-dead PKCι/λ (W274K), we characterized the PKCι/λ mutant in the transport and morphological assay. The kinase-dead mutant blocked VSV-G transport to the Golgi complex. Furthermore, permeabilized NRK cells incubated with the PKCι/λ mutant contained vesicles similar to those observed in cells treated with the pseudosubstrate peptide. Importantly, PKCι/λ wild type markedly reversed the inhibition in VSV-G transport and the phenotype produced by kinase-dead PKCι/λ. We propose that Rab2 stimulates PKCι/λ recruitment to a VTC subcompartment. The PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide causes the sustained binding of PKCι/λ to pre-Golgi intermediates by preventing reverse translocation that requires functional PKCι/λ kinase activity (16Feng X. Becker K. Stribling S. Peters K. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Signorelli P. Luberto C. Hannun Y. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2401-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The VTC subcompartment becomes “swollen” because Rab2-mediated retrograde-vesicle release is blocked in the absence of kinase activity by PKCι/λ (K274W) or inhibition by the pseudosubstrate peptide. This causes VTCs to be stalled in their forward movement to the Golgi complex because of the inability to recycle proteins to the ER and transfer anterograde-directed cargo to the late compartments of the secretory pathway. Materials and Methods—PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide (SIYRRGARRWRKLYCAN), scrambled PKCι/λ peptide (WRICGNKARLRRYYSAR), PKCα pseudosubstrate peptide (RFARKGALRQKNVHEVKD), and PKCγ pseudosubstrate peptide (LFCRKGALRQKVVHEVK) were synthesized at the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure facility (Ann Arbor, MI). The cDNA to PKCι was a gift from Dr. Trevor Biden (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia). Dr. Alan Tartakoff (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) provided the monoclonal antibody (6F4C5) to the Golgi complex. Analysis of Transport in Vitro—NRK cells were infected for 4 h with the temperature-sensitive VSV strain ts045 and then biosynthetically radiolabeled with 100 μCi of trans-[35S] (specific activity 1192 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for 10 min at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) to accumulate the VSV-G mutant protein in the ER. The cells were then perforated by swelling and scraping and were employed in the ER to cis-medial Golgi transport assay as described previously (18Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transport reactions were performed in a final volume of 40 μl in a buffer that contains 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 75 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2,1mm N-acetylglucosamine, an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase), 5 μl of rat liver cytosol (∼25–30 μg of total protein), and 5 μl of semi-intact cells (∼5 × 107 cells/ml) resuspended in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, and 90 mm KOAc, pH 7.2. The reactions were incubated at 32 °C for 60 min, and then transferred to ice to terminate transport. Membranes were pelleted, solubilized in buffer, digested with endoglycosidase H (endo H), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The fraction of ts045 VSV-G protein processed to the endo H-resistant forms was quantitated by a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Morphological Assay, Indirect Immunofluorescence—NRK cells plated on coverslips were infected with ts045 at 39.5 °C for 2–3 h and then shifted to ice and permeabilized with digitonin (20 μg/ml) as outlined previously (19Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Coverslips with permeabilized cells were inverted and placed in tissue culture wells that contained the transport mixture described above, preincubated on ice for 15 min without or with Rab2 and PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide, His6-PKCι/λ wild type, or His6-PKCι/λ (K274W), and then incubated for 40 min at 32 °C. To terminate transport, the cells were transferred to ice and fixed in 3% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. To detect intracellular VSV-G, cells were re-permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS, 5% normal goat serum for 10 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 30 min with a monoclonal antibody specific for the VSV-G protein cytoplasmic tail (P5D4) (Sigma) or with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to β-COP (EAGE) (21Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or a polyclonal antibody to p53/p58 (22Tisdale E.J. Plutner H. Matteson J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or a monoclonal antibody to PKCι/λ (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or an anti-His-Tag (27E8) monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Rab2. Cells were then washed with PBS, stained for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 549 chicken anti-rabbit antibody or Alexa Fluor 488 chicken anti-mouse antibody, washed, mounted in Prolong antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and then viewed by Confocal light microscopy with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (LSM 510) located at the John D. Dingle Veterans Administration Medical Center (Detroit, MI). The lasers and available lines are as follows: Enterprise (UV, 351 and 364 nm), Argon (458, 488, and 514 nm), HeNe1 (543 nm), and HeNe2 (633 nm). The confocal microscope was operated with pin-hole settings between 1.1 and 1.4 Airy units in each of the fluorescence channels. Images were recorded at 2048 × 2048 pixels × 12 bits/channel and then viewed and converted to TIFF using the Zeiss LSM Viewer software and processed for printing with Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Quantitative Membrane Binding Assay—NRK cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman into 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 250 mm mannitol and then broken with 15 passes through a 27-gauge syringe. The broken cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was re-centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing ER, pre-Golgi, and Golgi membranes was washed with 1 m KCl in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 250 mm mannitol and employed in the binding reaction as described previously (21Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Membranes (30 μg of total protein) were added to a reaction mixture that contained 27.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2.75 mm MgOAc, 65 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 units of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide and Rab2 protein were added to obtain the final concentration as indicated under “Results,” and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. Rat liver cytosol (50 μg) and 2.0 μm GTPγS were then added, and the reactions shifted to 37 °C and incubated for 10 min. The binding reaction was terminated by transferring the samples to ice and then was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline, which contained 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20, incubated with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody made to the EAGE peptide of β-COP (21Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or a monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or a monoclonal antibody to PKCι/λ (Transduction Laboratories) or an anti-phosphoserine monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem), washed, further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Pierce), developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and then quantitated by densitometry. Purification of Recombinant Wild Type and Kinase-dead PKCι/λ— The transient expression of PKCι/λ and PKCι/λ (K274W) was performed as described previously (24Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (3 × 106/10 cm dish × 5) were infected with a vaccinia T7 RNA polymerase recombinant virus (vTF7-3) for 30 min and then transfected with 20 μg of pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO PKCι/λ wild type or PKCι/λ (K274W), which had been premixed in LipofectACE (Invitrogen). 8 h post-transfection, the cells were detached from the dish with PBS/EDTA and washed once with 10/18 (10 mm KOAc, 18 mm Hepes, pH 7.2). The cells were resuspended in 10/18 containing protease inhibitors (10 μm aprotinin, 10 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 μg/ml chymotrypsin, 0.1 μm pepstatin), swollen on ice for 10 min, and then homogenized by 20 passes through a 27-gauge needle after which the concentration was adjusted to 25 mm KOAc, 125 mm Hepes. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g, and the post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a micro-ultracentrifuge system (Sorval, Discovery M120). The supernatant that contained overexpressed His6/Xpress-tagged PKCι/λ and PKCι/λ (K274W) was then applied to a 2-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) equilibrated in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm imidazole). The column was washed with 10 volumes of Buffer A containing 8 mm imidazole. The tagged protein was eluted with Buffer A supplemented with 80 mm imidazole. An aliquot of the collected fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). His6/Xpress-tagged PKCι/λ and PKCι/λ (K274W) enriched fractions were pooled and concentrated, and the protein concentration was determined by Micro BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Purification of recombinant Rab2 and in vitro prenylation was performed as described previously (25Tisdale E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PKCι/λ Pseudosubstrate Peptide Inhibits ER to Golgi Transport—Although PKC activators and inhibitors are routinely used to demonstrate the requirement for PKC, few studies have shown that PKC is directly involved in intracellular transport. To address this issue, we have introduced a synthetic peptide specific to the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate domain into an in vitro transport assay (18Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This peptide interferes with PKCι/λ activity without modulating the kinase activity of other PKC isoenzymes (26House C. Kemp B. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 27Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Tissue culture cells were first infected with ts045 VSV, a virus that encodes for a glycoprotein (G protein) with a thermoreversible defect that results in ER retention at 39.5 °C (28Gallione C. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 374-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma membrane of these cells was perforated to release soluble content and then incubated at 32 °C in the presence of cytosol and ATP to initiate export of ts045 VSV-G from the ER. This semi-intact cell assay measures transport of ts045 VSV-G protein by following the processing of the two N-linked oligosaccharides to endo H-resistant forms indicative of transport to the cis-medial Golgi stacks. Fig. 1 shows that ts045 VSV-G transport from the ER to the Golgi complex was blocked in cells treated with increasing concentrations of the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide. Transport was reduced by 50% at a pseudosubstrate peptide concentration of 25 μm, whereas a randomized peptide had no effect on transport. These results indicate that PKCι/λ kinase activity is essential for ER to Golgi transport. We then determined the kinetics of inhibition of the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide relative to the transport block imposed by the addition of Rab2 (13-mer). This peptide made to the Rab2 amino terminus arrests VSV-G transport from the VTC (20Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ts045 VSV-G-infected NRK cells were incubated at 32 °C and at the indicated time (Δt), transferred to ice (control) or supplemented with 50 μm PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide or with 75 μm Rab2 (13-mer), and then incubated for a total of 60 min. This protocol allows any VSV-G that has migrated past the Rab2 or PKCι/λ-requiring step to continue migration to the cis-Golgi compartment. Therefore, the fraction of VSV-G processed to endo H resistance will depend on the amount of the reporter molecule that has transported beyond the Rab2 and the PKCι/λ-sensitive step at the time of their addition. In control cells, VSV-G endo H-resistant forms were detected after a 15-min lag (Fig. 1B). Within ∼20 min of incubation, 50% of the VSV-G protein was processed, indicating migration to the Golgi complex. In contrast, cells treated with the pseudosubstrate peptide were blocked in transport ∼5 min before the processing of VSV-G to endo H-resistant forms, and by 20 min of incubation, 65% VSV-G had transported through the pseudosubstrate-sensitive step. This temporal site of inhibition by PKCι/λ peptide occurs immediately following the block that occurs in the presence of Rab2 (13-mer). In both cases, the block in transport by pseudosubstrate peptide and Rab2 preceded the processing of VSV-G to endo H-sensitive forms by 5–10 min. This result indicates that PKCι/λ acts downstream of Rab2 but is required prior to cargo delivery to the Golgi complex. NRK Cells Treated with Pseudosubstrate Peptide Accumulate Swollen Vesicles—To define the morphological site of ts045 VSV-G accumulation in response to the pseudosubstrate peptide, NRK cells were infected with the virus for 3 h at the nonpermissive temperature to restrict VSV-G to the ER. The cells were then permeabilized and incubated in the absence or presence of Rab2 and PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide for 40 min at 32 °C, and the distribution of VSV-G was examined by confocal microscopy. Controls cells efficiently transported the reporter molecule to the Golgi complex (Fig. 2a) as did cells treated with the scrambled peptide (Fig. 2b). Consistent with the biochemical data, cells incubated with the pseudosubstrate peptide failed to transport VSV-G to the Golgi complex. Instead, VSV-G accumulated in a collar-like structure composed of small vesicular elements that ringed the nucleus (Fig. 2c). This staining pattern is similar to that observed when cells are incubated with constitutively activated Rab2 (Q65L) and with our affinity-purified anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody (25Tisdale E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When these pseudosubstrate peptide-treated cells were costained with an anti-p53/p58 polyclonal antibody, a nominal degree of co-localization was observed, indicating that VSV-G did not transport to the VTC (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, p53/58 was found on swollen vesicles that were largely absent from the cell periphery but concentrated near and surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 2f). These swollen vesicles displayed a considerable degree of co-localization with anti-PKCι/λ antibody and antibodies to Rab2 (Fig. 2e), p53/p58 (Fig. 2f), and β-COP (Fig. 2g). The presence of three VTC marker proteins suggests that the structures are derived from pre-Golgi intermediates (29Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Saraste J. Svensson K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 415-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From our earlier studies, we reported that PKCι/λ interacted directly with GAPDH. For this reason, the peptide-treated cells were also stained with antibodies specific to GAPDH to determine whether the pseudosubstrate peptide affected its distribution. Unlike PKCι/λ that is found on the dilated vesicles, a weak co-localization signal was observed for GAPDH (Fig. 2h). Importantly, we found no change in Golgi structure after incubation with the pseudosubstrate peptide (Fig. 2i) nor did we find that the swollen vesicles stained with a monoclonal antibody to protein-disulfide isomerase, a marker of the ER (Fig. 2i, inset). To learn whether there was enhanced recruitment of those proteins detected on the swollen vesicles in response to treatment with Rab2 and PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide, a quantitative binding assay was employed (5Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For this assay, microsomes were prepared from NRK cell homogenates and washed with 1 m KCL to remove peripherally associated proteins. These membranes were preincubated with buffer for 15 min on ice in the absence or presence of 50 ng of Rab2 and with increasing concentrations of the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide. The reaction was then supplemented with rat liver cytosol and GTPγS and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to promote binding of soluble components. To stop the reaction, membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and the pellet was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. A marked increase in membrane-associated PKCι/λ was observed after incubation with Rab2 and dependent on the pseudosubstrate peptide concentration (Fig. 3A). As predicted, there was a dose-dependent increase in membrane-associated β-COP (Fig. 3B), whereas the amount of GAPDH bound to membranes decreased with increasing concentrations of the peptide (Fig. 3C). This result is consistent with our previous findings in which the pseudosubstrate peptide blocked Rab2-stimulated GAPDH recruitment to membrane by interfering with PKCι/λ-GAPDH interaction (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found a concomitant decrease in the amount of phospho-GAPDH bound to the membranes indicating that the pseudosubstrate peptide was inhibiting the kinase activity of the recruited PKCι/λ (Fig. 3D). The enhanced recruitment of PKCι/λ and β-COP was specific to the PKCι/λ peptide. We did not observe any change in the level of these proteins when the assay was supplied with the scrambled peptide or with pseudosubstrate peptides made to PKCα or to PKCγ. These two isoforms were studied because both were found on NRK microsomes used in the binding assay (5Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A time course was performed to determine the rate of PKCι/λ binding to membranes treated with the pseudosubstrate peptide and Rab2. We knew from our earlier studies that Rab2 stimulated rapid translocation of PKCι/λ to membranes within minutes of addition. Longer incubation times lead to a progressive loss of PKCι/λ from the membrane due to the release of Rab2-generated vesicles containing PKCι/λ (5Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, PKCι/λ was recruited to membranes by Rab2 and pseudosubstrate peptide at a rate comparable to membranes treated only with Rab2. However, unlike microsomes incubated only with Rab2, there was no loss of PKCι/λ from the membranes with increasing times of incubation. A similar result was obtained when the assay was performed with kinase-dead PKCι/λ and Rab2. These results indicate that VTC-derived retrograde-vesicle release was inhibited and are consistent with our previous finding that PKCι/λ kinase activity is essential for Rab2-mediated vesicle formation. Kinase-Dead PKCι/λ Interferes with ER to Golgi Transport—To further demonstrate that PKCι/λ was required for transport in the early secretory pathway, we introduced purified wild type His6-PKCι/λ and kinase-dead His6-PKCι/λ (K275W) into the in vitro transport assay. Kinase-dead PKCι/λ inhibited the processing of VSV-G to endo H-resistant forms in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Transport was reduced by 50% at a mutant protein concentration of 75 ng. This reduction is significant because the mutant protein must compete with endogenous PKCι/λ wild type for limited binding sites on VTCs. Importantly, PKCι/λ wild type reversed the block in transport by the mutant protein (Fig. 5A). Kinase-dead PKCι/λ was then introduced into the morphological assay to determine whether the mutant protein caused a phenotype similar to cells treated with the pseudosubstrate peptide. NRK cells were first permeabilized and then incubated in the absence or presence of Rab2 and His6-PKCι/λ wild type or His6-PKCι/λ (K275W) for 45 min at 32 °C. In cells incubated with His6-PKCι/λ, anti-His6 monoclonal antibody labeled tubular-like beaded structures largely concentrated around the nucleus and near the Golgi complex (Fig. 5B). These cells did not appear to contain the swollen vesicles that were present in pseudosubstrate peptide-treated cells. However, permeabilized cells incubated with kinase-dead His6-PKCι/λ displayed enlarged vesicles co-stained with anti-His6 monoclonal antibody and anti-p53/p58 that were juxtanuclear in location and similar in size but less abundant compared with cells incubated with the pseudosubstrate peptide (Fig. 5B). This phenotype was lost when cells were co-incubated with PKCι/λ wild type and kinase-dead protein (Fig. 5B). In this case, PKCι/λ distribution was identical to cells treated with the wild type kinase. These combined results are highly suggestive that inactive PKCι/λ is a contributing factor to the formation and accumulation of swollen vesicles that most likely correspond to a VTC subcompartment. The PKC enzyme family contains in the C1 domain an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence that maintains the enzyme in the inactive form. This allows the substrate to be phosphorylated by the kinase after translocation to a specific intracellular membrane where the pseudosubstrate is removed by lipid activators (11Dutil E. Newton A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A similar effect occurs in the presence of exogenous pseudosubstrate sequences. Unlike PKC inhibitors that are generally nonspecific, pseudosubstrate peptides are the most selective tools to interfere with kinase activity. These peptides permit modulation of cell activities through direct interaction with a PKC isoform. We found that the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide was a potent inhibitor of VSV-G transport from the ER to the Golgi complex, whereas the addition of a randomized peptide had no effect. The arrest in VSV-G transport also occurred when the assay was supplemented with kinase-dead PKCι/λ. The pseudosubstrate peptide and kinase-dead PKCι/λ have previously been shown to efficiently block PKCι/λ phosphorylation of GAPDH in an in vitro kinase assay and inhibit Rab2-mediated vesicle release from NRK microsomes (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition by the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide is specific and like PKCι/λ (K274W) is because of the absence of PKCι/λ phosphorylation activity that is required for transport in the early secretory pathway. Moreover, our results indicate that PKCι/λ kinase activity is required for reverse translocation. NRK microsomes treated with Rab2 and pseudosubstrate peptide or kinase-dead PKCι/λ showed both enhanced recruitment and sustained PKCι/λ membrane association. Similar results have been reported for PKCβII in which the kinase-inactive enzyme exhibits reduced dissociation from membranes (16Feng X. Becker K. Stribling S. Peters K. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Parekh D. Ziegler W. Parker P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Importantly, VSV-G transport inhibition mediated by kinase-dead PKCι/λ was reversed by PKCι/λ wild type. A dramatic change in cell morphology was observed in PKCι/λ peptide and kinase-dead incubated cells. These cells displayed swollen vesicles that labeled with antibodies to PKCι/λ, β-COP, Rab2, and p53/p58. This phenotype was in direct contrast to cells incubated with recombinant PKCι/λ wild type, which contained anti-His6-labeled tubular-like elements in proximity to the Golgi complex. In some cases, the entities had a beaded-like appearance and may define domains actively involved in protein sorting and in the initial stage of vesicle budding (33Horstmann H. Ng C.P. Tang B. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4263-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Importantly, PKCι/λ wild type prevented the formation of swollen vesicles by kinase-dead PKCι/λ. This observation further indicates that the swollen structures are the product of dysfunctional PKCι/λ. Because p53/p58, β-COP, and Rab2 are marker proteins for pre-Golgi intermediates, the swollen entities are most probably derived from VTCs. VTCs are composed of small vesicles and tubules and represent transport intermediates between the ER and the Golgi complex (34Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These structures are the first site of segregation of the anterograde and retrograde pathways and thereby sort and recycle resident proteins from itinerate proteins destined for secretion. This sorting process results in domains highly enriched in retrograde-directed cargo and domains enriched in secretory cargo (35Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Geuze H. Slot J. Klumperman J. Cell. 1999; 98: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For this reason, a negligible amount of VSV-G, which traffics in the anterograde pathway, was detected in the swollen vesicles. The time of addition experiments performed in this study indicate that the pseudosubstrate peptide blocks VSV-G transport after the site of Rab2 (13-mer) action and before cargo transit to the Golgi complex. Therefore, it is possible that the swollen vesicles observed in kinase-dead and pseudosubstrate peptide-treated cells result from inhibition of retrograde-vesicle release from a VTC subcompartment enriched in recycling proteins, an event that requires PKCι/λ kinase activity. Interestingly, many of the Rab2-PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide-induced swollen structures contain a membrane “patch” where Rab2 and Rab2 effectors co-localized (Fig. 2e, inset). Since anterograde and retrograde transport are coupled, the inability to retrieve essential trafficking components from the VTC to the ER caused the arrest in VSV-G transport. Since GAPDH is a substrate for PKCι/λ and is required for ER to Golgi transport, it was conceivable that phospho-GAPDH was the essential phosphoprotein required for vesicle release from the VTC. However, our affinity-purified anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody, which efficiently blocks ER to Golgi transport, does not affect Rab2-stimulated vesicle formation. Although GAPDH is required for transport in the early secretory pathway, membrane-associated GAPDH is not essential for vesicle formation, indicating that GAPDH is not a critical component of the budding machinery. Instead, we believe that phospho-GAPDH is part of a protein complex that assembles on a VTC subcompartment in response to Rab2. This complex would serve as an export site to coordinate events required for retrograde-vesicle budding and microtubule nucleation. The observation that phospho-GAPDH is not required for vesicle release presents the possibility that there is an additional PKCι/λ substrate(s) located on the VTC that is not detected because phosphorylation results in membrane dissociation. This interpretation would be consistent with the observation that numerous transport-related proteins undergo cycles of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, which influences the protein cellular location and modulates their activity (36Slepnev V.

From these combined results, we propose that Rab2 binding to the VTC subdomain initiates a cascade of events that results in the recruitment of PKCι/λ, GAPDH, and other unidentified effectors from the cytosol. Rab2 in complex with its effectors defines the site of retrograde-vesicle budding from VTCs. PKCι/λ activation is a critical event that results in the phosphorylation of GAPDH and signals the downstream recruitment of COPI, which ultimately leads to the release of vesicles enriched in recycling components. Because VTCs are the secretory pathways counterpart to endosomes, the suggestion that Rab2 binds to and promotes membrane recycling from a VTC subcompartment is consistent with the finding that Rab5, Rab4, and Rab11 associate with endosome microdomains and regulate sequential transport events (39De Renzis S.
