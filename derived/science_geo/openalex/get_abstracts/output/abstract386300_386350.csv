Moreover, safe and effective means of directing the fate of patient-specific iPSCs toward clinically useful cell types are lacking. Here we describe a simple, nonintegrating strategy for reprogramming cell fate based on administration of synthetic mRNA modified to overcome innate antiviral responses. We show that this approach can reprogram multiple human cell types to pluripotency with efficiencies that greatly surpass established protocols. We further show that the same technology can be used to efficiently direct the differentiation of RNA-induced pluripotent stem cells (RiPSCs) into terminally differentiated myogenic cells. This technology represents a safe, efficient strategy for somatic cell reprogramming and directing cell fate that has broad applicability for basic research, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine.

Modified mRNAs can express reprogramming proteins and evade antiviral response Highly efficient derivation of human iPSCs without genomic integration RNA-derived iPSCs faithfully recapitulate the properties of human ESCs Efficient directed differentiation of iPSCs to differentiated myotubes The reprogramming of differentiated cells to pluripotency holds great promise as a tool for studying normal development, while offering hope that patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could be used to model disease or to generate clinically useful cell types for autologous therapies aimed at repairing deficits arising from injury, illness, and aging. Induction of pluripotency was originally achieved by Yamanaka and colleagues by enforced expression of four transcription factors, KLF4, c-MYC, OCT4, and SOX2 (KMOS), by using retroviral vectors (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

Viral integration into the genome initially presented a formidable obstacle to therapeutic use of iPSCs. The search for ways to induce pluripotency without incurring genetic change has thus become the focus of intense research effort. Toward this end, iPSCs have been derived via excisable lentiviral and transposon vectors or through repeated application of transient plasmid, episomal, and adenovirus vectors (Chang et al., 2009Chang C.-W.

Ban H. Nishiyama A. Saeki K. Hasegawa M. Efficient induction of transgene-free human pluripotent stem cells using a vector based on Sendai virus, an RNA virus that does not integrate into the host genome.Proc. Jpn. Acad., Ser. B, Phys. Biol. Sci. 2009; 85: 348-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Despite such progress, considerable limitations accompany the nonintegrative iPSC derivation strategies devised thus far. For example, although DNA transfection-based methodologies are ostensibly safe, they nonetheless entail some risk of genomic recombination or insertional mutagenesis. In protein-based strategies, the recombinant proteins used are challenging to generate and purify in the quantities required (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou H. Wu S. Joo J.Y. Zhu S. Han D.W. Lin T. Trauger S. Bien G. Yao S. Zhu Y. et al.Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells using recombinant proteins.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Use of Sendai virus requires stringent steps to purge reprogrammed cells of replicating virus, and the sensitivity of the viral RNA replicase to transgene sequence content may limit the generality of this reprogramming vehicle (Fusaki et al., 2009Fusaki N. Ban H. Nishiyama A. Saeki K. Hasegawa M.

Biol. Sci. 2009; 85: 348-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Importantly, methods that rely on repeat administration of transient vectors, whether DNA or protein based, have so far shown very low iPSC derivation efficiencies (Jia et al., 2010Jia F. Wilson K.D.

Here we demonstrate that repeated administration of synthetic messenger RNAs incorporating modifications designed to bypass innate antiviral responses can reprogram differentiated human cells to pluripotency with conversion efficiencies and kinetics substantially superior to established viral protocols. Furthermore, this simple, nonmutagenic, and highly controllable technology is applicable to a range of tissue-engineering tasks, exemplified here by RNA-mediated directed differentiation of RNA-iPSCs (RiPSCs) to terminally differentiated myogenic cells. We manufactured mRNA by using in vitro transcription (IVT) reactions templated by PCR amplicons (Figure S1 available online). To promote efficient translation and boost RNA half-life in the cytoplasm, a 5′ guanine cap was incorporated by inclusion of a synthetic cap analog in the IVT reactions (Yisraeli and Melton, 1989Yisraeli J.K. Melton D.A. Synthesis of long, capped transcripts in vitro by SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases.Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Within our IVT templates, the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene of interest is flanked by a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) containing a strong Kozak translational initiation signal and an alpha-globin 3′ UTR terminating with an oligo(dT) sequence for templated addition of a polyA tail. Cytosolic delivery of mRNA into mammalian cells can be achieved via electroporation or by complexing the RNA with a cationic vehicle to facilitate uptake by endocytosis (Audouy and Hoekstra, 2001Audouy S.

We focused on the latter approach, reasoning that this would allow for repeated transfection to sustain ectopic protein expression over the days to weeks required for cellular reprogramming. In preliminary experiments in which synthetic RNA encoding GFP was transfected into murine embryonic fibroblasts and human epidermal keratinocytes, a high, dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed that was not attributable to the cationic vehicle, which was exacerbated on repeated transfection. These experiments revealed a serious impediment to achieving sustained protein expression by mRNA transfection and highlighted a need to develop a technology that would permit sustained protein expression with mRNA with reduced cellular toxicity. It is known that exogenous single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) activates antiviral defenses in mammalian cells through interferon- and NF-κB-dependent pathways (Diebold et al., 2004Diebold S.S. Kaisho T.

We sought approaches to reduce the immunogenic profile of synthetic RNA in order to increase the sustainability of RNA-mediated protein expression. Cotranscriptional capping yields a significant fraction of uncapped IVT products bearing 5′ triphosphates, which can be detected by the ssRNA sensor RIG-I (Hornung et al., 2006Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzózka K. Jung A. Kato H. Poeck H. Akira S. Conzelmann K.-K. Schlee M. et al.5′-Triphosphate RNA is the ligand for RIG-I.Science. 2006; 314: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, Pichlmair et al., 2006Pichlmair A. Schulz O. Tan C.P. Näslund T.I.

Bevilacqua P.C. Nucleoside modifications modulate activation of the protein kinase PKR in an RNA structure-specific manner.RNA. 2008; 14: 1201-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore treated synthesized RNA with a phosphatase, which resulted in modest reductions in cytotoxicity upon transfection (data not shown). Eukaryotic mRNA is extensively modified in vivo, and the presence of modified nucleobases has been shown to reduce signaling by RIG-I and PKR, as well as by the less widely expressed but inducible endosomal ssRNA sensors TLR7 and TLR8 (Karikó et al., 2005Karikó K.

Gehrke L. Nucleotide sequences and modifications that determine RIG-I/RNA binding and signaling activities.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 4174-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In an attempt to further reduce innate immune responses to transfected RNA, we synthesized mRNAs incorporating modified ribonucleoside bases. Complete substitution of either 5-methylcytidine (5mC) for cytidine or pseudouridine (psi) for uridine in GFP-encoding transcripts markedly improved viability and increased ectopic protein expression, although the most significant improvement was seen when both modifications were used together (Figures 1A–1C ). These modifications dramatically attenuated interferon signaling as revealed by qRT-PCR for a panel of interferon response genes, although residual upregulation of some interferon targets was still detected (Figure 1D). It is known that cellular antiviral defenses can self-prime through a positive-feedback loop involving autocrine and paracrine signaling by type I interferons (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008Randall R.E. Goodbourn S. Interferons and viruses: An interplay between induction, signalling, antiviral responses and virus countermeasures.J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Media supplementation with a recombinant version of B18R protein, a Vaccinia virus decoy receptor for type I interferons (Symons et al., 1995Symons J.A. Alcamí A. Smith G.L. Vaccinia virus encodes a soluble type I interferon receptor of novel structure and broad species specificity.Cell. 1995; 81: 551-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), further increased cell viability of RNA transfection in some cell types (data not shown). Synthesis of RNA with modified ribonucleotides and phosphatase treatment (henceforth, modified RNAs), used in conjunction with media supplementation with the interferon inhibitor B18R, allowed for high, dose-dependent levels of protein expression with high cell viability (Figure 1E). Transfection of modified RNA encoding GFP into six human cell types showed highly penetrant expression (50%–90% positive cells), demonstrating the applicability of this technology to diverse cell types (Figure S2A). Simultaneous delivery of modified RNAs encoding mCherry and GFP containing a nuclear localization signal confirmed that generalized coexpression of multiple proteins could be achieved in mammalian cells and that expressed proteins could be correctly localized to different cellular compartments (Figure 1F). Ectopic protein expression after RNA transfection is transient owing to RNA and protein degradation and the diluting effect of cell division. To establish the kinetics and persistence of protein expression, modified RNA encoding GFP variants designed for high and low protein stability (Li et al., 1998Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.-C. Kain S.R. Generation of destabilized green fluorescent protein as a transcription reporter.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34970-34975Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) were synthesized and transfected into keratinocytes. Time course analysis by flow cytometry showed that protein expression persisted for several days for the high-stability variant but peaked within 12 hr and decayed rapidly thereafter for the destabilized GFP (Figure S2B). These results indicated that a repetitive transfection regimen would be required to sustain high levels of ectopic expression for short-lived proteins over an extended time course. To address this and further examine the impact of repeated RNA transfection on cell growth and viability, we transfected BJ fibroblasts for 10 consecutive days with either unmodified or modified RNAs encoding a destabilized nuclear GFP and appropriate controls (Figure S3A). Daily transfection with modified RNA permitted sustained protein expression without substantially compromising the viability of the culture beyond a modest reduction in growth kinetics that was largely attributable to the transfection reagent (Figures 1G and 1H; Figure S2C). Microarray analysis of the cultures after the tenth and final transfection revealed that prolonged daily transfection with modified RNA did not significantly alter the molecular profile of the transfected cells (Figure S2D), although upregulation of a number of interferon response genes was noted, consistent with our previous observation that the RNA modifications did not completely abrogate interferon signaling (Figure 1D; Figure S2E). By contrast, repeated transfection with unmodified RNA severely compromised the growth and viability of the culture through elicitation of a massive interferon response (Figure 1D), indicating that the use of unmodified RNA was not a viable strategy for sustaining polypeptide expression in cells (Figure 1G). To determine whether modified RNAs could be used to directly alter cell fate, we synthesized modified RNA encoding the myogenic transcription factor MYOD (Davis et al., 1987Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Expression of a single transfected cDNA converts fibroblasts to myoblasts.Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar) and transfected it into murine C3H10T1/2 cells over the course of 3 days, followed by continued culturing in a low serum media for an additional 3 days. The emergence of large, multinucleated myotubes that stained positive for the myogenic markers myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) provided proof of principle that transfection with modified RNAs could be utilized to efficiently direct cell fate (Figure 1I). We next sought to determine whether induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could be derived via modified RNAs. To this end, modified RNAs encoding the four canonical Yamanaka factors, KLF4 (K), c-MYC (M), OCT4 (O), and SOX2 (S), were synthesized and transfected into cells. Immunostaining with antibodies directed against OCT4, KLF4, and SOX2 demonstrated that each of the factors was robustly expressed and correctly localized to the nucleus (Figure 2A ). Expression kinetics was monitored by flow cytometry, which showed maximal protein expression 12 to 18 hours after transfection, followed by rapid turnover of these transcription factors (Figure 2B). From this we concluded that daily transfections would be required to maintain high levels of expression of the Yamanaka factors during long-term, multifactor reprogramming regimens. We next sought to establish a protocol to ensure sustained, high-level protein expression through daily transfection of modified RNAs by exploring a matrix of conditions encompassing different transfection reagents, culture media, feeder cell types, and RNA doses (data not shown). Once optimized, we initiated long-term reprogramming experiments with human ESC-derived dH1f fibroblasts, which display relatively efficient viral-mediated iPSC conversion (Chan et al., 2009Chan E.M.

Reprogramming of human somatic cells to pluripotency with defined factors.Nature. 2008; 451: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Low-oxygen (5% O2) culture conditions and a KMOS stoichiometry of 1:1:3:1 were employed, because these have been reported to promote efficient iPSC conversion (Kawamura et al., 2009Kawamura T.

Modified RNA encoding a destabilized nuclear GFP was spiked into the KMOS RNA cocktail to allow visualization of continued protein expression throughout the experimental time course (Figure S3A). Widespread transformation of fibroblast morphology to a compact, epithelioid morphology was observed within the first week of modified RNA transfection, followed by emergence of canonical hESC-like colonies with tight morphology, well-defined borders, and prominent nucleoli toward the end of the second week of transfection (Figure 2C). RNA transfection was terminated on day 17, and colonies were mechanically picked 3 days later, which were then expanded under standard ESC culture conditions to establish 14 prospective iPSC lines, designated dH1f-RiPSC (RNA-derived iPSC) 1–14. We next attempted to reprogram somatically derived cells to pluripotency by using a similar reprogramming regimen. Anticipating that these cells might be more challenging to reprogram, we employed a five-factor cocktail including a modified RNA encoding LIN28 (KMOSL), which has been shown to facilitate reprogramming (Yu et al., 2007Yu J.

Direct cell reprogramming is a stochastic process amenable to acceleration.Nature. 2009; 462: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), and we supplemented the media with valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been reported to increase reprogramming efficiency (Huangfu et al., 2008Huangfu D. Maehr R. Guo W. Eijkelenboom A. Snitow M. Chen A.E. Melton D.A. Induction of pluripotent stem cells by defined factors is greatly improved by small-molecule compounds.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Four human cell types were tested: Detroit 551 (D551) and MRC-5 fetal fibroblasts, BJ postnatal fibroblasts, and fibroblast-like cells cultured from a primary skin biopsy taken from an adult cystic fibrosis patient (CF cells). Daily transfection with the modified RNA KMOSL cocktail gave rise to numerous hESC-like colonies in the D551, BJ, CF, and MRC5 cultures that were mechanically picked at day 18, 20, 21, and 25, respectively. More than 10 RiPSC clones were expanded for each of the somatic lines, with notably very few clones failing to establish. Immunostaining confirmed the expression of OCT4, NANOG, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA3, and SSEA4 in all the RiPSC lines examined (Figure 2D; Figure S3B). DNA fingerprinting confirmed parental origin of three RiPSC clones from each somatic cell derivation, and all clones presented normal karyotypes (data not shown). Of note, additional experiments conducted in the presence or absence of VPA showed little difference in reprogramming efficiency (data not shown), and VPA was therefore not used in subsequent experiments. A number of molecular and functional assays were performed to further assess whether the RiPSCs had been reprogrammed to pluripotency (Table S1). Multiple RiPSC lines derived from each of the five starting cell types were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and all demonstrated robust expression of the pluripotency-associated transcripts OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and hTERT (Figure 3A ).

An Intestinal crypt contains 14 equal Lgr5hi stem cells that all divide each day A multicolor Cre-reporter mouse was developed for lineage tracing of stem cells Most Lgr5hi stem cell divisions yield a symmetric cell fate outcome Homeostasis results from competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5hi stem cells Although invertebrate stem cells and their niches can be studied with single-cell resolution, the size of mammalian tissues combined with the infrequent occurrence of stem cells have complicated the identification of individual stem cells in vivo (Morrison and Spradling, 2008Morrison S.J. Spradling A.C. Stem cells and niches: mechanisms that promote stem cell maintenance throughout life.Cell. 2008; 132: 598-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The small intestinal epithelium presents a unique opportunity to study mammalian adult stem cells. Not only is it the fastest self-renewing tissue in mammals, it also has a simple, highly stereotypical layout. It is essentially a two-dimensional (2D) structure: a sheet of cells, bent in space to form the crypts and villi. Cell compartments are easily identified by location along the crypt-villus axis. And, importantly, all cellular progeny remain associated with the stem cell compartment of origin. Stem cells reside at the crypt base and feed daughter cells into the TA compartment. TA cells undergo approximately 4–5 rounds of rapid cell division (Marshman et al., 2002Marshman E. Booth C. Potten C.S. The intestinal epithelial stem cell.Bioessays. 2002; 24: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). TA cells move out of the crypt and terminally differentiate into enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells. These differentiated cells continue to move up the villus flanks to die upon reaching the villus tip after 2–3 more days. A fourth cell type, the Paneth cell, also derives from the stem cells but migrates downwards and settles at the crypt base to live for 6–8 weeks (van der Flier and Clevers, 2009van der Flier L.G. Clevers H. Stem cells, self-renewal, and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that small cycling cells located between the Paneth cells, previously identified as crypt base columnar cells (Cheng and Leblond, 1974aCheng H. Leblond C.P.

Using lineage tracing, we demonstrated that these Lgr5hi cells generate all cell types of the small intestinal epithelium throughout life. Similar data were obtained using a CD133-based lineage tracing strategy (Zhu et al., 2009Zhu L. Gibson P. Currle D.S. Tong Y. Richardson R.J. Bayazitov I.T. Poppleton H. Zakharenko S. Ellison D.W.

The Ascl2 transcription factor sets the fate of the Lgr5hi cells (van der Flier et al., 2009van der Flier L.G. van Gijn M.E. Hatzis P. Kujala P. Haegebarth A. Stange D.E. Begthel H. van den Born M.

As further proof of stemness, single Lgr5hi cells can generate ever-expanding epithelial organoids with all hallmarks of in vivo epithelial tissue (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G.

In the colon, stomach, and hair follicle, Lgr5hi cells have also been identified as stem cells (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M.

Previously it was postulated that a cycling, yet DNA label-retaining cell at position +4 represents a stem cell (Potten et al., 1974Potten C.S. Kovacs L. Hamilton E. Continuous labelling studies on mouse skin and intestine.Cell Tissue Kinet. 1974; 7: 271-283PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple markers were published for this cell (He et al., 2004He X.C. Zhang J.

Identification of a putative intestinal stem cell and early lineage marker; musashi-1.Differentiation. 2003; 71: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Using one of these markers, Bmi1, long-term lineage tracing was observed with kinetics that are surprisingly similar to that of Lgr5hi cells (Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008Sangiorgi E. Capecchi M.R. Bmi1 is expressed in vivo in intestinal stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). As sorted Lgr5hi cells express the highest levels of Bmi1 as assessed by qPCR analysis (Snippert et al., 2009Snippert H.J. van Es J.H. van den Born M. Begthel H. Stange D.E. Barker N. Clevers H.

Although a rare, quiescent “reserve” Lgr5neg population may exist (Li and Clevers, 2010Li L. Clevers H. Coexistence of quiescent and active adult stem cells in mammals.Science. 2010; 327: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), the Lgr5hi cells represent the workhorse of life-long self-renewal of the healthy small intestine. The most popular view on how stem cell populations accomplish homeostasis involves asymmetric cell division, which—at the single stem cell level—results in two cells with unequal fates: one new stem cell and one TA cell. This pattern of “invariant asymmetry” in cell division can be controlled by cell-intrinsic mechanisms best exemplified by the first division of the C. elegans embryo (Cowan and Hyman, 2004Cowan C.R. Hyman A.A. Asymmetric cell division in C. elegans: cortical polarity and spindle positioning.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 427-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) but also by extrinsic niche signals as shown for Drosophila germ stem cells (Fuller and Spradling, 2007Fuller M.T. Spradling A.C. Male and female Drosophila germline stem cells: two versions of immortality.Science. 2007; 316: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The asymmetric segregation of molecules coupled with strictly oriented mitotic spindles can herald an asymmetric fate outcome of the stem cell division, as shown for the C. elegans embryo and the Drosophila neuroblast (Neumuller and Knoblich, 2009Neumuller R.A. Knoblich J.A. Dividing cellular asymmetry: asymmetric cell division and its implications for stem cells and cancer.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2675-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Only upon tissue expansion or damage will stem cells divide symmetrically in this model. We refer to mechanisms of stem cell maintenance that rely upon invariant asymmetry of division as belonging to the class of hierarchical models. Another, less commonly considered model for homeostatic stem cell maintenance states that the two cells that are generated from a stem cell division do not necessarily display intrinsically divergent fates. Such a stem cell division can lead to any of three fate outcomes: two stem cells, one stem cell and one TA cell, or two TA cells. In order to maintain stem cell number in this model, homeostatic mechanisms have to act by necessity at the stem cell population level, ensuring that—on average—each stem cell division results in one stem cell and one TA cell. Stem cell-supported tissues that exhibit this pattern of regulatory control belong to the class of stochastic models. In contrast to hierarchical models, the clonal fate of individual stem cells in stochastic models is unpredictable. Unlike most other mammalian tissues, the stem cells of the intestine are strictly compartmentalized in crypts. Winton and Ponder reported that the marking of individual stem cells results in entirely clonal crypts after 3 months and concluded that a single stem cell maintains each crypt (Winton and Ponder, 1990Winton D.J. Ponder B.A. Stem-cell organization in mouse small intestine.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Griffith et al. draw comparable conclusions for colonic crypts (Griffiths et al., 1988Griffiths D.F. Davies S.J. Williams D. Williams G.T. Williams E.D. Demonstration of somatic mutation and colonic crypt clonality by X-linked enzyme histochemistry.Nature. 1988; 333: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this view, crypt stem cell dynamics would represent an extreme version of the hierarchical model. Potten and Loeffler on the other hand proposed that crypts may harbor multiple stem cells that are not strictly dividing asymmetrically (Potten and Loeffler, 1990Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Stem cells: attributes, cycles, spirals, pitfalls and uncertainties. Lessons for and from the crypt.Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lgr5hi stem cells in the small intestine divide approximately once per day (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. et al.Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3489) Google Scholar). Quyn and colleagues have demonstrated that each Lgr5hi stem cell orients its mitotic spindle along its apical-basal axis (Quyn et al., 2010Quyn A.J. Appleton P.L. Carey F.A. Steele R.J. Barker N. Clevers H. Ridgway R.A. Sansom O.J. Nathke I.S.

In order to visualize crypt architecture at single-cell resolution, we generated an E-cadherin-mCFP fusion knock-in allele (Figures 1A and 1B and Figure S1 available online) and crossed this into the Lgr5-EGFP-Ires-CreERT2 KI mouse strain. E-cadherin-mCFP mice were homozygous viable. The E-cadherin fusion protein allowed visualization of 3D crypt architecture to depths of 125 μm (Figure 1C), which revealed an almost perfect intermingling of Lgr5hi cells and Paneth cells (Figure 1E).Figure S1E-cadherin-mCFP KI Fusion Protein Maintains Endogenous Expression Pattern and Cellular Localization, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) E-cadherin-mCFP KI strategy. mCFP was targeted at the endogenous STOP codon of Cdh1, thereby maintaining expression levels and pattern.(B) Southern blot of targeted ES cells confirms proper integration into Cdh1 locus.(C) Expression pattern and cellular localization of E-cadherin-mCFP recapitulated the endogenous situation.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis demonstrated the existence of three different Lgr5-expressing populations based on GFP level (Figure 1D), of which only the GFPhi cells yield long-lived intestinal organoid structures in vitro (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. et al.Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar). We next counted Lgr5hi intestinal stem cells in duodenal crypts of Lgr5-EGFP-Ires-CreERT2/E-cadherin-mCFP mice. In the 3D reconstruction model (Figure 1E), essentially all non-Paneth cells at the crypt base were Lgr5-GFPhi. Conversely, no Lgr5-GFPhi cells were observed outside the crypt base. Crypts of the duodenum were found to contain 14 ± 2 Lgr5hi cells (Figure 1F), similar to the numbers of crypt base columnar cells as originally reported (Cheng and Leblond, 1974bCheng H. Leblond C.P. Origin, differentiation and renewal of the four main epithelial cell types in the mouse small intestine. V. Unitarian Theory of the origin of the four epithelial cell types.Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). In our initial in vitro experiments, less than 5% of single sorted Lgr5 intestinal stem cells could grow out into gut-like organoid structures (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. et al.Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar). Recently, we noted that sorted heterotypic doublets (consisting of one Lgr5hi stem cell and one Paneth cell) displayed 25% plating efficiency (H.C. and T.S., unpublished data). After further optimization, we reached a plating efficiency of approximately 60% when scored as exponentially growing organoids after 7 days (Figure 2). In other words, more than half of Lgr5hi cells could grow out into an intestinal organoid when sorted together with a neighboring Paneth cell. We interpreted this to imply that the majority of Lgr5hi cells have stem cell properties, at least when associated with a Paneth cell. Thus, we tentatively viewed each duodenal crypt to harbor a homogeneous population of 14 Lgr5hi intestinal stem cells. To address how homeostatic self-renewal is controlled, we generated a Cre-reporter allele termed R26R-Confetti. We integrated into the Rosa26 locus a construct consisting of the strong CAGG promoter, a LoxP-flanked NeoR-cassette serving as transcriptional roadblock, and the original Brainbow-2.1 cassette (Livet et al., 2007Livet J. Weissman T.A. Kang H. Draft R.W. Lu J. Bennis R.A. Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Transgenic strategies for combinatorial expression of fluorescent proteins in the nervous system.Nature. 2007; 450: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A ). After Cre-mediated recombination, the roadblock was removed and one of the four fluorescent marker proteins was stochastically placed under control of the CAGG promoter, allowing discrimination between the clonal progeny of neighboring stem cells within the same niche (Figure 3B). We validated fluorescent expression in multiple organs using the β-naphtaflavone (bNF)-inducible Ah-Cre allele (Ireland et al., 2004Ireland H. Kemp R. Houghton C. Howard L. Clarke A.R. Sansom O.J. Winton D.J. Inducible Cre-mediated control of gene expression in the murine gastrointestinal tract: effect of loss of beta-catenin.Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1236-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cre induction in small intestinal crypts occurs at high efficiency, whereas less efficient induction of the Cre transgene occurs in a variety of other organs. The R26R-Confetti allele behaved as a stochastic multicolor Cre-reporter generating nuclear green, cytoplasmic yellow, cytoplasmic red, or membrane-bound blue cells (Figure 3C). Whereas the other three colors consistently appeared in near-equal ratios, nuclear GFP cells occurred at varying frequencies, yet always lower than the expected 25%. Crypts drift toward clonality over time (Griffiths et al., 1988Griffiths D.F. Davies S.J. Williams D. Williams G.T. Williams E.D. Demonstration of somatic mutation and colonic crypt clonality by X-linked enzyme histochemistry.Nature. 1988; 333: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Winton and Ponder, 1990Winton D.J. Ponder B.A. Stem-cell organization in mouse small intestine.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), yet the kinetics of this process have not been documented at the single stem cell level. In the first of two tracing strategies addressing this issue, we analyzed the behavior of clones developing from single Lgr5hi cells, stochastically initiated using the Lgr5-EGFP-Ires-CreERT2 allele in conjunction with the R26R-Confetti reporter. Analysis of stem cell clones was performed at various time points after Cre-activation by tamoxifen in 10-week-old mice, after which the progeny of these Lgr5hi cells were mapped in 3D-reconstructed crypts. Labeling occurred at a frequency of approximately one event per six crypts. All analyses were performed on crypts in the proximal segment of the duodenum. Clone size was determined as the number of cells marked by a single fluorescent protein upon recombination of the R26R-Confetti allele. Cytoplasmic GFP intensity derived from the Lgr5 knock-in allele allowed the identification of Lgr5hi cells within a clone. Invariably, the identification of Lgr5hi cells by cytoplasmic GFP was confirmed by their location between Paneth cells. The first Confetti-marked stem cells were observed 24 hr after Cre induction (Figure 4A ). Most clones consisted of a single cell, of which 90% (34/38) could be identified as an Lgr5hi cell located between Paneth cells (Figure 4B). Around 10% (5/43) of the marked stem cells had already undergone mitosis (Figure 4B). After 2 days, most cells had divided at least once (Figures 4C and 4D). We scored 101 two-cell clones for the presence of Lgr5 hi cells. Of these, 54 clones contained two Lgr5 hi cells, 10 contained a single Lgr5hi cell, and 37 contained no Lgr5hi cells (Figure 4D). Alongside the 101 two-cell clones, there were a further 37 larger clones with mixed Lgr5 expression, including one seven-cell clone containing no Lgr5hi cells, and others with four cells all of which were Lgr5hi. Apart from an overall expansion of clone size, this general pattern of behavior (broad size distribution and divergent fates) was maintained at day 3 with the largest clone having as many as 10 cells (Figures 4E and 4F). These results were indicative of the intestinal stem cells following seemingly divergent fates. At later time points (day 7 and day 14), the rapid expansion and transfer of cells through the TA cell compartment to the villus made it challenging to reliably score their number. Therefore, we scored the number of Lgr5hi cells in each clone at days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14, while disregarding all other cell types within the clone. Thus, a ten-cell clone comprised of four Lgr5hi cells and six Lgr5lo cells translates to a clone of size 4, while a ten-cell clone in which all cells are Lgr5lo was considered “extinct.” With this definition, the size distribution of surviving clones is shown over the 14 day chase period (Figure 4G). The data reveal a steady increase in the average clone size that compensates for the ongoing extinction of clones. Indeed, by day 14, the largest clone contained as many as 12 Lgr5hi cells, a figure approaching the 14 Lgr5hi cell average found in duodenal crypts. It was apparent that, even in the largest surviving clones, the labeled Lgr5hi cells were largely grouped together suggesting that, despite their rapid turnover, mixing of cells at the crypt base was limited (Figure S2, Movie S1, and Movie S2). Furthermore, the morphology of these clones in the Lgr5hi compartment was consistent with a lateral expansion around the circumference of the crypt base, whereas few, if any, cell divisions lead to clonal expansion through the base to the opposite side of the crypt. In the second strategy, we aimed to mark all stem cells in crypts to document the drift toward clonality. The Lgr5 gene is expressed at low levels and, as a consequence, the Lgr5-EGFP-Ires-CreERT2 allele does not generate quantitative Cre activation upon a single tamoxifen induction. We therefore used the R26R-Confetti allele in conjunction with the Ah-Cre allele. The Ah-Cre transgene recombines LoxP sites efficiently in most cell types including the stem cells yet is inactive in the long-lived Paneth cells (Ireland et al., 2004Ireland H. Kemp R. Houghton C. Howard L. Clarke A.R. Sansom O.J. Winton D.J. Inducible Cre-mediated control of gene expression in the murine gastrointestinal tract: effect of loss of beta-catenin.Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1236-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, within the Paneth cell compartment, old unmarked Paneth cells are replaced by marked precursor cells over time (Ireland et al., 2005Ireland H. Houghton C. Howard L. Winton D.J. Cellular inheritance of a Cre-activated reporter gene to determine Paneth cell longevity in the murine small intestine.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 1332-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Clonal analysis was performed at various time points after Cre activation in 10-week-old Ah-Cre/R26R-Confetti mice, using “side-view” and “bottom-view” imaging of whole-mount intestine (“xy plane” and “xz plane,” respectively; Figure 5A ). Thus, the composition of many crypts could be captured in a single confocal image taken just above the crypt base, and for each crypt displayed as the biological equivalent of a “pie-chart.” Analysis of the crypts in the time course provided visual snapshots of individual labeled domains of cells within crypts (Figure 5B). Using these “bottom-view” images, we were able to extract quantitative data from week 1 to week 30, documenting the drift toward clonality (Figure 5B). Although only a small fraction of cells acquired the nuclear GFP label, 80% of the remaining cells were induced in approximately equal proportions, yellow:blue:red. At the earliest time point taken at 4 days post-labeling, the confocal section at the crypt base showed a striking, heterogeneous pattern of labeling (Figure 5B). At day 7, there was a significant expansion and coarsening of the labeled domains reflecting stem cell loss and lateral expansion of neighboring clones (Figure 5B). At later time points, we observed a continuing expansion of the average domain size alongside an ever-diminishing number of domains until crypts became fully labeled with one color (monochromatic) or fully unlabeled (Figure 5B). The first monochromatic crypts appeared as early as 2 weeks post-induction, whereas around 75% had become fully labeled at 2 months (Figure 5B). Although the drift toward monoclonality continued, we noted the presence—albeit rare—of oligo-clonal crypts even at 18 and 30 weeks post-labeling (Figure 5B, circles). To describe quantitatively the drift toward clonality, we converted the sections from the crypt base into a labeled domain-size distribution (Figure 6A ). Specifically, we divided the circumference into 16 equal parts (“sextadecals”), reflecting the typical number of TA cells in a section near, but above, the crypt base (Potten and Loeffler, 1990Potten C.S.

This assignment related proportionately to the stem cell content of a clone. For example, if we found a labeled domain of size 4 sextadecals—i.e., covering one quarter of the crypt circumference—this translated to one quarter of the crypt base stem cells being labeled in that color. In this way, we could determine the labeled domain size distribution (Figure 6B) as well as the frequency of monochromatic crypts (Figure 6C) over the 30 week chase period. On day 7, the domain size distribution was tilted toward smaller clone sizes with a peak around 3 to 4 sextadecals, i.e., clones covering 3/16 to 4/16 of the circumference (Figure 6B). At 2 weeks, the weight of the distribution was gradually shifting toward larger clone sizes (Figure 6B), with a small fraction of crypts (ca. 5%) already fully labeled (Figure 6C). At 4 weeks, the average domain covered around 8 sextadecals, the half-filled crypt, in partially labeled crypts (Figure 6B), whereas about 45% had become monochromatic (Figure 6C). This trend continued out to the latest time point at 30 weeks when almost all crypts were monochromatic. This behavior was consistent with competition between neighboring stem cells leading to ever fewer yet larger clones and a steady progression toward monoclonality. This phenomenon was age independent, as we observed the same drift toward clonality, when lineage tracing was initiated in 40-week-old mic"

Long noncoding RNAs activate neighboring protein-coding genes Activating long ncRNAs behave similarly to classically defined enhancer elements Depletion of Snail1 or its adjacent ncRNA-7a show similar cellular migration defects Recent technological advances have allowed the analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes with an unprecedented resolution. These experiments indicate that a major portion of the genome is being transcribed and that protein-coding sequences only account for a minority of cellular transcriptional output (Bertone et al., 2004Bertone P.

MicroRNAs are endogenously expressed noncoding transcripts that silence gene expression by targeting specific mRNAs on the basis of sequence recognition (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Origins and Mechanisms of miRNAs and siRNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 642-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). Over 1000 microRNA loci are estimated to be functional in humans, modulating roughly 30% of protein-coding genes (Berezikov and Plasterk, 2005Berezikov E. Plasterk R.H. Camels and zebrafish, viruses and cancer: a microRNA update.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14 (Spec No. 2, R183-190)Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). While microRNAs represent a minority of the noncoding transcriptome, the tangle of long and short noncoding transcripts is much more intricate, and is likely to contain as yet unidentified classes of molecules forming transcriptional regulatory networks (Efroni et al., 2008Efroni S. Duttagupta R. Cheng J. Dehghani H. Hoeppner D.J. Dash C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Le Grice S. McKay R.D.

Hofacker I.L. et al.RNA maps reveal new RNA classes and a possible function for pervasive transcription.Science. 2007; 316: 1484-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Long ncRNAs are transcripts longer than 100 nts which in most cases mirror the features of protein-coding genes without containing a functional open reading frame (ORF). Long ncRNAs have been implicated as principal players in imprinting and X-inactivation. The imprinting phenomenon dictates the repression of a particular allele, depending on its paternal or maternal origin. Many clusters of imprinted genes contain ncRNAs, and some of them have been implicated in the transcriptional silencing (Yang and Kuroda, 2007Yang P.K. Kuroda M.I. Noncoding RNAs and intranuclear positioning in monoallelic gene expression.Cell. 2007; 128: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, the X chromosome inactivation relies on the expression of a long ncRNA named Xist, which is thought to recruit, in a cis-specific manner, protein complexes establishing repressive epigenetic marks that encompass the chromosome (Heard and Disteche, 2006Heard E. Disteche C.M. Dosage compensation in mammals: fine-tuning the expression of the X chromosome.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1848-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). There is also a report indicating that a long ncRNA expressed from the HOXC locus may affect the expression of genes in the HOXD locus which is located on a different chromosome (Rinn et al., 2007Rinn J.L. Kertesz M. Wang J.K. Squazzo S.L. Xu X. Brugmann S.A. Goodnough L.H. Helms J.A. Farnham P.J. Segal E. Chang H.Y. Functional demarcation of active and silent chromatin domains in human HOX loci by noncoding RNAs.Cell. 2007; 129: 1311-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3096) Google Scholar). More recently, a set of long ncRNAs has been identified in mouse, through the analysis of the chromatin signatures (Guttman et al., 2009Guttman M. Amit I. Garber M. French C. Lin M.F. Feldser D. Huarte M. Zuk O. Carey B.W. Cassady J.P. et al.Chromatin signature reveals over a thousand highly conserved large non-coding RNAs in mammals.Nature. 2009; 458: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2977) Google Scholar). There has also been reports of divergent transcription of short RNAs flanking transcriptional start sites of the active promoters (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, Preker et al., 2008Preker P. Nielsen J. Kammler S. Lykke-Andersen S. Christensen M.S. Mapendano C.K. Schierup M.H. Jensen T.H.

In search of a function for long ncRNAs, we used the GENCODE annotation (Harrow et al., 2006Harrow J. Denoeud F. Frankish A. Reymond A. Chen C.K. Chrast J. Lagarde J. Gilbert J.G. Storey R. Swarbreck D. et al.GENCODE: producing a reference annotation for ENCODE.Genome Biol. 2006; 7 (S4 1–9)Crossref Google Scholar) of the human genome. To simplify our search we subtracted transcripts overlapping the protein-coding genes. Moreover, we filtered out the transcripts that may correspond to promoters of protein-coding genes and the transcripts that belong to known classes of ncRNAs. We identified 3019 putative long ncRNAs that display differential patterns of expression. Functional knockdown of multiple ncRNAs revealed their positive influence on the neighboring protein-coding genes. Furthermore, detailed functional analysis of a long ncRNA adjacent to the Snai1 locus using reporter assays demonstrated a role for this ncRNA in an RNA-dependent potentiation of gene expression. Our studies suggest a role for a class of long ncRNAs in positive regulation of protein-coding genes. To assign a function to uncharacterized human long ncRNAs, we identified unique long noncoding transcripts using the annotation of the human genome provided by the GENCODE (Harrow et al., 2006Harrow J. Denoeud F. Frankish A. Reymond A. Chen C.K. Chrast J. Lagarde J. Gilbert J.G. Storey R. Swarbreck D. et al.GENCODE: producing a reference annotation for ENCODE.Genome Biol. 2006; 7 (S4 1–9)Crossref Google Scholar) and performed by human and vertebrate analysis and annotation (HAVANA) group at Sanger Institute. Such genomic annotation is being produced in the framework of the ENCODE project (Birney et al., 2007Birney E. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Dutta A. Guigo R. Gingeras T.R. Margulies E.H. Weng Z. Snyder M. Dermitzakis E.T. Thurman R.E. et al.Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project.Nature. 2007; 447: 799-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (3837) Google Scholar). At the time of our analysis, the GENCODE annotation encompassed about one third of the human genome. Such an annotation relies on the human expert curation of all available experimental data on transcriptional evidence, such as cloned cDNA sequences, spliced RNAs and ESTs mapped on to the human genome. We focused on ncRNAs that do not overlap the protein-coding genes in order to simplify the interpretation of our functional analysis of ncRNAs. This included the subtraction of all transcripts mapping to exons, introns and the antisense transcripts overlapping the protein-coding genes. We also excluded transcripts within 1 kb of the first and the last exons as to avoid promoter and 3′-associated transcripts (Fejes-Toth et al., 2009Fejes-Toth K. Sotirova V. Sachidanandam R. Assaf G. Hannon G.J. Kapranov P. Foissac S. Willingham A.T. Duttagupta R. Dumais E. Gingeras T.R.

Hofacker I.L. et al.RNA maps reveal new RNA classes and a possible function for pervasive transcription.Science. 2007; 316: 1484-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), that display a complicated pattern of short transcripts (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, Preker et al., 2008Preker P.

Furthermore, we excluded all known noncoding transcripts from our list of putative long ncRNAs. This analysis resulted in 3019 ncRNAs, which are annotated by HAVANA to have no coding potential, expressed from 2286 unique loci (some loci display multiple alternative spliced transcripts) of the human genome (Experimental Procedures, Table S1 available online). The average size of the noncoding transcripts is about 800 nts with a range from 100 nts to 9100 nts. Interestingly, the long ncRNAs display a simpler transcription unit than that of protein-coding genes (Figure S1A ). Nearly 50% of our long ncRNAs contain a single intron in their primary transcript (Figure S1A). Moreover, analysis of their chromatin signatures indicated similarities with protein-coding genes. Transcriptionally active ncRNAs display histone H3K4 trimethylation at their 5′-end (Figure S1B) and histone H3K36 trimethylation in the body of the gene (Figure S1C). Analysis of protein coding potential of the ncRNAs using GeneID (Blanco et al., 2007Blanco E. Parra G. Guigo R. Using geneid to identify genes.Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2007; (Chapter 4, Unit 4 3)PubMed Google Scholar, Parra et al., 2000Parra G. Blanco E. Guigo R. GeneID in Drosophila.Genome Res. 2000; 10: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) shows ncRNAs coding potential comparable to that of ancestral repeats (Lunter et al., 2006Lunter G. Ponting C.P. Hein J. Genome-wide identification of human functional DNA using a neutral indel model.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e5Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), supporting the HAVANA annotation of these transcripts as noncoding (Figure 1A ). Moreover, comparison of ncRNAs with protein-coding genes and control sequences corresponding to ancestral repeats (Lunter et al., 2006Lunter G. Ponting C.P. Hein J. Genome-wide identification of human functional DNA using a neutral indel model.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e5Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) reveals that ncRNA sequence conservation is lower than that of protein-coding genes, but higher than that of ancestral repeats (Figure 1B). A similar case is seen with the promoter regions (Figure 1C). These results are in concordance with previous observations in the mouse genome (Guttman et al., 2009Guttman M. Amit I. Garber M. French C. Lin M.F. Feldser D. Huarte M. Zuk O. Carey B.W. Cassady J.P. et al.Chromatin signature reveals over a thousand highly conserved large non-coding RNAs in mammals.Nature. 2009; 458: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2977) Google Scholar, Ponting et al., 2009Ponting C.P. Oliver P.L. Reik W. Evolution and functions of long noncoding RNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 629-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3554) Google Scholar). Next we used custom-made microarrays (Experimental Procedures) which were designed to include an average of six probes (nonrepetitive sequences) against each ncRNA transcript to detect their expression. We analyzed the expression pattern of ncRNAs using three different human cell lines (Figure 1D). Overall, we detected 1167 ncRNAs expressed in at least one of the three cell types and 576 transcripts common among the three cell types (Figure 1D). We validated the expression of 16 ncRNAs that mapped to the 1% of the human genome investigated by the original ENCODE study (Birney et al., 2007Birney E. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Dutta A. Guigo R. Gingeras T.R. Margulies E.H. Weng Z. Snyder M. Dermitzakis E.T. Thurman R.E. et al.Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project.Nature. 2007; 447: 799-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (3837) Google Scholar) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in three different cell lines (Table S2). Furthermore, we could find evidence for expression of 80% of our noncoding transcripts in at least one human tissue in a recent high throughput sequencing of the human transcriptome (Wang et al., 2008Wang E.T. Sandberg R. Luo S. Khrebtukova I. Zhang L. Mayr C. Kingsmore S.F. Schroth G.P. Burge C.B. Alternative isoform regulation in human tissue transcriptomes.Nature. 2008; 456: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). To assess whether ncRNAs respond to cellular differentiating signals, we induced the differentiation of human primary keratinocytes using 12-O-tetradecanoylphobol 13-acetate (TPA). We monitored the expression of ncRNAs using custom microarrays. Expression of protein-coding genes was monitored using conventional Agilent arrays containing nearly all human mRNAs. We prepared RNA from human primary keratinocytes before and following treatment with TPA. As shown in Figure 2A and Table S3, we could detect 687 ncRNAs in keratinocytes, where 104 (or 15.1%) respond to TPA treatment by over 1.5-fold. Similarly, 21.3% of protein coding-genes display a change in expression of over 1.5-fold (Figure 2B). While around half of the TPA-regulated protein-coding genes increase and a similar proportion decrease their expression following differentiation, 70% of the TPA-regulated ncRNAs increase their expression whereas only 30% show a decrease (Figures 2A and 2B). Furthermore, analysis of the protein-coding genes in the 500 kb window surrounding the TPA-regulated ncRNAs indicates a significant enrichment in genes involved in differentiation and morphogenesis (Figure 2C). An example of such change in expression of an important gene involved in extra-cellular matrix is shown in Figure 2D. Extracellular Matrix Protein 1 (ECM1) gene and an ncRNA adjacent to it displayed a 5 and 1.7 fold induction following TPA treatment, respectively. (Figure 2D, upper panel). qPCR analysis shows the TPA-mediated induction of ECM1 and the ncRNA as 14 and 4 fold, respectively (Figure 2D, bottom panel). Taken together, we found that many of the GENCODE annotated transcripts are expressed in multiple cell lines and that they display gene expression responsiveness to differentiation signals. To assess the function of our set of long ncRNAs, we reasoned that similar to long ncRNAs function at the imprinting loci, our collection of ncRNAs may act to regulate their neighboring genes. To test this hypothesis, we used RNA interference to deplete a set of ncRNAs. We initially chose ncRNAs that showed a differential expression following keratinocyte differentiation. However, to obtain a reproducible knockdown we had to use cell lines that are permissive to transfection by siRNAs. We used five different cell lines for our analyses in which the candidate ncRNAs display a detectable expression (Figure 3). We validated the expression of our experimental set of ncRNAs and the absence of protein-coding potential using rapid amplification of 5′ and 3′ complementary DNA ends (5′ and 3′ RACE), PCR and in vitro translation (Figure S3). These experiments confirmed the expression of ncRNAs and showed that they do not yield a product in an in vitro translation assay (Figures S3A and S3B), supporting the noncoding annotation of our set of ncRNAs. In two cases, the ncRNAs adjacent to Snai2 and TAL1 loci, we found evidence of a longer ncRNA transcript than that annotated by HAVANA (Figure S3).Figure S3Characterization of the Analyzed ncRNA-Activators, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) RACE analysis of the identified ncRNA-a using the primers indicated (left panel) for 5′ and 3′ RACE analysis (middle panel).

We began by examining small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against the ncRNA next to ECM1 in order to assess its functional role following its depletion (for reasons that will follow, this class of RNA is designated as noncoding RNA-activating1 through 7, ncRNA-a1-7). HEK293 cells were used for these experiments because of the ease of functional knockdown and the detectable amounts of ncRNA-a1 and ECM1 in this cell line. We compared the results obtained using two siRNAs against ncRNA-a1 to data obtained following the transfection of two control siRNAs (for the visual simplicity only one siRNA is shown (Figure 3A), the values for both siRNAs can be seen in Table S4). The two siRNAs produced comparable results. We interrogated a 300 kb window around the ncRNA-a1 containing six protein-coding genes using qPCR. Surprisingly, unlike the silencing action of long ncRNAs in imprinting and X-inactivation, depletion of ncRNA-a1 adjacent to ECM1 resulted in a concomitant decrease in expression of the neighboring ECM1 gene (Figure 3A). This effect was specific, as we did not detect any change in the other protein-coding genes surrounding ncRNA-a1 (Figure 3A). To ascertain that ncRNA-a1 is not a component of the ECM1 3′ untranslated region, we used primer pairs spanning the ECM1 and ncRNA-a1 genes. We were not able to detect a transcript comprised of the two genes in HEK293 cells, supporting the contention that the two transcripts are independent transcriptional units (Figure S2A). Furthermore, published ChIP experiments (Euskirchen et al., 2007Euskirchen G.M. Rozowsky J.S. Wei C.L. Lee W.H. Zhang Z.D. Hartman S. Emanuelsson O. Stolc V. Weissman S. Gerstein M.B. et al.Mapping of transcription factor binding regions in mammalian cells by ChIP: comparison of array- and sequencing-based technologies.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 898-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) show the presence of RNA polymerase II and trimethyl H3K4 peaks at the transcription start site of ncRNA-a1 in several cell lines, further attesting to an independent transcriptional start site for ncRNA-a1. Moreover, knocking down the ECM1 gene did not affect the expression level of ncRNA-a1 or any of the other protein-coding genes analyzed in the locus, further supporting the independence of ECM1 transcript from that of ncRNA-a1 (Figure S2B). Next we analyzed ncRNA-a2 flanking the histone demethylase JARID1B/KDAM 5B which also shows increased expression following keratinocyte differentiation. These experiments were performed in HeLa cells as they showed detectable expression of ncRNA-a2. Interestingly, while depletion of ncRNA-a2 did not change JARID1B/KDAM 5B levels, the KLHL12, a gene known for its negative regulation of the Wnt-beta catenin pathway, on the opposite strand displayed a significant reduction (Figure 3B). Although the decrease in KLHL12 was small (about 20%), no other protein-coding gene in the locus displayed a difference in expression (Figure 3B). To extend our findings and to determine whether regulation of neighboring protein-coding genes is a common function of ncRNAs, we interrogated the ncRNA-a3 flanking the stem cell leukemia gene (SCL, also called TAL1). TAL1 is a basic helix-loop-helix protein which serves as the master regulator of hematopoiesis (Lecuyer and Hoang, 2004Lecuyer E. Hoang T. SCL: from the origin of hematopoiesis to stem cells and leukemia.Exp. Hematol. 2004; 32: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This locus contains two ncRNAs on different strands of DNA. We used MCF-7 cells to assess the depletion of ncRNA-a3, since the expression of ncRNA-a3 and TAL1 could be readily detected in these cells. However, neither PDZK1IP1 nor ncRNA-a4 could be detected by qPCR in MCF-7 cells. Depletion of ncRNA-a3 resulted in a specific and potent reduction of TAL1 expression (Figure 3C). While depletion of ncRNA-a3 did not affect either STIL or CMPK1 genes, a significant reduction in CYP4A11 gene on the opposite strand of the DNA was detected (Figure 3C). We next turned our attention to ncRNA-a4 which was not expressed at a detectable level in MCF7 cells. We could reliably detect ncRNA-a4 in Jurkat cells. While we could not efficiently knockdown ncRNA-a3 in Jurkat cells, siRNAs specific to ncRNA-a4 reproducibly reduced its levels by about 50% (Figure 3D). Importantly, reduced levels of ncRNA-a4 resulted in a consistent and significant decrease in the level of the gene CMPK1 which is over 150 kb downstream of ncRNA-a4 (Figure 3D). We do not detect any changes in the other protein-coding genes surrounding ncRNA-a4. Next we depleted ncRNA-a5 which is adjacent to the E2F6 gene, an important component of a polycomb-like complex (Ogawa et al., 2002Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. A complex with chromatin modifiers that occupies E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in G0 cells.Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Knockdown of ncRNA-a5 did not affect the E2F6 gene. However, depletion of ncRNA-a5 resulted in a specific reduction in ROCK2 expression levels in HeLa cells, which is located upstream of ncRNA-a5 (Figure 3E). Finally, we examined the Snai1 and Snai2 loci in A549 cells (Figure 3F and Figure 4). The Snail family of transcription factors are implicated in the differentiation of epithelia cells into mesenchymal cells (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) during embryonic development (Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005Barrallo-Gimeno A.

Leaving the neighborhood: molecular mechanisms involved during epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Bioessays. 2001; 23: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Snai2 shows a significant reduction in expression when the adjacent ncRNA-a6 is depleted, an effect that is not seen on EFCAB1, the only other protein-coding gene within 300 kb of the ncRNA-a6 (Figure 3F). In total, we have examined 12 loci where we were able to efficiently knockdown the ncRNAs using siRNAs (Table S5). We were able to show that in 7 cases, the ncRNA acts to potentiate the expression of a protein-coding gene within 300 kb of the ncRNA. It is possible that the remaining ncRNAs which did not display a positive effect on the neighboring genes within the 300 kb window, exert their action over longer distances which was not assessed in our analysis. Taken together, our results indicate that a subset of ncRNAs has activating functions and therefore we have named them ncRNA-activator (ncRNA-a) followed by a number to distinguish each activating long ncRNA. As mentioned above, Snai1 is a member of the Snail zinc-finger family, which comprises transcription factors with diverse functions in development and disease (Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005Barrallo-Gimeno A.

The Snail gene family is conserved among species from Drosophila to human and has been shown to function as mesodermal determinant genes (Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005Barrallo-Gimeno A.

https://openalex.org/W2160779535,"In the adult hippocampus, neuroprogenitor cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus give rise to newborn neuroblasts. However, only a small subset of these cells integrates into the hippocampal circuitry as mature neurons at the end of a 4 week period. Here, we show that the majority of the newborn cells undergo death by apoptosis in the first 1 to 4 days of their life, during the transition from amplifying neuroprogenitors to neuroblasts. These apoptotic newborn cells are rapidly cleared out through phagocytosis by unchallenged microglia present in the adult SGZ niche. Phagocytosis by the microglia is efficient and undeterred by increased age or inflammatory challenge. Our results suggest that the main critical period of newborn cell survival occurs within a few days of birth and reveal a new role for microglia in maintaining the homeostasis of the baseline neurogenic cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2144328273,"Chromatin is important for the regulation of transcription and other functions, yet the diversity of chromatin composition and the distribution along chromosomes are still poorly characterized. By integrative analysis of genome-wide binding maps of 53 broadly selected chromatin components in Drosophila cells, we show that the genome is segmented into five principal chromatin types that are defined by unique yet overlapping combinations of proteins and form domains that can extend over > 100 kb. We identify a repressive chromatin type that covers about half of the genome and lacks classic heterochromatin markers. Furthermore, transcriptionally active euchromatin consists of two types that differ in molecular organization and H3K36 methylation and regulate distinct classes of genes. Finally, we provide evidence that the different chromatin types help to target DNA-binding factors to specific genomic regions. These results provide a global view of chromatin diversity and domain organization in a metazoan cell."

This similarity has been demonstrated by gene expression profiling and epigenetic signatures as well as by differentiation potential. The expected impact of cellular reprogramming on the future of medicine cannot be overestimated given that it promises to provide an unlimited source of patient specific cells for replacement therapy and for the study of genetic diseases. However, the benefits of HiPSCs could be jeopardized by safety concerns such as their tumorigenicity. Although much effort has been recently made to reduce potential hazardous effects of the reprogramming vectors, there is a need for a thorough analysis of the reprogrammed cells' propensity for chromosomal aberrations. Thus far, no major aneuploidy has yet been demonstrated to occur in HiPSCs. In comparison, although HESCs were initially considered to have a stable normal genome copy number, it is now widely accepted that during long-term culture of the cells they stochastically acquire chromosomal aberrations that may confer a growth advantage so that the aneuploid cells quickly take over the population (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E. Harrison N.J. Maltby E. Smith K. Moore H.D. Shaw P.J. Heath P.R. Holden H. Andrews P.W. Adaptation to culture of human embryonic stem cells and oncogenesis in vivo.Nat.

Such progressive adaptive copy number aberrations are most commonly identified in chromosomes 12, 17 and X (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E. Harrison N.J. Maltby E. Smith K. Moore H.D. Shaw P.J.

The genetic integrity of ESCs and iPSCs was previously analyzed mostly by karyotype, but also at high resolution with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Such analyses directly measure either DNA content or chromosome morphology. We now suggest that the chromosomal integrity of HESCs and HiPSCs can be examined by transcriptional profiling, to identify genomic regions containing large clusters of genes with significantly higher or lower levels of gene expression. This is possible by comparison of each individual gene expression profile to a reference baseline made up of a very large number of highly similar cell lines. In recent years the correlation between copy number and levels of gene expression has been extensively recognized, primarily in cancers, but also in natural human and rodent populations (Guryev et al., 2008Guryev V.

The ability to detect genomic aberrations with data from gene expression arrays enables a comprehensive study of genomic aberrations in multiple lines from various laboratories. Such analysis cannot be currently performed by direct DNA analysis, given that much of the biological material is not available. Here, we applied two complementary tests to identify regions of presumed aneuploidy in pluripotent stem cells on the basis of their global gene expression profile. Gene expression data consisted of 104 unique gene expression profiles from 18 studies; 38 samples of 17 unique HESC lines and 66 samples (clones and subclones) of 46 unique HiPSC lines originating from 17 independent somatic cell lines (See Tables S1 and S2 available online). Analysis was performed on expressed genes with known chromosomal location only. Data were further filtered to retain only a single instance of each autosomal gene, resulting in a total of 12,054 data points. For each sample, the expression value of each gene was divided by the median of the same gene across the entire dataset, in order to obtain a comparative value. These values were then used in two statistical tests in order to assess aneuploidy. In the first test, overexpressed genes were determined for each sample (>1.5 fold, relative to the median) and then subjected to location enrichment analysis, using two gene expression analysis software: Expander (Sharan et al., 2003Sharan R. Maron-Katz A. Shamir R. CLICK and EXPANDER: A system for clustering and visualizing gene expression data.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1787-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and EASE (Hosack et al., 2003Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Identifying biological themes within lists of genes with EASE.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the second test, we applied the processed expression data to comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis software, CGH-Explorer (Lingjaerde et al., 2005Lingjaerde O.C. Baumbusch L.O. Liestøl K. Glad I.K. Børresen-Dale A.L. CGH-Explorer: A program for analysis of array-CGH data.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 821-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using the program's piecewise constant fit (PCF) algorithm, we were able to analyze gene expression regional bias in all our samples by using a constant set of parameters. The results of the PCF can often be clearly seen in a moving average plot of the gene expression profile. It is important to note that although both methods rely on the same expression data, they are complementary. The first method counts genes that are clearly overexpressed and tests for chromosomal enrichment, whereas the second method analyzes the spatial expression pattern of all expressed genes. To explore the potential of this system to identify aneuploidy, we first analyzed two HESC lines predetermined by preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) to harbor a single trisomic chromosome each, either 17 or 21. These trisomies were verified by high-density SNP-array copy number analysis (Figure 1A ). Gene expression profiling was performed for these cell lines in parallel with the genomic analysis. The trisomic chromosomes (17 and 21) were found to have highly significant over-representation of overexpressed genes (Bonferroni corrected p values = 1 × 10−7 by Expander and 2.1 × 10−9 by EASE, for chromosome 17; 4.9 × 10−4 by Expander and 1.1 × 10−10 by EASE, for chromosome 21), (Figure 1B and Figure S1A). These results were verified by the PCF algorithm and are also clearly visible with a moving average plot relative to similarly derived normal diploid cells (Figure 1C). Most aneuploidies in HESCs were identified in culture-adapted cells (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E. Harrison N.J. Maltby E. Smith K. Moore H.D. Shaw P.J. Heath P.R. Holden H. Andrews P.W. Adaptation to culture of human embryonic stem cells and oncogenesis in vivo.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, Draper et al., 2004Draper J.S. Moore H.D. Ruban L.N. Gokhale P.J. Andrews P.W. Culture and characterization of human embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells Dev. 2004; 13: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Such cytogenetically verified chromosomes and chromosome arms were correctly identified by enrichment analysis of the overexpressed genes (Figures 1D and 1E and Figures S1B–S1D). The entire set of identified trisomies analyzed by the expression profile of HESCs is shown in Table S1. Next, we explored the possibility of using PCF to detect subchromosomal gains or losses in the HESC data set. This method could detect both cytogenetically verified multiple copy amplification (Figure 1F) and single-copy duplication (Figure 1G). Analysis of the entire HESC data set revealed chromosomal aberrations in 12 out of the 38 cell lines. Eight of these aberrations involved entire chromosomes or large chromosomal regions that were thus apparent by both expression analyses, three of which could be confirmed by karyotype (Table S1). Not all the aberrations identified by gene expression could be analyzed cytogenetically because of lack of corresponding cells or DNA from similar passage. Notably, the most recurrent duplications were in chromosomes 12 and 17 (three cell lines each), coinciding with their previously suggested role in embryonic tumors and ESC adaptation (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E. Harrison N.J. Maltby E. Smith K. Moore H.D. Shaw P.J. Heath P.R. Holden H. Andrews P.W. Adaptation to culture of human embryonic stem cells and oncogenesis in vivo.Nat.

Pathol. 2005; 18: S51-S60Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Table S1, Figures 1D–1F, and Figures S1B–S1D). HiPSCs are similar to HESCs in many respects, even though some differences have been observed between the two cell types (Chin et al., 2009Chin M.H. Mason M.J. Xie W. Volinia S. Singer M. Peterson C. Ambartsumyan G. Aimiuwu O. Richter L. Zhang J. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells are distinguished by gene expression signatures.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 111-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Although it might be presumed that HiPSCs would acquire genetic abnormalities in a similar manner to HESCs, the unique nature of their derivation may make them different in this regard. We thus aimed to analyze the genetic instability of HiPSCs. Of the 66 HiPSC samples included in this study, two lines were previously reported to harbor two trisomic chromosomes each (chromosomes 1 and 9). Using the same methods and parameters as for HESCs, we correctly identified these aberrations (Figures 2A and 2B). Two other HiPSC studies reported subchromosomal genomic aberrations. In the study of Yu et al., 2009Yu J. Hu K. Smuga-Otto K. Tian S. Stewart R. Slukvin I.I. Thomson J.A. Human induced pluripotent stem cells free of vector and transgene sequences.Science. 2009; 324: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 16 HiPSC clones and subclones were determined to be normal by karyotype and a single small deletion in one subclone was identified by high-density CGH arrays (Yu et al., 2009Yu J. Hu K. Smuga-Otto K. Tian S. Stewart R. Slukvin I.I. Thomson J.A. Human induced pluripotent stem cells free of vector and transgene sequences.Science. 2009; 324: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Here, by examining the corresponding gene expression data, we identified the same small deletion in chromosome 15 as the sole aneuploidy in the entire set of samples from this study (Figure 2C). In another study (Chin et al., 2009Chin M.H. Mason M.J. Xie W. Volinia S. Singer M. Peterson C. Ambartsumyan G. Aimiuwu O. Richter L. Zhang J. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells are distinguished by gene expression signatures.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 111-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), CGH-array analysis revealed a number of possible aberrations at varying confidence levels, the three most significant of which were correctly reproduced by our gene expression analysis (Figures S2A–S2C). However, the events that were suggested by CGH at low confidence were not detected by this analysis. This could suggest that gene expression-based analysis might not be adequate to detect changes in a minority of cells within a mixed population. In addition to the verification of previously reported genetic abnormalities, we could identify many chromosomal aberrations that were established early on during the isolation of HiPSCs, or during their prolonged culture. As seen in Figure 2D, the HiPSC line, HiPSC1-8 (Masaki et al., 2007Masaki H. Ishikawa T. Takahashi S. Okumura M. Sakai N. Haga M. Kominami K. Migita H. McDonald F. Shimada F. et al.Heterogeneity of pluripotent marker gene expression in colonies generated in human iPS cell induction culture.Stem Cell Res. 2007; 1: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), contains an abnormally high frequency of overexpressed genes in chromosome 12, which is present already at passage 14, and the level of overexpressed genes is even higher at passage 31. The evidence of trisomy 12 is also very clear in the respective moving average plots, in which the aneuploidy is evident at low passage and takes over the culture at the higher passage (Figure 2E). Another cell line, hiPSC18 (Chin et al., 2009Chin M.H. Mason M.J. Xie W. Volinia S. Singer M. Peterson C. Ambartsumyan G. Aimiuwu O. Richter L. Zhang J. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells are distinguished by gene expression signatures.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 111-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, Lowry et al., 2008Lowry W.E. Richter L. Yachechko R. Pyle A.D. Tchieu J. Sridharan R. Clark A.T. Plath K. Generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells from dermal fibroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2883-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), was found normal by gene expression analysis at passage 9, whereas by passage 56 both PCF and Expander/EASE analyses predicted gains in chromosomes 3 and 12 (Figures S2D and S2E). Because chromosomal duplications can occur in some cell lines after a relative small number of passages, as described above, we speculated it might be possible to enhance or generate them de novo by growing these cells in culture. Therefore, we decided to re-examine the hiPSC18 line (Chin et al., 2009Chin M.H. Mason M.J. Xie W. Volinia S. Singer M. Peterson C. Ambartsumyan G. Aimiuwu O. Richter L. Zhang J. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells are distinguished by gene expression signatures.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 111-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, Lowry et al., 2008Lowry W.E.

USA. 2008; 105: 2883-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), which seemed susceptible to chromosomal aberrations. This cell line had a normal karyotype at passage 45 (20/20 metaphases, Figure 3A ) and was further grown until passage 63, when it was analyzed in parallel by karyotype and gene expression. Interestingly, these cells acquired a full trisomy of chromosome 12, as demonstrated by karyotype analysis (Figure 3C). Moreover, both the Expander/EASE and the PCF analyses correctly identified the trisomy while not identifying any false duplication or deletion (Figures 3D–3F). We can thus suggest that this trisomy may confer a major growth advantage, as is evident from the rapid rate in which it is acquired, coinciding with the high frequency at which this particular aberration has been found in our study (Figure 4A ). In order to learn more about the selection for the aneuploid cells, we performed karyotype analysis at passage 58 of the same line (five passages prior to the full trisomy detection). At this passage, the culture was found to be mosaic, comprising both normal and trisomic cells (47,XY,+12[9]/46,XY[11], Figure 3B). These results suggest a rapid selection for cells with trisomy 12, as was previously shown in HESCs for trisomy 17 (Olariu et al., 2010Olariu V. Harrison N.J. Coca D. Gokhale P.J. Baker D.

(F) Schematic model of the different types of chromosomal aberrations found in HiPSCs: aberrations with somatic cell origin (“A”); aberrations present in early passage but without apparent somatic cell origin (“B”); and aberrations acquired during prolonged culture (“C”). All together, of the 66 HiPSC samples analyzed, we identified thirteen (∼20%) abnormal lines, of which six (∼9%) carried at least one full trisomy (Table S2). Cytogenetic information from similar passage was available for nine of the aberrations and all agreed with these findings (Table S2). Thus, we found many more aberrations than were reported in the original studies. This may be due to the higher resolution of the present analysis, but in some cases can also be attributed to the fact that in many cases gene expression and cytogenetic analyses presented by the original studies were conducted at different passages. The complete list of genomic aberrations identified in HiPSCs is presented as Table S2. A schematic representation of the PCF results is presented in Figure 4A, and gene level PCF calls are presented in Tables S3A and S3B. Investigation of the frequency of copy number gains in HiPSCs demonstrates that chromosome 12 (and specifically 12p) is the most recurrent (Figure 4A). This abnormality has been described as a hallmark of testicular germ cell tumors (Reuter, 2005Reuter V.E. Origins and molecular biology of testicular germ cell tumors.Mod. Pathol. 2005; 18: S51-S60C"

Here, we report the genome-wide binding patterns and combinatorial interactions for ten key regulators of blood stem/progenitor cells (SCL/TAL1, LYL1, LMO2, GATA2, RUNX1, MEIS1, PU.1, ERG, FLI-1, and GFI1B), thus providing the most comprehensive TF data set for any adult stem/progenitor cell type to date. Genome-wide computational analysis of complex binding patterns, followed by functional validation, revealed the following: first, a previously unrecognized combinatorial interaction between a heptad of TFs (SCL, LYL1, LMO2, GATA2, RUNX1, ERG, and FLI-1). Second, we implicate direct protein-protein interactions between four key regulators (RUNX1, GATA2, SCL, and ERG) in stabilizing complex binding to DNA. Third, Runx1(+/-)::Gata2(+/-) compound heterozygous mice are not viable with severe hematopoietic defects at midgestation. Taken together, this study demonstrates the power of genome-wide analysis in generating novel functional insights into the transcriptional control of stem and progenitor cells."

In contrast, astrocytes and ependymal cells, which are restricted to limited self-duplication in the intact spinal cord, generate the largest number of cells after spinal cord injury.

Oligodendrocyte progenitors continuously make oligodendrocytes in the adult spinal cord Ependymal cells contribute to remyelination after injury Astrocytes and ependymal cells generate the glial scar after spinal cord injury Neural stem cell properties are restricted to the ependymal cell population A major challenge in developmental biology and regenerative medicine is to understand the origin of cells. Once development is completed, the number of cells in adult tissues can be maintained by duplication of differentiated cells or by the generation of new cells from stem or progenitor cells. Most tissues are composed of a variety of differentiated cells of different lineages and it is poorly understood how their numbers are maintained in adult tissues during homeostasis and in response to injury. The adult central nervous system was considered a comparatively static tissue with little cell turnover. It is well established today that there is more plasticity than previously thought and that new neurons are produced continuously from stem cells in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao C. Deng W. Gage F.H. Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis.Cell. 2008; 132: 645-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). In most parts of the central nervous system, however, neurons are not added in adulthood and there is limited cell turnover. Nevertheless, cells with neural stem cell properties can be isolated from most regions of the adult central nervous system, including, for example, the spinal cord (Johansson et al., 1999Johansson C.B.

Spinal cord injury is often mentioned among the first conditions for which stem cells may provide a new therapy. There are several studies indicating that transplantation of neural stem cells or cells derived from embryonic stem cells to the injured spinal cord have a beneficial effect on functional recovery in experimental models, although the mechanism is poorly understood (Barnabé-Heider and Frisén, 2008Barnabé-Heider F. Frisén J. Stem cells for spinal cord repair.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 16-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Improved functional recovery after transplantation of in vitro expanded neural stem cells derived from the adult spinal cord (Hofstetter et al., 2005Hofstetter C.P. Holmström N.A. Lilja J.A. Schweinhardt P. Hao J. Spenger C. Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Kurpad S.N. Frisén J. Olson L. Allodynia limits the usefulness of intraspinal neural stem cell grafts; directed differentiation improves outcome.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) demonstrates that there are stem cells in the adult spinal cord that can exert beneficial effects after injury, but fail to do so efficiently under normal conditions. Identification of stem and progenitor cells in the adult spinal cord and an understanding of their response to injury could allow the development of pharmacological strategies to modulate these cells in situ to produce desired progeny after injury as an alternative to cell transplantation. Oligodendrocyte progenitors, ependymal cells, and astrocytes have all been suggested to act as neural stem cells in the adult spinal cord (Horner et al., 2000Horner P.J. Power A.E. Kempermann G.

Indirect data from viral labeling of proliferating cells and lineage analysis from embryonic stages have led to the suggestion that oligodendrocyte progenitors in the adult spinal cord have neural stem cell properties and produce cells of multiple lineages in vivo (Horky et al., 2006Horky L.L.

Ependymal cells give rise to differentiated progeny after injury and constitute the main cell population in the intact spinal cord with in vitro neural stem cell properties (Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K.

Ide C. Increase in bFGF-responsive neural progenitor population following contusion injury of the adult rodent spinal cord.Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 397: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was unknown. Astrocytes act as neural stem cells and give rise to new neurons in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus. Astrocytes in other parts of the central nervous system display little proliferative activity, yet cortical astrocytes gain in vitro neural stem cell properties after injury (Buffo et al., 2008Buffo A. Rite I. Tripathi P. Lepier A. Colak D. Horn A.P. Mori T. Götz M. Origin and progeny of reactive gliosis: A source of multipotent cells in the injured brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). There are thus three distinct cell populations in the adult spinal cord that have been suggested to act as neural stem cells and to contribute to cell turnover. The relationship between these cell types, for example whether they can give rise to each other, if they all have stem cell properties, and their relative contribution to cell turnover in the intact and injured spinal cord, had not been addressed. We have in parallel performed genetic fate mapping of oligodendrocyte progenitors, ependymal cells, and astrocytes in the adult mouse spinal cord, allowing us to assess the relative roles of these cell populations in cell turnover in the intact and injured spinal cord. We present an integrated view of how differentiated cells, progenitors, and stem cells cooperate in complementary ways to generate new glial cells in the intact and injured adult spinal cord. In order to assess cell turnover in the adult mouse spinal cord, we first characterized which cell types proliferate. BrdU administration via the drinking water for 5 weeks resulted in labeled cells scattered within all areas of the spinal cord (Figure 1A ). Ependymal cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte lineage cells together accounted for the vast majority of BrdU-labeled cells (93.4% ± 2.7%, mean ± SD) (Figures 1B–1D). The remaining BrdU-labeled cells are mainly microglia and blood vessel-associated cells (Horner et al., 2000Horner P.J. Power A.E. Kempermann G. Kuhn H.G. Palmer T.D. Winkler J. Thal L.J. Gage F.H. Proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells throughout the intact adult rat spinal cord.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2218-2228PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of BrdU-labeled cells was similar for Sox10+ oligodendrocyte lineage and ependymal cells (4%–5%) but substantially lower for astrocytes (<1%) (Figure 1E). Oligodendrocyte lineage cells were identified by the expression of Sox10, astrocytes by the expression of Sox9, and ependymal cells by their position and expression of Sox9 (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Oligodendrocyte progenitors express NG2 and are also referred to as NG2 cells or polydendrocytes (Nishiyama et al., 2009Nishiyama A. Komitova M. Suzuki R. Zhu X. Polydendrocytes (NG2 cells): multifunctional cells with lineage plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The few astrocytes that incorporated BrdU were most often located at the perimeter of the spinal cord white matter (Figure 1C). There was a large variation in proliferation rate within the oligodendroglial lineage, with oligodendrocyte progenitors displaying a high proliferation rate and mature oligodendrocytes being postmitotic (Figure 1E). Oligodendrocyte lineage cells are by far the most numerous of the proliferating cells and represent more than 80% of the BrdU-labeled cells in the adult spinal cord (Figure 1F). To trace the progeny of these proliferating cell populations, we employed genetic fate mapping with three different transgenic mouse lines expressing tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase (CreER) under different cell type-specific promoters. We used mice in which CreER expression was under the control of promoters with specific expression in ependymal cells (FoxJ1), astrocytes (Connexin 30), or oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Olig2). These mice were on R26R Cre-reporter background, which after tamoxifen administration leads to permanent and heritable expression of the reporter gene β-galactosidase (βgal) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The transgenic lines and labeling paradigms are depicted in Figure S1 available online. Tamoxifen was adminstered once daily for 5 days and phenotypic characterization of the recombined cells was performed 5 days later. The mice were 2–5 months old (Table S1). FoxJ1-CreER transgenic mice allow genetic recombination specifically in ependymal cells in the adult spinal cord (Figures 2A–2C ; Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. Spinal cord injury reveals multilineage differentiation of ependymal cells.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The recombined ependymal cells all have motile cilia and homogenously express, for example, Sox9 and Vimentin (Figures 2A–2C; Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. Spinal cord injury reveals multilineage differentiation of ependymal cells.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). About 80% of ependymal cells are genetically marked with the employed recombination strategy (Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K. Barnabé-Heider F. Carlén M. Evergren E. Tomilin N. Shupliakov O. Frisén J. Spinal cord injury reveals multilineage differentiation of ependymal cells.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). There are GFAP+ astrocyte processes within the ependymal layer and Olig2+ oligodendrocyte progenitors can be found in close vicinity, but ependymal cells express none of these markers and these cells are not recombined in FoxJ1-CreER mice (Figures 2B and 2C; Meletis et al., 2008Meletis K.

Spinal cord injury reveals multilineage differentiation of ependymal cells.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e182Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The gap junction protein Connexin 30 (Cx30) is specifically expressed in astrocytes in the nervous system (Kunzelmann et al., 1999Kunzelmann P. Schröder W. Traub O. Steinhäuser C. Dermietzel R.

Adhes. 2001; 8: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recombination is restricted to astrocytes in the adult brain of Cx30-CreER transgenic mice (Slezak et al., 2007Slezak M. Göritz C. Niemiec A. Frisén J. Chambon P. Metzger D. Pfrieger F.W. Transgenic mice for conditional gene manipulation in astroglial cells.Glia. 2007; 55: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the spinal cord, recombination in Cx30-CreER mice led to numerous labeled cells located throughout the parenchyma (Figures 2D–2F). Almost all recombined cells expressed Sox9 (99.5% ± 0.4%, mean ± SD) and GFAP (93.9% ± 2.4%, mean ± SD), a small subset located in the white matter expressed Vimentin, and the recombined cells were never found in the ependymal layer (Figures 2E and 2F; Figure S2A). Sox9-expressing cells in the parenchyma coexpressed the astrocytic markers GFAP and S100β, but never the oligodendrocyte lineage markers Sox10, NG2, or PDGFRα (Figure S2). The genetic labeling of astrocytes was efficient, with 74.7% ± 2.9% (mean ± SD) of parenchymal Sox9+ cells being recombined. Based on morphology and marker expression, we could identify three astrocytic subtypes that were recombined in Cx30-CreER mice (Figures 2D–2F; Figure S2A), one in the white matter and two different in the gray matter. White matter astrocytes expressed Sox9 and high levels of GFAP, but not Olig2. A small number of recombined cells in the gray matter was located very close to the ependymal layer, had a bipolar morphology, expressed Sox9 and high levels of GFAP, and were negative for Olig2 (Figure 2E; Figure S2A). However, the majority of recombined cells in the gray matter had the elaborate morphology of protoplasmatic astrocytes and expressed Sox9 and lower levels of GFAP mostly around the cell body. Surprisingly, we found that this class of gray matter astrocytes was positive for Olig2 (91.3% ± 4.0%, mean ± SD of all gray matter astrocytes) via two different specific antibodies (Figures S2A–S2C). We classified these cells as astrocytes, rather than oligodendrocyte lineage cells, based on the expression of the astrocytic markers GFAP and Sox9, the protoplasmatic astrocyte morphology, and the lack of the oligodendrocyte lineage markers Sox10 and NG2 (Figure 2F; Figure S2A). Olig2 is expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes in the adult spinal cord (Ohori et al., 2006Ohori Y. Yamamoto S. Nagao M. Sugimori M. Yamamoto N. Nakamura K. Nakafuku M.

We found Olig2-CreER recombined cells scattered within both the white and gray matter in the adult spinal cord (Figure 2G). Almost all recombined cells expressed Olig2 and Sox10 and a quarter of them were mature APC+ oligodendrocytes (Figure 2I). The recombination efficiency was lower in this line than the other two with 4.5% ± 0.1% (mean ± SD) of Sox10+ cells (all maturational stages in the oligodendrocyte lineage) being recombined. Importantly, whereas recombination was inefficient in mature oligodendrocytes, it was more efficient in oligodendrocyte progenitors, with 38% ± 14% (mean ± SD) of NG2+ cells being recombined. About two thirds of recombined cells were proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitors expressing NG2 and 23.5% ± 9.5% (mean ± SD, 3- to 5-month-old mice) of recombined cells had undergone division and were labeled with BrdU after 5 days administration in the drinking water (Figures 2H and 2I; Figure S2D). A very small fraction (0.9% ± 0.7%, mean ± SD) of recombined cells in the Olig2-CreER line were Olig2+ gray matter astrocytes expressing Sox9 and GFAP. This corresponds to <1% of gray matter astrocytes. The very inefficient recombination in Olig2+ astrocytes was fortuitous for the purpose of this study because it allowed us to distinguish the astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages in the Olig2-CreER and Cx30-CreER lines (Figure S2E). To identify the progeny of ependymal cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, the number and phenotype of recombined cells was analyzed 5 days and 4 months after tamoxifen-induced recombination (Figure S1B, Table S1). The total number of recombined cells did not change significantly in the FoxJ1-CreER or Cx30-CreER lines over time (Figure 3A ). The phenotype of the recombined cells at 4 months in both these lines was indistinguishable from that at 5 days after recombination (Figure S3), with all cells being ependymal cells in the FoxJ1-CreER line and all cells being astrocytes in the Cx30-CreER line. Thus, ependymal cells and astrocytes do not produce progeny of other fates in the uninjured spinal cord and their number stays constant, indicating that their proliferation serves to compensate for some cell loss to maintain the size of their cell populations. In contrast, the Olig2-CreER line showed a significant increase in the total number of recombined cells after 4 months. This increase was due to a larger number of labeled mature oligodendrocytes (APC+) whereas the number of labeled progenitors (NG2+) was largely unaltered (Figure 3A; Figure S3). The finding that the number of oligodendrocyte progenitors stayed constant indicates that these cells both self-renew and produce new mature oligodendrocytes. Mature oligodendrocytes are postmitotic but can be replenished from progenitor cells (Keirstead and Blakemore, 1997Keirstead H.S. Blakemore W.F. Identification of post-mitotic oligodendrocytes incapable of remyelination within the demyelinated adult spinal cord.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 1191-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To assess the potential addition of mature oligodendrocytes in an independent way, wild-type mice received BrdU in the drinking water for 5 weeks and were analyzed either at that time (5w) or after another 7 weeks after the end of BrdU administration (5w+7w). There was a significant increase with time in the proportion of BrdU-labeled mature oligodendrocytes, increasing from 17% ± 2.7% (mean ± SD) after 5 weeks of BrdU administration to 51% ± 1.2% (mean ± SD) of all BrdU-labeled cells 7 weeks later (Figures 3B and 3C). Moreover, direct counts of APC+ cells, independently of BrdU labeling, revealed a significant increase with time in the same animals (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Thus, in the uninjured adult spinal cord ependymal cells and astrocytes proliferate to maintain their population sizes whereas oligodendrocyte progenitors both self-renew and generate an increasing number of mature oligodendrocytes. We assessed the expression of markers associated with neural stem/progenitor cells in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the adult spinal cord. Sox2 is expressed by the vast majority, if not all, recombined cells in the FoxJ1-CreER and Cx30-CreER lines and in a subset of cells in the Olig2-CreER line. Musashi1 is highest expressed in ependymal cells, and CD133/prominin expression as well as Nestin second intron enhancer activity, both associated with neural stem cells (Carlén et al., 2006Carlén M.

Neurospheres appeared faster, were larger, and 3–4 times more numerous after injury (Figures 4A and 4B ). Injury-induced neurospheres displayed self-renewal and multipotency, as shown by the fact that they could be serially passaged and, when exposed to differentiating conditions, generated astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons at the clonal level (Figure 4A and see further below).

However, signaling events downstream of ABP1 and those underlying the control of cell polarization by auxin are unknown. Coordinated spatial control of cell expansion or asymmetry across an entire field of cells in a tissue is important for pattern formation and morphogenesis. In animals, this type of spatial coordination is required for cellular intercalation that drives convergent extensions during early embryogenesis (Green and Davidson, 2007Green J.B. Davidson L.A.

In addition, spatial coordination among epidermal cells is important for patterning of the epidermal tissues such as the positioning of root hairs and the jigsaw-puzzle appearance of pavement cells (PCs) in the leaf (Fischer et al., 2006Fischer U.

Cell polarity signaling in Arabidopsis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 551-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The jigsaw-puzzle appearance results from intercalary growth that produces interdigitated lobes and indentations (Figure 1A ). This cellular interdigitation resembles embryonic cell intercalation required for convergent extension in animal cells. Interestingly, these two distinct processes share common mechanisms, including Rho GTPase signaling and its effect on the cytoskseleton (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z.

ROP2 and ROP4, two functionally-overlapping members of the Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis, promote lobe development (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z. Arabidopsis interdigitating cell growth requires two antagonistic pathways with opposing action on cell morphogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Fu et al., 2002Fu, Y., Li, H., and Yang, Z. (2002). The ROP2 GTPase controls the formation of cortical fine F-actin and the early phase of directional cell expansion during Arabidopsis organogenesis. Plant Cell 14, 777–794.Google Scholar). ROP2, locally active at the lobe-forming site, promotes the formation of cortical diffuse F-actin and lobe outgrowth via its effector RIC4 (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z. Arabidopsis interdigitating cell growth requires two antagonistic pathways with opposing action on cell morphogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the lobe tips, ROP2 suppresses well-ordered cortical microtubule (MT) arrays by inactivating another effector, RIC1 (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z. Arabidopsis interdigitating cell growth requires two antagonistic pathways with opposing action on cell morphogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Fu et al., 2002Fu, Y., Li, H., and Yang, Z. (2002). The ROP2 GTPase controls the formation of cortical fine F-actin and the early phase of directional cell expansion during Arabidopsis organogenesis. Plant Cell 14, 777–794.Google Scholar), thus relieving MT-mediated outgrowth inhibition. In the opposing indenting zone, ROP6 activates RIC1 to promote well-ordered MTs and to suppress ROP2 activation (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z. Arabidopsis interdigitating cell growth requires two antagonistic pathways with opposing action on cell morphogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Fu et al., 2009Fu, Y., Xu, T., Zhu, L., Wen, M., and Yang, Z. (2009). A ROP GTPase signaling pathway controls cortical microtubule ordering and cell expansion in Arabidopsis. Curr. Biol. 19, 1827–1832.Google Scholar). What activates the ROP2 and ROP6 pathways and how these two pathways coordinate across cells to produce the cellular interdigitation remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that auxin promotes interdigitated PC expansion by coordinately activating the antagonistic ROP2 and ROP6 pathways in an ABP1-dependent manner and that ROP2 is required for the targeting of PIN1 to the lobing regions of the PM, which is crucial for the interdigitated PC expansion. These findings establish a molecular framework underpinning cellular interdigitation as well as an auxin-signaling mechanism that is downstream of ABP1 and required for cytoplasmic events including cytoskeletal organization, PIN protein targeting, and spatially coordinated cell expansion. Given the widespread role of auxin in plant pattern formation, we evaluated its involvement in the interdigitated growth of PCs in Arabidopsis. We first examined the effect of exogenous auxin on the degree of PC interdigitation, which was measured by the number of lobes per cell area in a two-dimensional plane of the leaf surface (Figure S1A available online). Treatments of wild-type (WT) seedlings with the synthetic auxin naphthalene-1-acetic acid (NAA) significantly increased PC interdigitation in a dose-dependent manner with an effective NAA concentration as low as 5 nM and optimal concentration around 20 nM (Figures 1B and 1C and Figure S1C).The requirement of endogenous auxin for PC interdigitation was investigated using mutants defective in YUCCA gene family-dependent auxin biosynthesis (Cheng et al., 2006Cheng Y. Dai X. Zhao Y. Auxin biosynthesis by the YUCCA flavin monooxygenases controls the formation of floral organs and vascular tissues in Arabidopsis.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1790-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2001Zhao Y.

The cotyledon PCs of the yuc1 yuc2 yuc4 yuc6 quadruple mutant, which accumulates a lower amount of auxin than the wild-type (Cheng et al., 2006Cheng Y. Dai X. Zhao Y. Auxin biosynthesis by the YUCCA flavin monooxygenases controls the formation of floral organs and vascular tissues in Arabidopsis.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1790-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), exhibited reduced interdigitation (Figures 1B and 1C). This yuc1 yuc2 yuc4 yuc6 PC phenotype resembled that of the ROP2RNAi rop4-1 line (Figures 1B and 1C), in which ROP2 and ROP4 expression is reduced (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z. Arabidopsis interdigitating cell growth requires two antagonistic pathways with opposing action on cell morphogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NAA treatment rescued the interdigitation defect of the yuc quadruple mutant but not that of the ROP2RNAi rop4-1 line (Figures 1B and 1C; Figures S1C and S1D). These results suggest that auxin is a signal that induces lobe formation possibly by activating ROP2 and ROP4. To test whether auxin activates ROP2, we first determined the effect of auxin on ROP2 activity using an effector binding-based assay (Baxter-Burrell et al., 2002Baxter-Burrell A. Yang Z. Springer P.S. Bailey-Serres J. RopGAP4-dependent Rop GTPase rheostat control of Arabidopsis oxygen deprivation tolerance.Science. 2002; 296: 2026-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) to measure active GTP-bound GFP-ROP2 in protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis leaves stably expressing GFP-ROP2. We found that ROP2 activity doubled by addition of as low as 1 nM NAA and reached saturation at 20–100 nM NAA (Figures 2A and 2B ), which is consistent with the concentrations of NAA for the induction of PC interdigitation (Figures S1C and S1F). Time course analysis showed that ROP2 activity doubled within 30 s after NAA treatment (Figure 2C and 2D). This is one of the most rapid auxin responses known to date, which suggests that auxin perception directly leads to ROP2 activation at the PM. Localization of GFP-RIC4 to the PM is a display of in vivo activation of ROP2, because RIC4 specifically binds the active form of PM-delimited ROPs (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G.

Gu Y. Lee Y.J. Yang Z. Oscillatory ROP GTPase activation leads the oscillatory polarized growth of pollen tubes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5385-5399Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In wild-type PCs, GFP-RIC4 was preferentially localized to the PM domains associated with initiating or growing lobes where ROP2 is activated. In the yuc quadruple mutant, GFP-RIC4 localization to these PM domains was reduced, with a corresponding increase of its level in the cytoplasm (Figures S2A and S2B ). Treatment with 20 nM auxin increased PM-associated GFP-RIC4 in this mutant (Figures S2A and S2B), but not in the rop2-1 rop4-1 double mutant (data not shown). Fine cortical F-actin, a RIC4 signaling target, was also markedly reduced in the yuc quadruple-mutant PCs as in the ROP2RNAi rop4-1 PCs (Fu et al., 2005Fu Y. Gu Y. Zheng Z. Wasteneys G. Yang Z. Arabidopsis interdigitating cell growth requires two antagonistic pathways with opposing action on cell morphogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) (Figure S2C). Taken together, our results indicate that auxin is required for localized ROP2 activation in the lobing region of PCs. There are two well-characterized receptor families in Arabidopsis, ABP1 and TIR1 proteins. The TIR1-family of F box proteins directly controls auxin-induced gene expression (Leyser, 2006Leyser O.

Because null alleles of abp1 are embryo lethal (Chen et al., 2001bChen J.G. Ullah H. Young J.C. Sussman M.R. Jones A.M.

PCs of abp1-5 cotyledons showed a defect similar to that observed in the yuc quadruple mutant (Figure 3B and 3C; Figure 1B and 1C). This defect was rescued to WT by transgenic expression of ABP1 (Figure S3A and S3B), confirming that the abp1-5 defect was due to the abp1-5 mutation. The role of ABP1 in PC interdigitation was further confirmed by inducible expression of an ABP1 antisense RNA and a RNA encoding single-chain fragment variable 12 derived from anti-ABP1 mAb12 antibody (Braun et al., 2008Braun N.

Unlike PCs in the yuc quadruple mutant, exogenous auxin did not induce lobe formation in PCs containing the abp1-5 mutation or expressing ABP1 antisense RNA (Figures 3B–3E and Figure S1E). Thus, we hypothesize that ABP1 perceives the auxin signal required for PC interdigitation.Figure S3Reduced ABP1 Function in the abp1-5 Tilling Line and Ethanol Inducible Antisense or Antibody Line Is Responsible for the PC Interdigitation Defect, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) After five rounds of backcrosses to the wild-type to eliminate background mutations in this tilling line, the PC interdigitation defect was retained, which suggests that the H59Y mutation was responsible for the phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2104766562,"Spatial distribution of the plant hormone auxin regulates multiple aspects of plant development. These self-regulating auxin gradients are established by the action of PIN auxin transporters, whose activity is regulated by their constitutive cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes. Here, we show that auxin signaling by the auxin receptor AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) inhibits the clathrin-mediated internalization of PIN proteins. ABP1 acts as a positive factor in clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting endocytosis. Auxin binding to ABP1 interferes with this action and leads to the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our study demonstrates that ABP1 mediates a nontranscriptional auxin signaling that regulates the evolutionarily conserved process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and suggests that this signaling may be essential for the developmentally important feedback of auxin on its own transport."

We show that myogenin, an essential regulator of muscle development, controls neurogenic atrophy. Myogenin is upregulated in skeletal muscle following denervation and regulates expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and atrogin-1, which promote muscle proteolysis and atrophy. Deletion of myogenin from adult mice diminishes expression of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 in denervated muscle and confers resistance to atrophy. Mice lacking histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4 and 5 in skeletal muscle fail to upregulate myogenin and also preserve muscle mass following denervation. Conversely, forced expression of myogenin in skeletal muscle of HDAC mutant mice restores muscle atrophy following denervation. Thus, myogenin plays a dual role as both a regulator of muscle development and an inducer of neurogenic atrophy.

Innervation of skeletal muscle fibers by motor neurons is essential for maintenance of muscle size, structure, and function. Numerous disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Guillain-Barré syndrome, polio, and polyneuropathy, disrupt the nerve supply to muscle, causing debilitating loss of muscle mass (referred to as neurogenic atrophy) and eventual paralysis. Loss of the nerve supply to muscle fibers results in muscle atrophy mainly through excessive ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the proteasome pathway (Beehler et al., 2006Beehler B.C. Sleph P.G.

Other pathologic states and systemic disorders, including cancer, diabetes, fasting, sepsis, and disuse, also cause muscle atrophy through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (Attaix et al., 2008Attaix D.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that control the expression of these key regulators of muscle protein turnover have not been fully defined and it remains unclear whether all types of atrophic signals control these E3 ubiquitin ligase genes through the same or different mechanisms. Further understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate muscle mass is a prerequisite for the development of novel therapeutics to ameliorate muscle-wasting disorders. Myogenin is a bHLH transcription factor essential for skeletal muscle development (Hasty et al., 1993Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

However, it has not been possible to address the potential involvement of myogenin in neurogenic atrophy because myogenin null mice die at birth due to failure in skeletal muscle differentiation (Hasty et al., 1993Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H.

Histone acetylation has been implicated in denervation-dependent changes in skeletal muscle gene expression, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors block the expression of myogenin in response to denervation (Tang and Goldman, 2006Tang H. Goldman D. Activity-dependent gene regulation in skeletal muscle is mediated by a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-Dach2-myogenin signal transduction cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2008; 20: 1120-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential involvement of myogenin, HDAC4, and HDAC5 in neurogenic atrophy, we performed denervation experiments in mutant mice in which these transcriptional regulators were deleted in adult skeletal muscle. We show that adult mice lacking myogenin fail to upregulate the E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and atrogin-1 following denervation and are resistant to neurogenic atrophy. We demonstrate that myogenin binds and activates the promoter regions of the MuRF1 and atrogin-1 genes, in vitro and in vivo. Similar to adult mice lacking myogenin, mice lacking Hdac4 and Hdac5 in skeletal muscle do not upregulate myogenin following denervation and are resistant to muscle atrophy. Conversely, overexpression of myogenin in skeletal muscle is sufficient to upregulate the expression of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 and promote neurogenic atrophy in mice lacking Hdac4 and Hdac5. These findings reveal a key role of myogenin and class IIa HDACs as mediators of neurogenic atrophy and potential therapeutic targets to treat this disorder. To bypass the requirement of myogenin for skeletal muscle development and investigate its functions in muscle of adult mice, we used a conditional myogenin null allele (Knapp et al., 2006Knapp J.R. Davie J.K. Myer A. Meadows E. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Loss of myogenin in postnatal life leads to normal skeletal muscle but reduced body size.Development. 2006; 133: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which could be deleted in adult muscle with a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase transgene (Hayashi and McMahon, 2002Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Efficient recombination in diverse tissues by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre: a tool for temporally regulated gene activation/inactivation in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, Knapp et al., 2006Knapp J.R. Davie J.K. Myer A. Meadows E. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Loss of myogenin in postnatal life leads to normal skeletal muscle but reduced body size.Development. 2006; 133: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen was administered to mice at 2 months of age, and 89% deletion of the conditional myogenin allele occurred as measured by PCR genotyping from genomic DNA 1 week after tamoxifen injection (see Figure S1 available online). Hereafter, we refer to these mice with deletion of myogenin during adulthood as Myog−/− mice. To examine the role of myogenin in denervated skeletal muscle, the sciatic nerve was severed one month following tamoxifen administration, and muscle atrophy was assessed 14 days later by weighing denervated and contralateral tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Wild-type (WT) denervated TA showed approximately a 40% decrease in weight following denervation in comparison to the contralateral TA (Figure 1A ). In contrast, denervated TA from Myog−/− mice showed a minimal decrease in muscle weight (∼20%) compared to the contralateral TA (Figure 1A), suggesting that Myog−/− mice were partially resistant to muscle atrophy. Because we deleted myogenin in adult mice, muscle development and growth occurred normally prior to tamoxifen administration. As expected, the muscle weights of the nondenervated contralateral TA in Myog−/− and WT mice were similar (WT TA = 37.82 ± 0.87 mg; Myog−/− TA = 36.27 ± 0.54 mg; t test = 0.19). Comparable resistance to atrophy was observed in the gastrocnemius and plantaris (GP) weight of Myog−/− mice (Figure 1A). Immunostaining for laminin of TA cross-sections clearly delineated a decrease of muscle fiber size in the WT denervated TA in comparison to the contralateral muscle, indicative of muscle atrophy (Figure 1B). In contrast, the decrease in fiber size was less evident in the Myog−/− denervated TA (Figure 1B). Morphometric analysis of TA cross-sections highlighted a significant difference in myofiber size between WT and Myog−/− muscles following denervation, confirming the latter were resistant to muscle atrophy (Figure 1C). As expected, seven days after denervation, MuRF1 and atrogin-1 expression was dramatically upregulated in the GP of denervated WT mice (Figure 1D). Remarkably, this upregulation was significantly reduced in Myog−/− denervated GP (Figure 1D), suggesting that the lack of upregulation of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 in denervated Myog−/− muscles was responsible for resistance to atrophy. Deletion of myogenin mRNA from adult Myog−/− muscle was confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 1D). Of note, expression of MyoD (Myod1), another bHLH myogenic regulatory factor (Davis et al., 1987Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Expression of a single transfected cDNA converts fibroblasts to myoblasts.Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar), was highly upregulated in both the contralateral and denervated GP of the Myog−/− mice, seven days after denervation (Figure 1D). These data show that myogenin does not regulate Myod1 expression following denervation. The dramatic upregulation of Myod1 following denervation of Myog−/− mice, which are resistant to atrophy, also argues against a major role of Myod1 in promoting neurogenic atrophy. Accordingly, Myod1 null mice are not resistant to muscle atrophy following denervation (Jason O'Rourke and E. Olson, unpublished data). Denervation is known to affect skeletal myofiber composition (Herbison et al., 1979Herbison G.J. Jaweed M.M. Ditunno J.F.

Biochem. 2009; 73: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine whether the resistance to muscle atrophy observed in mice lacking myogenin was due to differences in fiber type composition, we performed fiber type analysis of soleus muscles 2 weeks after denervation. Our findings revealed no difference in fiber type composition between WT and Myog−/− mice (Figure S2). These findings suggest that myogenin, which is upregulated following denervation, is required for maximal induction of E3 ubiquitin ligase genes and neurogenic atrophy. We next tested whether myogenin was necessary for mediating other forms of atrophy, such as occurs in response to fasting. As shown in Figure 1E, the GP muscles of WT and Myog−/− mice displayed comparable loss in mass following a 48 hr fast. We observed the upregulation of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 upon fasting in both WT and Myog−/− mice and validated the deletion of myogenin in Myog−/− mice (Figure 1F). These data clearly demonstrate that myogenin is not required for starvation atrophy, but rather is a specific mediator of neurogenic atrophy. Because upregulation of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 was impaired in Myog−/− mice, we analyzed the promoter regions of the MuRF1 and atrogin-1 genes for E boxes (CANNTG) that might confer sensitivity to myogenin. Indeed, three E boxes are located in the promoter of the MuRF1 gene, E1 (−143 bp), E2 (−66 bp), and E3 (−44 bp), and one conserved E box is located 79 bp upstream of the atrogin-1 gene (Figure S3A ). The E boxes upstream of MuRF1 are contained in a genomic region near the binding site for FoxO transcription factors (Waddell et al., 2008Waddell D.S. Baehr L.M. van den Brandt J. Johnsen S.A. Reichardt H.M. Furlow J.D. Bodine S.C. The glucocorticoid receptor and FOXO1 synergistically activate the skeletal muscle atrophy-associated MuRF1 gene.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295: E785-E797Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), but several kilobases away from a region shown to be regulated by NFκB (Cai et al., 2004Cai D. Frantz J.D. Tawa Jr., N.E. Melendez P.A. Oh B.C. Lidov H.G. Hasselgren P.O. Frontera W.R. Lee J. Glass D.J. et al.IKKbeta/NF-kappaB activation causes severe muscle wasting in mice.Cell. 2004; 119: 285-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The E box upstream of atrogin-1 is embedded in a region containing multiple FoxO-binding sites (Sandri et al., 2004Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Foxo transcription factors induce the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1 and cause skeletal muscle atrophy.Cell. 2004; 117: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). To confirm the binding of myogenin to the MuRF1 and atrogin-1 promoters, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using differentiated C2C12 myotubes, as Myogenin expression correlates with MuRF1 and atrogin-1 expression during muscle cell differentiation (Figure S3B) (Spencer et al., 2000Spencer J.A. Eliazer S. Ilaria Jr., R.L. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Regulation of microtubule dynamics and myogenic differentiation by MURF, a striated muscle RING-finger protein.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 771-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After six days of differentiation, chromatin from C2C12 myotubes was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against myogenin or immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a control. Using primers flanking the E boxes in the MuRF1 and atrogin-1 promoters, DNA was amplified by PCR (Figure 2A and Figure S3C). Clear enrichment of the corresponding promoter sequences in the DNA immunoprecipitated with antibodies against myogenin compared to IgG was indicative of myogenin binding to the endogenous MuRF1 and atrogin-1 promoters. We validated in vivo binding of myogenin to the endogenous MuRF1 and atrogin-1 promoters by performing ChIP assays using sonicated chromatin extracts from TA muscles harvested from mice at 3 days and 7 days after denervation (Figure 2B and Figure S3D). Direct binding of myogenin as a heterodimer with E12 proteins to the E boxes E2 and E3 in the MuRF1 promoter and to the E box in the atrogin-1 promoter was shown by gel mobility shift assays (Figure S3E). We further tested the ability of myogenin to activate the MuRF1 and atrogin-1 promoter regions in vitro by constructing luciferase reporter plasmids containing the 600 bp genomic DNA fragment upstream of the MuRF1 gene (MuRF1-Luc) or 712 bp upstream of the atrogin-1 gene (atrogin-1-Luc) upstream of a luciferase reporter. Mutant versions of these promoter regions were generated by mutating the myogenin-binding sites in the promoters. By transfecting C2C12 cells, activation of luciferase was detected in response to myogenin using the wild-type promoters (Figure 2C). This activation was blunted by mutation of the E boxes in the promoters (Figure 2C), indicating that the MuRF1 and atrogin-1 promoter regions contain responsive myogenin-binding sites. Similar results were obtained in transfected COS1 cells (Figure S3F). To test the responsiveness of the E3 ligase gene promoters to atrophic signals in vivo, transgenic mice were generated harboring the same upstream regions of the genes ligated to a lacZ reporter (Kothary et al., 1989Kothary R. Clapoff S. Darling S. Perry M.D. Moran L.A. Rossant J. Inducible expression of an hsp68-lacZ hybrid gene in transgenic mice.Development. 1989; 105: 707-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2009Williams A.H. Valdez G. Moresi V. Qi X.

MicroRNA-206 delays ALS progression and promotes regeneration of neuromuscular synapses in mice.Science. 2009; 326: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with the mutated versions of these promoter regions were also generated (MuRF1-Emut-lacZ and atrogin-1-Emut-lacZ). Seven days following denervation, β-galactosidase expression controlled by the wild-type promoters was upregulated in denervated GP muscle fibers compared to the innervated contralateral leg muscles (Figure 2D). The expression of lacZ in only a subset of myofibers likely reflects the mosaicism of F0 transgenic mice and, perhaps, variable upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase genes in different myofibers in response to denervation (Moriscot et al., 2010Moriscot A.S. Baptista I.L. Bogomolovas J. Witt C. Hirner S. Granzier H. Labeit S. MuRF1 is a muscle fiber-type II associated factor and together with MuRF2 regulates type-II fiber trophicity and maintenance.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast to the obvious upregulation of the wild-type transgenes following denervation, mutation of the E boxes in these promoters abrogated β-galactosidase expression, revealing an essential role for myogenin in denervation-dependent activation of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 in vivo (Figure 2D). These results show that the MuRF1 and atrogin-1 genes are targets of myogenin transcriptional activation in response to denervation. Previous studies showed that the class II HDACs, HDAC4 and HDAC5, are upregulated in skeletal muscle in response to denervation (Bodine et al., 2001Bodine S.C. Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K.

In light of the role of myogenin in promoting muscle atrophy, we hypothesized that mice lacking HDAC4 or HDAC5 in skeletal muscle would be resistant to atrophy following denervation owing to a block of Myogenin expression via Dach2. Mice with global deletion of Hdac4 display lethal bone abnormalities (Vega et al., 2004Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M.

Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The absence of HDAC4 protein upon Hdac4 gene deletion was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure S4).

We identified an inflammation-activated signaling in muscle stem (satellite) cells, by which the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) represses Pax7 expression during muscle regeneration. TNF-activated p38α kinase promotes the interaction between YY1 and PRC2, via threonine 372 phosphorylation of EZH2, the enzymatic subunit of the complex, leading to the formation of repressive chromatin on Pax7 promoter. TNF-α antibodies stimulate satellite cell proliferation in regenerating muscles of dystrophic or normal mice. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the enzymatic components of the p38/PRC2 signaling--p38α and EZH2--invariably promote Pax7 expression and expansion of satellite cells that retain their differentiation potential upon signaling resumption. Genetic knockdown of Pax7 impaired satellite cell proliferation in response to p38 inhibition, thereby establishing the biological link between p38/PRC2 signaling to Pax7 and satellite cell decision to proliferate or differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W2017629702,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates antibody gene diversification by creating U:G mismatches. However, AID is not specific for antibody genes; Off-target lesions can activate oncogenes or cause chromosome translocations. Despite its importance in these transactions little is known about how AID finds its targets. We performed an shRNA screen to identify factors required for class switch recombination (CSR) of antibody loci. We found that Spt5, a factor associated with stalled RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and single stranded DNA (ssDNA), is required for CSR. Spt5 interacts with AID, it facilitates association between AID and Pol II, and AID recruitment to its Ig and non-Ig targets. ChIP-seq experiments reveal that Spt5 colocalizes with AID and stalled Pol II. Further, Spt5 accumulation at sites of Pol II stalling is predictive of AID-induced mutation. We propose that AID is targeted to sites of Pol II stalling in part via its association with Spt5."
https://openalex.org/W2071277698,"The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix have an important role in cell growth and differentiation. However, it is unclear as to what extent cancer cells respond to changes in the mechanical properties (rigidity/stiffness) of the microenvironment and how this response varies among cancer cell lines.In this study we used a recently developed 96-well plate system that arrays extracellular matrix-conjugated polyacrylamide gels that increase in stiffness by at least 50-fold across the plate. This plate was used to determine how changes in the rigidity of the extracellular matrix modulate the biological properties of tumor cells. The cell lines tested fall into one of two categories based on their proliferation on substrates of differing stiffness: ""rigidity dependent"" (those which show an increase in cell growth as extracellular rigidity is increased), and ""rigidity independent"" (those which grow equally on both soft and stiff substrates). Cells which grew poorly on soft gels also showed decreased spreading and migration under these conditions. More importantly, seeding the cell lines into the lungs of nude mice revealed that the ability of cells to grow on soft gels in vitro correlated with their ability to grow in a soft tissue environment in vivo. The lung carcinoma line A549 responded to culture on soft gels by expressing the differentiated epithelial marker E-cadherin and decreasing the expression of the mesenchymal transcription factor Slug.These observations suggest that the mechanical properties of the matrix environment play a significant role in regulating the proliferation and the morphological properties of cancer cells. Further, the multiwell format of the soft-plate assay is a useful and effective adjunct to established 3-dimensional cell culture models."

Changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) trigger events critical for tumorigenesis, such as cellular motility, proliferation, and apoptosis. We show that an isoform of Secretory Pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase, SPCA2, is upregulated in breast cancer-derived cells and human breast tumors, and suppression of SPCA2 attenuates basal Ca(2+) levels and tumorigenicity. Contrary to its conventional role in Golgi Ca(2+) sequestration, expression of SPCA2 increased Ca(2+) influx by a mechanism dependent on the store-operated Ca(2+) channel Orai1. Unexpectedly, SPCA2-Orai1 signaling was independent of ER Ca(2+) stores or STIM1 and STIM2 sensors and uncoupled from Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of SPCA2. Binding of the SPCA2 amino terminus to Orai1 enabled access of its carboxyl terminus to Orai1 and activation of Ca(2+) influx. Our findings reveal a signaling pathway in which the Orai1-SPCA2 complex elicits constitutive store-independent Ca(2+) signaling that promotes tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2123245071,"CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is essential to acute skeletal muscle injury repair. We studied the subpopulation of inflammatory cells recruited via CCR2 signaling and their cellular functions with respect to muscle regeneration. Mobilization of monocytes/macrophages (MOs/MPs), but not lymphocytes or neutrophils, was impaired from bone marrow to blood and from blood to injured muscle in Ccr2–/– mice. While the Ly-6C+ but not the Ly-6C~ subset of MOs/MPs was significantly reduced in blood, both subsets were drastically reduced in injured muscle of Ccr2–/– mice. Expression of insulin-like growth fac-tor-1 (IGF-I) was markedly up-regulated in injured muscle of wild-type but not Ccr2–/– mice. IGF-I was strongly expressed by macrophages within injured muscle, more prominently by the Ly-6C~ subset. A single injection of IGF-I, but not PBS, into injured muscle to replace IGF-I remarkably improved muscle regeneration in Ccr2–/– mice. CCR2 was not detected in myo-genic cells or capillary endothelial cells in injured muscle to suggest its direct involvement in muscle regeneration or angiogenesis. We conclude that CCR2 is essential to acute skeletal muscle injury repair primarily by recruiting Ly-6C+ MOs/MPs. Within injured muscle, these cells conduct phagocytosis, contribute to accumulation of intramuscular Ly-6C~ macrophages, and produce a high level of IGF-I to promote muscle regeneration.—Lu, H., Huang, D., Saederupm, N., Charo, I.

Under stress conditions, the conserved protein Maf1 rapidly represses Pol III transcription. We report the crystal structure of Maf1 and cryo-electron microscopic structures of Pol III, an active Pol III-DNA-RNA complex, and a repressive Pol III-Maf1 complex. Binding of DNA and RNA causes ordering of the Pol III-specific subcomplex C82/34/31 that is required for transcription initiation. Maf1 binds the Pol III clamp and rearranges C82/34/31 at the rim of the active center cleft. This impairs recruitment of Pol III to a complex of promoter DNA with the initiation factors Brf1 and TBP and thus prevents closed complex formation. Maf1 does however not impair binding of a DNA-RNA scaffold and RNA synthesis. These results explain how Maf1 specifically represses transcription initiation from Pol III promoters and indicate that Maf1 also prevents reinitiation by binding Pol III during transcription elongation."

Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), whereas it is also located in mitochondria (26Darios F. Corti O. Lücking C.B. Hampe C. Muriel M.P. Abbas N. Gu W.J. Hirsch E.C. Rooney T. Ruberg M. Brice A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It regulates mitochondrial morphology by the PINK/Parkin pathway (27Poole A.C. Thomas R.E.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1638-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and is involved in mitochondria biogenesis in proliferating cells (28Kuroda Y. Mitsui T. Kunishige M. Shono M. Akaike M. Azuma H. Matsumoto T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that parkin promotes mitophagy by its recruitment to impaired mitochondria (29Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which parkin functions in mitochondria or its substrates that are associated with mitochondria is still not clear. Here, we identity the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, as a novel substrate for parkin. Parkin increases the amount of Bcl-2 by mediating its mono-ubiquitination to enhance its stability. Overexpression of parkin decreases, whereas knockdown of parkin increases, LC3 conversion under normal conditions or starvation treatment. Moreover, overexpression of parkin increases the binding of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1. This study reveals that parkin is involved in the regulation of autophagy via mono-ubiquitinating Bcl-2. For creating constructs expressing FLAG-parkin and EGFP-parkin, we cut out the full-length parkin cDNA at BamHI/SalI sites from pGEX-5x-1-parkin and subcloned this fragment into p3×FLAG-myc-CMV-24 vector (Sigma) or pEGFP-C2 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). The deletion mutants of parkin were generated by PCR with different primers using pGEX-5X-1-parkin as the template. pGEX-5X-1-parkin (N terminus, amino acids 1–219) was created by subcloning the PCR product, amplified with primers 5′-CGGGATCCATATGATAGTGTTTGTCAGG-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAGTCAGAGGTGGGGTGTGC-3′, into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences); pGEX-5X-1-parkin (C terminus, amino acids 220–465), with primers 5′-CGGGATCCATAAGGAAACACCAGTAGTC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACCTACACGTCGAACCAGTG-3′; pGEX-5X-1-parkin (R1, amino acids 220–318), with primers 5′-CGGGATCCATAAGGAAACACCAGTAGCT-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAATACTGCTGGTACCGGTTGTA-3′; and pGEX-5X-1-parkin (R2, amino acids 385–465), with primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAACAACTACTCAGGCCTA-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACCTACACGTCGAACCAGTG-3′, respectively. For creating constructs expressing EGFP-parkin-N terminus, EGFP-parkin-C terminus, EGFP-parkin-R1, and EGFP-parkin-R2, we cut out these deletion mutant parkin cDNAs at BamHI/SalI sites from pGEX-5X-1-parkin-N terminus, pGEX-5X-1-parkin-C terminus, pGEX-5X-1-parkin-R1, and pGEX-5X-1-parkin-R2 and then subcloned these fragments into pEGFP-C2 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). Mutants of parkin (K161N, T240R, C431F, and P437L) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a MutantBEST kit (Takara), with primers 5′-TCTCAGGGTACAGTGCAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCCCGGCTGCACTCTTT-3′ for K161N; 5′-GGTGCACAGACGTCAGG-3′ and 5′-TAATGCAAGTGATGTTCCGAC-3′ for T240R; 5′-TCATGCACATGAAGTGTCCGCAG-3′ and 5′-AGCCTCCATTTTTTTCCACTGG-3′ for C431F; and 5′-TGCAGCCCCAGTGCAGGCTCGAGTGG-3′ and 5′-GACACTTCATGTGCATGCAGCCTCC-3′ for P437L, respectively. Full-length Bcl-2 cDNA was first amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGECTCAGAGCAAC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTCATTTCCGACTGAAG-3′ from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech). The PCR product was then inserted into pET-21a (Novagen) or pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) vectors via EcoRI/SalI sites. For GST pulldown assays, an aliquot containing 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was incubated with 20 μg of protein from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli cell lysates containing GST or GST-parkin or GST-Bcl-xl for 30 min on ice. After washing with 1× PBS for three times to remove unbound materials, the beads were incubated with 50 μg of protein from the supernatants of E. coli crude extract containing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl or Bax, which was expressed by pET-21a-Bcl-2, pET-21a-Bcl-xl, or pET-21a-Bax in 0.25 ml of HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed seven times with 1 ml of 1× HNTG buffer. The proteins were eluted with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. 293 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, or HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect the cells with expressing plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the transfected cells were observed using an inverted system microscope IX71 (Olympus) or harvested for immunoblot or immunoprecipitation analyses. Dissociated HF cultures were prepared from postnatal 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The cells were gently dissociated with a plastic pipette after digestion with 0.5% trypsin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were plated at a final density of 5 × 105/cm2 on polyethyleneimine-coated six-well plates (Corning) and cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 1×B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 3 μg/ml glutamine (Sigma). Three days after culture, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine and uridine were added to a final concentration of 10 μm (Sigma) to repress the growth of glial cells. Polyclonal antisera against parkin were raised by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with purified GST-parkin protein as an antigen. Double-stranded oligonucleotides targeting human parkin as described elsewhere (30Mortiboys H. Thomas K.J. Koopman W.J. Klaffke S. Abou-Sleiman P. Olpin S. Wood N.W. Willems P.H. Smeitink J.A. Cookson M.R. Bandmann O. Ann. Neurol. 2008; 64: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides targeting 5′-AACATCGCCCTGTGGATGACT-3′ of human Bcl-2 mRNA, or targeting 5′-TGCAAGGAAGCATACCAT-3′ of rat parkin mRNA were synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma (Shanghai, China), and an irrelevant oligonucleotide served as a negative control. The transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) were mixed in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow the complex formation. Then the cells were washed with Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen), and the mixtures were added. Twelve hours after transfection, the culture medium was replaced by fresh complete medium. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, followed by further analysis. The proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The following primary antibodies were used. Monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Abcam. Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody was from Chemicon. Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal anti-HA, anti-P62, and anti-parkin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-LC3 antibody was from Novus. Polyclonal anti-Beclin 1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The secondary antibodies, sheep anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody, were from Amersham Biosciences. The proteins were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To reprobe the membrane for another primary antibody, the membrane was first incubated with stripping buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm SDS) for 30 min at 50 °C. Then the membrane was subjected to immunoblot analysis following the standard protocol. 293 cells co-expressing FLAG-parkin along with EGFP or EGFP-Bcl-2 were collected 48 h after transfection and sonicated in TSPI buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, protein G-Sepharose was used for precipitation. The beads were washed with TSPI buffer six times and then eluted with SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Eighteen hours after transfection, 293 cells co-expressing FLAG-parkin along with EGFP or EGFP-Bcl-2 were treated with 100 μm cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) to inhibit protein synthesis. The cells were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 h after CHX treatment. The same volume of lysates was analyzed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz). HeLa cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-parkin were cultured in 6-well plates and labeled for 24 h at 37 °C with 65 μm concentrations of unlabeled leucine and 3H-labeled leucine (1 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then washed and incubated in medium containing excess cold leucine (2 mm) for 24 h to allow for degradation of short-lived proteins. These labeled cells were then incubated at 37 °C with either Essential Medium with Earle's Balanced Salts (Hyclone) or DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At 2, 4, and 6 h after starvation, 0.5 ml of the medium were taken out from each sample and mixed with 56 μl of 100% TCA. The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The acid soluble radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were washed with PBS, and 1 ml of cold 10% TCA was added to fix the cellular proteins. The fixed cell monolayers were washed with 10% TCA and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH at 37 °C. The radioactivity in each aliquot of 1 n NaOH was counted by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of long-lived protein degradation at each time point was determined by the formula: % degradation = (3H counts at time point/sum of 3H counts at each time point + total cell-associated radioactivity) × 100. Because parkin is partially localized to mitochondria and is functionally associated with mitochondria (26Darios F. Corti O. Lücking C.B. Hampe C. Muriel M.P. Abbas N. Gu W.J. Hirsch E.C. Rooney T. Ruberg M. Brice A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 28Kuroda Y. Mitsui T. Kunishige M. Shono M. Akaike M. Azuma H. Matsumoto T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 29Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar), we questioned whether parkin interacts with Bcl-2 or its related proteins. To test this possibility, we performed GST pulldown assays to evaluate the binding of parkin with Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, or Bax using GST-parkin, which was coupled to glutathione-agarose beads to pull down Bcl-2 or Bcl-xl or Bax expressed by E. coli transformed with pET-21a-Bcl-2 or pET-21a-Bcl-xl or pET-21a-Bax. GST-parkin, but not GST alone, pulled down Bcl-2 (Fig. 1A) and Bcl-xl (Fig. 1B). However, it failed to pull down Bax (supplemental Fig. S1). To further confirm the interactions between parkin and Bcl-2, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using 293 cells expressing a combination of FLAG-parkin and EGFP-Bcl-2 or EGFP. FLAG-parkin was co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-Bcl-2 using anti-GFP antibody but was not with EGFP (Fig. 1C). In similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Bcl-xl failed to be co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-parkin (data not shown). These data suggest that parkin may interact only with Bcl-2, but not Bcl-xl, in mammalian cells, although parkin interacts with both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl using recombinant proteins expressed by E. coli. To further examine the interactions between parkin and Bcl-2, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using mouse brain lysates with anti-parkin polyclonal antisera. Endogenous Bcl-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous parkin (Fig. 1D). To further determine which domain(s) of parkin are responsible for its interaction with Bcl-2, we generated different deletion mutants of parkin (Fig. 1E) and examined their interactions with Bcl-2 using GST pulldown assays. Our results showed that the full-length parkin, both the RING1 (R1) and RING2 (R2) domains and the C terminus containing two RINGs and an in-between-ring domain, pulled down Bcl-2, whereas the N terminus did not (Fig. 1E). Then we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using 293 cells expressing a combination of FLAG-Bcl-2 and EGFP-parkin or its deletion mutants or EGFP. Our results showed that only full-length parkin and its RING1 domain interacted with Bcl-2, whereas the RING2 domain only had a very weak binding with Bcl-2 in cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that RING domains, at least RING1, is important for their interactions. Because parkin is a well known E3 ligase (9Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar) and we have shown that parkin interacts with Bcl-2, we questioned whether Bcl-2 is a substrate of parkin. First, we transfected 293 cells with EGFP or EGFP-parkin and examined the endogenous Bcl-2 levels using immunoblot analysis. In the presence of parkin, the endogenous Bcl-2 level was increased (Fig. 2A). Next, we co-transfected 293 cells with a combination of FLAG-parkin, EGFP-Bcl-2, and HA-ubiquitin and then performed immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays to examine ubiquitination of Bcl-2. In the immunoprecipitants, a molecular mass corresponding to EGFP-Bcl-2 with one ubiquitin was detected much more strongly in the presence of parkin than in the absence of it using anti-GFP and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2B, right two panels), suggesting that parkin mono-ubiquitinates Bcl-2. Because mono-ubiquitination is a nondegradation signal for the substrates, we performed CHX chase assays to test whether parkin-mediated mono-ubiquitination of Bcl-2 could change its turnover. 293 cells co-expressing EGFP-Bcl-2 and FLAG or FLAG-parkin were treated with CHX at 48 h post-transfection to inhibit new protein syntheses. The total cell lysates were collected at different time points over the following 16 h and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP, anti-FLAG, or anti-GAPDH antibodies. Bcl-2 was much more stable in the presence of parkin than in the absence of it (Fig. 2C). However, the K161N mutant failed to stabilize Bcl-2 (supplemental Fig. S2). We have shown that parkin stabilizes Bcl-2, which is reported to be an inhibitory factor of autophagy (31Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). We questioned whether parkin regulates autophagy and whether its effects on autophagy are related with Bcl-2 levels. 293 cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-parkin were untreated (control) or treated with HBSS for 1 h (starvation). The autophagy protein LC3 is a widely used marker of mammalian autophagy (32Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar), and the abundance of LC3-II or LC3-II/LC3-I ratio corresponds with the level of autophagosome formation (32Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar, 33Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). In the presence of parkin, the endogenous Bcl-2 level was increased, and the LC3 conversion was decreased under normal conditions or starvation treatment (Fig. 3A), suggesting that parkin induces parallel changes with an increase of Bcl-2 and a decrease of autophagy activation. Beclin 1, an ATG gene product essential for autophagy (34Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar), however, was not changed upon multiple treatments (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the proteolysis rate of long-lived proteins in HeLa cells expressing EGFP-parkin was significantly decreased during normal conditions and starvation (Fig. 3B). It was reported that parkin could mediate the engulfment of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes after CCCP treatment (29Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the effects of parkin on autophagy under normal conditions, starvation, and CCCP treatment. In 293 cells expressing EGFP-parkin, LC3-II level was decreased under normal conditions and starvation treatment; however, it was increased upon CCCP treatment (Fig. 4A). Parkin is recruited to mitochondria to induce autophagy under CCCP treatment (29Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Because autophagy is decreased under normal conditions or starvation but increased under CCCP treatment, we examined the subcellular localization of EGFP-parkin in HeLa cells under normal conditions, starvation, and CCCP treatment. EGFP-parkin was predominately located in the cytosol under normal conditions and starvation treatment but apparently translocated to the mitochondria after CCCP treatment (Fig. 4B). Parkin is a protein-ubiquitin E3 ligase (9Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar), and the deficiency of its E3 ligase activity is associated with PD (3West A.B. Maidment N.T. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); we questioned whether the effects of parkin on autophagy and Bcl-2 are mediated by its E3 ligase function. To address this question, we created a FLAG-tagged disease-associated mutant of parkin (K161N), which selectively impaired its E3 ligase activity (35Abbas N. Lücking C.B. Ricard S. Dürr A. Bonifati V. De Michele G. Bouley S. Vaughan J.R. Gasser T. Marconi R. Broussolle E. Brefel-Courbon C. Harhangi B.S. Oostra B.A. Fabrizio E. Böhme G.A. Pradier L. Wood N.W. Filla A. Meco G. Denefle P.

The cells transfected with FLAG, FLAG-parkin (WT), or FLAG-parkin (K161N) were divided into two groups, in which one was without any treatment and another was treated with HBSS for 1 h (starvation). In both groups, parkin decreased LC3 conversion and increased Bcl-2 levels; however, the K161N mutant had no effects (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the E3 ligase activity is essential for parkin to regulate autophagy and Bcl-2. We next co-transfected 293 cells with EGFP-Bcl-2 and HA-ubiquitin, together with FLAG-parkin or the K161N mutant. The cells were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation assays using anti-GFP antibody. In the presence of parkin, a molecular mass correspondi"

This Essay explores the notion that specialized cells have unique vulnerabilities to environmental contingencies that microRNAs help to counteract. Given the ease with which new microRNAs evolve, they may serve as ideal facilitators for the emergence of new cell types. Invariant laws of nature impact the general forms and functions of organisms; they set the channels in which organic design must evolve. But the channels are so broad relative to the details that fascinate us! The physical channels do not specify arthropods, annelids, mollusks, and vertebrates, but, at most, bilaterally symmetrical organisms based upon repeated parts … When we set our focus upon the level of detail that regulates most common questions about the history of life, contingency dominates and the predictability of general form recedes to an irrelevant background… Stephen Jay Gould, Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History. Penguin Books, 1989. (pp. 289–290). Much is puzzling about microRNAs (miRNAs). They are highly accurate markers of cell identity; their profiles unambiguously distinguish among cellular phenotypes, including embryonic stem cells, a vast variety of precursor cells, terminally differentiated cells, and tumor types, even among closely related cancers (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7734) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in surveying many miRNA profiling studies, the expression differences among certain miRNAs in various cell types are often orders-of-magnitude in contrast to the low variation of most miRNAs following environmental influences that do not change cell identity. Although there is a strong correlation between cell identity and patterns of miRNA expression, this does not mean that there are strong phenotypic effects when an individual miRNA is suppressed or knocked out. In fact the effects of miRNAs on protein levels are generally modest (Guo et al., 2010Guo H. Ingolia N.T. Weissman J.S. Bartel D.P. Nature. 2010; 466: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (2861) Google Scholar), and short-circuiting nearly all miRNA biogenesis by inactivating Dicer can have surprisingly modest effects on differentiation and patterning; however, contrary experiments have also been reported (reviewed in Fineberg et al., 2009Fineberg S.K.

Although many miRNAs are highly conserved, some over the entire period of bilaterian evolution, other miRNAs are only found along a single evolutionary branch, indicating the ease with which new miRNAs are invented (Kosik, 2009Kosik K.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, among the puzzling features of miRNAs are the overall increase in their variety as a function of evolutionary time, the lack of conservation of some targets, and the poorly understood relationship between targets and phenotypes. The perspective put forth here is that miRNAs serve as a reservoir to assist cells in coping with environmental contingencies. For instance, cells may at times face short-term oxygen deprivation, but a cell that is more dependent on aerobic respiration will require its own adaptive response. If miRNAs are available for environmental contingencies, then their response must be honed for the needs of specific cell types. Evolutionary change begins with mutations—not specialized cells. The ease of miRNA invention suggests that new miRNAs will create conditions for expanding cell diversity because the presence of a specific miRNA may offset vulnerabilities of specialized cells to environmental contingencies. The complete list of constituent molecules within a cell—its transcripts, proteins, lipids, metabolites, and a host of other molecules—occupy a parameter space within a range of values, which define the “cell state.” As markers of cell identity, miRNAs encode a representation of multiple cell states that all correspond to a single identity. That is, many different states comprise a single identity because cells must retain their identities in the face of both environmental changes and internal noise that can result in large variations in molecular composition. Presumably, protein levels in cells fall within certain boundaries below which there is an insufficient amount of the protein to achieve function and above which toxicity emerges. miRNAs are good candidates for setting boundary conditions upon coding transcripts to restrict protein levels within a range of values that maintain cell identity in the face of homeostatic compensatory changes. Thus, miRNAs have properties, which can hierarchically link the many parameter settings of the cell state to a phenotypic singularity known as cell identity. Cells undergoing developmental or malignant transformation reset their boundary conditions across a specified collective threshold of multiple parameters, which define a new identity. Shifting the miRNA profile during development or relaxing controls over onco-miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs are associated with morphing a cell toward a new identity (Figure 1). Changes in cell identity usually occur in the context of mitosis during stem cell differentiation, reprogramming, oncogenesis, metaplasia, or pathological response to injury. Usually controls over the cell cycle are closely linked to the emergence of a new identity, a point most recently confirmed in several studies that enhance the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells by modulating cell-cycle regulators p53, p21, and p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) (reviewed in Puzio-Kuter and Levine, 2009Puzio-Kuter A.M. Levine A.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 914-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reverse and forward arrows of change in cell identity are not symmetric. Reprogramming a somatic cell to a stem cell is a rare event but potentially possible in any cell. On the other hand, pluripotency is easily lost. Beyond a defined set of growth factors required for sustaining stem cells, pluripotency exists as a state of “freedom” from other extrinsic factors (Silva and Smith, 2008Silva J. Smith A. Cell. 2008; 132: 532-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) that promote differentiation. To maintain pluripotency, the cell must minimize not only the effects of extrinsic signals but also intrinsically random fluctuations that can initiate unintended differentiation. The intermediate states through which cells travel to reach new identities are lined with traps. The concept of steering between these danger zones is called “canalization” and was introduced by C.H. Waddington, and it has been proposed that miRNAs guide a cell past epigenetic traps toward its phenotype in the face of environmental variation (Hornstein and Shomron, 2006Hornstein E. Shomron N. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: S20-S24Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although chromatin organization may account for the height of the barriers to identity changes (Chi and Bernstein, 2009Chi A.S. Bernstein B.E. Science. 2009; 323: 220-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), relatively subtle balances in the constituents of a protein complex accompany differentiation. An example of this shift mediated by miRNAs occurs in vertebrate nervous system development. The development of the vertebrate nervous system provides an example of the influence of miRNAs over epigenetic factors. As precursor cells lose multipotency, a subunit switch occurs in the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, which mediates ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (Yoo et al., 2009Yoo A.S. Staahl B.T. Chen L. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2009; 460: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). During development, the BAF53a and BAF45a subunits within the neural-progenitor-specific complexes swap out in favor of the homologous BAF53b and BAF45b subunits to form neuron-specific complexes found in postmitotic neurons. miR-9∗ and miR-124 mediate this dynamic shift in subunit composition by binding to sequences in the 3′ untranslated region of BAF53a mRNA, repressing protein expression, and presumably changing the kinetic balance of subunits that drive complex assembly. The control elements over gene expression and the networks that link them are often discussed in terms of their role in sharpening the output and making the system robust. Because miRNAs target multiple mRNAs, they can exert distributed control over broad target fields of functionally related mRNAs as opposed to focusing their control on a small number of genes in a “final common pathway.” These networks are often specialized for specific cell types. For example, miR-21 regulates diverse mRNAs that collectively control apoptosis and proliferation, and the dysregulation of miR-21 is associated with many types of cancer (Papagiannakopoulos et al., 2008Papagiannakopoulos T. Shapiro A. Kosik K.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8164-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). miRNAs, including nonhomologous miRNAs, are often physically clustered in the genome, and these sets of miRNAs may target mRNAs with related biological functions at short distances in their protein-protein interaction map (Kim et al., 2009Kim Y.K. Yu J. Han T.S. Park S.Y. Namkoong B. Kim D.H. Hur K. Yoo M.W. Lee H.J. Yang H.K. Kim V.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1672-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The mouse miRNA cluster, mmu-mir-183-96-182, targets Irs1, Rasa1, and Grb2, all of which are located in the insulin-signaling pathway, and these miRNAs coordinate the control of this signal transduction process (Xu and Wong, 2008Xu J. Wong C. RNA. 2008; 14: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The wide variation in the glucose needs of cells suggests that the specific workings of this pathway probably differ among cell types. These specific examples have been generalized to show that coordinated miRNA targeting of closely connected genes is prevalent across pathways (Tsang et al., 2010Tsang J.S. Ebert M.S. van Oudenaarden A. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 140-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Target capture by an miRNA depends on the expression level of the miRNA, the levels of all the target mRNAs, including pseudogene decoy targets (Poliseno et al., 2010Poliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2010; 465: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar), and the affinities between them. Thus the network effects of miRNAs can only be interpreted in a particular cell if the copy numbers of all mRNA targets are known. Small changes within an miRNA/mRNA target network may broaden random variation around a threshold and, as described for the intestinal specification network in C. elegans (Raj et al., 2010Raj A. Rifkin S.A. Andersen E. van Oudenaarden A. Nature. 2010; 463: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), give rise to a variable ON/OFF expression pattern of a “master” regulatory gene within a population of cells. Disrupting a network in this manner thus leads to cell population variation and has the potential to expand the phenotypic repertoire of an organism's cells. miRNAs often operate in feedforward and feedback loops. Genome-scale mapping in C. elegans has revealed 23 such loops within the transcription circuitry (Martinez et al., 2008Martinez N.J. Ow M.C. Barrasa M.I. Hammell M. Sequerra R. Doucette-Stamm L. Roth F.P. Ambros V.R. Walhout A.J. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2535-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) including a miRNA/transcription feedback loop that sets up left-right asymmetry (Johnston et al., 2005Johnston Jr., R.J. Chang S. Etchberger J.F. Ortiz C.O. Hobert O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 12449-12454Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The mediation of pluripotency exit by miR-145 operates as a double-negative feedback loop with the transcription factor Oct4 (Xu et al., 2009Xu N. Papagiannakopoulos T. Pan G. Thomson J.A. Kosik K.S. Cell. 2009; 137: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The operation of this loop may generate bistability through which the cell reaches a single identity unless it crosses a barrier at which point it inevitably transitions to an alternative identity. Identity transitions via bistable states achieve discrete identities and avoid intermediate states. miR-145 continues to operate in differentiation at further stages of mesoderm development in regulating smooth muscle cell fate (Cordes et al., 2009Cordes K.R. Sheehy N.T. White M.P. Berry E.C. Morton S.U. Muth A.N. Lee T.H. Miano J.M. Ivey K.N. Srivastava D. Nature. 2009; 460: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Interestingly, miR-145 in smooth muscle cells maintains its functional vector toward differentiation but switches some targets through which it acts. Whether degraded or maintained as a stable duplex the miRNA is consumed, and thus its action is distinct from the catalytic effects of many protein regulators of gene expression. Thus the two limbs of the transcriptional feedback loops operate quite differently: transcription factors regulate transcription of the primary miRNA and miRNAs stoichiometrically regulate the translation of the mRNA that encodes the transcription factor. Wu and colleagues (Wu et al., 2009Wu C.I. Shen Y. Tang T. Genome Res. 2009; 19: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have proposed that miRNAs keep the system close to the mean and set expression boundaries of transcription factors, which are otherwise noisy. The mean number of copies of different proteins in a cell might have a set point, which lies at different distances from the level of toxicity. When the range of protein levels in a cell fluctuates far from the point of toxicity, the fluctuation is better tolerated and miRNA regulation becomes extraneous. Only the extremes of protein copy number variation within an infrequently occurring long tail jeopardize the cell. However, if the mean copy number of the protein is close to the point of toxicity—and indeed, optimal function may require that the protein set point is close to the toxic level—then tight regulation is necessary, and this might be achieved by miRNAs. In this context, a modest effect of miRNAs on protein levels (Guo et al., 2010Guo H. Ingolia N.T. Weissman J.S. Bartel D.P. Nature. 2010; 466: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (2861) Google Scholar) will be highly significant. PTEN appears to be an example of a gene under exquisitely fine regulation—it is targeted by numerous miRNAs—and fine changes in its dosage are critical to its cancer-forming potential (Alimonti et al., 2010Alimonti A. Carracedo A. Clohessy J.G. Trotman L.C. Nardella C. Egia A. Salmena L. Sampieri K. Haveman W.J. Brogi E. et al.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Information on the turnover of miRNAs is just emerging. Often the pairing of the prokaryotic small RNAs with a target mRNA exposes both molecules to rapid degradation (Masse et al., 2003Masse E. Escorcia F.E. Gottesman S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2374-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Some miRNA/mRNA duplexes appear to be highly stable as long as the identity of the cell is stable. On the other hand, in neurons (and perhaps other specialized settings will show similar phenomena), miRNA turnover is rapid. For example, the miR-183/96/182 cluster, miR-204, and miR-211 decay rapidly during dark adaptation and are transcriptionally upregulated in light-adapted retinas (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Busskamp V. Markiewicz I. Stadler M.B. Ribi S. Richter J. Duebel J. Bicker S. Fehling H.J. Schübeler D. et al.Cell. 2010; 141: 618-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Indeed, the specialized requirements of neurons, particularly with regard to plasticity, may utilize the miRNA system for regulation at a faster timescale than in other cells. When a small number of mRNAs are locally activated, the RISC through its component protein, MOV10 (also known as Armitage in Drosophila and SDE3 in Arabidopsis thaliana), can derepress otherwise silenced local translation (Banerjee et al., 2009Banerjee S. Neveu P. Kosik K.S. Neuron. 2009; 64: 871-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The adaptation of miRNAs for rapid local regulation contributes to fundamental neuronal properties such as control over local translation at the synapse and hence has facilitated cell specialization. The RISC allows both the constitutive maintenance of cell identity by silencing mRNAs that are not part of the specialized cell's repertoire as well as the holding of mRNAs of an alternative identity in reserve (Lim et al., 2005Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3784) Google Scholar), perhaps for less frequent contingencies. Maintaining a large pool of stable miRNA/mRNA duplexes rather than triggering duplex degradation at the moment of binding allows an entire control layer to lie poised for the rapid release of a networked set of mRNAs to undergo translation and achieve a smooth and coordinated identity transition. Like apoptosis, in which the cell systematically destroys itself in a highly controlled sequence of events to prevent triggering inflammatory reactions, changes in cell identity require an orderly transition so that residua from a parental cell do not create toxic interactions with an emerging daughter cell while sustaining cell function during the transition. The mapping of an miRNA profile onto cell identity—a many onto one mapping—corresponds to a phenotypic singularity within the repertoire of all possible cellular identities that the organism is capable of producing. How the miRNA profile undergoes the sweeping coordinated changes associated with a new cell identity is poorly understood. Is there a global disassembly of RISCs and loss of pre-existing miRNAs while new miRNA transcription ramps up to fill RISCs or induce their assembly with a distinct set of miRNAs? XRN is a candidate for mediating this transition. In C. elegans, active turnover is mediated by the 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease XRN-2 to modulate activity of the mature miRNA (Chatterjee and Grosshans, 2009Chatterjee S. Grosshans H. Nature. 2009; 461: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and XRN is necessary for regeneration in planarian (Rouhana et al., 2010Rouhana L. Shibata N. Agata K. Dev. Biol. 2010; 341: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Heuristically, an entry point to this issue is cell transition states. Because nature is so effective in establishing discrete identities for cells, such states are not always easy to observe. Developmentally, cells have two strategies by which they can morph into another cell type. These strategies are distinguished by “mitosis required” or “mitosis optional” properties. The mitosis required option utilizes precursors that travel through stages that progressively narrow the potential of the cell within a lineage tree until a terminal identity is achieved. Reaching a terminal identity requires passage through each discrete precursor in a Waddington landscape. Progression toward terminal differentiation through a set of precursors can scale the number of cells produced to the morphology of the organism and position them correctly. For example, the kinetics of neuron generation in the development of the mouse cerebral cortex can be modeled by determining the proportion of neuroepithelial cells that exit versus re-enter the cell cycle over the 6 day neuronogenetic interval of 11 cell cycles (Caviness et al., 2003Caviness Jr., V.S. Goto T. Tarui T. Takahashi T. Bhide P.G. Nowakowski R.S. Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, neuroectodermal cells have a single fate decision at the time of cell division: differentiate into neuroblasts, which specify neural fate through their progeny, the ganglion mother cells, or specify epidermal differentiation (Doe, 2008Doe C.Q. Development. 2008; 135: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the case of reprogramming one can reverse the arrow of differentiation; however, mitosis remains a requirement for successful reprogramming. The many control points over mitosis operate within a complex circuitry that includes multiple miRNAs as is apparent in many studies that implicate miRNAs in cancer. Changes in cell identity also occur without cell division or very limited cell division through transition states without discrete precursors. For example, when zebrafish endothelial cells egress from the aortic ventral wall they become hematopoietic stem cells (Kissa and Herbomel, 2010Kissa K. Herbomel P. Nature. 2010; 464: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Direct conversion of cells has been achieved repeatedly in the laboratory: the transcription factor CEBP can convert B lymphocytes to macrophages (Xie et al., 2004Xie H. Ye M. Feng R. Graf T. Cell. 2004; 117: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), Math1 can reprogram inner ear support cells to hair cells (Izumikawa et al., 2005Izumikawa M. Minoda R. Kawamoto K. Abrashkin K.A. Swiderski D.L. Dolan D.F. Brough D.E. Raphael Y. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and MyoD, a transcription factor that specifies the skeletal muscle lineage, can convert cultured embryonic fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and retinal epithelial cells into contracting muscle cells (Vierbuchen et al., 2010Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). A method known as direct reprogramming or lineage reprogramming introduces sets of transcription factors into differentiated cells that determine the identity of the reprogrammed cell. Three factors—Ascl1, Brn2 (also called Pou3f2), and Myt1l—are sufficient to convert fibroblasts into neurons (Zhou et al., 2008Zhou Q. Brown J. Kanarek A. Rajagopal J. Melton D.A. Nature. 2008; 455: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). In addition to in vitro approaches, pancreatic exocrine cells have been converted to beta-cells in vivo by the addition of three factors, Ngn3, Pdx1, and Mafa (Lessard et al., 2007Lessard J. Wu J.I. Ranish J.A. Wan M. Winslow M.M. Staahl B.T. Wu H. Aebersold R. Graef I.A. Crabtree G.R. Neuron. 2007; 55: 201-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Changes in cell identity are closely linked to transcription factors, and therefore, within the many feedback loops involving miRNAs, transcription factors have a “dominant” role. Oncogenic changes in cell identity are also dominated by transcription factors that operate in feedback or feedforward loops with miRNAs. For example, activation of the c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor induces Lin-28 and Lin-28B, which negatively regulate let-7 biogenesis by preventing both Drosha- and Dicer-mediated let-7 processing (Chang et al., 2009Chang T.C. Zeitels L.R. Hwang H.W. Chivukula R.R. Wentzel E.A. Dews M. Jung J. Gao P. Dang C.V. Beer M.A. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3384-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, a Myc-Lin-28B-let-7 regulatory circuit appears to reinforce Myc-mediated oncogenesis. The Lin-28-let-7 core circuitry also operates in a positive feedback loop through NF-κB, which activates Lin-28 to create a link between inflammation and cell transformation (Iliopoulos et al., 2009Iliopoulos D. Hirsch H.A. Struhl K. Cell. 2009; 139: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). The two strategies for increasing the variety of specialized cells during development have important differences. Lineage reprogramming may reduce the dangers of the mitotic state with its risk of cancer and directly preserve the epigenetic marks of the starting cell type. But without expansion in cell number, growth of the organism is restricted. Importantly, growth of the organism is not strictly a matter of size; in the case of the brain, for example, massively parallel neuronal networks confer emergent properties to the organism including sapience. The widespread developmental strategy of utilizing precursor pools as discrete cellular intermediates toward the genesis of a mature organism requires the establishment of a series of precursor cell identities along a path of progressively narrowing potential until the cell reaches a terminal identity. The ability of miRNAs to capacitate cellular phenotypy permits the emergence of large numbers of precursor cell types capable of honing developmental processes toward highly specialized identities and precise cell numbers. Many of the puzzling features of miRNAs could be explained if they adapt cells to environmental contingencies. The environment that cells face is many times more complex than the biological adaptations available within the genome. Among the adaptive responses of cells to an environmental contingency is the up- or downregulation of proteins. The properties of miRNAs to adjust protein levels, their dispensability under basal conditions, their conservation, as well as the ease with which new miRNAs appear over evolutionary time all suggest that they are suited for environmental contingencies. Among the many contingencies organisms face is famine. The response to limited glucose is mediated by insulin, which lies in a pathway that is highly interconnected to miRNAs (Xu and Wong, 2008Xu J. Wong C. RNA. 2008; 14: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One developmental response to limited glucose at the organismal level is a reduction in body size, and in Drosophila this adaptation appears to be mediated by miR-8 and its target USH (u-shaped) (Hyun et al., 2009Hyun S. Lee J.H. Jin H. Nam J. Namkoong B. Lee G. Chung J. Kim V.N. Cell. 2009; 139: 1096-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Flies lacking miR-8 are both defective in insulin signaling in the fat body (the counterpart of liver and adipose tissue) and smaller in size. In humans, a miR-8 homolog, miR-200, and a USH homolog, FOG2, mediate the same pathway. Another example is the response of the heart to stress and hypothyroidism through expression of the cardiac-specific miR-208 (van Rooij et al., 2007van Rooij E. Sutherland L.B. Qi X. Richardson J.A. Hill J. Olson E.N. Science. 2007; 316: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The miR-143/145 locus nicely illustrates the paradox that specific miRNAs, which are part of a cell's unique profile, do not result in the loss of the cell's identity when knocked out, but they do impair the cell under certain contingencies. miR-143/145 knockout mice have impaired neointima formation in response to vascular injury and have reduced vascular tone (Xin et al., 2009Xin M. Small E.M. Sutherland L.B. Qi X. McAnally J. Plato C.F. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2166-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Hornstein and Shomron, 2006Hornstein E. Shomron N. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: S20-S24Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar point to the example of miR-1 in D. melanogaster in the context of a discussion on canalization. miR-1 is a highly conserved muscle-specific miRNA that does not affect muscle differentiation in D. melanogaster when knocked out. The phenotype only emerges during a rapid growth phase (Sokol and Ambros, 2005Sokol N.S. Ambros V. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2343-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This example also makes the point that different cells require different responses to the same environmental contingency. In this case, rapid growth in muscle requires different regulatory circuits than rapid growth in other cell types. Cells adapted to an environmental event retain a genetic memory of the event. When the frequency of an environmental contingency falls below a certain level, the selection pressure on the adaptive response is diminished. However, genetic memory is extended by weakly embedding the miRNA contingency response within a genetic circuitry (that is, a network in which a single miRNA targets multiple mRNAs to tune a complex function). Whereas purifying selection operates on the miRNA's role in the genetic circuitry, the miRNA remains in the absence of the contingency and is available to facilitate variation (Kirschner and Gerhart, 2005Kirschner M. Gerhart J.C. The Plausibility of Life. Yale University Press, London2005Google Scholar). miRNAs, as part of modular networks, can potentially speed evolutionary processes and facilitate novelty (Parter et al., 2008Parter M. Kashtan N. Alon U. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: e1000206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Given the very different cell responses to the same contingency, one can pose the “chicken and egg” question. Did specialized cells give rise to miRNA diversification or did miRNAs permit cell specialization? Although framing of the question as an either/or belies the complexity of the answer, miRNAs have many properties that are consistent with a role in fostering cell specialization. Chief among these properties is the ease with which they can be invented through a reservoir of 70 nucleotide hairpin structures in the genome, duplication at different chromosomal loci, and formation of miRNA families with different expression levels. Thus, miRNAs may underlie the vast expansion of specialized cells during early metazoan evolution and support the numerous discrete precursor cell types that have accompanied cell specialization. At the base of the animal kingdom lies the phylum Porifera, a sister group to the animal kingdom with an approximately 650 million year fossil record. The few generic cell types in the largest class of sponge species, the Demosponges, bear little homology to cells found in the rest of the animal kingdom. On the other hand, cnidaria, an extraordinarily diversified phylum whose members, like the sponge, are also derived from two germ layers, has acquired many metazoan cell types including neurons. Thus, the common ancestor of the sponge and all other animals represents a critical evolutionary node when animal phenotypy arose. At this same node, miRNAs characteristic of animals also arose (Christodoulou et al., 2010Christodoulou F. Raible F. Tomer R. Simakov O. Trachana K. Klaus S. Snyman H. Hannon G.J. Bork P. Arendt D. Nature. 2010; 463: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the role of miRNAs in evolution of complex multicellularity may extend beyond animals. Among the eukaryotic groups that evolved complex multicelluarity, miRNAs are also present in red/green algae and brown algae (Cock et al., 2010Cock J.M. Sterck L. Rouzé P. Scornet D. Allen A.E. Amoutzias G. Anthouard V. Artiguenave F. Aury J.M. Badger J.H. et al.Nature. 2010; 465: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The miRNA machinery exists in the Demosponge, Amphimedon queenslandica; however, only eight miRNAs have been detected, none of which bear any orthology to those in bilateria, and the size of both the mature miRNA and its precursor is distinct from other metazoans (Grimson et al., 2008Grimson A. Srivastava M. Fahey B. Woodcroft B.J. Chiang H.R. King N. Degnan B.M. Rokhsar D.S. Bartel D.P. Nature. 2008; 455: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis (starlet sea anemone) possesses a larger repertoire of more conventional miRNA genes, at least one of which is conserved in bilateria (Prochnik et al., 2007Prochnik S.E. Rokhsar D.S. Aboobaker A.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 2007; 217: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The “long fuse” transition to metazoan cell diversity rests upon a core gene set present in the sponge ancestor (Sakarya et al., 2007Sakarya O. Armstrong K.A. Adamska M. Adamski M. Wang I.F. Tidor B. Degnan B.M. Oakley T.H. Kosik K.S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e506Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although sponges lack the phenotypic features of cell types seen in the animal kingdom as well as many of the corresponding subcellular features of animal cells such as synapses and adherens junctions, they do have gene sets that characterize animal cell types, and many of these genes are expressed (Conaco and K.S.K., unpublished data). Poriferan gene sets were exapted (Sakarya et al., 2007Sakarya O. Armstrong K.A. Adamska M. Adamski M. Wang I.F. Tidor B. Degnan B.M. Oakley T.H. Kosik K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2084627980,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP142 is encoded in a large gene cluster involved in metabolism of host cholesterol. CYP142 was expressed and purified as a soluble, low spin P450 hemoprotein. CYP142 binds tightly to cholesterol and its oxidized derivative cholest-4-en-3-one, with extensive shift of the heme iron to the high spin state. High affinity for azole antibiotics was demonstrated, highlighting their therapeutic potential. CYP142 catalyzes either 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol/cholest-4-en-3-one or generates 5-cholestenoic acid/cholest-4-en-3-one-27-oic acid from these substrates by successive sterol oxidations, with the catalytic outcome dependent on the redox partner system used. The CYP142 crystal structure was solved to 1.6 Å, revealing a similar active site organization to the cholesterol-metabolizing M. tuberculosis CYP125, but having a near-identical organization of distal pocket residues to the branched fatty acid oxidizing M. tuberculosis CYP124. The cholesterol oxidizing activity of CYP142 provides an explanation for previous findings that ΔCYP125 strains of Mycobacterium bovis and M. bovis BCG cannot grow on cholesterol, because these strains have a defective CYP142 gene. CYP142 is revealed as a cholesterol 27-oxidase with likely roles in host response modulation and cholesterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2037811991,"The molecular mechanisms involved in the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from differentiated cells are poorly understood. Here we report that caspases 3 and 8, two proteases associated with apoptotic cell death, play critical roles in induction of iPSCs from human fibroblasts. Activation of caspases 3 and 8 occurs soon after transduction of iPSC-inducing transcription factors. Oct-4, a key iPSC transcription factor, is responsible for the activation. Inhibition of caspase 3 or 8 in human fibroblast cells partially or completely (respectively) prevents the induction of iPSCs. Furthermore, retinoblastoma susceptibility (Rb) protein appears to be one of the factors that act downstream of the caspases. We propose that caspases are key facilitators of nuclear reprogramming in iPSC induction."

Broadly, there are two alternative models as follows: either PFN forms pores at the cell membrane through which granzymes are delivered directly or PFN forms pores in endosomes containing granzymes and thereby delivers them to the cytosol (1Pipkin M.E.

PFN is a multidomain protein. The largest portion, including around two-thirds of the molecule starting from the N terminus, is the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain (1Pipkin M.E.

PFN also contains an epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF) of an unknown function and a C2 domain at the C terminus, which is needed for calcium-dependent binding to lipid membranes (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B) (4Uellner R.

The structure of the MACPF domain is strikingly similar to the pore-forming domain of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) protein family from Gram-positive bacteria, and it is therefore believed that both protein families use a similar mechanism for transmembrane pore formation (6Hadders M.A. Beringer D.X.

CDCs are important pathogenicity factors, and prominent members of the family include pneumolysin from Streptococcus pneumoniae, perfringolysin (Clostridium perfringens), streptolysin (S. pneumoniae), and listeriolysin (Listeria monocytogenes) (9Gilbert R.J.

CDCs form pores by inserting a huge β-barrel across the membrane, each monomer contributing two transmembrane β-hairpins that refold from six α-helices within domain 3 (supplemental Fig. 1, C–E) (10Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6199-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).

It has been conclusively shown that CDCs form pores by a two-stage mechanism. First, the protein oligomerizes into a pre-pore state; second, a pore forms (10Tweten R.K. Infect.

There is good evidence that pre-pores and pores can be either complete ring-shaped oligomers or incomplete arc-shaped ones (9Gilbert R.J. Structure. 2005; 13: 1097-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The inner diameter of the PFN pore was determined to be 7–16 nm when measured by the electron microscopy (13Blumenthal R. Millard P.J. Henkart M.P. Reynolds C.W. Henkart P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochim Biophys Acta. 1991; 1063: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the existence of pleomorphic oligomeric states emphasizes that the exact molecular mechanism of PFN pore formation remains poorly understood. To gain insight into the mechanism of PFN pore formation, we have conducted a detailed study using several model membrane systems, clearly showing that native human PFN forms pores of heterogeneous size. The data are consistent with direct insertion of the full ring-shaped pre-pore complex into the lipid bilayer as a pore, as well as the assembly of a transmembrane pore by oligomerization of monomers to an incompletely formed protein channel (an arc) that can form a pore, on membrane insertion, at a protein-lipid interface. The data convincingly show that pore assembly and insertion into the membrane are modulated by the lipid composition of the membrane and that PFN pores have two very distinctive alternative states, either with noisy or noise-free conductance, and with some pores appearing to expand in size while active. We also image two different oligomeric conformations of membrane-bound PFN, which indicate that it can exist in both pre-pore and pore states, validating a CDC-like two-stage mechanism of membrane interaction. Native human PFN was isolated as described by Froelich et al. (22Froelich C.J. Turbov J. Hanna W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cholesterol (CHO), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Rhodamine B 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium salt (rDHPE), and dextrans labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (3 and 10 kDa), rhodamine B (10 kDa), or Oregon Green 488 (70 kDa) were from Invitrogen. Dextrans labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (4, 10, and 70 kDa) were from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma or Merck, unless stated otherwise. GUVs were prepared by electroformation as described (23Peterlin P. Arrigler V. Colloids Surf. 2008; B64: 77-87Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with modifications. The lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) to a final 1 mm concentration. 25 μl of the lipid solution was spread onto a pair of platinum electrodes and dried under reduced pressure for 2 h. Electrodes (dimensions: inner diameter 1 mm, length 34 mm, and spacing between electrodes 4 mm) were then placed into a vial filled with sucrose buffer (295 mm sucrose, 1 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm CaCl2). AC current was applied with a functional generator (GW Instek GFG-3015). The protocol for electroformation was as follows: 2 h of 4 V/10 Hz; 15 min of 2 V/5 Hz; 15 min of 1 V/2.5 Hz; 30 min of 1 V/1 Hz. GUVs were sedimented with the glucose buffer (295 mm glucose, 1 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm CaCl2). The buffer was then exchanged by gentle pipetting with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. GUVs were then divided into aliquots containing approximately equal amounts of vesicles. 6 μl of GUV suspension was mixed with 0.5 or 1 μl of PFN and 0.5 μl of dextran. Final concentrations were 12 nm (PFN), 0.1 mm (D3 and D4), 0.03 mm (D10), or 0.01 mm (D70). Buffer was used for control experiments instead of PFN. The mixture was then incubated at 25 °C monitoring the permeabilization by fluorescent microscopy. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) was performed on AxioImager Z1 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an ApoTome for recording of optical sections (grid-confocal microscopy) and 100-watt HBO mercury arc illumination. FITC-labeled dextrans were observed with 450–490-nm bandpass excitation and 515-nm long pass emission filter. The membranes of the GUV-containing rDHPE were observed with 546/12-nm bandpass excitation and 590-nm long pass emission filter. Kinetics of probe influx were recorded by confocal laser-scanning microscopy on a Leica TCS SP5 laser-scanning microscope, mounted on a Leica DMI 6000 CS inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). An HCX plan apo ×63 (numerical aperture, 1.4) oil immersion objective was used. Probes (D3, D10, or D70) were excited with the 488-nm line of the argon laser. Fluorescence emission was detected at 500–530 nm. The rDHPE in the GUV membranes was excited with the 543-nm line of the argon laser. Fluorescence emission was detected at 605–650 nm. Solvent-free PLM were prepared as described by Dalla Serra and Menestrina (24Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 171-188PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-ml chambers were made of Teflon. The septum between the chambers was made of 25-μm-thick Teflon film and contained a 180-μm hole. PFN was added at 0.2 to 1.1 nm concentrations to stable preformed bilayers on the cis side only (the cis side is where the electrical potential was applied, and the trans side was grounded). All experiments, except selectivity measurements, were performed in symmetric conditions by using a buffer consisting of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, on both sides of the membrane. A constant voltage, generally 40 mV, was applied across the membrane. Miniature magnetic stir bars stirred the solutions on both sides of the membrane. The current across the bilayer was measured, and the conductance (G) was determined as shown in Equation 1, G(nS)=I(pA)/V(mV)(Eq. 1) where I is the current through the membrane, and V is the applied transmembrane potential. Ionic currents were recorded by a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). A PC equipped with a DigiData 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition. The current was filtered at 0.5 kHz and acquired at 2 kHz by the computer using Axioscope 8 software (Axon Instruments). All measurements were performed at room temperature. For the selectivity determination, a three times activity gradient of KCl was formed, whereby the higher concentration was on the trans side. Reversal voltage (Vrev) required to null the transmembrane current was converted into the selectivity index giving the ratio of the permeability of cations over the anions (P+/P−) by the standard Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation 2 (24Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 171-188PubMed Google Scholar), P+/P−=((atrans/acis)⋅exp(eVrev/kT)−1)/((atrans/acis)−exp(eVrev/kT))(Eq. 2) where atrans and acisare the activities of KCl in trans and cis side, respectively. kT/e is ∼25 mV at room temperature. The diameters of PFN pores were calculated according to Equation 3, d(nm)=210((G(nS)1(nm))/(σ(π))(Eq. 3) where d is the pore diameter; σ is the conductivity of the solution (e.g. 11 mS/cm for KCl 0.1 m); l is the length of the pore (estimated to be 20 nm from EM data (16Young J.D. Hengartner H. Podack E.R. Cohn Z.A. Cell. 1986; 44: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and estimate from our cryo-EM data), and G is its conductance. To quantify the noise, we determined the standard deviation of the current on a short time interval (typically ∼10 s) for the individual current trace. Standard deviation was then normalized by dividing it with the average current of each trace to obtain normalized noise. 400 μl of 10 mg/ml DOPC in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 40 μl of 25 mg/ml CHO in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids) were dried on a clean Pyrex tube under argon. Residual chloroform was removed by overnight desiccation in a desiccator attached to a VARIO-SP Diaphragm Pump (Vacuubrand, Germany). The lipid film was then hydrated by addition of 1 ml of liposome buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 250 μm CaCl2, pH 7.4) at 50 °C followed by vigorous vortexing, giving an ∼5 mg/ml lipid dispersion. After 10 freeze-thaw cycles alternating between liquid nitrogen, a 50 °C water bath and a 1-min vortexing step, the dispersion was extruded 11 times with a Mini Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) through a Whatman polycarbonate membrane with a pore diameter of 100 nm. Liposomes were used immediately after preparation. PFN was added to liposomes at a final concentration of 10–20 ng/μl and incubated at either room temperature or 37 °C. If at the latter temperature, then the liposomes and PFN were individually preincubated at 37 °C. Incubation times varied from 5 s to 5 min. The number of pores was accentuated by longer incubations and 37 °C temperature. As a control for the effect of PFN itself, we incubated a mixture of PFN buffer and LUVs at the same ratios used with PFN present. Samples were flash-frozen using liquid ethane on 300 mesh lacey carbon grids and imaged using an FEI F30 FEG cryo-electron microscope operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Images were captured on SO-163 film (Kodak) and scanned using a Zeiss SCAI scanner. Micrographs were corrected for their CTF using CTFFIND3 (25Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) and EMAN (26Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). Images of pores were individually boxed using the EMAN suite program BOXER and subjected to image alignment and analysis using IMAGIC software (27van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Density was visualized using UCSF Chimera (28Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S.

The homology model of perforin was calculated using the PHYRE web server (29Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol.

Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). GUVs were generated by electroformation from DOPC/CHO/rDHPE at a molar ratio 79:20:1. rDHPE was used to mark the membrane. We have found that such a lipid composition enables stable Ca2+-dependent PFN binding as monitored by surface plasmon resonance in a related LUV system (31Praper T. Besenicar M.P. Istinic H. Podlesek Z. Metkar S.S. Froelich C.J. Anderluh G. Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 2492-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The use of fluorescent microscopy enabled us to monitor the movement of fluorescent dextran molecules co-administered with PFN into the GUVs when at least 100 μm Ca2+ was used. In the absence of Ca2+, no permeabilization of GUVs was observed, and spontaneous passage of probes into the GUV in the absence of PFN was negligible (Fig. 1A). The presence of PFN at 12 nm final concentration caused rapid filling of the whole GUV when low molecular weight fluorescent dextrans (Alexa-dextran 3000 (D3) or FITC-dextran 4000 (D4) with hydrodynamic radii of ∼1.4 nm) were in the surrounding medium (Fig. 1A). The filling of each GUV was complete in minutes (Fig. 1B) and indicates transmembrane pore formation. The flux of high molecular weight fluorescent dextrans (Oregon Green- or FITC-labeled dextran 70,000 (D70) with hydrodynamic radii of 6 nm) into GUVs was insignificant even with prolonged incubation for 45 min (Fig. 1, A and C). No further changes in the number of permeabilized GUVs were observed with prolonged incubation for any of the probes tested. The open black circles in Fig. 1C thus represent the final proportion of permeabilized GUVs. The influx of the intermediate probe (Alexa- or FITC-labeled dextran 10,000 (D10) with hydrodynamic radius of ∼1.8 nm) was slower than that of the small probe (Fig. 1B), but nevertheless, approximately half of the vesicles were filled with this probe after 45 min. After that time, we did not observe any further changes in the number of permeabilized GUVs indicating that 45 min is a sufficient time period for formation of functional PFN pores on GUV membranes and for passage of D10 into the interior of permeabilized GUVs. These results clearly show that medium size probes, such as D10, which have a similar size to granzyme B, can also pass through the pores, but the physiological relevance of this direct transfer is questionable because diffusion of such molecules through the pore is relatively slow (Fig. 1, B and C). When both small and intermediate probes were used, we could clearly discriminate vesicles that were filled with either probe or only the small one (Fig. 1D), indicating that some of the pores formed on the GUV membrane were not of sufficient size to allow the passage of the intermediate probe. We independently assessed the single pore sizes of native human PFN by determining the conductance distribution of pores in planar lipid membranes. The existing PLM studies that used cytotoxic granule extracts or isolated PFN indicated that PFN pore formation is dependent on the presence of calcium ions and that pores were heterogeneous in size (20Bashford C.L.

By using homogeneous PFN (22Froelich C.J. Turbov J. Hanna W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), supplemented with Ca2+, we confirmed these findings in DPhPC planar membranes. In the control experiment performed in the absence of Ca2+, we did not observe any PFN activity over a 30-min period (Fig. 2), although the concentration of PFN was ∼10-fold higher than in other experiments where we observed insertion of PFN into PLM (Fig. 3). Soon after addition of 5 mm CaCl2, we observed an increase in conductance in agreement with Ca2+-dependent formation of pores by PFN (Fig. 2, point iii). Pores were usually formed 1–5 min after 0.5 nm PFN addition to a stable bilayer in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3). In the next step, we analyzed PFN pore properties in detail, also focusing on the effect of phosphatidylcholines with mono- (POPC) or di-unsaturated acyl chains (DOPC) and the incorporation of CHO on pore conductance.FIGURE 3PFN pores on PLM composed of various lipids. A, representative conductance traces of at least four independent multichannel experiments are shown for each lipid composition tested. PFN was added to the cis side at 0.5–1.1 nm concentration. Pores started to form 30–300 s after addition of PFN. Two different types of pore openings, gradual (panel i) and discrete (panel ii), are magnified. Individual pores are marked on POPC/CHO 1:1 membrane. B, PFN pores assemble and insert in a gradual or discrete manner. We show the percentage of gradual or discrete openings of PFN pores on PLM composed of DPhPC (86 pores analyzed), DOPC (38 pores), DOPC/CHO 4:1 (24 pores), POPC (37 pores), POPC/CHO 4/:1 (88 pores), and POPC/CHO 1:1 (61 pores). Unshaded regions denote gradual openings and shaded regions discrete openings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The addition of nm PFN to planar lipid bilayers composed of various lipids causes an increase in transmembrane current within 30–300 s (Fig. 3). Within a few minutes after the appearance of the first pore, the total ionic current reached a plateau, which was stable regardless of the polarity of the applied voltage (see below and Fig. 4B). Because PFN readily formed pores in all tested lipid compositions, a preferential lipid requirement was not apparent (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, substantial differences in current traces were noted, consistent with the gradual opening of individual pores as well as well resolved stepwise openings (Fig. 3). Gradual current increases with nonresolved step-like jumps were observed on DPhPC and DOPC membranes and where 20% of CHO was added to DOPC membranes (see Fig. 3, inset i, for the representative trace on DPhPC membrane). Gradual increases of this kind were not seen in similar experiments with CDCs. In these experiments, it was difficult to resolve individual pore apertures, and the pore size estimate was obtained from results of single channel experiments (see below). In contrast, POPC membranes containing various concentrations of CHO enabled stepwise increases in currents, which were very clear at high CHO concentrations. For example, the opening of individual pores could be easily discriminated with a membrane consisting of POPC/CHO, 1:1 (mol/mol) (see Fig. 3, inset ii, for a representative trace). Conductance increments were variable in amplitude, ranging from 0.15 to 21 nS (Fig. 4). The observed distribution of single channel conductances is slightly larger than reported previously (20Bashford C.L. Menestrina G. Henkart P.A. Pasternak C.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3965-3974PubMed Google Scholar). This broad distribution strongly suggests the co-presence of pores, ranging in size from 2 to 22 nm in diameter (as estimated from Equation 3). It appears that larger pores predominated in membranes with lipid compositions that favor opening of discrete pores, i.e. POPC, POPC/CHO (4:1), and POPC/CHO (1:1) membranes lacked pores that displayed conductances <1 nS. On the other hand, smaller pores were frequent on the bilayers composed of DPhPC, DOPC, and DOPC/CHO (4:1). We also noted that PFN pores that assembled on various membranes possessed distinct levels of current noise (Fig. 4). Small pores (G <2 nS) were always associated with high noise and exhibited a generally unstable character. The current traces were often associated with sudden stepwise increases or decreases and sometimes they completely closed (see pores 1 and 2 in Fig. 4A). Larger pores (G >2 nS) possessed slightly lower noise (pores 3 and 4 in Fig. 4A); however, some were associated with a very low noise current trace (pores 5 and 6 in Fig. 4A). These pores possessed conductances between 5 and 14 nS and were stable for up to 1 h. The calculated diameter of such low noise pores was 11–18 nm corresponding to ring-shaped pores observed by electron microscopy (13Blumenthal R. Millard P.J. Henkart M.P. Reynolds C.W. Henkart P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2041344655,"Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) have been identified as a toxin family in most animal venoms with biological functions mainly associated with the ion channel activity of cysteine-rich domain (CRD). CRISPs also bind to Zn2+ at their N-terminal pathogenesis-related (PR-1) domain, but their function remains unknown. Interestingly, similar the Zn2+-binding site exists in all CRISP family, including those identified in a wide range of organisms. Here, we report that the CRISP from Naja atra (natrin) could induce expression of vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules, i.e. intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin, to promote monocytic cell adhesion in a heparan sulfate (HS)- and Zn2+-dependent manner. Using specific inhibitors and small interfering RNAs, the activation mechanisms are shown to involve both mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB. Biophysical characterization of natrin by using fluorescence, circular dichroism, and x-ray crystallographic methods further reveals the presence of two Zn2+-binding sites for natrin. The strong binding site is located near the putative Ser-His-Glu catalytic triad of the N-terminal domain. The weak binding site remains to be characterized, but it may modulate HS binding by enhancing its interaction with long chain HS. Our results strongly suggest that natrin may serve as an inflammatory modulator that could perturb the wound-healing process of the bitten victim by regulating adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells. Our finding uncovers a new aspect of the biological role of CRISP family in immune response and is expected to facilitate future development of new therapeutic strategy for the envenomed victims.

Based on the amino acid sequence homology, the CRISP family can be further classified into four subgroups; the snake venom CRISPs belong to CRISP-3. Human CRISP-3 is expressed in several cells, including B cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils (6Pfisterer P. König H. Hess J. Lipowsky G. Haendler B. Schleuning W.D. Wirth T. Mol. Cell.

The three-dimensional structures of snake CRISPs from several species have been determined by x-ray crystallography to consist of two domains: the N-terminal conserved fold of pathogenesis-related (PR-1) domain and the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD). CRD shares structural similarity with other channel blockers and has been demonstrated to interact with cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, BKca, and/or the calcium release channel/ryanodine receptors (13Wang J.

Structural analysis of PR-1 from the human Golgi-associated plant pathogenesis-related protein suggests that during defense responses, dimerization is the regulatory mechanism through which a catalytic serine protease triad is formed (19Serrano R.L. Kuhn A. Hendricks A. Helms J.B. Sinning I. Groves M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether a similar process could occur in the snake CRISPs as they exist as monomer in solution. However, at least in one case, Zn2+ binding to His-206 of the CRD triggers its motion against PR-1 domain and forms a bridge between the two monomeric CRISPs (20Suzuki N. Yamazaki Y. Brown R.L.

Major symptoms of victims suffered from cobra bite, if survived from the vital action of neurotoxin to acetylcholine receptor, include severe tissue necrosis and edema due to the perturbed proinflammatory and wound-healing process (21Hung D.Z.

Recent advances in studies on the structure and function of cobra venom components have attempted to explain the perturbed wound-healing processes by showing that many non-Arg-Gly-Glu cationic cobra toxins, including cardiotoxins, snake venom matrix metalloprotease, and phospholipase A2, bind strongly to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and/or integrins in the extracellular matrix of cell membranes (23Wu P.L.

We proposed that natrin, a Zn2+-binding CRISP, can bind to heparan sulfate (HS) to modulate pro-inflammatory processes in wound healing by regulating adhesion molecule expression in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). In this study we characterized the structure of natrin in the presence and absence of Zn2+ binding by x-ray diffraction and demonstrated that natrin can induce intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin expressions in ECs through the Zn2+ and HS modulations in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of mechanisms by which the snake CRISP serves as a proinflammatory modulator and suggest that CRISPs may act synergistically with other members of the snake toxin family, such as snake venom matrix metalloprotease and phospholipase A2, to interfere with wound healing and inflammatory processes. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Mouse mAbs against extracellular-signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2; sc-1647), phospho-ERK1/2 (sc-7383), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2; sc-7345), phospho-JNK (sc-6254), and the NF-κB subunit p65 (sc-8008) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against p38 MAPK and mouse mAb against phospho-p38 MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). PD98059, SP600125, and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem. The ERK-, JNK-, and p38-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and control siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals of reagent grade were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The crude venom (15 ml) was collected directly from about 100 Naja atra cobras at a snake farm in Tainan City, Taiwan, and lyophilized before further use. The detailed procedure of purification of natrin was previously described (26Wang Y.L. Goh K.X. Wu W.G. Chen C.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, natrin protein was purified using a three-step chromatography procedure consisting of Sephadex C25, DEAE-Sepharose fast flow, and CM-Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare), with ion-exchange chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (ÄKTA purifier, GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. The natrin was desalted and concentrated (4000 rpm) using Centricon Plus (Millipore, Billerica, MA) centrifugal filter devices. The yield of the protein was ∼5 mg, and the purity was better than 95% as analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and UV-visible spectra. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). ECs were isolated from fresh human umbilical cords by means of the collagenase perfusion technique (27Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar) and grown in Petri dishes in medium 199 (M199, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) for 3 days. Secondary cultures (1–2 × 105 cells/cm2) were used in the experiments. The human monocytic cell line U937 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in culture medium RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Before adhesion experiments, U937 cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% FBS and labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min. The labeled U937 cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were added onto ECs, with subsequent incubation for 30 min. In parallel experiments ECs were pretreated with natrin at various concentrations (50, 100, and 1000 nm) for 6 h. Non-adherent cells were quickly removed by washing with RPMI. The adherent U937 cells on the EC surface were identified and counted in 10 randomly selected microscopic fields (1.37 × 1.07 mm) under an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 m, Zeiss, Germany) with 10× objective (NA = 0.4, LD Achroplan, Zeiss), and adhesion was expressed as cells/mm2. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate/phenochloroform method, and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase system and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified through PCR on a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) using LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPlus SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) with 0.5 m primers of ICAM-1 (sense, 5′-CCTTCCTCACCGTGACTGG-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCGTAGGGTAAGGTTCRRGC-3′; product length, 90 bp), VCAM-1 (sense, 5′-TGGACATAAGAAACTGGAAAAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCACTCATCTCGATTTCTGGA-3′; product length, 78 bp), and E-selectin (sense, 5′-TGGTCTGGCCTGCTACCTAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GTGCTAATGTCAGGAGGGAGA-3′; product length, 100 bp) genes. PCR was performed in triplicate at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 5 s, extension at 72 °C for 8 s, and single signal acquisition for 10 s. The α-tubulin gene expression was used as an internal control (sense, 5′-TTACCTCGACTCTTAGCTTGTCG-3′; antisense, 5′-GGATGGAGATGCACTCACG-3′; product length, 107 bp). The PCR conditions were optimized to obtain a PCR product with a single peak on melting curve analysis on the LightCycler. PCR product was also run on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to obtain a single band of the expected size. Raw data collected from the LightCycler were analyzed using LightCycler Software Version 3.5 (Roche Diagnostics). The adhesion molecule gene expression levels were normalized with α-tubulin gene expression levels in the same sample. ECs were washed with M199, detached with Versene buffer containing EDTA, and centrifuged. Each sample (1 × 106 cells) was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and resuspended in 0.2 ml of PBS containing a mouse mAb against ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or E-selectin (10 µg/ml). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min and washed with PBS to remove the unbound antibody. The ECs were then incubated with anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, West Chester, PA), conjugated with FITC for 30 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 10% FBS. Fluorescein-labeled cells (∼1.0 × 104 cells/sample) were analyzed with the flow cytofluorometer (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Cells incubated with FITC-conjugated antibody alone were used as negative controls. ECs were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture (PMSF, aprotinin, and sodium orthovanadate). The total cell lysate (100 µg of protein) was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% running, 4% stacking) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon P, 0.45-µm pore size). The membrane was then incubated with the designated antibodies. Immunodetection was performed by using the Western Light chemiluminescent detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). ECs were collected by scraping in PBS. After centrifugation of the cell suspension at 2000 rpm, the cell pellets were resuspended in cold buffer A (containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF) for 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.4% and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm to obtain pellets of nuclei. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in cold buffer B (containing 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 400 mm NaCl), vigorously agitated, and then centrifuged. The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was used for the EMSA or stored at −70 °C until used. Double-stranded consensus oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) containing the DNA-binding site for NF-κB were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The extracted nuclear proteins (10 µg) were incubated with 0.1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA for 15 min at room temperature in 25 µl of binding buffer containing 1 µg of poly(dI-dC). In the antibody supershift assay, an antibody against NF-κB subunit p65 (1 µg) was incubated with the mixture for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of the labeled probe. The mixtures were electrophoresed on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and imaged by autoradiography. In some experiments ECs were pretreated with PD98059 (30 µm), SP600125 (20 µm), SB203580 (10 µm), or lactacystin (10 µm) for 1 h or heparinase III (1 units/ml) for 4 h and then stimulated with natrin. For siRNA transfection, the cells at 70–80% confluence were transfected with the designated siRNA at various concentrations (10–40 nm) for 48 h using RNAimax transfection kit (Invitrogen) before stimulation with natrin. The experiments were carried out on a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. For binding analysis, biotinylated heparin was immobilized on streptavidin-coated SPR biosensor chip (SA chip; GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 5 µl/min. The streptavidin-coated surface without immobilized heparin was used as a reference. For competitive studies, natrin (5 µm) preincubated with different GAGs (i.e. heparin, HS, dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin sulfate A and C, keratin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid) and different lengths of heparin (i.e. disaccharide (dp2), tetrasaccharide (dp4), hexasaccharide (dp6), octasaccharide (dp8), decasaccharide (dp10), dodecasaccharide (dp12), and tetradecasaccharide (dp14)) were injected over the heparin surfaces at a flow rate of 40 µl/min. Surfaces were regenerated by injection of 0.02% (w/v) SDS and 1.0 m NaCl. The resulting sensorgrams were fitted using BIAevaluation 3.2 software (GE Healthcare). CD spectra for natrin was recorded on a spectropolarimeter (AVIV 62A DS, Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C as previously described (28Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Vyas K.A. Liu Y.S. Chiang C.M. Chi L.M. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1484-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD spectra were acquired using quartz cells (path length 0.1 cm) at a protein concentration of 10 µm in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 mm ZnCl2. Spectra, averaged from three trials, were obtained on scanning from 260 to 190 nm. For measurements of intrinsic fluorescence intensity of tryptophan from natrin, the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 280 and 340 nm, respectively, on a fluorescence spectrometer (HITACHI F4500, Japan). To determine the dissociation constant (Kd), we performed computer curve-fitting based on the equation Kd = [P][Zn]/[PZn], where [P], [Zn], and [PZn] represent the concentrations of natrin, cation, and natrin/cation complex, respectively. Complete (100%) binding were assumed to occur when the fluorescence intensity reached a plateau. The crystallization of native natrin and data collection were performed as previously reported (26Wang Y.L. Goh K.X. Wu W.G. Chen C.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data to resolution 1.58 Å from a frozen native crystal were collected at 110 K using a detector (Quantum 4R CCD, ADSC) at wavelength 1.0 Å on the Taiwan contract beamline BL12B2 at SPring-8 in Japan. The natrin structure (PDB ID 1XTA) was determined with the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (S-SAD) method. The S-SAD data were collected to resolution 2.6 Å with a long wavelength 1.743 Å at 110 K at the beamline BL17B2 equipped with a detector (Q210 CCD, ADSC) at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The anomalous-difference Patterson map at 3.5 Å showed four disulfide sites that were directed to the program SOLVE 2.06 (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), yielding an initial figure of merit (FOM) of 0.37–3.5 Å resolution; the phases were then improved with a FOM 0.51 using RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Additional two disulfide positions were found in an anomalous difference Fourier map, and eventually six disulfide features were input to SOLVE 2.06 to generate the initial phases with a FOM 0.41 at 3.5 Å, and phases were improved with non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry averaging in RESOLVE with a final FOM 0.71 at 2.6 Å. An initial structure with ∼71% complete model in an asymmetric unit was automatically traced into electron density maps, and the remaining model was manually built with O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). After rigid-body refinement and simulated annealing with CNS (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), several rounds of model building with O and refinement with CNS were performed to improve the quality and completeness of structure. At this stage all data to resolution 1.58 Å were included for further refinement. The refinement then proceeded through several cycles of simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement and, finally, the PICKWATER subroutine from CNS to define peaks in difference maps (3σ cut-off level) to locate 268 water molecules automatically. The refinement converged to a final R-factor value 22.4% (Rfree = 25.1%) for all data at a resolution 1.58 Å. The natrin-zinc complex was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 291 K. 2-µl drops of purified protein (8 mg/ml) in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, were mixed with equal volumes of the reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 8000 and equilibrated against 0.5 ml of reservoir solution in a 24-well ADX plate (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 110 K using the synchrotron radiation on the beamline BL13B at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center. The structure of natrin-zinc complex was determined by molecular replacement as implemented in CCP4 (33Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test for two groups of data and one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate the possible inflammatory effects of natrin on ECs, we first investigated whether natrin could affect the adhesiveness of ECs to U937 monocytic cells. After treating ECs with natrin at concentrations of 50–1000 nm for 6 h followed by incubation with U937 cells for 30 min, we found significant increases in U937 cell adhesion to ECs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). No similar effect on the increased adhesiveness was observed for ECs treated with natrin for 1 h (data not shown). In these experiments ECs treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; 100 units/ml) were used as positive controls. Apparently, natrin did not produce any significant cytotoxicity on ECs, as demonstrated by the results of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) viability assay and microscopic observation of cell morphology (data not shown). These results suggest that natrin could exert proinflammatory effects on ECs without interfering with their viability.

Metabolites from ten diverse varieties of cooked rice were detected using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. A total of 3,097 compounds were detected, of which 25% differed among the ten varieties. Multivariate analyses of the metabolite profiles showed that the chemical diversity among the varieties cluster according to their defined subspecies classifications: indica, japonica, and aus. Metabolite-specific genetic diversity in rice was investigated by analyzing a collection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from biochemical pathways of nutritional importance. Two classes of bioactive compounds, phenolics and vitamin E, contained nonsynonymous SNPs and SNPs in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions for genes in their biosynthesis pathways. Total phenolics and tocopherol concentrations were determined to examine the effect of the genetic diversity among the ten varieties. Per gram of cooked rice, total phenolics ranged from 113.7 to 392.6 µg (gallic acid equivalents), and total tocopherols ranged between 7.2 and 20.9 µg. The variation in the cooked rice metabolome and quantities of bioactive components supports that the SNP-based genetic diversity influenced nutritional components in rice, and that this approach may guide rice improvement strategies for plant and human health."

The development of treatments to increase FXN levels in FRDA requires elucidation of the steps involved in the biogenesis of functional FXN. The FXN mRNA is translated to a precursor polypeptide that is transported to the mitochondrial matrix and processed to at least two forms, FXN42–210 and FXN81–210. Previous reports suggested that FXN42–210 is a transient processing intermediate, whereas FXN81–210 represents the mature protein. However, we find that both FXN42–210 and FXN81–210 are present in control cell lines and tissues at steady-state, and that FXN42–210 is consistently more depleted than FXN81–210 in samples from FRDA patients. Moreover, FXN42–210 and FXN81–210 have strikingly different biochemical properties. A shorter N terminus correlates with monomeric configuration, labile iron binding, and dynamic contacts with components of the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic machinery, i.e. the sulfur donor complex NFS1·ISD11 and the scaffold ISCU. Conversely, a longer N terminus correlates with the ability to oligomerize, store iron, and form stable contacts with NFS1·ISD11 and ISCU. Monomeric FXN81–210 donates Fe2+ for Fe-S cluster assembly on ISCU, whereas oligomeric FXN42–210 donates either Fe2+ or Fe3+. These functionally distinct FXN isoforms seem capable to ensure incremental rates of Fe-S cluster synthesis from different mitochondrial iron pools. We suggest that the levels of both isoforms are relevant to FRDA pathophysiology and that the FXN81–210/FXN42–210 molar ratio should provide a useful parameter to optimize FXN augmentation and replacement therapies.

Plk3 also has a tumor-suppressing activity as aging PLK3-null mice develop tumors in multiple organs. The growth of highly vascularized tumors in PLK3-null mice suggests a role for Plk3 in angiogenesis and cellular responses to hypoxia. By studying primary isogenic murine embryonic fibroblasts, we tested the hypothesis that Plk3 functions as a component in the hypoxia signaling pathway. PLK3(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts contained an enhanced level of HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown analyses revealed that Plk3 physically interacted with HIF-1α under hypoxia. Purified recombinant Plk3, but not a kinase-defective mutant, phosphorylated HIF-1α in vitro, resulting in a major mobility shift. Mass spectrometry identified two unique serine residues that were phosphorylated by Plk3. Moreover, ectopic expression followed by cycloheximide or pulse-chase treatment demonstrated that phospho-mutants exhibited a much longer half-life than the wild-type counterpart, strongly suggesting that Plk3 directly regulates HIF-1α stability in vivo. Combined, our study identifies Plk3 as a new and essential player in the regulation of the hypoxia signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2032388784,"Migrations allow animals to find food resources, rearing habitats, or mates, but often impose considerable predation risk. Several behavioural strategies may reduce this risk, including faster travel speed and taking routes with shorter total distance. Descriptions of the natural range of variation in migration strategies among individuals and populations is necessary before the ecological consequences of such variation can be established.Movements of tagged juvenile coho, steelhead, sockeye, and Chinook salmon were quantified using a large-scale acoustic tracking array in southern British Columbia, Canada. Smolts from 13 watersheds (49 watershed/species/year combinations) were tagged between 2004-2008 and combined into a mixed-effects model analysis of travel speed. During the downstream migration, steelhead were slower on average than other species, possibly related to freshwater residualization. During the migration through the Strait of Georgia, coho were slower than steelhead and sockeye, likely related to some degree of inshore summer residency. Hatchery-reared smolts were slower than wild smolts during the downstream migration, but after ocean entry, average speeds were similar. In small rivers, downstream travel speed increased with body length, but in the larger Fraser River and during the coastal migration, average speed was independent of body length. Smolts leaving rivers located towards the northern end of the Strait of Georgia ecosystem migrated strictly northwards after ocean entry, but those from rivers towards the southern end displayed split-route migration patterns within populations, with some moving southward.Our results reveal a tremendous diversity of behavioural migration strategies used by juvenile salmon, across species, rearing histories, and habitats, as well as within individual populations. During the downstream migration, factors that had strong effects on travel speeds included species, wild or hatchery-rearing history, watershed size and, in smaller rivers, body length. During the coastal migration, travel speeds were only strongly affected by species differences."

Major problems need to be overcome before ex vivo HSC expansion can be used clinically. The use of human umbilical cord blood (CB) as a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transplantation continues to increase, with more than 3000 CB transplants performed annually around the world (Foeken et al., 2010Foeken L.M. Green A. Hurley C.K. Marry E. Wiegand T. Oudshoorn M. Bone Marrow Transplant. 2010; 45: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent growth in CB transplantation has been fuelled by the availability of these cells in banks as well as strong clinical data supporting the use of HLA mismatched transplants with low risk of graft versus-host disease (GVHD) (Hwang et al., 2007Hwang W.Y. Samuel M. Tan D. Koh L.P. Lim W. Linn Y.C. Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007; 13: 444-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, wide utilization of CB is limited by the relatively low number of HSCs per unit, and most CB units have insufficient stem cells for adults. Significant effort has gone into developing technologies for ex vivo expansion of HSCs in order to enable CB transplants for adults, who comprise the majority of patients who need such intervention. Boitano and colleagues recently reported a purine derivative termed SR1 that significantly expands human CB HSCs in culture (Boitano et al., 2010Boitano A.E. Wang J. Romeo R. Bouchez L.C. Parker A.E. Sutton S.E. Walker J.R. Flaveny C.A. Perdew G.H. Denison M.S. et al.Science. 2010; 329: 1345-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The authors screened a chemical library of 100,000 heterocyclic compounds for their ability to expand the numbers of CD34+ CB cells in culture. They showed that SR1 supported a 50-fold increase in CD34+ cells and, more importantly, a 17-fold increase in cells that retain the ability to engraft immunodeficient mice. Strikingly, SR1 is an antagonist of the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor protein (AhR), which normally mediates xenobiotic responses but has also been implicated in regulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Knockdown of the AhR resulted in sustained proliferation of CD34+ cells in culture. This study is significant because it demonstrates that small synthetic chemicals can be used to identify signaling pathways that govern HSC fate decisions and modulate them to allow HSC expansion for clinical use. An important caveat to consider regarding the capacity of SR1 to expand HSCs is that this factor is not effective if added alone to the culture medium. The results presented by Boitano and colleagues were done in a serum-free medium supplemented with four cytokines: thrombopoietin (Tpo), stem cell factor (SCF), Flt3 ligand, and IL-6. Their observed maximal HSC expansion was similar to the 20-fold expansion of human CB HSCs obtained in a serum-free culture medium containing a different growth factor cocktail: SCF, Tpo, FGF-1, Angiopoietin-like 5, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang C.C. Kaba M. Iizuka S. Huynh H. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2008; 111: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Many other factors and cytokines may promote ex vivo HSC expansion, including Notch ligands, Wnts, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins, Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) (Zhang and Lodish, 2008Zhang C.C. Lodish H.F. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2008; 15: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), pleiotrophin (Himburg et al., 2010Himburg H.A. Muramoto G.G. Daher P. Meadows S.K. Russell J.L. Doan P. Chi J.T. Salter A.B. Lento W.E. Reya T. et al.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and prostaglandin E2 (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), but none of these signal activators have been successful when added alone. Because few laboratories have attempted to systematically optimize the combination and concentrations of cytokines and other factors such as SR1, or the time of culture or the O2 tension, it is likely that one can significantly increase the extent of HSC expansion ex vivo. Methods that improve HSC homing and survival after injection of HSCs could also be combined with ex vivo HSC expansion to further enhance the efficiency of transplantation. In any case, in addition to optimizing HSC expansion protocols, many other hurdles remain to be overcome before these important laboratory discoveries can be converted into human therapies. One important example is that CB units are stored frozen, and thawing typically reduces the number of viable nucleated cells by half. Improvements in cryopreservation are essential. Another important point to consider regarding the various protocols that are used to expand CB HSCs is the relative merits of preisolation of a subpopulation of CB cells prior to the culture period. Most of these assays begin with magnetic bead isolation of CD34+ or CD133+ cells. These populations contain most of the hematopoietic progenitors and long-term reconstituting HSCs, which are necessary for a successful clinical graft. Preisolation of CD34+ or CD133+ cells improves cell expansion ex vivo, possibly due to the absence of more mature populations or other nonhematopoietic cells that may inhibit HSC or progenitor proliferation. Working with purified progenitor cell populations would also facilitate eventual gene therapy approaches that require selection of HSCs that have incorporated a transgene into a desired chromosomal location. On the other hand, preisolation of CD34+ or CD133+ cells presents several potential disadvantages, particularly given that many, if not most of the HSCs present in the original unfrozen CB unit may be lost during this fractionation process. Cell loss may in part be due to failure to capture the desired cells, given that positive selection always leads to cell loss due to inefficient binding to the beads, and some HSCs may not express enough CD34 or CD133 on their surface to be selected. There may also be inadvertent cell loss due to stress and eventual death during the various manipulation steps. In the clinical setting, the final number of HSCs and progenitors in the transplant is the essential parameter. Given the likely loss of a substantial number of HSCs prior to manipulation of the CB unit, even the current, improved, degree of HSC expansion that has been achieved may not result in an appreciative net increase in HSC number when compared to unmanipulated CB units. Thus, any isolation process that results in extensive HSC loss should clearly be avoided in order to maximize the number of stem cells transplanted into the patient. In addition to the risk of losing unselected cells, the use of positive selection methods to enrich for HSCs also involves tagging the cells of interest with antibodies, which could affect cell function or activation state. Furthermore, this practice also raises quality-control issues because the antibodies remain attached to the HSCs after transfer to the patient. The cost of sufficient clinical grade antibody used to select greater than 109 cells per CB unit is also a concern, especially because many of the red blood cells that are present will nonspecifically bind the antibody and make the process inefficient. One option to overcome these limitations is to use a negative depletion method to remove non-HSCs, such as lineage positive, differentiated, hematopoietic cells. Negative depletion methods should also minimize the loss of HSCs relative to positive selection, although the degree of enrichment for HSCs in the selected population will be lower. Therefore, given the current clinical situation, expansion of CB cells without positive selection seems most practical and cost-effective. It remains to be seen whether SR1, in combination with other cytokines, can still expand HSCs efficiently from a coarsely purified population of HSCs, or even from unpurified total CB cells. In addition to various combinations of soluble factors, several protocols for HSC expansion involve coculture with mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) lines (Robinson et al., 2006Robinson S.N. Ng J. Niu T. Yang H. McMannis J.D. Karandish S. Kaur I. Fu P. Del Angel M. Messinger R. et al.Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006; 37: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This approach offers several advantages, particularly that preisolation of CD34+ or CD133+ cells does not appear to be required to yield a significant expansion of primitive cells, and that cell viability is retained during the expansion process. Despite these positive features, there is little evidence that MSC coculture supports expansion of long-term reconstituting HSCs, although these conditions do increase the number of hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, challenges in production and quality control of clinical grade MSCs under good manufacturing protocols (GMP) will hinder the therapeutic use of these cocultures, as will the inevitable risks to the patient following inadvertent infusions of the feeder cells, possibly including graft reactions. Besides HSCs, successful grafts must include less primitive hematopoietic progenitors in order to generate mature myeloid and lymphoid cells during the first weeks following transplantation. Immune cells such as T cells in the graft also play a role in the engraftment process. A recent clinical study (Delaney et al., 2010Delaney C. Heimfeld S. Brashem-Stein C. Voorhies H. Manger R.L. Bernstein I.D. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) showed that Notch-mediated ex vivo expansion of human CD34+ CB progenitors resulted in a marked increase in the absolute number of stem/progenitor cells. When infused in myoablated patients, the time to neutrophil recovery was substantially shortened. This finding is clinically important, given that delayed engraftment can result in a higher incidence of infection, which is one of the major causes of mortality after transplantation. Finally, bioprocess and scale-up issues are relevant even if MSC coculture is not required. Milliliter volume cell cultures are very different from multiliter cultures that will be necessary for generating sufficient cell numbers for clinical transplants. Issues concerning absolute sterility and good manufacturing practices are needed for clinical translation (Ährlund-Richter et al., 2009Ährlund-Richter L. De Luca M. Marshak D.R. Munsie M. Veiga A.

https://openalex.org/W2066686326,"Progressive accumulation of DNA damage is causally involved in cellular senescence and organismal aging. The DNA damage kinase ATM plays a central role in maintaining genomic stability. ATM mutations cause the genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia, which is primarily characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cancer susceptibility. Although the importance of ATM function to protect against oxidative DNA damage and during aging is well described, the mechanism of ATM activation by these stimuli is not known. Here we identify ATM interactor (ATMIN) as an essential component of the ATM signaling pathway in response to oxidative stress and aging. Embryos lacking ATMIN (atmin(Δ/Δ)) died in utero and showed increased numbers of cells positive for phosphorylated histone H2aX, indicative of increased DNA damage. atmin(Δ/Δ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts accumulated DNA damage and prematurely entered senescence when cultured at atmospheric oxygen levels (20%), but this defect was rescued by addition of an antioxidant and also by culturing cells at physiological oxygen levels (3%). In response to acute oxidative stress, atmin(Δ/Δ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed slightly lower levels of ATM phosphorylation and reduced ATM substrate phosphorylation. Conditional deletion of ATMIN in the murine nervous system (atmin(ΔN)) resulted in reduced numbers of dopaminergic neurons, as does ATM deficiency. ATM activity was observed in old, but not in young, control mice, but aging-induced ATM signaling was impaired by ATMIN deficiency. Consequently, old atmin(ΔN) mice showed accumulation of DNA damage in the cortex accompanied by gliosis, resulting in increased mortality of aging mutant mice. These results suggest that ATMIN mediates ATM activation by oxidative stress, and thereby ATMIN protects the aging brain by preventing accumulation of DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1969688763,"Opioid receptor signaling via EGF receptor (EGFR) transactivation and ERK/MAPK phosphorylation initiates diverse cellular responses that are cell type-dependent. In astrocytes, multiple μ opioid receptor-mediated mechanisms of ERK activation exist that are temporally distinctive and feature different outcomes. Upon discovering that chronic opiate treatment of rats down-regulates thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) expression in the nucleus accumbens and cortex, we investigated the mechanism of action of this modulation in astrocytes. TSP1 is synthesized in astrocytes and is released into the extracellular matrix where it is known to play a role in synapse formation and neurite outgrowth. Acute morphine (hours) reduced TSP1 levels in astrocytes. Chronic (days) opioids repressed TSP1 gene expression and reduced its protein levels by μ opioid receptor and ERK-dependent mechanisms in astrocytes. Morphine also depleted TSP1 levels stimulated by TGFβ1 and abolished ERK activation induced by this factor. Chronic morphine treatment of astrocyte-neuron co-cultures reduced neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Therefore, inhibitory actions of morphine were detected after both acute and chronic treatments. An acute mechanism of morphine signaling to ERK that entails depletion of TSP1 levels was suggested by inhibition of morphine activation of ERK by a function-blocking TSP1 antibody. This raises the novel possibility that acute morphine uses TSP1 as a source of EGF-like ligands to activate EGFR. Chronic morphine inhibition of TSP1 is reminiscent of the negative effect of μ opioids on EGFR-induced astrocyte proliferation via a phospho-ERK feedback inhibition mechanism. Both of these variations of classical EGFR transactivation may enable opiates to diminish neurite outgrowth and synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2039634808,"Hematopoiesis requires the interaction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with various stromal microenvironments. Here, we examine the role of early B cell factor 2 (Ebf2), a transcription factor expressed in a subset of immature osteoblastic cells. Ebf2(-/-) mice show decreased frequencies of HSCs and lineage-committed progenitors. This defect is cell nonautonomous, as shown by the fact that transplantation of Ebf2-deficient bone marrow into wild-type hosts results in normal hematopoiesis. In coculture experiments, Ebf2(-/-) osteoblastic cells have reduced potential to support short-term proliferation of HSCs. Expression profiling of sorted Ebf2(-/-) osteoblastic cells indicated that several genes implicated in the maintenance of HSCs are downregulated relative to Ebf2(+/-) cells, whereas genes encoding secreted frizzled-related proteins are upregulated. Moreover, wild-type HSCs cocultured with Ebf2(-/-) osteoblastic cells show a reduced Wnt response relative to coculture with Ebf2(+/-) cells. Thus, Ebf2 acts as a transcriptional determinant of an osteoblastic niche that regulates the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitors, in part by modulating Wnt signaling."

A recent report indicated that a TGF-β target gene, TMEPAI (transmembrane prostate androgen-induced RNA), is possibly also a downstream target of Wnt signaling. Although TMEPAI was believed to be involved in tumorigenicity because of its blockage of TGF-β signaling, how TGF-β and Wnt signals affect the activation of the TMEPAI gene is not well understood. Herein, we show that the TMEPAI promoter is regulated synergistically by TGF-β/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) 7L2.

https://openalex.org/W2031955280,"We have previously demonstrated that histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) expression and splicing play an important role in smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation from embryonic stem (ES) cells, but the molecular mechanisms of increased HDAC7 expression during SMC differentiation are currently unknown. In this study, we found that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) induced a 3-fold increase in the transcripts of HDAC7 in differentiating ES cells. Importantly, our data also revealed that PDGF-BB regulated HDAC7 expression not through phosphorylation of HDAC7 but through transcriptional activation. By dissecting its promoters with progressive deletion analysis, we identified the sequence between -343 and -292 bp in the 5'-flanking region of the Hdac7 gene promoter as the minimal PDGF-BB-responsive element, which contains one binding site for the transcription factor, specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Mutation of the Sp1 site within this PDGF-BB-responsive element abolished PDGF-BB-induced HDAC7 activity. PDGF-BB treatment enhanced Sp1 binding to the Hdac7 promoter in differentiated SMCs in vivo as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, we also demonstrated that knockdown of Sp1 abrogated PDGF-BB-induced HDAC7 up-regulation and SMC differentiation gene expression in differentiating ES cells, although enforced expression of Sp1 alone was sufficient to increase the activity of the Hdac7 promoter and expression levels of SMC differentiation genes. Importantly, we further demonstrated that HDAC7 was required for Sp1-induced SMC differentiation of gene expression. Our data suggest that Sp1 plays an important role in the regulation of Hdac7 gene expression in SMC differentiation from ES cells. These findings provide novel molecular insights into the regulation of HDAC7 and enhance our knowledge in SMC differentiation and vessel formation during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2003454835,"Dipetalodipin (DPTL) is an 18 kDa protein cloned from salivary glands of the triatomine Dipetalogaster maxima. DPTL belongs to the lipocalin superfamily and has strong sequence similarity to pallidipin, a salivary inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. DPTL expressed in Escherichia coli was found to inhibit platelet aggregation by collagen, U-46619, or arachidonic acid without affecting aggregation induced by ADP, convulxin, PMA, and ristocetin. An assay based on incubation of DPTL with small molecules (e.g. prostanoids, leukotrienes, lipids, biogenic amines) followed by chromatography, mass spectrometry, and isothermal titration calorimetry showed that DPTL binds with high affinity to carbocyclic TXA(2), TXA(2) mimetic (U-46619), TXB(2), PGH(2) mimetic (U-51605), PGD(2,) PGJ(2), and PGF(2α). It also interacts with 15(S)-HETE, being the first lipocalin described to date to bind to a derivative of 15-lipoxygenase. Binding was not observed to other prostaglandins (e.g. PGE(1), PGE(2), 8-iso-PGF(2α), prostacyclin), leukotrienes (e.g. LTB(4), LTC(4), LTD(4), LTE(4)), HETEs (e.g. 5(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HETE, 20-HETE), lipids (e.g. arachidonic acid, PAF), and biogenic amines (e.g. ADP, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, histamine). Consistent with its binding specificity, DPTL prevents contraction of rat uterus stimulated by PGF(2α) and induces relaxation of aorta previously contracted with U-46619. Moreover, it inhibits angiogenesis mediated by 15(S)-HETE and did not enhance inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation by SQ29548 (TXA(2) antagonist) and indomethacin. A 3-D model for DPTL and pallidipin is presented that indicates the presence of a conserved Arg(39) and Gln(135) in the binding pocket of both lipocalins. Results suggest that DPTL blocks platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and angiogenesis through binding to distinct eicosanoids involved in inflammation."

GPIHBP1 is assumed to be expressed mainly within the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, the sites where most lipolysis occurs, but the tissue pattern of GPIHBP1 expression has never been evaluated systematically. Because GPIHBP1 is found on the luminal face of capillaries, we predicted that it would be possible to define GPIHBP1 expression patterns with radiolabeled GPIHBP1-specific antibodies and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. In Gpihbp1(-/-) mice, GPIHBP1-specific antibodies were cleared slowly from the blood, and PET imaging showed retention of the antibodies in the blood pools (heart and great vessels). In Gpihbp1(+/+) mice, the antibodies were cleared extremely rapidly from the blood and, to our surprise, were taken up mainly by lung and liver. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of GPIHBP1 in the capillary endothelium of both lung and liver. In most tissues with high levels of Gpihbp1 expression, Lpl expression was also high, but the lung was an exception (very high Gpihbp1 expression and extremely low Lpl expression). Despite low Lpl transcript levels, however, LPL protein was readily detectable in the lung, suggesting that some of that LPL originates elsewhere and then is captured by GPIHBP1 in the lung. In support of this concept, lung LPL levels were significantly lower in Gpihbp1(-/-) mice than in Gpihbp1(+/+) mice. In addition, Lpl(-/-) mice expressing human LPL exclusively in muscle contained high levels of human LPL in the lung."

In this study, we found that Hcy interferes with apoE3 dimerization by forming disulfide bonds with cysteine residues of apoE3 and impairs apoE3 ability to generate HDL to a level similar to that of apoE4. This is also the case for human CSF obtained from patients with hyperhomocysteinemia and for brain of apoE3 knock-in mice subcutaneously injected with Hcy. These results suggest that two different risk factors for AD, namely, apoE4 and hyperhomocysteinemia, may share a common mechanism; that is, apoE4 has a lower ability to generate HDL than apoE3 and the Hcy modification of apoE3 impairs the ability of apoE3 to generate HDL to a level similar to that of apoE4.

A synthetic peptide, LGADMEDVCGR or LGADMEDVC(Hcy)GR, or recombinant apoE3 was dissolved in PBS, to a concentration of 1 mm or 15 μm, respectively. Synthetic peptide LGADMEDVCGR or ApoE3 was mixed with or without 10-fold molar concentration of Hcy at 4 °C for 1 day using a vortex mixer. ApoE3 incubated with or without Hcy was digested with trypsin (1 μg/ml; Trypsin Gold, Promega) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at 37 °C overnight. Incubated synthetic peptides or apoE3 tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (model 1100 Series; Agilent Technology, Waldbronn, Germany) on a C18 column (2 × 30 mm; Cadenza CD-C18, Imtakts, Kyoto, Japan) with a linear gradient of 0–64% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA for 64 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The fractionated peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry (AXIMA-CFR, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by MALDI-TOF MS. Samples were prepared by mixing with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Human plasma and CSF were obtained from patients in Fukushimura Hospital (Toyohashi, Japan). The plasma and CSF were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen at lumbar tap and then stored at −80 °C until use. Experiments using human CSF were performed after obtaining informed consent from the patients' guardians for diagnosis and research for biochemical, molecular biological, and genomic analysis. The Hcy concentrations in human plasma and CSF were determined by HPLC as demonstrated previously (24Isobe C. Murata T. Sato C. Terayama Y. Life Sci. 2005; 77: 1836-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The apoE genotype was also determined and the samples from apoEϵ3/3 patients were used for this study. For the determination of apoE3 dimers, the conditioned media or human CSF were dissolved in a sampling buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.01% bromphenol blue and analyzed by 12.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Blots were probed for 4 h at room temperature with a goat anti-apoE polyclonal antibody, AB947 (1: 2,000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Band detection was carried out using an ECL kit (GE Healthcare). The signals corresponding to apoE of each sample in the immunoblot membrane were quantified by densitometry with NIH ImageJ software, with varying concentrations of recombinant apoE protein (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) as standards. Standard signals were demonstrated to be linear in the range of apoE protein amounts from 0 to 2 μg per lane. The apoE concentrations in the conditioned culture media within this range were used for analysis. Mice expressing human apoE3 in place of mouse apoE (apoE3 knock-in mice) (29Hamanaka H. Katoh-Fukui Y. Suzuki K. Kobayashi M. Suzuki R. Motegi Y. Nakahara Y. Takeshita A. Kawai M. Ishiguro K. Yokoyama M. Fujita S.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) at 40–42 weeks of age were subcutaneously injected with Hcy. PBS (100 μl) containing Hcy at a concentration of 13 μmol/μl (0.6 μmol/g body weight) was injected into the mice twice a day (in the morning and evening) for 6 days. For control mice, 100 μl of PBS was injected. In the morning of the seventh day, the animals were deeply anesthetized with isofluorane. Through an incision of the skin covering the occipital bone and the cervical dorsum, the atlanto-occipital membrane was exposed and incised under an operating microscope. The animals were perfused transcardially with PBS, and the brains were removed. Peripheral blood (0.5–1.0 ml) was collected from the caudal vena cava immediately before the perfusion. For the preparation of brain samples, the brain hemispheres from a PBS- or Hcy-injected apoE3 mouse were homogenized in 800 μl of PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was then used for Western blot analysis. StatView computer software (Windows) was used for statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences between samples was evaluated by multiple pairwise comparisons among the sets of data using analysis of variance and the Bonferroni t test. We examined the cholesterol and PC efflux from cultured astrocytes induced by apoE3, apoE3 pretreated with Hcy, and apoE4 24 h after the commencement of treatment of apoEs at various concentrations (Fig. 1A). The levels of cholesterol and PC efflux induced by apoE3 were higher than those induced by apoE3 preincubated with Hcy or apoE4 at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 μm. Because our previous study showed that the dimer formation of apoE3 enhances apoE3 ability to release lipids (6Michikawa M. Fan Q.W. Isobe I. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Minagawa H. Gong J.S. Jung C.G. Watanabe A. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Saito H. Michikawa M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2009; 87: 2498-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we determined the levels of cholesterol and PC efflux and also the assembly state of apoE3 and apoE4. The levels of cholesterol and PC efflux induced by apoE3 were significantly higher than those induced by apoE4 and apoE3 pretreated with Hcy 24 h after the commencement of treatment (Fig. 1B). A reduced level of lipid efflux was accompanied by a reduced level of apoE3 dimers in apoE3 samples pretreated with Hcy (Fig. 1C, asterisks). ApoE4 does not form dimers owing to a lack of cysteine. In these experiments, we confirmed that Hcy at concentrations used in our study was not toxic (see supplemental Fig. 1). These results suggest the possibility that Hcy inhibits the dimer formation of apoE3 and this may be responsible for the reduced level of lipid efflux induced by apoE3 pretreated with Hcy, because our previous studies showed that apoE serves as a lipid acceptor in an isoform-dependent manner; apoE3 induces greater HDL generation than apoE4 (6Michikawa M. Fan Q.W. Isobe I. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 7Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K.

It is possible to assume that the thiol in Hcy can form disulfide bonds with the thiol of cysteine residues in apoE3. To examine whether the inhibition of thiol-disulfide bonds in apoE3 dimers affects apoE3-mediated cholesterol efflux, apoE3 or apoE4 was preincubated with a thiol-reducing agent, DTT, and then dialyzed against PBS and used for the experiment to determine cholesterol efflux. The levels of cholesterol released by apoE3 were significantly greater than those released by apoE3 pretreated with Hcy or DTT at 24 h after the commencement of treatment (Fig. 1D). The level of cholesterol efflux induced by apoE4 was significantly lower than that induced by apoE3, and Hcy or DTT pretreatment did not affect apoE4-induced cholesterol release (Fig. 1D). A reduced level of lipid efflux was accompanied by a reduced level of apoE3 dimers in apoE3 samples pretreated with Hcy or DTT (Fig. 1D). The effects of Hcy and DTT on apoE3 dimer formation are shown in Fig. 1E. The levels of apoE3 dimers (Fig. 1E, asterisks) in apoE3 samples pretreated with Hcy or DTT decreased in a Hcy- or DTT-dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). These lines of evidence suggest that the lower level of HDL generated by Hcy-bound apoE3 than by intact apoE3 results in an earlier Aβ deposition and inferior synaptic plasticity, causing earlier AD development. We next determined whether these are also the cases for neurons. We have examined the cholesterol efflux from cultured neurons induced by apoE3, apoE3 pretreated with Hcy, apoE4, and apoE4 pretreated with Hcy at varying hours after the commencement of treatment of apoEs at 0.3 μm (Fig. 2A). The levels of cholesterol efflux induced by apoE3 were greater than those induced by apoE3 preincubated with Hcy, apoE4, or apoE4 preincubated with Hcy at 24 and 48 h. We also determined the levels of cholesterol efflux 24 h after the commencement of treatment of apoEs at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 μm (Fig. 2B). The levels of cholesterol efflux induced by apoE3 were greater than those induced by apoE3 preincubated with Hcy, apoE4, or apoE4 preincubated with Hcy at apoE concentrations of 0.3 and 1.0 μm. Next, we determined the levels of cholesterol and PC efflux and also the assembly state of apoE3 and apoE4. The levels of cholesterol and PC released by apoE3 were significantly greater than those released by apoE4 and by apoE3 and apoE4 pretreated with Hcy 24 h after the commencement of treatment (Fig. 2C). A reduced level of lipid efflux was accompanied by a reduced level of apoE3 dimers in apoE3 samples pretreated with Hcy (Fig. 2D). ApoE4 does not form dimers, owing to a lack of cysteine and Hcy pretreatment dis not affect the apoE4 assembly state. Regarding the underlying molecular mechanism, we determined whether Hcy and apoE3 form disulfide bonds. We performed reverse-phase HPLC and MS of apoE3-derived peptides, LGADMEDVCGR (residues 104–114) and the Hcy-bound form of LGADMEDVCGR, namely LGADMEDVC(Hcy)GR. The HPLC profiles of the synthetic peptides LGADMEDVCGR and LGADMEDVC(Hcy)GR are shown in Fig. 3A, panels a and b, respectively. We also analyzed LGADMEDVCGR incubated with (Fig. 3A, panel d) or without Hcy (Fig. 3A, panel c) for 24 h at 4 °C. The LGADMEDVCGR peptides incubated with Hcy (peaks 4 and 5) eluted at positions corresponding to those of LGADMEDVCGR (peak 1) and LGADMEDVC(Hcy)GR (peak 2), respectively. Peaks 1–5 shown in Fig. 3A were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. A signal in peak 4 corresponds to the same molecular mass of LGADMEDVC(Hcy)GR (Fig. 3B, 4) as peak 2 (Fig. 3B, 2). A signal in peak 5 corresponds to the same molecular mass of LGADMEDVCGR (Fig. 3B, 5) as peak 1 (Fig. 3B, 1). Signals in peak 3 correspond to LGADMEDVCGR and LGADMEDVCGR dimers (Fig. 3B, 3). Some of the dimers dissociate into monomers by laser irradiation during MS. These data also show that the LGADMEDVCGR peptides tend to form dimers by disulfide bonds in an environment susceptible to oxidation; however, in the presence of Hcy, Hcy inhibited the dimer formation by direct interaction with the thiol of Cys residues. Next, we analyzed the interaction between intact apoE3 and Hcy. The solution containing intact apoE3 was incubated with or without Hcy at 4 °C for 1 day. ApoE3 in the solution was digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides of intact apoE3 incubated with (Fig. 3C, panel e) or without (Fig. 3C, panel d) Hcy were analyzed by HPLC. The level of peak 3 (Fig. 3C, panel e), which has the same elution time as LGADMEDVC(Hcy)GR (Fig. 3C, panel b), increased compared with that of peak 1 (Fig. 3C, panel d), whereas that of peak 4 (Fig. 3C, panel e), which has the same elution time as LGADMEDVCGR (Fig. 3C, panel c), decreased compared with that of peak 2 (Fig. 3C, panel d). Furthermore, peaks 1–4, shown in Fig. 3C, were also analyzed by MS (Fig. 3D). The signals in peak 1 correspond to LGPLVEQGR (residues 181–189) and VEQAVETEPEPELR (residues 2–15) (Fig. 3D, peak 1). The signals in peak 3, which has the same elution time as peak 1, correspond to LGADMEDVC(Hcy)GR, indicating that intact apoE3 binds to Hcy in addition to LGPLVEQGR and VEQAVETEPEPELR (Fig. 3D, peak 3). The signals in peak 2, which has the same elution time as peak 4, correspond to LGADMEDVCGR and LGADMEDVCGR dimer in addition to AYKSELEEQLTPVAEETR (residues 73–90) (Fig. 3D, peak 2). Next, we examined whether the ratio of the apoE3 dimer is lower in the human subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia than in human subjects with normal Hcy. The CSF from human apoEϵ3/3 carriers with normal plasma Hcy and hyperhomocysteinemia were analyzed. The profiles of patients are shown in Table 1. The Hcy concentrations in the plasma and CSF from the patients with hyperhomocysteinemia were higher (mean ± S.E., 232.58 ± 191.91 μm for plasma and 20.17 ± 12.30 nm for CSF, Table 1) than those from the patients with normal plasma Hcy (4.07 ± 0.86 μm for plasma and 0.45 ± 0.16 nm for CSF, Table 1). The results of Western blot analysis of these samples under nonreducing conditions are shown in Fig. 4A. The band signals of apoE3 dimers and monomers were scanned by densitometry, and the ratio of the levels of dimers with respect to the level of total apoE3 was calculated. The ratio of the levels of apoE3 dimers with respect to the level of total apoE3 is significantly lower in those who have hyperhomocysteinemia (Fig. 4B). The CSF samples from the human subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia contain a higher level of Hcy (mean ± S.E. = 20.17 ± 12.30 nm, Table 1) compared with those from the human subjects with normal plasma Hcy (0.45 ± 0.16 nm, Table 1), suggesting that a larger amount of Hcy binds apoE3 molecules via disulfide bonds and inhibits apoE3 dimerization. The correlation between the level of Hcy and the ratio of apoE3 dimer is shown in supplemental Fig. 2. Dimer ratios tended to negatively correlate with Hcy level in CSF and serum samples, although it does not reach statistical significance (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). This tendency for a negative correlation becomes stronger when the separately distributed data (a, b, or c) are removed. The serum lipid profiles of the patients and the correlations of the lipid profiles and the ratio of apoE3 dimer are also shown in supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 3.TABLE 1The profiles of patients examinedNo.AgeSexDiagnosisSerum HcyCSF Hcyμmnm189FCVD50.40.90275FCVD119261.8396FAD45.51.14489FDLB43.856.2571MPSP25.80.40691FCVD38.00.6781MVD3.71.23886FAD5.00.43983FAD1.40.321095FSD-NFT5.70.321184MNPH6.70.201279MDLB1.90.22 Open table in a new tab We next examined whether hyperhomocysteinemia inhibits apoE3 dimer formation in the brains of mice expressing human apoE3 without expressing rodent endogenous apoE. ApoE3 knock-in mice were injected with 100 μl of 0.6 μm Hcy subcutaneously twice a day for 6 days. The mice were then sacrificed, brains and serum were isolated, and the level of the apoE3 dimer in brain samples was determined by Western blot analysis under nonreducing conditions. The level of the apoE3 dimer in each sample that was loaded with equal amounts of brain homogenate protein is shown in Fig. 4, C and D. The Hcy level in the serum from the Hcy-injected mice is significantly higher than those from PBS-injected mice (mean ± S.E. for Hcy-treated samples is 10.26 ± 0.47 μm and that for control is 4.98 ± 0.48 μm; p < 0.0001). The level of the apoE3 dimer is significantly lower in Hcy-injected mouse brains than in control brains (Fig. 4D). Although the ratio of the apoE3 dimer in the mouse brain was very low compared with that of human CSF, these results show that a higher level of serum Hcy resulted in the attenuation of dimer formation of apoE3 in the brain. Our previous studies have shown that intramolecular interaction (i.e. domain interaction) and intermolecular interaction (i.e. dimerization) determine the apoE isoform-dependent ability to generate HDL (7Gong J.S.

Neurosci. Res. 2009; 87: 2498-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because Hcy is a molecule harboring a thiol, we hypothesized that the thiol of Hcy associates with the thiol of cysteine residues in apoE3, and the formation of this disulfide bonds interferes with apoE3 dimerization. In the present study, we found that Hcy binds to cysteine residues of apoE3, thereby interfering with apoE3 dimerization and impairing the ability of apoE3 to generate HDL to a level similar to that of apoE4. These in vitro results are supported by those of the analysis of human CSF samples from patients with hyperhomocysteinemia and normal serum homocysteine, showing that the ratio of the levels of apoE3 dimers with respect to the level of total apoE3 in CSF samples from patients with hyperhomocysteinemia is significantly lower than that from normal controls. In addition, the subcutaneous injection of Hcy into apoE3 knock-in mice resulted in a reduced level of the apoE3 dimer in the brain homogenate, suggesting that hyperhomocysteinemia decreases the level of apoE3 dimer in CSF or the brain. To determine the effect of Hcy bound to apoE3, we preincubated Hcy and apoE3 at relatively high concentrations. Under these conditions, ∼66% of apoE3 binds to Hcy, whereas the level of Hcy bound to apoE4 was not detected (Table 2). One may question whether the inhibitory effect of Hcy on apoE3 dimerization and apoE3-mediated lipid efflux were observed when lower concentrations of Hcy similar to those in serum or CSF were used in the presence of comparable concentrations of apoE3 in culture. Hcy at lower concentrations did not inhibit apoE3 dimerization nor attenuate apoE3-mediated lipid efflux. This may be because it takes a longer time to form disulfide bonds between Hcy and apoE3 at physiological concentrations in culture. However, this is not the case for in vivo conditions, including those in human CSF and the mouse brain. Although the precise mechanism underlying this discrepancy cannot be provided by the current study, the disulfide bonds between apoE3 and Hcy molecules occurs in vivo at concentrations lower than those used in in vitro experiments. In support of this notion, previous studies have shown that >70% of Hcy in plasma forms disulfide-bonded to cysteine residues of proteins including transthyretin (31Lim A. Sengupta S. McComb M.E.

However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which Hcy directly interacts with the molecule(s) in these studies are not fully understood. In this study, we showed that a high level of Hcy impairs apoE3 function to a similar level of apoE4 by preventing/breaking the disulfide bonds, thereby leading to a decreased HDL generation.

Our observations in the present study also provide new insight into concerning the apoE genotype-dependent treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia, especially for reducing the risk of AD.

T lymphocytes can bind to fibronectin, a constituent of lymph nodes, via their β1 integrins, which is a primary mechanism of T lymphocyte migration; however, the signaling pathways involved are unclear. We report that rapid (within 2 min) and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is required for T cell migration on fibronectin in response to CCL21. Conversely, prevention of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by inhibition of its kinase, MAPK/MEK, prevented T lymphocyte migration. Previous studies have suggested that phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) can mediate phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which is required for β1 integrin activation. Paradoxically, we found that inhibition of PLCγ1 phosphorylation by the general PLC inhibitor U73122 was associated with a delayed and reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and reduced migration of T lymphocytes on fibronectin. To further characterize the relationship between ERK1/2 and PLCγ1, we reduced PLCγ1 levels by 85% using shRNA and observed a reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and a significant loss of CCR7-mediated migration of T lymphocytes on fibronectin. In addition, we found that inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by U0126 resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of PLCγ1, suggesting a feedback loop between ERK1/2 and PLCγ1. Overall, these results suggest that the CCR7 signaling pathway leading to T lymphocyte migration on fibronectin is a β1 integrin-dependent pathway involving transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is modulated by PLCγ1.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorPLCγphospholipase Cγ. are responsive to many types of stimuli, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and chemoattractants. Ligand activation of a GPCR leads to a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in an exchange of GDP for GTP in the Gα subunit and dissociation of Gα from the Gβγ subunits. The subunits then initiate downstream signaling events to regulate the activation state of adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C (PLC) (1Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol.

CCR7 (C-C chemokine receptor 7), a G protein-coupled receptor, is expressed on naive T lymphocytes and is required for migration into and within lymph nodes. CCR7 binds to two ligands, CCL19 and CCL21. CCL21 is expressed in high endothelial venules, the entry route into lymph nodes (2Gunn M.D. Tangemann K. Tam C. Cyster J.G. Rosen S.D. Williams L.T. Proc.

Furthermore, PLCγ1 is required for adhesion to fibronectin and is important for β1 integrin-mediated cell migration (8Tvorogov D. Wang X.J. Zent R. Carpenter G. J.

PLCγ1 was recently shown to be phosphorylated in response to CCR7 activation in head and neck cancer cells and was necessary for the migration of squamous cell carcinoma cells (10Wang J. Zhang X.

GPCRs can activate the downstream effector MAPKs to regulate chemotactic migration (11Redondo-Muñoz J. José Terol M. García-Marco J.A. García-Pardo A.

Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 86: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells, CCR7 transient transfectants stimulated with CCL19 rapidly activated ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2), whereas CCL21 had a minimal effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (13Otero C. Eisele P.S. Schaeuble K. Groettrup M. Legler D.F. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In primary B lymphocytes that express endogenous CCR7, CCL21 mediated sustained activation of ERK1/2 for 10 min (11Redondo-Muñoz J. José Terol M. García-Marco J.A. García-Pardo A. Blood. 2008; 111: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These contrasting studies illustrate the importance of determining the role of ERK1/2 in the migration of primary T lymphocytes to CCL21. Therefore, we examined the molecular mechanisms required for β1 integrin activation and β1 integrin-mediated migration. We found that in primary T lymphocytes, CCL21 promotes the activation of PLCγ1 and the transient activation of ERK1/2, which are required for β1 integrin activation in response to CCL21. Loss of activation of either PLCγ1 or transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 prevented migration via β1 integrins to CCL21. These results indicate that CCL21 activation of CCR7 promotes the activation of β1 integrins, leading to migration following phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and ERK1/2. Primary human T lymphocytes were isolated from volunteer donors under an approved protocol in accordance with the policies and procedures of the human subjects protection program at the University of Kansas Medical Center. U0126 (Calbiochem), U73122 and U73343 (Biomol), pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories), human PLCγ1 shRNA (OriGene), and species-specific CCL19 and CCL21 (R&D Systems) were purchased. The 12G10 anti-human activated β1 integrin antibody was generously provided by Dr. Martin Humphries (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), and the MAB1959 function-blocking antibody was purchased (Millipore). Human blood was collected from volunteer donors, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (GE Healthcare). Whole blood was transferred to 50-ml conical tubes and diluted at a 1:1 ratio with PBS + Ca2+/Mg2+ (Cellgro). In a separate 50-ml conical tube, 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque was layered with 35 ml of whole blood/PBS + Ca2+/Mg2+ and centrifuged for 20 min at 100 × g without the brake. The middle layer containing lymphocytes was isolated, washed, and pelleted. T lymphocytes were negatively selected using the EasySep kit (Stemcell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lymphocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone), and 2 nm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for use within 3 days of isolation. All chemotaxis assays were carried out using a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe). Lower wells were loaded with 0 or 10 nm to 2 μm CCL21 in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and were separated from the upper wells containing the lymphocytes using a 5-μm pore nitrocellulose membrane (Neuroprobe) that had been preincubated in either serum-free RPMI 1640 medium or 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma). Primary human T lymphocytes (5 × 105) were allowed to migrate in a humidified, 37 °C, 5% CO2 chamber for 2 h to gradients of CCL21. For β1 integrin function-blocking studies, primary human T lymphocytes were mixed with 10 μg/ml MAB1959 or an isotype control prior to loading in the migration chamber. Following migration, chambers were disassembled, and lymphocytes in the bottom chamber were collected and counted by hemocytometer or fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and then counted using a hemocytometer. In each assay, migration of cells to serum-free RPMI 1640 medium was considered the “0” migration point, and all migration values were normalized to that point. Assays were performed in duplicate and replicated a minimum of three times. Lymphocytes were pretreated in serum-free medium with U0126 (1 μm) for 90 min, U73122 (2 μm) for 20 min, or pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Lymphocytes were then stimulated with 8 nm CCL19 or CCL21 for 0, 2, 5, 7, and 10 min. Lymphocytes were then lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride (Sigma), and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma) for 15 min on ice. Lysates were sheared, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants (5 × 105 cell equivalents per time point) were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated on 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were preincubated in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 0.1% TBS with Tween 20 (TBST), or 5% BSA/TBST (Sigma) and probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-total ERK1/2, anti-total PLCγ1, or anti-phospho-PLCγ1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Primary antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-species-specific IgG (Pierce), and immune complexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Pierce). Membranes were stripped using Blotfresh (SignaGen Laboratories), rinsed in 1× TBST, blocked, and re-probed. Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software. Primary human T lymphocytes were transiently transfected with human PLCγ1 shRNA (OriGene TF302445) or control shRNA (Origene TR30015) using LipoD293 (SignaGen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, PLCγ1 or control (8 μg) shRNAs and LipoD293 were diluted into DMEM. Diluted LipoD293 was added to the diluted shRNA and incubated for 15 min, and the LipoD293-shRNA complexes were added to the lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were incubated with the complexes in complete medium for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 prior to assay. Lymphocytes were treated with U0126 or pertussis toxin or transfected with PLCγ1 shRNA, as described previously. Lymphocytes were unstimulated (0 min) or stimulated (0.5–5 min) with 400 nm CCL19 or CCL21. Following stimulation, lymphocytes were submerged in 1 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS. Lymphocytes were labeled with 0.1 μg/ml 12G10 on ice for 30 min (or overnight), washed in 1× PBS two times, incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 30 min, and washed in 1× PBS two times. Lymphocytes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed with the FACSCalibur flow cytometer. All integrin levels were normalized to the mean fluorescence level of integrins found on vehicle control cells (control) for each experiment. All migration and β1 integrin activation assays were analyzed by two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Naive T lymphocytes, which express CCR7, enter the lymph nodes in response to CCL21 found in high endothelial venules. To define the molecular mechanisms that control CCL21-mediated T lymphocyte migration, we used chemotaxis assays. Naive T lymphocytes were induced to migrate over a physiological range of CCL21 concentrations (10 nm to 2 μm) or in the absence of CCL21. We found that naive T lymphocytes migrated maximally to 2 μm CCL21 on polycarbonate membranes (Fig. 1A). To understand how T lymphocytes migrate via β1 integrins, we preincubated the polycarbonate membranes with the β1 integrin ligand fibronectin. Lymphocytes were induced to migrate over a wide range of physiological concentrations (10 nm to 2 μm) to CCL21, with the greatest migration occurring at 400 nm (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the cells were migrating via β1 integrins, we examined the migration in the presence of β1 integrin function-blocking antibodies. Under these conditions, the cells failed to migrate across the fibronectin-coated membranes. Isotype controls had no effect on migration (data not shown). These results implicate β1 integrins in human T lymphocyte migration to CCL21. GPCRs can activate ERK1/2 to mediate the migration of human primary macrophages and human osteosarcoma cells (12Cheung R. Malik M. Ravyn V. Tomkowicz B. Ptasznik A. Collman R.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2009; 86: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Huang C.Y. Lee C.Y. Chen M.Y. Yang W.H. Chen Y.H. Chang C.H. Hsu H.C. Fong Y.C. Tang C.H. J. Cell Physiol. 2009; 221: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To examine the role of ERK1/2 in the migration of naive T lymphocytes to CCL21 via their β1 integrins, we examined migration to CCL21 in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126. Under these conditions, naive T lymphocytes failed to migrate on fibronectin compared with controls treated with an equivalent dilution of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide; p = 0.031) (Fig. 2A). We used Western blotting to confirm that U0126 blocked MEK activation of ERK1/2. As expected, U0126 blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cells treated with CCL21 (Fig. 2B). PLCγ can mediate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (15Yang J.M. Vassil A.D. Hait W.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Rong R. Ahn J.Y. Chen P. Suh P.G. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52497-52503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of ERK1/2 to activation of PLCγ1, we probed for PLCγ1 phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, we found that phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was also decreased (Fig. 2B). From these results, we concluded that rapid ERK1/2 activation is required for migration to CCL21. Furthermore, PLCγ1 phosphorylation may be mediated by activated ERK1/2 to regulate CCL21-mediated migration. Cell migration requires regulated integrin adhesion, which is mediated by activation, followed by integrin de-adhesion (17Lo C.G. Lu T.T. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Szekanecz Z. Humphries M.J. Ager A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 885-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we questioned the role of ERK1/2 in β1 integrin activation. To this end, we pretreated lymphocytes with U0126 or an identical dilution of the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) and measured the levels of activated β1 integrins following activation with CCL21. To examine the state of the β1 integrins, lymphocytes were stained with an activation-specific antibody, 12G10 (19Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Askari J.A. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Levels of activated β1 integrins were analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that lymphocytes treated with U0126 displayed similar β1 integrin activation compared with vehicle controls (control) (Fig. 2C). From these data, we concluded that β1 integrin activation in T lymphocytes in response to stimulation of CCR7 with CCL21 is not regulated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As mentioned previously, PLCγ1 binds to and activates β1 integrins (7Vossmeyer D. Hofmann W. Löster K. Reutter W. Danker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4636-4643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the loss of ERK1/2 phosphorylation correlated with decreased PLCγ1 phosphorylation and reduced migration to CCL21, we questioned if PLC was necessary to control migration to CCL21. To this end, we used chemotaxis assays in the presence of U73122, a universal PLC inhibitor, or the U73343 control (Fig. 3A). To confirm that U73122 blocked activation of PLCγ in T lymphocytes in response to CCL21 stimulation, we assayed for phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by Western blotting. Lymphocytes pretreated with U73122 displayed decreased phosphorylation of PLCγ1 compared with the U73343-treated controls (Fig. 3B). Although U73122 blocked all migration, it was unclear why the U73343 control shifted the migratory response of cells. In contrast to the U73343-treated cells, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was delayed in the U73122-treated cells (Fig. 3B). When T lymphocytes were preincubated with U73122, migration to CCL21 was reduced compared with U73343-treated controls (Fig. 3A). From these results, we concluded that rapid phosphorylation of PLC and/or ERK1/2 mediates the migration of T lymphocytes to CCL21. Because U73122 is a universal inhibitor of PLC, to determine the role PLCγ1 in the migration of naive T lymphocytes via β1 integrins, we used PLCγ1 shRNA to specifically target and knockdown levels of PLCγ1 in primary human T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were transiently transfected with PLCγ1 shRNA or control shRNA and assayed for β1 integrin activation and migration. Using NIH ImageQuant software, we found that total PLCγ1 levels were reduced by ∼85% in the shRNA-transfected lymphocytes (Fig. 4A). T lymphocytes that were depleted of PLCγ1 failed to migrate to 400 nm CCL21 on fibronectin-coated membranes, as opposed to T lymphocytes treated with control shRNA (Fig. 4B). In addition, the loss of PLCγ1 led to a failure to activate β1 integrins in response to stimulation with 400 nm CCL21, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 4C). Because we observed delayed ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to U73122, we questioned whether this was due to an inhibition of PLCγ1. We observed that the knockdown of PLCγ1 resulted in a trend toward a rapid and sustained increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with controls (Fig. 4, D and E). From these results, we concluded that PLCγ1 is required for rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of β1 integrins, resulting in the migration of naive T lymphocytes to CCL21 on fibronectin. To examine the signaling events upstream of PLCγ1, we investigated the role of G proteins in the activation of PLCγ1. CCR7 couples to Gαi to initiate downstream signaling events and is required for migration to CCL21 (2Gunn M.D. Tangemann K. Tam C. Cyster J.G. Rosen S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine signaling events more proximal to the membrane that mediate activation of PLCγ1, we pretreated lymphocytes with pertussis toxin. As expected, lymphocytes pretreated with pertussis toxin failed to migrate to any concentration of CCL21 compared with controls (Fig. 5A). Therefore, to determine the role of Gαi in signaling through CCR7 to mediate activation of PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 in the presence of pertussis toxin, we assayed for changes in phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 in response to stimulation with 400 nm CCL21. In pertussis toxin-treated lymphocytes, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PLCγ1 was reduced following treatment with CCL21 compared with controls (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that CCR7 coupling to Gαi mediates PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and β1 integrin deactivation, leading to the migration of T lymphocytes on fibronectin. To determine the extent to which Gαi affects β1 integrin activation in naive T lymphocytes, we pretreated lymphocytes with pertussis toxin, stimulated with 400 nm CCL21, and assayed by flow cytometry for activated integrins on the cell surface. In the presence of pertussis toxin, CCL21 induced the same level of β1 integrins as in the CCL21-stimulated vehicle control cells (p = 0.365) (Fig. 5C), although cell migration to CCL21 in the presence of pertussis toxin was lost compared with control cells. In addition, there was a significant elevation in the levels of activated β1 integrins when lymphocytes were treated with CCL21 in the presence (p = 0.0014) or absence (p = 0.0236) of pertussis toxin compared with unstimulated controls in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin, respectively. There was no significant difference in the levels of activated integrins with or without pertussis toxin prior to treatment with ligand (p = 0.365). Because cell migration requires the control of integrin adhesion (activation) and de-adhesion (deactivation), from these studies, we concluded that signaling through Gαi leads to cycling of adhesion and de-adhesion states. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activation state of the β1 integrins over time (Fig. 5D). We found that although the levels of activated β1 integrins varied over time in both pertussis toxin-treated cells and control cells, the levels of activation overlapped throughout the time course. These results suggest that Gαi is important for migration to CCL21, but not for the initial activation of β1 integrins in response to CCL21 stimulation. CCR7 is expressed on B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T regulatory cells, and naive T lymphocytes and is required for their migration into and within lymph nodes. CCR7 binds to two ligands, CCL19 and CCL21. Although many studies have described CCL19 signaling through CCR7, little is known about how CCL21 signals through CCR7, leading to migration on fibronectin (20Snapper S.B. Meelu P. Nguyen D.

Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). As lymphocytes enter into and migrate through lymph nodes, they use β1 integrins for adhesion and migration (2Gunn M.D. Tangemann K. Tam C. Cyster J.G. Rosen S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Because CCL21 is required for lymph node entry as well as migration within the lymph nodes, it was important to define the CCL21-mediated mechanisms that control β1 integrin-mediated migration on fibronectin. In this study, we have provided evidence that CCL21 induces β1 integrin activation and promotes migration on fibronectin via PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. GPCRs are well known for their ability to activate MAPKs (24Gutkind J.S. Sci. STKE. 2000; 40: re1Google Scholar, 25Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). MAPKs, which are involved in many cellular processes, including migration (26Roberts O.L. Holmes K. Müller J. Cross D.A. Cross M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 1254-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Gerthoffer W.T. Proc. Am. Thorac.

Several groups have reported that stimulation of CCR7 by CCL21 mediates phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK1/2 in primary murine T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and HEK293 CCR7-transfected cells (11Redondo-Muñoz J. José Terol M. García-Marco J.A. García-Pardo A. Blood. 2008; 111: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Otero C. Eisele P.S. Schaeuble K. Groettrup M. Legler D.F. J.

Blood. 2009; 114: 580-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, from these studies, it is difficult to interpret what if any role ERK1/2 plays in the migration of T lymphocytes. In this study, similar to previous studies, we have reported that ERK1/2 is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated in response to CCR7 activation by CCL21 in primary human T lymphocytes. In addition, we found that rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is required for migration to CCL21 via CCR7 on the β1 integrin ligand fibronectin. Transient activation of ERK1/2 has been shown to be important for aortic smooth cell migration (30Mu H. Wang X. Wang H. Lin P. Yao Q. Chen C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297: H400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We used the MEK inhibitor U0126 to demonstrate that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is important for T cell migration in response to CCL21. In addition, using PLCγ1 shRNA, we found that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was sustained, which correlated with decreased migration to CCL21. Taken together, these results suggest that rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is important for migration to CCL21 in T lymphocytes. Stimulation of human epidermoid carcinoma cells with 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid results in PLCγ1 phosphorylation and downstream activation of ERK1/2 via pertussis toxin-sensitive signaling events (31Szekeres C.K. Tang K. Trikha M. Honn K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38831-38841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In our study, we found that transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is lost following reduction of PLCγ1 levels, suggesting that PLCγ1 contributes to the transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2. We determined that not only is ERK1/2 important for migration, but that PLCγ1 is also important for regulating states of ERK1/2 activation. These states of ERK1/2 activation appear to play an important role in β1 integrin deactivation. As mentioned previously, cell migration requires regulated integrin adhesion (activation) followed by de-adhesion (inactivation). Interestingly, we found that Gαi activation was not necessary for β1 integrin activation, even though pertussis toxin inhibited migration to CCL21. Furthermore, we found that pertussis toxin alone did not increase levels of activated β1 integrins, although the levels of activated β1 integrins increased in the presence of CCL21. Similar to pertussis toxin-treated cells, we found that in the presence of U0126, β1 integrins could be activated, yet migration to CCL21 was inhibited. Because pertussis toxin led to reduced levels of phosphorylation of ERK1/2, we speculated that Gαi and possibly ERK1/2 are not required for the initial activation of β1 integrins; however, they are required for de-adhesion (inactivation) of β1 integrins. Gαi is bound to the resting CCR7. Inhibition of Gαi with pertussis toxin, however, inhibits rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of PLCγ1, but leads to activation of β1 integrins. In contrast, a reduction in PLCγ1 levels following treatment with PLCγ1 shRNA blocked integrin activation. One possible explanation is that separate pools of PLCγ1 may be activated by CCR7. In that case, one pool could control β1 integrin activation, whereas the second pool would control the phosphorylation state of effectors such as PLCγ1 and ERK1/2. In the absence of Gαi, β1 integrins would be activated; however, the lymphocytes would be unable to regulate PLCγ1 activity to allow for de-adhesion of the β1 integrins, and the integrins would remain activated. Alternatively, following treatment with shRNA, other PLCs could be depleted. We concluded that it is the de-phosphorylation of ERK1/2 that is important for β1 integrin recycling and migration to CCL21. Studies are currently under way in our laboratory to sort out these hypotheses. T lymphocytes are crucial mediators of inflammation, autoimmune disorders, allergic disease, and cancer. Migration is not only important for a normal, functioning immune system, but is also important in disease. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of how T lymphocytes migrate into and throughout lymph nodes to become effector cells to carry out immune responses in the periphery. This study is an important step in further understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate T lymphocyte migration to CCL21 and provide the basis for pharmacological targets for controlling T cell entry and migration within lymph nodes to regulate the immune response. We greatly appreciate the comments and discussions with Dr. Colin Bill and the technical assistance of Dr. Heather Cunningham (The University of Kansas Medical Center)."

Pos5p is the only known NADH kinase in the mitochondrial matrix. The enzyme phosphorylates NADH to NADPH and is the major source of NADPH in the matrix. The importance of mitochondrial NADPH for cellular physiology is underscored by the phenotypes of the Δpos5 mutant, characterized by oxidative stress sensitivity and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster deficiency. Fe-S clusters are essential cofactors of proteins such as aconitase [4Fe-4S] and ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] in mitochondria. Intact mitochondria isolated from wild-type yeast can synthesize these clusters and insert them into the corresponding apoproteins. Here, we show that this process of Fe-S cluster biogenesis in wild-type mitochondria is greatly stimulated and kinetically favored by the addition of NAD+ or NADH in a dose-dependent manner, probably via transport into mitochondria and subsequent conversion into NADPH. Unlike wild-type mitochondria, Δpos5 mitochondria cannot efficiently synthesize Fe-S clusters on endogenous aconitase or imported ferredoxin, although cluster biogenesis in isolated Δpos5 mitochondria is restored to a significant extent by a small amount of imported Pos5p. Interestingly, Fe-S cluster biogenesis in wild-type mitochondria is further enhanced by overexpression of Pos5p. The effects of Pos5p on Fe-S cluster generation in mitochondria indicate that one or more steps in the biosynthetic process require NADPH.

The pyridine nucleotides play vital roles in numerous biological processes, including energy metabolism, mitochondrial functions, anti-oxidant defense, aging, and cell death (1Ying W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2008; 10: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is primarily present in the oxidized state (NAD+), but its phosphorylated counterpart (NADP) is mostly found in the reduced state (NADPH). NAD+ is well known for its role as an electron carrier in oxidoreductase reactions, particularly as the mediator of hydrogen transfer from substrates to the respiratory chain of mitochondria. On the other hand, NADPH is required for oxidative stress defense, for reductive syntheses, and for maintaining the cellular redox state (2Pollak N. Dölle C. Ziegler M. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 3Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). NAD+- and NADPH-dependent processes occur both inside and outside of the mitochondria. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NAD+ is synthesized outside, and not inside, of mitochondria. Cytosolic NAD(H) is then transported across the mitochondrial inner membrane into the matrix via carrier proteins in this membrane (4Todisco S. Agrimi G. Castegna A. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). By contrast, NADP(H) is generated separately in mitochondria and the cytosol by distinct NAD(H) kinases in these compartments (5Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Kawai S. Suzuki S. Mori S. Murata K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 200: 181-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shi F. Kawai S. Mori S. Kono E. Murata K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3337-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and no transporter for NADP(H) has been found in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The NAD(H) kinases are the sole enzymes able to convert NAD(H) to NADP(H) using ATP as a phosphate donor (8McGuinness E.T. Butler J.R. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In yeast, Pos5p is the only known NADH kinase in the mitochondrial matrix, and therefore it is the major source of mitochondrial NADPH (5Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The Δpos5 mutant is highly sensitive to H2O2, high O2 conditions, and paraquat, a superoxide-generating agent (5Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Krems B. Charizanis C. Entian K.D. Curr.

Mitochondrion. 2009; 9: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These phenotypes can be understood in terms of the mitochondrial source of reactive oxygen species leaking from the respiratory chain and the strong reliance of mitochondrial anti-oxidant defenses on enzymes that utilize NADPH. In particular, glutathione and thioredoxin are maintained in their reduced states by dedicated mitochondrial reductases that use NADPH. These reduced molecules in turn serve as cofactors for peroxidases, glutaredoxins, and peroxiredoxins involved in oxidant stress protection (1Ying W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2008; 10: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 5Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. J.

A biosynthetic role of NADPH in mitochondria was uncovered following observation of the arginine auxotrophy of the Δpos5 mutant, and the defect was explained by the lack of NADPH required for an NADPH-dependent step in arginine biosynthesis catalyzed by the mitochondrial N-acetylglutamyl phosphate reductase (5Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence or overexpression of cytosolic NAD(H) kinases (Utr1p or Yef1p) does not rescue the arginine auxotrophy of the Δpos5 mutant, indicating that NADPH generated in the cytoplasm is unable to cross into the mitochondrial matrix (17Bieganowski P. Seidle H.F. Wojcik M. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Another phenotype of the Δpos5 mutant is a marked dysregulation of iron homeostasis, with constitutive activation of the cellular iron uptake system and accumulation of iron in mitochondria (5Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This phenotype has been associated with deficiency of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters (18Chen O.S. Crisp R.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15955-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and indeed, the Δpos5 mutant exhibits deficient activities of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, two Fe-S cluster proteins of mitochondria (5Outten C.E. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2015-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fe-S clusters are essential cofactors of proteins that participate in numerous important cellular processes, including catalysis, respiration, redox reactions, DNA repair, protein translation, and O2-sensing (27Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Mitochondria contain a complete machinery for Fe-S cluster synthesis, and subsequent transfer of these cluster intermediates to apoproteins forming active holoproteins. A conundrum arises because Fe-S clusters may be sensitive to oxidants, and thus the deficient mitochondrial Fe-S cluster proteins in the Δpos5 mutant could result from excessive oxidative stress in the mutant leading to destruction of Fe-S clusters. Alternatively, the deficiency could result from failure to efficiently synthesize the Fe-S clusters. In the latter case, a direct role for NADPH in Fe-S cluster synthesis in mitochondria would be implied, perhaps implicating a specific NADPH-requiring reductase in the process. To distinguish these possibilities, we used kinetic assays able to track formation of newly made Fe-S clusters in isolated and intact mitochondria. The assays were performed with wild-type or Δpos5 mutant mitochondria, and cells as well as isolated mitochondria were manipulated in terms of oxygen exposure to decrease the level of oxidant stress. NAD(H) availability was also manipulated, and iron was added or withheld during the assays. Aconitase is an abundant [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing protein of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Upon incubation of wild-type mitochondria with [35S]cysteine, aconitase was rapidly radiolabeled indicating new Fe-S cluster synthesis. The rate and efficiency of the process in wild-type mitochondria were dependent on added NAD(H). By contrast, cluster biogenesis of aconitase was markedly impaired and retarded in the Δpos5 mutant, and low oxygen and/or NAD(H) could not rescue the defect. Similar defects were also observed for [2Fe-2S] cluster biogenesis of ferredoxin. Apoferredoxin precursor protein was imported and yet was very poorly loaded with its Fe-S cluster in Δpos5 mitochondria. These results indicate that Pos5p and by extension NADPH plays a direct role in Fe-S cluster synthesis in mitochondria. Two S. cerevisiae strains, D273-10B (ATCC 24657) and BY4741 (Invitrogen), were used for the experiments described here. Mitochondria isolated from these wild-type (WT) strains can synthesize new Fe-S clusters and insert them into apoproteins with comparable efficiency, thereby ruling out the possibility of strain-specific results (28Amutha B.

https://openalex.org/W2163970736,"LC8 dynein light chain (DYNLL) is a highly conserved eukaryotic hub protein with dozens of binding partners and various functions beyond being a subunit of dynein and myosin Va motor proteins. Here, we compared the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of binding of both mammalian isoforms, DYNLL1 and DYNLL2, to two putative consensus binding motifs (KXTQTX and XG(I/V)QVD) and report only subtle differences. Peptides containing either of the above motifs bind to DYNLL2 with micromolar affinity, whereas a myosin Va peptide (lacking the conserved Gln) and the noncanonical Pak1 peptide bind with Kd values of 9 and 40 μm, respectively. Binding of the KXTQTX motif is enthalpy-driven, although that of all other peptides is both enthalpy- and entropy-driven. Moreover, the KXTQTX motif shows strikingly slower off-rate constant than the other motifs. As most DYNLL partners are homodimeric, we also assessed the binding of bivalent ligands to DYNLL2. Compared with monovalent ligands, a significant avidity effect was found as follows: Kd values of 37 and 3.5 nm for a dimeric myosin Va fragment and a Leu zipper dimerized KXTQTX motif, respectively. Ligand binding kinetics of DYNLL can best be described by a conformational selection model consisting of a slow isomerization and a rapid binding step. We also studied the binding of the phosphomimetic S88E mutant of DYNLL2 to the dimeric myosin Va fragment, and we found a significantly lower apparent Kd value (3 μm). We conclude that the thermodynamic and kinetic fine-tuning of binding of various ligands to DYNLL could have physiological relevance in its interaction network. LC8 dynein light chain (DYNLL) is a highly conserved eukaryotic hub protein with dozens of binding partners and various functions beyond being a subunit of dynein and myosin Va motor proteins. Here, we compared the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of binding of both mammalian isoforms, DYNLL1 and DYNLL2, to two putative consensus binding motifs (KXTQTX and XG(I/V)QVD) and report only subtle differences. Peptides containing either of the above motifs bind to DYNLL2 with micromolar affinity, whereas a myosin Va peptide (lacking the conserved Gln) and the noncanonical Pak1 peptide bind with Kd values of 9 and 40 μm, respectively.

Formerly, it was widely assumed that DYNLL could function as a cargo adapter on dynein and myoVa motors (6Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C. Strasser A. Science. 2001; 293: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 21Naisbitt S. Valtschanoff J. Allison D.W. Sala C. Kim E. Craig A.M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J.

Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with the symmetric homodimeric structure of DYNLL and most of its partners, including myoVa and DIC. Instead, it has been suggested, based on the effect of DYNLL on its partner proteins, that one of the major roles of DYNLL dimers could be the ability to promote dimerization and stabilization of their interaction partners (2Hódi Z. Németh A.L. Radnai L. Hetényi C. Schlett K. Bodor A. Perczel A. Nyitray L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12582-12595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Barbar E.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4611-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).DYNLL has two mammalian isoforms (DYNLL1 and DYNLL2; previously known as DLC1 and DLC2 or LC8a and LC8b) (21Naisbitt S.

Despite their similarity, DYNLL1 and DYNLL2 seem to discriminate binding partners in the cell (6Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C. Strasser A.

J. 2004; 377: 597-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although some in vitro studies do not support this finding (21Naisbitt S. Valtschanoff J. Allison D.W. Sala C. Kim E. Craig A.M. Weinberg R.J.

The binding grooves are able to interact with short linear sequences, all of which are part of intrinsically disordered regions of the partner proteins. These binding motifs were divided into the following three classes based on sequence similarities: KXTQTX (e.g. Bmf), XG(I/V)QVD (e.g. nNOS), and noncanonical (e.g. myoVa and Pak1) (2Hódi Z.

A broad range of affinities of various binding peptides and protein fragments (Kd values between 100 nm and 100 μm), determined by different approaches, were reported (2Hódi Z. Németh A.L. Radnai L.

However, it is important to note that many of the partners were shown to exist as homodimers, and therefore DYNLL most likely forms dimer-dimer complexes with its partners (2Hódi Z. Németh A.L. Radnai L. Hetényi C. Schlett K. Bodor A. Perczel A. Nyitray L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12582-12595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Wang L. Hare M. Hays T.S. Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4611-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed dissociation constants of monomeric peptides may not be used directly to describe the interaction with dimeric partners, which in fact are bivalent protein ligands (15Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have previously reported an affinity enhancement of dimeric myoVa fragments binding to DYNLL2, compared with a monomeric peptide (2Hódi Z. Németh A.L. Radnai L. Hetényi C. Schlett K. Bodor A. Perczel A. Nyitray L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12582-12595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the same was noted for a dimeric DIC fragment (26Lightcap C.M. Sun S. Lear J.D. Rodeck U. Polenova T. Williams J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27314-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the quantitative relationship between the affinity and the monomer-dimer state of the binding partner was not investigated in previous studies.Regulation of the interactions of DYNLL as a hub protein is not well understood. Binding of the partners to DYNLL could be regulated by phosphorylation of Thr or Ser residues within the DYNLL-binding motif (32Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-88 of DYNLL could be another way of regulation by shifting the monomer-dimer equilibrium strongly to the monomer state, thus eliminating the binding grooves (29Song C. Wen W. Rayala S.K. Chen M. Ma J. Zhang M. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4004-4013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is not clear which kinase is involved in this regulation; Pak1 was originally shown to phosphorylate DYNLL (10Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Yang Z. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 654-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); however, a recent study did not support its direct regulatory role (26Lightcap C.M. Sun S. Lear J.D. Rodeck U. Polenova T. Williams J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27314-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Here, we report the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of binding of DYNLL isoforms to various partners with monovalent and bivalent motifs. We found that the affinity is dramatically increased by the bivalent nature of the binding partners. We also found that the binding reaction of both monovalent and bivalent ligands can be best explained by a conformational selection model. Furthermore, we show that ligands can bind to the S88E phosphomimetic form of DYNLL by pulling the monomer-dimer equilibrium back to the dimer state.

Formerly, it was widely assumed that DYNLL could function as a cargo adapter on dynein and myoVa motors (6Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C.

However, this hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with the symmetric homodimeric structure of DYNLL and most of its partners, including myoVa and DIC. Instead, it has been suggested, based on the effect of DYNLL on its partner proteins, that one of the major roles of DYNLL dimers could be the ability to promote dimerization and stabilization of their interaction partners (2Hódi Z.

Despite their similarity, DYNLL1 and DYNLL2 seem to discriminate binding partners in the cell (6Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C. Strasser A.

The binding grooves are able to interact with short linear sequences, all of which are part of intrinsically disordered regions of the partner proteins. These binding motifs were divided into the following three classes based on sequence similarities: KXTQTX (e.g. Bmf), XG(I/V)QVD (e.g. nNOS), and noncanonical (e.g. myoVa and Pak1) (2Hódi Z.

However, it is important to note that many of the partners were shown to exist as homodimers, and therefore DYNLL most likely forms dimer-dimer complexes with its partners (2Hódi Z. Németh A.L.

Thus, the observed dissociation constants of monomeric peptides may not be used directly to describe the interaction with dimeric partners, which in fact are bivalent protein ligands (15Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have previously reported an affinity enhancement of dimeric myoVa fragments binding to DYNLL2, compared with a monomeric peptide (2Hódi Z. Németh A.L. Radnai L. Hetényi C. Schlett K. Bodor A. Perczel A. Nyitray L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12582-12595Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the same was noted for a dimeric DIC fragment (26Lightcap C.M. Sun S. Lear J.D.

However, the quantitative relationship between the affinity and the monomer-dimer state of the binding partner was not investigated in previous studies.Regulation of the interactions of DYNLL as a hub protein is not well understood. Binding of the partners to DYNLL could be regulated by phosphorylation of Thr or Ser residues within the DYNLL-binding motif (32Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-88 of DYNLL could be another way of regulation by shifting the monomer-dimer equilibrium strongly to the monomer state, thus eliminating the binding grooves (29Song C. Wen W.

It is not clear which kinase is involved in this regulation; Pak1 was originally shown to phosphorylate DYNLL (10Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D.

We found that the affinity is dramatically increased by the bivalent nature of the binding partners. We also found that the binding reaction of both monovalent and bivalent ligands can be best explained by a conformational selection model. Furthermore, we show that ligands can bind to the S88E phosphomimetic form of DYNLL by pulling the monomer-dimer equilibrium back to the dimer state."
https://openalex.org/W2016755296,"Human prolactin (hPRL), a member of the family of hematopoietic cytokines, functions as both an endocrine hormone and autocrine/paracrine growth factor. We have previously demonstrated that recognition of the hPRL·receptor depends strongly on solution acidity over the physiologic range from pH 6 to pH 8. The hPRL·receptor binding interface contains four histidines whose protonation is hypothesized to regulate pH-dependent receptor recognition. Here, we systematically dissect its molecular origin by characterizing the consequences of His to Ala mutations on pH-dependent receptor binding kinetics, site-specific histidine protonation, and high resolution structures of the intermolecular interface. Thermodynamic modeling of the pH dependence to receptor binding affinity reveals large changes in site-specific protonation constants for a majority of interface histidines upon complexation. Removal of individual His imidazoles reduces these perturbations in protonation constants, which is most likely explained by the introduction of solvent-filled, buried cavities in the crystallographic structures without inducing significant conformational rearrangements."

Here, we report that BMP-6 induces the expression of IL-6 in macrophages. Using overexpression and knockdown experiments, we demonstrate that BMP receptor type II and activin-like kinase-2 are necessary for IL-6 induction by BMP-6. At the intracellular level, both Smad and p38 signaling pathways are required for the induction of IL-6. The cross-talk between the two pathways occurs at the level of transcription factor GATA4 and Smad 1/4. These results, taken together, demonstrate a novel BMP-6 signaling mechanism in which both the Smad and non-Smad pathways directly interact to activate the transcription of a target gene."

The mechanism by which the Loa mutation impairs the neuron-specific functions of dynein is not understood. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration arising from this mutation, we applied a cohort of biochemical methods combined with in vivo assays to systemically study the effects of the mutation on the assembly of dynein and its interaction with dynactin. We found that the Loa mutation in the heavy chain leads to increased affinity of this subunit of cytoplasmic dynein to light intermediate and a population of intermediate chains and a suppressed association of dynactin to dynein. These data suggest that the Loa mutation drives the assembly of cytoplasmic dynein toward a complex with lower affinity to dynactin and thus impairing transport of cargos that tether to the complex via dynactin. In addition, we detected up-regulation of kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) and its increased association with dynein but reduced microtubule-associated KLC1 in the Loa samples. We provide a model describing how up-regulation of KLC1 and its interaction with cytoplasmic dynein in Loa could play a regulatory role in restoring the retrograde and anterograde transport in the Loa neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1965159385,"Thrombin uses three principal sites, the active site, exosite I, and exosite II, for recognition of its many cofactors and substrates. It is synthesized in the zymogen form, prothrombin, and its activation at the end of the blood coagulation cascade results in the formation of the active site and exosite I and the exposure of exosite II. The physiological inhibitors of thrombin are all serpins, whose mechanism involves significant conformational change in both serpin and protease. It has been shown that the formation of the thrombin-serpin final complex disorders the active site and exosite I of thrombin, but exosite II is thought to remain functional. It has also been hypothesized that thrombin contains a receptor-binding site that is exposed upon final complex formation. The position of this cryptic site may depend on the regions of thrombin unfolded by serpin complexation. Here we investigate the conformation of thrombin in its final complex with serpins and find that in addition to exosite I, exosite II is also disordered, as reflected by a loss of affinity for the γ'-peptide of fibrinogen and for heparin and by susceptibility to limited proteolysis. This disordering of exosite II occurs for all tested natural thrombin-inhibiting serpins. Our data suggest a novel framework for understanding serpin function, especially with respect to thrombin inhibition, where serpins functionally ""rezymogenize"" proteases to ensure complete loss of activity and cofactor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2082771153,"Activation of thin filaments in striated muscle occurs when tropomyosin exposes myosin binding sites on actin either through calcium-troponin (Ca-Tn) binding or by actin-myosin (A-M) strong binding. However, the extent to which these binding events contributes to thin filament activation remains unclear. Here we propose a simple analytical model in which strong A-M binding and Ca-Tn binding independently activates the rate of A-M weak-to-strong binding. The model predicts how the level of activation varies with pCa as well as A-M attachment, N·k(att), and detachment, k(det), kinetics. To test the model, we use an in vitro motility assay to measure the myosin-based sliding velocities of thin filaments at different pCa, N·k(att), and k(det) values. We observe that the combined effects of varying pCa, N·k(att), and k(det) are accurately fit by the analytical model. The model and supporting data imply that changes in attachment and detachment kinetics predictably affect the calcium sensitivity of striated muscle mechanics, providing a novel A-M kinetic-based interpretation for perturbations (e.g. disease-related mutations) that alter calcium sensitivity."

Natural subtypes and site-directed mutants were used to analyze the effect of altering the peptide-binding site of this molecule on its stability, interaction with tapasin, folding, and export. The disease-associated subtypes B*2705, B*2702, and B*2704 showed higher thermostability at 50 °C than all other subtypes and mutants, except some mimicking B*2702 polymorphism. The lowest values were found among pocket B mutants, most of which interacted strongly with tapasin, but otherwise there was no correlation between thermostability and tapasin interaction.

IntroductionHLA-B27 is the major susceptibility factor for a group of chronic inflammatory diseases known as spondyloarthropathies, whose prototype is ankylosing spondylitis (AS). 2The abbreviations used are: ASankylosing spondylitisHCheavy chainβ2mβ2-microglobulinTpntapasinERendoplasmic reticulumC1RHmy2.C1RmAbmonoclonal antibodyEndo Hendoglycosidase HH/M ratioratio between the HC precipitated with HC10 and with ME1. This is a disorder characterized by inflammation of the entheses and joints of the axial skeleton, followed by pathological new bone formation, ultimately leading to ankylosis (1Braun J. Sieper J. Lancet. 2007; 369: 1379-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). HLA-B27 is involved in triggering the inflammatory process, but the mechanism is unknown. Four main hypotheses, each based on a particular property of HLA-B27, are currently being investigated. The arthritogenic peptide hypothesis (2Benjamin R. Parham P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) is based on the antigen-presenting specificity of HLA-B27 and assumes that molecular mimicry between microbial and self-derived B27 ligands would trigger autoimmune T cell cross-reaction and tissue injury. The misfolding hypothesis (3Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) is based on the slow folding and tendency to misfold of HLA-B*2705 (4Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Münz C. Zhu X. Stevanoviæ S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar) and assumes that accumulation of misfolded B27 heavy chain (HC) could trigger inflammation by eliciting the unfolded protein response and activation of NFκB. The surface homodimer hypothesis (5Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bowness P. Rheumatology. 2002; 41: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is based on the expression of HC homodimers at the cell surface, following dissociation of HLA-B27-peptide complexes upon endosomal recycling (7Bird L.A. Peh C.A. Kollnberger S. Elliott T. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the assumption that differential recognition of heterodimeric and homodimeric forms of HLA-B27 by leukocyte receptors (8Kollnberger S. Bird L. Sun M.Y. Retiere C. Braud V.M. McMichael A. Bowness P. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) might have an immunomodulatory role of pathological consequences (9Edwards J.C. Bowness P. Archer J.R. Immunol.

Rheumatology. 2006; 45: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The β2-microglobulin (β2m) deposition hypothesis (11Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) assumes that tissue damage might arise from slow β2m deposition in the joints following dissociation of HLA-B27 at the cell surface. An attempt to unify these ideas was based on the pivotal role of peptide binding in determining not only the specificity of antigen presentation by MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules but also their stability, folding, and dissociation (12Marcilla M. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2008; 71: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Many studies have addressed the nature of HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoires and the influence of subtype polymorphism on peptide specificity (13Lopez de Castro J.A. Alvarez I. Marcilla M. Paradela A. Ramos M. Sesma L. Vázquez M. Tissue Antigens. 2004; 63: 424-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Ben Dror L. Barnea E. Beer I. Mann M. Admon A. Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62: 420-429PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction analyses have unveiled the detailed binding mode of HLA-B27 ligands (15Ziegler A. Loll B. Misselwitz R. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Lopez-Larrea C. Díaz-Peña R. Molecular Mechanisms of Spondyloarthropathies. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2009: 177-195Google Scholar). The main anchor residue of HLA-B27-bound peptides is R2, whose side chain fits in the B pocket of the peptide-binding site, a feature conserved in all the major B27 subtypes. The A pocket, also conserved among natural subtypes, except in B*2703, interacts with the peptidic N terminus and makes a significant contribution to binding. The C-terminal residue, another major anchor of B27 ligands, interacts in the F pocket, which is variable among subtypes and responsible for much of their differential binding specificity. Mutations in the B pocket (4Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Münz C. Zhu X. Stevanoviæ S. Rammensee H.G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dangoria N.S.

Optimization of the MHC-I-bound peptide repertoires occurs in the peptide-loading complex (18Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), through the editing function of tapasin (Tpn), one of its constitutive components (19Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Quality control mechanisms (20Chapman D.C. Williams D.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) prevent the export of suboptimal MHC-I-peptide complexes. These mechanisms, which are yet insufficiently characterized, involve the retention of suboptimally loaded MHC-I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their retrieval from early secretory compartments, in a process mediated by Tpn (21Paulsson K.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Griffith J. Jevon M. Chen S. Anderson P.O. Sjogren H.O. Li S. Wang P. J. Biol.

Thus, the stability of B27-peptide complexes is a key feature linking peptide binding, folding, export, and post-ER dissociation. In this study, we used natural subtypes and mutants to define how molecular polymorphism all along the peptide-binding site affects the stability of HLA-B27 and its interaction with Tpn, and how these features relate to folding, export, and disease association.RESULTSThermostability of HLA-B27 Subtypes and MutantsThis was analyzed in a panel of C1R transfectant cells (Table 1). The dissociation of pulse-labeled HLA-B27-peptide complexes was assessed by immunoprecipitation with ME1 after incubation of the lysates obtained at 0-, 2-, and 4-h chase times, at temperatures ranging from 4 to 50 °C. The thermostability was measured as the percentage of the HC immunoprecipitated with ME1 at a given temperature, relative to the amount immunoprecipitated at 4 °C (Figs. 1 and supplemental Figs. 2S–S6). This parameter reflects the global stability of the peptide cargo at a given time. B*2705 acquired very high thermostability (98 ± 3%) at 50 °C after 4 h of chase, in agreement with previous reports (19Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 33Merino E. Galocha B. Vázquez M.N. López de Castro J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A similar behavior was observed for B*2702 and B*2704. All other subtypes analyzed formed less stable complexes, showing significant dissociation at 50 °C even at a 4-h chase time (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2).In similar experiments, all pocket A (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S3) and B (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S4) mutants showed decreased thermostability, relative to B*2705. The thermostability of pocket A mutants, at 50 °C and a 4-h chase, was in the range of 57% (H171) to 67% (T163). The effect of mutations in the B pocket was more pronounced. Except for Q70, the relative thermostability of these mutants at a 4-h chase and 50 °C was in the range of 10% (A24V67) to 44% (V67). These results are consistent with the significance of pockets A and B in peptide binding and demonstrate their contribution to the molecular stability of HLA-B27.Among the eight mutants mimicking B*2701 and B*2702 polymorphism (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S5), those including the I80 and/or A81 changes showed a thermostability similar to or slightly lower than B*2705. N77 and, more prominently, Y74 and Y74N77 showed significantly decreased thermostability, as did all five mutants mimicking B*2704 and B*2706 polymorphism (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. S6).The high thermostability of B*2702 and B*2704 may be explained by compensatory effects of I80 and A81 on the decreased thermostability induced by the N77 change, and between S77 and E152, respectively. The lower thermostability of B*2701 and B*2706 correlates with a similar behavior of Y74 and Y74N77 and of D114, Y116, and D114Y116, respectively.The differences in thermostability among HLA-B27 variants were revealed mainly at temperatures above 37 °C and were much smaller at the physiological temperature (supplemental Figs. S2–S6). This does not mean that such differences are irrelevant in vivo, because they reflect real effects on the overall affinity of peptide binding that might affect molecular stability at physiological conditions such as, for instance, in acidic intracellular environments or at sites of inflammation where a temperature increase takes place.Optimization of the Stability of HLA-B27 VariantsShortly after synthesis, the B*2705-bound peptide repertoire is suboptimal, but Tpn-mediated editing ensures binding of ligands with higher stability (19Williams A.P. Peh C.A. Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The optimization of the peptide cargoes of HLA-B27 variants was analyzed by measuring the thermostability increase as a function of time in pulse-chase experiments (supplemental Figs. S2–S6). The magnitude of this optimization can be appreciated by comparing the 50 °C values at 0 and 4 h of chase (Fig. 2). HLA-B27 subtypes showed variable degrees of thermostability increase (Fig. 2A). Among pocket A mutants (Fig. 2B), T163 reached its maximal stability shortly after synthesis, whereas all other mutants showed a significant time-dependent increase, which reached 4.7-fold in the case of H171. A comparable variability was observed among pocket B mutants (Fig. 2C), ranging from 2.1-fold (S67) to no optimization (i.e. Q70, A24, and A24V67). Among mutants mimicking subtype polymorphism (Fig. 2, D and E), little optimization was observed in mutants involving residues 77 and/or 80. In contrast, mutants involving residues 74, 114, and/or 116 and E152 showed a significant increase (about 1.6–1.9-fold), which was maximal (3.1-fold) for A81.FIGURE 2Time-dependent thermostability increase among HLA-B27 variants. Bar diagrams show the thermostability expressed as the % HC recovered by immunoprecipitation with ME1 after incubation at 50 °C, relative to that recovered at 4 °C, measured 15 min after synthesis (0 h of chase, white bars) or at 4 h of chase (black bars). The data are means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. A, HLA-B27 subtypes. B, pocket A mutants. C, pocket B mutants. D, mutants mimicking B*2701 and B*2702 polymorphism. E, mutants mimicking B*2704 and B*2706 polymorphism.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In all the cases tested, the thermostability increase occurred equally in the presence of brefeldin A (data not shown), suggesting that optimization of the molecular stability takes place in the ER. The magnitude of this process was unrelated to the maximal thermostability reached by any given variant and to the molecular location of the amino acid changes. However, a statistically significant correlation (p, 0.47 × 10−4) was found between the effect of the mutation(s) on hydrophobicity and the increase in thermostability between 0 and 4 h of chase (Fig. 3). All eight mutations resulting in increased polarity showed a ≥1.7-fold thermostability increase with time (mean, 2.4 ± 1), whereas only 4 of 24 variants resulting in increased or unaltered hydrophobicity reached such a ratio (mean, 1.4 ± 0.3). This strongly suggests that the optimization rate of the molecular stability among HLA-B27 variants is, at least partially, driven by the destabilizing effect of solvent-exposed nonpolar residues in the MHC molecule, whose isolation from water through interaction with the peptide ligand would be thermodynamically favored.FIGURE 3Relationship between the stabilization rate of HLA-B27 variants and the changes in polarity induced by mutations. The ratio between the thermostability of each variant at 4 and 0 h of chase and at 50 °C is plotted against the changes in hydrophilicity induced by the corresponding amino acid change(s), using the hydrophilicity scale of Hopp and Woods for amino acids (64Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Significant time-dependent increase of the thermostability at 50 °C was observed in multiple variants that showed high thermostability at 37 °C (i.e. B*2705, B*2702, B*2704, A81, etc.). This strongly suggests that the differences observed at 50 °C are physiologically relevant, because optimization of the molecular stability of B27-peptide complexes proceeds in vivo above thresholds that are not revealed by thermostability assays performed at 37 °C.Interaction of HLA-B27 Variants with TapasinThis was analyzed by co-precipitation of 5-h labeled subtypes and mutants with PaSta-1 and measured as the amount of HC, relative to Tpn, precipitated with the anti-Tpn mAb (HC/Tpn ratio) (Fig. 4). This parameter cannot distinguish between a weak interaction and a short lived one. Because peptide editing can occur at a fast rate, the HC/Tpn ratio does not necessarily reflect the degree of Tpn dependence or correlate with the time-dependent optimization of the peptide cargo, but it indicates the amount of HC bound to Tpn in the steady state. Among subtypes, only B*2705 and B*2709 showed high HC/Tpn ratios. The strong interaction of B*2709 with Tpn was also observed in 721.221 cells (34Blanco-Gelaz M.A. Suárez-Alvarez B. Díaz-Peña R. López-Larrea C. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Goodall J.C. Ellis L. Hill Gaston J.S. Arthritis Rheum. 2006; 54: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The lower values in other subtypes (33–43%, relative to B*2705) were accounted for by similar effects of many of the mutations mimicking subtype changes, especially those affecting residue 77. Y116 behaved similarly to B*2709 (H116) and was the only mutant among those mimicking subtype polymorphism whose interaction with Tpn was increased, relative to B*2705. However, the effect of this residue was strongly influenced by co-occurrence of additional changes, as shown by the significantly lower HC/Tpn ratios of B*2706, B*2707, and D114Y116. All the A pocket mutations resulted in decreased HC/Tpn ratios, with H171 showing the smallest alteration. Among B pocket mutants, A24 and A24V67 showed very high HC/Tpn ratios, and Y9, S67, and M45 were similar to B*2705, and V67, Q70, and Y9Q70 showed decreased interaction (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Co-precipitation of HLA-B27 HC with the anti-Tpn mAb PaSta-1. C1R transfectants were labeled for 5 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The right panels show the autoradiograms of representative experiments corresponding to co-precipitation of the indicated HLA-B27 variants. The HC co-precipitated with Tpn showed up as two bands, whose intensity sometimes exhibited an inverse relationship relative to each other, that were Endo H-sensitive in all the cases tested (data not shown). The asterisks indicate nonspecific bands. The histograms in the left panels show the HC/Tpn ratios of the indicated variants, relative to B*2705 (HC/Tpn ratio, 1.1 ± 0.1). These were calculated by densitometric analysis of the corresponding autoradiograms. The values are means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. The two upper panels correspond to subtypes and mutants mimicking subtype changes. The two lower panels correspond to pocket A and B mutants, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Variable Relationships between Thermostability and Interaction with Tpn among HLA-B27 VariantsThese were classified in three groups according to their thermostability and HC/Tpn ratio (Fig. 5). Group 1 consisted of variants with high thermostability (B*2702, B*2704, I80, A81, and I80A81), all of which showed lower HC/Tpn ratio than B*2705. Group 2 consisted of variants showing decreased thermostability, and HC/Tpn ratio ⩽80%, relative to B*2705. This group included four subtypes (B*2701, B*2703, B*2706, and B*2707), all pocket A (N63, T163, S167, and H171), three pocket B (V67, Q70, and Y9Q70), and multiple mutants mimicking subtype polymorphism. Group 3 consisted of variants with strongly decreased thermostability (about 50% or lower) and HC/Tpn ratio >80%, relative to B*2705. This group included B*2709, Y116, and most of the B pocket mutants. The average thermostability and HC/Tpn ratio in groups 1 (99 ± 3/62 ± 25), 2 (57 ± 13/51 ± 13), and 3 (32 ± 14/151 ± 60) showed an inverse relationship between both features only in group 3. The variants in group 1 showed that high thermostability can be achieved with very different degrees of Tpn interaction. The variants in group 2 showed that, for intermediate thermostability values, B27 variants often require a lower interaction with Tpn than B*2705 to load their optimal peptide cargo. Within group 3, the highest interaction with Tpn was associated with very low thermostability (A24, A24V67) or with the presence of a single change at position 116 (B*2709, Y116).FIGURE 5Relationship between thermostability and interaction with Tpn. HLA-B27 variants were classified in three groups according to their thermostability and HC/Tpn ratios, relative to B*2705. Group 1 consisted of variants with high thermostability (>80% at 50 °C and 4 h of chase). Group 2 consisted of variants showing both decreased (≤80%) thermostability and HC/Tpn ratio. Group 3 consisted of variants with strongly decreased thermostability (about 50% or lower) and high HC/Tpn ratio (>80%). The data are means ± S.D. of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A comparison of FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5 shows that the magnitude of the time-dependent optimization of the peptide cargo is independent of the maximal thermostability attained by B27 variants and is also not related to the steady-state interaction with Tpn. For instance, I80 and A81 (Fig. 5, group 1) showed very high thermostability at 50 °C and a 4-h chase and similar HC/Tpn ratios, but their thermostability increase at 4 versus 0 h of chase (Fig. 2D) were 1.1- and 3.1-fold, respectively. Similarly, Q70 and H171 (Fig. 5, group 2) showed 1.0- and 4.1-fold thermostability increase, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). Those variants with the lowest thermostability, A24 and A24V67 (Fig. 5, group 3), showed the maximal association with Tpn but no optimization (Fig. 2C).Folding and Export of HLA-B27 Variants: Relationship to ThermostabilityThe folding and export features of several HLA-B27 subtypes and mutants were previously reported (17Galocha B. López de Castro J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended these studies to include B*2701, B*2703, mutants affecting pockets A and B, and those mimicking B*2701 polymorphism and to relate folding and export to the molecular stability of HLA-B27 variants. Two parameters were used to estimate folding. First, the ratio between unfolded and folded HC immunoprecipitated with HC10 and ME1, respectively, in pulse-chase experiments (H/M ratio). This reflects the folding rate and, at 0 h of chase, the folding efficiency of newly synthesized molecules. Second, the half-life of unfolded HC (t½HC) was estimated from the amount of HC10-immunoprecipitated material along the chase. This reflects the folding rate of the HC and the presence of misfolded HC that fails to progress toward formation of the canonic heterodimers. Export rates were assessed by measuring the acquisition of Endo H resistance, which takes place during transit of glycoproteins through the Golgi apparatus, in pulse-chase experiments. We have previously shown that the differences in HC protein expression among C1R transfectant cells (supplemental Fig. S1) do not provide a trivial explanation for the differences in folding and export among B27 variants (17Galocha B. López de Castro J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).HLA-B27 variants were classified in two groups according to their export rates as follows: 1) those similar or slower than B*2705 and 2) those with faster export rates (Fig. 6). Each group was in turn subdivided in three subgroups according to their folding features as follows.FIGURE 6Comparison of the export rate (time of acquisition of 50% Endo H resistance), folding features (H/M ratio and t½HC), and thermostability, at 50 °C and 4 h of chase, among HLA-B27 subtypes and mutants. All values are relative to B*2705 (export rate, 52 ± 9 min; H/M ratio, 32 ± 11; t½HC, 101 ± 12 min; thermostability, 98 ± 3%). HLA-B27 variants were classified in groups 1 and 2 according to their export rates (≥80 and <80%, respectively) and further subdivided in 3 subgroups each according to their folding features, as explained under “Results.” The data are means ± S.D. of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subgroup 1A, Variants with H/M Ratio and t½HC ⩾80% Relative to B*2705For subgroup 1A, they show slow folding, and their large t½HC suggests a strong tendency to misfold. This subgroup included B*2705 and four mutants (Y9, Q70, A81, and N77A81) with diverse molecular locations (pockets B and F) and variable thermostability, which showed a roughly inverse correlation with the export rates.Subgroup 1B, Variants with H/M Ratio <80% and t½HC ≥100% Relative to B*2705For subgroup 1B, they all had lower thermostability than B*2705, which also showed a generally inverse correlation with the export rates. These mutants may acquire a folded conformation shortly after synthesis but are delayed in the ER due to quality control. The large t½HC, associated in most of the variants in this subset to low H/M ratios, probably reflects HC misfolding. The alternative possibility that a fraction of the B27-peptide complexes may fold quickly, although another fraction folds much more slowly, would imply the existence of two peptide subsets with sharply distinct affinities, which seems unlikely. This subgroup consists of 10 mutants, including 6 in the A (N63 and T163) or B pockets (A24, S67, A24V67, Y9Q70) and 4 mimicking subtype polymorphism (Y74, N77, D114, D114Y116).Subgroup 1C, Variants with H/M Ratio and t½HC <80% Relative to B*2705For subgroup 1C, this group consists of 4 mutants (M45, I80, Y116, and H171) distributed all along the peptide-binding site (pockets A, B, and F) and differing widely in thermostability. They fold quickly and probably undergo little or no misfolding but are apparently retained in the ER due to quality control. Unlike other mutants in this group, the large export rate of I80 is difficult to explain by a suboptimal peptide cargo, because this mutant reached very high thermostability shortly after synthesis (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S4). This suggests that factors other than peptide optimization might delay its exit from the ER.Subgroup 2A, H/M Ratio and t½HC ⩾80% Relative to B*2705For subgroup 2A, this subgroup consisted only of B*2702. The subtype was very similar to B*2705 in folding and thermostability, but its export rate was faster.Subgroup 2B, Relative H/M Ratio <80% and t½HC ≥100%For subgroup 2B,"
https://openalex.org/W2021606546,"Troponin is a pivotal regulatory protein that binds Ca(2+) reversibly to act as the muscle contraction on-off switch. To understand troponin function, the dynamic behavior of the Ca(2+)-saturated cardiac troponin core domain was mapped in detail at 10 °C, using H/D exchange-mass spectrometry. The low temperature conditions of the present study greatly enhanced the dynamic map compared with previous work. Approximately 70% of assessable peptide bond hydrogens were protected from exchange sufficiently for dynamic measurement. This allowed the first characterization by this method of many regions of regulatory importance. Most of the TnI COOH terminus was protected from H/D exchange, implying an intrinsically folded structure. This region is critical to the troponin inhibitory function and has been implicated in thin filament activation. Other new findings include unprotected behavior, suggesting high mobility, for the residues linking the two domains of TnC, as well as for the inhibitory peptide residues preceding the TnI switch helix. These data indicate that, in solution, the regulatory subdomain of cardiac troponin is mobile relative to the remainder of troponin. Relatively dynamic properties were observed for the interacting TnI switch helix and TnC NH(2)-domain, contrasting with stable, highly protected properties for the interacting TnI helix 1 and TnC COOH-domain. Overall, exchange protection via protein folding was relatively weak or for a majority of peptide bond hydrogens. Several regions of TnT and TnI were unfolded even at low temperature, suggesting intrinsic disorder. Finally, change in temperature prominently altered local folding stability, suggesting that troponin is an unusually mobile protein under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2099644949,"Striated muscles are relaxed under low Ca(2+) concentration conditions due to actions of the thin filament protein troponin. To investigate this regulatory mechanism, an 11-residue segment of cardiac troponin I previously termed the inhibitory peptide region was studied by mutagenesis. Several mutant troponin complexes were characterized in which specific effects of the inhibitory peptide region were abrogated by replacements of 4-10 residues with Gly-Ala linkers. The mutations greatly impaired two of troponin's actions under low Ca(2+) concentration conditions: inhibition of myosin subfragment 1 (S1)-thin filament MgATPase activity and cooperative suppression of myosin S1-ADP binding to thin filaments with low myosin saturation. Inhibitory peptide replacement diminished but did not abolish the Ca(2+) dependence of the ATPase rate; ATPase rates were at least 2-fold greater when Ca(2+) rather than EGTA was present. This residual regulation was highly cooperative as a function of Ca(2+) concentration, similar to the degree of cooperativity observed with WT troponin present. Other effects of the mutations included 2-fold or less increases in the apparent affinity of the thin filament regulatory Ca(2+) sites, similar decreases in the affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin regardless of Ca(2+), and increases in myosin S1-thin filament ATPase rates in the presence of saturating Ca(2+). The overall results indicate that cooperative myosin binding to Ca(2+)-free thin filaments depends upon the inhibitory peptide region but that a cooperatively activating effect of Ca(2+) binding does not. The findings suggest that these two processes are separable and involve different conformational changes in the thin filament."
