https://openalex.org/W1481065513,"A reconstituted reticulocyte translation system originally designed to be deficient in eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF-4B) was used to identify a new activity required for maximal synthesis of rabbit globin. This new activity purifies as a stable, high molecular weight complex by a variety of chromatographic procedures and is termed eIF-4F. The purified globin stimulatory activity also restores translation of capped mRNAs in extracts of poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. Like restoring activity that was obtained as a protein complex by different procedures (Tahara, S. M., Morgan, M. A. and Shatkin, A. J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 791-794), eIF-4F includes the 24,000-dalton cap binding protein and major polypeptides of Mr approximately 200,000 and approximately 46,000. The latter component comigrates with eIF-4A by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and, like eIF-4A, chemically cross-links to the 5'-end of capped mRNA by an ATP-dependent, m7GDP-sensitive reaction. Unlike eIF-4F, cap binding protein of Mr approximately 24,000 isolated by affinity chromatography on m7GDP-Sepharose does not stimulate globin synthesis in the reconstituted system."

Specific spots in the complex cytoplasmic protein gel pattern which corresponded to the initiation factor proteins were identified by co-migration of purified initiation factors with 35S-labeled cell lysates, partial proteolytic digestion mapping, and immunoblotting analysis using antisera or affinity-purified antibodies to the initiation factors. Spots identified as eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 alpha, eIF-2 beta, eIF-2 gamma, eIF-4A, and four eIF-3 proteins of less than 50,000 Da corresponded to moderately abundant lysate proteins. Minor isoelectric variant forms of eIF-2 beta, eIF-2 gamma, and eIF-4A were detected by immunoblot analysis of lysate proteins, suggesting either covalent modification of these factor proteins or contaminating antibodies. eIF-2 beta and eIF-4B were present in at least two isoelectric forms, confirming covalent modification of these proteins. The cellular levels of the initiation factor proteins were measured by excising and counting radioactivity in gel-resolved spots corresponding to factors in lysates labeled in vivo. The individual factor protein abundancies span nearly a 10-fold range, from 1.1 to 9.8 million molecules/cell. The factor to ribosome ratio for eIF-2 was 0.8, for the average eIF-3 protein about 0.6, and for eIF-4A it was significantly higher at 3.0."
https://openalex.org/W1535803418,"The zona pellucida is an extracellular glycocalyx that surrounds the growing oocyte and mediates specific biological functions essential to early mammalian development. We have isolated by a novel technique intact zonae pellucidae from a murine follicle culture system which mimics in vivo granulosa cell-oocyte interactions. Using radioactive precursors we have demonstrated that all three zona proteins, ZP-1, ZP-2, and ZP-3, are sulfated glycoproteins. Incubation of the follicle culture with tunicamycin (0.5 microgram/ml), an antibiotic that blocks N-glycosylation, inhibits new protein deposition in the zona. Under these same conditions overall protein synthesis is decreased only 30%. Biosynthetic studies indicate that after 6 days in culture the zona proteins are produced at 0.4 pg/oocyte/h, which represents 2-3% of the total oocyte protein synthesis. This synthesis stops at or before ovulation and the extremely long half-life (greater than 100 h) of the zona may be essential to preserve its known biological functions, all of which occur after ovulation."

This technique was used previously to monitor the spontaneous transfer of soluble NBD-lipid monomers between vesicles (Nichols, J. W., and Pagano, R. E. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 1720-1726). The transfer rates and lipid specificity of bovine liver phosphatidylcholine-specific transfer protein measured with the resonance energy transfer assay were found to be similar to those obtained using radiolabeled phospholipids. In addition, when the resonance energy transfer assay was used to determine the rates of transfer of phospholipids mediated by bovine liver nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsL-TP), the relative rates of acceleration in the presence of the protein were found to be the same as that determined using radiolabeled phospholipids (phosphatidic acid > phosphatidylcholine > phosphatidylethanolamine). The nsL-TPdependent transfer of a series of NBD-labeled lipids was highly correlated with their spontaneous rates of transfer over a range of spontaneous rates spanning three orders of magnitude. Since spontaneous intervesicular transfer of NBD-labeled lipids has been demonstrated to occur via the convection of soluble monomers through the aqueous phase (see reference above), we propose that nsL-TP functions by increasing the rate of the spontaneous transfer process by binding to the vesicle surface and nonspecifically increasing the rate of monomer-vesicle dissociation and association."

https://openalex.org/W1487445277,"The kinetics of Na/succinate cotransport across renal brush-borders was studied using membrane vesicles. Initial rates of succinate uptake (Js) were estimated from 1-s uptakes measured under voltage-clamped conditions. Lowering the external (cis) sodium concentration reduced the succinate Kt without affecting the Jsmax. Increasing the intravesicular (trans) sodium concentration reduced both Jsmax and Kt. This trans inhibition by Na was relieved by trans-succinate. Varying the membrane potential from -60 to +60 reduced succinate transport in an exponential manner, which was reflected by a Kt effect, i.e. an increase in the Kt with no change in Jsmax. The membrane potential results suggest that the succinate/sodium-carrier complex bears a net positive charge. On the basis of these and earlier observations, we propose that Na/succinate cotransport across renal brush-borders is described by an Iso Ordered Quad Quad reaction kinetics in which three Na ions first bind to the carrier to increase its affinity for succinate."
https://openalex.org/W1558567754,"The kinetics of transfer of [3H]cholesterol between human erythrocytes and plasma at 37 degrees C in physiological buffer had these features. 1) Cholesterol transfer was strikingly similar in both directions. 2) Transfer progressed to isotopic equilibrium in a monotonic, apparently first order fashion, except for a minor rapid component (approximately 15%) observed in the transfer of cholesterol from cells to plasma. 3) The mechanism of transfer was not via transient collisions in that the rate of the reaction was quite insensitive to the concentration of reactants over a wide range. 4) The mechanism of transfer did not involve specific, stable complex formation in that there was little difference in the behavior of erythrocytes and inside-out plasma membrane vesicles derived therefrom or between plasma and sonicated liposomes as acceptors. Furthermore, transfer was not affected by vigorous proteolysis of either the cells or the plasma. 5) The kinetics of transfer were fully compatible with diffusion of cholesterol through the aqueous compartment. This was shown by fitting our data to a rigorous model for diffusion equilibrium between three compartments. 6) The partition coefficient of [3H]cholesterol between red cells and buffer was shown to be 10(7). 7) The rate constants for cholesterol release from both red cells and plasma were approximately 1 X 10(-4) s-1 (t 1/2 approximately 2 h). The rate constant for cholesterol uptake into red cells was approximately 1 X 10(3) s-1 (t 1/2 approximately 1 ms). 8) The similarity of the corresponding kinetic constants among red cells, plasma, and liposomes suggests that phospholipids in a variety of physical forms are equivalent solvents for cholesterol. We conclude that despite its extremely low solubility in water, cholesterol moves between lipid compartments by aqueous diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W1534768850,"We have examined the effects of phospholipase C pretreatment on Ca2+ transport in highly purified canine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. Na+-Ca2+ exchange, measured as Nai+-dependent Ca2+ uptake, is stimulated when 10-70% of the membrane phospholipid has been hydrolyzed. Although the phospholipase C treatment also increases sarcolemmal passive Ca2+ flux, the membrane maintains a sufficient permeability barrier for enhanced transport (via Na+-Ca2+ exchange) to be observed. These effects can be obtained with phospholipase C from either Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus cereus. We find that the phospholipase C (C. perfringens) preferentially hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin leaving the negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, intact. This suggests that the presence of negatively charged phospholipids is sufficient to ensure Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. Thin section electron microscopy reveals gross morphological changes in phospholipase C-treated sarcolemma. The vesicles are aggregated and diacylglycerol droplets are visible. Fusion occurs such that adjacent vesicles share a common bilayer. It is surprising that vesicles displaying severe structural damage can demonstrate enhanced transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1568187381,"Procollagen IV was isolated from culture media of the mouse endodermal cell line PF-HR9. Some of the triple helical procollagen IV molecules were associated at their NH2 ends to tetramers which were identified by electron microscopy, velocity sedimentation, and electrophoresis. The formation of these tetramers in cell cultures and from isolated procollagen IV molecules was investigated. After an initial noncovalent association, which is reversible, disulfide bonds form between molecules. Even alkylated molecules form disulfide-linked tetramers when exposed to a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione. This reaction requires an adequate concentration of procollagen and is not facilitated by added laminin, Ca2+, or Mg2+ ions. Cystine, as a normal constituent of cell culture media, interferes in tetramer assembly, presumably by forming mixed disulfides. Tetramers formed normally and under the influence of glutathione are similar, but probably not identical, and resemble those isolated from fragmented basement membranes. We conclude that the NH2 ends of procollagen IV molecules can associate into tetramers without the help of other molecules and that disulfide bridges subsequently stabilize the association in various ways."
https://openalex.org/W1587975081,"Maize chloroplast tRNA genes encoding tRNA3Ser, tRNAPhe, tRNA2Thr, tRNA2Leu, and tRNAmMet, and their flanking regions have been sequenced. All five gene sequences show features commonly found in the few chloroplast tRNA genes sequenced so far; none of them encodes the 3'-terminal CCA triplet and none of them shows abnormal loop or stem lengths as seen in some genes for mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs. The 5'-flanking regions of some of these tRNA genes contain nucleotide stretches strongly homologous to and -10 promoter regions of bacterial genes. Analysis of these conserved regions together with those seen in other plastid genes yields the consensus sequences ATTGANA at -35 and TAAGAT at -10. The 3'-flanking regions of some tRNA genes show dyad symmetries followed by a stretch of Thds. These and other regions may be involved in transcription termination or transcript processing."

https://openalex.org/W1541176278,"Regulation of the in vitro synthesis of the serum amyloid proteins A and P has been studied with hepatocyte cultures from CBA/J and C3H/HeJ mice. Liver cells were isolated by the collagenase perfusion technique and established for 48 h in the presence of fetal calf serum. Viable cells could then be maintained in the absence of serum for at least 72 h and in the presence of serum for up to 2 weeks. Serum amyloid A synthesis differed from serum amyloid P synthesis in three significant ways. 1) Serum amyloid A production was stimulated in the presence of fetal calf serum, whereas serum amyloid P was not; 2) serum amyloid A synthesis was increased 200% by monokine-rich macrophage supernatants while serum amyloid P was increased only 10 to 20%; 3) serum amyloid A synthesis was strikingly resistant to cycloheximide inhibition as compared with serum amyloid P and other liver proteins. It is concluded that the in vivo asynchrony of the acute phase serum amyloid A and serum amyloid P responses results at least in part from differences in regulatory mechanisms for their synthesis by hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1547198991,"Purified lysosomal alpha-mannosidase from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, is composed of two subunits of Mr = 58,000 and 60,000 as revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The pattern of peptide fragments produced when these two species are digested with proteases indicates that they are related but not identical. Using monoclonal antibodies prepared against purified alpha-mannosidase, we have analyzed the different forms of the enzyme synthesized in vivo. In addition to two bands that co-migrate with the pure enzyme, a large Mr (140,000) species is found in immunoprecipitated [35S] methionine-labeled extracts of cellular and secreted proteins. The precipitation of all three bands is inhibited by preadsorption of the antibodies with pure enzyme and all three proteins are absent in extracts of an alpha-mannosidase structural gene mutant. One-dimensional peptide maps indicate that all sequences present in the smaller species are found in the Mr = 140,000 form. In addition, the large form accounts for about 20% of the extracellular alpha-mannosidase activity secreted by amoebae during growth in axenic culture. These results lead to the conclusion that alpha-mannosidase is first synthesized as a large enzymatically active precursor which is modified and proteolytically cleaved to form the smaller subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1518630967,"The quantity and molar ratio of the three troponin subunits to actin were determined in rabbit psoas muscle, muscle homogenates (800 X g pellet), and purified myofibrils. Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The quantities of the separated proteins were determined directly from the gel slices by amino acid analysis after correction for losses and background. The molar ratio of actin, troponin T, troponin I, and troponin C was found to be 6.99:1:05:1:04:0.92 in purified myofibrils and was not significantly different (p greater than 0.05) from those obtained from 800 X g pellets of muscle homogenates or intact muscle tissue. Isolated troponin purified by several different procedures also had a 1:1:1 subunit ratio although the variability was much greater than that found in myofibrils. The troponin content of rabbit psoas muscle and myofibrils was 91 +/- 16 and 770 +/- 110 pmol/mg, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1601785347,"Amino acid sequences of three canine bombesin-like peptides were determined after sequential purification of an extract obtained from 820 g of intestinal muscle. These three peptides contained 27, 23, and 10 amino acid residues. The sequences of the two shorter forms were identical to the corresponding carboxyl-terminal sequence of the heptacosapeptide. The sequence of the largest peptide is H2N-Ala-Pro-Val-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gly-Thr-Val-Leu-Asp-Lys-Met-Tyr-Pro-Arg-Gly-Asn - His(Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-CONH2). The sequence of the 23-residue peptide is H2N-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gly-Thr-Val-Leu-Asp-Lys-Met-Tyr-Pro-Arg-Gly-Asn-His-Trp-Ala- Val-Gly(His-Leu-Met-CONH2). The sequence of the decapeptide is: H2N-Gly-Asn-His-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-CONH2. Comparison of the 27-residue peptide with the known structure of porcine gastrin-releasing peptide, another bombesin-like heptacosapeptide, reveals four amino acid substitutions: canine bombesin-like peptide had Pro 4, Gly 5, Gln 7, Asp 12, whereas porcine gastrin-releasing peptide had Ser 4, Val 5, Gly 7, Ala 12. Radioimmunoassay of brain extracts after similar purification revealed the presence of similar large and small forms of immunoreactive bombesin peptides, but with apparent tissue concentrations of about 4% of those present in intestinal muscle. Canine bombesin-like peptides represent another example of mammalian neuropeptides existing in more than one biologically active molecular form."

https://openalex.org/W1489550700,"The relative degradation of the various molecular species of phosphatidylinositol in response to thrombin was studied in human platelets. For this purpose, platelets were prelabeled with [2-3H]glycerol and the loss of radioactivity from the saturated, monoenoic, dienoic, trienoic, tetraenoic, and greater than tetraenoic [3H]phosphatidylinositols was determined after conversion to their 1,2-diacylglycerol acetate derivatives and fractionation by argentation thin layer chromatography. Within 90 s, when the thrombin-dependent degradation of total [3H] phosphatidylinositol amounted to 49.5%, the percentage loss of radioactivity from the tetraenoic (1-stearoyl 2-arachidonoyl) species and greater than tetraenes was significantly greater than that for the other molecular classes and approximately twice that for the monoenes. Furthermore, the extent of degradation tended to decrease with decreasing unsaturation of the phosphatidylinositols in intact platelets. These results indicate that the thrombin-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol in intact human platelets exhibits a preferential degradation of 1-acyl (predominantly stearoyl plus oleoyl) 2-arachidonoyl species relative to other molecular species which may possibly be of importance in platelet aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W1520031956,"The calculated rate of protein synthesis for growing Tetrahymena is 360 pg/h, whereas starved cells synthesize only about 3 pg of protein/h. Within 50 min after deciliation of starved cells, the rate of protein synthesis increases to about 60 pg/h. The major mechanism to accomplish these large and rapid changes in the rate of bulk protein synthesis involves regulation of the number of messages loaded on polysomes. Logarithmically growing cells contain about 3.2 X 10(7) mRNA molecules/cell, of which approximately 60% is loaded on polysomes. Starved cells contain about 0.8 X 10(7) messages and the percentage of messages loaded is reduced to 4%. Thus, the number of loaded messages is approximately 60-fold lower in starved cells than in growing cells, although the total message content of cells in these two physiological states differs by only a factor of 4. After deciliation of starved cells, message loading increases about 10-fold. It seems likely that much of the message loaded after deciliation is derived from the large pool of nonpolysomal message in starved cells. Although large differences in message loading exist for growing, starved, and starved-deciliated cells, measurements of the rate of polypeptide elongation and the rate of message initiation indicate the translational efficiency of loaded messages (pg of protein synthesized per pg of message/unit time) is very similar under all conditions."

https://openalex.org/W7134720,"The three dissimilar subunits of pig heart DPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, which normally occur in the ratio 2 alpha:1 beta:1 gamma, have been separated by chromatofocusing. The subunits were first dissociated from native enzyme (specific activity, 15-20 units/mg) with minimal unfolding in 2 M urea and chromatofocused in the range pH 8-5 in the presence of 1 M urea. Isolated alpha, beta, and gamma subunits had specific activities of 0.4, 0.04, and less than 0.01 unit/mg, respectively, suggesting that at least 3 of the 4 subunits of the alpha 2 beta gamma tetramer contain elements of the catalytic site. Addition of pairs of subunits to assay mixtures resulted in markedly enhanced activity for alpha plus gamma (specific activity, 7.8 units/mg) and alpha plus beta (2.9 units/mg), but not for beta plus gamma. The subunit concentration dependence of enhanced activity indicated formation of stoichiometric alpha beta and alpha gamma complexes. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments revealed that alpha, as isolated, exists primarily as a dimer, while beta and gamma are monomeric. The combinations of alpha and beta and alpha and gamma are dimers. Under the conditions used, no larger complexes were formed when all 3 subunits were added in the ratio (2 alpha:1 beta:1 gamma) found in native enzyme and these mixtures failed to show increased activity above that found with alpha beta and alpha gamma. Native enzyme exhibits a reduced Km for the substrate, isocitrate, in the presence of ADP, but this allosteric effect was not observed for the isolated subunits or for combinations of alpha with beta or gamma. However, ADP binding to isolated alpha and beta subunits as well as to alpha beta and alpha gamma dimers was only slightly reduced from that of native enzyme. These results indicate that although all subunits may have the elements of the catalytic and allosteric sites, optimum activity and regulatory properties may require the association of dissimilar subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1611428061,"Several sialic acid-containing glycolipids have been isolated and purified from murine thymus. Eleven of these acidic glycolipids (gangliosides) have been analyzed by several techniques, permitting us to propose a tentative structure for each. Sugar analysis reveals that all 11 gangliosides contain the same base structure, Gal(beta 1-3)GalNAc(beta 1-4)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc(beta 1-1) ceramide, which is gangliotetraosylceramide. No glucosamine or fucose is present in glycolipids from this tissue. There appears to be considerable heterogeneity in the sialic acid moiety of these gangliosides with respect to their structures and linkages. One ganglioside contains only N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Four of the gangliosides are common brain-type structures and contain sialic acid linked to internal galactose which is insusceptible to Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. In addition, four of the gangliosides are susceptible to base hydrolysis and are believed to contain O-acetyl derivatives of sialic acid. Two gangliosides have also been shown to contain both N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminic acid. There is also heterogeneity within the ceramide portion of some gangliosides which may be responsible for the appearance of an additional three ganglioside bands on thin layer chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1564490330,"Evidence is presented that monensin-sensitive membranes, presumably the Golgi apparatus, are involved in the synthesis of hyaluronate in rat fibrosarcoma cells. Monensin caused the inhibition of incorporation of metabolic precursors into hyaluronate produced by rat fibrosarcoma cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Maximum inhibition (70-80%) was obtained on treatment with 10(-7) M monensin for 24 h. Incorporation of label into secreted hyaluronate and into that associated with the cell surface was inhibited, but incorporation into intracellular hyaluronate was not inhibited. In 3T3 cells, treatment for 24 h with 10(-7) M monensin inhibited incorporation of label only into secreted hyaluronate. The hyaluronate-rich pericellular coat, revealed by exclusion of fixed red blood cells, was depleted on treatment with monensin under the same conditions which caused inhibition of hyaluronate synthesis in the fibrosarcoma cells. Cell proliferation, as measured by DNA content/culture and [3H]thymidine incorporation, was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by monensin (10(-8)-10(-6) M). Protein synthesis was not inhibited at these doses, nor was monensin cytotoxic as judged by a 51Cr release assay. The inhibition of hyaluronate synthesis was independent of the antiproliferative effect of monensin because it was obtained during log phase growth or confluency and in the presence or in the absence of serum."
https://openalex.org/W1673289895,"In previous experiments, three pepsin-resistant fragments of type IV collagen were isolated from chicken gizzards and designated 7S, F3, and (F1)2F2 (Mayne, R., and Zettergren, J.

In the present experiments, a series of monoclonal antibodies to type IV collagen were prepared, each one of which recognized an epitope present in only one of the three fragments. A high molecular weight fraction of type IV collagen (designated 7S + arms (215 nm)) was isolated after agarose gel filtration and characterized by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing and by gel electrophoresis. Analysis of 7S + arms (215 nm) by inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated the presence of the epitopes for 7S and F3 but not for (F1)2F2.

https://openalex.org/W1485795574,"5-(iodoacetamidoethyl)aminonaphthalene-l-sulfonic acid covalently attached to one thiol by the acceptor 5- (iodoacetamido)fluorescein linked to the other. Com- parable results were obtained from measurements of acceptor sensitization. When the donor was attached to SH1 and the acceptor to SH2, the mean donor-acceptor separation based on the assumption of isotropic and rapid random orientation of both attached probes (R(2/ 3)) is 46 A. Since the orientational freedom of both probes was partially restricted, lower and upper bounds of R were calculated from the observed transfer data and depolarization factors determined from do- nor- and acceptor-labeled proteins. The mean lower bound (R(min)) is 29 and the mean upper bound (R(max)) is 76 A. Of these three distance parameters, R(2/3) and R(max) may be ruled out on structural grounds since the two thiols are known to be only 10 residues apart in the primary structure of the heavy chain. Slightly smaller values of these parameters were obtained when the donor and acceptor locations were switched. Addition of F-actin reduced R(min) by 5 A, whereas MgADP had no detectable effect on the mini- mum separation. Quenching of the donor emission by acrylamide was investigated by both the steady state and nanosecond methods. Evidence was obtained that the emission of the covalently attached donor contained two components. Resolution of the lifetimes was facil- itated by the presence of acrylamide. The quenching of this emission is attributed to collisional quenching. MgADP reduced the quenching when the donor was located at the SH1 thiol, but it had no effect on the quenching when attached to the SH2 site. The donor attached to SH1 was also quenched by iodide and the quenching pattern was compatible with multiple emis- sion components."
https://openalex.org/W1577456488,"Resonance Raman data from deoxy hemoglobin and photodissociated carbonmonoxy hemoglobin (Hb*) at low temperature (10 K) are reported. At this temperature with 457.9 nm excitation, the iron-histidine (Fe-His) stretching mode in deoxy hemoglobin disappears, although with 441.6 nm excitation it is detected at 235 cm-1. The intensity change is interpreted as resulting from changes in energy of iron d orbitals induced by the shortening of the Fe-His bond on temperature reduction. The previously reported narrowing of the Fe-His mode with temperature reduction has been found to be artifact. In Hb*, the Fe-His stretching mode is present with 457.9 nm as well as 441.6 nm excitation and is at higher frequency (242-244 cm-1) than it is in the deoxy samples. Several porphyrin skeletal frequencies are also shifted in Hb* with respect to deoxy hemoglobin. These data are interpreted as resulting from perturbations on the ligand-free histidine-porphyrin complex by the liganded conformation of the heme pocket. We find no evidence that the dissociated CO molecule interacts with the heme in Hb*."
https://openalex.org/W1484050704,"Transimination of the enzyme-linked cofactor by an amino acid is the first chemical transformation in the reactions catalyzed by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-requiring enzymes. In this work, stopped flow fluorimetry was used to characterize the kinetics of transimination of the cofactor in D-serine dehydratase by several amino acids. The results of these studies indicate that transimination is a multistep process, the first step of which is probably formation of a noncovalent complex between the enzyme and the amino acid. D-Serine dehydratase was found to exhibit considerable specificity in the transimination reaction. Furthermore, the enzyme was shown to facilitate the transimination reaction with amino acids and inhibit transimination of the bound cofactor by amines lacking a carboxylate group. A reaction pathway was proposed for the transimination process which accounts for the specificity of the enzyme and indicates the changes in the conformation of the bound cofactor as dictated by the stereoelectronic requirements of the transimination reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1588858707,"Phase-sensitive detection of fluorescence was used to measure the fractional binding of an amphipathic derivative of indole to detergent micelles. By selection of the detector phase angle, the emissions from the free and bound indole could be individually suppressed. The phase-sensitive intensity was then proportional to the concentrations of the bound and free indole, respectively. Also, the ratio of the phase-sensitive intensities, recorded at the phase angles for suppression, revealed the ratio of the fluorophore present in each environment. As the detergent concentration was increased, the measurements revealed a cooperative formation of detergent micelles and binding of the indole derivative to these micelles. The theory and procedures for this specific analysis can be applied to the analysis of any association reaction in which one of the species is fluorescent, and in which the fluorescence lifetime is altered by the binding process. An advantage of this procedure is that binding can be quantified without physical separation of the individual species."

The alpha 2D-reactive epitope requires at least two proteolytic events for expression, and the alpha 2E-reactive epitope is expressed following the initial cleavage catalyzed by thrombin. In addition, the alpha 2E-reactive epitope is expressed upon the addition of chelators to Factor V. However, the alpha 2D epitope is not influenced by the removal of calcium ions. The interactions of these antibodies with Factor V and Factor V-derived peptides suggest that conformational changes occur in both the NH2-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of Factor V concomitant with activation by thrombin, which give rise to the antibody recognition sites."
https://openalex.org/W1517073391,"The reaction of 2-thioriboflavin (sulfur replacing the oxygen substituent at position 2 alpha) with hydrogen peroxide at pH approximately 10 leads to a blue flavin (lambda max = 565 nm) which was purified in stable, homogeneous form. Titrations of 2-thioflavins with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid also yield the same blue flavins with consumption of 1 eq of peracid. Anaerobic reduction of the blue flavin by sodium dithionite requires 4e- eq, and leads to formation of 1,5-dihydro-2-thioflavin. Oxidation of the latter with O2 restores the original 2-thioflavin. pH titration of the blue flavin shows two pKa values of 2.4 and 6.6, with no apparent ionization in the pH range 8-11. These results suggest that the blue flavin is a flavin 2-S-oxide. The visible absorption spectra of flavin 2-S-oxides show a pronounced dependence on solvent polarity. This property suggests that these flavin analogs may be useful hydrophilic/hydrophobic probes of flavoprotein active sites. Flavin 2-S-oxides can be oxidized further to the 2-sulfinate and 2-sulfonate analogs, some properties of which are described."
https://openalex.org/W1547499385,"Methylation of proteins was studied in intact rat posterior pituitary lobes in vitro. Posterior pituitary lobes can catalyze the formation of protein carboxylmethyl esters using methionine as a precursor. Methylation inhibitors inhibited formation of protein carboxylmethyl esters, indicating that the reaction proceeded via an enzymatic methylation pathway. At least six proteins were methylated in the intact lobe. Among these are the neurophysins as identified by their characteristic properties: molecular weight, [35S]cysteine labeling, disappearance after salt loading or pituitary stalk section, and low levels in the homozygous Brattleboro rat. Other still unidentified proteins of molecular weight lower than 21,000 were also methylated. Their disappearance after pituitary section and salt loading indicates that, like the neurophysins, these proteins are localized within the hypothalamoneuro-hypophysial axon terminals."
https://openalex.org/W1596870095,"4-Azidophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and 4-diazophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside were used to inactivate ricin. Galactose, but not glucose, protected against inactivation as measured by the retention of the ability of ricin to bind to Bio-Gel A, a galactose-containing gel. Nearly complete inhibition of binding to Bio-Gel A, to monosaccharides, or to cell surface receptors could be achieved by reaction of ricin with either label, but neither label impaired the ability of the A chain to inhibit translation in vitro. The diazonium salt-modified ricin still inhibited cellular protein synthesis, but ricin modified by the photoactivated label was 280 times less efficient than ricin in inhibition of cellular protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1521951774,"A previous report from this laboratory (Birnbaum R. S., O'Neil, J. A., Muszynski, M., Aron, D. C., and Roos, B. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 241-244) provided immunochemical and biochemical evidence for the existence of a secretory peptide derived from the noncalcitonin region of rat preprocalcitonin. By a variety of criteria, we demonstrated that this naturally occurring peptide was similar, if not identical, to a synthetic peptide which consisted of the NH2-terminal 16 residues of the calcitonin mRNA translation product. We have now purified this peptide from rat medullary thyroid carcinoma and sequenced it. A rat tumor of the 1-2-4 tumor series was extracted in 0.1 N HCl yielding 900 micrograms of immunoreactive peptide. The peptide was purified to homogeneity by: 1) trichloroacetic acid precipitation of contaminating protein; 2) gel filtration; and finally, 3) reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Overall yield was approximately 24%. Amino acid analysis and sequencing of the peptide yielded a composition and sequence identical with that of the synthetic peptide."

https://openalex.org/W1547366865,"Endoribonuclease VII, a novel endoribonuclease from calf thymus, was identified and purified by us. The purified enzyme has Mr = 74,000; its homogeneity was checked by analysis in polyacrylamide gels (both in the presence and in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate). The nuclease cleaves poly(U) and poly(C) while other single-stranded homopolyribo- as well as polydeoxyribonucleotides are not degraded; poly(A,C) is hydrolyzed to a smaller extent, while poly(U) X poly(A) is not degraded at all. Poly(A) modulates the poly(U)-degrading activity; at a molar ratio of approximately 1 [poly(A)]:10 [poly(U)], a more than 100% stimulation of the enzyme activity was achieved, while at lower ratios an almost complete inhibition of the enzyme activity resulted. Binding studies revealed that endoribonuclease VII has a marked affinity for poly(A) and poly(U). During hydrolysis, oligo(U)12 fragments with 3'-OH and 5'-P termini are formed. The basic enzyme (pI = 8.5) has its activity optimum at pH 7.2, requiring neither monovalent nor divalent cations; the enzyme is not inhibited by thiol group reagents. Several lines of evidence suggesting a role of endoribonuclease VII in mRNA processing are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1561818819,"The influence of pH and state of polymerization on the site of attachment of the fluorophore 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) to actin was examined. Possible interference of buffer constituents which react with NBD-Cl was also observed. F-actin is primarily labeled at cysteine below pH 6.5 and at lysine at values of pH above neutrality. Time dependences of the excitation spectra support the contention that NBD-Cl may react first with cysteine and then undergo transfer to a neighboring lysine. The quantum yield enhancement of NBD bound to cysteine upon polymerization is markedly less than the 2-fold increase observed when it is bound to lysine. Labeling reactions carried out with G-actin give predominantly the lysine derivative regardless of pH. NBD-Cl was found to react with a number of the constituents of buffer systems normally employed with actin. The spectra of these reaction products are sufficiently similar to those of the NBD-amino acid derivatives to require care when interpreting reaction rate data by spectrophotometric or fluorometric methods."
https://openalex.org/W1607950302,"Hydrogen peroxide reacts with 2-thio-FAD-reconstituted p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase to yield a long wavelength intermediate (lambda max = 360, 620 nm) which can be isolated in stable form on removal of excess H2O2. The blue flavin derivative slowly decays in a second peroxide-dependent reaction to yield a new flavin product lacking long wavelength absorbance (lambda max = 408, 472 nm). This final peroxide-modified enzyme binds p-hydroxybenzoate with a 10-fold lower affinity than does the native enzyme; furthermore, substrate binding leads to the inhibition of enzyme reduction by NADPH. Trichloroacetic acid treatment of the final peroxide-modified enzyme results in the quantitative conversion of the bound flavin to free FAD. However, gel filtration of the modified enzyme in guanidine hydrochloride at neutral pH leads to the co-elution of protein and modified flavin. The nondenatured peroxide product reacts rapidly with hydroxylamine to yield 2-NHOH-substituted FAD. These observations indicate that the secondary reaction of peroxide with the blue intermediate from 2-thio-FAD p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase results in the formation of an acid-labile covalent flavin-protein linkage within the enzyme active site, involving the flavin C-2 position."
https://openalex.org/W2129326043,"Plots of reciprocal initial rate of formaldehyde formation as a function of reciprocal ethylmorphine concentration provide parallel lines for oxygen concentrations ranging from 5.41 to 211 microM, and the apparent Km values for ethylmorphine at these extremes are 167 and 417 microM, respectively. Similarly, the apparent Km for O2 decreases from 7.69 microM at 2 mM ethylmorphine to 3.64 microM at 0.2 mM ethylmorphine. Reciprocal plots of 1/Km app and 1/Vm for ethylmorphine against 1/[O2] give Km values for O2 of 9.35 microM and 9.09 microM, respectively. Similar plots give Km values for ethylmorphine of 0.28 mM and 0.36 mM. Similarly, NADH causes an uncompetitive stimulation. These data suggest that hepatic microsomal ethylmorphine N-demethylase follows parallel plot sequential kinetics. These results, along with studies of other workers, suggest that cytochrome P-450 forms an active complex with O2 which is stable for at least many milliseconds."
https://openalex.org/W1561750129,"The role of AMP in photophosphorylation was studied using rapid mixing acid quench techniques. Fragmented spinach chloroplast membranes or subchloroplast particles were illuminated and rapidly mixed with [32P]orthophosphate and AMP at pH 7 for 10 ms to 60 s after which time perchloric acid was added to quench the reaction. ATP was found to be the primary and predominant nucleotide labeled. It was found that after illumination, an adenylate kinase-like activity carried out an AMP-dependent conversion of labeled ATP to labeled ADP which was inhibited by the presence of ADP. This reaction was characterized as being similar to chloroplast adenylate kinase in Mg2+ dependency and in sensitivity to phlorizin and tentoxin and distinct from chloroplast coupling factor 1. The small amounts of adenylate kinase activity present in fragmented well washed chloroplast membranes were found to be sufficient to carry out this rapid reaction. These results necessitated a reinterpretation of the earlier findings of Tiefert and Moudrianakis (Tiefert, M.A., and Moudrianakis, E.N. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9500-9508) and no longer support the role of ADP as a phosphorylated intermediate in ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1479962737,"Immunoprecipitation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase formed by translation of rat liver RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free protein synthesis system was used to examine the origin of the molecular weight heterogeneity of the enzyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated products showed that in most cases a single specifically immunoprecipitated polypeptide was produced which corresponded to the higher molecular weight (H) form of phenylalanine hydroxylase (Mr = 50,000). The identity of the product was confirmed by immunological competition and peptide mapping. RNA from other rats, however, coded for both the H-form and the lower molecular weight (L) form of phenylalanine hydroxylase or for only the L-form. The evidence suggests that the L-form derives from a different mRNA, rather than by proteolysis of the H-form, an interpretation which is supported by the isolation of the lower form of phenylalanine hydroxylase from livers of some rats."
