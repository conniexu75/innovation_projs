https://openalex.org/W2803072880,"Horizontal pleiotropy occurs when the variant has an effect on disease outside of its effect on the exposure in Mendelian randomization (MR). Violation of the 'no horizontal pleiotropy' assumption can cause severe bias in MR. We developed the Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test to identify horizontal pleiotropic outliers in multi-instrument summary-level MR testing. We showed using simulations that the MR-PRESSO test is best suited when horizontal pleiotropy occurs in <50% of instruments. Next we applied the MR-PRESSO test, along with several other MR tests, to complex traits and diseases and found that horizontal pleiotropy (i) was detectable in over 48% of significant causal relationships in MR; (ii) introduced distortions in the causal estimates in MR that ranged on average from -131% to 201%; (iii) induced false-positive causal relationships in up to 10% of relationships; and (iv) could be corrected in some but not all instances."
https://openalex.org/W2801651204,"Although most activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are sensitive to available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a subset with alterations in exon 20 of EGFR and HER2 are intrinsically resistant and lack an effective therapy. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo testing to model structural alterations induced by exon 20 mutations and to identify effective inhibitors. 3D modeling indicated alterations restricted the size of the drug-binding pocket, limiting the binding of large, rigid inhibitors. We found that poziotinib, owing to its small size and flexibility, can circumvent these steric changes and is a potent inhibitor of the most common EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutants. Poziotinib demonstrated greater activity than approved EGFR TKIs in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models of EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutant NSCLC and in genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC. In a phase 2 trial, the first 11 patients with NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations receiving poziotinib had a confirmed objective response rate of 64%. These data identify poziotinib as a potent, clinically active inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutations and illuminate the molecular features of TKIs that may circumvent steric changes induced by these mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2952922105,"To understand how genomic heterogeneity of glioblastoma (GBM) contributes to poor therapy response, we performed DNA and RNA sequencing on GBM samples and the neurospheres and orthotopic xenograft models derived from them. We used the resulting dataset to show that somatic driver alterations including single-nucleotide variants, focal DNA alterations and oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) elements were in majority propagated from tumor to model systems. In several instances, ecDNAs and chromosomal alterations demonstrated divergent inheritance patterns and clonal selection dynamics during cell culture and xenografting. We infer that ecDNA was unevenly inherited by offspring cells, a characteristic that affects the oncogenic potential of cells with more or fewer ecDNAs. Longitudinal patient tumor profiling found that oncogenic ecDNAs are frequently retained throughout the course of disease. Our analysis shows that extrachromosomal elements allow rapid increase of genomic heterogeneity during GBM evolution, independently of chromosomal DNA alterations. Analysis of glioblastoma samples and derived neurospheres and xenografts shows that chromosomal and extrachromosomal alterations often display divergent inheritance patterns during cell culture and xenografting."
https://openalex.org/W2802771436,"Experience results in long-lasting changes in dendritic spine size, yet how the molecular architecture of the synapse responds to plasticity remains poorly understood. Here a combined approach of multicolor stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) and confocal imaging in rat and mouse demonstrates that structural plasticity is linked to the addition of unitary synaptic nanomodules to spines. Spine synapses in vivo and in vitro contain discrete and aligned subdiffraction modules of pre- and postsynaptic proteins whose number scales linearly with spine size. Live-cell time-lapse super-resolution imaging reveals that NMDA receptor–dependent increases in spine size are accompanied both by enhanced mobility of pre- and postsynaptic modules that remain aligned with each other and by a coordinated increase in the number of nanomodules. These findings suggest a simplified model for experience-dependent structural plasticity relying on an unexpectedly modular nanomolecular architecture of synaptic proteins. Hruska et al. suggest an architectural basis for NMDAR-dependent spine plasticity mediated by addition of unitary pre- and postsynaptic nanomodules that function as building blocks of synaptic organization and enable structural plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2801515322,"T cells create vast amounts of diversity in the genes that encode their T cell receptors (TCRs), which enables individual clones to recognize specific peptide–major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligands. Here we combined sequencing of the TCR-encoding genes with assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) analysis at the single-cell level to provide information on the TCR specificity and epigenomic state of individual T cells. By using this approach, termed transcript-indexed ATAC-seq (T-ATAC-seq), we identified epigenomic signatures in immortalized leukemic T cells, primary human T cells from healthy volunteers and primary leukemic T cells from patient samples. In peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from healthy individuals, we identified cis and trans regulators of naive and memory T cell states and found substantial heterogeneity in surface-marker-defined T cell populations. In patients with a leukemic form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, T-ATAC-seq enabled identification of leukemic and nonleukemic regulatory pathways in T cells from the same individual by allowing separation of the signals that arose from the malignant clone from the background T cell noise. Thus, T-ATAC-seq is a new tool that enables analysis of epigenomic landscapes in clonal T cells and should be valuable for studies of T cell malignancy, immunity and immunotherapy. A new technique enabling single-cell analysis of T cell receptor identity and epigenomic state uncovers heterogeneity in normal and leukemic T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2802232175,"Despite suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), latent HIV-1 proviruses persist in patients. This latent reservoir is established within 48-72 h after infection, has a long half-life1,2, enables viral rebound when ART is interrupted, and is the major barrier to a cure for HIV-1 3 . Latent cells are exceedingly rare in blood (∼1 per 1 × 106 CD4+ T cells) and are typically enumerated by indirect means, such as viral outgrowth assays4,5. We report a new strategy to purify and characterize single reactivated latent cells from HIV-1-infected individuals on suppressive ART. Surface expression of viral envelope protein was used to enrich reactivated latent T cells producing HIV RNA, and single-cell analysis was performed to identify intact virus. Reactivated latent cells produce full-length viruses that are identical to those found in viral outgrowth cultures and represent clones of in vivo expanded T cells, as determined by their T cell receptor sequence. Gene-expression analysis revealed that these cells share a transcriptional profile that includes expression of genes implicated in silencing the virus. We conclude that reactivated latent T cells isolated from blood can share a gene-expression program that allows for cell division without activation of the cell death pathways that are normally triggered by HIV-1 replication."
https://openalex.org/W2743269523,"The emergence of catalysis in a noncatalytic protein scaffold is a rare, unexplored event. Chalcone isomerase (CHI), a key enzyme in plant flavonoid biosynthesis, is presumed to have evolved from a nonenzymatic ancestor related to the widely distributed fatty-acid binding proteins (FAPs) and a plant protein family with no isomerase activity (CHILs). Ancestral inference supported the evolution of CHI from a protein lacking isomerase activity. Further, we identified four alternative founder mutations, i.e., mutations that individually instated activity, including a mutation that is not phylogenetically traceable. Despite strong epistasis in other cases of protein evolution, CHI's laboratory reconstructed mutational trajectory shows weak epistasis. Thus, enantioselective CHI activity could readily emerge despite a catalytically inactive starting point. Accordingly, X-ray crystallography, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal reshaping of the active site toward a productive substrate-binding mode and repositioning of the catalytic arginine that was inherited from the ancestral fatty-acid binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2801869326,"Direct visualization and light control of several cellular processes is a challenge, owing to the spectral overlap of available genetically encoded probes. Here we report the most red-shifted monomeric near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent protein, miRFP720, and the fully NIR Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair miRFP670–miRFP720, which together enabled design of biosensors compatible with CFP–YFP imaging and blue–green optogenetic tools. We developed a NIR biosensor for Rac1 GTPase and demonstrated its use in multiplexed imaging and light control of Rho GTPase signaling pathways. Specifically, we combined the Rac1 biosensor with CFP–YFP FRET biosensors for RhoA and for Rac1–GDI binding, and concurrently used the LOV-TRAP tool for upstream Rac1 activation. We directly observed and quantified antagonism between RhoA and Rac1 dependent on the RhoA-downstream effector ROCK; showed that Rac1 activity and GDI binding closely depend on the spatiotemporal coordination between these two molecules; and simultaneously observed Rac1 activity during optogenetic manipulation of Rac1. The monomeric near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent protein miRFP720 enables development of fully NIR Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors compatible with CFP–YFP FRET biosensors and blue–green optogenetic tools without optical cross-talk."

https://openalex.org/W2799310339,"Working memory capacity is pivotal for a broad specter of cognitive tasks and develops throughout childhood. This must in part rely on development of neural connections and white matter microstructure maturation, but there is scarce knowledge of specific relations between this and different aspects of working memory. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables us to study development of brain white matter microstructure. In a longitudinal DTI study of 148 healthy children between 4 and 11 years scanned twice with an on average 1.6 years interval, we characterized change in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), radial (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in 10 major white matter tracts hypothesized to be of importance for working memory. The results showed relationships between change in several tracts and change in visuospatial working memory. Specifically, improvement in visuospatial working memory capacity was significantly associated with decreased MD, RD and AD in inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and uncinate fasciculus (UF) in the right hemisphere, as well as forceps major (FMaj). No significant relationships were found between change in DTI metrics and change in verbal working memory capacity. These findings yield new knowledge about brain development and corresponding working memory improvements in childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2800483169,"Globally, anthropogenic environmental change is exacerbating the already vulnerable conditions of many people and ecosystems. In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement). A better understanding of the context and impacts of local ecosystem-based adaptation is fundamental to the scaling up of land management policies and practices designed to reduce risks and improve well-being for people at different scales."
https://openalex.org/W2799492423,"Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are important post-translational regulatory mechanisms responsible for fine tuning the antiviral signaling. In this study, we identified a deubiquitinase, the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7/herpes virus associated ubiquitin-specific protease (USP7/HAUSP) as an important negative modulator of virus-induced signaling. Overexpression of USP7 suppressed Sendai virus and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and poly(deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic)-induced ISRE and IFN-β activation, and enhanced virus replication. Knockdown or knockout of endogenous USP7 expression had the opposite effect. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that USP7 physically interacted with tripartite motif (TRIM)27. This interaction was enhanced after SeV infection. In addition, TNF receptor-associated factor family member-associated NF-kappa-B-binding kinase (TBK)-1 was pulled down in the TRIM27-USP7 complex. Overexpression of USP7 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1 through promoting the stability of TRIM27. Knockout of endogenous USP7 led to enhanced TRIM27 degradation and reduced TBK1 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in enhanced type I IFN signaling. Our findings suggest that USP7 acts as a negative regulator in antiviral signaling by stabilizing TRIM27 and promoting the degradation of TBK1.—Cai, J., Chen, H.-Y., Peng, S.-J., Meng, J.-L., Wang, Y., Zhou, Y., Qian, X.-P., Sun, X.-Y., Pang, X.-W., Zhang, Y., Zhang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2800919875,"Production and degradation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are extensively regulated to ensure proper cellular responses to various environmental stimuli and stresses. Moreover, physiologically generated ROS function as secondary messengers that can influence tissue homeostasis. The cap'n'collar transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2 (Nrf2) coordinates an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional activation pathway that mediates antioxidant and detoxification responses in many animal species, including insects and mammals. Here, we show that Nrf2-mediated signaling affects embryo survival, midgut homeostasis, and redox biology in Aedes aegypti, a mosquito species vector of dengue, Zika, and other disease-causing viruses. We observed that AeNrf2 silencing increases ROS levels and stimulates intestinal stem cell proliferation. Because ROS production is a major aspect of innate immunity in mosquito gut, we found that a decrease in Nrf2 signaling results in reduced microbiota growth and Zika virus infection. Moreover, we provide evidence that AeNrf2 signaling also controls transcriptional adaptation of A. aegypti to insecticide challenge. Therefore, we conclude that Nrf2-mediated response regulates assorted gene clusters in A. aegypti that determine cellular and midgut redox balance, affecting overall xenobiotic resistance and vectorial adaptation of the mosquito."
https://openalex.org/W2801093696,"Neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with aberrant mitochondrial function in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. An association has been reported between PD onset and exposure to mitochondrial toxins, including the agrochemicals paraquat (PQ), maneb (MB), and rotenone (Rot). Here, with the use of a patient-derived stem cell model of PD, allowing comparison of DA neurons harboring a mutation in the α-synuclein (α-syn) gene ( SNCA-A53T) against isogenic, mutation-corrected controls, we describe a novel mechanism whereby NO, generated from SNCA-A53T mutant neurons exposed to Rot or PQ/MB, inhibits anterograde mitochondrial transport through nitration of α-tubulin (α-Tub). Nitration of α-Tub inhibited the association of both α-syn and the mitochondrial motor protein kinesin 5B with the microtubules, arresting anterograde transport. This was, in part, a result of nitration of α-Tub in the C-terminal domain. These effects were rescued by inhibiting NO synthesis with the NOS inhibitor Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Collectively, our results are the first to demonstrate a gene by environment interaction in PD, whereby agrochemical exposure selectively triggers a deficit in mitochondrial transport by nitrating the microtubules in neurons harboring the SNCA-A53T mutation.-Stykel, M. G., Humphries, K., Kirby, M. P., Czaniecki, C., Wang, T., Ryan, T., Bamm, V., Ryan, S. D.

https://openalex.org/W2799990636,"Zinc is an essential micronutrient required for proper structure and function of many proteins. Bacteria regularly encounter zinc depletion and have evolved diverse mechanisms to continue growth when zinc is limited, including the expression of zinc-independent paralogs of zinc-binding proteins. Mycobacteria have a conserved operon encoding four zinc-independent alternative ribosomal proteins (AltRPs) that are expressed when zinc is depleted. It is unknown if mycobacterial AltRPs replace their primary paralogs in the ribosome and maintain protein synthesis under zinc-limited conditions, and if such replacements contribute to their physiology. This study shows that AltRPs from Mycobacterium smegmatis are essential for growth when zinc ion is scarce. Specifically, the deletion mutant of this operon (ΔaltRP) is unable to grow in media containing a high-affinity zinc chelator, while growth of the wild type strain is unaffected under the same conditions. However, when zinc is gradually depleted during growth in zinc-limited medium, the ΔaltRP mutant maintains the same growth rate as seen for the wild type strain. In contrast to M. smegmatis grown with sufficient zinc supplementation that forms shorter cells when transitioning from logarithmic to stationary phase, M. smegmatis deficient for zinc elongates after the expression of AltRPs in late logarithmic phase. These zinc-depleted bacteria also exhibit a remarkable morphology characterized by a condensed chromosome, increased number of polyphosphate granules, and distinct appearance of lipid bodies and the cell wall compared to the zinc-replete cells. However, the ΔaltRP cells fail to elongate and transition into the zinc-limited morphotype, resembling the wild type zinc-replete bacteria instead. Therefore, the altRP operon in M. smegmatis has a vital role in continuation of growth when zinc is scarce and in triggering specific morphogenesis during the adaptation to zinc limitation, suggesting that AltRPs can functionally replace their zinc-dependent paralogs, but also contribute to mycobacterial physiology in a unique way."
https://openalex.org/W2800482634,"The tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) plays a central role in regulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, and its gene is very frequently mutated in various human cancers. Numerous studies have revealed that PTEN levels are tightly regulated by both transcriptional and posttranslational modifications, with especially ubiquitylation significantly regulating PTEN protein levels. Although several ubiquitin ligases have been reported to mediate PTEN ubiquitylation in vitro, the ubiquitin ligase that promotes PTEN degradation in vivo has not been reported. Here we took advantage of specific knockout mouse models to demonstrate that WW domain–containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (WWP2) promotes PTEN degradation under physiological conditions, whereas another ubiquitin ligase, carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), had no such effect. WWP2 knockout mice exhibited reduced body size, elevated PTEN protein levels, and reduced phosphorylation levels of the serine/threonine kinase and PTEN target AKT. In contrast, we observed no elevation of PTEN protein levels in CHIP knockout tissues and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, PTEN protein levels in CHIP/WWP2 double knockout mice were very similar to those in WWP2 single knockout mice and significantly higher than in WT and CHIP knockout mice. Our results demonstrate that WWP2, rather than CHIP, is an ubiquitin ligase that promotes PTEN degradation in vivo. Considering PTEN’s significant role in tumor development, we propose that WWP2 may be a potential target for fine-tuning PTEN levels in anticancer therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2952998373,"Neuropeptides commonly signal by metabotropic GPCRs. In some mollusks and cnidarians, RFamide neuropeptides mediate fast ionotropic signaling by peptide-gated ion channels that belong to the DEG/ENaC family. Here we describe a neuropeptide system with a dual mode of signaling by both a peptide-gated ion channel and a GPCR. We identified and characterized a peptide-gated channel in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii that is specifically activated by Wamide myoinhibitory peptides derived from the same proneuropeptide. The myoinhibitory peptide-gated ion channel (MGIC) belongs to the DEG/ENaC family and is paralogous to RFamide-gated ion channels. Platynereis myoinhibitory peptides also activate a previously described GPCR, MAG. We measured the potency of all Wamides on both MGIC and MAG and identified peptides that preferentially activate one or the other receptor. Analysis of a single-cell transcriptome resource indicates that MGIC and MAG signal in distinct target neurons. The identification of a Wamide-gated ion channel suggests that peptide-gated channels are more diverse and widespread in animals than previously appreciated. The possibility of neuropeptide signaling by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to different target cells in the same organism highlights an additional level of complexity in peptidergic signaling networks.-Schmidt, A., Bauknecht, P., Williams, E.

https://openalex.org/W2800198926,"Accumulating evidence demonstrated that NANOG1, the key transcription factor for embryonic stem cells, is associated with human cancers. NANOGP8, one of the pseudogenes in NANOG gene family, contains an intact open reading frame and also said to be expressed in cancer tissues. Therefore, a systematic study is greatly needed to address the following questions: among NANOG1 and NANOGP8, which gene is the main contributor for NANOG expression in cancer cells and which one is the key regulator responsible for stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, chemoresistance and other malignant phenotypes. Here we try to explore these issues with gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro using variety of molecular and cellular techniques.Special primers were designed to distinguish PCR products from NANOG1 and NANOGP8. Sphere-forming cells were cultured with serum-free and selective medium. A stable cell line was established with infection of lentivirus containing NANOGP8. qPCR was performed to measure NANOGP8 expression and its association with stemness, EMT and CSC markers in adherent cells and sphere-forming cells. Western blot analysis was deployed to confirm results of the transcript analysis. Experiments of cell proliferation, migration, invasion, clonogenic assay, sphere cell growth assays, cell cycle analysis, β-catenin accumulation and translocation in nucleus, and drug resistance were conducted to measure the impact of NANOGP8 on malignant statuses of gastric cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining was used to analyze cell subpopulations with different markers.NANOGP8 is mainly responsible for NANOG expression in sphere-forming (stem cell-like) cells derived from gastric cancer cell lines regardless their differentiation status. Ectopic expression of NANOGP8 significantly up-regulates stemness transcription factors, EMT inducers, and cancer stem cell markers (CSC) including Lgr5. NANOGP8 also promotes expression of the signature genes vimentin and N-caderin for mesenchymal cells and down-regulates the signature gene E-caderin for epithelial cells whereby confer the cells with mesenchymal cell phenotype. In NANOGP8 over-expressed adherent and sphere-forming cells, Lgr5+ cells are significantly increased. Ectopic expression of NANOGP8 endows gastric cells with enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion, sphere-forming and clonogenic capacity, and chemoresistance. NANOGP8 expression also enhances β-catenin accumulation in nucleus and strengthens Wnt signal transduction.NANOGP8 is the main regulator of gastric cancer stem cells. It is closely associated with EMT, stemness, and CSC marker as well as Wnt signal pathway. NANOGP8 is correlated with cell proliferation, migration, invasion, clonogenic capacity, β-catenin accumulation in nucleus, and chemoresistance in gastric cancer. NANOGP8 is a promising molecular target for clinical intervention of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2800885510,"The Brazilian sugarcane industry plays an important role in the worldwide supply of sugar and ethanol. Investigation into the genetic structure of current commercial cultivars and comparisons to the main ancestor species allow sugarcane breeding programs to better manage crosses and germplasm banks as well as to promote its rational use. In the present study, the genetic structure of a group of Brazilian cultivars currently grown by commercial producers was assessed through microsatellite markers and contrasted with a group of basic germplasm mainly composed of Saccharum officinarum and S. spontaneum accessions. A total of 285 alleles was obtained by a set of 12 SSRs primer pairs that taken together were able to efficiently distinguish and capture the genetic variability of sugarcane commercial cultivars and basic germplasm accessions allowing its application in a fast and cost-effective way for routine cultivar identification and management of sugarcane germplasm banks. Allelic distribution revealed that 97.6% of the cultivar alleles were found in the basic germplasm while 42% of the basic germplasm alleles were absent in cultivars. Of the absent alleles, 3% was exclusive to S. officinarum, 33% to S. spontaneum and 19% to other species/exotic hybrids. We found strong genetic differentiation between the Brazilian commercial cultivars and the two main species (S. officinarum: [Formula: see text] = 0.211 and S. spontaneum: [Formula: see text] = 0.216, P<0.001), and significant contribution of the latter in the genetic variability of commercial cultivars. Average dissimilarity within cultivars was 1.2 and 1.4 times lower than that within S. officinarum and S. spontaneum. Genetic divergence found between cultivars and S. spontaneum accessions has practical applications for energy cane breeding programs as the choice of more divergent parents will maximize the frequency of transgressive individuals in the progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2949751861,"Plant leaves of different ages differ in nutrients and toxic metabolites and thus exhibit various resistance levels against insect herbivores. However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2799600656,"Mercury (Hg) is deposited from the atmosphere to remote areas such as forests, but the amount of Hg in trees is not well known. To determine the importance of Hg in trees, we analyzed foliage, bark and bole wood of eight tree species at four sites in the northeastern USA (Huntington Forest, NY; Sleepers River, VT; Hubbard Brook, NH; Bear Brook, ME). Foliar concentrations of Hg averaged 16.3 ng g-1 among the hardwood species, which was significantly lower than values in conifers, which averaged 28.6 ng g-1 (p < 0.001). Similarly, bark concentrations of Hg were lower (p < 0.001) in hardwoods (7.7 ng g-1) than conifers (22.5 ng g-1). For wood, concentrations of Hg were higher in yellow birch (2.1-2.8 ng g-1) and white pine (2.3 ng g-1) than in the other species, which averaged 1.4 ng g-1 (p < 0.0001). Sites differed significantly in Hg concentrations of foliage and bark (p = 0.02), which are directly exposed to the atmosphere, but the concentration of Hg in wood depended more on species (p < 0.001) than site (p = 0.60). The Hg contents of tree tissues in hardwood stands, estimated from modeled biomass and measured concentrations at each site, were higher in bark (mean of 0.10 g ha-1) and wood (0.16 g ha-1) than in foliage (0.06 g ha-1). In conifer stands, because foliar concentrations were higher, the foliar pool tended to be more important. Quantifying Hg in tree tissues is essential to understanding the pools and fluxes of Hg in forest ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2799757981,"The purpose of this study is to determine the factors related to anxiety and depression in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The status of anxiety and depression was determined in RP patients with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire which consisted of subscales for HADS-anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS-depression (HADS-D). The vision-specific quality of life (VSQOL) was assessed with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ25). The correlations between the HADS-A or HADS-D scores and vision-related clinical parameters such as the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Functional Acuity Score, Functional Field Score, Functional Vision Score, the NEI- VFQ25 subscale score were determined. The socioeconomic status, such as the work status and membership in the RP society, was investigated to determine the factors related to the HADS-A and HADS-D scores. One hundred and twelve RP patients (46 men and 66 women) with mean age of 60.7±15.4 (standard deviation) years were studied. The HADS-A score was not significantly correlated with any visual functions but was significantly correlated with the general health condition (r = -0.34, P<0.001) and the role limitation (r = -0.20, P = 0.03) of the NEI-VFQ25 subscale. The HADS-D score was significantly correlated with all the visual functions (r = -0.38 to 0.29, P<0.001), the NEI-VFQ25 subscale score (r = - 0.58 to -0.33, P<0.001) by Spearman’s correlations. The HADS-A score was significantly higher in the members of the RP society than in non-members (P = 0.013). The mean HADS-D score of employed individuals was significantly lower than that of unemployed ones (P = 0.001) by the Mann-Whitney U test. The results indicate that visual function impairments and vision-related quality of life are associated with a depressive state, and the general health condition is related to anxiety in RP patients. Being employed may be strongly correlated with the degree of depression in RP patients."

We observed a sustained presence of TGF-β1 at 4 wk in vivo, which significantly promoted structural aspects of early overall cartilage repair, especially cellularity, cellular morphology, and safranin O staining intensity. Furthermore, early aggrecan and type II collagen production were both increased in specific topographic patterns in cartilaginous repair tissue. Sustained release of TGF-β1 also increased cell numbers and proliferation, staining intensities for the stem cell surface marker, CD105, and number of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) -positive cells within cartilaginous repair tissue. These data identify a mechanism by which TGF-β1 modulates early chondrogenesis by primarily increasing the number of progenitor cells arising from the subchondral bone marrow compartment via the SDF-1/chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4 pathway, their proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition in specific topographic patterns, highlighting the pivotal role played by TGF-β1 during this crucial phase.-Asen, A.-K., Goebel, L., Rey-Rico, A., Sohier, J., Zurakowski, D., Cucchiarini, M., Madry, H. Sustained spatiotemporal release of TGF-β1 confers enhanced very early chondrogenic differentiation during osteochondral repair in specific topographic patterns."

The injection of bacterial toxins or protein effectors via this system is accomplished through a plasma membrane channel formed by two bacterial proteins, termed translocators, whose assembly and membrane-insertion mechanisms are currently unclear. Here, using purified proteins we demonstrate that the translocators PopB and PopD in Pseudomonas aeruginosa assemble heterodimers in membranes, leading to stably inserted hetero-complexes. Using site-directed fluorescence labeling with an environment-sensitive probe, we found that hydrophobic segments in PopD anchor the translocator to the membrane, but without adopting a typical transmembrane orientation. A fluorescence dual-quenching assay revealed that the presence of PopB changes the conformation adopted by PopD segments in membranes. Furthermore, analysis of PopD's interaction with human cell membranes revealed that PopD adopts a distinctive conformation when PopB is present. An N-terminal region of PopD is only exposed to the host cytosol when PopB is present. We conclude that PopB assists with the proper insertion of PopD in cell membranes, required for the formation of a functional translocon and host infection.

https://openalex.org/W2799378436,"Objective Polypharmacy is common in older patients but relationships between polypharmacy and common co-morbid conditions have not been elucidated. Our goal was to determine relationships between daily oral medication use and common co-morbid disease dyads and triads using comprehensive medication and diagnostic data from a national sample of nursing homes (NH). Design Retrospective, cross-sectional study. Setting Nationally representative sample of U.S. Nursing Homes. Participants Nationally representative sample of long-term stay residents (n = 11734, 75% women) aged 65 years or older. Measurements Diagnosis and medication data were analyzed. Proportion of daily oral medication intake attributed to treatment of common two-(dyads) and three-disease (triad) combinations and “health maintenance” agents (vitamins, dietary supplements, stool softeners without related diagnoses) was determined. Results Older NH residents received slightly >8 oral medications/day with the number related to number of medical diagnoses (p < .0001). One third of chronic oral medication intake/day (excluding health maintenance agents) could be attributed to dyad combinations and about half to triad combinations despite an average of 5 other diagnoses. Triads were comprised of hypertension +/- arthritis +/- vascular disease, +/-depression, +/- osteoporosis +/- gastroesophageal reflux disease and +/- diabetes. Health maintenance agents accounted for 15–17% of daily oral medication intake (1.4 medications) such that almost two-thirds of daily oral medications were attributable to disease triads plus health maintenance. Fewer medications were prescribed for NH residents over age 85 (decreased ACE inhibitor and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor USE (p < .001)) while use of Alzheimer medications was higher (p < .01). Conclusions A large fraction of daily oral medications were attributed to management of common co-morbid disease dyads and triads. Efforts to reduce polypharmacy and unwanted medication interactions could focus on regimens for common co-morbid dyads and triads in varying populations."
https://openalex.org/W2801517147,"Introduction Most studies on the epidemiology of personality disorders (PDs) have been conducted in high-income countries and may not represent what happens in most part of the world. In the last decades, population growth has been concentrated in low- and middle-income countries, with rapid urbanization, increasing inequalities and escalation of violence. Our aim is to estimate the prevalence of PDs in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, one of the largest megacities of the world. We examined sociodemographic correlates, the influence of urban stressors, the comorbidity with other mental disorders, functional impairment and treatment. Methods A representative household sample of 2,942 adults was interviewed using the WHO-Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the International Personality Disorder Examination-Screening Questionnaire. Diagnoses were multiply imputed, and analyses used multivariable regression. Results and discussion Prevalence estimates were 4.3% (Cluster A), 2.7% (Cluster B), 4.6% (Cluster C) and 6.8% (any PD). Cumulative exposure to violence was associated with all PDs except Cluster A, although urbanicity, migration and neighborhood social deprivation were not significant predictors. Comorbidity was the rule, and all clusters were associated with other mental disorders. Lack of treatment is a reality in Greater Sao Paulo, and this is especially true for PDs. With the exception of Cluster C, non-comorbid PDs remained largely untreated in spite of functional impairment independent of other mental disorders. Conclusion Personality disorders are prevalent, clinically significant and undertreated, and public health strategies must address the unmet needs of these subjects. Our results may reflect what happens in other developing world megacities, and future studies are expected in other low- and middle-income countries."

It has been well documented that, among the different DNA alkylation products, minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine (O2-alkyldT) lesions are inefficiently repaired. In the present study, we examined how seven O2-alkyldT lesions, with the alkyl group being a Me, Et, nPr, iPr, nBu, iBu, or sBu, are recognized by the DNA replication machinery in human cells. We found that the replication bypass efficiencies of these lesions decrease with increasing length of the alkyl chain, and that these lesions induce substantial frequencies of T→A and T→G mutations. Replication experiments using isogenic cells deficient in specific translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases revealed that the absence of polymerase η or polymerase ζ, but not polymerase κ or polymerase ι, significantly decreased both the bypass efficiencies and the mutation frequencies for those O2-alkyldT lesions carrying a straight-chain alkyl group. Moreover, the mutagenic properties of the O2-alkyldT lesions were influenced by the length and topology of the alkyl chain and by TLS polymerases. Together, our results provide important new knowledge about the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of O2-alkyldT lesions, and illustrate the roles of TLS polymerases in replicative bypass of these lesions in human cells.

DNA is intrinsically unstable, where it may undergo spontaneous deamination or depurination under physiological conditions (1Lindahl T.

In addition, endogenous metabolic processes and environmental exposure can give rise to covalent modifications of DNA (2Liu S. Wang Y. Mass spectrometry for the assessment of the occurrence and biological consequences of DNA adducts.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2015; 44 (26204249): 7829-785410.1039/C5CS00316DCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting DNA lesions, if left unrepaired, may compromise genomic integrity by impeding DNA replication and transcription and eliciting mutations in these processes, which may ultimately lead to the development of cancer and other human diseases (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C2006Google Scholar).

Alkylating agents can react with DNA directly or following metabolic activation, which results in the conjugation of DNA with varying sizes of alkyl groups.

Additionally, the three SOS-induced DNA polymerases exert distinct effects on replicative bypass of these lesions, where depletion of Pol V, but not Pol II or Pol IV, elicits significant diminutions in bypass efficiencies of these lesions in E. coli cells. Moreover, both Pol IV and Pol V are essential for the misinsertion of dCMP opposite these lesions, whereas misincorporation of dTMP opposite the lesions requires only Pol V. A recent study by Basu and co-workers (21Weerasooriya S. Jasti V.P. Bose A. Spratt T.E. Basu A.K.

Replication experiments were also performed in the same cells following knockdown of individual translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (21Weerasooriya S. Jasti V.P. Bose A. Spratt T.E. Basu A.K.

However, sometimes unequivocal conclusions about the involvement of a specific TLS polymerase in bypassing a given lesion could not be reached because of the inability of the siRNA technology in depleting completely these polymerases (21Weerasooriya S.

In the present study, we aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding about the recognition of minor-groove O2-alkyldT lesions by DNA replication machinery in human cells. We introduced, into double-stranded plasmids, seven O2-alkyldT lesions with varying sizes and structures of the alkyl group (Fig. 1) and investigated how these lesions impede DNA replication and induce mutations in HEK293T cells. We also assessed the roles of TLS DNA polymerases in bypassing these lesions by conducting replication experiments in the isogenic HEK293T cells where individual TLS polymerases were genetically ablated by the CRISPR/Cas9 method (23Wu J. Li L. Wang P.C. You C.J. Williams N.L. Wang Y.S. Translesion synthesis of O4-alkylthymidine lesions in human cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27466394): 9256-926510.1093/nar/gkw662PubMed Google Scholar). The primary objectives of the present study were to assess comprehensively the extents to which the O2-alkyldT lesions with varying sizes and structures of the alkyl group perturb the efficiencies and fidelities of DNA replication in cultured human cells, and to establish the roles of TLS DNA polymerases in replication past these lesions. We first constructed double-stranded shuttle vectors containing a site-specifically inserted O2-alkyldT lesion, as well as the corresponding nonlesion control vector with an unmodified dT at the lesion site. The lesion-carrying or the undamaged control vectors were mixed individually with the damage-free competitor vector at fixed molar ratios and cotransfected into human cells. The competitor vector, which contains three additional nucleotides relative to the control or lesion-harboring vector, serves as the internal reference for determining the degrees to which the O2-alkyldT lesions block DNA replication in human cells. The progeny genomes were extracted from human cells at 24 h following the transfection, and the residual unreplicated plasmids were removed by treatment with DpnI and exonuclease III. The progeny plasmids were then amplified by PCR using a pair of primers spanning the original lesion site. In this respect, one of the primers (P1) contains a G at the 3′ terminus corresponding to the C/C mismatch site (Fig. 2b), which permits the selective amplification of the progeny genomes arising from the replication of the bottom, lesion-situated strand of the plasmids under suitable conditions (24Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Assays for determining lesion bypass efficiency and mutagenicity of site-specific DNA lesions in vivo.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408 (16793359): 1-1510.1016/S0076-6879(06)08001-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The P1 primer also carries a C/A mismatch three bases from its 3′-end, which improves the specificity of strand-specific PCR, as described elsewhere (25Newton C.R. Graham A. Heptinstall L.E.

Hence, the bypass efficiencies decrease with the chain length for those O2-alkyldT lesions bearing a straight-chain alkyl group. The bypass efficiencies were lower for those O2-alkyldT lesions harboring a branched-chain alkyl group, as reflected by the bypass efficiencies of 34, 14, and 14% for O2-iPrdT, O2-iBudT, and O2-sBudT, respectively (Fig. 4a). These results are reminiscent of previous findings made for the replicative bypass of these lesions in E. coli cells (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y.

We next asked how the replicative bypass of the O2-alkyldT lesions in mammalian cells is affected by depletion of TLS DNA polymerases by conducting replication experiments with the use of isogenic HEK293T cells depleted of individual TLS polymerases. Our results showed that in general the depletion of Pol ι or Pol κ did not appreciably impact the bypass efficiencies of the O2-alkyldT lesions except O2-iPrdT and O2-sBudT, for which loss of Pol ι led to significant decreases in bypass efficiencies (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, individual depletion of Pol η or Pol ζ resulted in significant decreases (by ∼16–30%) in bypass efficiencies for all the O2-alkyldT lesions carrying a straight-chain alkyl group (Fig. 4a), supporting that Pol η and Pol ζ play crucial roles in bypassing these O2-alkyldT lesions. In contrast, individual depletion of Pol η or Pol ζ did not appreciably perturb the replicative bypass for the three O2-alkyldT lesions possessing a branched-chain alkyl functionality (Fig. 4a). To determine the mutagenic properties of the O2-alkyldT lesions, we identified the mutant products by employing LC-MS/MS and PAGE analyses of restriction fragments of PCR products from progeny genomes. In the LC-MS/MS method, we monitored the fragmentations of the [M–3H]3− ions of d(AATTACAGCMCGC), with “M” designating the nucleotides inserted opposite the initial damage site. Our LC-MS/MS data revealed that all seven O2-alkyldT lesions exhibit similar miscoding properties, where T→A and T→G transversions, but not T→C transition, were observed (representative LC-MS and MS/MS data are shown in Figs. S3–S5). With the use of 30% native PAGE, we were able to resolve 5′-32P–labeled d(p*CATGGCGTGCTGT) (nonmutagenic product, 13-mer T) from the corresponding products carrying a T→A or T→G mutation, i.e. d(p*CATGGCGAGCTGT) (13-mer A) and d(p*CATGGCGGGCTGT) (13-mer G) (Fig. 3, b and c and Figs. S1 and S2). However, the nonmutagenic product comigrated with the corresponding product with a T→C mutation at the lesion site, i.e. d(p*CATGGCGCGCTGT) (13-mer C) (Fig. 3, b and c and Figs. S1 and S2). Because of the lack of T→C mutation arising from replication past the O2-alkyldT lesions, we determined the frequencies of the lesion-induced mutations by using native PAGE analysis. Similar to what was observed previously in E. coli cells (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the major type of mutation induced by the O2-alkyldT lesions in HEK293T cells was T→A transversion, which was detected at frequencies of 1–13% and was accompanied with lower frequencies (0.5–6%) of T→G substitution (Fig. 4, b and c). In addition, the frequencies for T→A and T→G mutations for the O2-alkyldT lesions with straight-chain alkyl group rise with the increasing length of the alkyl group (Fig. 4, b and c). These elevations in mutation frequencies were associated with concomitant decreases in bypass efficiencies for the lesions (see above). Thus, the increases in chain length of the alkyl group adducted to the O2-position of thymine led to greater diminutions in both the efficiency and fidelity of replication across the O2-alkyldT lesions in human cells. We next examined the mutagenic properties of the O2-alkyldT lesions in HEK293T cells that are deficient in Pol η, Pol ι, Pol κ, or Pol ζ and compared the results with what we obtained for the parental HEK293T cells. Our results revealed that Pol η and Pol ζ played an important role in the misincorporation of dTMP opposite the O2-alkyldT lesions regardless of the alkyl chain being straight or branched, as reflected by the finding that the depletion of either polymerase resulted in a significant drop in T→A mutation (Fig. 4b). The only exception was that the loss of Pol ζ did not alter the frequency of T→A mutation for O2-sBudT (Fig. 4b). Likewise, genetic ablation of Pol η led to substantial diminutions in T→G mutation for all O2-alkyldT lesions except O2-iBudT and O2-sBudT (Fig. 4c), indicating a role of Pol η in the misincorporation of dCMP opposite these O2-alkyldT lesions. Moreover, for those lesions bearing straight-chain alkyl groups, depletion of Pol κ led to marked reductions in T→G mutation (Fig. 4c), whereas Pol ζ functions in dCMP misincorporation opposite those O2-alkyldT lesions with branched-chain alkyl groups (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, Pol ι played an important role in dTMP misinsertion opposite the sites of those O2-alkyldT lesions carrying a large alkyl group (i.e. O2-nBudT, O2-iBudT, and O2-sBudT) (Fig. 4b). Cumulatively, these results demonstrated that the effects of depletion of TLS DNA polymerases on the mutagenic properties of the O2-alkyldT lesions are highly dependent on the chemical structures (i.e. chain length and chain topology) of the alkyl group being conjugated with the O2-position of thymidine, and are further modulated by TLS DNA polymerases. In this study, we assessed comprehensively the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of O2-alkyldT lesions in HEK293T cells and the isogenic cells where the individual TLS polymerases were depleted by the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method. Our results revealed that, similar to what we observed in E. coli cells (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the O2-alkyldT lesions inhibit strongly DNA replication in mammalian cells, with the blockage effect increasing with the size and branching of the alkyl groups (Fig. 4a). This result underscores the increased difficulty experienced by the DNA polymerases in accommodating those O2-alkyldT lesions with longer and bulkier alkyl chain into their active sites, which confers reduced efficiencies in nucleotide incorporation at or near the lesion site. In this context, it is worth noting that the differential rate of repair of the O2-alkyldT lesions may also contribute in part to the differences in the observed replication bypass efficiencies. In addition, we found that the bypass efficiencies for all the O2-alkyldT lesions carrying a straight chain alkyl group were significantly reduced in cells depleted of Pol η or Pol ζ (Fig. 4a), suggesting that these two TLS polymerases play important roles in bypassing these lesions in vivo. This is reminiscent of our previous finding that Pol V, the E. coli ortholog of human Pol η, constitutes the major TLS polymerase for bypassing these lesions (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and is consistent with results obtained from in vitro replication experiments showing that human Pol η was capable of bypassing readily these lesions in template DNA (26Williams N.L. Wang P. Wang Y. Replicative bypass of O2-alkylthymidine lesions in vitro.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2016; 29 (27611246): 1755-176110.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00252Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, Pol ζ is known to participate in extension step of the TLS after nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion site (27Shachar S. Ziv O. Avkin S. Adar S. Wittschieben J. Reißner T. Chaney S. Friedberg E.C. Wang Z. Carell T. Geacintov N. Livneh Z. Two-polymerase mechanisms dictate error-free and error-prone translesion DNA synthesis in mammals.EMBO J. 2009; 28 (19153606): 383-39310.1038/emboj.2008.281Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Together, our results suggest that Pol η and Pol ζ may cooperate in bypassing the O2-alkyldT lesions with a straight-chain alkyl group, with Pol η and Pol ζ being involved in the insertion and extension steps of the lesion bypass, respectively. It will be important to assess, in the future, how replication across these lesions in human cells are affected by simultaneous depletion of both Pol η and Pol ζ, and biochemically how Pol η and Pol ζ may function together in bypassing the O2-alkyldT lesions in vitro. Our results demonstrated that the O2-alkyldT lesions primarily directed the misincorporations of pyrimidine nucleotides (i.e. dTMP and dCMP), and replicative bypass of these lesions yields T→A and T→G mutations. This finding is in line with the notion that the incorporation of an alkyl group to the O2-position of thymine may render the nucleobase unfavorable in pairing with any of the four canonical nucleobases (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This observation is also in agreement with the finding that T→A and T→G transversions constitute the two main types of mutations induced by these lesions in E. coli (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Different from what we found in E. coli cells, we did not observe T→C mutation for any of the O2-alkyldT lesions in WT HEK293T cells or the isogenic cells depleted of any of the TLS polymerases (Fig. S3–S5), which could be attributed to the differential recognition of these lesions by replication machineries of human and E. coli cells. By conducting replication experiments in cells depleted of TLS polymerases, we showed that misincorporation of dTMP opposite O2-alkyldT and perhaps the subsequent extension beyond the lesion site require both Pol η and Pol ζ (Fig. 4, b and c), suggesting that Pol η and Pol ζ are the major polymerases responsible for dTMP misincorporation and subsequent extension beyond the O2-alkyldT lesions in human cells. In keeping with the previous finding that both Pol IV and Pol V were required for inducing T→G mutation (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), their orthologs in human cells, i.e. Pol κ and Pol η, were the major polymerases contributing to the induction of T→G mutation for the straight-chain O2-alkyldT lesions (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, Pol ζ was the only TLS polymerase found to be required for the T→G mutation induced by the three branched-chain O2-alkyldT lesions (Fig. 4c), although it remains unclear which polymerase might be involved in the dCMP misincorporation opposite these lesions. Taken together, our systematic shuttle vector-based study on a group of structurally defined O2-alkyldT lesions provided important new insights into the impact of this under-investigated group of DNA lesions on the efficiency and accuracy of DNA replication in mammalian cells. The findings made in the present study unveiled that, in mammalian cells, the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of these DNA lesions depend on the size and branching of the alkyl group and are further modulated by TLS DNA polymerases. Moreover, the significant inhibitory effects of the O2-alkyldT lesions on DNA replication, their strong mutagenic potentials, and their resistance to repair suggest that the O2-alkyldT lesions constitute a family of biologically important DNA lesions. All chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were from Sigma-Aldrich or EMD Millipore. HFIP was obtained from TCI America (Portland, OR). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer, and all other enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB) (Ipswich, MA). All unmodified oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The 12-mer ODNs harboring a site-specifically incorporated O2-alkyldT were synthesized previously (20Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The identities and purities of all the lesion-harboring ODNs were confirmed by LC-MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) analyses prior to their insertion into double-stranded plasmids. HEK293T cells with POLH, POLI, POLK and POLZ genes, which encode DNA polymerases η, ι, κ, and ζ, respectively, being individually depleted by the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing method were described previously (23Wu J. Li L. Wang P.C. You C.J. Williams N.L. Wang Y.S.

The lesion-containing and lesion-free genomes were prepared according to the previously reported procedures (22You C. Swanson A.L. Dai X. Yuan B. Wang J. Wang Y.

The parent vector was subsequently digested with Nt.BstNBI, followed with removing the 25-mer ODN by annealing with a 25-mer complementary ODN in large excess to generate a gapped vector. The gapped vector was subsequently purified from the mixture by centrifugation using 100 kDa-cutoff ultracentrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore). The gap in the vector was filled with a 5′-phosphorylated 13-mer lesion-free ODN (5′-AATTGAGTCGATG-3′) and a 5′-phosphorylated 12-mer lesion-containing or lesion-free ODN (5′-ATGGCGXGCTAT-3′, where X = O2-alkyldT or dT) by using T4 DNA ligase in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2a). The successfully ligated, supercoiled plasmid was isolated from the ligation mixture by using agarose gel electrophoresis. The amounts of constructed lesion-containing vectors were normalized against that of the lesion-free competitor vector following published procedures (22You C. Swanson A.L. Dai X. Yuan B. Wang J.

The lesion-bearing and the corresponding nonlesion control plasmids were individually premixed with the competitor genome at a molar ratio of 19:1 for all replication experiments. The HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The HEK293T cells and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineered cells (1 × 105) were seeded in a 24-well plate and cultured for 24 h before they were transfected with the aforementioned plasmid mixtures by using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer’s recommended procedures, where a total of 300 ng of lesion and competitor or control and competitor genome mixture along with 500 ng of carrier plasmid were employed for each transfection. The cells were harvested at 24 h following the transfection, and the progeny genomes were isolated using Qiagen Spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with minor modifications (28Ziegler K. Bui T.

The residual unreplicated plasmids were further digested with DpnI, followed by removing the resulting linear DNA with exonuclease III, as described elsewhere (29Burns J.A. Dreij K. Cartularo L.

Along this line, there were 25 DpnI recognition sites in the parental plasmid; therefore, digestion at any one of these sites would result in the degradation of the entire plasmid by exonuclease III and prevent the following PCR amplification of the parental vector. The progeny genomes resulting from cellular replication were amplified by PCR with the use of GoTaq Hot Start DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The two primers were 5′-GCTAGCGGATGCATCGACTCAATTACAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGATTATGATCTAGAGTTGCGGCCGC-3′, and the PCR amplifications started at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified using Cycle Pure Kit (Omega, Norcross, GA) and stored at −20 °C until use. For PAGE analysis, a portion of the PCR products were treated with 5 units NcoI and 1 unit shrimp alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C in 10 μl of NEB buffer 3 for 1 h, and the shrimp alkaline phosphatase was subsequently deactivated by heating at 80 °C for 20 min. The above mixture was then treated with 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in 15-μl NEB buffer 3 containing 5 mm DTT and ATP (10 pmol cold, premixed with 1.66 pmol [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was continued at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by heating at 65 °C for 20 min to deactivate the polynucleotide kinase. To the reaction mixture was subsequently added 2 units of SfaNI in 5 μl NEB buffer 3, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, followed by quenching with 20 μl of formamide gel–loading buffer containing xylene cyanol FF and bromphenol blue dyes. The mixture was loaded onto 30% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 19:1), and the gel band intensities were quantified by phosphorimager analysis. The effects of DNA lesions on replication efficiency and fidelity were characterized by bypass efficiency and mutation frequency, respectively. The bypass efficiency was calculated as (lesion signal/competitor signal)/(nonlesion control signal/competitor signal) × 100%. The mutation frequency was determined from the percentage of the amount of mutagenic product among the total amounts of products formed from replication of the lesion-containing genome (32You C.

The PCR products were digested with 30 units SfaNI restriction endonuclease and 15 units shrimp alkaline phosphatase in 150 μl NEB buffer 3 at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by deactivation of the phosphatase at 80 °C for 20 min.

https://openalex.org/W2799409858,"Background Weekends off antiretroviral therapy (ART) may help engage HIV-1-infected young people facing lifelong treatment. BREATHER showed short cycle therapy (SCT; 5 days on, 2 days off ART) was non-inferior to continuous therapy (CT) over 48 weeks. Planned follow-up was extended to 144 weeks, maintaining original randomisation. Methods BREATHER was an open-label, non-inferiority trial. Participants aged 8-24yrs with virological suppression on efavirenz-based first-line ART were randomised 1:1, stratified by age and African/non-African sites, to remain on CT or change to SCT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the proportion of participants with viral rebound (confirmed VL≥50 copies/mL) under intent-to-treat at 48 weeks (primary outcome), and in extended follow-up at 96, 144, and 192 weeks. SCT participants returned to CT following viral rebound, 3 VL blips or discontinuation of efavirenz. Findings Of 199 participants (99 SCT, 100 CT), 97 per arm consented to extended follow-up. Median follow-up was 185.3 weeks (IQR 160.9–216.1). 69 (70%) SCT participants remained on SCT at last follow-up. 105 (53%) were male, baseline median age 14 years (IQR 12–18), median CD4 count 735 cells/μL (IQR 576–968). 16 SCT and 16 CT participants had confirmed VL≥50 copies/mL by the end of extended follow-up (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50–2.00). Estimated difference in percentage with viral rebound (SCT minus CT) by week 144 was 1.9% (90% CI -6.6–10.4; p = 0.72) and was similar in a per-protocol analysis. There were no significant differences between arms in proportions of participants with grade 3/4 adverse events (18 SCT vs 16 CT participants; p = 0.71) or ART-related adverse events (10 vs 12; p = 0.82). 20 versus 8 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 16 SCT versus 4 CT participants, respectively (p = 0.005 comparing proportions between groups; incidence rate ratio 2.49, 95%CI 0.71–8.66, p = 0.15). 75% of SAEs (15 SCT, 6 CT) were hospitalisations for a wide range of conditions. 3 SCT and 6 CT participants switched to second-line ART following viral failure (p = 0.50). Conclusions Sustainable non-inferiority of virological suppression in young people was shown for SCT versus CT over median 3.6 years. Standard-dose efavirenz-based SCT is a viable option for virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected young people on first-line ART with 3-monthly VL monitoring.

https://openalex.org/W2801342489,"Gastric epithelial cells infected with Helicobacter pylori acquire highly invasive and metastatic characteristics. The seven in absentia homolog (Siah)2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is one of the major proteins that induces invasiveness of infected gastric epithelial cells. We find that p300-driven acetylation of Siah2 at lysine 139 residue stabilizes the molecule in infected cells, thereby substantially increasing its efficiency to degrade prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)3 in the gastric epithelium. This enhances the accumulation of an oncogenic transcription factor hypoxia- inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) in H. pylori-infected gastric cancer cells in normoxic condition and promotes invasiveness of infected cells. Increased acetylation of Siah2, Hif1α accumulation, and the absence of PHD3 in the infected human gastric metastatic cancer biopsy samples and in invasive murine gastric cancer tissues further confirm that the acetylated Siah2 (ac-Siah2)-Hif1α axis is crucial in promoting gastric cancer invasiveness. This study establishes the importance of a previously unrecognized function of ac-Siah2 in regulating invasiveness of H. pylori- infected gastric epithelial cells.—Kokate, S.

Although objective measures of poor vision have been reported to be associated with falls, the association of self-reported visual function and vision-specific quality of life (QOL) with falls has been inconsistent across several studies. We investigated the association of self-reported visual function and vision specific QOL with falls in community-dwelling older adults.We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the baseline data from participants of the Locomotive Syndrome and Health Outcome in Aizu Cohort Study (LOHAS), which is an ongoing population-based cohort study to evaluate the association of physical dysfunction with the clinical outcomes in community-dwelling people. In the present study, the participants aged over 65 years in 2010 were eligible. The exposure variable was the composite score of the VFQ-J11, which was newly developed using item response theory to evaluate vision specific QOL, and the self-reported outcomes were any fall and frequent falls (≥2) over a 1-month period. We estimated odds ratios using separate logistic regression models adjusted for relevant confounding factors.Among 1624 participants, the median (interquartile range) composite score of VFQ-J11 was 86.8 (76.0-95.9). Any fall and frequent falls were reported by 13.9% and 5.4% of participants, respectively. The composite score of the VFQ-J11 was significantly associated with both frequent falls (adjusted ORs per 10 points, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93) and any fall (adjusted ORs per 10 points, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94).We found that the composite score of the VFQ-J11 was associated with falls in community-dwelling older adults. Detecting individuals with visual impairments associated with falls using the VFQ-J11 and improvement in the score by interventions could prevent falls. We may consider adding self-reported visual function and vision-specific QOL to conventional risk factors for fall among older adults."

CTZ shown a humidity content of 0.150% and a spontaneous hygroscopicity of 0.200% (both determined by SeDeM diagram), demonstrating an adequate stability behavior in solid form. A design of experiments (DoE) performed with both mannitol and PVP K30, followed by a simple factorial design (32) has determined the optimum combination of excipients and CTZ, and showed that a higher proportion of PVP K30 was able to prevent metastable forms generated by mannitol."
https://openalex.org/W2800889318,"This study examined how people evaluate ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors, especially their predictions of the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors (Study 1). Further, it examined the individual effects of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors of an actor on the evaluation of his/her trait by considering the cases where the actor engages in and does not engage in the other behavior (Study 2). Study 1 revealed that the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors was perceived asymmetrically. Specifically, while the likelihood of ordinary prosocial actors to engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors was perceived as high, the same perception was not observed for extraordinary prosocial behaviors. On the other hand, extraordinary prosocial actors were perceived as highly likely to engage in both ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Study 2 revealed that the evaluation of actors who engaged in extraordinary prosocial behaviors but not ordinary prosocial behaviors did not exceed the evaluation of actors who engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors but not extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Additionally, the effect of extraordinary prosocial behaviors was more when the actor also engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors. These results suggest that extraordinary prosocial actors are evaluated highly when they also engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2799378058,"The opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been recognized as an important pathogen of clinical relevance and is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. The presence of a glycolytic enzyme in Pseudomonas, which is known to be inhibited by trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) in other organisms, suggests that these bacteria may be vulnerable to the detrimental effects of intracellular T6P accumulation. In the present study, we explored the structural and functional properties of trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) in P. aeruginosa in support of future target-based drug discovery. A survey of genomes revealed the existence of 2 TPP genes with either chromosomal or extrachromosomal location. Both TPPs were produced as recombinant proteins, and characterization of their enzymatic properties confirmed specific, magnesium-dependent catalytic hydrolysis of T6P. The 3-dimensional crystal structure of the chromosomal TPP revealed a protein dimer arising through β-sheet expansion of the individual monomers, which possess the overall fold of halo-acid dehydrogenases.-Cross, M., Biberacher, S., Park, S.-Y., Rajan, S., Korhonen, P., Gasser, R.

https://openalex.org/W2799742162,"Balancing the number of nursing staff in relation to the number of patients is important for hospitals to remain efficient and optimizing the use of resources. One way to do this is to work with a workload management method. Many workload management methods use a time study to determine how nurses spend their time and to relate this to patient characteristics in order to predict nurse workload.In our study, we aim to determine how nurses spend their working day and we will attempt to explain differences between specialized surgical wards.The research took place in an academic hospital in the Netherlands. Six surgical wards were included, capacity 15 to 30 beds.We have used a work sampling methodology where trained observers registered activities of nurses and patient details every ten minutes during the day shift for a time period of three weeks.The work sampling showed that nurses spend between 40.1% and 55.8% of their time on direct patient care. In addition to this, nurses spend between 11.0% and 14.1% on collective patient care. In total, between 52.1% and 68% of time spent on tasks is directly patient related. We found significant differences between wards for 10 of the 21 activity groups. We also found that nurses spend on average 31% with the patient (bedside), which is lower than in another study (37%). However, we noticed a difference between departments. For regular surgical departments in our study this was on average 34% and for two departments that have additional responsibilities in training and education of nursing students, this was on average 25%.We found a relatively low percentage of time spent on direct plus indirect care, and a lower percentage of time spent with the patient. We suspect that this is due to the academic setting of the study; in our hospital, there are more tasks related to education than in hospitals in other study settings. We also found differences between the wards in our study, which are mostly explained by differences in the patient mix, nurse staffing (proportion of nursing students), type of surgery and region of the body where the surgery was performed. However, we could not explain all differences. We made a first attempt in identifying and explaining differences in nurses' activities between wards, however this domain needs more research in order to better explain the differences."
https://openalex.org/W2799515820,"Objective Bioactive oxidised lipids (oxylipins) are important signalling mediators, capable of modulating the inflammatory state of the joint and anticipated to be of importance in joint homeostasis and status of osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to quantify oxylipin levels in plasma and synovial fluid from rats with experimentally induced osteoarthritis to investigate the potential role of oxylipins as a marker in the disease process of early osteoarthritis. Design Forty rats were randomly allocated to a standard or high-fat diet group. After 12 weeks, local cartilage damage was induced in one knee joint in 14 rats of each diet group. The remaining 6 rats per group served as controls. At week 24, samples were collected. Oxylipin levels were quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Results Overall, 31 lipid-derived inflammatory mediators were detected in fasted plasma and synovial fluid. Principal component analysis identified four distinct clusters associated with histopathological changes. Diet induced differences were evident for 13 individual plasma oxylipins, as well as 5,6-EET in synovial fluid. Surgical-model induced differences were evident for three oxylipins in synovial fluid (15-HETE, 8,9-DHET and 17R-ResolvinD1) with a different response in lipid concentrations for synovial fluid and plasma. Conclusions We demonstrate the quantification of oxidised lipids in rat plasma and synovial fluid in a model of early experimental osteoarthritis. Oxylipins in the synovial fluid that were altered as consequence of the surgically induced osteoarthritis were not represented in the plasma. Our findings suggest differential roles of the oxylipins in the local versus peripheral compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2801744355,"There are only few reports regarding the role of lifetime drug or substance use in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of drug or substance exposure on the onset of MS diagnosis. We conducted a population-based incident case control study in Tehran. Cases (n = 547) were 15–50 years old persons with MS identified from the Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Society (IMSS) register during August 7, 2013, and November 17, 2015. Population-based controls (n = 1057) were 15–50 years old and were recruited by random digit telephone dialing. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighing (IPTW) using two sets of propensity scores (PSs) was used to estimate marginal incidence odds ratios (ORs) for MS contrasting pre-specified substance use. The estimated marginal OR was 6.03 (95% confidence interval: 3.54;10.3, using trimmed weights at the 95th percentile of the stabilized weight distribution) in both IPTW analyses comparing lifetime substance use (opioids, cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens and stimulants) for at least one time monthly during a six-months or longer period vs. no such history of drug use. Subject to limitation of causal claims based on case-control studies, this study suggests that monthly drug or substance use for a period of at least six consecutive months, may increase the risk of MS by factor 3.5 or higher."
https://openalex.org/W2800015233,"Age-related cataract (ARC) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. DNA damage and malfunction of DNA repair are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of ARC. Aside from increasing age, the risk factors for ARC appear to be rather complex, and one or more gene variations could play critical roles in the diverse processes of ARC progression. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of different genetic variants on ARC risk.A cohort of 789 ARC patients and 531 normal controls from the Jiangsu Eye Study was included in this study. Genotyping of 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 DNA damage/repair genes was performed using TaqMan SNP assays. SNP-SNP interactions were analyzed via multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), classification and regression tree (CART) and genetic risk score (GRS) analyses.Based on single-locus analyses of the 18 SNPs examined, WRN-rs11574311 (T>C) was associated with ARC risk. However, in MDR, the gene-gene interaction among the five SNPs (WRN-rs4733220 (G>A), WRN-rs1801195 (T>G), OGG1-rs2072668 (G>C) and OGG1-rs2304277 (A>G)) on ARC risk was significant (OR = 5.03, 95% CI: 3.54~7.13). CART analyses also revealed that the combination of five SNPs above was the best polymorphic signature for discriminating between the cases and the controls. The overall odds ratio for CART ranged from 4.56 to 7.90 showing an incremental risk for ARC. This result indicated that these critical SNPs participate in complex interactions. The GRS results showed an increased risk for ARC among individuals with the SNPs in this polymorphic signature.The use of multifactorial analysis (or an integrated approach) rather than a single methodology could be an improved strategy for identifying complex gene interactions. The multifactorial approach used in this study has the potential to identify complex biological relationships among ARC-related genes and processes. This approach will lead to the discovery of novel biological information, ultimately improving ARC risk management."
https://openalex.org/W2801175331,"Nitrogen assimilation and metabolism are essential processes for all living organisms, yet there is still much to be learnt on how they are regulated. The use of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model system has been instrumental not only in identifying conserved regulation mechanisms that control the nitrogen assimilation pathway, but also in understanding how the intracellular nitrogen status regulates metabolic processes of industrial interest such as the synthesis of biolipids. While the genetic regulators that control the nitrogen pathway are successfully being unravelled, other layers of regulation have received less attention. Amino acids, for example, regulate nitrogen assimilation in certain organisms, but their role in Chlamydomonas has not thoroughly been explored. Previous results had suggested that arginine might repress key genes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway by acting within the ammonium negative signalling cascade, upstream of the nitric oxide (NO) inducible guanylate cyclase CYG56. We tested this hypothesis with a combination of genetic and chemical approaches. Antagonising the effects of arginine with an arginine biosynthesis mutant or with two chemical analogues released gene expression from ammonium mediated repression. The cyg56 and related non1 mutants, which are partially insensitive to ammonium repression, were also partially insensitive to repression by arginine. Finally, we show that the addition of arginine to the medium leads to an increase in intracellular NO. Our data reveal that arginine acts as a negative signal for the assimilation of nitrogen within the ammonium-CYG56 negative signalling cascade, and provide a connection between amino acid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation in microalgae."
https://openalex.org/W2802792698,"HIV/AIDS (Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immune deficiency syndrome) not only has a strong impact on the health of the worldwide population but also affects the labour status of HIV-positive people. The primary aim of this paper is to compare the labour participation of people living with HIV (PlwHIV) with the labour participation of the general population along the last business cycle in Spain.The data used are from the Hospital Survey on HIV-AIDS, with a total sample size of 4,651 PlwHIV and the Labour Force Survey from 2001 to 2010, with a total sample size of 660,674 individuals as general population. Propensity Score Matching method was used to analyse the differences between the labour participation of PlwHIV and the general population. Additionally, several specific models categorised into different subgroups (gender, education, source of infection and level of defences) were also performed.We identified a convergence in labour participation across the period in the two populations considered: PlwHIV was 23% less likely to have a job than the general population during 2001-2002 and 14% less likely during 2009-2010. This convergence is mainly explained by two facts: first, the positive evolution of people infected by sex; second, the change in the PlwHIV population composition with a decreasing weight of people infected by drug use throughout the decade. Thereby, at the end of period, there was no statistical difference in the employment rate between PlwHIV infected through sex and the general population but there was strongly difference in PlwHIV infected through drugs.Inmunological status, source of infection and level of education play a relevant role among the PlwHIV population when comparing their labour participation with the general population. In spite of this positive result, the likelihood of being employed in HIV-positive people continues to be different from that of non-carriers. Our study shows that institutional features of labour markets are relevant and should be considered in comparison between countries."
https://openalex.org/W2799377662,"A molecular epidemiology study of HIV-1 infection was conducted in one hundred diagnosed and untreated HIV-1-infected patients in Cyprus between 2010 and 2012, representing 65.4% of all the reported HIV-1 infections in Cyprus in this three-year period, using a previously defined enrolment strategy. Eighty-two patients were newly diagnosed (genotypic drug resistance testing within six months from diagnosis), and eighteen patients were HIV-1 diagnosed for a longer period or the diagnosis date was unknown. Phylogenetic trees of the pol sequences obtained in this study with reference sequences indicated that subtypes B and A1 were the most common subtypes present and accounted for 41.0 and 19.0% respectively, followed by subtype C (7.0%), F1 (8.0%), CRF02_AG (4.0%), A2 (2.0%), other circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) (7.0%) and unknown recombinant forms (URFs) (12%). Most of the newly-diagnosed study subjects were Cypriots (63%), males (78%) with median age 39 (Interquartile Range, IQR 33-48) reporting having sex with other men (MSM) (51%). A high rate of clustered transmission of subtype B drug-sensitive strains to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors was observed among MSM, twenty-eight out of forty-one MSM study subjects (68.0%) infected were implicated in five transmission clusters, two of which are sub-subtype A1 and three of which are subtype B strains. The two largest MSM subtype B clusters included nine and eight Cypriot men, respectively, living in all major cities in Cyprus. There were only three newly diagnosed patients with transmitted drug resistant HIV-1 strains, one study subject from the United Kingdom infected with subtype B strain and one from Romania with sub-subtype A2 strain, both with PI drug resistance mutation M46L and one from Greece with sub-subtype A1 with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) drug resistance mutation K103N."
https://openalex.org/W2800552257,"We previously identified ovostatin 2 (OVOS2) as a new candidate gene for cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) in a Chinese population. In this study, we aimed to investigate the exact role of OVOS2 in cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis of melanoma A375 cells.The downregulation of OVOS2 expression was performed using lentiviral vectors with specific shRNA. The effects of OVOS2 expression on cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell migration, cell invasion, and potential of tumorigenesis were further investigated.The downregulation of OVOS2 significantly suppressed the proliferation of A375 cells and led to a G2/M phase block. The transwell cell migration assay showed that the reduced expression of OVOS2 also significantly inhibited the transmigration of A375 cells. The western blot results showed downregulated expression of p-FAK, p-AKT, and p-ERK. This was accompanied by the upregulated epithelial phenotypes E-cadherin and β-catenin, and downregulated expression of mesenchymal phenotype N-cadherin after OVOS2 knockdown. The transplantation tumor experiment in BALB/C nude mouse showed that after an observation period of 32 days, the growth speed and weight of the transplanted tumors were significantly suppressed in the BALB/c nude mice subcutaneously injected with OVOS2 knocked-down A375 cells.The inhibition of OVOS2 had significant suppressive effects on the proliferation, motility, and migration capabilities of A375 cells, suggesting a crucial promotive role of OVOS2 in the pathogenesis and progression of CMM. The involved mechanisms are at least partly associated with the overactivation of FAK/MAPK/ERK and FAK/PI3K/AKT signals."
https://openalex.org/W2801501308,"Background Patients with a permanent impairment may be unable to reach full health. Consequently health services which cure illnesses which are unrelated to the impairment may increase health less than services for patients with no impairment. While it has been argued that this should not lead to discrimination against impaired patients there is little evidence to determine whether this equity-efficiency trade-off is consistent with social values. Objectives To measure the effect of permanent impairment upon the social valuation of services for unrelated illnesses. Methods Social valuations of services for illnesses associated with mobility, depression or pain were assessed and compared for patients with and without a permanent impairment using the Relative Social Willingness to Pay (RS-WTP) instrument. The maximum valuation of services for impaired patients was also compared with the maximum utility which could be gained when utility was measured using three multi attribute utility instruments. Results Curing the illness of impaired patients was valued 8–11 percent less than the cure of patients with no impairment. Discrimination decreased as the severity of the illness increased. Valuation of health states using the utility instruments implied significantly greater discrimination than the social valuations using the RS-WTP instrument. Conclusions Health services are valued less highly when a patient’s health potential is impaired. However discrimination is significantly less than would occur if the value of the services were limited to the value of the health state causing the impairment. The argument for disregarding a patient’s limited health potential when resources are allocated therefore receives some support from social valuations but the case for completely equal treatment depends upon additional ethical arguments."

https://openalex.org/W2802858311,"MRL/MpJ mice have abundant ovarian mast cells (MCs) as compared with other strains at postnatal day 0 (P0); however, they sharply decrease after birth. These ovarian MCs, particularly beneath the ovarian surface epithelium (SE), which express mucosal MC (MMC) marker, might participate in early follicular development. This study investigated the changes in spatiotemporal distribution of MCs in the perinatal MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. At P0 to P7, the MCs were densely localized to the ovary, especially their caudomedial region around the ovary-fimbria connection. The neonatal ovarian MCs showed intermediate characteristics of MMC and connective tissue MC (CTMC), and the latter phenotype became evident with aging. However, the expression ratio of the MMC to CTMC marker increased from P0 to P4 in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovary. Similarly, the ratio of MCs facing SE to total MC number increased with aging, although the number of ovarian MCs decreased, indicating the relative increase in MMC phenotypes in the early neonatal ovary. Neither proliferating nor apoptotic MCs were found in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. The parenchymal cells surrounding MCs at ovary-fimbria connection showed similar molecular expression patterns (E-cadherin+/Foxl2-/Gata4+) as that of the ovarian surface epithelial cells. At P2, around the ovary-fimbria connection, c-kit- immature oocytes formed clusters called nests, and some MCs localized adjacent to c-kit- oocytes within the nests. These results indicated that in postnatal MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian MCs changed their distribution by migrating toward the parenchymal cells composing ovary-fimbria connection, which possessed similar characteristics to the ovarian surface epithelium. Thus, we elucidated the spatiotemporal alterations of the ovarian MCs in MRL/MpJ mice, and suggested their importance during the early follicular development by migrating toward the ovary-fimbria connection. MRL/MpJ mice would be useful to elucidate the relationship between neonatal immunity and reproductive systems."
