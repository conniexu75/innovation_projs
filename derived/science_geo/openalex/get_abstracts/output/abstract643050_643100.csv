https://openalex.org/W2983765585,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with approximately 1% lifetime risk globally. Large-scale schizophrenia genetic studies have reported primarily on European ancestry samples, potentially missing important biological insights. Here, we report the largest study to date of East Asian participants (22,778 schizophrenia cases and 35,362 controls), identifying 21 genome-wide-significant associations in 19 genetic loci. Common genetic variants that confer risk for schizophrenia have highly similar effects between East Asian and European ancestries (genetic correlation = 0.98 ± 0.03), indicating that the genetic basis of schizophrenia and its biology are broadly shared across populations. A fixed-effect meta-analysis including individuals from East Asian and European ancestries identified 208 significant associations in 176 genetic loci (53 novel). Trans-ancestry fine-mapping reduced the sets of candidate causal variants in 44 loci. Polygenic risk scores had reduced performance when transferred across ancestries, highlighting the importance of including sufficient samples of major ancestral groups to ensure their generalizability across populations."

https://openalex.org/W2983330893,"Some cancer therapies damage DNA and cause mutations in both cancerous and healthy cells. Therapy-induced mutations may underlie some of the long-term and late side effects of treatments, such as mental disabilities, organ toxicity and secondary neoplasms. Nevertheless, the burden of mutation contributed by different chemotherapies has not been explored. Here we identify the mutational signatures or footprints of six widely used anticancer therapies across more than 3,500 metastatic tumors originating from different organs. These include previously known and new mutational signatures generated by platinum-based drugs as well as a previously unknown signature of nucleoside metabolic inhibitors. Exploiting these mutational footprints, we estimate the contribution of different treatments to the mutation burden of tumors and their risk of contributing coding and potential driver mutations in the genome. The mutational footprints identified here allow for precise assessment of the mutational risk of different cancer therapies to understand their long-term side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2987292422,"Expansions of short tandem repeats are genetic variants that have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and other disorders, but their assessment remains challenging with current polymerase-based methods1-4. Here we introduce a CRISPR-Cas-based enrichment strategy for nanopore sequencing combined with an algorithm for raw signal analysis. Our method, termed STRique for short tandem repeat identification, quantification and evaluation, integrates conventional sequence mapping of nanopore reads with raw signal alignment for the localization of repeat boundaries and a hidden Markov model-based repeat counting mechanism. We demonstrate the precise quantification of repeat numbers in conjunction with the determination of CpG methylation states in the repeat expansion and in adjacent regions at the single-molecule level without amplification. Our method enables the study of previously inaccessible genomic regions and their epigenetic marks."

https://openalex.org/W2986334759,"S-Palmitoylation is a reversible lipid post-translational modification that has been observed on mitochondrial proteins, but both the regulation and functional consequences of mitochondrial S-palmitoylation are poorly understood. Here, we show that perturbing the 'erasers' of S-palmitoylation, acyl protein thioesterases (APTs), with either pan-active inhibitors or a mitochondrial-targeted APT inhibitor, diminishes the antioxidant buffering capacity of mitochondria. Surprisingly, this effect was not mediated by the only known mitochondrial APT, but rather by a resident mitochondrial protein with no known endogenous function, ABHD10. We show that ABHD10 is a member of the APT family of regulatory proteins and identify peroxiredoxin-5 (PRDX5), a key antioxidant protein, as a target of ABHD10 S-depalmitoylase activity. We then find that ABHD10 regulates the S-palmitoylation status of the nucleophilic active site residue of PRDX5, providing a direct mechanistic connection between ABHD10-mediated S-depalmitoylation of PRDX5 and its antioxidant capacity."

https://openalex.org/W2986694036,"Microbiota generates millimolar concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can modulate host metabolism, immunity and susceptibility to infection. Butyrate in particular can function as a carbon source and anti-inflammatory metabolite, but the mechanism by which it inhibits pathogen virulence has been elusive. Using chemical proteomics, we found that several virulence factors encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1) are acylated by SCFAs. Notably, a transcriptional regulator of SPI-1, HilA, was acylated on several key lysine residues. Subsequent incorporation of stable butyryl-lysine analogs using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and unnatural amino acid mutagenesis revealed that site-specific modification of HilA impacts its genomic occupancy, expression of SPI-1 genes and attenuates Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium invasion of epithelial cells, as well as dissemination in vivo. Moreover, a multiple-site HilA lysine acylation mutant strain of S. Typhimurium was resistant to butyrate inhibition ex vivo and microbiota attenuation in vivo. Our results suggest that prominent microbiota-derived metabolites may directly acylate virulence factors to inhibit microbial pathogenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2985708835,"Molecular barcoding technologies that uniquely identify single cells are hampered by limitations in barcode measurement. Readout by sequencing does not preserve the spatial organization of cells in tissues, whereas imaging methods preserve spatial structure but are less sensitive to barcode sequence. Here we introduce a system for image-based readout of short (20-base-pair) DNA barcodes. In this system, called Zombie, phage RNA polymerases transcribe engineered barcodes in fixed cells. The resulting RNA is subsequently detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Using competing match and mismatch probes, Zombie can accurately discriminate single-nucleotide differences in the barcodes. This method allows in situ readout of dense combinatorial barcode libraries and single-base mutations produced by CRISPR base editors without requiring barcode expression in live cells. Zombie functions across diverse contexts, including cell culture, chick embryos and adult mouse brain tissue. The ability to sensitively read out compact and diverse DNA barcodes by imaging will facilitate a broad range of barcoding and genomic recording strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2986269122,"Here we introduce Z-lock, an optogenetic approach for reversible, light-controlled steric inhibition of protein active sites. The light oxygen voltage (LOV) domain and Zdk, a small protein that binds LOV selectively in the dark, are appended to the protein of interest where they sterically block the active site. Irradiation causes LOV to change conformation and release Zdk, exposing the active site. Computer-assisted protein design was used to optimize linkers and Zdk-LOV affinity, for both effective binding in the dark, and effective light-induced release of the intramolecular interaction. Z-lock cofilin was shown to have actin severing ability in vitro, and in living cancer cells it produced protrusions and invadopodia. An active fragment of the tubulin acetylase αTAT was similarly modified and shown to acetylate tubulin on irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2991373555,"Background Journals are trying to make their papers more accessible by creating a variety of research summaries including graphical abstracts, video abstracts, and plain language summaries. It is unknown if individuals with science, science-related, or non-science careers prefer different summaries, which approach is most effective, or even what criteria should be used for judging which approach is most effective. A survey was created to address this gap in our knowledge. Two papers from Nature on similar research topics were chosen, and different kinds of research summaries were created for each one. Questions to measure comprehension of the research, as well as self-evaluation of enjoyment of the summary, perceived understanding after viewing the summary, and the desire for more updates of that summary type were asked to determine the relative merits of each of the summaries. Results Participants (n = 538) were randomly assigned to one of the summary types. The response of adults with science, science-related, and non-science careers were slightly different, but they show similar trends. All groups performed well on a post-summary test, but participants reported higher perceived understanding when presented with a video or plain language summary (p<0.0025). All groups enjoyed video abstracts the most followed by plain language summaries, and then graphical abstracts and published abstracts. The reported preference for different summary types was generally not correlated to the comprehension of the summaries. Here we show that original abstracts and graphical abstracts are not as successful as video abstracts and plain language summaries at producing comprehension, a feeling of understanding, and enjoyment. Our results indicate the value of relaxing the word counts in the abstract to allow for more plain language or including a plain language summary section along with the abstract."
https://openalex.org/W2982974693,"Abstract H1 histamine receptor (H1HR) belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors. Recent studies have shown that H1HR expression is increased in several types of cancer. However, its functional roles in tumor progression remain largely unknown, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that H1HR is frequently unregulated in HCC, which is significantly associated with both recurrence-free survival and overall survival in HCC patients. Functional experiments revealed that H1HR promoted both the growth and metastasis of HCC cells by inducing cell cycle progression, formation of lamellipodia, production of matrix metalloproteinase 2, and suppression of cell apoptosis. Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A was found to be involved in H1HR-mediated HCC cell growth and metastasis. In addition, we found that overexpression of H1HR was mainly due to the downregulation of miR-940 in HCC cells. Moreover, the H1HR inhibitor terfenadine significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in an HCC xenograft nude mice model. Our findings demonstrate that H1HR plays a critical role in the growth and metastasis of HCC cells, which provides experimental evidence supporting H1HR as a potential drug target for the treatment of HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2991425525,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the trueness of 5 intraoral scanners (IOSs) for digital impression of simulated implant scan bodies in a partially edentulous model. A 3D printed partially edentulous mandible model made of Co-Cr with a total of 6 bilaterally positioned cylinders in the canine, second premolar, and second molar area served as the study model. Digital scans of the model were made with a reference scanner (steroSCAN neo) and 5 IOSs (CEREC Omnicam, CS3600, i500, iTero Element, and TRIOS 3) (n = 10). For each IOS's dataset, the XYZ coordinates of the cylinders were obtained from the reference point and the deviations from the reference scanner were calculated using a 3D reverse engineering program (Rapidform). The trueness values were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney post hoc test. Direction and amount of deviation differed among cylinder position and among IOSs. Regardless of the IOS type, the cylinders positioned on the left second molar, nearest to the scanning start point, showed the smallest deviation. The deviation generally increased further away from scanning start point towards the right second molar. TRIOS 3 and i500 outperformed the other IOSs for partially edentulous digital impression. The accuracy of the CEREC Omnicam, CS3600, and iTero Element were similar on the left side, but they showed more deviations on the right side of the arch when compared to the other IOSs. The accuracy of IOS is still an area that needs to be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2984581518,"In the mammalian genome, the clustered protocadherin (cPCDH) locus provides a paradigm for stochastic gene expression with the potential to generate a unique cPCDH combination in every neuron. Here we report a chromatin-based mechanism that emerges during the transition from the naive to the primed states of cell pluripotency and reduces, by orders of magnitude, the combinatorial potential in the human cPCDH locus. This mechanism selectively increases the frequency of stochastic selection of a small subset of cPCDH genes after neuronal differentiation in monolayers, 10-month-old cortical organoids and engrafted cells in the spinal cords of rats. Signs of these frequent selections can be observed in the brain throughout fetal development and disappear after birth, except in conditions of delayed maturation such as Down's syndrome. We therefore propose that a pattern of limited cPCDH-gene expression diversity is maintained while human neurons still retain fetal-like levels of maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2991421446,"Background HIV-infected female sex workers (FSWs) have poor linkage to HIV care in sub-Sahara Africa. Methods We conducted 21 participatory group discussions (PGDs) to explore factors influencing linkage to HIV care among FSWs tested for HIV through a comprehensive community-based HIV prevention project in Tanzania. Results Influences on linkage to care were present at the system, societal and individual levels. System-level factors included unfriendly service delivery environment, including lengthy pre-enrolment sessions, concerns about confidentiality, stigmatising attitudes of health providers. Societal-level factors included myths and misconceptions about ART and stigma. On the individual level, most notable was fear of not being able to continue to have a livelihood if one’s status were to be known. Facilitators were noted, including the availability of transport to services, friendly health care providers and peer-support referral and networks. Conclusion Findings of this study underscore the importance of peer-supported linkages to HIV care and the need for respectful, high-quality care."

https://openalex.org/W2991312024,"Growth in open-source hardware designs combined with the low-cost of high performance optoelectronic and robotics components has supported a resurgence of in-house custom lab equipment development. We describe a low cost (below $700), open-source, fully customizable high-throughput imaging system for analytical microbiology applications. The system comprises a Raspberry Pi camera mounted on an aluminium extrusion frame with 3D-printed joints controlled by an Arduino microcontroller running open-source Repetier Host Firmware. The camera position is controlled by simple G-code scripts supplied from a Raspberry Pi singleboard computer and allow customized time-lapse imaging of microdevices over a large imaging area. Open-source OctoPrint software allows remote access and control. This simple yet effective design allows high-throughput microbiology testing in multiple formats including formats for bacterial motility, colony growth, microtitre plates and microfluidic devices termed ‘lab-on-a-comb’ to screen the effects of different culture media components and antibiotics on bacterial growth. The open-source robot design allows customization of the size of the imaging area; the current design has an imaging area of ~420 × 300mm, which allows 29 ‘lab-on-a-comb’ devices to be imaged which is equivalent 3480 individual 1μl samples. The system can also be modified for fluorescence detection using LED and emission filters embedded on the PiCam for more sensitive detection of bacterial growth using fluorescent dyes."
https://openalex.org/W2990349575,"The current study replicated and extended previous studies by examining the mediating and moderating role of rumination in the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and depression in a community sample using both cross-sectional (n = 494; 56.9% female) and a two-months longitudinal (n = 321; 48.4% female) designs. Participants in each study were recruited through online crowdsourcing websites and completed study questionnaires. Results from Study 1 suggested that, while rumination did not appear to moderate the relationship between IU and depression, rumination appeared to partially mediates such relationship. Results from Study 2 supported rumination as fully mediating the relationship between IU and depression over two months. The brooding and reflection rumination subtypes exerted a significant indirect, but not moderating, effect on the relationship between IU and depression. Brooding exhibited a stronger mediation effect than did reflection. Overall, current results suggest that high levels of IU fuel the development of depression symptoms over time through engagement in heightened rumination. The IU-depression association appeared fully explained through rumination as it is a passive and contextually-dependent coping response that may enhance individuals’ emotion and facilitate the development of depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2991217804,"Plant allelochemicals are a group of secondary metabolites produced by plants to defend against herbivore. The mortality of two plant allelochemicals (tannic acid and gossypol) on the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), were investigated using feeding assays and the sublethal effects were evaluated using the age-stage, two-sex life table approach. Tannic acid and gossypol have deleterious effects on A. gossypii, and as the concentrations increased, the mortality of cotton aphid increased. The life history traits of A. gossypii including the developmental duration of each nymph stage, the longevity, oviposition days, total preadult survival rate and adult pre-oviposition period were not significantly affected by sublethal concentration of tannic acid (20 mg/L) and gossypol (50 mg/L), while the population parameters (r, λ and R0) were significantly affected by these two plant allelochemicals. Furthermore, tannic acid can increase the pre-adult duration time and TPOP but reduce the fecundity of A. gossypii significantly compared to the control and gossypol treatment groups. These results are helpful for comprehensively understanding the effects of plant allelochemicals on A. gossypii."

https://openalex.org/W2988234498,"Abstract Increasing evidence has suggested that liver cancer arises partially from transformed hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs). However, the detailed mechanisms underlying HPC transformation are poorly understood. In this study, we provide evidence linking the coexistence of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) with miR-199a-3p in the malignant transformation of HPCs. The examination of liver cancer specimens demonstrated that HBx and TGF-β1 expression was positively correlated with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and cluster of differentiation 90 (CD90). Importantly, EpCAM and CD90 expression was much higher in the specimens expressing both high HBx and high TGF-β1 than in those with high HBx or high TGF-β1 and the double-low-expression group. HBx and TGF-β1 double-high expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in primary liver cancer. We also found that HBx and TGF-β1 induced the transformation of HPCs into hepatic cancer stem cells and promoted epithelial–mesenchymal transformation, which was further enhanced by concomitant HBx and TGF-β1 exposure. Moreover, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway was involved in the malignant transformation of HPCs. miR-199a-3p was identified as a significantly upregulated microRNA in HPCs upon HBx and TGF-β1 exposure, which were shown to promote miR-199a-3p expression via c-Jun-mediated activation. Finally, we found that miR-199a-3p was responsible for the malignant transformation of HPCs. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that TGF-β1 cooperates with HBx to promote the malignant transformation of HPCs through a JNK/c-Jun/miR-199a-3p-dependent pathway. This may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting the malignant transformation of HPCs in treating liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2990840410,"Drug-Resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is estimated to cause about 10% of all TB related deaths. There is dearth of data on determinants of DR-TB mortality in Nigeria. Death among DR-TB treated cohorts in Nigeria from 2010 to 2013 was 30%, 29%, 15% and 13% respectively. Our objective was to identify factors affecting survival among DR-TB patients in northern Nigeria.Demographic and clinical data of all DR-TB patients enrolled in Kano, Katsina and Bauchi states of Nigeria between 1st February 2015 and 30th November 2016 was used. Survival analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier and multiple regression with Cox proportional hazard modeling.Mean time to death during treatment is 19.2 weeks and 3.9 weeks among those awaiting treatment. Death was recorded among 38 of the 147 DR-TB patients assessed. HIV co-infection significantly increased probability of mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 2.35, 95% CI: 1.05-5.29, p = 0.038. Treatment delay showed significant negative association with survival (p = 0.000), not starting treatment significantly reduced probability of survival with an aHR of 7.98, 95% CI: 2.83-22.51, p = 0.000. Adjusted hazard ratios for patients started on treatment more than eight weeks after detection or within two to four weeks after detection, was beneficial though not statistically significant with respective p-values of 0.056 and 0.092. The model of care (facility vs. community-based) did not significantly influence survival.Both HIV co-infected DR-TB patients and DR-TB patients that fail to start treatment immediately after diagnosis are at significant risk of mortality. Our study showed no significant difference in mortality based on models of care. The study highlights the need to address programmatic and operational issues pertaining to treatment delays and strengthening DR-TB/HIV co-management as key strategies to reduce mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2991470386,"Acinetobacter bereziniae is an environmental microorganism with increasing clinical incidence, and may thus provide a model for a bacterial species bridging the gap between the environment and the clinical setting. A. bereziniae plasmids have been poorly studied, and their characterization could offer clues on the causes underlying the leap between these two different habitats. Here we characterized the whole plasmid content of A. bereziniae HPC229, a clinical strain previously reported to harbor a 44-kbp plasmid, pNDM229, conferring carbapenem and aminoglycoside resistance. We identified five extra plasmids in HPC229 ranging from 114 to 1.3 kbp, including pAbe229-114 (114 kbp) encoding a MOBP111 relaxase and carrying heavy metal resistance, a bacteriophage defense BREX system and four different toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. Two other replicons, pAbe229-15 (15.4 kbp) and pAbe229-9 (9.1 kbp), both encoding MOBQ1 relaxases and also carrying TA systems, were found. The three latter plasmids contained Acinetobacter Rep_3 superfamily replication initiator protein genes, and functional analysis of their transfer regions revealed the mobilizable nature of them. HPC229 also harbors two smaller plasmids, pAbe229-4 (4.4 kbp) and pAbe229-1 (1.3 kbp), the former bearing a ColE1-type replicon and a TA system, and the latter lacking known replication functions. Comparative sequence analyses against deposited Acinetobacter genomes indicated that the above five HPC229 plasmids were unique, although some regions were also present in other of these genomes. The transfer, replication, and adaptive modules in pAbe229-15, and the stability module in pAbe229-9, were bordered by sites potentially recognized by XerC/XerD site-specific tyrosine recombinases, thus suggesting a potential mechanism for their acquisition. The presence of Rep_3 and ColE1-based replication modules, different mob genes, distinct adaptive functions including resistance to heavy metal and other environmental stressors, as well as antimicrobial resistance genes, and a high content of XerC/XerD sites among HPC229 plasmids provide evidence of substantial links with bacterial species derived from both environmental and clinical habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2990053461,"Introduction Protecting vaccines from freeze damage is considered one of the most poorly addressed problems in vaccine management. Freezing may impair the potency especially of adsorbed vaccines. The Keep Cool study aims at ensuring optimal vaccine storage conditions in general practices. This publication analyses the baseline data using standardised temperature recordings. Methods This prospective study in German general practices analysed 7-day temperature recordings of refrigerators used for vaccine storage. Temperatures were recorded continuously using a standardised data logger with an accuracy of ±0.4 °C. The prevalence rates of refrigerators within the target range (2 to 8 °C) and of those reaching critically low temperatures (≤0 °C) were calculated. In addition, the cumulative time and the duration of single episodes beyond the target range were computed. To assess for structural deficits, the prevalence of refrigerators with a cycling of >5 °C was determined. Generalised linear mixed models were applied to analyse correlating factors between the dependent variables ‘within temperature range’ and ‘reaching critically low temperatures’ with practice characteristics. Results The study included 64 of 168 practices (38.1% response rate) with 75 refrigerators. The prevalence of refrigerators with temperatures within the target range was 32.0% (n = 24), and 14.7% (n = 11) reached critically low temperatures <0 °C. 44.0% of refrigerators (n = 33) showed temperatures >8 °C and 28.0% (n = 21) <2 °C. Of the 168 hours recorded per refrigerator, the average cumulative time >8 °C was 49 hours, <2 °C 75 hours and ≤0 °C 74 hours. The longest consecutive period of critically low temperatures was 168 hours (mean: 39±53). The prevalence of refrigerators with a cycling range of >5 °C was 29.3%. Conclusion Given the importance of immunisation, the results of our study call for action, as two-thirds of the refrigerators exhibited cold chain breaches and 15% reached critically low temperatures threatening vaccine potency."
https://openalex.org/W2990630055,"In Cambodia, the age-standardized prevalence of diabetes mellitus has increased in both men and women. The main objective of this study was to identify factors associated with diabetes medication adherence among people with diabetes mellitus in poor urban areas of Phnom Penh, Cambodia.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 using a structured questionnaire for face-to-face interviews by trained interviewers. The participants were people with diabetes mellitus who were the active members of a peer educator network, lived in poor urban areas of Phnom Penh, and attended weekly educational sessions during the survey period. Diabetes medication adherence was measured using four items of modified Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Participants were classified into two groups based on their adherence score: 0 (high adherence) and from 1 to 4 (medium or low adherence). Sociodemographic characteristics; medical history; accessibility to health services; and knowledge, attitude, and practices related to diabetes mellitus were examined. A multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted adjusting for sex, age, marital status, and education levels.Data from 773 people with diabetes were included in the analyses. Of the total, 49.3% had a high level of diabetes medication adherence. A high level of adherence was associated with higher family income (≥50 USD per month) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.25-11.08), absence of diabetes mellitus-related complications (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.19-2.32), use of health services more than once per month (AOR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.64-5.04), following special diet for diabetes mellitus (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.17-2.81), and absence of alcohol consumption (AOR = 13.67, 95% CI = 2.86-65.34).High diabetes medication adherence was associated with better family economic conditions, absence of diabetes mellitus-related complications, and healthy behaviors. It would be crucial to improve affordable access to regular follow-ups including promotion of healthy behaviors through health education and control of diabetes mellitus-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W2990713450,"3D-printing is a powerful manufacturing tool that can create precise microscale architectures across macroscale geometries. Within biomedical research, 3D-printing of various materials has been used to fabricate rigid scaffolds for cell and tissue engineering constructs with precise microarchitecture to direct cell behavior and macroscale geometry provides patient specificity. While 3D-printing hardware has become low-cost due to modeling and rapid prototyping applications, there is no common paradigm or platform for the controlled design and manufacture of 3D-printed constructs for tissue engineering. Specifically, controlling the tissue engineering features of pore size, porosity, and pore arrangement is difficult using currently available software. We have developed a MATLAB approach termed scafSLICR to design and manufacture tissue-engineered scaffolds with precise microarchitecture and with simple options to enable spatially patterned pore properties. Using scafSLICR, we designed, manufactured, and characterized porous scaffolds in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene with a variety of pore sizes, porosities, and gradients. We found that transitions between different porous regions maintained an open, connected porous network without compromising mechanical integrity. Further, we demonstrated the usefulness of scafSLICR in patterning different porous designs throughout large anatomic shapes and in preparing craniofacial tissue engineering bone scaffolds. Finally, scafSLICR is distributed as open-source MATLAB scripts and as a stand-alone graphical interface."
https://openalex.org/W2983105067,"Archaeosine (G+), 7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine, is an archaea-specific modified nucleoside found at the 15th position of tRNAs. In Euryarchaeota, 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine (preQ0)-containing tRNA (q0N-tRNA), synthesized by archaeal tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (ArcTGT), has been believed to be converted to G+-containing tRNA (G+-tRNA) by the paralog of ArcTGT, ArcS. However, we found that several euryarchaeal ArcSs have lysine transfer activity to q0N-tRNA to form q0kN-tRNA, which has a preQ0 lysine adduct as a base. Through comparative genomics and biochemical experiments, we found that ArcS forms a robust complex with a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme named RaSEA. The ArcS-RaSEA complex anaerobically converted q0N-tRNA to G+-tRNA in the presence of SAM and lysine via q0kN-tRNA. We propose that ArcS and RaSEA should be considered an archaeosine synthase α-subunit (lysine transferase) and β-subunit (q0kN-tRNA lyase), respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2984284332,"BRF1 is a rate-limiting factor for RNA Polymerase III-mediated transcription and is elevated in numerous cancers. Here, we report that elevated levels of BRF1 associate with poor prognosis in human prostate cancer. In vitro studies in human prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that transient overexpression of BRF1 increased cell proliferation whereas the transient downregulation of BRF1 reduced proliferation and mediated cell cycle arrest. Consistent with our clinical observations, BRF1 overexpression in a Pten-deficient mouse (PtenΔ/Δ BRF1Tg) prostate cancer model accelerated prostate carcinogenesis and shortened survival. In PtenΔ/Δ BRF1Tg tumours, immune and inflammatory processes were altered, with reduced tumoral infiltration of neutrophils and CD4 positive T cells, which can be explained by decreased levels of complement factor D (CFD) and C7 components of the complement cascade, an innate immune pathway that influences the adaptive immune response. We tested if the secretome was involved in BRF1-driven tumorigenesis. Unbiased proteomic analysis on BRF1-overexpresing PC3 cells confirmed reduced levels of CFD in the secretome, implicating the complement system in prostate carcinogenesis. We further identify that expression of C7 significantly correlates with expression of CD4 and has the potential to alter clinical outcome in human prostate cancer, where low levels of C7 associate with poorer prognosis."

https://openalex.org/W2990457100,"Routinely crossing international borders and/or persisting in populations across multiple countries, species are commonly subject to a patchwork of endangered species legislation. Canada and the United States share numerous endangered species; their respective acts, the Species at Risk Act (SARA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), require documents that outline requirements for species recovery. Although there are many priorities for improving endangered species legislation effectiveness, species recovery goals are a crucial component. We compared recovery goal quality, as measured by goal quantitativeness and ambition, for species listed under SARA and ESA. By comparing across ESA and SARA, the intent of the study was to identify differences and similarities that could support the development of stronger species' recovery goals under both legislations. Our results indicated that: (1) overall, only 38% of recovery goals were quantitative, 41% had high ambition, and 26% were both quantitative and with high ambition; (2) recovery goals had higher quantitativeness and ambition under ESA than SARA; (3) recovery goals for endangered species had higher ambition than threatened species under ESA and SARA, and; (4) no recovery goal aimed to restore populations to historic levels. Combined, these findings provide guidance to strengthen recovery goals and improve subsequent conservation outcomes. In particular, species at risk planners should seek to attain higher recovery goal ambition, particularly for SARA-listed species, and include quantitative recovery goals wherever possible."
https://openalex.org/W2990788536,"When learning a new motor behavior, e.g. reaching in a force field, the nervous system builds an internal representation. Examining how subsequent reaches in unpracticed directions generalize reveals this representation. Although often studied, it is not known how this representation changes across training directions, or how changes in reach direction and the corresponding changes in limb impedance, influence these measurements. We ran a force field adaptation experiment using eight groups of subjects each trained on one of eight standard directions and then tested for generalization in the remaining seven directions. Generalization in all directions was local and asymmetric, providing limited and unequal transfer to the left and right side of the trained target. These asymmetries were not consistent in either magnitude or direction, even after correcting for changes in limb impedance. Relying on a standard model for generalization the inferred representations inconsistently shifted to one side or the other of their respective training direction. A second model that accounted for limb impedance and variations in baseline trajectories explained more data and the inferred representations were centered on their respective training directions. Our results highlight the influence of limb mechanics and impedance on psychophysical measurements and their interpretations for motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2991321022,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of treating skeletal muscle cells with media conditioned by postprandial ex vivo human serum fed with either isonitrogenous Non-Essential Amino Acid (NEAA) or a whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) on stimulating Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells.Blood was taken from six young healthy males following overnight fast (fasted) and 60 min postprandial (fed) ingestion of either WPH or NEAA (0.33 g.kg-1 Body Mass). C2C12 myotubes were treated with media conditioned by ex vivo human serum (20%) for 4 h. Activation of MPS signalling (phosphorylation of mTOR, P70S6K and 4E-BP1) were determined in vitro by Western Blot and subsequent MPS were determined in vitro by Western Blot and surface sensing of translation technique (SUnSET) techniques, respectively.Media conditioned by NEAA fed serum had no effect on protein signalling or MPS compared to fasted, whereas media conditioned by WPH fed serum significantly increased mTOR (Ser2448), P70S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (p<0.01, p<0.05) compared to fasted serum. Furthermore, the effect of media conditioned by WPH fed serum on protein signalling and MPS was significantly increased (p<0.01, p<0.05) compared to NEAA fed serum.In summary, media conditioned by NEAA fed serum did not result in activation of MPS. Therefore, these in vitro findings suggest the use of isonitrogenous NEAA acts as an effective control for comparing bioactivity of different proteins on activation of MPS."
https://openalex.org/W2989617921,"Prostate biopsies are frequently performed to screen for prostate cancer (PCa) with complications such as infections and bleeding. To reduce unnecessary biopsies, here we designed an improved predictive model of MRI-based prostate volume and associated zone-adjusted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations for diagnosing PCa and risk stratification. Multiparametric MRI administered to 422 consecutive patients before initial transrectal ultrasonography-guided 13-core prostate biopsies from January 2012 to March 2018 at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and determination of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to evaluate and integrate the predictors of PCa and high-risk prostate cancer (HR-PCa). The detection rates of PCa was 43.84% (185/422). And the detection rates of HR-PCa was 71.35% (132/185) in PCa patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that prostate volume(PV), PSA density(PSAD), transitional zone volume(TZV), PSA density of the transitional zone(PSADTZ), and MR were independent predictors of PCa and HR-PCa. PSA, peripheral zone volume(PZV) and PSA density of the peripheral zone(PSADPZ) were independent predictors of PCa but not HR-PCa. The AUC of our best predictive model including PSA + PV + PSAD + MR + TZV or PSA + PV + PSAD + MR + PZV was 0.906 for PCa. The AUC of the best predictive model of PV + PSAD + MR + TZV was 0.893 for HR-PCa. In conclusion, our results will likely improve the detection rate of prostate cancer, avoiding unnecessary prostate biopsies, and for evaluating risk stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2990289367,"Sustainable development of agricultural lands in arid environments is limited by soil salinization. Comprehensive measures were conducted to completely improve soil salinization in this study. For the purpose of assessing the effect of comprehensive improvement in salinized farmland in arid zone, soil salinity at a range of soil depths, EC of subsurface pipe drainage and crop yield during crop growth period in Xinjiang, China were investigated. The results show that soil salinity decreased significantly on mildly (1-3 dS m-1) and moderately (3-6 dS m-1) salinized farmlands. The improvement in moderately salinized soil was better than that in mildly salinized soil. The average desalinization rate of mildly and moderately salinized farmland was 15% and -15.8%, respectively. The more irrigation times were, the better desalinization effect became. The EC of drainage water varied in the range of 7.53-11.16 dS m-1 and was greater than the EC of irrigation water, which showed that subsurface pipe drainage can remove soil salinity from salinized farmlands. The crop yield using comprehensive improvement increased significantly compared with the control check. The outcome of this study suggests that comprehensive measures on salinized farmland are conductive to the decrease of soil salinity and the increase of crop yield."

The supply of iron from the ventral hippocampus to the middle prefrontal cortex subserved an anxiolytic phenotype and mediated the neuropharmacological actions of diazepam and lithium chloride in rodent models."
https://openalex.org/W2989923042,"Natural flora is the richest source of novel therapeutic agents due to their immense chemical diversity and novel biological properties. In this regard, eighteen natural products belonging to different chemical classes were evaluated for their thymidine phosphorylase (TP) inhibitory activity. TP shares identity with an angiogenic protein platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF). It assists tumor angiogenesis and is a key player in cancer progression, thus an ideal target to develop anti-angiogenic drugs. Eleven compounds 1–2, 5–10, 11, 15, and 18 showed a good to weak TP inhibitory activity (IC50 values between 44.0 to 420.3 μM), as compared to standards i.e. tipiracil (IC50 = 0.014 ± 0.002 μM) and 7-deazaxanthine (IC50 = 41.0 ± 1.63 μM). Kinetic studies were also performed on active compounds, in order to deduce the mechanism of ligand binding to enzyme. To get further insight into receptor protein (enzyme) and ligand interaction at atomic level, in- sillico studies were also performed. Active compounds were finally evaluated for cytotoxicity test against mouse fibroblast (3T3) cell line. Compound 18 (Masoprocol) showed a significant TP inhibitory activity (IC50 = 44.0 ± 0.5 μM). Kinetic studies showed that it inhibits the enzyme in a competitive manner (Ki = 25.6 ± 0.008 μM), while it adopts a binding pose different than the substrate thymidine. It is further found to be non-toxic in MTT cytotoxicity assay. This is the first report on TP inhibitory activity of several natural compounds, some of which may serve as leads for further research towards drug the development."
https://openalex.org/W2991207286,"Male-pattern baldness (MPB) is characterized by a progressive hair loss from the frontal and vertex scalp that affects about 80% of men at the age of 80 years. Epidemiological studies show positive associations between MPB and coronary heart disease (CHD) and CHD related risk factors such as blood pressure (BP), diabetes mellitus (DM) or elevated blood lipid levels. The results however vary with regard to the pattern of hair loss (i.e. moderate, severe, frontal or vertex). Further, no study has investigated for a shared genetic determinant between MPB and CHD as well as CHD related risk factors. Using the longitudinal data from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study we aimed to systematically investigate the association between MPB and incident CHD and CHD risk factors on (i) an epidemiological (N = 1,673 males) and (ii) a genetic (N = 1,357 males) level. The prevalence of any baldness in our study population was 88% (mean age ± SD: 64±7.5 years). Compared to men with ‘no baldness’, in men with any kind of baldness a slightly increased risk for CHD (Hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (95%CI)] = 1.2 [0.8; 1.9]), a slightly higher extend of coronary artery calcification (CAC) (Beta [95%CI] = 0.2 [-0.1; 0.6]), a moderately increased risk for DM (prevalence ratio [95%CI] = 1.4 [0.9; 2.0]) and higher body mass index (BMI) (Beta [95%CI] = 0.6 [0.00003; 1.2]) seem to be indicated in the adjusted model. In contrast, the MPB genetic risk score did not show any association with CHD or CHD risk factors. Taken together, the results of our study suggest a weak association between MPB and a few CHD risk factors (CAC, DM and BMI) but do not point to MPB as a strong surrogate measure for CHD and CHD risk factors in general."
https://openalex.org/W2990576456,"This study was aimed to examine the effect of feeding patterns on growth and nutritional status of children aged 0~24 months.We conducted a cohort study with an initial sample of 927 children. Considering the follow-up losses, 903, 897, 895, 897, 883, 827 and 750 children were followed up at 1, 3, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months, respectively. Children were grouped according to exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) duration in the first 6 months: (1) never EBF; (2) EBF ≤ 3 months: EBF ≤ 3 months and stopped BF after 3 months or EBF ≤ 3 months and BF = 6 months or EBF ≤ 3 months and BF after 3 months, had formula and/or solids; (3) EBF for 3 ~ 6 months: BF < 3 months and EBF for 3 ~ 6 months or EBF for 3 ~ 6 months and BF < 3 months, had formula and/or solids; (4) EBF = 6 months. We used Z-scores to evaluate the growth and nutritional status of children, used the generalized estimation equation to compare the difference between feeding patterns.The generalized estimation equation results showed that Weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), Length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), and Weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ) in different feeding patterns had statistical significance. The WAZ in EBF for 6 months group was higher in the first 8 months, in never EBF group was higher after 12 months old; the LAZ in EBF for 6 month group was lower than other groups; the WLZ in EBF for 6 months group was higher than EBF for 3 ~ 6 months group. The EBF ≤ 3 months group had higher underweight, stunting, and wasting rates. The EBF for 6 months had a higher stunting rate; the never EBF and EBF for 6 months groups had higher overweight and obesity rates.In conclusion, different feeding patterns affect growth and nutritional status in children, so proper guidelines should be implemented to improve nutritional status and promote the growth of children."

This study aimed to develop a new oral paclitaxel formulation (DHP23002) and to evaluate its absorption and antitumor effects in a pancreatic tumor mouse model.


Methods 
To investigate the oral absorption of DHP23002, a newly developed lipid-based orally active paclitaxel formulation, a pharmacokinetic study of DHP23002, was conducted in mice (62.5 and 125 mg/kg). Moreover, to evaluate the antitumor effect of DHP23002 in pancreatic cancer treatment, the drug was administered to female athymic nude mice at 0 (vehicle), 25, 62.5, and 125 mg/kg on alternate days; the efficacy of the agent was compared with the efficacy of intravenous Taxol® injections at 10 mg/kg once per week. After 3 weeks of administration, tumor growth in mice belonging to each group was further monitored for 4 weeks after discontinuing medication. Moreover, to examine paclitaxel (DHP23002) accumulation in the tumor tissue, the amount of paclitaxel in tumor/blood was quantified using liquid chromatography with quadruple-TOF mass spectrometry.


Results 
In the mouse pharmacokinetic study, oral Taxol® showed a negligible absorption, whereas DHP23002 showed a high absorption rate dependent on dosage, with a bioavailability of approximately 40% at a dose of 62.5 mg/kg. In efficacy-related studies, DHP23002 administration at a dose of 25, 62.5, or 125 mg/kg on alternate days for 3 weeks showed a superior tumor inhibitory effect of 80%, 92%, and 97% in a xenograft mouse model, respectively, after 7 weeks. Paclitaxel accumulation in tumors persisted for >24 h in mice, when orally administered once at doses of 25, 62.5, and 125 mg/kg DHP23002.


Conclusion 
Oral chemotherapy with DHP23002 showed excellent absorption in animals owing to a strong antitumor activity in a pancreatic cancer mouse model. This demonstrates that paclitaxel is largely distributed and persists for a prolonged period at the tumor site owing to oral DHP23002 administration."

https://openalex.org/W2990975269,"Objective: To derive a closed-form analytical solution to the swing equation describing the power system dynamics, which is a nonlinear second order differential equation. Existing challenges: No analytical solution to the swing equation has been identified, due to the complex nature of power systems. Two major approaches are pursued for stability assessments on systems: (1) computationally simple models based on physically unacceptable assumptions, and (2) digital simulations with high computational costs. Motivation: The motion of the rotor angle that the swing equation describes is a vector function. Often, a simple form of the physical laws is revealed by coordinate transformation. Methods: The study included the formulation of the swing equation in the Cartesian coordinate system, which is different from conventional approaches that describe the equation in the polar coordinate system. Based on the properties and operational conditions of electric power grids referred to in the literature, we identified the swing equation in the Cartesian coordinate system and derived an analytical solution within a validity region. Results: The estimated results from the analytical solution derived in this study agree with the results using conventional methods, which indicates the derived analytical solution is correct. Conclusion: An analytical solution to the swing equation is derived without unphysical assumptions, and the closed-form solution correctly estimates the dynamics after a fault occurs."
