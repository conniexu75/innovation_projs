https://openalex.org/W2050725524,"The brain receives sensory input from diverse peripheral tissues, including the skin, the body's largest sensory organ. Using genetically encoded axonal tracers expressed from the Mrgprd locus, we identify a subpopulation of nonpeptidergic, nociceptive neurons that project exclusively to the skin, and to no other peripheral tissue examined. Surprisingly, Mrgprd(+) innervation is restricted to the epidermis and absent from specialized sensory structures. Furthermore, Mrgprd(+) fibers terminate in a specific layer of the epidermis, the stratum granulosum. This termination zone is distinct from that innervated by most CGRP(+) neurons, revealing that peptidergic and nonpeptidergic epidermal innervation is spatially segregated. The central projections deriving from these distinct epidermal innervation zones terminate in adjacent laminae in the dorsal spinal cord. Thus, afferent input from different layers of the epidermis is conveyed by topographically segregated sensory circuits, suggesting that at least some aspects of sensory information processing may be organized along labeled lines."
https://openalex.org/W2005234042,"The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors of Plasmodium falciparum have been proposed to be the major factors that contribute to malaria pathogenesis through their ability to induce proinflammatory responses. In this study we identified the receptors for P. falciparum GPI-induced cell signaling that leads to proinflammatory responses and studied the GPI structure-activity relationship. The data show that GPI signaling is mediated mainly through recognition by TLR2 and to a lesser extent by TLR4. The activity of sn-2-lyso-GPIs is comparable with that of the intact GPIs, whereas the activity of Man3-GPIs is about 80% that of the intact GPIs. The GPIs with three (intact GPIs and Man3-GPIs) and two fatty acids (sn-2-lyso-GPIs) appear to differ considerably in the requirement of the auxiliary receptor, TLR1 or TLR6, for recognition by TLR2. The former are preferentially recognized by TLR2/TLR1, whereas the latter are favored by TLR2/TLR6. However, the signaling pathways initiated by all three GPI types are similar, involving the MyD88-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 and NF-κB-signaling pathways. The signaling molecules of these pathways differentially contribute to the production of various cytokines and nitric oxide (Zhu, J., Krishnegowda, G., and Gowda, D. C. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 8617-8627). Our data also show that GPIs are degraded by the macrophage surface phospholipases predominantly into inactive species, indicating that the host can regulate GPI activity at least in part by this mechanism. These results imply that macrophage surface phospholipases play important roles in the GPI-induced innate immune responses and malaria pathogenesis.

Malaria caused by the parasitic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium is a major public health problem in Africa, South America, and South Asia (1Gilles H.M. Warrell D.A.

The disease afflicts about 500 million people and causes ∼3 million deaths annually and ranks first among the various infectious diseases, causing global morbidity and mortality. More than 100 Plasmodium species exist in nature that can infect various vertebrate animals (1Gilles H.M. Warrell D.A. Bruce-Chawatt's Essential Malariology. Arnold Publishers, London1997: 1-340Google Scholar). However, only four species are infectious to man, and of these, Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for >95% of deaths (1Gilles H.M. Warrell D.A.

Plasmodium infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations, including cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, renal failure, and severe anemia (1Gilles H.M.

However, excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines could lead to severe pathological conditions (16Playfair J.H.L. Taverne J. Bate C.A. de Souza J.B. Immunol.

Therefore, understanding the mechanism of innate immune responses to P. falciparum factors could offer therapeutic targets for malaria. Although the various P. falciparum components that are potentially involved in the production of inflammatory responses by the innate immune system remain to be elucidated, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor glycolipids of the parasite have been proposed as the prominent parasite components responsible for malaria pathogenesis (20Schofield L. Hackett F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 21Schofield L. Vivas L. Hackett F. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Tachado S. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1993; 87: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence indicates that GPIs of parasitic protozoa contribute prominently to the pathology of parasitic diseases (22Ropert C. Gazzinelli T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The deleterious effects of the parasite GPIs have been attributed to their ability to induce TNF-α and other proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, which contribute to disease pathology (20Schofield L. Hackett F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 21Schofield L. Vivas L. Hackett F. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Tachado S. Ann. Trop. Med.

It has been shown that the level of TNF-α is markedly elevated in patients with fatal cerebral malaria, and anti-TNF-α antibodies prevent the development of cerebral malaria (23Kwiatkowski D. Hill A.V. Sambou I. Twumasi P. Castracane J. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Brewster D.R. Greenwood B.M. Lancet. 1990; 336: 1201-1204Abstract PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). GPIs consist of a conserved glycan structure, ethanolamine-phosphate-6Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcN, α(1-6)-linked to the PI (24Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 26Ferguson M.A.J.

GPIs are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, where they are primarily involved in anchoring certain cell surface proteins to plasma membranes. Compared with animal cells, GPIs are abundantly expressed in parasites, such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania, and Plasmodium. Therefore, in these parasites a relatively large pool of GPIs is no longer anchored to proteins and appears to be the direct target of the host innate immune system for inducing proinflammatory responses (22Ropert C. Gazzinelli T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). GPIs from different species differ in the type of acyl/alkyl substituents, the presence of additional sugar moieties on the third and/or first mannose, extra ethanolamine phosphate groups on the carbohydrate moiety, and acyl substituent on C2 of inositol, leading to a broad structural diversity and variation in potency of their biological activity (28Almeida I.G. Gazzinelli T.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gowda D.C. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GPIs of P. falciparum have been shown to activate protein-tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C, which together regulate the activation of NF-κB/c-Rel transcription factor with the downstream expression of proinflammatory responses (30Schofield L. Novakovic S. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. McConville M.J. Tachado S.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1886-1896PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tachado S.D. Gerold P. McConville M.J. Baldwin T. Quilici D. Schwarz R.T.

A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the receptors that mediate P. falciparum GPI signaling and how the exogenously induced signal is transmitted into the cells has remained unclear. Research during the past few years has shown that the innate immune responses to various microbial pathogens are mediated by a family of signal-transducing proteins called TLRs (33Takeda K. kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar, 34Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35Takeda K. Akira S. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2004; 34: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To date, 13 TLRs, TLR1 through TLR13, have been identified in mammalian cells, most recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (36Tabeta K. Georgel P. Janssen E. Du X. Hoebe K. Crozat K. Mudd S. Shamel L. Sovath S. Goode J. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3516-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). For example, TLR4 recognizes enterobacterial LPS, TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA, TLR5 recognizes flagellin, and TLR9 recognizes CpG-containing motifs of bacterial DNA. TLR2, however, exhibits broad ligand recognition, and the identified ligands include peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, lipoproteins, lipoarabinomannan, zymosan, certain glycolipids, non-enterobacterial LPS, and porins (33Takeda K. kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar, 34Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35Takeda K. Akira S. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2004; 34: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Efficient signal transduction by TLR2 appears to require its heterodimerization with either TLR1 (for triacylated lipoproteins) or TLR6 (for diacylated lipoproteins) (33Takeda K. kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar, 37Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 38Akira S. Hemmi H. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 85: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The transmission of responses by TLRs involves in most cases the recruitment of a shared adaptor protein, MyD88, which interacts with TLRs through Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains, initiating signaling cascades, engaging various MAPKs and NF-κB (39Barton G.M. Madzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Thus far there have been no direct studies demonstrating TLR-mediated immune responses to P. falciparum ligands, although MyD88-deficient mice have been reported to be protected from Plasmodium berghei-induced IL-12-mediated liver injury, suggesting involvement of TLR-mediated immune responses to malarial factors (40Adachi K. Tsutsui H. Kashiwamura S. Seki E. Nakano H. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Okumura K. Van Kaer L. Okamura H. Akira S. Nakanishi K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5928-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recently, GPI moieties of the mucin-type glycoproteins of Trypanosoma cruzi trypamastigotes have been shown to induce proinflammatory responses through TLR2-mediated signaling (41Ropert C. Almeida I.C. Closel M. Travassos L.R. Ferguson M.A. Cohen P. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3423-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 42Campos M.A. Almeida I.C. Takeuchi O.

However, P. falciparum GPIs are structurally distinct from those of T. cruzi; the former contain a diacylated glycerol moiety and fatty acid acylation at C-2 of inositol, whereas the latter have sn-1-alkyl-sn-2-acylglycerol and lack inositol acylation (29Gowda D.C. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Gerold P. Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Schwarz R.T. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the requirement of TLR1 or TLR6 for heterodimerization with TLR2 for signaling by GPIs is not known. In this study we show that proinflammatory responses to P. falciparum GPIs by macrophages are mediated mainly through TLR2 and to a lesser but significant extent also through TLR4. We also show for the first time that the parasite GPIs are degraded by macrophage surface phospholipase A2 and phospholipase D and that intact and sn-2-lyso-GPIs are differentially recognized by TLR2/TLR1 and TLR2/TLR6.

The suspension was centrifuged and washed several times, and the erythrocyte debris was removed by centrifugation on a 5% bovine serum albumin cushion. The parasites were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, lyophilized, and stored at -80 °C. The parasites (from 10 ml wet pellet) were extracted 3 times with chloroform, methanol (2:1, v/v) to remove non-glycosylated lipids. GPIs were extracted with chloroform, methanol, water (10:10:3, v/v/v), dried, and partitioned between water and water-saturated 1-butanol. The organic layer was washed four times with water and dried. The residue was extracted with 80% aqueous 1-propanol and dried and the GPIs were further purified by HPLC using C4 Supelcosil LC-304 column (4.6 × 250 cm, Supelco) as described previously (45). In some experiments GPIs were further purified by HPTLC using chloroform, methanol, water (10:10:2.4, v/v/v). The HPLC and HPTLC-purified GPIs were found to be free from endotoxin as tested by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (50Sakai H. Hisamoto S. Fukutomi I. Sou K. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. J. Pharm. Sci. 2004; 93: 310-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By this assay (with positive detection limit of 0.01 ng/ml for LPS standard), 5 μg/ml GPIs showed negative endotoxin activity. The purity of the GPIs was confirmed by mass spectrometry and carbohydrate compositional analysis. The GPIs were quantified by determining the amount of GlcN and Man after acid hydrolysis and HPLC as described previously (45Naik R.S. Branch O.H. Woods A.S. Vijaykumar M. Perkins D.J. Nahlen B.L.

Preparation of Man3-GPIs—The Man4-GPIs (10 μg) were treated with jack bean α-mannosidase (40 units/ml) in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm Zn2+, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% sodium taurodeoxycholate at 37 °C for 24 h (51Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1465-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The solutions were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, cooled, and extracted with water-saturated 1-butanol, washed 4 times with water, and dried. The Man3-GPIs were purified by HPLC as above, and the purity of the samples was ascertained by mass spectrometry and by the carbohydrate compositional analysis. Preparation of sn-2-lyso-GPIs—The GPIs (10 μg) were treated with bee venom phospholipase A2 (1700 unit/ml) in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 24 h (44Gerold P.

The solution was heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, cooled, and extracted with water-saturated 1-butanol, washed 4 times with water, and dried. The sn-2-lyso-GPIs were purified by HPLC as above, and the purity was determined by mass spectrometry and by carbohydrate compositional analysis (45Naik R.S. Branch O.H. Woods A.S. Vijaykumar M.

Mass Spectrometry—The solutions of GPIs in chloroform, methanol, and water (8:4:3, v/v/v) were mixed with equal volumes of a saturated solution of 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% ethanol, deposited on the sample plate, and air-dried. Mass spectra (an average of 50 shots) were acquired in linear negative ion mode on a DE-PRO matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PE-Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) at 20-kV accelerating voltage. Carbohydrate Compositional Analysis—The GPIs (∼1 μg each) were hydrolyzed with 400 μl of either 2.5 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 5 h or 3 m HCl at 100 °C for 4 h. The hydolysates were dried in a Speed-Vac, dissolved in water, and analyzed on a CarboPac PA10 high pH anion-exchange column (2 × 250 mm) using a Dionex BioLC GS50 HPLC system coupled to a ID50 electrochemical detector (52Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The elution was performed with 16 mm sodium hydroxide, and the response factors for the monosaccharides were determined using standard sugar solutions. Coating of GPIs to Gold Particles—The colloidal gold suspension (1.5 ml) was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 8000 rpm and washed 3 times with endotoxin-free water. The particle pellet thus obtained (∼8 μl) was suspended in 120 μl of water and mixed with GPIs (5 μg) in 30 μl of 80% 1-propanol and dried in a Speed-Vac. By adding a known amount of [3H]GlcN-labeled GPIs during coating, we found that the GPIs are quantitatively adsorbed by the gold particles. The GPI-coated gold particles were suspended in 13 ml of DMEM, 10% FBS and used for stimulation of macrophages in 24- or 96-well microtiter plates. Preparation of Mouse Bone Marrow Macrophages and Human Peripheral Blood Monocytes and Stimulation with GPIs—Mouse macrophages were obtained by the differentiation of primary bone marrow cells with 30% of L929 cell-conditioned medium as described (53Zhu J. Krishnegowda G. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8617-8627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The macrophages were plated into 96-well plates (2.5 × 104 cells/well), and after 24 h, the culture supernatants were removed and incubated with the indicated amounts of GPIs in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For human monocytes, the whole blood was diluted with 3 volumes of RPMI 1640 medium, and 4 volumes of cell suspension was layered on 1 volume of isolymph and centrifuged at 1300 rpm at room temperature for 30 min. The buffy layer at the interface was recovered, washed 2 times with RPMI 1640 medium, and then suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (2.5 × 1"
https://openalex.org/W2036744872,"Dysregulation of central serotonin neurotransmission has been widely suspected as an important contributor to major depression. Here, we identify a (G1463A) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the rate-limiting enzyme of neuronal serotonin synthesis, human tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (hTPH2). The functional SNP in hTPH2 replaces the highly conserved Arg441 with His, which results in ∼80% loss of function in serotonin production when hTPH2 is expressed in PC12 cells. Strikingly, SNP analysis in a cohort of 87 patients with unipolar major depression revealed that nine patients carried the mutant (1463A) allele, while among 219 controls, three subjects carried this mutation. In addition, this functional SNP was not found in a cohort of 60 bipolar disorder patients. Identification of a loss-of-function mutation in hTPH2 suggests that defect in brain serotonin synthesis may represent an important risk factor for unipolar major depression."
https://openalex.org/W2067561562,"Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) has been shown to be an extremely potent negative regulator of smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that the Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) 4 potently represses the expression of multiple SMC genes. However, the mechanisms whereby KLF4 suppresses SMC gene expression are not known, nor is it clear whether KLF4 contributes to PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC genes. The goals of the present studies were to determine the molecular mechanisms by which KLF4 represses expression of SMC genes and whether it contributes to PDGF-BB-induced suppression of these genes. Results demonstrated that KLF4 markedly repressed both myocardin-induced activation of SMC genes and expression of myocardin. KLF4 was rapidly up-regulated in PDGF-BB-treated, cultured SMC, and a small interfering RNA to KLF4 partially blocked PDGF-BB-induced SMC gene repression. Both PDGF-BB and KLF4 markedly reduced serum response factor binding to CArG containing regions within intact chromatin. Finally, KLF4, which is normally not expressed in differentiated SMC in vivo, was rapidly up-regulated in vivo in response to vascular injury. Taken together, results indicate that KLF4 represses SMC genes by both down-regulating myocardin expression and preventing serum response factor/myocardin from associating with SMC gene promoters, and suggest that KLF4 may be a key effector of PDGF-BB and injury-induced phenotypic switching of SMC.

Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar, 2Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19470) Google Scholar). A hallmark feature of this phenotypic switching is coordinate repression of the expression of the normal repertoire of genes that distinguish differentiated mature SMC from other cell types. However, the mechanisms that regulate this process are very poorly understood. Indeed, major challenges for the field have been to define regulatory cis-elements within the promoter enhancer regions of SMC marker genes, such as SM α-actin, SM22α, and SM myosin heavy chain, to identify factors that bind and regulate the activity of these regulatory regions and to elucidate environmental factors/cues that influence these regulatory processes in response to tissue injury and/or pathological circumstances. The model that has emerged is that regulation of SMC differentiation is extremely complex and involves constant interplay between environmental cues and the genetic program that controls the coordinate expression of genes characteristic of the SMC lineage (reviewed by Owens et al. (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar)). It is of particular interest that expression of virtually all SMC marker genes characterized to date is dependent on CArG box elements and SRF (reviewed by Miano (3Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar)). Moreover, an especially exciting recent discovery was the demonstration (by our laboratory and others (4Yoshida T. Sinha S. Dandre F. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Kremer B.E. Wang D.Z. Olson E.N.

Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) that the SMC/cardiac myocyte-restricted SRF co-activator myocardin is required for the expression of multiple SMC marker genes by inducing CArG/SRF-dependent transcription of SMC genes in SMC and many embryonic stem cells/fibroblasts and, most importantly, that it is necessary for SMC differentiation in vivo. However, so far, it is not clear whether down-regulation of SMC marker genes associated with phenotypic switching is due to the decreased expression of a transcriptional activator, such as myocardin, and/or stimulation of the expression of cell-selective gene repressors. The most potent and efficacious inhibitor of SMC differentiation identified to date is PDGF-BB (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Indeed, a series of studies by our laboratory and others demonstrated that treatment of cultured SMC with PDGF-BB was associated with profound selective down-regulation of SMC gene expression through a combination of transcriptional (9Van P.V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and post-transcriptional mechanisms (10Corjay M.H. Blank R.S. Owens G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Blank R.S. Owens G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Holycross B.J. Blank R.S. Thompson M.M. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is of particular significance that we also demonstrated that these effects were not a direct function of the mitogenic properties of PDGF-BB, in that chronic treatment of cultured SMC with PDGF-BB in post-confluent cultures was associated with sustained, but reversible, repression of SMC gene expression in the absence of sustained mitogenesis (11Blank R.S. Owens G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that PDGF-BB could induce suppression of SMC marker genes at concentrations that were 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than that required to induce maximal mitogenesis (11Blank R.S. Owens G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given that PDGF-BB levels are increased dramatically following vascular injury (13Golden M.A. Au Y.P.

Gordon D. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized, although not yet proven, that PDGF-BB is a key mediator of SMC phenotypic switching in response to vascular injury in vivo. Surprisingly, however, despite the fact that it has been over a decade since we first demonstrated the differentiation repressing activity of PDGF-BB in cultured SMC, virtually nothing is known as to how it mediates this effect. Of interest, based on a yeast one-hybrid screen for factors that bound to a novel TGFβ control element (TCE) found just 3′ to a required CArG element within the SM α-actin promoter, we identified a potent repressor of SMC gene expression termed KLF4. This Kruppel-like factor potently inhibited the expression of multiple SMC promoter-reporter genes in co-transfection studies (15Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, KLF4 was not expressed in SMC tissues in vivo based on either in situ (16Garrett-Sinha L.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); and it is unknown whether KLF4 is up-regulated in response to PDGF-BB in vitro or injury in vivo. The goals of the present studies were: 1) to determine molecular mechanisms whereby KLF4 inhibits expression of SMC marker genes, including testing the hypothesis that it interferes with CArG/SRF/myocardin-dependent gene expression and recruitment of SRF to CArG containing regions of SMC genes within intact chromatin and 2) to determine whether KLF4 expression is induced by treatment of cultured SMC with PDGF-BB and/or within phenotypically modulated SMC in vivo following vessel injury. Cell Cultures and Stimulation of SMC by PDGF-BB—Rat aortic SMC and NIH3T3 were cultured as described previously (17Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 200 μg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). SMCs were plated at 1.5 × 104/cm2 and starved the next day with serum-free medium, ISFM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with 200 μg/ml l-glutamines, 6.25 ng/ml sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 200 μm ascorbic acid). Roughly 16–17 h after starvation, SMCs were treated with 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Upstate Biotechnology) or vehicle (10 mm acetic acid and 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) for different time points (18Dandre F. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H2042-H2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Treating SMCs with cycloheximide (Sigma) was described previously (19Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S.

KLF4 siRNA construct (pM-KLF4) was generated by inserting a siRNA-generating sequence against KLF4 after a mouse H1 promoter in the pMighty vector. 2M. H. Hoofnagle and G. K. Owens, unpublished data. Transient Transfection and Infection—Cultured NIH3T3 cells were transfected with reporter PPI-Luc or PPITCE-Luc and effectors pcDNA-KLF4, pcDNA-SRF, pcDNA-KLF5, and/or pcDNA-FLAG-myocardin in triplicate using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were incubated 48 h before harvesting. The cultured SMCs were fed with fresh serum-free medium (ISFM), and transfected with PPI-Luc and pM-KLF4 in triplicate using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions 1 day after plating. Between 20 and 21 h after transfection, the SMCs were treated with PDGF-BB (Upstate Biotechnology) or vehicle for 24 h. The transfected cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with luciferase assay substrate (Promega) and was normalized to total protein (Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent, Pierce). Transfections were repeated at least three times, and the relative luciferase activities were presented as mean ± S.E. COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA-FLAG-KLF4 and pCGN-SRF or pCGN-dnSRF using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA supplemented with stock solution made with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). SMCs were infected with KLF4 adenovirus (Ad-CMV-KLF4) or control virus (Ad-CMV) 3 days after plating at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. The infection efficiency was demonstrated to be almost 100% based on infection with an EGFP expression adenovirus construct, i.e. Ad-CMV-EGFP (data not shown). Twenty-four hours after infection, SMCs were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and harvested with cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture solution and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation; or RNA samples were prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then subjected to real-time RT-PCR analyses as described previously (17Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The relative changes were presented as mean ± S.E. The experiments were repeated three times. RNA Preparation and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from PDGF-BB-stimulated or Ad-CMV-KLF4- or AD-CMV-myocardin-infected SMCs, and subjected to reverse transcription and real-time RT-PCR assays for KLF4, myocardin, SM α-actin, and SM MHC. The results were normalized against GAPDH or 18 S as described previously (17Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sequences for SM α-actin and SMC primers and probes were published previously (17Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the primers and probes for KLF4 and Myocardin are: KLF4-For, 5′-ctttcctgccagaccagatg-3′; KLF4-Rev, 5′-ggtttctcgcctgtgtgagt-3′; KLF4 probe, 5′-attatcaagagctcatgccaccggg-3′; myocardin-008, 5′-cggattcgaagctgttgtctt-3′; myocardin-009, 5′-aaaccaggccccctccc-3′; and myocardin probe, 5′-actctgacaccttgagatcatccaggtttgg-3′ (IDT). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Cell extract derived from transfected COS-7 cells or infected SMCs was precipitated with 5 μl of SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 3 μl of FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C, and antibody-protein complex was pulled down with protein A-agarose for 5 h at 4 °C. Precipitants were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 min, 4 °C, each time) before being eluted from agarose bead and then subjected to Western blotting analyses. Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The experiment procedure was described in detail by Wamhoff et al. (24Wamhoff B.R. Bowles D.K. McDonald O.G. Sinha S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were grown to the desired density on 100-mm plates and treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link protein/DNA and protein/protein interactions within intact chromatin. Chromatin was purified as described previously (25Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to shear chromatin fragments to 200–600 bp. The sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of immunoserum to SRF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), whereas negative control/input DNA was immunoprecipitated with no antibody, and immune complexes were recovered with agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology). Cross-links were reversed, chromatin subjected to proteinase K digestion to remove protein from the DNA, and the DNA was purified via phenol-chloroform extraction. Recovered DNA was quantitated by fluorescence with picogreen reagent (Molecular Probes) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Real-time PCR was performed on genomic DNA from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments as described in Litt et al. (26Litt M.D. Simpson M. Recillas-Targa F. Prioleau M.N. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2224-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Rat Carotid Injury—Balloon-injured Sprague-Dawley rat carotids and their uninjured contralateral control vessels were acquired from Zivic Miller Laboratories, Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA). Six samples were obtained at each time point (0, 1, 2, 6, and 24 h). The Fast Prep FP120 (Q-Biogene) was used to homogenize tissues, and the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to purify total RNA from independent samples. Gene expression in each injured vessel was normalized to its contralateral uninjured control carotid. KLF4 Dramatically Repressed SRF/Myocardin-induced Activation of SM α-Actin Promoter, and the Repression Could Be Rescued by Overexpression of SRF—Given that KLF4 was originally identified based on its binding to TCEs, which are found adjacent to CArG elements within SMC promoters (19Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that KLF4 may act, in part, through direct inhibition of SRF/CArG-dependent transcription. As an initial test of this hypothesis, cultured SMC was co-transfected with myocardin and with KLF4 in conjunction with the SM α-actin promoter-luciferase constructs. Consistent with previous reports, myocardin dramatically activated expression of the wild-type SM α-actin promoter inducing a nearly 600-fold increase (Fig. 1a) as compared with control constructs. Interestingly, although absolute transcription rates were decreased by mutation of the TCE, myocardin-induced activation was unaffected, eliciting a similar enhancement of expression over control groups as seen with the wild-type promoter. The activating effect of myocardin peaked with 0.4 μg of plasmid for both wild-type and TCE mutation promoter. It is of major interest that the results showed that overexpression of KLF4 virtually abolished myocardin-induced activation of the SM α-actin promoter (Fig. 1a). This effect was concentration-dependent in that increasing the myocardin plasmid concentration relative to the KLF4 plasmid concentration was associated with reduced KLF4-induced repression (Fig. 1b). Also of interest is that the repression of the activation by myocardin could be rescued by wild-type SRF (20Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) but not by SRF containing a mutated MADS domain (21Zhang X. Chai J. Azhar G. Sheridan P. Borras A.M.

(22Wang D.Z. Chang P.S. Wang Z.G. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) to be required for its binding to myocardin (Fig. 1c). KLF4 Specifically Bound to SRF in Immunoprecipitation Assays—The preceding results suggest that KLF4 and SRF may physically interact with each other. To assess this possibility, a series of immunoprecipitation assays were performed. Because no antibody is available that is completely specific for KLF4 and works in immunoprecipitation assays, we constructed a FLAG epitope-tagged KLF4 plasmid (pcDNA-FLAG-KLF4) and an adenovirus with which to overexpress a FLAG-tagged KLF4 (Ad-FLAG-KLF4). In this manner, we could perform both SRF immunoprecipitation assays, test for binding of FLAG-tagged KLF4, or perform KLF4 immunoprecipitation assays and test for the presence of SRF. Results showed that wild-type SRF (but not SRF containing a mutated MADS domain) specifically interacted with KLF4 within COS-7 cells (Fig. 2a). Subsequent experiments were then done to test for interaction between KLF4 and SRF within cell lysates derived from SMC infected by Ad-FLAG-KLF4. Results showed that the endogenous SRF bound to the FLAG epitope-tagged KLF4 in SMCs (Fig. 2b). The specificity of the association was confirmed by reciprocal precipitations with either SRF antibody or FLAG antibody. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that SRF bound to KLF4 and that the MADS domain of SRF was required for this binding. PDGF-BB Up-regulated KLF4 Expression in Cultured SMC, and Both PDGF-BB and KLF4 Repressed Myocardin Expression—Results of the current (Fig. 1) and previous studies (15Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) provide compelling evidence that KLF4 potently represses expression of multiple SMC differentiation marker genes. However, although KLF4 has the capacity to repress SMC genes, there was no direct evidence as to whether it actually contributes to SMC gene expression under either physiological or pathological circumstances. Interestingly, KLF4 is expressed in cultured SMCs that are known to be phenotypically switched (27Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar), but it is not normally expressed in fully differentiated SMC in vivo (15Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 16Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Because both PDGF-BB and KLF4 potently repress SMC marker genes in vitro (9Van P.V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Corjay M.H. Blank R.S. Owens G.K. J. Cell.

Blank R.S. Thompson M.M. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the effects of PDGF-BB might be mediated at least in part by the induction of KLF4. Consistent with this, results of real-time RT-PCR analyses showed that treatment of cultured SMC with PDGF-BB was associated with rapid induction of KLF4 mRNA expression. Indeed, expression was increased by 2-fold within 15 min of treatment, peaked at an increase of 5-fold at 45 min, and subsequently decreased to control levels by 8 h (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, treatment of cultured SMC with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide failed to block PDGF-BB-induced increases in KLF4 expression (Fig. 3b). Of major interest is that PDGF-BB induced marked repression of myocardin (Fig. 3c), with levels decreasing by 75% of levels in untreated control SMC at 4 h. These results suggest that PDGF-BB-induced expression of KLF4 may represent an early and direct effector pathway for PDGF-BB-induced repression of myocardin. In support of this, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of KLF4 dramatically repressed endogenous myocardin mRNA expression in SMCs, as measured by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 3d). Suppression of KLF4 Expression by Interference RNA Partially Blocked PDGF-BB-induced Down-regulation of SM α-Actin Promoter Activity—To directly test the role of KLF4 in PDGF-BB-induced repression of SMC marker genes in cultured SMCs, we constructed a unique KLF4 siRNA plasmid with which to inhibit PDGF-BB-induced expression of KLF4. The plasmid contains a mouse H1 promoter driving the expression of siRNA targeted to KLF4. Because an antibody to KLF4 is not available, the efficacy of the KLF4 siRNA plasmid was documented by Western blot analysis of the effects of the KLF4 siRNA plasmid on expression of FLAG epitope-tagged KLF4 in cultured SMC co-transfected with our FLAG epitope-tagged KLF4 expression plasmid. Results showed that expression of FLAG-KLF4 was significantly (although not completely) inhibited by pM-KLF4 as compared with multiple control siRNAs, including an empty vector (pMighty) or pM-Scramble (Fig. 4a). Significantly, PDGF-BB-induced repression of SM α-actin was partially abrogated by transfection with the KLF4 siRNA plasmid (Fig. 4b), suggesting that KLF4 was at least one effector of PDGF-BB-induced transcriptional repression in cultured SMCs. Similar results were obtained with several independent siRNA-targeting constructs, whereas no effect was seen with the scrambled siRNA or with an siRNA targeting EGFP. PDGF-BB Treatment or Overexpression of KLF4 Virtually Abrogated SRF Binding to the CArG Region of SM α-Actin— Because the MADS domain of SRF was reported to be necessary for DNA binding (28Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that KLF4-induced repression might be the result of the inhibition of SRF binding to CArG elements. Significantly, although KLF4 had no effect on SRF binding in in vitro gel shift assays (data not shown), results of quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that KLF4 overexpression, as well as PDGF-BB treatment, of cultured SMC were associated with marked reductions in SRF binding to CArG-containing regions of the SM α-actin promoter within intact chromatin (Fig. 5, a and b). Importantly, these effects were selective in that SRF binding to the c-fos CArG was unchanged by KLF4 and increased by PDGF-BB. Consistent with these results, our previous transfection studies (18Dandre F. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H2042-H2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showed that PDGF-BB treatment was associated with repression of the SM α-actin promoter but activation of the c-fos promoter, whereas KLF4 significantly repressed expression of the SM α-actin promoter (Fig. 5c).

https://openalex.org/W2162484161,"In the developing spinal cord, early progenitor cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage are induced in the motor neuron progenitor (pMN) domain of the ventral neuroepithelium by the ventral midline signal Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The ventral generation of oligodendrocytes requires Nkx6-regulated expression of the bHLH gene Olig2 in this domain. In the absence of Nkx6 genes or Shh signaling, the initial expression of Olig2 in the pMN domain is completely abolished. In this study, we provide the in vivo evidence for a late phase of Olig gene expression independent of Nkx6 and Shh gene activities and reveal a brief second wave of oligodendrogenesis in the dorsal spinal cord. In addition, we provide genetic evidence that oligodendrogenesis can occur in the absence of hedgehog receptor Smoothened, which is essential for all hedgehog signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2171269012,"Gamma frequency network oscillations are assumed to be important in cognitive processes, including hippocampal memory operations, but the precise functions of these oscillations remain unknown. Here, we examine the cellular and network mechanisms underlying carbachol-induced fast network oscillations in the hippocampus in vitro, which closely resemble hippocampal gamma oscillations in the behaving rat. Using a combination of planar multielectrode array recordings, imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes, and recordings from single hippocampal neurons within the CA3 gamma generator, active current sinks and sources were localized to the stratum pyramidale. These proximal currents were driven by phase-locked rhythmic inhibitory inputs to pyramidal cells from identified perisomatic-targeting interneurons. AMPA receptor-mediated recurrent excitation was necessary for the synchronization of interneuronal discharge, which strongly supports a synaptic feedback model for the generation of hippocampal gamma oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1990474842,"Studies have indicated that oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord originate from a ventral progenitor domain defined by expression of the oligodendrocyte-determining bHLH proteins Olig1 and Olig2. Here, we provide evidence that progenitors in the dorsal spinal cord and hindbrain also produce oligodendrocytes and that the specification of these cells may result from a dorsal evasion of BMP signaling over time. Moreover, we show that the generation of ventral oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord depends on Nkx6.1 and Nkx6.2 function, while these homeodomain proteins in the anterior hindbrain instead suppress oligodendrocyte specification. The opposing roles for Nkx6 proteins in the spinal cord and hindbrain, in turn, appear to reflect that oligodendrocytes are produced by distinct ventral progenitor domains at these axial levels. Based on these findings, we propose that oligodendrocytes derive from several distinct positional origins and that the activation of Olig1/2 at different positions is controlled by distinct genetic programs."
https://openalex.org/W2024805424,"The transcriptional activation by SRY-type high mobility group box 9 (SOX9) and the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signals are necessary for chondrogenic differentiation. We have previously shown that CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300) act as an important SOX9 co-activator during chondrogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between TGF-β-dependent Smad2/3 signaling pathways and the SOX9-CBP/p300 transcriptional complex at the early stage of chondrogenesis. Overexpressed Smad3 strongly induced the primary chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, Smad3 enhanced the transcriptional activity of SOX9 and the expression of α1(II) collagen gene (COL2A1), and small interference RNA against Smad3 (si-Smad3) inhibited them. We observed that Smad2/3 associated with Sox9 in a TGF-β-dependent manner and formed the transcriptional complexes with SOX9 on the enhancer region of COL2A1. Interestingly, the association between Sox9 and CBP/p300 was increased by Smad3 overexpression and was suppressed by si-Smad3. Our findings indicate that Smad3 has a stronger potential to stimulate the SOX9-dependent transcriptional activity by modulating the interaction between SOX9 and CBP/p300, rather than Smad2. This study suggests that the Smad3 pathway presents a key role for the SOX9-dependent transcriptional activation in primary chondrogenesis.

In cellular differentiation, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis are modulated by bone morphogenetic proteins, which are members of the TGF-β superfamily (4Hogan B.L.

Bone morphogenetic proteins stimulate osteoblastic differentiation through the enhancement of runt-related gene 2 (Runx2)-based transcriptional activity. Bone morphogenetic protein-regulated Smads (Smad1/5/8) have been reported to progress osteogenesis by associating with Runx2, which is a key transcription factor in bone formation (7Zhang Y.W. Yasui N. Ito K. Huang G. Fujii M. Hanai J. Nogami H. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10549-10554Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, the effects of TGF-β during chondrogenesis are still unclear. The differentiation of chondrocytes is regulated by the conflictive effects of TGF-β. TGF-β promotes the differentiation of embryonic chick limb cartilage (8Kulyk W.M. Rodgers B.J. Greer K. Kosher R.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Primary chondrogenesis derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) needs TGF-β signals (9Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18029) Google Scholar). Conversely, TGF-β inhibits chondrocyte maturation (10Ballock R.T. Heydemann A. Wakefield L.M. Flanders K.C.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4728-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These reports have prompted us to investigate an unknown regulatory mechanism of TGF-β in chondrogenesis. Several pathways after the activation of TGF-β receptor, such as Smad2/3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), have been identified as key signaling processes in response to TGF-β treatments (2Liu F.

However, the mechanism of each TGF-β signaling process in primary chondrogenesis has not been fully clarified. We focus here on the function of TGF-β-regulated Smads (Smad2/3) during chondrogenesis derived from human MSCs. Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) and then form the heteromeric complexes by associating with Smad4 (14Massague ́ J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). These Smad complexes move into the nucleus and regulate expression of their target genes through the direct binding to Smad-binding element on DNA sequence (16Dennler S. Itoh S.

Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). DNA-binding activity, which is lacking in Smad2, is dependent on the β hairpin in Mad homology 1 (MH1) domains of Smad3 and Smad4 (18Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague ́ J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). MH2 domain of Smad3 has been reported to associate with many transcription factors such as Runx2 and MyoD acting as a critical transcription factor for myogenesis (19Alliston T. Choy L. Ducy P.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition, MH2 domains of Smad2 and Smad3 interact with a co-activator termed cAMP-response element-binding protein binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300, which has histone acetyltransferase activity (21Nishihara A.

Therefore, we investigated the interactions between Smad2/3 and other molecules that induce chondrogenesis. SOX9 (SRY-type high mobility group box 9), which encodes a high mobility group DNA-binding domain, has been identified as a master transcription factor in chondrocyte differentiation (23Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The expression of α1 chain of type II collagen (Col2a1), the major component of cartilage extracellular matrix, closely parallels that of Sox9 (24Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Col2a1 expression is regulated by Sox9 through the association with SOX9-binding site on the Col2a1 enhancer region (25Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). However, the SOX9-dependent regulation during chondrogenesis seems to require additional cofactors (26Tan L. Peng H. Osaki M. Choy B.K. Auron P.E. Sandell L.J. Goldring M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17688-17700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We described previously that CBP/p300 is an important co-activator for enhancing the transcriptional activity of Sox9 (27Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study, we further analyzed the cross-talk among SOX9, CBP/p300, and Smad2/3 during chondrogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that Smad3 stimulates primary chondrogenesis and modulates the association between Sox9 and p300. Moreover, the SOX9-dependent transcription is regulated by the transcriptional complex consisting of Smad3, SOX9, and CBP/p300. Cells and Cell Culture—Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were obtained from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and maintained with mesenchymal stem cell growth media. According to the chondrogenesis protocol, 5 × 105 cells were precipitated and cultured in TGF-β3 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) containing chondrogenic induction media (Cambrex) for 1 week. MSCs between passages 3 and 5 were used. A human chondrosarcoma cell line (SW1353) was used as an immature chondrogenic cell line (27Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol.

RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA samples (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed to cDNA as described previously (28Furumatsu T. Nishida K. Kawai A. Namba M. Inoue H. Ninomiya Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were subjected to PCR amplification in the presence of the following specific primer sets: 5′-TGG GCA AGC TCT GGA GAC-3′ and 5′-CCC TCT CGC TTC AGG TCA-3′ for SOX9, 5′-ACA CCG TGG CTT CAC TGG TC-3′ and 5′-TGG GTT TGC AAC GGA TTG T-3′ for COL2A1, 5′-GGG TCG TCC ATC TTG CCA TTC AC-3′ and 5′-TTA TGA CAT GCT TGA GCA AC-3′ for Smad2, and 5′-GGG TCG TCC ATC CTG CCT TTC AC-3′ and 5′-CTA AGA CAC ACT GGA ACA GC-3′ for Smad3. PCR fragments were normalized with the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signals (5′-ATC AGC AAT GCC TCC TGC AC-3′ and 5′-CGT CAA AGG TGG AGG AGT GG-3′). PCR reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 cycles.

For the silencing of Smad2 and Smad3 expression, SMARTpool Smad2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc, Lake Placid, NY), and the duplex targeting sequences against Smad3 (5′-CGU CAA CAC CAA GUG CAU CTT-3′ and 5′-GAU GCA CUU GGU GUU GAC GTT-3′) were used as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. The duplex sequence against green fluorescent protein was used as a control siRNA. Adenovirus Infection and Transfection—Cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses of FLAG-Smad2/3/7 (gifts from T. Imamura and K. Miyazono) for 48 h as described before (31Fujii M. Takeda K.

The siRNA against Smad2 (si-Smad2) and si-Smad3 (200 nm) were transiently transfected into cultured cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), 12 h before the following procedures. Suspended MSCs were treated with adenoviral Smads for 30 min at a multiplicity of infection of 10 before the pellet culture procedures. SW1353 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE6 reagents (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured for 48 h before immunoprecipitation assays. Indicated plasmids (500 ng) were used for transfection analyses. Subcellular Fractionation—After 30-min treatments with TGF-β3 (5 ng/ml), MSCs were scraped with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in five pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. Supernatants were retained as the cytoplasmic fractions. Precipitated nuclei were lysed in 2.5 pellet volumes of buffer B (420 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice (32Hayes S.A. Huang X. Kambhampati S. Platanias L.C. Bergan R.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4450-4841Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Attached MSCs on CultureSlide (BD Biosciences) were fixed with cold acetone for 10 min at -20 °C. Pellet-cultured cells, maintained for 1 week, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-buffered solution and embedded in paraffin. The following procedures for safranin O staining were performed as described previously (28Furumatsu T. Nishida K. Kawai A. Namba M. Inoue H. Ninomiya Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analyses using anti-Smad2/3 antibodies (Upstate) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals were visualized using Vectastain ABC-AP kit and Vector red alkaline phosphatase substrate kit, and then the sections were stained with Vector hematoxylin QS (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for counterstaining. Rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a control. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation, cells were scraped with immunoprecipitation buffer 0 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors) after indicated treatments. Cell extracts were then sonicated and centrifuged. Ten percent volume of supernatant was loaded as an input fraction. Remaining supernatants were incubated with protein G beads (Sigma) containing 1 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or HA affinity matrix (Covance, Berkeley, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Western blotting were performed using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion), anti-Smad2/3, anti-Phospho-Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-SOX9 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) antibodies as described previously (33Asahara H.

Luciferase Reporter Assay—pKN185 Luc (kind gift from Yoshihiko Yamada, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used as a reporter gene for investigating the activity of mouse Col2a1 promoter and enhancer (34Tanaka K. Matsumoto Y. Nakatani F. Iwamoto Y. Yamada Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4428-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To assess the SOX9-dependent transcriptional activity, Gal4-TK Luc reporter and Gal4-Sox9 construct were transfected. Appropriate plasmids (20 ng, except for 50 ng of CBP/p300) were cotransfected into SW1353 cells using FuGENE6. pRL-SV40 (1 ng, Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control. siRNA treatments were performed for 12 h prior to the transfection of reporter plasmids. The transiently transfected cells were harvested for 24 h, and then the luciferase activities were analyzed using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The assays were performed in triplicate. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using 2 × 106 cells on 6-cm dishes for each sample. SW1353 cells were infected with indicated adenoviral Smads for 48 h. Cells were fixed by formaldehyde and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After 5-min incubation using 0.125 m glycine, the cells were washed and scraped with phosphate-buffered saline. Precipitated cells were suspended in cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were sonicated with 20-s bursts. Supernatants were diluted in equal amount of immunoprecipitation buffer 0. The 10% volume of each sample was stocked as an input sample. Half of each sample was incubated with 4 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels, or 4 μl of protein G beads containing 1 μg of mouse IgG (Sigma) as a control, for 3 h at 4 °C. Pelleted beads were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer 0, and suspended in elution buffer 1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) for 15 min at 65 °C. Supernatants were stocked. Beads were resuspended in elution buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.67% SDS) for 15 min at 65 °C. The supernatants were combined with stocked supernatants. Samples were incubated for 4 h at 65 °C and treated with proteinase K (Invitrogen) overnight at 37 °C. DNA samples were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The following primers were used to amplify the enhancer region, which contains the SOX9-binding site, of COL2A1 gene: 5′-TTC CAG ATG GGG CTG AAA C-3′ and 5′-ATT GTG GGA GAG GGG GTC T-3′. The COL2A1 promoter region, which includes a putative SRY-binding consensus sequence, was amplified by the following primers: 5′-TGT CTT TTC CGT CCT TGG TC-3′ and 5′-CTC TGA CCA CAG GCG GGA AG-3′. TGF-β Induces Chondrogenesis and the Nuclear Translocation of Smad2/3 in Human MSCs—TGF-β plays a key role to induce chondrogenic differentiation in pellet-cultured cells derived from human MSCs (9Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18029) Google Scholar). In this three-dimension culture, TGF-β treatments stimulated the expression of α1 chain of type II collagen gene (COL2A1), which is the main chondrogenic differentiation marker. The expression level of the master transcription factor for chondrogenesis, SOX9, was also increased by TGF-β in pellet-cultured cells (Fig. 1A). However, COL2A1 and SOX9 expressions were not increased in monolayer-cultured cells (Fig. 1A). The expression of Smad2 and Smad3, which are the main transducers of TGF-β signal, showed no significant differences along with chondrogenesis (data not shown). These results indicated that both TGF-β signal and the three-dimension culture were necessary for the early chondrogenic differentiation. To assess TGF-β effects on the initiation of chondrogenesis via Smad pathway, we analyzed the localization of Smad2 and Smad3 in MSCs. TGF-β treatments stimulated the nuclear translocation of endogenous Smad2/3 even in MSCs (Fig. 1B). In addition, we detected phosphorylated Smad2/3 in the nuclear fraction after TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 1C). These data prompted us to investigate the functions of Smad2/3 during chondrogenesis. Smad3 Accelerates the Early Chondrogenic Differentiation—Here, we focused on Smad signaling pathway activated by TGF-β during chondrogenesis. To examine the effects of Smad2/3, we infected these Smads into pellet-cultured MSCs using adenovirus overexpression systems. Smad3 strongly stimulated the syntheses of proteoglycans in pellet-cultured cells (Fig. 2A, safranin O). Smad3 also increased the expression of COL2A1 mRNA (Fig. 2B). However, the SOX9 expression did not change in Smad3-overexpressed cells (Fig. 2B). Smad2-overexpressed cells showed no significant differences in both safranin O staining and COL2A1 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Simultaneously, we analyzed the knock-down models of Smad2/3 using their siRNAs. si-Smad3 inhibited MSC-derived chondrogenesis in safranin O staining (Fig. 2C) and reduced the expression of COL2A1 in reverse transcription-PCR analyses (Fig. 2E). However, si-Smad2 did not show remarkable inhibitory effects in our chondrogenic induction models. These observations suggest that Smad3 might have a stronger potential to induce the early chondrogenesis as the TGF-β signal transducer, rather than Smad2. Smad3 Up-regulates the Col2a1 Transcription and the Sox9-dependent Transcriptional Activity—We hypothesized that Smad3 might progress chondrogenesis through modulating the function of SOX9, which is the key transcription factor for COL2A1 expression. To investigate Smad functions in an early stage of chondrogenesis, we used SW1353 cells as immature chondrogenic cells. Interestingly, SOX9 was co-immunoprecipitated with Smad2/3 in a TGF-β-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In addition, the associations between transfected Smad2/3 and endogenous SOX9 were increased by TGF-β treatments (Fig. 3B). To assess the effects of Smad2/3 on the SOX9-dependent transcriptional activity, we performed luciferase assays using pKN185, which includes a native Col2a1 promoter and enhancer, and Gal4-Sox9 systems. Transfected Smad3 increased the luciferase activity based on endogenous SOX9 in pKN185-transfected SW1353 cells (Fig. 3D). We also observed the transcriptional up-regulation of Gal4 reporter gene based on transfected Gal4-Sox9 by the co-transfection with Smad3 (Fig. 3E, Gal4-Sox9 182-507). These effects of Smad3 were higher than that of Smad2. In addition, TβR-I(TD) mainly enhanced the levels of reporter activities in Smad3-transfected cells (Fig. 3, D and E). We also performed the co-transfection of Smad7, which is the main inhibitor of Smad2/3 phosphorylation and their nuclear localization (35Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 36Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y.

Smad7 inhibited the positive effects of Smad2/3 and TβR-I(TD), especially in pKN185 systems (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that the nuclear-translocated Smad3 might have an important role to stimulate the SOX9-regulated COL2A1 expression. Smad2/3 Associate with SOX9 on the COL2A1 Enhancer—To confirm the binding region of SOX9 against Smad2/3, we performed co-transfection analyses using SW1353 cells. HA-Smad2/3 similarly combined with the full-length of FLAG-Sox9 (Fig. 4B, 1-507). However, we observed the differences in the association between four kinds of deletion mutant (DM) of FLAG-Sox9 and HA-Smads. The Sox9 DM, which lacks 328-423 amino acids, did not show significant affinities against Smad2/3 (Fig. 4B, Δ328-423). In luciferase assays, the activity of Gal4-Sox9 Δ328-423, which lacks a putative Smad2/3-binding domain, showed no significant increase by the co-transfection of TβR-I(TD) and Smad2/3 (Fig. 4C). To estimate whether the SOX9-Smad2/3 complex acts as a transcriptional device on COL2A1 gene, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. DNA fragments, which include the SOX9-binding site (-CATTCAT-) on the intron 1 of COL2A1, were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-adenoviral Smad2/3, and were amplified by PCR analyses (Fig. 4D, Enhancer). However, the COL2A1 promoter fragment, which contains a putative SRY-binding sequence (-AAACACC-), was not detected (Fig. 4D, Promoter). These findings suggest that the domain corresponding to 328-423 amino acids of Sox9 is necessary for the associations with Smad2/3 and that Smad2/3 modulate the COL2A1 expression by forming the SOX9-Smad2/3 complex on the COL2A1 enhancer region. Smad3 and CBP/p300 Synergistically Activate the Sox9-dependent Transcription by Associating with Sox9 —We described previously that CBP/p300 modulates the function of Sox9 as a co-activator (27Tsuda M. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Asahara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We further analyzed the relationships among Smad2/3, SOX9, and CBP/p300. Overexpressed Sox9 was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MH2 domains of Smad2/3 (Fig. 5B). HA-p300 also associated with Smad2/3 and their MH2 domains (Fig. 5C). However, MH1 domains of Smad2/3 showed no affinities against Sox9 and p300 (Fig. 5, B and C). Surprisingly, co-transfected Smad2/3 slightly increased the association between Sox9 and p300 (Fig. 5D, left panel), and si-Smad3 suppressed the Sox9-p300 interaction (Fig. 5D, right panel). In luciferase assays, Smad3 and CBP/p300 synergistically increased the activities of pKN185 and Gal4-Sox9 systems (Fig. 5E). In addition, si-Smad3 strongly inhibited the Sox9-CBP/p300-dependent transcriptional activities (Fig. 5F). These results suggest that Smad3 might have a stronger potential to regulate the SOX9-dependent transcription through modifying the association between SOX9 and CBP/p300 in a TGF-β-dependent manner, rather than Smad2. SOX9, a high mobility group domain-containing transcription factor, is known to play an essential role in establishing the pre-cartilaginous condensations and initiating chondroblast differentiation (37de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. Bi W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1967271803,"The activity-dependent removal of AMPA receptors from synapses underlies long-term depression in hippocampal excitatory synapses. In this study, we have investigated the role of the small GTPase Rab5 during this process. We propose that Rab5 is a critical link between the signaling cascades triggered by LTD induction and the machinery that executes the activity-dependent removal of AMPA receptors. We have found that Rab5 activation drives the specific internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors in a clathrin-dependent manner and that this activity is required for LTD. Interestingly, Rab5 does not participate in the constitutive cycling of AMPA receptors. Rab5 is able to remove both GluR1 and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits, leading to GluR1 dephosphorylation. Importantly, NMDA receptor-dependent LTD induction produces a rapid and transient increase of active (GTP bound) Rab5. We propose a model in which synaptic activity leads to Rab5 activation, which in turn drives the removal of AMPA receptors from synapses."

Xylose is one of the major components of hemicellulose, the second most abundant carbohydrate polymer in nature. Efficient utilization of xylose is required to develop economically viable processes for producing biofuels such as ethanol from biomass (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Ingram L.O. Gomez P.F. Lai X.

Yeasts have long been used for the production of alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer, and Japanese sake. In particular, Saccharomyces cerevisiaehas been used widely because of the ability to produce high concentrations of ethanol and high inherent ethanol tolerance. The native strains, however, cannot ferment xylose as a carbon source. The major strategy for the generation of xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiaeis to introduce genes involved in xylose metabolism from other organisms (Scheme 1). In xylose-fermenting fungi such as Pichia stipitis, xylose is converted into xylulose by the sequential action of two oxidoreductases. First, xylose reductase (alditol:NADP+1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.21) catalyzes reduction of the C1 carbonyl group of xylose, yielding xylitol as the product. Xylitol is then oxidized by xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH 1The abbreviations used are: XDH, xylitol dehydrogenase; PsXDH, XDH from P. stipitis; MDR, medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; PDH, polyol dehydrogenase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; SDH, sorbitol dehydrogenase; WT, wild-type enzyme; AR, D207A/I208R mutant; AiS, D207A/F209S mutant; RS, I208R/F209S mutant; ARS, D207A/I208R/F209S mutant; ART, D207A/I208R/F209T mutant; ARY, D207A/I208R/F209Y mutant; ARSdR, D207A/I208R/F209S/N211R mutant; C4, S96C/S99C/Y102C mutant; C4/ARS, mutant containing C4 and ARS mutations; C4/ARSdR, mutant containing C4 and ARSdR mutations; CD, circular dichroism; Tm, thermal unfolding transition temperature; M. morganii, Morganella morganii; S. pombe, Schizosaccharomyces pombe; E. japonica; Eriobotrya japonica; H. jecorina, Hypocrea jecorina.1The abbreviations used are: XDH, xylitol dehydrogenase; PsXDH, XDH from P. stipitis; MDR, medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; PDH, polyol dehydrogenase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; SDH, sorbitol dehydrogenase; WT, wild-type enzyme; AR, D207A/I208R mutant; AiS, D207A/F209S mutant; RS, I208R/F209S mutant; ARS, D207A/I208R/F209S mutant; ART, D207A/I208R/F209T mutant; ARY, D207A/I208R/F209Y mutant; ARSdR, D207A/I208R/F209S/N211R mutant; C4, S96C/S99C/Y102C mutant; C4/ARS, mutant containing C4 and ARS mutations; C4/ARSdR, mutant containing C4 and ARSdR mutations; CD, circular dichroism; Tm, thermal unfolding transition temperature; M. morganii, Morganella morganii; S. pombe, Schizosaccharomyces pombe; E. japonica; Eriobotrya japonica; H. jecorina, Hypocrea jecorina.; EC 1.1.1.9) to give xylulose. S. cerevisiaetransformed with these two genes from P. stipitiscould ferment xylose to ethanol. There is another problem; the excretion of xylitol occurs unless a co-metabolizable carbon source such as glucose is added. This is probably caused by several combined factors. In particular, intercellular redox imbalance due to a different coenzyme specificity of xylose reductase (with NADPH) and XDH (with NAD+) has been thought to be one of the main factors (2Ostergaard S. Olsson L. Nielsen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 34-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The generation of an NADP+-dependent XDH by protein engineering would avoid this problem. XDH is a medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR), which constitutes a large enzyme superfamily consisting of about 1000 members (for reviews, see Refs. 5Nordling E. Jornvall H. Persson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4267-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholarand 6Riveros-Rosas H. Julian-Sanchez A. Villalobos-Molina R. Pardo J.P. Pina E. Eur. J.

The superfamily is classified into eight subfamilies based on amino acid sequence alignment and the structural similarity of substrates. XDH belongs to the polyol dehydrogenase (PDH) subfamily that contains sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH; EC 1.1.1.14) and l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase from several organisms. Most PDHs catalyze strict NAD+(H)-dependent interconversion between alcohols and their corresponding ketones or aldehydes. The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) subfamily, whose enzymes have been studied most extensively, are either NAD+(H)- or NADP+(H)-dependent enzymes.

Some possess an additional second zinc atom, which is known as a structural zinc atom (see Fig. 1). Although the role of the structural zinc atom has been proposed to maintain the quaternary structure of the protein, its role has not yet been clarified (16Eklund H. Horjales E. Jörnvall H.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11604-11614Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and “landmark” amino acid residues have already been proposed for the discrimination between NAD+(H) and NADP+(H) (39Baker P.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Rob A. Stillman T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Generally, subunit structures in the MDR superfamily are composed of two domains, namely a coenzyme binding domain within the intermediate segment and a catalytic domain consisting of N- and C-terminal segments (Fig. 1). The coenzyme binding domains possess a similar β-α-β motif centered around a highly conserved Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly sequence (where Xis any amino acid) that constitutes a tight turn at the end of the first β-strand and marks the beginning of the succeeding α-helix (Table I). The ability of dehydrogenases to discriminate between NAD+and NADP+lies in the amino acid sequence of this β-α-β motif. The primary determinant of NAD+specificity is the presence of an aspartate residue, which forms doublehydrogen bonds to both the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups in the ribosyl moiety of NAD+and induces negative electrostatic potential to the binding site. Commonly, this residue in NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases is replaced by a smaller and uncharged residue such as Gly, Ala, and Ser, accompanied by the concurrent presence of an arginine residue that forms a positive binding pocket for the 2′-phosphate group of NADP+. Despite the prevalence of this information, the full reversal of coenzyme specificity, in terms of having a mutant enzyme catalytically efficient as the wild type, has rarely been achieved. Bemisia argentifolii(whitefly) SDH is the only enzyme showing a strict preference to NADP+(H) among all characterized PDHs (14Banfield M.J. Salvucci M.E. Baker E.N. Smith C.A. J. Mol.

In this study we used NAD+-dependent XDH from P. stipitis(PsXDH) as a target protein (41Rizzi M. Harwart K. Erlemann P. Bui-Thanh N.A. Dellweg H. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1989; 67: 20-24Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 42Kotter P. Amore R. Hollenberg C.P. Ciriacy M. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and completely reversed the coenzyme specificity to generate a novel NADP+-dependent XDH mutant by multiple site-directed mutagenesis. Because the mutations produced decreased thermostability compared with the wild-type enzyme, we focused on a structural zinc atom that is not contained in native PsXDH (see Fig. 1). Introduction of specific cysteine ligands into the enzyme gave an additional zinc-binding site and improved thermostability. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of NADP+-dependent PsXDH was also improved by the introduction of an additional zinc atom. Cloning of the PsXDH Gene—P. stipitis(Yamadazyma stipitisNBRC 1687) was purchased from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (Chiba, Japan) and cultured at 25 °C in YM medium (10 g of glucose, 5 g of peptone, 3 g of yeast extract, and 3 g of malt extract per liter (pH 5.6)). The isolation of P. stipitisgenomic DNA was carried out according to the methods of Kotter et al.(42Kotter P. Amore R. Hollenberg C.P. Ciriacy M. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Based on the published sequence of the P. stipitis Xyl2gene (GenBank™ accession number X55392), the following two primers were designed: Xyl2UP, 5′-ATGACTGCTAACCCTTCCTTGGTGTTG-3′ (27-mer) and Xyl2DOWN, 5′-TTACTCAGGGCCGTCAATGAGACACTTG-3′ (28-mer). PCR was carried out using PCR Thermal Cycler PERSONAL (TaKaRa) in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 10 pmol of primers, 1 unit of KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo), and 100 ng of P. stipitisgenomic DNA under conditions of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1.5 min. A single PCR product was introduced into the SmaI site in the plasmid pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene) to yield pBSXyl2. To introduce the restriction site for BamHI and PstI at 5′ and 3′ termini of the Xyl2, respectively, PCR was carried out using pBSXyl2as a template DNA and the following two primers: XDHBamHI, 5′-catacggatccgACTGCTAACCCTTCCTTGG-3′ (32-mer), and XDHPstI, 5′-cttggctgcagTTACTCAGGGCCGTCAATGAGACAC-3′ (36-mer) (lowercase letters indicate additional bases for introducing digestion sites of BamHI and PstI (underlined letters)). The amplified DNA fragment was introduced into BamHI-PstI sites in pQE-81L (Qiagen), a plasmid vector for conferring N-terminal His6tag on the expressed proteins, to obtain pHisWT. Amino Acid Sequence Alignment of PsXDH—The protein sequence of PsXDH was analyzed using the Protein BLAST program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and only proteins that possessed highly significant similarity and had already been characterized were used for multiple-sequence alignment using the ClustalW program distributed by the Bioinformatics Center of Kyoto University (www.genome.jp). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutations were introduced by sequential steps of PCR (43Penning T.M. Jez J.M. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3027-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with a small modification. The synthetic oligonucleotide primer sequences involving the mutations are shown in Table II. In the first round, two reactions, I and II, were performed with the following primers, XDHBamHIand one of the antisense primers containing the mutations (reaction I) and one of the sense primers containing the mutations and XDHPstI(reaction II). In the final amplification step purified overlapping PCR products were used as templates, and XDHBamHIand XDHPstIwere used as primers. D207A, I208R, F209S, N211R, and C4 (S96C/S99C/Y102C) mutants were obtained using pHisWTas a template. All the final PCR products were cloned into pQE-81L to obtain plasmids pHisD207A, pHisI208R, pHisF209S, pHisN211R, and pHisC4, respectively.Table IIConstruction of mutant PsXDHa Dots indicate the same amino acid residues as PsXDH.

Open table in a new tab a Dots indicate the same amino acid residues as PsXDH. Gray-shadowed letters show the mutated amino acid residues of PsXDH in this study. b Only sense primers are shown.

XDH double mutants AR (D207A/I208R), AiS (D207A/F209S), and RS (I208R/F209S) were constructed using pHisD207Aor pHisI208Ras a template to obtain plasmids pHisAR, pHisAiS, and pHisRS, respectively. Furthermore, ARS mutant (D207A/I208R/F209S) was obtained using pHisAiSas a template (pHisARS). For ART (D207A/I208R/F209T), ARY (D207A/I208R/F209Y), and ARSdR (D207A/I208R/F209S/N211R) mutants, pHisARSwas used as a template to obtain plasmids of pHisART, pHisARY, and pHisARSdR, respectively. To construct C4/ARS (S96C/S99C/Y102C/D207A/I208R/F209S) and C4/ARSdR (S96C/S99C/Y102C/D207A/I208R/F209S/N211R) mutants, a single KpnI site in Xyl2DNA was used. Three plasmids of pHisARS, pHisARSdR, and pHisC4were digested with BamHI and KpnI. The smaller BamHI-KpnI fragments of pHisARSand pHisARSdR(∼400 bp) were exchanged for pHisC4to obtain pHisC4/ARSand pHisC4/ARSdR, respectively. The coding region of all mutated genes was confirmed by subsequent sequencing in both directions. Expression and Purification of His-tagged PsXDHs—Escherichia coliDH5α harboring the expression plasmid for the His-tagged wild-type enzyme (WT) and mutated PsXDHs was grown at 37 °C to a turbidity of 0.6 at 600 nm in Super broth medium (12 g of Tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of glycerol, 3.81 g of KH2PO4, and 12.5 g of K2HPO4per liter (pH 7.0)) containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. After the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was further grown for 6 h to induce the expression of PsXDH protein. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A (pH 8.0, 50 mmsodium phosphate containing 2 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mNaCl, 10 mmxylitol, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 10 mmimidazole) per liter of the culture. Hen-egg lysozyme was added to the cell suspension at concentrations of 2 mg/ml, and the mixture was gently shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were then disrupted by sonication for 4∼5 min with approximate intervals on ice using ASTRASON® Ultrasonic Liquid Processor XL2020 (Misonix Inc.). After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 24,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 6 h at 4 °C. All chromatography was carried out using an ÄKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was loaded onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer A. After washing with the same buffer, the column was further washed with Buffer B (pH 8.0, Buffer A containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mmimidazole instead of 10 mmimidazole). The enzymes were then eluted with Buffer C (pH 8.0, Buffer B containing 250 mmimidazole instead of 50 mmimidazole). The eluant was treated by ultrafiltration with Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore) at 4000 rpm for ∼2 h and dialyzed against Buffer D (pH 8.0, 50 mmsodium phosphate containing 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mmxylitol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 50% (w/v) glycerol). All His-tagged recombinant PsXDHs were stored at–35 °C until use. The native molecular mass of PsXDH was estimated by gel filtration, which was carried out using an ÄKTA purifier system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The purified enzyme was loaded onto an HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer E (pH 8.0, 50 mmsodium phosphate containing 2 mmMgCl2and 1 mmdithiothreitol) or water. Aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) in gel filtration calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular markers. Enzyme Assay—PsXDH activity was assayed routinely in the direction of polyol oxidation by measuring the reduction of NAD(P)+at 340 nm at 35 °C (41Rizzi M. Harwart K. Erlemann P. Bui-Thanh N.A. Dellweg H. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1989; 67: 20-24Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 50 mmMgCl2and 300 mmxylitol in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0) buffer. All reactions were started by the addition of 0.10 ml of a 20 mmNAD(P)+solution to a final volume of 1.0 ml (standard assay condition). One unit of enzyme activity refers to 1 μmol of NAD(P)+H produced/min. The kinetic parameters, Kmand kcatvalues, were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plot. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar) with 12% at 25 mA. For Western blot analysis the cell-free extracts of E. coliand/or purified PsXDHs were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins on the gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analysis was carried out with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and RGS·His HRP antibody, a horseradish peroxidase-fused mouse monoclonal antibody against Arg-Gly-Ser-His6in the N-terminal additive peptide of the expressed recombinant proteins (Qiagen). Metal Analysis—The zinc content of PsXDH was determined using an inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectrophotometer (ICAP-500, Nippon Jarrell-ASH Co., LTD, Kyoto, Japan). The protein sample was gel-filtered on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column with 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 8.0) and adjusted at concentrations of ∼0.5 mg/ml with the same buffer. A standard solution of Zn(NO3)2in 0.1 mHNO3was used for the calibration curve. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—For comparisons with the thermostability of the PsXDH, CD measurements at 220 nm were carried out between 10 and 70 °C with a Jasco spectropolarimeter model J-720 (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a quartz cuv"
https://openalex.org/W2138463362,"An enhanced endothelial formation of nitric oxide (NO) by red wine polyphenolic compounds (RWPs) has been involved in the protective effect of chronic intake of red wine on coronary diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) remains unclear. In the presence of indomethacin and charybdotoxin plus apamin to prevent the formation of prostanoids and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, respectively, RWPs caused pronounced endothelium-dependent relaxations in porcine coronary arteries. Relaxations to RWPs were abolished by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase) and the membrane permeant analog of superoxide dismutase (SOD), MnTMPyP, and reduced by polyethylene glycol-SOD (PEG-SOD), PEG-catalase and inhibitors of PI3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002). RWPs caused the L-NA-sensitive formation of NO, as assessed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy and the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in coronary artery endothelial cells; these responses were reduced by MnTMPyP, PEG-catalase, and inhibitors of PI3-kinase. RWPs caused the sustained phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS at Ser1177 in endothelial cells, which were abolished by MnTMPyP and inhibitors of PI3-kinase. These data demonstrate that RWPs induce the redox-sensitive activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway in endothelial cells which, in turn, causes phosphorylation of eNOS, resulting in an increased formation of NO."

Here, we report that HDAC7 is exported to the cytoplasm by a calcium-independent signaling pathway after TCR activation. Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) was activated after TCR engagement, interacted with HDAC7, and phosphorylated three serines (Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448) at its N terminus, leading to its export from the nucleus. Mutation of Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448 blocked the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7 in response to TCR activation, as did overexpression of a kinase-inactive form of PKD1. Consistent with the regulatory role of HDAC7 in Nur77 expression, PKD1 activation led to the transcriptional activation of Nur77 via myocyte enhancer factor 2-binding sites in its promoter. In a mouse model of negative selection, PKD1 was activated during thymocyte activation.

Histone acetylation and deacetylation are important in modifying chromatin structure and in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Mammalian histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1The abbreviations used are: HDACs, histone deacetylases; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; CaMK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase; TCR, T-cell receptor; DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; PKD, protein kinase D; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HA, hemagglutinin; CsA, cyclosporin A. are divided into three classes based on their homology to yeast proteins. Class I HDACs are homologous to Rpd3; class II HDACs are related to Hda1; and class III HDACs are homologous to Sir2. Class II HDACs are further subdivided into class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 and the HDAC9 splice variant MITR) and class IIb (HDAC6 and HDAC10) (reviewed in Ref. 1.Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The class IIa HDACs possess a conserved C-terminal catalytic HDAC domain and interact with myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors through an N-terminal 17-amino acid motif. This interaction leads to the recruitment of class IIa HDACs to select promoters, where MEF2 is bound, resulting in the repression of its transcriptional activity. The repressive activity of class IIa HDACs is tightly regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and by their phosphorylation-dependent association with the intracellular 14-3-3 proteins (2.Dressel U.

Phosphorylation of conserved residues in the N-terminal regions of HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 in response to cellular signals leads to interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, dissociation of the class IIa HDAC·MEF2 complexes, and a conformational change culminating in export from the nucleus (6.McKinsey T.A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6312-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Given the central role of phosphorylation in the regulation of class IIa HDAC activity, there is considerable interest in the identification of the responsible kinase(s). It has been reported that the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) phosphorylates HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC9, leading to their export from the nucleus and to gene activation in skeletal and cardiac myocytes (6.McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 7.McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell.

A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, the endogenous HDAC kinase activity in cardiac myocytes is resistant to pharmacological inhibitors of CaMK, suggesting that other kinases may be responsible for HDAC phosphorylation (12.Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). We recently reported that HDAC7 is expressed at high levels in thymocytes during the CD4+ CD8+ double-positive stage (14.Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In resting thymocytes, HDAC7 is localized in the cell nucleus and represses the expression of the orphan steroid nuclear receptor Nur77 by interacting with the transcription factor MEF2D, which binds constitutively to the nur77 promoter (13.Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14.Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). nur77, an immediate-early gene, is up-regulated in response to T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and has been implicated in the negative selection (apoptosis) of T cells (15.Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 16.Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). After TCR activation, HDAC7 is exported to the cytoplasm, leading to the derepression of the nur77 promoter and the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, mutation of three serine residues at the N terminus of HDAC7 inhibits its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in response to TCR activation and also suppresses TCR-induced apoptosis (14.Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that an intracellular signaling pathway, originating at the TCR, is involved in the phosphorylation and subcellular localization of HDAC7 in thymocytes and that this signal controls the apoptosis of thymocytes in response to TCR activation. T cells use a complex array of signal transduction pathways to control their proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. TCR engagement leads to the activation of phospholipase Cγ1, which in turn initiates the activation of two well characterized major signaling pathways. Phospholipase Cγ1 induces the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol in the plasma membrane, producing inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol polyphosphates increase intracellular calcium levels by binding to specific receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the activation of the calcineurin/NF-AT cascade. Diacylglycerol (DAG) induces a calcium-independent signal transduction pathway, which comprises the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase D (PKD) signaling modules (reviewed in Ref. 17.Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PKD1, also called PKCμ, is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to a new family of protein kinases with two other members, PKD2 and PKD3/PKCν. PKD1, the main isoform expressed in T cells (18.Marklund U. Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is mainly activated by a phospholipase C-DAG-PKC signal transduction pathway (reviewed in Ref. 19.Rykx A. De Kimpe L. Mikhalap S. Vantus T. Seufferlein T. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). PKD1 activation is mediated by the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 in the activation loop of its catalytic domain (20.Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21.Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Lightfoot K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22.Matthews S.A. Dayalu R. Thompson L.J. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the specific substrates for PKD and its exact function in lymphocytes remain unclear. Here, we show that a calcium-independent signaling pathway is responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7 in a thymocyte hybridoma cell line (DO11.10) after TCR activation. Moreover, PKD1, which is activated after TCR engagement, interacts with and phosphorylates HDAC7, leading to its nuclear export and to the activation of Nur77 transcription. Finally, we show that PKD1 is activated by TCR activation in vivo in a mouse model of negative selection. Plasmids—The pcDNA3.1-based expression vector for FLAG-tagged human HDAC7 has been described (25.Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Fillion M. Hendzel M.J. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35826-35835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions were constructed in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Deletion constructs of HDAC7 were generated by PCR and the cloning procedures described previously (25.Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Fillion M. Hendzel M.J. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35826-35835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the N or C terminus of HDAC7 have been described (25.Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Fillion M.

The luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the nur77 promoter (pNur77-Luc) was generated by cloning the –3800 to +87 genomic sequences of the nur77 promoter (a kind gift from Astar Winoto, University of California, Berkeley, CA) (13.Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) into pGL2-Basic (Promega). Minimal wild-type and mutant MEF2 reporter constructs (pMEF2wt-Luc and pMEF2mt-Luc) were as described (13.Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). PKD1 expression vectors were provided by Dr. Alex Toker (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Assay—DO11.10 T-cell hybridomas and 293T cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml streptomycin/penicillin. DO11.10 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method. The DNA concentration was kept constant in different samples by using the corresponding empty vector. In some cases, cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (0.5 μm) for 4 h, beginning 36 h after transfection, and harvested for reporter assays. All transfections represent the result of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Luciferase reporter assays were performed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using an elongation factor 1α promoter-driven Renilla luciferase expression vector as an internal control. 293T cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. For anti-CD3/CD28 antibody stimulation, monoclonal antibodies 500A2 and 37.51 were bound to the culture flask by incubating a 1:2000 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, followed by three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitation—Total cellular extracts from DO11.10 cells or primary thymocytes were prepared in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Total cell lysates from transiently transfected 293T cells were prepared in IPLS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors (26.Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C. For FLAG-tagged proteins, antibody M2-agarose (Sigma) was used at 15 μl/ml. Immunoprecipitated material was washed three times with IPLS buffer (26.Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous PKD1, anti-PKD1 antiserum was used at 2 μg/ml in combination with a 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated PKD1 was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm orthovanadate and once with PKD1 kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Bound proteins were subjected to either SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis or protein kinase assays. Protein Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitated PKD1 was incubated with myelin basic protein or purified GST-HDAC7 fusion proteins. Phosphorylation reactions were performed in 30 μl of PKD1 kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. Immunofluorescence—DO11.10 cells were transfected with HDAC7-GFP fusion constructs and, where indicated, with PKD1 expression vectors. After transfection, cells were stimulated for 1 h with PMA/ionomycin, PMA, ionomycin, or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Proteins were localized by immunofluorescence microscopy with an Olympus BX60 confocal fluorescence microscope (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed according to standard procedures (27.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-PKD1 and anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-tubulin antibody was from Sigma. Anti-mouse Nur77 antibody was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The antibody specific for PKD1 phosphorylated at Ser744 and Ser748 was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). GST Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assays—These assays were performed as described (28.Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Peptide Injection of Mice—DO11.10 transgenic mice have been described previously (29.Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Balb/c wild-type mice and DO11.10 transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally with 250 μl of a sterile 100 μm solution of ovalbumin peptide (ISQAVHAHAEINEAGR). Mice were sacrificed at the indicated times after injection. A Calcium-independent Pathway Regulates Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of HDAC7—Our previous work (14.Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) has documented that signals emanating from the TCR lead to the phosphorylation of HDAC7 and to its export from the nucleus. Accordingly, treatment of the thymocyte hybridoma cell line DO11.10 with phorbol esters and calcium ionophores (PMA/ionomycin), a treatment that mimics the two main pathways activated by the TCR, led to the nuclear export of an HDAC7-GFP fusion protein. In contrast, an HDAC7 mutant in which phosphorylation was prevented by substituting Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448 with alanines (HDAC7ΔP-GFP) remained in the nucleus (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, treatment with PMA alone (but not ionomycin) led to the nuclear export of HDAC7 (Fig. 1), suggesting that a calcium-independent pathway is responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7 after TCR activation. The HDAC7 mutant was also unresponsive to PMA treatment, indicating that the conserved serines in HDAC7 are potential phosphorylation targets for this intracellular signaling cascade. A PKC/PKD-dependent Pathway Regulates Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of HDAC7 after TCR Activation—To further define the factors involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7, we used a number of specific inhibitors of distinct signaling pathways. Before PMA was added, DO11.10 cells expressing HDAC7-GFP were treated for 30 min with Gö6976, an inhibitor that targets both calcium-dependent PKC isoforms and PKD; with Gö6983 and GF109203X, two general inhibitors of PKCs; with KN62, a specific inhibitor of CaMK; or with cyclosporin A (CsA), a specific inhibitor of calcineurin. Pretreatment with Gö6976, Gö6983, and GF109203X completely inhibited HDAC7 nuclear export mediated by PMA (Fig. 2). In contrast, KN62 and CsA, which inhibit calcium-dependent pathways, had no effect on the cellular distribution of HDAC7 in response to PMA. Importantly, similar results were obtained after cross-linking the T-cell antigen receptor with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, a more physiologically relevant stimulus (Fig. 2). These observations indicate that CaMK and calcineurin are not involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7 after TCR activation and also that a PKC/PKD-dependent mechanism is responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7 after TCR activation. A PKC/PKD-dependent Pathway Controls Nur77 Expression and Transcriptional Activation after TCR Engagement—In view of the key role of HDAC7 in regulating Nur77 expression after TCR activation, we tested the role of a PKC/PKD signaling pathway in Nur77 induction after TCR activation. In agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2, pretreatment with the inhibitors Gö6976, Gö6983, and GF109203X suppressed the induction of Nur77 protein expression in response to PMA, whereas KN62 and CsA surprisingly potentiated the effect of PMA (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained in cells transfected with a construct containing the nur77 promoter driving a luciferase reporter. The PMA-mediated transcriptional activation of the nur77 promoter was inhibited by the PKC inhibitors and potentiated by KN62 and CsA (Fig. 3B). The effects of the same inhibitors were tested after the induction of Nur77 expression by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Pretreatment of DO11.10 cells with the PKC/PKD inhibitor (Gö6976) abolished the induction of Nur77 at the level of both protein expression and promoter induction (Fig. 3, C and D). The other inhibitors (Gö6983, GF109203X, and CsA) partially suppressed Nur77 expression and its promoter (Fig. 3, C and D). The calmodulin inhibitor (KN62) had no effect on the induction of Nur77 after TCR activation, further confirming that CaMKs are not involved in the HDAC7-dependent regulation of Nur77 by PMA or the TCR (Fig. 3, C and D). PKD1 Is Activated in Thymocyte Hybridoma Cells after TCR Engagement—Next, we analyzed the amino acid sequences surrounding the conserved serines in HDAC7 for homology to known consensus protein kinase sites. The three conserved serines in HDAC7 (Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448) and other class IIa HDACs are consensus sites for CaMK ((R/K)XX(S/T)). However, as shown above, chemical blockage of CaMK did not suppress HDAC7 nuclear export after TCR activation. Interestingly, leucine was present at position –5 relative to each serine (Fig. 4A), a requirement for substrates of PKD1 (30.Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKD1 is activated by antigen receptor signals, we used an antibody specific for the active/phosphorylated form of PKD1 (Ser744 and Ser748). Treatment of DO11.10 cells with PMA/ionomycin induced PKD1 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). PMA alone (but not ionomycin) had a similar effect (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that a calcium-independent mechanism is involved. Cell treatment with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody also activated PKD1 (Fig. 4B). To further confirm the activation of PKD1 in DO11.10 cells, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. The cells were treated with PMA/ionomycin, and endogenous PKD1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PKD1 antibody, followed by a kinase assay using myelin basic protein as substrate. Endogenous PKD1 was activated after TCR activation, as indicated by the PKD1 autophosphorylation band and the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that PKD1 is activated in DO11.10 cells by TCR activation independently of calcium signaling. PKD1 Interacts with and Phosphorylates HDAC7—To test whether HDAC7 interacts with PKD1, we incubated GST fusion proteins containing the N terminus (GST-HDAC7(N-ter)) or the C terminus (GST-HDAC7(C-ter)) of HDAC7 after expression in bacteria with extracts of DO11.10 cells, either untreated or treated with PMA/ionomycin. Immunoblotting with an antibody specific for PKD1 revealed that endogenous PKD1 bound to GST-HDAC7(N-ter), but not to GST-HDAC7(C-ter) (Fig. 5A). HDAC7 bound to PKD1 present in resting or activated extracts (PMA/ionomycin) (Fig. 5A), suggesting that enzymatic activation of PKD1 is not necessary for HDAC7 binding. To further confirm the interaction of HDAC7 with PKD1, FLAG-HDAC7 and HA-PKD1 expression plasmids were coexpressed in 293T cells. FLAG-HDAC7 was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitate was probed for the presence of PKD1. Both proteins interacted, regardless of the order of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5B). To investigate whether PKD1 phosphorylates HDAC7 directly, we immunoprecipitated endogenous PKD1 from DO11.10 cells, untreated or treated with PMA/ionomycin, and used it for kinase activity assay with GST-HDAC7(N-ter) or GST-HDAC7(C-ter) as substrate. PKD1 was activated after PMA/ionomycin treatment, as indicated by the PKD1 autophosphorylation band (Fig. 5C). As predicted, only the N-terminal region of HDAC7, which bears the conserved residues Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448, was phosphorylated by PKD1. To confirm that the predicted PKD1 phosphorylation sites were indeed phosphorylated, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using a GST-HDAC7 construct in which the conserved residues Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448 were mutated to alanines (GST-HDAC7ΔP) as substrate. The HDAC7 triple phosphorylation mutant was not phosphorylated by PKD1 after cell treatment with PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 5D). These observations demonstrate the ability of PKD1 to bind and phosphorylate HDAC7 and the requirement for the conserved HDAC7 residues Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448. PKD1 Activity Modulates HDAC7 Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling—Because HDAC7 Ser155, Ser318, and Ser448 were required for nuclear export after TCR activation, we tested whether PKD1 could regulate the subcellular distribution of HDAC7. DO11.10 cells were cotransfected with HDAC7-GFP or the phosphorylation mutant HDAC7ΔP-GFP fusion construct as well as an expression vector for wild-type, constitutively active (PKD1 SS/EE), or kinase-inactive (PKD1 SS/AA) PKD1. HDAC7 was exported to the cytoplasm after PMA treatment in the absence or presence of wild-type PKD1 (Fig. 6). In contrast, overexpression of the constitutively active form of PKD1 (PKD1 SS/EE) led to export of HDAC7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, even in untreated cells (Fig. 6). Importantly, the kinase-inactive form of PKD1 (PKD1 SS/AA) inhibited HDAC7 nuclear export induced by PMA (Fig. 6). The subcellular localization of HDAC7ΔP-GFP was not affected by any stimulus, and the protein was observed in the nucleus under all experimental conditions (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that PKD1 activity is both necessary and sufficient for the regulation of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7. PKD1 Overexpression Activates Nur77 Expression through MEF2—To determine whether PKD1-induced HDAC7 nuclear export is sufficient to activate the nur77 promoter, we cotransfected DO11.10 cells with a nur77 promoter-reporter construct and a vector encoding constitutively active PKD1 (PKD1 SS/EE). PKD1 SS/EE increased the basal transcriptional activity of the nur77 promoter by ∼5-fold; activation was more modest in the presence of PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 7A). We reported previously that HDAC7 overexpression can block the TCR-mediated activation of the nur77 promoter (14.Dequiedt F. Kasler H. Fischle W. Kiermer V. Weinstein M. Herndier B.G. Verdin E. Immunity. 2003; 18: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To test whether PKD1 overexpression can block the repressive activity of HDAC7, we transfected DO11.10 cells with the HDAC7 or HDAC7ΔP expression vector. As expected, overexpression of HDAC7 inhibited the transcriptional activation of Nur77 (75%) induced by PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 7B). Overexpression of constitutively active PKD1 reversed the repressive effect of wild-type HDAC7 (Fig. 7B). Importantly, PKD1 SS/EE had no effect on the transcriptional repression mediated by the HDAC7ΔP phosphorylation mutant (Fig. 7B). To confirm that MEF2 is a target of the PKD1-dependent activation, we cotransfected DO11.10 cells with a reporter construct containing four MEF2D-binding sites upstream of a minimal promoter (pMEF2wt-Luc) and the PKD1 SS/EE expression vector. A construct containing mutant MEF2D-binding sites served as a control (pMEF2mt-Luc). PMA/ionomycin increased the activity of the pMEF2wt-Luc reporter construct by 18-fold, but had no effect on the pMEF2mt-Luc construct (Fig. 7C). Overexpression of PKD1 SS/EE caused a 12-fold activation of pMEF2wt-Luc under basal conditions and further increased its activity in response to PMA/ionomycin (Fig. 7C). As predicted, active PKD1 had no effect on pMEF2mt-Luc (Fig. 7C). PKD1 Is Activated during Negative Selection of T cells—Our observations indicated that PKD1 regulated gene expression in thymocytes during T-cell activation in an MEF2- and HDAC7-dependent manner. To test the relevance of these observations in vivo, we examined the status of PKD1 in a mouse model of negative selection"
https://openalex.org/W2123483502,"Functional compartmentalization of dendrites is thought to underlie afferent-specific integration of neural activity in laminar brain structures. Here we show that in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA), an area lacking apparent laminar organization, thalamic and cortical afferents converge on the same dendrites, contacting neighboring but morphologically and functionally distinct spine types. Large spines contacted by thalamic afferents exhibited larger Ca(2+) transients during action potential backpropagation than did small spines contacted by cortical afferents. Accordingly, induction of Hebbian plasticity, dependent on postsynaptic spikes, was restricted to thalamic afferents. This synapse-specific effect involved activation of R-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels preferentially located at thalamic inputs. These results indicate that afferent-specific mechanisms of postsynaptic, associative Hebbian plasticity in LA projection neurons depend on local, spine-specific morphological and molecular properties, rather than global differences between dendritic compartments."

Here we report that PTPs are differentially oxidized, and we provide evidence for the underlying mechanism.

In contrast, the membrane-distal RPTPα-D2, a poor PTP, was readily oxidized. Oxidized catalytic site cysteines in PTP immunoprobing and mass spectrometry demonstrated that mutation of two residues in the Tyr(P) loop and the WPD loop that reverse catalytic activity of RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 also reversed oxidizability, suggesting that oxidizability and catalytic activity are coupled. However, catalytically active PTP1B and LAR-D1 were readily oxidized. Oxidizability was strongly dependent on pH, indicating that the microenvironment of the catalytic cysteine has an important role. Crystal structures of PTP domains demonstrated that the orientation of the absolutely conserved PTP loop arginine correlates with oxidizability of PTPs, and consistently, RPTPμ-D1, with a similar conformation as RPTPα-D1, was not readily oxidized.

These “classical” PTPs are subdivided into transmembrane, receptor PTPs (RPTPs) (21 genes) and intracellular, nonreceptor PTPs (17 genes). The cytoplasmic PTPs encode a single PTP domain, whereas most RPTPs contain two catalytic domains. The membrane-proximal domain (D1) contains most catalytic activity (6Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T.

Oxidation of cysteine residues to sulfenic acid is reversible, whereas further oxidation to sulfinic (doubly oxidized) or sulfonic (triply oxidized) forms is irreversible (18Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Oxidized PTP1B shows a newly identified bond, termed cyclic sulfenamide, in which the sulfur of the cysteine is covalently linked to the main chain nitrogen of the neighboring serine (19Salmeen A.

Cyclic sulfenamide, like sulfenic acid, can be reduced by thiols, and importantly, it suppresses oxidation to sulfinic and sulfonic acids. There are many physiological stimuli that induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. For instance, ROS are produced in response to stimuli like UV light, growth factors, and insulin, leading to inactivation of PTPs (21Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

For instance, platelet-derived growth factor induces oxidation of Shp2, and N-acetyl cysteine, a ROS quencher, blocks Shp2 oxidation and reduces platelet-derived growth factor signaling (25Meng T.C.

PTPs are emerging as important redox sensors in cells. Recently, we found that RPTPα is regulated by oxidation in an unexpected way. Whereas RPTPα-D1 contains most of the catalytic activity, it appears that RPTPα-D2 is much more sensitive to oxidation than RPTPα-D1 in vitro and in cells in response to UV irradiation (28Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. den Hertog J. Östman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Yet RPTPα is inactivated in response to H2O2 treatment, because RPTPα-D2 undergoes a conformational change in response to oxidation, leading to stabilization of an inactive dimeric conformation (8Blanchetot C.

Mutation of the catalytic cysteine in RPTPα-D2 renders RPTPα less sensitive to oxidation, in that H2O2 and UV treatment of living cells do not lead to complete inactivation of RPTPα-C723S, whereas wild type RPTPα is inactivated completely (8Blanchetot C.

In the present study, we investigated differential oxidation of PTPs. oxPTP immunoprobing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry indicated that the mutations in the Tyr(P) loop and the WPD loop that are responsible for the difference in catalytic activity between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 were also involved in the difference in oxidizability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PTP1B and LAR-D1 were highly oxidizable. The susceptibility of PTPs to oxidation was strongly dependent on pH. Comparison of the crystal structures suggested that the orientation of the PTP loop arginine is important for the oxidizability of PTPs. Taken together, the subtle differences in the microenvironment of the catalytic cysteines determine the oxidizability of PTPs. Constructs—pGEX-based bacterial expression vectors encoding GST fusion proteins of RPTPα-D1 contained the region from amino acids 167 to 503 and RPTPα-D2 from amino acids 504 to 793 (30den Hertog J.

The pGEX construct encoding zebrafish PTP1B (residues 1–282) has been described (31van der Sar A.M. de Fockert J. Betist M. Zivkovic D. den Hertog J. Int. J. Dev.

These constructs were derived by PCR and verified by sequencing. Analysis of Oxidized PTPs Using the oxPTP Antibody—Reversible oxidation was assayed using an antibody, oxPTP, that specifically recognizes the sulfonic acid form of catalytic site cysteines of PTPs (28Persson C.

As outlined in Fig. 1A, following treatment, the sample is alkylated to protect reduced cysteines. Subsequently, the sample is treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce reversibly oxidized cysteines and treated with pervanadate to convert reduced cysteines to the sulfonic acid form. Finally, the sulfonic acid form is detected using the oxPTP antibody by immunoblotting. The procedure has been described in detail (28Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U.

Briefly, GST fusion proteins, purified using standard procedures, were bound to glutathione beads. All of the incubations and washes were done with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, unless otherwise stated. The proteins were reduced for 30 min in 10 mm DTT. The beads were washed twice and were incubated with varying concentrations of H2O2 for 20 min. Immediately after oxidation proteins were alkylated, using 40 mm iodoacetic acid for 30 min. The proteins were washed extensively, reduced with 10 mm DTT, washed twice, and incubated for 1 h with 0.1 mm pervanadate (1 mm pervanadate, 1 mm Na3VO4 mixed with 5 mm H2O2, final concentrations, and left for at least 5 min at room temperature) to convert reduced cysteines irreversibly into the sulfonic acid form. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5 μg of protein/lane). The samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry blotting. For detection with oxPTP antibody, the blots were blocked in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 1 h or overnight and incubated with oxPTP antibody (1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C). Subsequently, horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat-anti-rabbit (1:10,000; BD Pharmigen) was used, and the antibody signals were visualized by ECL. In some cases, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-RPTPα antibody (30den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and subsequently developed using ECL. Phosphatase Assays—Fusion proteins were bound to GST beads in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT. The beads were incubated with varying concentrations of H2O2 for 20 min at pH 7.5 and then directly incubated in 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate for 45 min at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched with 0.4 m NaOH, and optical density was measured with a spectrophotometer at 440 nm (wavelength). MALDI-ToF Mass Spectrometry—All of the reactions and washing steps were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. GST fusion proteins of RPTPα-D2 and mutated RPTPα-D2 (V555Y, E690D, and V555Y/E690D) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 10 mm DTT. The beads were washed and incubated with H2O2 for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the beads were treated with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature to derivatize the unaffected cysteines. Finally, the beads were washed and incubated with 10 mm DTT for 10 min to reduce singly oxidized cysteines. The fusion protein was cleaved off by thrombin protease (4 h at room temperature), and the protein of interest was subjected to overnight tryptic digestion. For desalting, the peptides were adsorbed on C18 ZipTips (Millipore) and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides retained on the columns were eluted using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide mass fingerprint spectra were recorded on a MALDI-ToF Voyager DE-STR (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer operated in positive ion Reflectron mode. After time-delayed extraction, the ions were accelerated to 20 kV for ToF mass spectrometric analysis. A total of 150 shots were acquired, and the signal was averaged per spectrum. MALDI-ToF spectra were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems Data Explorer software. Differential Oxidation of RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2—We investigated oxidation of PTPs using the oxPTP antibody (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a previous report (28Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. den Hertog J. Östman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), RPTPα-D1 was oxidized at 250 μm H2O2 but not at lower concentrations (Fig. 1B), and RPTPα-D2 was already detectably oxidized at the lowest concentration used (31 μm H2O2) (Fig. 1C). The negative control in our oxPTP experiments represents the fully reduced PTP, achieved by treatment with 10 mm DTT for 20 min. For the positive control, the alkylation step was omitted, leading to complete triple oxidation of the catalytic cysteine upon pervanadate treatment (Fig. 1). In parallel with the oxPTP immunoprobing experiments, we performed PTP activity assays using p-nitrophenylphosphate as a substrate. RPTPα-D1 retained much of its activity at low concentrations of H2O2 (31 μm) (Fig. 1D). RPTPα-D2, although much less active than D1, is more susceptible to H2O2 than RPTPα-D1 and is already inactivated at low concentrations of H2O2 (31 μm; Fig. 1D). Together, these results show that RPTPα-D2 is more susceptible to oxidation than RPTPα-D1 as detected by the oxPTP antibody and by PTP activity assays. Two Residues Determine the Difference between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2—Previously, we have shown that the difference in catalytic activity between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 is caused by two residues in the Tyr(P) loop (Tyr262 in D1 and Val555 in D2) and WPD loop (Asp401 in D1 and Glu690 in D2) that are always conserved in catalytically active PTPs and never in inactive RPTP-D2s. The single mutants in RPTPα-D2, E690D and V555Y, regain some of their activity, and the double mutant V555Y/E690D is as active as RPTPα-D1 (12Lim K.L. Kolatkar P.R. Ng K.P. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. J.

Whereas wild type RPTPα-D2 was oxidized at 31 μm H2O2, RPTPα-D2-V555Y was only oxidized at 125 μm H2O2 and above (Fig. 2A). Even higher levels of H2O2 were required for RPTPα-D2-E690D oxidation (Fig. 2A). Moreover, RPTPα-D2-V555Y/E690D oxidation was only detected at 1 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2A). To test whether the Tyr(P) loop and the WPD motif were responsible for low oxidizability of RPTPα-D1, Tyr262 was mutated to valine, and Asp401 was mutated to glutamate. RPTPα-D1-Y262V and RPTPα-D1-D401E were much more sensitive to oxidation than wild type RPTPα-D1, in that appreciable oxidation was already detected at 31–62 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2B), similar to wild type RPTPα-D2. These results support the hypothesis that the Tyr(P) loop and WPD loop are important for susceptibility to oxidation of RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2. We determined the catalytic activity of RPTPα-D1, RPTPα-D2, and their mutants, allowing direct comparison of PTP activity and oxidizability. Consistent with previous results (12Lim K.L. Kolatkar P.R.

Mutation of Asp401 and Tyr262 completely abolished RPTPα-D1 activity (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the Tyr(P) loop and WPD loop are essential for catalytic activity. Mass spectrometry experiments were performed to further investigate oxidation of RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2. Unfortunately, the Cys433 containing peptide of RPTPα-D1 did not resolve well in the MALDI-ToF spectra, and detection of Cys433 oxidation failed. The peptide containing Cys723 of RPTPα-D2 and its oxidized derivatives were readily detectable by MALDI-ToF (Fig. 3). At 1 mm H2O2, four peaks were evident in the spectra. As a result of the alkylation/reduction procedure, the reversibly oxidized Cys723 peptide was detected in its reduced form (m/z 2075.98), whereas alkylated Cys723 peptide corresponds to reduced Cys723 peptide (m/z 2133.00). The other two peaks, m/z 2107.98 and 2123.98, represent irreversibly oxidized RPTPα-D2, with relative mass shifts of +32 and +48 corresponding to the formation of the sulfinic and sulfonic acid species, respectively. Reversibly oxidized Cys723 peptide was already detected at the lowest concentrations of H2O2 (31 μm), and the fraction of reversibly oxidized Cys723 peptide increased gradually with increasing H2O2 concentrations (Fig. 3). The sulfinic acid species were only detected at high H2O2 concentrations (250 μm H2O2 and higher) and sulfonic acid only at 1 mm H2O2. Based on the MALDI-ToF spectra, we calculated the fraction of reversibly oxidized Cys723 peptide, relative to the total amount of Cys723 peptide. Wild type RPTPα-D2 was highly sensitive to oxidation, whereas RPTPα-D2-E690D was moderately sensitive, showing low levels of reversible oxidation at low H2O2 concentrations (Fig. 3). RPTPα-D2-V555Y and RPTPα-E690D/V555Y were the least sensitive to oxidation, because for both mutants significant oxidation was detected only at high concentrations of H2O2 (250 μm and higher; Fig. 3). The sulfinic and sulfonic acid form of Cys723 peptides in the MALDI-ToF spectra of RPTPα-D2 were not detected in any of the mutants (data not shown), again pointing toward a decreased sensitivity to oxidation for all mutants. The MALDI-ToF results are consistent with the oxPTP antibody data. The oxidation and PTP activity results (Figs. 2 and 3) demonstrate that the two residues that determine the difference in catalytic activity between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 are also responsible for the difference in oxidizability, which may suggest that PTP catalytic activity and oxidizability are linked. Oxidizability of PTP1B and LAR—Our results suggest an inverse relation between catalytic activity and oxidizability. However, other PTPs that are catalytically active have been reported to be oxidized. Therefore, we investigated oxidation of PTP1B in parallel to RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2. Oxidation of zebrafish PTP1B in which the oxPTP epitope (VHCSAG) is fully conserved (31van der Sar A.M. de Fockert J. Betist M. Zivkovic D. den Hertog J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 785-794PubMed Google Scholar) was readily detected at very low levels of H2O2 (31 μm), and PTP1B oxidation was maximal at 125–250 μm H2O2 (Fig. 4), similar to RPTPα-D2 (Fig. 1C). PTP1B is catalytically active (data not shown), arguing against an inverse correlation between catalytic activity and oxidation. Next, we investigated oxidizability of the two catalytic domains of the RPTP, LAR. Both LAR-D1 and LAR-D2 were readily oxidized at low H2O2 concentrations (31 μm) with maximal oxidation levels at 125–250 μm, like RPTPα-D2 and PTP1B (Fig. 4). PTP activity assays that were done in parallel demonstrate that LAR-D1 is catalytically active and LAR-D2 is not (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (6Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Taken together, the finding that the catalytically active PTP1B and LAR-D1 are readily oxidized indicates that there is not a strict inverse correlation between catalytic activity and oxidizability. Because the Tyr(P) loop and WPD loop are conserved in PTP1B and LAR-D1, other features of the PTPs must play a role in determining the sensitivity to oxidation. Gly259 in PTP1B (Gln474 in RPTPα-D1 and His764 in RPTPα-D2) is an important determinant of substrate specificity (34Peters G.H. Iversen L.F. Branner S. Andersen H.S. Mortensen S.B. Olsen O.H. Moller K.B. Moller N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18201-18209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and determines the flexibility of Gln262 in the Q loop of the catalytic pocket (35Peters G.H. Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Moller N.P. Olsen O.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8418-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Gly259 might therefore be involved in the difference in oxidizability between PTP1B and RPTPα-D1. We mutated Gln474 in RPTPα-D1 and His764 in RPTPα-D2 to glycine, the residue at the corresponding position in PTP1B. RPTPα-D1-Q474G was poorly oxidized (Fig. 4), like wild type RPTPα-D1 (Fig. 1B). RPTPα-D2-H764G was readily oxidized (Fig. 4), like wild type RPTPα-D2 (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that Gly259, a determinant of substrate specificity in PTP1B and RPTPα, is not involved in differential oxidation of PTPs. Extensive comparison of the primary sequences of the PTPs involved did not lead to the identification of residues that might be responsible for the difference in oxidizability, except for three residues that are conserved in RPTPα-D1 (331TNL333) and RPTPα-D2 (624TEL626) but not in PTP1B (109NRV111). Thr331 is buried in the catalytic pocket of RPTPα-D1 close to the catalytic Cys433 and therefore might have a role in oxidizability of Cys433. We mutated Thr331 and the two following residues to the corresponding residues in PTP1B (T → N, TN → NR, and TNL → NRV) and investigated oxidizability and catalytic activity of the mutants. However, these mutants were not catalytically active, and oxidation was not detectable using the oxPTP antibody (data not shown), suggesting that these mutations severely disrupted the conformation of the catalytic pocket. pH-dependent PTP Oxidation—Cysteine residues are most vulnerable to oxidation in the thiolate anion form. Therefore, the pH may be an important determinant for oxidation of PTPs. It is well known that the catalytic activity of PTPs is strongly dependent on pH (36Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 37Peters G.H. Branner S. Moller K.B. Andersen J.N. Moller N.P. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We assayed the PTP activity of RPTPα-D1, RPTPα-D2, RPTPα-D2-V555Y/E690D, and PTP1B at different pH. PTPs are highly active at low pH (optimum activity at pH 5.5–6.0 for all PTPs tested). PTP activity decreased rapidly with increasing pH to 10% of the maximum activity at pH 8.0. It is noteworthy that although the absolute activity of the four PTPs tested is different (PTP1B > RPTPα-D1 > RPTPα-D2-V555Y/E690D >> RPTPα-D2), the pH-dependent decrease in activity is very similar (Fig. 5A). To investigate whether oxidation is a pH-dependent process, H2O2 treatment was done at a range of different pHs. Three H2O2 concentrations were used that are indicative of oxidizability, 31, 62, and 125 μm. Strikingly, the oxidizability of RPTPα-D1 was clearly dependent on pH in that RPTPα-D1 was oxidized in response to low levels of H2O2 (31 μm) at pH 8.5 and 9.0 (Fig. 5B). RPTPα-D2 oxidation was not affected by elevating the pH, but lowering the pH to 7.0 and 6.5 gradually reduced oxidation of RPTPα-D2 (Fig. 5B). PTP1B was sensitive to oxidation at pH 7.5 and, like RPTPα-D2, lost its sensitivity when the pH was lowered to 6.5. RPTPα-D2-V555Y/E690D responded to different pHs much like RPTPα-D1, in that RPTPα-D2-V555Y/E690D was oxidized at high pH (pH 8.5 and 9.0). Taken together, these results demonstrate that oxidation of PTPs is strongly dependent on the pH, suggesting that the microenvironment of the catalytic cysteines has an important role. PTP loop Arginine Is Important for Oxidizability—The crystal structures of the PTPs involved have all been solved: RPTPα-D1 (38Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), RPTPα-D2 (11Sonnenburg E.D. Bilwes A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7904-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), PTP1B (9Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and LAR-D1 and LAR-D2 (10Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Comparison of the microenvironment of the catalytic cysteine of these five PTPs indicated that the absolutely conserved PTP loop arginine is oriented differently in RPTPα-D1 than in RPTPα-D2, PTP1B, or LAR (Fig. 6). We determined the distance between the Sγ atom of the catalytic cysteine and the three N atoms of the guanidinium group of the arginine (Table I). Strikingly, the Nη1 atom was much closer to the Sγ atom of the catalytic cysteine in RPTPα-D1 than in the other PTPs (4.9 Å versus 7.1–8.0 Å; Table I). The Nϵ atoms were located at similar distances in all five PTPs (5.2–6.1 Å), whereas the Nη2 atoms were partially buried in most structures at similar distances to the Sγ atom (6.1–7.3 Å). The proximity of the Nη1 atom to the Sγ atom may account for the difference in oxidizability between RPTPα-D1 and other PTPs, because the guanidinium group of Arg439 may sterically hinder the reaction of H2O2 with the thiolate group of Cys433.Table IDifference in microenvironment of the catalytic cysteine in RPTPα -D1 and RPTPμ -D1 compared to other PTPsPTPNϵ-SγNη1-SγNη2-SγRPTPα-D15.5934.8576.904RPTPα-D25.7247.4637.041LAR-D16.0437.9927.127LAR-D26.1137.9517.329PTP1B5.2327.1026.081RPTPμ-D14.9345.4656.874TC-PTP5.0667.0077.304Shp-15.1536.2567.058Shp-25.7017.4187.223PTP-SL6.0887.8946.906YOP515.8187.5046.073 Open table in a new tab We analyzed the crystal structures of other classical PTPs, RPTPμ-D1, TC-PTP, Shp-1, Shp-2, PTP-SL, and YOP51. We found that only in RPTPμ-D1, was the guanidinium group of the PTP loop arginine oriented similarly as in RPTPα-D1 (Fig. 6), and the Nη1 atom was relatively close to the Sγ atom (5.5 Å; Table I). Indeed, RPTPμ-D1 was only oxidized at high H2O2 concentrations (Fig. 4), similar to RPTPα-D1. Our results are consistent with a crucial role for the PTP loop arginine in the oxidizability of PTPs. Oxidation is an attractive regulatory mechanism for PTPs, because ROS are readily formed in response to various stimuli, and oxidation is reversible. Here, we report that PTPs were oxidized differentially, which may be important for fine-tuning of the cellular responses to stimuli. We demonstrate that oxidizability and catalytic activity of RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 were reversed upon mutation of two residues in the Tyr(P) loop and WPD loop that are absolutely conserved in catalytically active PTPs but not in RPTP-D2s. However, these two residues cannot explain the difference in oxidizability between RPTPα-D1 on the one hand and the catalytically active PTPs, PTP1B, and LAR-D1 on the other, because these residues are conserved in all active PTPs. We found that oxidation of PTPs was highly dependent on pH, and we identified the PTP loop arginine as an important determinant in oxidizability. oxPTP immunoprobing, PTP activity assays, and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry consistently showed differential oxidation of purified RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 in vitro. We have previously shown that Cys723, the catalytic cysteine of RPTPα-D2, is preferentially oxidized in living cells in response to UV treatment (28Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. den Hertog J. Östman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys723, but not Cys433, abolished oxidation of full-length RPTPα in living cells. Moreover, differential oxidizability of RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 is consistent with previous data that RPTPα-D2 rather than RPTPα-D1 is the redox sensor. Mutation of Cys723 renders full-length RPTPα at least in part insensitive to oxidation, in that H2O2 treatment or UV treatment of living cells completely inactivates wild type RPTPα, but not RPTPα-C723S (8Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. den Hertog J. Östman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). H2O2-induced inactivation of RPTPα is due to a conformational change in RPTPα-D2, which leads to stabilization of an inactive RPTPα dimer conformation (8Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29van der Wijk T. Blanchetot C. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13968-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). How RPTPα-D2 changes conformation in response to H2O2 remains elusive and will require elucidation of the crystal structure of oxidized RPTPα-D2. The catalytic Cys723 is required for the conformational change (8Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and recently we found evidence that none of the other cysteines in RPTPα is involved in H2O2-induced stable dimer formation (39van der Wijk T. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44355-44361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), ruling out the possibility of intramolecular disulfide bond formation, which has been observed in nonclassical Cys-based PTPs, including LMW-PTP (40Caselli A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20535-20540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It is likely that the conformational change in RPTPα-D2 is initiated by cyclic sulfenamide formation, which leads to extensive reorganization of the catalytic site of PTP1B (19Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Nature. 2003; 423: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 20van Montfort R.L. Congreve M. Tisi D. Carr R. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 423: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Although oxidizability of RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 was reversed upon mutation of only two residues in the Tyr(P) loop and WPD loop (Figs. 2 and 3), this cannot explain the difference in oxidizability between PTP1B, LAR-D1, and RPTPα-D1 (Fig. 4), because the Tyr(P) loop and WPD loop are conserved in all three active PTPs. Oxidation of PTPs is strongly dependent on pH (Fig. 5), suggesting that the microenvironment of the catalytic cysteine is an important determinant for oxidizability. Comparison of the crystal structures of the classical PTPs suggested that the orientation of the PTP loop arginine was important. The orientation of the PTP loop arginine in RPTPμ-D1 suggested that RPTPμ-D1 would not be highly susceptible to oxidation. Indeed, like RPTPα-D1, RPTPμ-D1 was relatively insensitive to oxidation (Fig. 4). The proximity of the PTP loop arginine to the catalytic cysteine may sterically hinder the reaction of H2O2 with the thiolate anion group. To directly test the role of the PTP loop arginine in oxidizability, we mutated Arg439 to lysine in RPTPα-D1. Unfortunately, GST-RPTPα-D1-R439K was not stable, and we did not obtain sufficient material to determine the oxidation of this fusion protein. It is not clear why the guanidinium group of Arg439 is oriented differently in RPTPα-D1 than in most other PTPs. Unlike the other crystal structures, RPTPα-D1 formed dimers in the crystals in which a helix loop-helix wedge-like structure inserts into the catalytic site of the dyad-related monomer (38Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), which may affect the orientation of the guanidinium group. However, the position of the PTP loop arginine and particularly its guanidinium group in RPTPμ-D1, which did not form dimers like RPTPα-D1 in crystals (43Hoffmann K.M. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27505-27508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is similar to that in RPTPα-D1, indicating that this conformation is not driven by dimerization. It is noteworthy that differential oxidation of PTPs is especially obvious at relatively low H2O2 concentrations. Cellular stimuli induce H2O2 concentrations in a range, similar to the H2O2 concentrations we have used for our experiments. For instance, platelet-derived growth factor induces ROS levels in cells that are comparable with the levels in cells resulting from exogenously added H2O2 concentrations of 0.1–1.0 mm (21Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). Differential oxidation of PTPs is important for fine-tuning of the cellular response to ROS production. Apparently, different inactivating mechanisms have evolved in the RPTPs: direct oxidation of the catalytic cysteine in LAR and indirect inactivation through oxidation of the catalytic cysteine in RPTPα-D2, resulting in stabilization of an inactive dimer conformation (8Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29van der Wijk T. Blanchetot C. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13968-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). LAR-D2 does undergo a conformational change in response to H2O2, like RPTPα-D2, and H2O2 induces heterodimer formation between full-length RPTPα and LAR (44Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47263-47269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whether oxidation of LAR-D2 is required for full inactivation of LAR remains to be determined. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PTPs are differentially oxidized, and we provide evidence for the underlying mechanism. It will be interesting to see whether other PTP family members, including the nonclassical Cys-based PTPs, are differentially oxidized as well. We thank Tony Hunter for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2050377476,"The lateral line is a placodally derived mechanosensory organ in anamniotes that detects the movement of water. In zebrafish embryos, a migrating primordium deposits seven to nine clusters of sensory hair cells, or neuromasts, at intervals along the trunk. Postembryonically, neuromasts continue to be added. We show that some secondary neuromasts arise from a pool of latent precursors that are deposited by the primordium between primary neuromasts. Interneuromast cells lie adjacent to the lateral line nerve and associated glia. These cells remain quiescent while they are juxtaposed with the glia; however, when they move away from the nerve they increase proliferation and form neuromasts. If glia are manually removed or genetically ablated by mutations in cls/sox10, hypersensitive (hps), or rowgain (rog), neuromasts precociously differentiate. Transplantation of wt glia into mutants rescues the appropriate temporal differentiation of interneuromast cells. Our studies reveal a role for glia in regulating sensory hair cell precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2080757873,"In this study a novel biological activity of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in C2C12 myoblasts was identified. In these cells the bioactive lipid profoundly regulated myogenesis exerting an antimitogenic activity, by reducing serum-induced cell proliferation, and acting as powerful prodifferentiating agent by enhancing the expression of myogenic differentiation markers such as myogenin, myosin heavy chain, and caveolin-3. The S1P-dependent diminution of serum-induced labeled thymidine incorporation was abrogated by antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODN) to S1P2, but not to S1P1 or S1P3 receptor, also expressed in C2C12 cells, implicating S1P2 in the biological response. Using antisense ODN and short interfering RNA treatment, we highlighted the key role played by S1P2 in the S1P-dependent induction of muscle-specific gene products. Notably, S1P2 overexpression increased the content of myogenic markers and hastened the onset of differentiated muscle phenotype in comparison with control cells. Cell treatment with pertussis toxin did not affect the biological responses to S1P, ruling out the involvement of Gi-mediated events in the signaling promoted by the sphingolipid. Among the various signaling pathways activated by S1P, the activation of ERK1/ERK2 and p38 MAPK, both identified as downstream effectors of S1P2, was required for the inhibition of cell proliferation and the stimulation of myogenic differentiation, respectively."

In either case, the signaling cascade results in an increased intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i), due to IP3-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores and influx of extracellular Ca2+. Such increases in [Ca2+]i have a critical role in regulating a wide variety of cellular functions, such as secretion and gene expression. In polarized cells, e.g. neuronal and epithelial cells, Ca2+-regulated cellular functions are often restricted to specific microdomains (4.Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5.Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Luo X. Ko S.B. Muallem S. Adv. Exp. Med.

Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that local changes in [Ca2+]i are determined by the targeted localization of specific Ca2+-signaling proteins within that domain. In polarized exocrine gland epithelial cells, there are convincing functional and biochemical data to demonstrate that Ca2+-signaling proteins as well as initial [Ca2+]i changes occur in the apical region. More importantly, cellular functions such as protein and fluid secretion as well as ion re-absorption occur via the apical membrane of acinar and ductal cells, respectively, in these glands and are regulated by agonist-stimulated [Ca2+]i increases. Thus, it has been proposed that Ca2+-signaling events are strategically localized in order to facilitate the regulation of these cellular functions (4.Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6.Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell.

For example, Ca2+-mobilizing agonists activate apical chloride channels in salivary gland and pancreatic acinar cells, and it has been demonstrated that this is mediated via an increase in [Ca2+]i at the apical pole of these cells. This has been further confirmed by studies showing that agonist-stimulated release of Ca2+ initially occurs from internal stores localized in the apical region of cells (6.Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7.Petersen O.H. J. Korean Med. Sci. 2000; 15: S44-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 8.Petersen O.H. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Most importantly, this internal Ca2+ release has been correlated with the relative abundance of IP3Rs in this region. However, relatively less is known about the site of Ca2+ influx that is stimulated in response to receptor-activated PIP2 hydrolysis. Based on recent studies, it can be suggested that two types of Ca2+ influx pathways can be activated following stimulation of plasma membrane receptors that are coupled to PIP2 hydrolysis. The first type of influx depends on PIP2 hydrolysis (but not on store depletion), whereas the second influx mechanism is associated with store depletion per se (10.Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that store depletion-regulated Ca2+ influx occurs via the basolateral membrane of exocrine gland acinar cells (11.Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, whether additional receptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx occurs in the apical region of cells where the Ca2+-signaling proteins and initial [Ca2+]i increases occur and are localized is not yet known. The TRPC subfamily of ion channel proteins form Ca2+-permeable cation channels that are activated by agonist stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis (12.Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;Jul 10/RE1Google Scholar, 13.Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). TRPC3, -6, and -7 form agonist-regulated channels that can also be directly activated by DAG (14.Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas TRPC1 and TRPC4 appear to form store-operated channels in some cell types (15.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16.Freichel M. Suh S.H.

Furthermore, a number of the TRPC proteins, e.g. TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4, form heteromeric channels and are assembled in a complex with key Ca2+-signaling proteins (18.Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19.Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be proposed that interaction of TRPCs with Ca2+-signaling proteins localizes the channels to the same microdomain where Ca2+-signaling events are initiated. This localization likely facilitates not only activation of the TRPC channels in response to stimulation of Ca2+-signaling events but also regulation of the downstream cellular functions that are dependent on Ca2+ influx. A number of TRPC proteins are expressed in every cell type (12.Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/fullOC_sigtrans;Jul 10/RE1Google Scholar, 13.Minke B. Cook B. Physiol.

However, with the exception of murine TRPC2 (23.Liman E.R. Corey D.P. Dulac C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the physiological function of TRPC channels is not yet known. Furthermore, cellular factors that determine the heteromeric interactions between TRPCs have also not been defined. As noted above, (i) Ca2+-signaling proteins are present in the apical region of salivary and pancreatic epithelial cells, and (ii) TRPC proteins have been reported to associate with each other and with Ca2+-signaling proteins. Thus, we have examined the localization of TRPC channels (TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6) in polarized epithelial cells and have assessed the site of Ca2+ entry. Cell Culture and Transfection—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and submandibular immortalized epithelial cells (SMIE) were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). For stably transfected MDCK cells, media were supplemented with 600 μg/ml geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). MDCK cells (at 70–80% confluency) were treated with a mixture containing 1 μg of the required plasmid and 40 μg of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM. After 5 h, the mixture was replaced with fresh DMEM containing serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). 48–72 h after transfection, cells were replated at low density and placed in G418 media for 2–3 weeks to select for stably transfected cells. Clones of G418-resistant cells were screened for protein expression, and those with the highest expression were chosen for use in this study. For each protein, the results were verified with at least two independently derived stable cell clones. Transient transfection of SMIE cells was performed using 1 μg of the required plasmid combined with 2.4 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and added to cells grown overnight in a 24-mm Transwell filter. After 5 h, serum-free medium was replaced with normal growth medium. The positions of the TAGs in the TRPC proteins were as follows: exo-HA-TRPC3, between TM-3 and -4; FLAG-TRPC3, C-terminal; HA-TRPC1, N-terminal; HA-TRPC6, C-terminal. Measurement of Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TER)—TER across cell monolayers was measured as described previously (24.He X. Kuijpers G.A. Goping G. Kulakusky J.A. Zheng C. Delporte C. Tse C.M. Redman R.S. Donowitz M. Pollard H.B. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 435: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 per well and grown to confluence in 24-mm Transwell culture chambers (Corning Costar). TER measurements were made with a Millicell ERS epithelial voltohmmeter (Millipore, Allen, TX) as described by the manufacturer. Experiments were performed in triplicate with three separate cell preparations. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. Student's t test was used for statistical evaluation of the values; p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Crude Membrane Preparation—Cells were grown in tissue culture plates and harvested by scraping into ice-cold PBS containing 1% (v/v) aprotinin (Sigma) and centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing (in mm) the following: 10 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 MgCl2, 0.5 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (INC Biomedical Inc., Aurora, OH), 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem) and frozen at -80 °C for at least 2 h before use. Crude membranes were prepared from cell lysates by homogenization and centrifugation as described previously (18.Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19.Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay (microassay procedure). Generation of Anti-TRPC3 Antibody—Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against TRPC3 was generated by injecting New Zealand White male rabbits with the peptide MREKGRRQAVRGPAFMFNDRC (corresponding to an N-terminal sequence) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Initial injection was with Complete Freund's Adjuvant, and boost injections at days 14, 21, and 49 were with Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. Rabbit injections, bleeds, and housing were performed by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). Antibodies were affinity-purified by using the antibody peptide coupled to the Pierce Biotechnology Ultralink iodoacetyl column, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples containing endogenous and expressed TRPC3-FLAG were examined by using this antibody, another anti-TRPC3 antibody (raised against the N terminus of TRPC3, generously provided by Dr. Craig Montell), and anti-FLAG antibody to confirm the specificity of the antibody. Furthermore, incubation with the peptide decreased detection of the TRPC3 protein. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging—All steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise mentioned. The cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min, rinsed with PBS, and treated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 20 min. Cells were then washed and permeabilized with methanol at -20 °C for 5 min. Following incubation with a blocking solution containing 5% donkey serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS/bovine serum albumin, and probed with the required FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The filter was excised from its support and mounted onto a slide with antifade reagent (Ted Pella, Inc.). Fluorescence images were taken by using a confocal laser-scanning microscope Leica TCS-SP2 attached to an upright Leica DM-RE7 microscope. Details of the images are indicated in the figure and text. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Polarized MDCK cells were lysed by addition of octyl glucoside and KI (18.Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19.Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation from the cell lysate was done as described previously (19.Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). For TRPC3-FLAG, 200 μg of Sepharose beads cross-linked to anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used. For TRPC6, anti-TRPC6 antibody (Sigma) was used followed by addition of Sepharose beads. Protein-bound beads were separated by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant was saved (unbound fraction). The beads were washed, and bound proteins (IP fraction) were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min and were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Western blotting as described previously (19.Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) using anti-FLAG (1:1000), anti-HA (1:1000, Roche Applied Science), anti-Gαq/11 (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-PLCβ1 (1:500, gift from Dr. Sue Goo Rhee), -β2 and -β3 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-syntaxin 3 (24.He X.

The cell culture medium was removed, and the upper (apical) and lower (basal) chambers were washed with SES medium (details are given in the figure legends). As indicated, medium in the required chamber (0.7 ml per chamber) was supplemented with 45Ca2+. Other reagents were added as described in the text and figures. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the required time periods, after which the filters were removed, rinsed in ice-cold medium containing 500 μm LaCl3, cut out from the manifold, and placed in scintillation vials with scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was determined. For transepithelial flux, an aliquot of the basal medium was sampled. Values are represented relative to the respective controls in which uptake was measured from the same chamber without stimulation of cells. Immunocytochemistry—Adult male Wistar rats (weighing 200–250 g) were kept under environmentally controlled conditions (12:12 h light/dark cycle, 20–22 °C) with food and water available ad libitum until used. All animals were treated according to guidelines approved by the NIDCR, National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee. Submandibular glands were excised from the animals and fixed in 10% formalin solution for 24 h for immunocytochemistry, dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and used to prepare 5–10-μm-thick sections (American Histolabs, Gaithersburg, MD). Immunocytochemistry was performed on paraffin sections of rat submandibular gland. Sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol solution (70–100%), and incubated for 10 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.5) for permeabilization. Sections were then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 min and preincubated for 1 h in PBS containing 5% goat serum, followed by avidin-biotin blocking. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPC3 (1:100) and TRPC6 (1:150) antibodies, rinsed, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, followed by streptavidin-peroxidase complex, and finally developed with 3,3′diaminobenzidine using the Histostain kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). In control sections, rabbit IgG was used instead of the primary antibody. Crude Membrane Preparation—For crude membrane preparation, the brain and submandibular gland were collected immediately after rats were euthanized and were immersed in chilled sucrose buffer containing the protease inhibitors. Membranes were prepared as described above after mincing and dispersion of the tissue by using a Polytron tissue homogenizer. Dispersed Cell Preparation from Rat SMG and [Ca2+]i Measurements—Submandibular glands were removed and placed in ice-cold external solution with 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Each gland was cleaned and finely minced. The minced tissue was transferred to 8 ml of external solution containing 4 mg of collagenase P. The tube was gassed and capped. After 15–20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the digest was washed twice with the normal external solution followed by a 2–4-min centrifugation at 100 × g and resuspended in about 4 ml of external solution + 0.1% BSA + 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor. For microfluorimetry, cells were loaded with fura 2 for 45–60 min at 30 °C and placed in a poly-l-lysine-coated glass bottom dish (Matek Corp.) and allowed to attach. Ducts and acinar cells from the same glands were morphologically identified by their distinctive appearance under microscopic examination (26.Xu X. Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made using a Till Photonics-Polychrome IV spectrofluorimeter and Metafluor Imaging System, Universal Imaging Corp. Measurements of Fluo-4 Fluorescence by Confocal Microscopy in Polarized MDCK Cells—MDCK cells stably expressing TRPC3 were grown in Transwell filters to establish polarization, and TER was measured to confirm this. Cells were incubated with 5 μm fluo-4/acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 1 h in SES medium. Samples were scanned on a TCS SP2 Leica confocal microscope system using a 40 × 0.8 NA dipping objective. Single Transwell inserts were washed; 2 ml of SES medium was added (apical chamber), and the inserts were placed in 35 mm chambers containing 2.5 ml of SES medium (basal chamber). All additions were made to the apical chamber. Samples were scanned in XZ time mode for 5 min total time with 12-s increments between sampling. Calculations of the mean intensity in a defined region of interest were made using the histogram function in the Leica LCS Lite software and analyzing whole cell, basal, and apical regions throughout the time series. Localization of TRPC Proteins in Polarized Epithelial Cells— TRPC3-FLAG, TRPC1-HA, and TRPC6-HA were stably expressed in MDCK cells. To determine their localization in polarized cells, TRPC-expressing MDCK cells were cultured on Transwell filters, and TER was monitored to assess the formation of a tight monolayer of polarized cells. Control MDCK cells developed maximum TER in about 3 days, and this was not altered by TRPC expression (Fig. 1A). Note that in all experiments described below, TER measurements were first made to ensure polarization of cells. Fig. 1B shows the expression of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 in two clones that were used, in each case, in the experiments described below. After 3 days in culture, immunofluorescence was used to detect syntaxin 3, a marker protein for apical membranes in MDCK cells; Na+/K+-ATPase, a marker protein for basolateral membrane; and Z01, a marker protein for the tight junction. The localization of these proteins in control polarized MDCK cells is shown in Fig. 1C (upper panels show stacked images, left; and a section with the x-z and z-y views, right; lower panels show enlarged images of the latter). As expected for MDCK cells (27.Mostov K. Su T. ter Beest M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 28.Nelson W.J. Nature. 2003; 422: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), syntaxin 3 was apically localized; Na+/K+-ATPase was basolateral, and ZO1 was detected in the tight junction region, between the cells, toward the apical pole. Note that when MDCK cells were grown on plastic, the proteins were detected all over the cell membrane (images are not shown). Furthermore, the localization of these marker proteins was similar in polarized MDCK cells stably expressing TRPC3 (Fig. 1D). Localization of exogenously expressed TRPC3-FLAG was detected using the anti-FLAG antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (green denotes localization of TRPC3-FLAG, and red shows the location of the nucleus, which was stained with propidium iodide). In a stacked image of the cells grown on the filter (Fig. 2A), TRPC3 appears to be in the apical region. This is more clearly seen in the x-z and z-y sections, where TRPC3 signal is predominantly detected in the apical membrane region of the cells (Fig. 2, B–D). Fig. 2E shows co-localization of syntaxin 3 and TRPC3-FLAG, further confirming the apical localization of TRPC3-FLAG in polarized MDCK cells. TRPC3 did not show polarized localization when grown on plastic (data not shown). We further examined localization of TRPC3 in a salivary gland epithelial cell line (SMIE) (24.He X. Kuijpers G.A. Goping G. Kulakusky J.A. Zheng C. Delporte C. Tse C.M. Redman R.S. Donowitz M. Pollard H.B. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 435: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which also forms polarized, high resistance monolayers on Transwell filters (TER measurements are not shown). As in MDCK cells, TRPC3-FLAG was seen in the apical membrane of polarized SMIE cells (SMIE, Fig. 2F). Notably, this localization was not an artifact due to the FLAG epitope tag because TRPC3-HA was similarly localized in the apical region of SMIE cells (Fig. 2G) and in MDCK cells (image not shown). Most importantly, the HA tag in this TRPC3 was inserted in the external domain (between TM-3 and -4), and apical TRPC3-HA was detected in nonpermeabilized cells. These data demonstrate surface expression of TRPC3 in the apical membrane. The localization of exogenously expressed TRPC1-HA and TRPC6-HA was also examined in MDCK cells. Consistent with our previous studies with salivary gland acinar cells (15.Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

TRPC6-HA was localized in both basolateral and apical regions of the cells (Fig. 2I). Thus, both TRPC3 and TRPC6 are localized in the apical region of the cells as would be predicted by previous reports demonstrating that these two proteins interact to form heteromeric channels. TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 are endogenously present in MDCK cells (Fig. 2J). Consistent with the localizat"

To develop a test of this possibility, we reconstituted the capture of APP and PS1 in COPII (coat protein complex II) vesicles formed from ER membranes in permeabilized cultured cells. The recombinant forms of mammalian COPII proteins were active in a reaction that measures coat subunit assembly and coated vesicle budding on chemically defined synthetic liposomes.

The recombinant Sec24C specifically recognized the APP C-terminal region for packaging. Titration of Sarla distinguished the packaging requirements of APP and PS1.

Several lines of evidence are consistent with the idea that PS serves as a trafficking regulator of other membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. PS1 is localized in the ER and in early Golgi membranes in the steady state where it may guide the transport of TrkB and make physical contact with Notch and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Annaert W.G.

By analogy in the cholesterol regulatory pathway, SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) traffic and proteolytic activation are guided by SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) (for review, see Ref. 6Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Similarly, PS may somehow guide the traffic and proteolytic cleavage of APP by the α-, β-, and γ-secretases. A biochemical analysis of the traffic of PS and APP from the ER would permit an evaluation of their transport interdependence or independence. Sec23/24p, Sec13/31p, and Sar1p are the cytosolic coat proteins, called COPII, responsible for the formation of ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport vesicles (7Lee M.C.S. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The action of COPII proteins is confined to the ER membrane due to a specific interaction of the GTP-binding protein, Sar1p, with the ER-bound GTP exchange factor for Sar1p, Sec12p (8Barlowe C. Schekman R. Nature. 1993; 365: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 9Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound form of Sar1p sequentially recruits the Sec23/24p complex and the Sec13/31p complex to the ER membrane, resulting in deformation of the membrane and packaging of cargo proteins into transport vesicles. Sec23p functions as a GTPase-activating protein for Sar1p (10Yoshihisa T. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Science. 1993; 259: 1466-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Sec13/31p further stimulates the GTPase-activating protein activity of Sec23p about 10-fold, resulting in the release of coat proteins from the membranes (11Antonny B. Madden D. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, maintenance of the coat on the membrane is affected by Sec12p, Sec23/24p, and Sec13/31p (12Futai E. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4286-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sec24p possesses multiple cargo binding sites to package diverse membrane proteins into COPII vesicles (13Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C.S. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 14Mossessova E. Bickford L.C. Goldberg J. Cell. 2003; 114: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Of the COPII proteins, Sec24p has the largest number of homologs in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, likely serving to expand the repertoire of cargo molecules captured for transport (13Miller E.A.

Sec16p, a peripheral membranes protein, interacts with Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec31p (16Espenshade P.J. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J.

To probe the regulatory role of PS in APP trafficking from ER to Golgi, we established a vesicle budding reaction and compared the activity of crude cytosol with purified recombinant mammalian COPII proteins expressed in a baculovirus system. We present evidence that a precursor form of PS1 and APP is independently packaged into COPII vesicles.

Hamster Sar1a Purification—Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) carrying pJK1 or pJK2 were diluted into 1 liter of 2× YT (16 g bacto tryptone, 10 g bacto yeast extract, and 5 g NaCl per liter) medium (1/1000). The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.3, transferred to 25 °C, and further grown to an A600 of 0.8. Expression of hamster Sar1a was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 25 min in a Sorvall RC3B rotor at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended with 25 ml of TBST and treated with lysozyme (0.8 mg/ml) for 20 min at RT with occasional mixing. After incubation Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The cells were sonicated with three pulses of 30 s. Cell debris was removed by successive centrifugations at 1500 rpm in a Sorval SS34 rotor for 30 min and at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman 70Ti rotor for 1 h. The supernatant was mixed with TBST-washed glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (AP Biotech) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation the beads were washed three times with ice-cold TBST, once with TBS, and once with TCB. The beads were transferred into a disposable column and incubated with 4 units of thrombin (Roche Applied Science) for 90 min.

The eluates were dialyzed against HKM supplemented with 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol. Gel Exclusion Chromatography—Aliquots (100 μl) of purified protein samples were applied to a Superose 6 column (10 × 300 mm, AP Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 500 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 250 mm sorbitol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm EGTA at 4 °C.

Cytosol Fractionation with Ammonium Sulfate—Appropriate amounts of ammonium sulfate were serially added to rat liver cytosol to achieve 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80% saturation. At each step precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a Sorval SS34 rotor at 4 °C. The volume of supernatant was measured, and additional ammonium sulfate was added to achieve the next level of saturation. Pellets at each ammonium sulfate concentration were solubilized with a small volume of buffer H and supplemented with 1 μg/ml calpain inhibitor, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Insoluble aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a Sorval SS34 rotor at 4 °C. The cleared supernatants were dialyzed against buffer H. Isolation of Microsomes—Cells grown to 70–80% confluency on 10-cm dishes were washed once with PBS, scraped into PBS (5 ml/dish), pooled, and harvested at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in PBS (0.5 ml/dish) and centrifuged again at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in Buffer F (0.2 ml/dish), passed through a 22-gauge needle 20 times, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The post nuclear supernatant fraction was removed into siliconized microcentrifuge tubes, and microsomes were sedimented at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Harvested microsomes were washed twice with Buffer G (0.1 ml/dish), and the pellet was resuspended in Buffer G (30 μl/dish). Thirty microliters of microsomes was used for each in vitro vesicle-formation reaction (see “In Vitro Transport Vesicle-formation Assay”). Liposome Binding Assay—Liposomes were prepared from the majorminor mix lipid formulation as described by Matsuoka and Schekman (29Matsuoka K. Schekman R. Methods. 2000; 20: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For a mammalian COPII binding experiment, 15 μg of a liposome suspension was mixed with various combinations of hamster Sar1a (1.2 μg), Sec23A/24C (1.7 μg), and Sec13/31A (2.4 μg) in 75 μl of HKM buffer with or without 0.1 mm GMP-PNP. For a yeast COPII binding experiment, 1.1 μg of Sar1p, 1.5 μg of Sec23/24p, and 2.2 μg of Sec13/31p were used. After incubation for 25 min at 27 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted with 50 μl of HKM containing 2.5 m sucrose. An aliquot (110 μl) of this mixture was loaded into a polycarbonate centrifuge tube (Beckman catalog number 343775) and overlaid with 100 μl of HKM containing 0.75 m sucrose and 20 μl of HKM. The resulting step gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 20 min at RT. A sample (25 μl) was collected from the top of the tube. Proteins in the fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained by SYPRO Red, and visualized using a Typhoon 9400 image analyzer. Liposome Budding Assay—Detailed procedures for the liposome budding assay were described in Matsuoka and Schekman (29Matsuoka K. Schekman R. Methods. 2000; 20: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The liposomes contained 58 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 22 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, 3 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylserine, 1 mol % dioleoyl phosphatidic acid, 10 mol % PI, 2 mol % CDP-diacylglycerol, 3 mol % sphingomyelin, 8 mol % cholesterol. Budding reactions contained 8.4 μg of Sar1a, 9.5 μg of Sec23A/24C, and 10.3 μg of Sec13/31A in 100 μl in the presence of GDP or GMP-PNP. The COPII vesicle fractions were separated using a sucrose-density gradient. Microsome Binding Assay—About 25 μg of microsomes were mixed with various combinations of 0.4 μg of Sar1a, 0.42 μg of Sec23A/24C, 0.6 μg of Sec13/31A, 0.1 mm GMP-PNP, and 1× ATP regenerating system. After incubation at RT for 15 min, unless otherwise indicated 45 μl of the reaction mixture was layered on 150 μl of buffer G containing 0.3 m sucrose and centrifuged at 80,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 10 min at RT. The pellet was washed with 200 μl of buffer G, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Strips of membrane were probed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-His6 antibody and visualized by ECL plus. Where indicated microsomes were incubated with 1 m potassium acetate or 2.5 m urea in buffer G for 10 min and further washed in buffer G before the binding assay. In Vitro Transport Vesicle-formation Assay—Each reaction contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 250 mm sorbitol, 150 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, protease inhibitor mixture (1×), 25–50 μg of microsomes in a 100-μl final volume. Where indicated an ATP regenerating system (40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 1 mm ATP), 0.2 mm GTP, and cytosol or purified recombinant COPII proteins (1 μg of Sar1a, 1 μg of Sec23A/Sec24C, and 1 μg of Sec13/31A) were added. Reactions were preincubated on ice for 5 min, initiated at 25 °C, and terminated by transferring tubes to ice after 60 min. A 75-μl aliquot of the vesicle fraction (S14) was separated from the donor microsomal fraction (P14) by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The vesicles from the S14 were collected by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100 rotor for 20 min (P100). P14 and P100 fractions were solubilized with 60 and 16 μl of Buffer C, respectively, and supplemented with 15 and 4 μl of Buffer D, respectively. The resulting samples were heated at 42 °C for 15 min. Aliquots of P14 (15 μl; 20% of total) and P100 (20 μl; 75% of total) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting. GST Pull-down Assay—Sec23A/24C or Sec23A (5 μg) were incubated with 30 μg of GST fusion proteins in 100 μl of buffer BB containing 15 μl of prewashed GSHA beads (AP Biotech) and 10% lipid emulsion for 90 min at RT (30Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 282: 698-700Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Beads were washed three times with buffer BB containing 0.05% octyl glucoside, once with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), and then eluted in SDS sample buffer. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting—Antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-ribophorin I serum, 1/3,000; anti-p58 serum, 1/1,000; anti-APP C-terminal IgG, 1/2,000; anti-PS1 antibody, 1/20,000; anti-Sec23A antibody, 1/1,000; anti-Sec24C antibody, 1/1,000; anti-Sec13 antibody, 1/1,000; anti-Sec31A antibody, 1/1,000; protein A-horseradish peroxidase (1 mg/ml in PBS supplemented with 50% glycerol), 1/2,500; S35-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, 1/1,000. Membranes bound with primary antibodies were incubated with protein A-horseradish peroxidase for visualization using ECL plus (AP Biotech) or S35-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for quantitation using phosphorimaging (Typhoon 9400, AP Biotech). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-His6 antibody was diluted 1/500. Electron Microscopy—In vitro vesicle formation assays were performed as described above. Membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor for 25 min, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in buffer G for 30 min at 4 °C, and processed as described previously for conventional electron microscopy of thin sections (31Orci L. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1986; 46: 171-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Purified mammalian Sec23A/24C complex (Fig. 1A) migrated on a Superose 6 gel with an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kDa (Fig. 1B). Considering the molecular masses of the recombinant Sec23A and Sec24C deduced from the cDNAs (88.3 and 122.5 kDa, respectively), Sec23A/24C appeared to interact with the matrix, resulting in longer retention during the chromatography. Mammalian Sec13/31A (36.8 and 136.4 kDa, respectively) eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 500 kDa, and yeast Sec13/31p eluted as a 700-kDa species (Fig. 1B). The elongated structure of tetrameric yeast Sec13/31p likely caused anomalous behavior on gel filtration chromatography (32Lederkremer G.Z. Cheng Y. Petre B.M. Vogan E. Springer S. Schekman R. Walz T. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10704-10709Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This behavior was also observed for the mammalian Sec13/31A, which eluted earlier than predicted for a heterotetramer (346.4 kDa). To test whether the mammalian proteins preserved the signature interactions among COPII proteins that had been established with the yeast proteins, we performed a liposome flotation assay. GMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, increased hamster Sar1a binding to the synthetic liposomes relative to the GDP state (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, 8, and 9). The small increment may be due to the fact that hamster Sar1a has a slower GTP exchange rate than yeast Sar1p on major-minor liposomes (data not shown). Recruitment of mammalian Sec13/31A required Sar1a, GMP-PNP, and Sec23A/24C, consistent with the behavior of the yeast proteins. This strongly suggests that the recombinant mammalian proteins are functionally active and preserve interfaces for proper interactions between them (Fig. 1C) (33Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Next, we monitored the recruitment of the recombinant COPII proteins to microsomal membranes (Fig. 2). We took advantage of the fact that the recombinant Sec24C and Sec31A could be specifically recognized by an anti-His6 antibody. Sec24C was more efficiently recognized by the anti-His6 antibody than Sec31A for unknow"

We previously identified and characterized a novel Sec23p-interacting protein, p125, that is only expressed in mammals and exhibits sequence homology with phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1). In this study, we examined the localization and function of p125 in detail. By using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we found that p125 is principally localized in ER exit sites where COPII-coated vesicles are produced. Analyses of chimeric proteins comprising p125 and two other members of the mammalian PA-PLA1 family (PA-PLA1 and KIAA0725p) showed that, for localization to ER exit sites, the p125-specific N-terminal region is critical, and the putative lipase domain is interchangeable with KIAA0725p but not with PA-PLA1. RNA interference-mediated depletion of p125 affected the organization of ER exit sites. The structure of the cis-Golgi compartment was also substantially disturbed, whereas the medial-Golgi was not. Protein export from the ER occurred without a significant delay in p125-depleted cells. Our study suggests that p125 is a mammalian-specific component of ER exit sites and participates in the organization of this compartment.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), COPII-coated vesicles are produced at a specialized ER subdomain known as ER exit sites or the transitional ER. Recent studies involving living cells revealed that ER exit sites are immobile yet dynamic (13Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and are generated de novo (14Bevis B.J. Hammaond A.T. Reinke C.A. Glick B.S. Nat.

In mammalian cells, newly formed ER exit sites appear to move slowly from the cell periphery toward the perinuclear Golgi-proximal region (15Stephens D.J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Biochemical and live cell imaging studies have suggested that the COPII coat is replaced with the COPI coat in close proximity to ER exit sites (16Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 17Shima D.T. Scales S.J. Kreis T.E. Pepperkok R. Curr.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2250-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This replacement results in the formation of a membrane compartment named vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) or the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). These cargo-containing VTCs move in a COPI-dependent manner along microtubule tracks toward the cis-Golgi (21Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ER-resident proteins are segregated in VTCs and transported back to the ER by COPI-coated vesicles via the retrograde pathway (22Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Klumperman J. Cell. 1999; 98: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although the boundaries between the ER exit sites, VTCs, and cis-Golgi are not fully defined, several marker proteins have been reported for each compartment. COPII consists of two heterotrimeric complexes, Sec23p-Sec24p and Sec13p-Sec31p, and a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein Sar1p (5Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Activation of Sar1p on the ER membrane results in the sequential recruitment of the Sec23p-Sec24p complex and the Sec13p-Sec31p complex, which leads to vesicle budding (5Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T.

Concomitant with this budding process, cargo proteins are selectively incorporated into forming vesicles most likely through interaction with Sec24p (8Miller E. Antonny B. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 9Mossessova E. Bickford L.C. Goldberg J.

Cell. 2003; 114: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Sec23p exhibits a GAP activity toward Sar1p, and hydrolysis of GTP on Sar1p, perhaps occurring after vesicle fission, results in the depolymerization of the COPII coat, thereby leading to uncoating (23Yoshihisa T. Barlowe C. Scheckman R. Science. 1993; 259: 1466-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We identified previously and characterized a mammalian Sec23p-interacting protein, p125, that appears to be only expressed in mammals and exhibits a wide tissue expression distribution (24Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Mizoguchi T. Nakajima K. Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Hauri H.-P. Tagaya M. Tani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). p125 contains an N-terminal proline-rich region responsible for the interaction with Sec23p (25Mizoguchi T. Nakajima K. Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Hauri H.-P. Tagaya M. Tani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and central and C-terminal regions, which exhibit significant sequence homology to phospholipid-modifying proteins, especially PA-PLA1, which was identified by Higgs et al. (26Higgs H.N. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9574-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Higgs H.N. Han M.H. Johnson G.E. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5468-5477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A data base search led to the discovery of another p125-like protein, KIAA0725p, that shows 52.6% aa identity with p125 over the entire sequence but lacks the N-terminal, proline-rich Sec23p-interacting region (28Nakajima K. Sonoda H. Mizoguchi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Nagahama M. Tagaya M. Tani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11329-11335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It seems that PA-PLA1, p125, and KIAA0725p constitute a novel protein family, i.e. the PA-PLA1 family. Although the physiological implication of this family is poorly understood, members of this family may in general be involved in membrane transport or organelle maintenance. Recent work on an Arabidopsis mutant has demonstrated that SGR2p, a member of this family, is involved in gravity sensing, perhaps by mediating vacuole and/or vesicle transport to the vacuoles in endodermal cells (29Kato T. Morita M.T. Fukaki H. Yamauchi Y. Uehara M. Niihama M. Tasaka M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30Morita M.T. Kato T. Nagafusa K. Saito C. Ueda T. Nakano A. Tasaka M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Understanding of the function of this family may provide an insight into the relationships between lipid metabolism, signaling, and membrane transport. Although our previous studies involving an ectopic expression system contributed to the understanding of the role of p125 in the early secretory pathway (24Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Mizoguchi T. Nakajima K. Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Hauri H.-P. Tagaya M. Tani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), more direct approaches are necessary to define the exact localization and function of p125. In this study, we produced antibodies that specifically recognize endogenous p125, and we examined the effect of depletion of p125 on the localization of proteins within the early secretory pathway. Our results demonstrated that p125 is mainly localized in ER exit sites, where COPII-coated vesicles are produced, and contributes to the organization of this compartment. Antibodies—The cDNA fragment encoding aa 1–134 of p125 (p125N) was inserted into expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-p125N fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and then injected into rabbits according to the standard method. The antisera produced were first depleted of anti-GST antibodies by chromatography on a GST column, and then the anti-p125 antibody was affinity-purified using antigen-coupled beads. For the production of mAb, the purified protein was injected into BALB/c mice. Hybridoma cells producing antibodies against p125 were obtained according to the standard protocol. The monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascites using a HiTrap™ protein G HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-FLAG mAb (M2) and the polyclonal anti-GST antibody were obtained from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The polyclonal antibodies against Sec23p and mannosidase II were purchased from Affinity BioReagents and Chemicon International, respectively. The polyclonal antibodies against VSV-G, β-COP, and Sec31p were prepared in this laboratory. The monoclonal antibody against VSV-G (8G5) was prepared from ascites. The antibody against ribophorin II was kindly provided by Dr. D. Meyer (UCLA). Cell Culture—Cell culture was performed as described (24Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To examine p125-depleted HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (31Tagaya M. Furuno A. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by sequential incubation with primary antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and/or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed as described (32Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani T. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction and Transfection—cDNA clone AK058137 (Toyobo), which encodes aa 360–872 of human PA-PLA1, was cleaved with KpnI and XhoI, and the resultant fragment was inserted into pBluescript SK+. To obtain the upstream region of human PA-PLA1 cDNA, PCR was carried out using a human cDNA library (MATCHMAKER human leukocyte cDNA library, Clontech) as a template and synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-gcgggtaccgagaattcaagatctatgaattacccgggccgcgg and 5′-ggcggtaccactacttgatgctttag) as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The sense primer contained a KpnI site and nucleotide positions 1–20 of human PA-PLA1, the sequence of which was taken from the human genome sequence data base. The antisense primer contained nucleotides complementary to positions 69–91 of the AK058137 sequence, which includes a KpnI site. The amplified DNA fragment, comprising the putative initiation codon to the KpnI site of human PA-PLA1, was treated with KpnI and then inserted into the pBluescript-derived vector to generate the full-length cDNA of human PA-PLA1. Mammalian expression plasmid pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) was used to express proteins with an N-terminal FLAG epitope. The mammalian expression plasmids for FLAG-p125 and FLAG-KIAA0725p were described previously (24Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Mizoguchi T. Nakajima K. Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Hauri H.-P. Tagaya M. Tani K. Biochem. Biophys.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11329-11335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Chimeric protein constructs were produced by PCR and verified by DNA sequencing. Chimera A was composed of the N-terminal aa 1–234 of p125 fused to a KIAA0725p fragment starting from Ser-2. Chimera B was a fusion protein comprising the N-terminal aa 1–259 of p125 and the entire PA-PLA1. For the expression of proteins, Vero or 293T cells plated on 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1–2 μg of expression plasmids using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane Binding Assays—Recombinant Sar1 proteins were purified as described previously (33Rowe T. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Microsome membranes and rat liver cytosol were prepared as described previously (16Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Membrane binding of p125 was analyzed by using microsome membranes (20–40 μg) supplemented with recombinant Sar1 proteins and rat liver cytosol, as described for the analysis of Sec23 binding (35Aridor M.

Romero G. Aridor M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4059-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Construction of a HeLa Cell Line Expressing VSV-045G—A pcDNA3-based expression plasmid for VSV-045G, which encodes aa 1–511 of the VSV-045G protein with the C-terminal 4 aa (RTAA) followed by a T7 tag (MASMTGGQQMG), was constructed. The cDNA of VSV-045G was derived from pVSVG-GFP, which was a kind gift from Dr. J. Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health). HeLa cells were transfected with the expression plasmid for VSV-045G and then selected for stable expression with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Individual clones were cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 and screened for expression by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-VSVG mAb. We sought to obtain clones that stably express VSV-045G, but all clones obtained gradually lost the ability to express the protein while retaining resistance to the selection marker. In this study, we used cells moderately expressing VSV-045G. RNAi—The RNA duplexes used for targeting of p125 (aagttgaccatttggtgtttg) and lamin A/C (aactggacttccagaagaacatc) were purchased from Japan Bioservice, Inc. Transfection of HeLa cells was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The final concentration of an RNA duplex was 200 nm. At 48 or 72 h after transfection, the cells were processed for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. VSV-045G Transport Assays—HeLa cells stably expressing VSV-045G were transfected with or without a duplex RNA and then incubated for 48–55 h at 37 °C. The cells were further incubated at 40 °C (a total of 72 h after transfection) and then shifted to 32 °C to allow protein transport. After incubation for the indicated times, the cells were fixed and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, the cells were solubilized with 0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 ml/35-mm dish) and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. A portion of the lysate was digested with Endo H (New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. VSV-045G was visualized by immunoblotting with the polyclonal anti-VSV-G antibody, and the intensities of the immunostained bands were quantitated with NIH image software. p125 Is Localized in ER Exit Sites—In a previous study, we used an ectopic expression system to determine the localization of p125, because the antibody we produced against a p125 peptide was not suitable for immunofluorescence analysis (24Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When FLAG-tagged p125 was transiently expressed at low levels in cultured cells, it was found to be colocalized with ERGIC53, a well known marker protein for VTCs (37Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and β-COP, a subunit of COPI located in both VTCs and the cis-Golgi (38Oprins A. Duden R. Kreis T.E. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Until recently, ER exit sites, VTCs, and the cis-Golgi could not be fully discerned as distinct compartments because of the lack of marker proteins for ER exit sites. However, recent studies revealed that ER exit sites are distinct from VTCs and the cis-Golgi in that they are characterized by COPII components (13Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To determine whether p125 is located in ER exit sites, we prepared monoclonal antibodies against p125. As an antigen, we chose the N-terminal 134 aa of p125 because this region exhibits no significant sequence homology with KIAA0725p or PA-PLA1. As shown in Fig. 1A, a mAb against p125 named 1D4 specifically recognized a band of ∼125 kDa on immunoblots of lysates from 293T cells (lane 1), Vero cells (lane 2), and HeLa cells (lane 3). This antibody detected ectopically expressed FLAG-p125 (Fig. 1A, lane 7) but not FLAG-KIAA0725p (lane 8) or FLAG-PA-PLA1 (lane 9). The faint 125-kDa band detected in Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9, most likely represents endogenous p125. By using mAb 1D4, we investigated the localization of endogenous p125 in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, a vesicular staining pattern was observed throughout the cells but was concentrated in the perinuclear region (a, d, and g). Essentially the same staining pattern was observed with a polyclonal antibody (see Fig. 3B, b) that specifically recognizes p125 (data not shown). Double labeling with mAb 1D4 and a polyclonal antibody against Sec31p, a COPII component, showed that the two proteins were well colocalized (Fig. 1B, a–f). A similar colocalization pattern was observed for p125 and another COPII component Sec23p (Fig. 1B, g–i). On the other hand, p125-positive structures showed limited overlapping with β-COP-positive ones. In the perinuclear region, p125 staining was observed in concentrated dot-like structures (Fig. 1C, d), whereas β-COP staining revealed more closely connected ones (e). Next, we analyzed the localization of p125 at the ultrastructural level. As shown in Fig. 2, immunogold labeling of p125 was observed in regions between the ER and Golgi but not within the Golgi stacks including the cis-Golgi area. This immunolabeling pattern is similar to that observed for Sec31p (39Tang B.L. Zhang T. Low D.Y. Wong E.T. Horstmann H. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13597-13604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The localization of p125 in ER exit sites was confirmed in two ways. First, cells were treated with BFA. This reagent is known to inactivate Arf1, thereby leading to the dissociation of COPI from the Golgi, which is followed by redistribution of most Golgi membrane proteins to the ER (40Klausner R.D. Donaldon J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with BFA, β-COP staining changed from a perinuclear pattern to a diffuse, cytosolic one (Fig. 3A, e), whereas p125 retained the dot-like pattern (a and d) similar to Sec31p (b). Clearly, p125 was still colocalized with Sec31p in BFA-treated cells. Next, we examined the effect of expression of constitutive active Sar1p on p125 localization. Because uncoating of COPII-coated vesicles is regulated via the GTP/GDP cycle of Sar1p (23Yoshihisa T. Barlowe C. Scheckman R. Science. 1993; 259: 1466-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), expression of the constitutively active form (Sar1p[H79G]) prevents uncoating, which leads to the generation of vesicular tubular membrane clusters containing COPII components and cis-Golgi matrix proteins (19Ward T.H. Polishchuk R.S. Caplan S. Hirschberg K. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, p125 (b), similar to Sec31p (e), was observed in perinuclear clusters in FLAG-Sar1p[H79G]-expressing cells. These immunofluorescence and electron microscopic results taken together strongly suggest that p125 is primarily localized in ER exit sites rather than the cis-Golgi. p125 Is Recruited to Microsome Membranes in an Active Sar1p-dependent Manner—Given that p125 is present in Sar1p[H79G]-induced clusters containing a COPII component, we wondered whether p125 is recruited to membranes in an active Sar1p-dependent manner. To test this, we performed in vitro membrane binding assays (Fig. 4). Microsome membranes were incubated with rat liver cytosol and increasing concentrations of Sar1p[H79G] under conditions that support COPII assembly (35Aridor M. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35673-35676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 36Pathre P. Shome K. Blumental-Perry A. Bielli A. Haney C.J. Alber S. Watkins S.C. Romero G. Aridor M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4059-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubations, the membranes were washed and collected by centrifugation, and the binding of p125 to the membranes was assessed by immunoblotting with mAb 1D4. Activated Sar1p led to enhancement of p125 association with the membranes (Fig. 4A, compare lane 1 to lanes 2–5). A minor signal was observed when microsome membranes were omitted from the incubation, attesting to the specificity of membrane binding (Fig. 4A, lane 6). The enhancement of p125 interaction with microsome membranes was dependent on Sar1p activation. Incubation of microsome membranes with a Sar1p mutant that mimics the GDP-bound form (Sar1p[T39N]) did not support COPII recruitment (analyzed by the membrane binding of Sec23p), as reported previously (6Aridor M. Weissman J. Bannykh S. Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), nor did it enhance p125 interaction with microsome membranes (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 3 and 4). This biochemical result complements the morphological observation that p125 is redistributed to Sec31-enriched perinuclear clusters in cells which express constitutively active Sar1p. Overexpression of p125 Causes Perturbation of the Structures of ER Exit Sites, VTCs, and the cis-Golgi—Our previous study showed that expression of p125 at high levels in cells causes dispersion of β-COP and ERGIC53, whereas cis-Golgi matrix proteins such as p115 (41Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and GM130 (42Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G.

We examined whether the distribution of COPII changes upon ectopic expression of p125 (Fig. 5A). When expressed, FLAG-p125 was colocalized with Sec31p (Fig. 5A, a–c) and Sec23p (d–f), demonstrating that expressed FLAG-p125 retains the targeting ability. It should be noted that in cells expressing FLAG-p125 at high levels, Sec31p and Sec23p were not dispersed but rather colocalized with overex"

OPLL is a systemic high bone mass disease with a strong genetic background. To detect genes relevant to the pathogenesis of OPLL, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis of systematic gene expression profiles during the osteoblastic differentiation of ligament cells from OPLL patients (OPLL cells), patients with a disorder called ossification of yellow ligament (OYL), and non-OPLL controls together with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) after stimulating them with osteogenic differentiation medium (OS). Twenty-four genes were up-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation in OPLL cells. Zinc finger protein 145 (promyelotic leukemia zinc finger or PLZF) was one of the highly expressed genes during osteoblastic differentiation in all the cells examined. We investigated the roles of PLZF in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation of hMSCs and C2C12 cells. Small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing of PLZF resulted in a reduction in the expression of osteoblast-specific genes such as the alkaline phosphatase, collagen 1A1 (Col1a1), Runx2/core-binding factor 1 (Cbfa1), and osteocalcin genes, even in the presence of OS in hMSCs. The expression of PLZF was unaffected by the addition of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), and the expression of BMP-2 was not affected by PLZF in hMSCs. In C2C12 cells, overexpression of PLZF increased the expression of Cbfa1 and Col1a1; on the other hand, the overexpression of CBFA1 did not affect the expression of Plzf. These findings indicate that PLZF plays important roles in early osteoblastic differentiation as an upstream regulator of CBFA1 and thereby might participate in promoting the ossification of spinal ligament cells in OPLL patients.

Sakou T. Yonenobu K. Sakou T. Ono K. Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1997: 11-17Google Scholar). OPLL patients show ectopic bone formation in the posterior longitudinal ligament, which compresses the spinal cord leading to various neurological symptoms. Despite the late onset (average age of onset is 50 years), OPLL has a strong genetic background as shown in classical epidemiological studies and by an estimate of relative risk to siblings of ∼10 (2Terayama K.

Because genetic factors appear to play crucial roles in the etiology of OPLL, genetic screenings to identify susceptibility are important. To date, we have performed genetic linkage and linkage disequilibrium studies to identify the causalities of OPLL and have successfully identified collagen 11A2 (COL11A2) and collagen 6A1 (3Koga H.

We also demonstrated that an intron 6 (-4a) polymorphism of COL11A2 affects the splicing of exon 6 in ligament cells from OPLL patients (5Maeda S. Ishidou Y. Koga H. Taketomi E. Ikari K. Komiya S.

Although the identification of genetic factors of OPLL has important implications, the overall picture of the molecular pathogenesis is still unclear, mainly because a subtle biological effect of the variant is the only observation, and, therefore, the biological significance of the variant is still obscure. Accordingly, multiple approaches are needed to understand the etiology of OPLL. One such approach is to use a cDNA microarray technique to obtain a global view of gene expression during the osteoblastic differentiation of ligament cells from OPLL patients. Genes whose expression changed markedly during osteoblastic differentiation would play key roles in the pathogenesis of OPLL. Primary ligament cells from patients with OPLL or a related disorder, ossification of yellow ligament (OYL), and from non-OPLL controls together with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were treated with osteogenic differentiation medium (OS) to induce osteoblastic differentiation, and gene expression profiles during the differentiation were then monitored. Among the genes up-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation, we focused our attention on zinc finger protein 145, also known as the PLZF (promyelotic leukemia zinc finger) protein, to study the role of osteoblastic differentiation in hMSC and C2C12 cells, because PLZF is a zinc finger transcription factor that possibly regulates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) expression (7Barna M. Hawe N. Niswander L. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Bone formation is a complex process involving the proliferation and expansion of osteoprogenitors and/or pre-osteoblasts followed by osteoblastic differentiation, resulting in matrix maturation and mineralization. Major breakthroughs in the identification of factors involved in osteoblastic differentiation have been made in recent years, improving our understanding of the molecular basis of bone metabolism. Core-binding factor 1 (CBFA1/Runx2), a runt family polypeptide, has been shown to be a key regulator for osteoblastic differentiation (8Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar, 9Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M.

Recently, osterix was also identified as an essential factor of osteoblastic differentiation that acts downstream of CBFA1 (10Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). CBFA1 and osterix are important for modulating the expression of osteoblast-specific genes such as collagen 1A1 (COL1A1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN) genes during osteoblastic differentiation (8Ducy P.

On the other hand, Tob, a member of the family of antiproliferative proteins, acts inhibitory to osteoblastic differentiation by interacting with BMP/Smad signaling (12Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T.

Members of the transforming growth factor-β family, including BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7, induce osteoblastic differentiation through the up-regulation of CBFA1 expression (13Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 14Reddi A.H. Nat.

CBFA1 is necessary but not sufficient for osteogenesis, because the differentiation of C2C12 cells into mature osteoblasts cannot be induced by activation of CBFA1 (16Liu W. Toyosawa S. Furuichi T. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Himeno M. Narai S. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription factors other than CBFA1 are required to activate the genetic pathways controlling osteoblastic differentiation. PLZF, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that contains nine Kruppel-type zinc finger domains at the carboxyl terminus, was identified along with retinoic acid receptor-α as being involved in acute promyelocytic leukemia (17Chen Z.

We investigated the role of PLZF in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation in hMSCs and C2C12 cells. Chemicals and Antibodies—OS containing 0.1 μm dexamethasone, 0.05 mm ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate was purchased from Sigma. Human recombinant BMP-2 was purchased from Sigma, polyclonal anti-Runx-2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), the monoclonal anti-PLZF antibody was from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA), and the polyclonal anti-collagen I antibody was from the Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation. Cells and Cell Culture—hMSCs were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Primary ligament cells from patients were provided by the University of Yamaguchi and the University of Hirosaki with the approval of the institutional review boards of both institutes. Ligament tissues from the cervical spine were resected aseptically during surgical operation from OPLL, OYL, and non-OPLL (cervical spondylotic myelopathy) patients. The surrounding tissue was carefully removed under a dissecting microscope to extract the ossified lesion and avoid any possible contamination of osteogenic cells. The ligament tissues were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) several times, minced into 0.5-mm3 pieces, and then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic/antimycotic solution (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B) (Sigma). Cells from the explants were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotic/antimycotic solution. The cultured cells at 5-6 passages were used for the subsequent experiments. C2C12, a mouse pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line, was used for transient expression experiments. RT-PCR Method—Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed with the SuperScript one-step RT-PCR system and gene-specific primers according to the condition recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Reaction mixtures containing total RNA (500 ng of each), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.8 μm each primer, 2 units of enzyme mixture including SuperScript II RT, platinum Taq DNA polymerase, and 1× buffer with 1.2 mm MgSO4 were kept at 50 °C for 30 min and then at 94 °C for 2 min, and PCR was performed. The PCR profile was 30 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 1 min. The primers for RT-PCRs were designed based on human and mouse sequences in the GenBank™. These sequences are listed in the supplementary table that can be found in the on-line version of this article. Measurement of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by histochemical analysis using a staining kit from Sigma (catalog number 85L-3R). Briefly, cells were fixed with citrate-buffered acetone for 30 s, washed with deionized water for 45 s, and incubated with an alkaline-dye mixture for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The intensities of the signals were measured using NIH image version 1.62. Mineralization Assay—Mineralization of the extracellular matrix was evaluated by Alizarin Red S staining (Sigma). Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol at -20 °C for 1 h followed by several washes with deionized water. The cells were stained with Alizarin Red S (10 mg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature followed by incubation with PBS for 20 min according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA Microarray Analysis—Primary ligament cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence or absence of OS and harvested to investigate differences in gene regulation at an early stage of differentiation. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells with TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen) and verified by using an RNA 6000 Nano assay with an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Ten micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with cyanine 3-dCTP (Cy3) or cyanine 5-dCTP (Cy5) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Labeled probes were hybridized with an Agilent human 1 cDNA microarray kit (Agilent Technologies), which included 12,814 unique clones from Incyte UniGene 1 and human drug target clone sets. The microarray was scanned in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels with an Agilent DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). The raw data from the microarray assay were normalized according to the manufacturer's guidelines using Feature Extraction software from Agilent Technologies. The ratio of normalized intensity ≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5 was used to generate a list of genes with significant changes in expression during osteoblastic differentiation. Expression profile data were evaluated in duplicate experiments. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% skim milk to block nonspecific protein binding and then incubated at 4 °C for 8 h with the primary antibody. Following four washes with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antibody binding was visualized with an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Indirect Immunofluorescent Cell Staining—Cells (1 × 104) cultured on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were treated with 3% skim milk in PBS for 30 min and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 3% skim milk. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 20 min with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 3% skim milk. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and immunolocalization was examined with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). RNA Interference—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were synthesized using the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) (23Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). The siRNA used in this study consisted of a 21-nucleotide sense strand and a 21-nucleotide antisense strand with a two-nucleotide overhang at the 3′-end. The sequences were as follows: PLZF-siRNA (1Matsunaga S. Sakou T. Yonenobu K. Sakou T. Ono K. Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament.

At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were analyzed with RT-PCR or immunofluorescent microscopy. Transient Transfections—C2C12 cells were cultured on a 6-cm diameter dish at 40% confluency and transiently transfected with 3.0 μg of the pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene) containing PLZF or PLZFΔBTB cDNA. The expression vectors bearing full-length PLZF and PLZFΔBTB cDNA clones were generously provided by Dr. Jonathan Licht (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Forty-eight hours after transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), the cells were harvested and subjected to RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Morphology and ALP Activity of Ligament Cells from OPLL, OYL, and Non-OPLL Patients in OS—Explant cells of minced ligament tissues from OPLL, OYL, and non-OPLL patients were cultured and treated with OS. After treatment with OS for 9 days, morphological change from a spindle to cuboidal shape was observed for all of the cells with no distinct differences (Fig. 1A). A systemic hyperostosis is believed to underlie the pathogenesis of OPLL and OYL (1Matsunaga S. Sakou T. Yonenobu K. Sakou T. Ono K. Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1997: 11-17Google Scholar). Consequently, explant cells from non-ossified ligaments of OPLL, OYL, and non-OPLL patients were examined for ALP activity after OS treatment. OPLL and OYL cells showed dramatically increased levels of ALP activity after treatment with OS for 9 days, whereas ALP activity was only slightly increased in non-OPLL cells (Fig. 1, B and C). These results demonstrate that OPLL and OYL cells have a tendency to differentiate into osteoblastic lineage cells as compared with non-OPLL cells. cDNA Microarray Analysis of OPLL, OYL, and Non-OPLL Cells after OS Treatment—The temporal pattern of gene expression during osteoblastic differentiation at an early stage (48 h post-OS treatment) was examined with a cDNA microarray that covers 12,814 distinct cDNA sequences of human genes. A total of ∼3000 genes were observed with positive signals in undifferentiated primary cells. As shown in Table I, 24 genes were up-regulated >2-fold in OPLL cells during osteoblastic differentiation. Twenty-four genes for OYL cells and 33 genes for non-OPLL control cells were up-regulated. Twenty genes, including those for metallothionein, αB-crystallin, and adrenomedullin were up-regulated >2-fold in OPLL in all the cells. Thirty-two genes were down-regulated during osteoblastic differentiation (Table II). Several genes, such as trinucleotide repeat containing 3, tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 6 (TSG-6), the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α subunit, and the P311 protein were down-regulated in all of the cells. Among them, TSG-6 expression after OS treatment decreased 0.25-fold for OPLL cells, 0.33-fold in OYL cells, and 0.48-fold in non-OPLL cells. The suppressive effect of TSG-6 on osteoblastic differentiation was further investigated in a separate study.Table IGenes regulated during osteoblastic differentiation of OPLL, OYL, and control cells by DNA microarray analysisGene nameAccession no.OPLL cellsaValues represent fold increase of up-regulated gene after 48 h of OS induction.OYL cellsaValues represent fold increase of up-regulated gene after 48 h of OS induction.Control cellsaValues represent fold increase of up-regulated gene after 48 h of OS induction.Zinc finger protein 145bKruppel-like; expressed in promyelocytic leukemia.AF06056811.510.14.7RAN-binding protein 2D420636.210.75.0Fibroblast growth factor 7cKeratinocyte growth factor.AI0753384.83.42.2Human metallothionein-II pseudogene (mt-IIps)J002724.25.05.4Crystallin, αBS456303.94.04.1Metallothionein 1GJ039103.55.85.7Activated leucocyte cell adhesion moleculeAA7771573.03.52.3Collagen, type VIII, α1NM_0018503.32.15.0Matrix Gla proteinAW9976813.15.34.6Metallothionein 1BR992073.14.54.5Glutaredoxin (thioltransferase)X766482.13.12.2Homo sapiens cDNAdFLJ21675 fis, clone COL09372.AK025338NDeNot determined.3.11.8Metallothionein 1LX972613.04.04.4RNA helicase-related proteinAI8144482.9NDeNot determined.NDeNot determined.Cardiac ankyrin repeat proteinX837032.83.24.2Dual specificity phosphatase IX682772.52.63.7TransgelinM957871.72.52.2Sequence 12 from Patent WO9954460AX0136902.42.72.7Growth arrest-specific IL136982.42.52.1Metallothionein 1E (functional)H725322.34.8NDeNot determined.KIAA0851 proteinAB0206582.2NDeNot determined.NDeNot determined.MADS box transcription enhancer factor 2fPolypeptide D.L167942.11.82.9AdrenomedullinS739062.12.52.9Collagen, type XI, α1J041772.12.13.8Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipperBE2958171.42.12.3Laminin, α2gMerosin, congenital, muscular dystrophy.M598321.92.12.4Integrin, α5hFibronectin receptor, α-polypeptide.NM_0022052.02.93.9Human destrin-2 pseudogene mRNAiComplete coding sequence.U725182.0NDeNot determined.2.0a Values represent fold increase of up-regulated gene after 48 h of OS induction.b Kruppel-like; expressed in promyelocytic leukemia.c Keratinocyte growth factor.d FLJ21675 fis, clone COL09372.e Not determined.f Polypeptide D.g Merosin, congenital, muscular dystrophy.h Fibronectin receptor, α-polypeptide.i Complete coding sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2143554526,"The cytoskeletal protein talin binds to a short C-terminal sequence in phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Iγ (PIPKIγ), activating the enzyme and promoting the local production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate, which regulates focal adhesion dynamics as well as clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neuronal cells. Here we show by crystallographic, NMR, and calorimetric analysis that the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)-like domain of talin engages the PIPKIγ C terminus in a mode very similar to that of integrin binding. However, PIPKIγ binds in the canonical PTB-peptide mode with an SPLH motif replacing the classic NPXY motif. The tighter packing of the SPLH motif against the hydrophobic core of talin may explain the stronger binding of PIPKIγ. Two tyrosine residues flanking the SPLH motif (Tyr-644 and Tyr-649) have been implicated in the regulation of talin binding. We show that phosphorylation at Tyr-644, a Src phosphorylation site in vivo, has little effect on the binding mode or strength, which is consistent with modeling studies in which the phosphotyrosine makes surface-exposed salt bridges, and we suggest that its strong activating effect arises from the release of autoinhibitory restraints in the full-length PIPKIγ. Modeling studies suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-649 will likewise have little effect on talin binding, whereas phosphorylation of the SPLH serine is predicted to be strongly disruptive. Our data are consistent with the proposal that Src activity promotes a switch from integrin binding to PIPKIγ binding that regulates focal adhesion turnover.

Our data are consistent with the proposal that Src activity promotes a switch from integrin binding to PIPKIγ binding that regulates focal adhesion turnover. The integrin family of cell adhesion molecules provide a mechanical link between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton and form the nuclei of structural and signaling complexes that regulate cell migration, proliferation, and survival, typically in concert with receptors for soluble ligands (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6892) Google Scholar, 2DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Integrins are initially activated by intracellular (“inside-out”) signals; following ligation to the extracellular matrix, “outside-in” signals lead to reorganization of the cytoskeleton and activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways. Until recently, rather little was known about the membrane-proximal events involved in integrin activation and signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for the cytoskeletal protein talin, which binds to the integrin β subunit cytoplasmic tail, disrupting αβ tail association and promoting a conformational change in the extracellular domains that leads to enhanced affinity for extracellular matrix proteins and the subsequent clustering of integrins on the cell surface (3Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M.

Hu B. Haas T. Plow E.F. Qin J. Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For outside-in signaling, a critical role has been revealed for Src, which binds constitutively to the C terminus of the integrin β-tail and is activated by intermolecular phosphorylation upon integrin clustering (6Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The interplay between inside-out and outside-in signaling is less well understood. Recent evidence points to a prominent role for the enzyme phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Iγ (PIPKIγ), 1The abbreviations used are: PIPKIγ, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Iγ; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding. which forms complexes with both Src and talin at focal adhesions (7Di Paolo G.

Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). PIPKIγ synthesizes the lipid phosphati-dylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate, a key activator of proteins involved in focal adhesion assembly, including talin. For example, phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate binding to talin relieves an autoinhibitory head-tail association that allows the talin FERM domain to bind and activate integrin (10Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In an example of positive feedback, the binding of talin to PIPKIγ also activates the kinase. However, the binding sites on talin for integrin and PIPKIγ overlap, which may limit this feedback loop (11Barsukov I.L. Prescot A. Bate N. Patel B. Floyd D.N. Bhanji N. Bagshaw C.R. Letinic K.

It has recently been shown that Src activates PIPKIγ by phosphorylating its C-terminal tail, enhancing its binding to talin (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). By contrast, Src phosphorylation of the integrin tail reduces its affinity for talin, and it has been proposed that Src triggers a switch between talin binding to integrin and PIPKIγ that may also control focal adhesion assembly (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We showed previously by crystallographic and NMR analysis that the F3 subdomain of talin engages integrin in a variant of a canonical PTB-peptide interaction (3Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The integrin sequence differs from typical PTB-NPXY interactions in that one or two extra residues are inserted between the NPXY “reverse turn” and the upstream β-strand, and a critical tryptophan residue located four residues upstream of the NPXY motif inserts into a deep pocket on the talin surface. The talin F3 subdomain also engages a C-terminal extension of PIPKIγ that is unique to this isoform and involves a WVSPLHY motif (7Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 8Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Based on comparison of the sequences of F3-binding motifs, we proposed that PIPKIγ would engage the talin F3 domain in a similar fashion to that of integrin (12Liddington R.C. Bankston L.A. de Pereda J.M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R94-R95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and recent evidence has lent support to this hypothesis (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Barsukov I.L. Prescot A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31202-31209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we show by direct crystallographic studies, solution-based NMR spectroscopy, and calorimetry that the binding of PIPKIγ to talin does indeed conform to a canonical PTB-peptide interaction. However, this interaction involves a novel reverse-turn SPLH motif that is immune to the Src regulation observed for the integrin NPXY motif, enabling the activity of Src to provide a switch between integrin and talin binding that may regulate focal adhesion turnover. Protein Purification and Crystallization—The cDNA sequence corresponding to residues 638-651 of murine PIPKIγ fused to residues 209-410 of mouse talin was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET15b bacterial expression vector using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The absence of errors in the sequence was corroborated by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into an Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain for protein expression. Cells were grown in “terrific broth” medium at 37 °C, and protein expression was carried out at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were frozen at -80 °C. Upon thawing, cell lysis was completed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The chimeric protein was purified using a nickel chelating affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). The His tag was subsequently cleaved with thrombin and removed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Protein was concentrated in an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Crystallography—Crystals were grown at 4 °C with sitting drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein at 13 mg/ml with a solution containing 0.1 m sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 6.2) and 35% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and equilibrating against a reservoir of the same solution. Crystals were directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection, with the mother liquor acting as cryoprotectant. Data were collected at 100 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 1.5 using a Quantum-4R charge-coupled device detector. Data were indexed with DENZO and reduced with SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) (Table I). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the algorithm PHASER (14Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), which found six copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit arranged in three pairs of two molecules related by 2-fold non-crystallographic rotation axes nearly parallel to the crystallographic symmetry axes. This quasi-symmetric arrangement of molecules gave rise to an intensity distribution that (erroneously) suggested the presence of merohedral twinning. Refinement was performed by simulated annealing and energy minimization in CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar). Given the unusual non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS), the Rfree set was chosen to obey P622 symmetry in order to minimize the risk of bias. Electron density corresponding to the PIPKIγ sequence was evident in the first maps, and a model was built for all six copies. The six amino acid differences between chicken and mouse sequences (all in the F2 domain) were also incorporated. Initially, strong (weight of 300 kcal/mol · Å2 for positional NCS and σB of 5 for B-factors) 6-fold NCS restraints were applied to three separate groups as follows: (i) residues 642-648 of PIPKIγ; (ii) residues 649-651 of PIPKIγ and 209-309 of talin; and (iii) residues 310-369 and 379-400 of talin. The weight for positional NCS restraints was gradually relaxed to reach 5 kcal/mol · Å2 in the last cycle of refinement. The final model (Rwork = 25.3; Rfree = 28.6) consists of residues 642-651 of PIPKIγ and 209-400 of talin. The positional root mean square deviation between Cα atoms in different molecules ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 Å. Residues 209-400 of chain A superpose with the corresponding residues in the talin/integrin β3 (Protein Data Bank code 1MIZ) with root mean square deviation (Cα) of 1 Å.

Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification for NMR—For NMR experiments, the F3 domain (residues 309-405) of C336S mutant mouse talin were subcloned into a pGEX-6P-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The C336S substitution in talin F3 has no effect on integrin β-tail binding (18Ulmer T.S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8307-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL-21. 15N-Labeled protein was expressed in M9 minimal media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing lysozyme (1 mg/ml), MgSO4 (10 mm), and DNase I from Sigma (20 μg/ml). Cells were lysed by freeze/thaw cycles before adding Triton X-100 (Roche Applied Science) to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) and centrifuging. The supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and purified according to the product manual. Glutathione S-transferase fusion protease 3Cpro was added to cleave the fusion protein overnight at 4 °C (19Cordingley M.G. Callahan P.L. Sardana V.V. Garsky V.M. Colonno R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9062-9065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the talin F3 domain was purified away from the glutathione S-transferase and protease by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The identity and purity of the final protein was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. The PIPKIγ peptides PTDERSWVYSPLHYSAR and PTDERSWVYSPLHYSAR (phosphotyrosine is in boldfaced type) and the β-integrin peptide RAKWDTANNPLYKE were purchased from Alta Bioscience (Birmingham, UK) and further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Experiments were conducted using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The cell contained 1.4 ml of ∼30 μm talin F3 domain, and the syringe held a solution of the peptide at a concentration 18 times that of the protein. Accurate concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficients 16,500 m-1 cm-1 for talin F3 and 8250 m-1 cm-1 for the PIPKIγ peptides. All solutions were in 10 mm phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, and 137 mm NaCl at pH 7.4. Solutions were degassed at 15 °C for 20 min prior to the experiment. Experiments were conducted at 25 °C and consisted of a preliminary 2-μl injection followed by 20-24 injections of 5 μl with intervals of 210 s. Samples were injected at a rate of 0.5 μl/min. Stirring of the cell solution was carried out at 310 rpm. The heat of dilution values were calculated by injecting peptide solutions into the buffer alone. The average heat of dilution was then subtracted from the main experiment. Data analysis was carried out with MicroCal Origin software using a single binding site model. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on spectrometers built in-house at the Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences. Spectrometers were equipped with Oxford Instruments superconducting magnets (500, 600, and 750 MHz 1H operating frequencies) and GE/Omega computers. The talin F3 domain was assigned using a sample of 0.9 mm U-15N-labeled F3 in 95% H2O, 5% D2O and one of 1.5 mm U-15N-labeled F3 in 99.9% D2O. All samples were buffered with 50 mm phosphate, pH 6.1, and contained 100 mm NaCl. Three-dimensional gradient-enhanced 1H-15N total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY)-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) (70-ms mixing time) and 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)-HSQC (125 ms mixing time) spectra were acquired on the water sample (20Marion D.

Two-dimensional spectra that were acquired on the D2O sample were a 1H-1H-TOCSY with a 70-ms mixing time (21Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), 1H-1H double quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) (22Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). Data processing was achieved using the FELIX 2.3 software package (Biosym Technologies Inc.), and spectra were assigned using the program SPARKY (www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky). Spectra were referenced to an external DSS sample at 0 ppm (1H), with indirect referencing in the 15N dimension using a 15N-1H frequency ratio of 0.101329118 (24Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). For the peptide binding studies two samples were used per titration, each containing 100 μm U-15N-labeled F3, with the second sample also containing the maximal concentration of the peptide under study. Intermediate peptide concentrations were then obtained by adding the appropriate volume of the peptide/protein stock solution to the sample of talin F3 alone. Two-dimensional gradient-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra (25Kay L.E. Kiefer R. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) with water flip-back (26Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) were acquired at each titration point. The concentrations of the PIPKIγ peptides, which bound in slow exchange, were 0, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 1000 μm. For the segment of the β-integrin tail that was in fast exchange, the concentrations were 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 3, 4.5, 6.5, 9, and 14 mm, and in this case saturation was not achieved. Deletion analysis defined a minimal binding motif on the PIPKIγ tail to the heptapeptide, WVYSPLH, which binds to the F3 subdomain of talin (7Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R.

For crystallographic studies we engineered a chimeric molecule that takes advantage of a fortuitous intermolecular contact as described previously for the talin-integrin complex (3Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The chimera comprises residues 638-651 (DERSWVYSPLHYSA) of PIPKIγ fused to residues 209-410 of murine talin (the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains). The chimeric protein yielded crystals that diffract to a 2.6-Å resolution, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement. The asymmetric unit contains six molecules arranged as three dimers in which the PIPKIγ arms are exchanged pair-wise. The talin-PIPKIγ interaction is essentially identical in the six crystallographically independent copies. Talin F3 contains two antiparallel β-sheets that form a β-sandwich with a single helix at the C terminus packing at the edge of the sandwich (Fig. 1). PIPKIγ residues 642-644 (WVY) augment the β5-β6-β7 sheet by creating an additional strand at the β5 end of the sheet, where it packs against the α-helix. The main chain conformation and location of the tripeptide closely overlap with those of integrin (Fig. 1B). As for integrin, the tryptophan (Trp-642) is buried in a deep pocket created by residues from three strands of the β5-β6-β7 sheet, namely Tyr-377 (β7), Asp-369 (β6), and Arg-358 (β5), consistent with a critical role for the tryptophan in binding (7Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The side chain of Val-643 packs against Trp-359 in the hydrophobic core of the β-sandwich. The aromatic ring of Tyr-644 packs against Arg-358 on the outer edge of the complex, with its hydroxyl group making an H-bond to the Arg-358 guanidinium group (Fig. 1C). PIPKIγ residues 645-648 (SPLH) form a reverse turn analogous to the classic NPXY turn in which Ser-645 plays the same role as the asparagine, forming an N-cap to the turn by making a H-bond to the main chain N of Leu-647, whereas its C=O group makes a 310 helix H-bond to His-648. The side chain of Leu-647 makes a leucine zipper-like contact by inserting its side chain into a pocket created by three aliphatic residues at the end of the C-terminal helix; in the talin-integrin complex no such contact is possible because of a 60° tilt of the NPLY motif. The His side chain sits in the pocket occupied by the NPLY tyrosine in the talin-integrin complex, lying flat against the protein surface and forming an H-bond between its side chain Nϵ2 and Thr-354 C=O. The tyrosine downstream of the SPLH motif, Tyr-649, lies flat against the outside of the reverse turn. We assigned the backbone resonances of the isolated F3 domain in solution by NMR (see “Experimental Procedures”) and studied the chemical shift perturbations upon binding the PIPKIγ peptide PTDERSWVYSPLHYSAR, as well as the β3 integrin binding peptide RAKWDTANNPLYKE (Fig. 2). The NMR perturbation data are consistent with the crystallographic data, showing that the chimeric crystal structure is a reliable model for the complex in solution. The residues perturbed by PIPKIγ binding are the same as those perturbed by β-integrin peptide binding. The NMR data indicate that the PIPKIγ peptide binds tighter than integrin peptide, as evidenced by generally larger shift perturbations and a slow (separate signals) exchange regime for the PIPKIγ peptide as compared with the fast exchange regime observed for the integrin peptide (Fig. 2D). The NMR data provide further insights into the conformational changes induced by ligand binding. The major perturbations are to the β5-β6-β7 sheet and the C-terminal helix (Fig. 2E). As expected, strand β5, which forms the main chain β-sheet contacts, is the region most affected by binding. Surprisingly, the whole of the β6-β7 loop is strongly perturbed; at its tip, this loop contacts the Tyr/His of the NPLY/SPLH motif. In previously determined crystal structures of talin lacking a ligand with a reverse turn motif, the β6-β7 loop adopts a conformation in which a tyrosine from this loop (Tyr-373) packs against the body of the domain. In the talin-integrin complex, the loop changes its conformation such that the Phe-370 phenyl ring packs more deeply into its hydrophobic pocket and the Tyr-373 Cα shifts7Åasits phenol ring flips by 180° to become exposed on the protein surface. This switch appears to be driven by the packing of the NPXY tyrosine into its pocket. In the talin-PIPKIγ crystal structure, the histidine projects less far into its pocket, and both conformations are observed in different copies of the asymmetric unit. The biological significance of this conformational switch remains to be defined; although Tyr-373 is not part of a known kinase recognition motif, it is predicted with high confidence to be a phosphorylation site according to the NetPhos method (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/). We next studied the NMR chemical shift perturbations of a phosphorylated PIPKIγ peptide, PTDERSWVYSPLHYSAR (phosphotyrosine is boldfaced), corresponding to the site identified as a site of Src kinase modification (Tyr-644). The NMR perturbations are very similar to those for the non-phosphorylated peptide, indicating that the binding mode and strength are very similar (Fig. 2, B and C). In general, the shifts are a little higher for the phosphorylated peptide, suggesting either somewhat stronger binding or a direct effect of the phosphate group on the amide resonances. We measured the binding of these two peptides to talin F3 in solution using isothermal titration calorimetry. We found that the dissociation constant for the phosphorylated peptide (pH 7.4) was lower than that for the unphosphorylated peptide (Kd = 170 ± 5 nmversus 271 ± 0.6 nm) (see the supplementary data in the on-line version of this article), but the difference is less than that observed in previous studies using fluorescein-labeled peptide (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Some of the observed differences may result from the use here of isolated F3 rather than the intact FERM domain used by Ling et al. (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Modeling (not shown) of the phosphotyrosine onto the crystal structure shows that rotation of the tyrosine about its Cα-Cβ bond generates favorable ionic contacts between the phosphate group and the side chain of both Arg-358 and Lys-357 without disrupting the main chain contacts with the β5 strand. Modeling of the second tyrosine (Tyr-649) in its phosphorylated form also shows that a favorable contact with the Lys-357 side chain can be made. Our structural model of the talin-PIPKIγ interaction reveals a novel variant of the PTB-peptide interaction in which an SPLH motif replaces the classical NPXY motif. We show directly that the binding sites for integrin and PIPKIγ on talin are essentially identical and, thus, mutually exclusive. The stronger binding of PIPKIγ may be explained by the tighter packing of the SPLH motif against the hydrophobic core of the F3 domain than that observed for integrin, where a two-residue insertion between the β-strand and reverse turn creates a bulge filled by a water molecule. A 60° tilt of the integrin NPLY motif allows the tyrosine to fit into its pocket, but this prevents the leucine from packing against the hydrophobic core of F3. The binding mode for PIPKIγ demonstrates that the talin F3 domain can indeed bind peptides in the “canonical” mode, and increases the likelihood that the protein layilin (27Borowsky M.L. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which has two talin binding sequences (WVENEIY and FVTNDIY), will bind talin in the same fashion. Previous studies have indicated that phosphorylation of the tyrosine preceding the SPLH motif by Src enhances binding to talin (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Using fluorescein-labeled peptides, Ling et al. (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) showed by fluorescence anisotropy that phosphorylation at either or both of the tyrosines in the WVYSPLHY motif increased binding to the talin FERM domain by ∼ 10-fold. Our NMR and calorimetric data, generated with unmodified peptide and the F3 domain, also indicate a positive, although more modest (∼2-fold), effect on binding to talin. Our structural model is consistent with these results, because the use of the SPLH motif places the two flanking tyrosine side chains (Tyr-644 and Tyr-649) in surface-exposed locations appropriately placed to make favorable ionic interactions with exposed basic residues. Surface-exposed salt bridges generally have a much smaller energetic consequence than buried charge-charge interactions (such as those found in classic PTB-phosphopeptide interactions), because exposed groups must compete with water of solvation (28Xu D. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 999-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). By contrast, it has been shown that phosphorylation of the NPXY motif on integrin leads to loss of talin binding (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar); this finding is consistent with our model of the talin-integrin complex, because the tyrosine side chain fits into a hydrophobic and acidic pocket on the protein surface. Thus, our data support the proposal by Ling et al. (9Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that Src phosphorylation of integrin and PIPKIγ promotes a switch from integrin binding to PIPKIγ binding by talin. That is, by substituting an SPLH motif for an NPXY motif, PIPKIγ avoids modification by the Src kinase that would inhibit talin binding. The observation that talin binding to PIPKIγ activates the latter suggests that the talin binding motif is involved in autoinhibitory interactions in unactivated PIPKIγ, which could plausibly be relieved by phosphorylation and provide an alternative rationale for the strong activating effect of Src. Recent data have indicated that the SPLH serine is a target of MEK phosphorylation, which abolishes the PIPKIγ-talin interaction. 2P. De Camilli, personal communication. Because this serine is buried in our complex and forms an H-bond that stabilizes the SPLH reverse turn, phosphorylation at this site is strongly predicted to disrupt binding.

Studies were carried out to characterize changes in the apoptotic signaling cascade(s) culminating in luteal tissue apoptosis during PGF2α-induced luteolysis in the bovine species in which initiation of apoptosis was demonstrable at 18 h after exogenous PGF2α treatment. An analysis of intrinsic arm of apoptotic signaling cascade elements revealed that PGF2α injection triggered increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in the luteal tissue as early as 4 h posttreatment that remained elevated until 18 h. This increase was associated with the elevation in the active caspase-9 and -3 protein levels and activity (p < 0.05) at 4–12 h, but a spurt in the activity was seen only at 18 h posttreatment that could not be accounted for by the changes in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio or changes in translocation of Bax to mitochondria. Examination of luteal tissue for FasL/Fas death receptor cascade revealed increased expression of FasL and Fas at 18 h accompanied by a significant (p < 0.05) induction in the caspase-8 activity and truncated Bid levels. Furthermore, intrabursal administration of specific caspase inhibitors, downstream to the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling cascades, in a pseudopregnant rat model revealed a greater importance of extrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade in mediating luteal tissue apoptosis during PGF2α treatment. The DNase responsible for PGF2α-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation was found to be Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent, temperature-sensitive DNase, and optimally active at neutral pH conditions. This putative DNase was inhibited by the recombinant inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, and immunodepletion of caspase-activated DNase from luteal lysates abolished the observed DNA fragmentation activity.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism orchestrated by the genome-encoded proteins of the host that form part of two distinct (intrinsic and extrinsic) signaling cascades. The intrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade is generally thought to be activated by apoptotic stimuli that originate within a cell in response to certain drugs, radiation, or growth factor withdrawal and primarily cause changes in mitochondrial permeability through alterations in the ratio of pro-apoptotic to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (11Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the extrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade is activated by extracellular signals (viz. FasL) that interact with cell surface receptors (viz. Fas) to induce cell death (12Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Changes in the mitochondrial permeability or death receptor activation lead to activation of a cascade of intracellular proteases known as caspases (13Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Once activated, caspases cleave various cellular substrates including actin, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), DFF45/inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), fodrin, and lamin that contribute to the morphological changes seen in apoptotic cells (13Martin S.J.

It is mediated by the internucleosomal cleavage of DNA by endonucleases resulting in the formation of a 180-bp DNA ladder, which is considered as one of the hallmarks of cellular apoptosis. Candidates for such endonucleases include the caspase-activated enzymes, such as DFF40/caspase-activated DNase (CAD) (14Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

Recently, however, another DNase, endonuclease G, released from mitochondria during apoptosis has also been shown to mediate apoptotic DNA fragmentation (22Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Unlike the classical cell surface receptors that induce cell death, PGF2α receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that lacks any intracytoplasmic region with an identity/similarity to the death domain/caspase activation and recruitment domain that recruits and/or activates caspases. However, caspase-8, one of the initiator caspases acting downstream of the Fas receptor pathway, has recently been reported to be activated during PGF2α-induced luteal tissue apoptosis in the corpus luteum of murine species (23Carambula S.F. Pru J.K. Lynch M.P. Matikainen T. Goncalves P.B. Flavell R.A. Tilly J.L. Rueda B.R. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the authors hypothesized that some level of cross-talk exists between PGF2α receptor signal transduction and the classical apoptotic signaling cascades. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the observation that increased Bax and Fas expressions have been reported to be associated with the apoptosis in spontaneously regressing luteal tissue of the non-fertile cycles, whereas a significant attenuation in expression in these genes are seen in the corpus luteum during fertile cycle in the bovine species (24Rueda B.R.

Endocrinol. 1997; 14: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that activate classical apoptotic signaling cascades are capable of inducing apoptosis in the luteal cells. The final phase of cellular demise, i.e. fragmentation of DNA, is very well characterized in the luteal tissue and is frequently used as an index of structural luteal regression. However, the nature of the DNase that executes DNA fragmentation during PGF2α-induced apoptosis in the luteal tissue has not been identified, although several DNase-like activities, viz. Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent DNase (29Zeleznik A.J. Ihrig L.L. Bassett S.G. Endocrinology. 1989; 25: 2218-2220Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Zn2+-inhibitable DNase (6Rueda B.R. Wegner J.A. Marion S.L. Wahlen D.D. Hoyer P.B. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and DNase I-like enzymes (30Boone D.L. Yan W. Tsang B.K. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), have been observed to be active in the luteal cells under different conditions. These studies indicate that elements of apoptotic signaling cascades are present in the luteal cells, but the sequence of events that commit luteal cells to apoptosis in response to PGF2α remains to be determined. The purpose of this study was to systematically analyze the involvement of classical apoptotic signaling cascades during PGF2α-mediated apoptotic cell death in the corpus luteum. Moreover, the biochemical nature of the endonuclease responsible for apoptotic DNA fragmentation in the corpus luteum in response to PGF2α has not been previously studied and represents the major focus of our investigation. We chose to study these pathways in the corpus luteum of buffalo cows (Bubalus bubalis), because the characterization of apoptosis following spontaneous or PGF2α-induced luteolysis in this species was reported recently (7Yadav V.K. Sudhagar R.R. Medhamurthy R. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our results show for the first time that PGF2α-mediated apoptosis in the corpus luteum involves the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling cascade that precedes the activation of FasL/Fas cascade during PGF2α-induced apoptotic cell death in the bovine corpus luteum. A pseudopregnant rat model was standardized to investigate the relative roles of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling cascades in PGF2α-induced luteal tissue apoptosis. Using the pseudopregnant rat model, we demonstrate that intrabursal injection of a peptide-based cell-permeable caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk) prior to PGF2α injection abolished the caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation during PGF2α-induced luteal tissue apoptosis, whereas intrabursal injection of caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-fmk) only attenuated the apoptosis. Moreover, our results point to an important role played by CAD in mediating apoptotic DNA fragmentation during PGF2α-induced luteolysis.

PGF2α-induced Luteal Tissue Apoptosis in the Buffalo Cows (B. bubalis)—All of the procedures in animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (Indian Institute of Science). Buffalo cows (B. bubalis) on day 11 of the estrous cycle were injected intramuscular with 750 μg of Tiaprost (Iliren®, Intervet International B.V., Boxmeer, Holland), a synthetic analog of PGF2α (n = 3–4 animals/time point). At 4, 12, and 18 h following PGF2α injection, ovaries were collected in cold phosphate-buffered saline and washed in phosphate-buffered saline prior to processing. Under sterile conditions, the corpus luteum from the ovary was extirpated, cut into 6–8 pieces, transferred to labeled cryovials, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C until analysis. Also, a small portion of corpus luteum tissue was fixed in Bouin's solution for histological examination. B. PGF2α-induced Luteal Tissue Apoptosis in the Pseudopregnant Rats: Effect of Caspase Inhibitors—Adult rats (Wistar strain) were housed in a controlled environment (22–24 °C) and kept under a photoperiod of 14-h light and 10 h of darkness with ad libitum access to food and water. Pseudopregnancy was induced in the female rats by cohabitation with vasectomized male rats on the afternoon of pro-estrus. Following cohabitation, female rats were examined for the presence of vaginal plug and/or subjected to screening of vaginal smears daily for the extension of the di-estrus period. The presence of vaginal plug/day 1 of continuous di-estrus (at least for 3 days) following cohabitation with the vasectomized male rats was considered as day 1 of pseudopregnancy. In addition, pseudopregnancy was also confirmed by serum progesterone analysis on day 5 of pseudopregnancy. Only the females showing serum progesterone, >50 ng/ml were used in the study. On day 8 of pseudopregnancy, female rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (7.5 mg/rat, intraperitoneal) and abdominal cavity was accessed through two dorsolateral subrenal incisions. The ovary with the surrounding tissues was exposed, and a 30-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml tuberculin syringe was gently entered into the ovarian bursa. Different caspase inhibitors (dissolved in Me2SO) diluted in 0.15 m NaCl solution or vehicle solution for the respective inhibitors (15 μg/ovary) were injected into the ovarian bursal cavity in a volume of 60 μl. Only animals with the swelling of bursa and no visible leakage of the injected fluids were included in the study (n = 3 rats/treatment group). The intrabursal route of administration has been utilized in various in vivo studies to deliver different drugs to the ovary (31Matousek M. Mitsube K. Mikuni M. Brannstrom M. Mol. Hum.

After the completion of the injection procedure, ovaries were returned to the abdominal cavity and the abdominal wall was sutured with absorbable suture and the skin with the surgical clips. Immediately after surgery (15 min), rats received (subcutaneous) either PGF2α (15 μg of cloprostenol, Estrumat, Pitman-Moore Ltd., Harefield, United Kingdom) diluted in 0.3 ml of 0.15 m NaCl or 0.3 ml of 0.15 m NaCl (vehicle) treatment. The animals were killed 24 h later, and the ovaries were visualized under a dissecting microscope and processed for corpora lutea collection. Corpora lutea were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C until analysis. The doses of peptide-based cell-permeable caspase inhibitors used in this study were prepared based on the previous studies where as few as 300 ng of caspase inhibitors/rat have been found to effectively block apoptosis in several in vivo models of apoptosis when injected directly into the tissue of interest (34Cheng Y.

The luteolytic dose of PGF2α employed in this study was based on a previous study in the pseudopregnant rat model (39Bjurulf E. Toffia O. Selstam G. Olofsson J.I. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Corpora lutea were processed for in situ apoptosis analysis according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA fragmentation analysis and immunohistochemistry using Bax polyclonal antibody were carried out as described previously by us (7Yadav V.K. Sudhagar R.R. Medhamurthy R. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from luteal tissue using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The quality and quantity of each RNA sample were assessed spectrophotometrically and on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out essentially as described previously (40Yadav V.K. Muraly P. Medhamurthy R. Mol. Human Reprod. 2004; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were designed for Bax, FasL, Fas, and L-19 genes based on the conserved regions present in mRNA sequences of Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, and Mus musculus. The primers (forward and reverse) and PCR conditions (annealing temperature and PCR cycle number) used were as follows: 5′-TCATCCAGGATCGAGCAGGG-3′ and 5′-CGGCCCCAGTTGAAGTTGCC-3′ for 237-bp Bax (56 °C and 35 cycles); 5′-CCTGTGGATGACTGAGTACC-3′ and 5′-GAGACAGCCAGGAGAAATCA-3′ for 128-bp Bcl-2 (53 °C and 35 cycles); 5′-AATAGGTCACCCCAGTCCACCC-3′ and 5′-CAGCCCAGTTTCATTGATCACAAGGC-3′ for 174-bp FasL (55 °C and 35 cycles); 5′-AGGGGAACGAGTACACAGAC-3′ and 5′-GCAAGGGTTACAGTGTTCAC-3′ for 178-bp Fas (50 °C and 33 cycles); and 5′-GAAATCGCCAATGCCAACTC-3′ and 5′-TCTTAGACCTGCGAGCCTCA-3′ for 406-bp L-19 (58 °C and 25 cycles). Ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels displaying PCR products were scanned using UVI-Tech gel documentation system and quantitated using UVI-Band Map software. Corpus luteum tissue lysate was prepared as per the previously published procedures (7Yadav V.K. Sudhagar R.R. Medhamurthy R. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Equal amount of luteal tissue lysate (200 μg of protein/lane) was resolved by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane, and Western blot analysis was performed as per the published procedures. Autoradiographs were scanned using UVI-Tech gel documentation system and quantitated using UVI-Band Map software. Caspase-8/9 activity assays were performed using fluorogenic substrates Z-IETD-AFC (caspase-8) and Z-LEHD-AFC (caspase-9). Luteal tissues collected before and after PGF2α treatment and after coinjection (15 min apart) of caspase inhibitors and PGF2α were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4). After determining the protein concentration, an equal amount (200 μg) of luteal lysate protein (at non-saturating concentration of the assay, for details see Supplemental Fig. 1) was mixed in 0.5 ml of caspase-8/9 activity assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA) followed by the addition of 20 μm Z-IETD-AFC/10 μm Z-LEHD-AFC substrate. Reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 h, and liberated AFC was measured in a spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 420–520 nm. The specificity of the caspase-8/9 assay was determined by the addition of caspase-8/9-specific inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk/Z-LEHD-fmk). Caspase-3 activity assays were performed using a fluorogenic substrate, Z-DEVD-AFC. Equal amounts (100 μg) of luteal lysate protein (at non-saturating concentration of the assay, for details see Supplemental Fig. 1) from different time points post-PGF2α treatment were added to 1 ml of caspase-3 activity assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT) followed by the addition of 20 μm Z-DEVD-AFC substrate. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and liberated AFC was measured in a spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 420–520 nm. The specificity of the caspase-3 assay was determined by using caspase-3-specific inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO. Rat liver nuclei were prepared as described previously (41Newmeyer D.D. Wilson K.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 42Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Rat liver was homogenized in homogenization buffer (15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm spermine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 250 mm of sucrose in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheese cloth, and an equal volume of homogenization buffer containing 2.3 m sucrose was added and mixed thoroughly. The homogenate then was layered over 5 ml of homogenization buffer containing 2.3 m sucrose in a Beckman SW28 centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 22,000 × rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer at a concentration of ∼3 × 106 nuclei/μl and stored at –70 °C. Purified rat nuclei were used as a chromatin substrate for DNase activity assays, whereas the plasmid DNA obtained from pGEMT empty vector was used as a non-chromatin (naked DNA) substrate for DNase activity assays. For DNase assays crude cytosolic extracts were prepared from the luteal tissue essentially as described previously (43Enari M. Hase A. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5201-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R.

Luteal tissue collected before and at 18 h post-PGF2α treatment was swollen in an equal volume of extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm cytochalasin B, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min followed by five cycles of freezing and thawing, which was accompanied by grinding with a pestle each time. The resultant lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, aliquoted, and frozen at –70 °C until use for protein estimation by Bradford (microassay) method. This supernatant was used as crude luteal cytosolic extract for DNase assays. DNase assays were performed according to the previously published procedures (43Enari M. Hase A. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5201-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 44Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For DNase assay, using non-chromatin substrate, 10 μg of plasmid DNA was incubated with 50 μg of crude luteal cytosolic extract at 37 °C for 30 min (with the exception of the time course analysis of DNase activity where assay was terminated at different time points) in a DNase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride if not stated otherwise). For analysis of pH dependence of the DNase activity, using naked DNA as a substrate, different buffers were used that included acetate NaOH, pH 4.0 and 5.0, phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5, HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 9.0, with the other components of the assay buffer remaining the same. Assay was terminated by the addition of 6×"
https://openalex.org/W2047028098,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid that anchors many proteins to the eukaryotic cell surface. The biosynthetic pathway of GPI is mediated by sequential additions of sugars and other components to phosphatidylinositol. Four mannoses in the GPI are transferred from dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) and are linked through different glycosidic linkages. Therefore, four Dol-P-Man-dependent mannosyltransferases, GPI-MT-I, -MT-II, -MT-III, and -MT-IV for the first, second, third, and fourth mannoses, respectively, are required for generation of GPI. GPI-MT-I (PIG-M), GPI-MT-III (PIG-B), and GPI-MT-IV (SMP3) were previously reported, but GPI-MT-II remains to be identified. Here we report the cloning of PIG-V involved in transferring the second mannose in the GPI anchor. Human PIG-V encodes a 493-amino acid, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein with eight putative transmembrane regions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein encoded in open reading frame YBR004c, which we termed GPI18, has 25% amino acid identity to human PIG-V. Viability of the yeast gpi18 deletion mutant was restored by human PIG-V cDNA. PIG-V has two functionally important conserved regions facing the ER lumen. Taken together, we suggest that PIG-V is the second mannosyltransferase in GPI anchor biosynthesis.

Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), signal transduction (3Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L.

Furthermore, GPI anchor is essential for the viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 8Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10193-10196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei (9Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10336-10341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In mammals, a lack of GPI causes embryonic lethality (10Nozaki M. Ohishi K. Yamada N. Kinoshita T. Nagy A. Takeda J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar); however, GPI is not essential at a single cell level (11Hyman R. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder due to a lack of GPI-anchored proteins, in subpopulations of blood cells (12Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Takeda J. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The biosynthetic pathway of GPI is mediated by the sequential additions of sugars and other components to phosphatidylinositol (PI). The core structure of a GPI anchor, EtNP-6Manα1→2Manα1→6Manα1→4GlcNα1→6-inositol-phospholipid (where EtNP, Man, and GlcN are ethanolamine phosphate, mannose, and glucosamine, respectively), is conserved in all eukaryotic cells (1Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). GPI pre-assembled in the ER is transferred en bloc to proteins bearing the GPI attachment signal sequence at the C terminus. The biosynthetic pathway for GPI is generally conserved among eukaryotic organisms, but a number of significant differences have been found (13Ferguson M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Three mannoses in the common core and the fourth mannose found in yeast and some mammalian GPIs are transferred from dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) and are linked through different glycosidic linkages. The transfer of the first, α1,4-mannose to GlcN-acyl-PI is mediated by GPI-MT-I known as PIG-M in mammals or Gpi14p in S. cerevisiae. The mammalian PIG-M has multiple transmembrane domains and a functionally important DXD motif, a characteristic of many glycosyltransferases, within the first ER luminal domain (14Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Harris C.L. Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kinoshita K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The second mannose, which is the topic of this report, is added by GPI-MT-II, an α1,6-mannosyltransferase. Mammalian PIG-B and its S. cerevisiae orthologue Gpi10p transfer the third, α1,2-mannose to Man2-GlcN-acyl-PI (GPI-MT-III (15Takahashi M. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Endo Y. Fujita T. Takeda J. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4254-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)). PIG-B is an ER protein with multiple transmembrane domains. The α1,2-linked fourth mannose is transferred by Smp3p in S. cerevisiae and hSMP3 in humans (16Grimme S.J. Westfall B.A. Wiedman J.M. Taron C.H. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27731-27739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Taron B.W. Colussi P.A. Wiedman J.M. Orlean P. Taron C.H. J. Biol.

Further, other Dol-P-monosaccharide-utilizing mannosyltransferases and glucosyltransferases involved in N-glycan synthesis and protein O-mannosylation have a common multi-transmembrane topology (18Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Willer T. Valero M.C. Tanner W. Cruces J. Strahl S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Many of them have conserved amino acid residues implicated in catalytic sites within the first large and conserved loop on the luminal side (20Oriol R. Martinez-Duncker I. Chantret I. Mollicone R. Codogno P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was also reported that a large luminally oriented hydrophilic loop is essential for the function of protein O-mannosyltransferase Pmt1p (18Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It appears that these enzymes belong to a superfamily of ER-resident, Dol-P-mannosaccharide-utilizing glycosyltransferases (20Oriol R. Martinez-Duncker I. Chantret I. Mollicone R. Codogno P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Aerolysin is a cytolytic toxin secreted by the Gram-negative bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila (21Buckley J.T. Freer J.H. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1999: 362-372Google Scholar). Aerolysin, secreted as proaerolysin, binds to GPI-anchored proteins on target cells, such as Thy-1, contactin, and erythrocyte aerolysin receptor, becomes active upon proteolysis by the cell-surface protease, and lyses the cell by forming pores (22Abrami L. Fivaz M. van der Goot F.G. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 168-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mutant cells defective in GPI biosynthesis are resistant to aerolysin due to a lack of receptors (23Abrami L. Fivaz M. Kobayashi T. Kinoshita T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30729-30736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We use aerolysin as a tool to isolate mutant CHO cells defective in the biosynthesis of GPI-anchored proteins (24Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F.G. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Here, using aerolysin, we report the isolation of GPI-MT-II-defective CHO cells termed class V mutant cells, and the cloning of the responsible gene, PIG-V. We also report that yeast S. cerevisiae Gpi18p is a functional homologue of PIG-V. Human PIG-V consists of 493 amino acids, bears multiple transmembrane domains, and has two functionally important highly conserved regions in the ER lumen; notably, the first luminal conserved region being compatible with a characteristic of many members in the superfamily of the ER resident glycosyltransferases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGPI-anchored Protein-deficient Cells and Other Cells—A parental CHO cell line D9WT for the isolation of GPI-deficient mutants was generated in a similar way as described previously (24Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F.G. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We stably transfected PIG-L, DPM2, SL15, PIG-A, PIG-O, PIG-U, GnTI, and PIG-F cDNAs (to avoid the isolation of known GPI-deficient mutants) into CHO K1 IIIB2A cells that stably expressed CD59 and DAF as marker GPI-anchored proteins (27Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). D9WT cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 600 μg/ml G418, 200 μg/ml hygromycin, 5 μg/ml puromycin, and 25 μg/ml blasticidin to ensure the maintenance of the cDNAs. For mutagenesis, D9WT cells (1 × 107 cells in a 15-cm dish) were treated with 400 μg/ml ethylmethyl sulfonate (Sigma) for 48 h and cultured for 4 more days. They were then treated with 3 nm proaerolysin (Protox Biotech, Victoria, Canada) for 2 days, washed, and cultured for 2 days. Surviving cells were retreated with 5 nm proaerolysin for 1 day and cloned by limiting dilution. CHO K1 cells and CHO (U) cells defective in the PIG-U gene (28Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Inoue N. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20911-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. JY25 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Flow-cytometric Analysis—Cells were stained with anti-CD59 (5H8) plus fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and biotinylated anti-DAF (IA10) plus phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and analyzed by a FACScan (BD Biosciences).Expression Cloning of Rat PIG-V—We used a rat C6 glioma cDNA library made with a mammalian expression vector, pME, bearing the polyoma virus origin for replication (27Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We transfected 1.44 × 108 CHO D9PA15.6 cells (see “Results” for characterization) with 480 μg each of the library plasmid and pcDNA-PyT(ori-) plasmid for the expression of the polyoma large T by electroporation at 360 V and 960 microfarads. Two days later, transfected cells were stained with biotinylated anti-CD59 plus phycoerythrin-streptavidin, and sorted with a FACS-Vantage (BD Biosciences). Plasmids were recovered in Escherichia coli from the sorted CD59-positive cells, amplified, and transfected again with pcDNA-PyT(ori-) into the same mutant cells. CD59-positive cells were sorted again. Each colony of E. coli transformed with the recovered plasmids was individually transferred into a well of 96-well plates. Plasmids that could restore CD59 expression on the CHO D9PA15.6 cells were selected and sequenced.Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Analysis of GPI—Metabolic labeling with d-[2-3H]mannose and lipid extraction were performed as described previously (29Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolipids were separated by thin layer chromatography on Kiesel gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3) and detected by a Fuji BAS1500 image analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) or x-ray film. To study the effect of YW3548/BE49385A on GPI synthesis, cells were incubated overnight in a medium containing 10 μm BE49385A (a gift from Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan), followed by metabolic labeling with [3H]mannose and lipid extraction, as described above. In some cases, the glycolipids were treated with Jack bean α-mannosidase (Sigma) before TLC analysis.Plasmids—The full-length human PIG-V cDNA was identified in the GenBank™ data base (accession number AK000484) and was provided from the NEDO Human cDNA Sequencing Project (a gift of Dr. S. Sugano, University of Tokyo, Japan). To add an epitope tag at the N terminus of human PIG-V, we amplified human PIG-V cDNA with forward and reverse primers having SalI and NotI sites, respectively; 5′-CCTGGTGGTGTCGACTGGCCCCAGGACCCATCCCGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCCTGGAGGCGGCCGCTCATGTCCAAGGCAGGAAGTTGCAATGTAG-3′. The amplified PCR fragment was cut with SalI and NotI, subcloned into SalI- and NotI-digested pME-3HSV to generate pME-3HSV-hPIG-V, in which the triple HSV tag was linked to the N terminus of PIG-V. The same insert sequence was ligated into pME-GST and pMEEB-GST-FLAG to generate pME-GST-hPIG-V and pMEEB-GST-FLAG-hPIG-V, respectively. Site-directed mutants of PIG-V were generated using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis method.Subcellular Localization of PIG-V—JY25 cells were stably transfected with a cDNA of GST-tagged PIG-V. Transfected cells (3 × 108) were lysed by a Teflon homogenizer in a solution consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After treatment with 1 μg/ml DNase I for 20 min on ice, unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further separated into pellet (P10) and supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant after 10,000 × g centrifugation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and separated into pellet (P100) and supernatant (S100). The pellet was dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm NaCl. Nonidet P-40 was also added to S100 to 1%. GST-tagged PIG-V was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads and Western-blotted with anti-GST antibody. In some experiments, the P100 fraction was further separated with sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described (30Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Membranes were collected from subfractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h and dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40 and 150 mm NaCl. GST-tagged PIG-V was assessed as above. Subfractions were characterized by assaying membrane marker enzymes, alkaline phosphodiesterase I for the plasma membrane, α-mannosidase II for the Golgi, and Dol-P-Man synthase for the ER, as described (30Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Membrane Topology of PIG-V Protein—We transfected pMEEB-GST-FLAG-hPIG-V into CHO K1 cells, selected, and maintained in a medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells were cultured on 14-mm diameter glass coverslips for 1 day, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (31Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8779-8787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, they were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS(+)), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, again washed with PBS(+), and incubated for 20 min in 50 mm NH4Cl to quench residual paraformaldehyde. To permeabilize the plasma membrane selectively, the cells were incubated in a buffer consisting of 0.0005% digitonin, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 6.9), for 15 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with PBS(+) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. For complete permeabilization, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the blocking solution. Cells were then incubated with 2.5 μg/ml goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or 2.5 μg/ml rabbit anti-BiP antibody (ABR, Inc.) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h. After washing four times in PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Chemicon International) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Slides were mounted in Mowiol and studied under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad).Transfection of Human PIG-V into S. cerevisiae—To construct a plasmid for expressing human PIG-V in yeast, we amplified two fragments of the 310-bp upstream region and the 120-bp downstream region of the ORF YBR004c/GPI18 from a S. cerevisiae genomic library by PCR, and digested PCR products with KpnI plus XhoI and with XbaI plus SacI, respectively. Human PIG-V cDNA fragments were obtained from pME-HSV-hPIG-V by digestion with XhoI and XbaI. These three fragments were ligated and subcloned into pRS316 between KpnI and SacI to generate pPIG-V. The heterozygous gpi18 (YBR004c) deletion strain BY4743 MATa/α his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/lue2Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0 lys2Δ0/met15Δ0ybr004c::KANR/YBR004c generated by the Saccharomyces Gene Deletion Project was obtained from ResGen™. We transformed the heterozygous GPI18/gpi18::KANR diploid with pPIG-V containing URA3 and selected with SD medium without uracil. Transformed diploid cells were sporulated, and complementation was assessed by tetrad analysis. Four viable haploids from a tetrad were grown on a YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) agar plate, a YPD plate containing G418 (200 μg/ml), and a YPD plate containing 5-fluoroorotic acid.RESULTSIsolation of Novel Class Mutants Defective in GPI Biosynthesis—To screen mutant CHO cells defective in GPI biosynthesis, we used aerolysin, a GPI-recognizing pore-forming toxin produced by Aeromonas hydrophila (24Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F.G. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We chemically mutagenized the parental CHO D9WT cells, which were stably transfected with human CD59 and DAF as markers of GPI-anchored proteins (Fig. 1A), and with cDNAs of known genes involved in GPI biosynthesis, to avoid generation of known complementation classes of GPI-deficient mutants. After treatment with 5 μm proaerolysin, three aerolysin-resistant cells termed D9PA15.6, -25.2, and -72.1 were obtained (D9PA GPI(-) cells). As expected, these three mutant cell lines were deficient in the surface expression of CD59 and DAF. D9PA15.6 and D9PA72.1 cells were almost completely deficient in CD59 expression and had only 1% of the normal level of DAF (Fig. 1, C and E). D9PA25.2 cells showed heterogeneous expression of CD59 and DAF (Fig. 1D). Because the defective phenotypes of these mutants were not restored by transfection of any known cDNAs involved in GPI biosynthesis, we considered that they belong to a new class of mutant.D9PA GPI(-) Cells Are Defective in Transfer of the Second Mannose—To determine a step in GPI biosynthesis at which D9PAGPI(-) cells are defective, we analyzed the biosynthesis of GPI by metabolically labeling the cells with [3H]mannose (Fig. 2A). As a control, we used GPI transamidase-defective PIG-U mutant cells, C311PA16 (25Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which accumulated various GPI intermediates (lane 1 in Fig. 2, A–C). All D9PAGPI (-) cells accumulated two GPI intermediates H2 and H5 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–4), suggesting that they belong to the same class of mutants.Fig. 2GPI biosynthesis in the class V mutant CHO cells.A, cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]mannose. GPI intermediates were extracted and analyzed by TLC. Lane 1, PIG-U-defective CHO C311PA16; lane 2, D9PA25.2; lane 3, D9PA15.6; lane 4, D9PA72.1; lane 5, D9WT cells.

B, PIG-U-defective C311PA16 cells (lanes 1 and 2) and D9PA15.6 cells (lanes 3 and 4) were preincubated with (lanes 2 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 3) 10 μm BE49385A for 24 h, followed by labeling with [3H]mannose. C, the radiolabeled mannolipids extracted from C311PA16 cells (lanes 1 and 2) and D9PA15.6 cells (lanes 3 and 4) were treated with (lanes 2 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 3) Jack bean α-mannosidase for 24 h, re-extracted and analyzed by TLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the accumulated GPI intermediates are indeed H2 and H5, we used YW3548/BE49385A and Jack bean α-mannosidase. YW3548/BE49385A (a terpenoid lactone from fungi) inhibits PIG-N that transfers the EtNP-side chain to the first mannose (32Sutterlin C. Horvath A. Gerold P. Schwarz R.T. Wang Y. Dreyfuss M.

By treatment with YW3548/BE49385A, the spot with the lower RF value disappeared, whereas that with the higher RF value remained, confirming that the lower RF spot was H5, which has one mannose with EtNP modification (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). When these intermediates were treated with Jack bean α-mannosidase, only the one with the higher RF was sensitive, indicating that it was H2 having one mannose without modification (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, these mutants are defective in the second mannosyltransferase (GPI-MT-II). We termed these mutant cells as class V.PIG-V cDNA Restores the Surface Expression of GPI-anchored Proteins on D9PAGPI(-) Cells—To obtain the gene responsible for class V mutant cells, termed PIG-V for phosphatidyl inositol glycan class V, we transfected a rat cDNA expression library into D9PA15.6 cells, collected CD59-positive cells using a cell sorter, and rescued the plasmids. One plasmid containing the 2429-bp cDNA fragment restored the surface expression of CD59 on D9PA15.6 cells as well as D9PA25.2 and D9PA72.1 after transfection (data not shown) (accession number AB196341). Based on the sequence homology, we cloned human PIG-V cDNA (AK000484), which consists of 2080 bp, and stably transfected it into D9PA15.6 cells. The human PIG-V cDNA recovered the surface expression of CD59 on D9PA15.6 cells (Fig. 3A) and normalized the profile of GPI mannolipids (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3PIG-V cDNA fully restored the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins and GPI biosynthesis.A and B, CHO D9PA15.6 cells were stably transfected with human PIG-V (A, thick line and B, lane 1) or with a mock vector (A, thin line and B, lane 2), or untransfected (A, dotted line and B, lane 3), and analyzed by FACS for the surface expression of CD59 (panel A) and by the in vivo [3H]mannose labeling for GPI biosynthesis (panel B). C, PIG-U-deficient CHO C311PA16 cells were transiently transfected with human PIG-V cDNA or a mock vector. Two days after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]mannose, and extracted lipids were separated by TLC.

H2 and H5 have one mannose without and with an EtNP side chain, respectively. One of the unsolved issues in mammalian GPI biosynthesis pathway is whether H2 or H5 is the substrate of GPI-MT-II. To address this, we transiently transfected PIG-V cDNA or mock vector into PIG-U-defective C311PA16 cells, which accumulate various GPI intermediates, including H2 and H5. Two days after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]mannose, and GPI intermediates were analyzed by TLC.If H2 is the main substrate, it would be decreased and H3 would be increased after PIG-V transfection. Alternatively, if H5 is the substrate, it would be decreased, and B and H6 would be increased. The mock transfected cells accumulated various GPIs (H2-H7) (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 3) (25Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When cells were transfected with PIG-V, the amount of H2 was decreased from 44% of total GPIs to 29% with a concomitant increase of H3 from 13% to 24% (lanes 2 and 4). Because this is the biggest change after PIG-V transfection, it is suggested that PIG-V mainly mediates the H2 to H3 conversion, i.e. H2 is the major substrate of GPI-MT-II (Fig. 3D). H5 was also decreased in the PIG-V overexpressed cells, but t"
https://openalex.org/W2070649188,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains a number of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases of the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) family that catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds in newly synthesized proteins. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel member of the human PDI family, TMX3 (thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 3). The TMX3 gene encodes a protein of 454 amino acid residues that contains a predicted N-terminal signal sequence, a single domain with sequence similarity to thioredoxin and a CGHC active site sequence, a potential transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal KKKD tetrapeptide sequence that matches the classical KKXX-type consensus sequence for ER retrieval of type I transmembrane proteins. Endogenous TMX3 contains endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycans, localizes to the ER by immunofluorescence microscopy, and is present in the membrane fraction after alkaline extraction of the ER luminal content. The TMX3 transcript is found in a variety of tissues and is not up-regulated by the unfolded protein response. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of the recombinantly expressed luminal domain of TMX3 showed features typical of a properly folded protein of the α/β type. The redox potential of recombinant luminal TMX3 was determined to -0.157 V, similar to the values previously found for PDI and ERp57. Interestingly, TMX3 showed oxidase activity, and in human tissue-culture cells the protein was found partially in the oxidized form, potentially suggesting a function of the protein as a dithiol oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1972851759,"Endocannabinoids act as retrograde signals to modulate synaptic transmission. Little is known, however, about their significance in integrated network activity underlying motor behavior. We have examined the physiological effects of endocannabinoids in a neuronal network underlying locomotor behavior using the isolated lamprey spinal cord. Our results show that endocannabinoids are released during locomotor activity and participate in setting the baseline burst rate. They are released in response to mGluR1 activation and act as retrograde messengers. This conditional release of endocannabinoids can transform motoneurons and crossing interneurons into modulatory neurons by enabling them to regulate their inhibitory synaptic inputs and thus contribute to the modulation of the locomotor burst frequency. These results provide evidence that endocannabinoid retrograde signaling occurs within the locomotor network and contributes to motor pattern generation and regulation in the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2018911570,"We used the cerebellum as a model to study the morphogenetic and cellular processes underlying the formation of elaborate brain structures from a simple neural tube, using an inducible genetic fate mapping approach in mouse. We demonstrate how a 90 degrees rotation between embryonic days 9 and 12 converts the rostral-caudal axis of dorsal rhombomere 1 into the medial-lateral axis of the wing-like bilateral cerebellar primordium. With the appropriate use of promoters, we marked specific medial-lateral domains of the cerebellar primordium and derived a positional fate map of the murine cerebellum. We show that the adult medial cerebellum is produced by expansion, rather than fusion, of the thin medial primordium. Furthermore, ventricular-derived cells maintain their original medial-lateral coordinates into the adult, whereas rhombic lip-derived granule cells undergo lateral to medial posterior transverse migrations during foliation. Thus, we show that progressive changes in the axes of the cerebellum underlie its genesis."

Rat liver CDO was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a 26.8-kDa N-terminal fusion protein bearing a polyhistidine tag. Purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography yielded homogeneous protein, which was catalytically active even in the absence of the secondary protein-A, which has been reported to be essential for activity in partially purified native preparations. As compared with those existing purification protocols for native CDO, the milder conditions used in the isolation of the recombinant CDO allowed a more controlled study of the properties and activity of CDO, clarifying conflicting findings in the literature. Apo-protein was inactive in catalysis and was only activated by iron. Metal analysis of purified recombinant protein indicated that only 10% of the protein contained iron and that the iron was loosely bound to the protein. Kinetic studies showed that the recombinant enzyme displayed a Km value of 2.5 ± 0.4 mm at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. The enzyme was shown to be specific for l-cysteine oxidation, whereas homocysteine inhibited CDO activity.

Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) 1The abbreviations used are: CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HFBA, heptafluorobutyric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. is a metalloenzyme present in mammalian cells (1Yamaguchi K. Natural Sulfur Compounds. Plenum Press, New York1980: 175-186Crossref Google Scholar) and in the yeast Histoplasma capsulatum (2Kumar V. Maresca B. Sacco M. Goewert R. Kobayashi G.S. Medoff G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is a non-heme iron-containing enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the thiol group of cysteine to yield cysteine sulfinic acid (cysteine sulfinate), the first step in cysteine catabolism and a key intermediate process in taurine synthesis (Scheme 1). Alternatively, cysteine sulfinate can feed to the pyruvate and sulfate pool (3Griffith O. Mammalian Sulfur Amino Acid Metabolism: An Overview.in: Methods in Enzymology. 143. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 366-376Google Scholar). Cysteine dioxygenase has a profound impact on health by reducing the cysteine pool and increasing the levels of important metabolites such as taurine and sulfate. Cysteine is both toxic at high levels and readily oxidizes to form poorly soluble cystine (4Weinstein C.L. Haschemeyer R.H. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16568-16579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been noted that cysteine elicits excitotoxic behavior by acting on the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (5Olney J.W. Zorumski C. Price M.T. Labruyere J. Science. 1990; 248: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Other researchers postulate that this amino acid contributes to the formation of reactive oxygen species, oxidizing essential molecules such as the catecholaminergic neurotransmitter dopamine (6Shen X.M. Zhang F. Dryhurst G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). High levels of this amino acid have been connected to neurological disorders such as motor neuron disease (7Pean A.R. Parsons R.B. Waring R.H. Williams A.C. Ramsden D.B. J. Neurol. Sci. 1995; 129: 107-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease (8Parsons R.B. Waring R.H. Ramsden D.B. Williams A.C. Neurotoxicology. 1998; 19: 599-603PubMed Google Scholar). Localized accumulation of cyst(e)ine and decreased activity of CDO has been observed in patients suffering from the rare neurological disorder Hallervorden-Spatz disease (9Perry T.L. Norman M.G. Yong V.W. Whiting S. Crichton J.U. Hansen S. Kish S.J. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 18: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, poor sulfoxidation and the reduced formation of inorganic sulfate are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (10Emery P. Bradley H. Gough A. Arthur V. Jubb R. Waring R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cysteine dioxygenase supplies the intermediate cysteine sulfinate for taurine formation, which has diverse roles in mammalian organisms such as in bile salt synthesis (11Huxtable R.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 483: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in maintaining cardiac function (12Satoh H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 403: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and in protecting neural cells from excitotoxicity and damage induced by ischemia (13Saransaari P. Oja S.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 403: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that taurine functions as a neurotransmitter because it is the second most abundant amino acid in the central nervous system (14Kamisaki Y. Wada K. Nakamoto K. Itoh T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 403: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taurine plays a key role in stabilizing mammalian skeletal muscle membrane, and based on studies with aged rats it is hypothesized that changes in muscle function during aging could be associated with a reduction of taurine content (15Pierno S. De Luca A. Huxtable R.J. Camerino D.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 403: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the 1960s, it was demonstrated that crude rat liver extracts contain an enzyme that produced l-cysteine sulfinic acid from l-cysteine (16Sörbo B. Ewetz L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 18: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17De Marco C. Mosti R. Cavallini D. Boll. Soc. Ital. Biol. Sper. 1966; 42: 94-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ewetz L. Sörbo B.

Physics. 1969; 1: 1-23Google Scholar, 20Yamaguchi K. Sakakibara S. Koga K. Ueda I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 237: 502-512Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Through labeling studies with 18O2 and H 182O, Lombardini et al. (21Lombardini J.B. Singer T.P. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1172-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the enzyme is a dioxygenase. Early studies on this protein were hampered by the instability of the enzyme to conventional isolation procedures. Cysteine dioxygenase was purified to homogeneity by Yamaguchi et al. (22Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Kori Y. Sakakibara S. Ueda I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the process yielded an inactive form of the enzyme. The same research group discovered that the metalloenzyme could be reactivated by preincubation with l-cysteine under anaerobic conditions (23Sakakibara S. Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Ueda I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The activated enzyme was reported to be rapidly and irreversibly inactivated during aerobic assays, but the inactivation could be prevented by the presence of a second cytosolic protein, protein A. According to Yamaguchi and co-workers (23Sakakibara S. Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Ueda I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), protein A does not participate in the catalytic process because neither Km nor the initial reaction velocity is altered by its presence. The rat liver CDO purified by Yamaguchi and Hosokawa (24Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was characterized as a single subunit protein composed of 200 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa and a pI value of 5.5. Atomic absorption analysis indicated 0.8 moles of iron per mole of enzyme. Despite numerous reports that confirm the 22.5-kDa mass of CDO, a stable protein of 68 kDa was recently reported by Waring and co-workers (25Parsons R.B. Ramsden D.B. Waring R.H. Barber P.C. Williams A.C. J. Hepatol. 1998; 29: 595-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Wilkinson L.J. Waring R.H. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2002; 16: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This protein did not dissociate even in the presence of SDS and reducing agents at boiling temperatures. In the present study, we report the cloning, overexpression in Escherichia coli, purification, and characterization of recombinant rat liver cysteine dioxygenase. The findings obtained using homogeneous recombinant protein purified under mild conditions provide insights into the properties and activity of this important enzyme in the cysteine metabolic pathway and clarify conflicting results in the literature. Chemicals—Sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, ferrous sulfate, and cobalt sulfate were purchased from Fisher Scientific, and imidazole was from Acros Organics. Tryptone, yeast extract, ammonium acetate, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, MES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and EDTA were obtained from Sigma. 1,10-Phenanthroline monohydrate was acquired from Avocado Research Chemicals. Cysteine, homocysteine, cysteine sulfinic acid, and heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. All chemicals were used as received. Biotinylated thrombin was purchased from Novagen, Inc. Amplification of Cysteine Dioxygenase cDNA Sequence—Amplification of CDO cDNA was done with reverse transcription-PCR. Primers were designed based on the CDO cDNA sequence published by Hosokawa et al. (27Hosokawa Y. Matsumoto A. Oka J. Itakura H. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). First-strand rat liver CDO cDNA was made from 1 μg of total rat liver RNA, using the primer 5′-GCTTGTGGTTTCTTCATTTTTAC-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 1119 to 1141 of the CDO cDNA. Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase was utilized in the synthesis of the CDO clone. A standard PCR reaction with forward and reverse primers corresponding to nucleotides 155–171 and 863–880, respectively, of CDO cDNA, was carried out with Taq polymerase to amplify the newly synthesized CDO clone. In addition to the required CDO sequence, the forward primer contained an XhoI restriction site and the reverse primer a BamHI restriction site to facilitate insertion of the amplified fragment in the sense orientation into the pET-14b vector. The identity of recombinant clones as CDO cDNA was confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar). Finally, the amplified fragment was cloned into a pET-14b vector. Overexpression and Purification of Rat Liver CDO in E. coli—The CDO open reading frame was subcloned into the pET-14b vector, and the pET-14b/CDO-ORF plasmid was then transferred into the E. coli strain BL21(D3)pLysS. 1.5 liter of bacterial cells were grown in LB medium at 22 °C for 8 h to an A580 of 0.5, after which expression of the recombinant CDO protein was induced by addition of 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and supplemented with 200 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm sodium chloride and 10 mm imidazole. The suspension was kept frozen at –80 °C for subsequent analysis, after which the cells were lysed by thawing the solution in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and DNase I. The cell extract was loaded onto a column containing 25 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and washed with 2 liter of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, with 300 mm sodium chloride and 30 mm imidazole. Elution of the fusion protein was accomplished with 300 mm imidazole in the same phosphate buffer solution. Removal of imidazole and buffer exchange were carried out by ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut off membrane. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli method (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cysteine Sulfinic Acid by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—The purified protein was tested for activity by incubating the protein with l-cysteine, and the product of the reaction was determined by ion pair reversed-phase HPLC using a Particil 10 ODS-3 C18 column. The samples were ultrafiltered using a 10-kDa membrane prior to injection. Isocratic analysis of a 50-μl injected sample solution was achieved using a mobile phase system composed of 99.4:0.6 (v/v) water:methanol with 0.3% HFBA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 215 nm. The peak eluting at 6.5 min was confirmed to be the product cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) by retention time comparison with standards. His Tag Removal from the Recombinant CDO and the Activity of CDO without the Fusion Tag—To examine the possible competition between the His tag and enzyme active site for iron, the His tag was removed using an N-terminal thrombin cleavage site. Recombinant CDO (320 μl of 1.38 mg/ml) was dissolved in 0.2 m ammonium acetate and 0.1 m sodium chloride at pH 7.5 and mixed with 120 μl of 10× thrombin cleavage buffer, 80 μl of thrombin solution (∼0.04 units of thrombin per μl), and 160 μl of deionized water and left for 5 days at room temperature. The thrombin cleavage reaction was monitored at different time intervals by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which showed that 5 days were required for complete cleavage. The activity was monitored during this period, and no loss of activity was observed. After completion of the cleavage reaction, the thrombin cleavage buffer was replaced by 50 mm ammonium acetate solution by using ultrafiltration with 10-kDa molecular mass cut off ultrafiltration tubes. This sample was sent for electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis, which confirmed the expected molecular mass (see below). The activity of the thrombin cleavage product was determined from a portion of this sample (20 μl) by incubating it with 980 μl of 33 mm cysteine in 0.2 m ammonium acetate with 0.1 m sodium chloride at pH 7.5 at 37 °C for 3 h. The activity obtained was compared with that of the recombinant enzyme prior to thrombin cleavage under identical conditions. Activities of CDO with and without the His tag were also determined in the presence of excess ferrous ions. To 30 μl of each CDO sample was added 770 μl of 100 mm cysteine and a volume of a 19.1 mm solution of ferrous chloride sufficient to provide a 1000× molar excess of Fe2+. The final volume was adjusted to 1 ml, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The use of immobilized metal affinity chromatography has been shown to be a relatively simple and fast way to obtain homogeneous solution of recombinant cysteine dioxygenase, avoiding the tedious and complex purification protocol reported by Yamaguchi and Hosokawa (24Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). With its 235 amino acids, the recombinant protein has a molecular mass of 26.8 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis was used to monitor the purification of recombinant CDO. At an earlier stage of the project, our investigations were hindered by the presence of inclusion bodies when the culture was grown at 37 °C; this problem was overcome by lowering the temperature to 22 °C together with iron supplementation. Anion exchange chromatography has been used by other investigators in the determination of cysteine sulfinic acid, which required that sample pretreatment remove cysteine and other cations from solution (30Bagley P.J. Hirschberger L.L. Stipanuk M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We used reversed-phase liquid chromatography because of its precision and robustness at different types and amount of salt in the sample buffer. By using the ion pair agent HFBA, the very polar molecule cysteine sulfinic acid could be retained and separated from other compounds. The use of trifluoroacetic acid, a shorter analytical column, or a higher organic percentage in the mobile phase could not prevent CSA from eluting at the void volume. The negative peaks (system peaks) observed in the chromatogram are typically found in HPLC analysis using UV detection and mobile phases containing components that give a measurable detector response (31Levin S. Grushka E. Anal. Chem. 1986; 58: 1602-1607Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant CDO showed the continuous formation of the product CSA for over 30 h as illustrated in Fig. 1 (inset). The reaction solution contained only the enzyme and the substrate cysteine with no additional cofactor or protein. We also investigated the effect of anaerobic preincubation of the recombinant CDO in the presence of cysteine for 30 min (Fig. 1). We observed an initial increase in the amount of CSA produced with this anaerobic preincubation, but the activity of the pre-incubated sample became indistinguishable from the sample without pretreatment after 120 min. We have investigated the Michaelis-Menten constant for the recombinant protein (Fig. 2). Bagley et al. (30Bagley P.J. Hirschberger L.L. Stipanuk M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported a maximal activity at a substrate concentration of 5 mmol/L cysteine, whereas the Yamaguchi group (22Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Kori Y. Sakakibara S. Ueda I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) determined a Km value of 0.45 mmol/liter. Our studies indicated a Km of 2.5 ± 0.4 mm, corresponding to half the maximal value stated by Bagley. Several optimal pH values for CDO activity have been stated in the literature, ranging from 6.1–9.0. In our studies, we observed that a pH of 7.5 provides the maximum activity (Fig. 2, inset), which is reasonable given the pH in the cytosol. The purified recombinant CDO was subjected to metal analysis by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy to quantitate the amount of iron present. The results revealed that only 10% of the as-isolated protein contained iron, implying a loosely bound iron in the metallocenter, which is observed in several other mononuclear non-heme iron oxygenases (32McKay D.B. Prucha M. Reineke W. Timmis K.N. Pieper D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2944-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Riegert U. Heiss G. Kuhm A.E. Muller C. Contzen M. Knackmuss H.J. Stolz A.

The activity of the as-purified CDO increased when incubated with excess Fe2+ (Fig. 3A). To establish that the reaction is in fact catalyzed by iron, the activity of the protein was also evaluated in the presence of the metal chelators, EDTA and o-phenanthroline (Fig. 3B). As expected, the activity diminished with increasing concentrations of the chelators. EDTA was also used to prepare apo-protein, and after removing the chelating agent, the activity of the metal-free CDO was compared with reconstituted enzyme (Fig. 4A). Essentially no activity was observed for the apo-enzyme.Fig. 4A, activity comparison between apo-enzyme and enzyme reconstituted with ferrous ions. A solution of CDO (300 μl of 3.4 mg/ml) was treated with EDTA for 9 h at room temperature, and then the EDTA was removed by ultrafiltration. The apo-CDO sample was then combined with 4.2 ml of 23 mm cysteine and with either 600 μl of 1.8 mm ferrous sulfate (•) or 600 μlof0.2 m ammonium acetate with 0.1 m NaCl at pH 7.5 (○). The solutions were incubated at 37 °C, and 1-ml aliquots were taken at different intervals. HFBA was added to the fractions to quench the reaction prior to HPLC analysis. B, effect of enzyme incubation with cobalt ions. An aliquot of a solution containing CDO (5.15 ml, 0.048 mg/ml) and 9.9 mm cysteine in 0.2 m ammonium acetate with 0.1 m NaCl at pH 7.5 was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 0.17 mm cobalt sulfate (○) or absence of cobalt ions (•). The assay was performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among several metals commonly found in metalloenzymes, including manganese, cobalt, copper, and nickel, iron was the only metal that could reactivate the enzyme after being treated with chelating agents. However, cobalt ions in the reaction solution slowed down CDO activity as demonstrated in Fig. 4B. To assess the effect of the His tag present in the recombinant protein on iron binding and the activity of recombinant CDO, the fusion peptide was removed by cleavage with thrombin, which recognizes the sequence Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser, cleaving between the Arg-17 and Gly-18 residues in recombinant CDO. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirmed the expected mass of 24,951 Da for the thrombin cleavage product with an observed mass of 24,951.90 ± 4.49 Da. Comparisons of the activity of recombinant CDO with and without the His tag showed no significant difference. The intact fusion protein had an activity of 17.3 μm CSA/(mg CDO × min), whereas that treated with thrombin gave a value of 17.4 μm CSA/(mg CDO × min). In the presence of excess Fe2+ at a molar ratio of 1000, CDO with the His tag showed an increase in activity of 20%, whereas the activity of the thrombin cleavage product increased 23%. Recombinant cysteine dioxygenase was observed to be highly specific for l-cysteine. Methionine and homocysteine were not shown to be potential substrates, and the latter displayed inhibitory effects. Fig. 5 illustrates an inverse relation between CSA production and homocysteine concentration. CDO activity declined by 50% at homocysteine levels of 6.5 mm, at which point the inhibitor concentration is 2.6 times higher than that of the substrate. Recombinant rat liver CDO was expressed and purified to homogeneity and shown to be catalytically active in converting l-cysteine to CSA. It has been reported that cysteine dioxygenase is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated during assay, which is prevented by protein A (35Sakakibara S. Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa S. Kohashi N. Ueda I. Sakamoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The recombinant CDO purified in our research group was catalytically active and did not require the presence of a second protein to be functionally active, as it was observed continuous production of CSA for over 30 h (Fig. 1, inset). Clearly, the enzyme was not deactivated by oxygen, and protein A was not required for activity. The need for anaerobic preincubation of the enzyme with the substrate to achieve maximal reactivity was also indicated in the literature (1Yamaguchi K. Natural Sulfur Compounds. Plenum Press, New York1980: 175-186Crossref Google Scholar). We observed an initial increase in the amount of CSA produced with 30-min preincubation under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1). The initial rate (as demonstrated by the slopes in the figure) with the preincubation was about 40% higher than without it. This difference was no longer apparent after 120 min. Because the enzyme was clearly active without preincubation, and because assays without the anaerobic pretreatment provided a linear increase of CSA over the time analyzed, anaerobic preincubation was not used for further kinetic studies. The recombinant enzyme displayed a Km value of 2.5 ± 0.4 mm at 37 °C and at the optimum pH value of 7.5. Metal analysis indicated 10% iron incorporation into the as-isolated protein, which was inactivated by the presence of EDTA and o-phenanthroline. The activity of the apo-enzyme could be restored by reconstitution with Fe2+. Iron was kept in the Fe2+ form during the assay by using large amounts of cysteine, which reduces Fe(III) to Fe(II). The possibility that the His tag could affect the binding of iron in the active site or the enzyme kinetics was examined by cleaving the N-terminal fusion peptide with thrombin, which recognizes the amino acids Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser and cleaves recombinant CDO between Arg-17 and Gly-18, removing the His tag. To ensure complete digestion, CDO was incubated with thrombin for an extended period. Under these conditions, a small amount of cleavage at another site was also detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This cleavage occurs between Ala-34 and Gly-35 and is also within the fusion peptide. The thrombin cleavage product had an activity that was indistinguishable from the recombinant CDO with an intact His tag. As the presence of additional ferrous ions was shown to increase enzyme activity, intact recombinant CDO and the thrombin cleavage product were assayed in the presence of excess Fe2+. Similar increases in activity were observed for both CDO samples (20 and 23% for CDO with and without the His tag, respectively). Interestingly, cobalt in the reaction solution was shown to inhibit CDO activity (Fig. 4B). Presumably, cobalt displaces iron from the active site or otherwise hinders iron binding, thereby reducing the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The recombinant enzyme appeared to be highly specific for cysteine oxidation. Methionine and homocysteine were not shown to be substrates for CDO, however the latter inhibited CDO activity suggesting that homocysteine may have a direct impact on cysteine metabolism. High levels of homocysteine together with elevated amounts of cysteine have been observed in diseases such as in Alzheimer disease (36McCaddon A. Hudson P. Hill D. Barber J. Lloyd A. Davies G. Regland B. Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 53: 254-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the increase in cysteine levels is a result of CDO inhibition by homocysteine.

Uncertainty regarding the mechanism of HA biosynthesis has included the directionality of chain elongation, i.e. whether addition of monosaccharide units occurs at the reducing or non-reducing terminus of nascent chains. We have investigated this problem using yeast-derived recombinant HA synthases from Xenopus laevis (xlHAS1) and from Streptococcus pyogenes (spHAS). The enzymes were incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcUA and UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, under experimental conditions designed to yield HA chains with differentially labeled reducing-terminal and non-reducing terminal domains. Digestion of the products with a mixture of β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase exoenzymes resulted in truncation of the HA chain strictly from the non-reducing end and release of labeled monosaccharides. The change in 3H/14C ratio of the monosaccharide fraction, during the course of exoglycosidase digestion, was interpreted to indicate whether sugar units had been added at the reducing or non-reducing end. The results demonstrate that the vertebrate xlHAS1 and the bacterial spHAS extend HA in opposite directions. Chain elongation catalyzed by xlHAS1 occurs at the non-reducing end of the HA chain, whereas elongation catalyzed by spHAS occurs at the reducing end. The spHAS is the first glycosyltransferase that has been unanimously demonstrated to function at the reducing end of a growing glycosaminoglycan chain.

HA is an important structural component of the extracellular matrix and is also involved in a wide variety of biological process, such as tissue morphogenesis, cancer metastasis, wound healing, inflammation, and angiogenesis (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar, 2Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). This extended linear polymer is synthesized, apparently without any primer requirement, by alternate addition of d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) units from the corresponding UDP-sugar donors (UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc). HASs have been tentatively classified based on primary structure, molecular size, predicted membrane topology, and enzymological characteristics (6DeAngelis P.L. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 56: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Class I thus includes the streptococcal, the vertebrate (3 isoforms, HAS1–3), and the viral enzymes, whereas Class II contains a single member, the Pasteurella multocida enzyme. However, without knowledge of the three-dimensional structures or the catalytic mechanism, the two-class nomenclature system remains an hypothesis.Although biochemical properties and in vivo functional aspects of HAS proteins have been extensively studied, the mechanism of HA biosynthesis has remained unclear. The biosynthesis of chondroitin and heparan sulfates, and glycosaminoglycans with backbones of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine units, clearly occurs by a stepwise addition of monosaccharide units at the non-reducing termini of nascent chains (7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar), and the same mechanism of elongation has been demonstrated for the Escherichia coli K4 and K5 capsular polysaccharides (8Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2682-2687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Lidholt K. Fjelstad M. Jann K. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as well as for chitin (10Imai T. Watanabe T. Yui T. Sugiyama J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 755-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cellulose (11Koyama M. Helbert W. Imai T. Sugiyama J. Henrissat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In an early assessment of the directionality of HA chain elongation, Stoolmiller and Dorfman (12Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used a particulate enzyme preparation from Group A Streptococcus (now known as HasA or spHAS). They identified products released by enzymatic digestion of metabolically labeled HA chains and concluded that chain elongation occurs at the non-reducing end, as in biosynthesis of other glycosaminoglycans (12Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prehm (13Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) approached the problem by digesting pulse-chase-labeled HA produced by a teratocarcinoma cell membrane fraction and proposed, by contrast, that chain elongation occurs at the reducing end. This notion has by and large prevailed (see e.g. Ref. 14Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both of these native enzyme systems failed to further extend preformed, exogenously added HA oligosaccharides. However, in more recent studies, recombinant HAS from P. multocida (15DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as well as a recombinant truncated form of the vertebrate HAS2 isoform (16Hoshi H. Nakagawa H. Nishiguchi S. Iwata K. Niikura K. Monde K. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2341-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were found to catalyze the addition of sugar units at the non-reducing ends of added oligosaccharide primers.Because of these contradictory results, we decided to reinvestigate the directionality of HA chain elongation catalyzed by a vertebrate and a bacterial HAS. Yeast recombinant HASs from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis (xlHAS1) and from Streptococcus pyogenes (spHAS) were applied to experiments designed to yield HA samples with differentially radiolabeled reducing terminal and non-reducing terminal domains, which were subsequently degraded to monosaccharides by exoglycosidase digestion. Our results demonstrate, unexpectedly, that xlHAS1 and spHAS extend HA at opposite ends of the polysaccharide. The xlHAS1 adds new sugars at the non-reducing end of the growing HA chain, whereas spHAS extends HA at the reducing end.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Radiolabeled UDP-[14C]GlcNAc was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. UDP-[3H]GlcUA was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were from Sigma. β-N-Acetyl-d-glucosaminidase from jack bean was purchased from Seikagaku Corporation, and β-d-glucuronidase from bovine liver was from Sigma. All separation media and columns were bought from Amersham Biosciences. Unless otherwise noted, additional chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Corporation.Expression and Purification of xlHAS1 and spHAS—Recombinant yeast xlHAS1 and spHAS were prepared as described previously in (17Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.-M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ5461 strain containing the pYES/DG+ plasmid (for xlHAS1 expression) or the pYES/HA plasmid (for spHAS expression) was grown in uracil-deficient medium containing 0.1% glucose and 5% glycerol, and expression was obtained by galactose induction to a final concentration of 1%. Upon induction, the enzyme expressed accumulates in the plasma membrane fraction. The cells were disrupted with silica/sirconia beads (0.5 mm) in a MiniBead-Beater-8 (Biospec), and crude membranes were retrieved by ultracentrifugation. After harvesting, the membrane pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μm E-64, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Protein was quantified by the Coomassie dye binding assay (Pierce) using a bovine serum albumin standard (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213164) Google Scholar).Hyaluronan Synthesis and Isolation—Radiolabeled sugar units were incorporated into growing HA chains from the precursors, UDP-[14C]-GlcNAc (285 mCi/mmol) and/or UDP-[3H]GlcUA (10.2 Ci/mmol). Crude membranes (120 μg of total protein/100 μl of total reaction volume) were incubated at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA, together with UDP-sugars as follows (see schemes in Fig. 1). In one approach (see Fig. 1, Protocol 1), the xlHAS1 or spHAS membranes were incubated with 150 μm UDP-[14C]GlcNAc and 50 μm UDP-GlcUA. After 1 min (xlHAS1) or 4 min (spHAS) of reaction, 1 μm UDP-[3H]GlcUA was added to the mixtures, and the reactions were allowed to continue for an additional 30 s (xlHAS1) or 6 min (spHAS). In a second approach (see Fig. 1, Protocol 2), the membranes were incubated with 25 μm UDP-GlcNAc and 50 μm UDP-[3H]GlcUA. After 1 min (xlHAS1) or 5 min (spHAS) of reaction, 150 μm UDP-[14C]GlcNAc was added, and incubation was continued for 1.5 min (xlHAS1) or 5 min (spHAS). In a third approach (see Fig. 1, Protocol 3), the membranes were incubated simultaneously with both labeled UDP-sugars, 150 μm UDP-[14C]GlcNAc and 50 μm UDP-[3H]-GlcUA, for 1.5 min (xlHAS1) or 10 min (spHAS). Reactions were terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 1%), and the mixtures were neutralized with 4 m NaOH and then heated at 100 °C for 3 min. After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min), the remaining UDP-sugars were separated from HA in the supernatants by gel chromatography on columns (1 × 13 cm) of Sephadex G-25 fine, equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Labeled products were quantified by scintillation counting.Enzymatic Degradation of Hyaluronan—Labeled HA was desalted on PD-10 columns and lyophilized under speed vacuum overnight. The samples were then dissolved in 3–4 ml of MES-NaOH buffer pH 5.5 containing 0.1% of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 units of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and 10,400 units of β-glucuronidase and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots of 0.6–0.8 ml were withdrawn after different periods of time, and digestion was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 20% SDS. The samples were then boiled for 3 min at 100 °C and clarified by centrifugation. Digests and control samples were analyzed by gel chromatography on a FPLC Superose 6 column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Effluent fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Labeled monosaccharides released from HA emerged as a single distinct peak at the elution position of standard monosaccharides. The amounts of radioactivity in the monosaccharide peak were calculated and expressed as percent of total label retrieved after gel chromatography.RESULTSExperimental Strategy—Recombinant xlHAS1 or spHAS was incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcUA and UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, under conditions designed to yield HA chains with differentially labeled reducing terminal and non-reducing terminal domains. Predictions as to the distribution of the label in relation to the two alternative modes of chain elongation are based on the schemes in Fig. 1. The actual distribution of the label was assessed by digestion of the products with a mixture of β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, resulting in truncation of the HA chain strictly from the non-reducing end and release of monosaccharide products (19Longas M.O. Meyer K. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A HA chain initiated in the presence of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (and unlabeled UDP-GlcUA) and further elongated by incorporation also of [3H]-GlcUA units, would be 14C-labeled uniformly throughout, whereas the distribution of 3H label would depend on the mode of chain elongation (Fig. 1, Protocol 1). Elongation at the reducing terminus would yield a HA chain preferentially 3H-labeled in the reducing terminal domain, such that the monosaccharides released by exoglycosidase digestion would initially be exclusively 14C-labeled, then subsequently 3H as well as 14C-labeled. A progressive increase in the 3H/14C ratio of monosaccharide digestion products thus would be an indication of reducing terminal chain elongation in HA biosynthesis. Conversely, HA elongated at the non-reducing end would carry the 3H label primarily toward the non-reducing end of the chain, and yield monosaccharides of progressively decreasing 3H/14C ratio upon exolytic cleavage. Changing the experimental conditions to achieve continuous 3H labeling, and 14C incorporation only toward the end of incubation with UDP-sugar precursors (Fig. 1, Protocol 2), reverses all predictions from Protocol 1. A control with continuous incorporation of both isotopes was undertaken to ensure that under these conditions the 3H/14C ratio of all monosaccharide products would remain unchanged (Fig. 1, Protocol 3).Kinetics of HA Chain Elongation—Pilot experiments were performed to establish optimal conditions for the dual labeling protocol. At saturating substrate concentrations (Km for UDP-GlcUA = 190 ± 40 μm; Km for UDP-GlcNAc = 400 ± 100 μm), xlHAS1 incorporates ∼3 monosaccharide units/s into a nascent HA chain (20Pummill P.E. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19808-19814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). spHAS displays substrate affinities of the same order (Km for UDP-GlcUA = 40 ± 4 μm; Km for UDP-GlcNAc = 149 ± 3 μm (21Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). Prerequisite to our analytical approach, HA chains should be initiated and progressively elongated during the incubation period, with neither formation of unduly long chains nor significant initiation of additional new chains. The protocol finally selected involved subsaturating substrate concentrations (150 μm UDP-GlcNAc and 50 μm UDP-GlcUA). Gel chromatography of xlHAS1 polymer products generated under these conditions (label introduced through UDP-[3H]GlcUA) showed reasonably homogeneous populations of HA chains, growing from <20 kDa after 30 s of incubation to ∼40 kDa (∼200 monosaccharide units) within 2 min (Fig. 2A). HA produced by spHAS, at the same substrate concentrations, showed similar progressive elongation albeit at a lower rate, chains growing from <20 kDa after 4 min of incubation to ∼40 kDa after 10 min (Fig. 2B). The samples isolated after the longer incubation periods showed no significant initiation of new chains under these reaction conditions, irrespective of enzyme system.Fig. 2Effect of incubation time on HA chain size. xlHAS1 (A) and spHAS (B) were incubated with 150 μm UDP-GlcNAc and 50 μm UDP-[3H]GlcUA. HA chains isolated A, after 30s (•), 1 min (⋄), 1.5 min (▪), and 2 min (▵); or B, after 4 min (⋄), 6 min (▪) and 10 min (▵) of incubation were analyzed by gel chromatography on a Superose 6 column. The elution positions of heparin standards (6.6 and 20 kDa) are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation and Degradation of Differentially Labeled HA Chains—The xlHAS1 membranes were first incubated according to Protocol 1 (Fig. 1), with incorporation of [14C]GlcNAc throughout the incubation period, whereas [3H]GlcUA was available only during the second phase of HA chain elongation. The resulting products were isolated and subjected to graded exoglycosidase (β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase) digestion, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The digestion products were identified as [14C]GlcNAc and [3H]GlcUA monosaccharides by gel chromatography (Fig. 3) followed by paper chromatography (data not shown), as predicted. After 4 h of incubation with the exoglycosidases ∼25% of the total 14C and ∼32% of the 3H occurred in the monosaccharide peak. The progressive exoglycosidase action yielded monosaccharides of continuously decreasing 3H/14C ratios, from 2.1 after 30 min to 1.3 after 4 h of digestion (Table I and Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment (see supporting information, Table II). These data indicate that xlHAS1 adds sugar residues at the non-reducing end of HA chains (Fig. 1). Conversely, HA chains were generated according to Protocol 2, i.e. with continuous 3H labeling and 14C incorporation only during the final stage of chain elongation. The monosaccharides obtained upon enzymatic degradation of this sample showed increasing 3H/14C ratio with increasing exoglycosidase digestion time (Table I and Fig. 4). Again, a repeat experiment gave similar results (see supporting information, Table II). This finding, the reverse of that obtained with Protocol 1, again implicates the non-reducing terminus as the site of HA chain elongation (Fig. 1). The degradation products of a control experiment with the continuous presence of both labeled sugar precursors throughout the incubation with xlHAS1 (Protocol 3) yielded monosaccharides of a constant 3H/14C ratio during exoglycosidase digestion (Table I and Fig. 4A), in accord with prediction (Fig. 1).Fig. 3Exoglycosidase digestion of dual labeled HA chains. HA was synthesized by xlHAS1 in presence of 150 μm UDP-[14C]GlcNAc and 50 μm unlabeled UDP-GlcUA, followed by addition of 1 μm UDP-[3H]GlcUA, according to Protocol 1 (Fig. 1). Polymerization products were isolated and digested with a mixture of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and β-glucuronidase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The digests were analyzed by gel chromatography on a Superose 6 column, before incubation at 37 °C (A), after 30 min (B), 1 h (C), 2 h (D), 3 h (E), and 4 h (F) of digestion.

A, HA generated by xlHAS1; B, HA generated by spHAS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar experiments were performed with spHAS enzyme, but in this case, the initial exoglycosidase degradation products of HA obtained according to Protocol 1 (Fig. 1) were predominantly 14C-labeled. After 30 min of exoglycosidase incubation ∼23% of the total 14C but only ∼4% of the 3H occurred in the monosaccharide peak (Table I and Fig. 4B). After 5 h of digestion ∼38% of the total 14C and ∼28% of the 3H were released as monosaccharides. Gradual exoglycosidase action yielded monosaccharides of a continuously increasing 3H/14C ratio, from 0.2 after 30 min to 0.7 after 6 h of digestion (Table I and Fig. 4B). This change in ratio is opposite to that recorded in the corresponding experiment with xlHAS1 (Table I and Fig. 4A). Conversely, exoglycosidase digestion of HA generated according to Protocol 2 yielded monosaccharides of a progressively decreasing 3H/14C ratio (Table I and Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained in two independent series of experiments (see supporting information, Table II). Again, exoglycosidase degradation of HA isolated after continuous incorporation of both radioisotopes (Protocol 3) released monosaccharides of constant 3H/14C ratio. Taken together, these results strongly implicate the reducing end of HA as the site of chain elongation catalyzed by spHAS. We conclude that xlHAS1 and spHAS operate at the opposite ends of the polymeric product.DISCUSSIONThe current notion on HA biosynthesis, favoring elongation at the reducing end of the chain, is based on experiments performed more than 20 years ago (13Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In that previous study, teratocarcinoma cell membranes containing an endogenous HAS enzyme were pulse-labeled by incubation with UDP-[14C]GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc for 15 min, followed by a 15-min chase with unlabeled UDP-GlcUA. Conclusions regarding the elongation mechanism were based primarily on the rapid loss of label from the macromolecular HA product upon digestion with exoglycosidases. However, this observation would be compatible also with non-reducing terminal chain elongation, if the membrane-bound enzyme contained preformed, nascent HA chains that were completed already during the pulse period. Moreover, using the recombinant, but presumably related xlHAS1 enzyme, we were unable to establish appropriate chase conditions, i.e. to quench the incorporation of radiolabel into HA, by adding excess unlabeled UDP-GlcUA after the pulse-labeling period (data not shown). Similar objections may apply also to more recent experiments with HAS in a membrane fraction from a human glioma cell line (14Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In our present study these obstacles have been overcome by selective dual labeling of de novo initiated HA chains, generated by recombinant xlHAS1 or spHAS, using differentially radiolabeled UDP-sugar precursors. No significant initiation of novel chains occurred after the initial phase of incubation (Fig. 2). The problem of inefficient chasing was avoided by maintaining constant incorporation of one label throughout the incubation. The lack of endogenous HA chains in the enzyme preparation was ascertained by the use of S. cerevisiae, a yeast lacking the UDP-GlcUA precursor (17Pummill P.E. Achyuthan A.-M. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4976-4981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), to produce both recombinant synthases.The distribution of the label in HA synthesized by xlHAS1, as reflected by the 3H/14C ratio of monosaccharides released by exoglycosidases, clearly implicates a mechanism of chain elongation occurring at the non-reducing end of the polysaccharide. The generation of HA chains by xlHAS1 thus appears similar to the process catalyzed by the HA synthase from P. multocida (15DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and to the biosynthesis of proteoglycan constituents such as chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate (7Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Our conclusion is in agreement with recent studies of a truncated form of recombinant mammalian HAS2. This enzyme, contrary to the intact protein, was found to use exogenously supplied HA oligosaccharides as sugar acceptors in chain elongation reactions (16Hoshi H. Nakagawa H. Nishiguchi S. Iwata K. Niikura K. Monde K. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2341-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Acceptor capacity thus was demonstrated for a tetrasaccharide with an intact non-reducing terminal GlcUA residue, generated by the digestion of HA with testicular hyaluronidase. By contrast, a tetrasaccharide containing a 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid residue, generated by microbial lyase digestion, showed no acceptor activity. It was suggested that monosaccharide units were added at the non-reducing end of oligosaccharide acceptors.On the other hand, the application of the dual labeling protocols to HA biosynthesis catalyzed by the spHAS enzyme revealed an elongation mechanism involving the reducing terminus of the nascent chain. The mechanism of HA chain formation by spHAS thus appears similar to those described for a growing number of polysaccharides such as Salmonella O-antigen polysaccharide (22Robbins P.W. Wright A. Dankert M. Science. 1967; 158: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), bacterial cell murein (23Ward J.B. Perkins H. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and dextran (24Robyt J.F. Kimble B.K. Walseth T.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This finding concords also with the demonstration of the formation of a dynamic hyaluronan-UDP linkage during the synthesis of HA by HAS from Streptococcus equisimilis (25Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Weigel P.H. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 708Google Scholar). This synthase incubated with β-32P-labeled UDP-GlcNAc and cold UDP-GlcUA incorporated 32P into HA. When the synthase was further incubated in presence of excess unlabeled UDP-sugars the radiolabel was removed from HA implicating a mechanism of chain growth at the reducing end of the UDP-sugar acceptor.It is interesting that two HAS enzymes belonging to the same putative class, xlHAS1 and spHAS, differ in their mechanism of chain elongation, whereas the only member of class II, P. multocida HAS, adopts the same chain elongation process as two members of class I, xlHAS1, and human HAS2 (15DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Could this difference in polymerization mechanism be the result of independent evolution of the eukaryotic and streptococcal HAS genes? The central regions (∼200 residues) of the eukaryotic hyaluronan synthases are ∼25% completely identical in sequence to the spHAS. If this si"

Ezrin is phosphorylated on tyrosine, but a detailed picture of the signaling pathways involved in this modification is lacking. The transforming tyrosine kinase Src has various cytoskeletal substrates and is involved in regulation of cellular adhesion. We studied the role of Src in tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin in adherent cells. We show that ezrin is phosphorylated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in a Src family-dependent way. In SYF cells lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn, ezrin was not tyrosine-phosphorylated but reintroduction of wild-type Src followed by Src activation or introduction of active Src restored phosphorylation. Mapping of the Src-catalyzed tyrosine in vitro and in vivo by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated Tyr477 as the primary target residue. We generated a pTyr477-phosphospecific antibody, which confirmed that Tyr477 becomes phosphorylated in cells in a Src-dependent manner. Tyr477 phosphorylation did not affect ezrin head-to-tail association or phosphorylation of ezrin on threonine 566, indicating that the function of Tyr477 phosphorylation is not related to the intramolecular regulation of ezrin. A modified yeast two-hybrid screen in which ezrin bait was phosphorylated by Src identified a novel interaction with a kelch-repeat protein family member, KBTBD2 (Kelch-repeat and BTB/POZ domain containing 2). The Src dependence of the interaction was further verified by affinity precipitation assays.

Identification of a functional interplay with Src opens novel avenues for further characterization of the biological activities of ezrin. The Src family of transforming non-receptor tyrosine kinases is involved in cell adhesion, invasion, migration, cell cycle progression, and survival and is coupled to various receptor signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Thomas S.M.

Src also has a role in control of the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of Src by a complex mechanism leads to its translocation to plasma membrane and to association with detergent-insoluble protein fractions (4Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Src has various cytoskeletal substrates, and its activation induces rapid formation of lamellipodia or membrane ruffles. One of the linker proteins between cell surface receptors, especially adhesion molecules, and the actin cytoskeleton is ezrin, a member of the ERM 1The abbreviations used are: ERM, ezrin-radixin-moesin; WT, wild type; BTB/POZ domain, Broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brack/poxvirus and zinc-finger domain; KBTBD2, Kelch-repeat and BTB/POZ domain containing 2; N-ERMAD, N-terminal association domain; C-ERMAD, C-terminal association domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SFK, Src family kinase; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; HEK, human embryonic kidney; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CIP, calf-intestinal phosphatase.

Ezrin is typically localized to specialized membrane areas such as microvilli, membrane ruffles, or the uropods of polarized lymphocytes, and it possesses morphogenic functions in a variety of cell types. In addition to membrane proteins and F-actin, ezrin interacts with cellular signaling proteins of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase A and Rho signaling pathways (8Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and is thereby involved in the mechanisms of targeted signaling in cells. Several mechanisms regulate the functional activity and molecular interactions of ERM proteins. An intramolecular association between the N terminus (N-ERMAD, N-terminal association domain) and C terminus (C-ERMAD, C-terminal association domain) keeps the proteins inactive and masks their interaction sites for other molecules (9Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 10Bretscher A. Gary R. Berryman M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16830-16837Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Magendantz M. Henry M.D. Lander A. Solomon F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25324-25327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A key regulatory switch appears to be phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in the C-terminal domain. Phosphorylation of this residue results in dissociation of the intramolecular interaction and formation of monomers with morphogenic activity (12Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin are less well known. Ezrin is a major protein phosphorylated on tyrosine after epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation in A431 cells (13Gould K.L. Cooper J.A. Bretscher A. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin is also induced by platelet-derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor (15Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 16Fazioli F. Wong W.T. Ullrich S.J. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1335-1345PubMed Google Scholar). The major phosphorylated sites by the EGF and hepatocyte growth factor pathways have been mapped to Tyr145 in the N-terminal domain and Tyr353 in the α-helical region (15Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Krieg J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19258-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr353, which is not conserved in other ERM proteins, is required for the binding of the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to ezrin and for the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase Akt signaling pathway in LLC-PK1 cells (18Gautreau A. Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A defect in this signaling pathway due to a point mutation of Tyr353 to phenylalanine sensitizes cells to apoptosis. In addition, mutagenesis of both Tyr145 and Tyr353 in ezrin has been shown to disturb a morphogenic response to hepatocyte growth factor (15Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Early findings showed that ezrin tyrosine phosphorylation was increased in v-Src-induced cells (19Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We have shown that the Src family kinase (SFK) Lck catalyzes phosphorylation of Tyr145 in Jurkat T-cells (20Autero M. Heiska L. Rönnstrand L. Vaheri A. Gahmberg C.G. Carpén O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) activates Src kinases and leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin (21Wang L. Rudert W.A. Grishin A. Dombrosky-Ferlan P. Sullivan K. Deng X. Whitcomb D. Corey S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1426-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Also, cross-linking of ICAM-2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin and activation of the PKB/Akt pathway (22Perez O.D. Kinoshita S. Hitoshi Y. Payan D.G. Kitamura T. Nolan G.P. Lorens J.B. Immunity. 2002; 16: 51-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which is blocked by herbimycin A, a potent inhibitor of Src and pp62yes. Recently, it was reported that Src and ezrin act cooperatively in regulation of cell-cell contacts and scattering of mammary carcinoma cells (23Elliott B.E. Qiao H. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the relation of Src and ezrin is not known at molecular level and the Src target site in ezrin has not been characterized. We have studied the role of Src kinase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin in adherent cells and characterized a novel Src-dependent phosphorylation site, Tyr477. We show that, on one hand, phosphorylation at Tyr477 does not affect ezrin head-to-tail association and that, on the other hand, it is independent of ezrin threonine phosphorylation, which has been linked to conformational opening of the molecule. Moreover, we show that phosphorylation of ezrin by Src induces an association with a member of the kelch-repeat superfamily protein, KBTBD2 (Kelch-repeat and BTB/POZ domain containing 2). Cells and Antibodies—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293, ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium including 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells (ECACC, Salisbury, United Kingdom), SYF mouse embryonic fibroblasts from the triple Src knock-out mouse lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn SFKs (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and the add-back versions of the SYF cells, which have been introduced either with the wild-type c-Src gene or the constitutively active Y527F mutant Src (25Cary L.A. Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. J. A. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium including 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Phosphotyrosine was detected with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody clone PT-66 (Sigma). The polyclonal rabbit antibody Ez9 against ezrin has been described previously (26Alfthan K. Heiska L. Grönholm M. Renkema G.H. Carpén O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18559-18566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The VSVG-tag monoclonal antibody was from Roche Diagnostics (clone P5D4, Mannheim, Germany). Mouse IgG1 (Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) or rabbit preimmune serum were used as controls. Rabbit-phosphospecific antibodies against Src(pY418) and against ezrin-pThr566 (Tyr558 on moesin) were from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing human ezrin phosphorylated on Tyr477 was produced by BioSource International by immunization of a 6-mer synthetic phosphopeptide PV(pY)EPV and subsequent purification of the antiserum using both negative and positive affinity purification methods. Plasmids and Transfections—The recombinant GST-ezrin constructs encoding N-terminal (amino acids 1–309) and short C-terminal (amino acids 477–585) ezrin fusion proteins have been described previously (27Turunen O. Wahlström T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The α-helical (amino acids 296–468) and C-terminal (amino acids 309–585) sequences were amplified by PCR using human ezrin cDNA as template and cloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Mutations Y145F, Y353F, Y477F, Y482F, Y498F, and Y564F were introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) eukaryotic expression vector for cell transfections. The double mutant Y145F/Y477F was constructed from the two separate mutant cDNAs by conventional recombinant DNA techniques. GST fusion construct encoding full-length human KBTBD2 was cloned by PCR using the library clone IRAKp961E2391Q2 (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH, Berlin, Germany) as a template. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The C-terminal GST-merlin construct (amino acids 492–595) has been described previously (26Alfthan K. Heiska L. Grönholm M. Renkema G.H. Carpén O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18559-18566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The wild-type ezrin construct was a kind gift of Dr. M. Arpin (Institut Curie, Paris, France). The cDNAs of the constitutively activated Src containing Y529F mutation and the dominant negative kinase-dead Src K296R/Y528F in pUSEamp eukaryotic expression vector were from Upstate Biotechnology. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) and used 48 h after transfection. The amino acid numbering of ezrin is according to Krieg and Hunter (17Krieg J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19258-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Ezrin—The cells were lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 16000 × g for 10 min. Endogenous ezrin was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants with Ez9 antibody, and transfected proteins were precipitated with anti-VSVG followed by protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and finally suspended to Laemmli buffer. The immunoprecipitate was resolved on SDS-PAGE, blotted on nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies using ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). When needed, the cells were treated before lysis with 200 μm pervanadate for 15 min at 37 °C or with 200 ng/ml EGF (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 5 min at 37 °C. A431 cells were serum-starved for 16 h before treatments. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated with 10 μm PP2 (Calbiochem) for 10 min before and during pervanadate treatment. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Ezrin—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The GST portion of some of the fusion proteins was cleaved off by thrombin (Sigma). 2 μg of polypeptides were used for each reaction. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out in Src buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4) including 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 unit of recombinant human Src (Upstate Biotechnology) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling in reducing Laemmli buffer. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE, the gel was fixed and stained by Coomassie Blue, and dried and subjected to autoradiography. Affinity Pull-down Experiments—2 μg of the C-terminal GST-ezrin fusion protein (amino acids 309–585) were phosphorylated in 20 μl of Src buffer in the presence of 200 μm ATP (Sigma). Two samples were incubated with 1 unit of recombinant human Src, whereas one sample was incubated with no added enzyme for 30 min at 30 °C. In a scintillation analysis involving a trace amount of [γ-32P]ATP, the phosphorylation level of Src-phosphorylated samples was ∼12% total protein (data not shown). After reaction, 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA was added to the mixtures together with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The mixtures were incubated on a shaker for 1 h followed by extensive washes of the beads, first in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA and then three times in the calf-intestinal phosphatase (CIP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). In all of the washing steps during the experiments, 1 mm orthovanadate was included with the exception of the washes of one of the phosphorylated samples where orthovanadate was omitted in steps preceding the CIP treatment. The CIP reaction was preformed in 30 μl of the CIP buffer with 5 units of CIP (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) for 30 min at 37 °C. Other samples were incubated in the buffer with no added enzyme. Following reaction, the beads were extensively washed, once in the CIP buffer and three times in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Transfected cells were lysed in binding buffer, and the lysates were added on beads and incubated on a shaker for 2 h at 25 °C. Beads were washed in binding buffer four times and boiled in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer. 10 μl of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. GST-KBTBD2 was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, incubated with lysates of cells transfected with wild-type full-length or C-terminal ezrin (amino acids 306–585) treated or untreated with pervanadate, washed, and analyzed as described above. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and β-Galactosidase Filter Assay—The C-terminal ezrin cDNA encoding for amino acids 309–585 was introduced by PCR and conventional cloning to a modified yeast two-hybrid bait plasmid pBTM116Src, which also encodes for active Src from a separate transcript (28Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). The bait was used in screening of a human fetal brain library in pACT2 (Clontech). To verify the Src dependence of the interaction, each prey clone was tested in a mating assay (29Rönty M. Taivainen A. Moza M. Otey C.A. Carpén O. FEBS Lett. 2004; 566: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) against C-terminal ezrin bait in pBTM116Src vector or, as a control, in BTM116 without Src. The mated yeast cells expressing the bait and the prey plasmids were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the filter was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C on a wet Whatman filter moistened with Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg2SO4) including 0.7 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). Src Catalyzes Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Ezrin in Vivo— We previously demonstrated that ezrin is dynamically phosphorylated on tyrosine in T-lymphocytes by the Src family kinase Lck (20Autero M. Heiska L. Rönnstrand L. Vaheri A. Gahmberg C.G. Carpén O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To find out whether ezrin is a substrate of SFK also in adherent cells, we investigated the phosphorylation status of ezrin in HEK293 cells in which SFK activity was stimulated by pervanadate. Following stimulation, endogenous ezrin was immunoprecipitated and blotted with a phosphotyrosine antibody. To specify the role of SFK, we treated cells with the Src family-selective inhibitor PP2 (30Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar) before and during pervanadate stimulation. Immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates with an antibody recognizing active Src phosphorylated on Tyr418 confirmed that pervanadate treatment activated Src. As shown in Fig. 1, ezrin was tyrosine phosphorylated following pervanadate treatment and tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited if cells were preincubated with PP2. To provide further evidence for the involvement of Src kinase in ezrin phosphorylation, we used SYF embryonic fibroblast cells from the triple Src knock-out mouse lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn SFKs (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and the add-back versions of SYF cells reconstituted either with the wild-type c-Src gene or the constitutively activated Y527F mutant Src (25Cary L.A. Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When endogenous ezrin was immunoprecipitated from SYF or SYF/SrcWT cells, no phosphorylation was detected with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2A). On the contrary, in the SYF cells, which express the constitutively active mutant Src (SYF/Y527FSrc), ezrin was phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates with the antibody recognizing active (pY418)Src confirmed that only SYF/Y527FSrc cells contained active Src (Fig. 2A, right panel), whereas SYF/SrcWT expressed low levels of wild-type Src, which is not active in basal cell culture conditions (25Cary L.A. Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When SYF/SrcWT cells were treated with pervanadate, ezrin became tyrosine-phosphorylated, whereas pervanadate had no effect on SYF cells (Fig. 2B). These results confirm that Src kinase activity is explicitly involved in phosphorylation of ezrin. Mapping of the Phosphotyrosine Residue in Vitro—To map the tyrosine residue(s) phosphorylated by Src, we generated recombinant ezrin fragments fused with GST, produced them in E. coli, purified them, and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation reaction with recombinant Src kinase and [γ-33P]ATP. Previously identified ezrin phosphorylation sites, Tyr145 and Tyr353 (17Krieg J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19258-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were mutated to phenylalanine in some of the fusion peptides to directly analyze whether they are the target sites for Src. Autoradiographs of the reaction mixtures separated in SDS-PAGE showed that the C-terminal half of ezrin (amino acids 309–585) and a short C-terminal construct (amino acids 477–585) had incorporated 33P (Fig. 3A). The fusion proteins in which the previously identified phosphotyrosines were mutated did not differ from the corresponding wild-type fusion proteins. Interestingly, a C-terminal construct of merlin (amino acids 492–595), homologous to the short ezrin C-terminal construct, was not phosphorylated in a parallel experiment. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the short C-terminal construct revealed altogether four tyrosines, each of which was mutated to phenylalanine one by one and introduced into the GST fusion construct containing the C-terminal half of ezrin (amino acids 309–585). In vitro phosphorylation reaction of the mutated fusion proteins showed that mutation of Tyr477 but not the three other tyrosines abolished the phosphorylation induced by Src (Fig. 3B). The phosphorylation achieved a stoichiometry of 0.87 mol of phosphate/mol wild-type fusion protein (data not shown). These results indicate that Tyr477 is the major site of phosphorylation in vitro. Tyr477 Is the Major Src-catalyzed Phosphotyrosine in Vivo— To see whether Tyr477 is phosphorylated by Src also in vivo, ezrin expression plasmids carrying the Y477F mutation were constructed and introduced to HEK293 cells by transfection. VSVG-tagged wild-type and mutant ezrin from control or pervanadate-treated cells was immunoprecipitated with an anti-VSVG-tag antibody and phosphorylation was probed with anti-pTyr antibody. The expressed wild-type protein was readily phosphorylated after pervanadate treatment (Fig. 4). Interestingly, also the Y477F ezrin showed a low level of pTyr reactivity (<10% wild-type ezrin) after pervanadate treatment. To further characterize this remaining pTyr reactivity, we introduced a second mutation to the same expression construct, namely Y145F, because tyrosine 145 has been shown to be a phosphorylation target in ezrin (15Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Krieg J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19258-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Autero M. Heiska L. Rönnstrand L. Vaheri A. Gahmberg C.G. Carpén O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The double mutant Y145F/Y477F showed similar pTyr reactivity as ezrin-Y477F when the cells were stimulated with pervanadate (Fig. 4). The result indicated that Tyr477 is the major site of phosphorylation in ezrin during pervanadate treatment. To better study the phosphorylation of Tyr477in vivo, we generated a phosphospecific ezrin-Tyr477 antibody. Its specificity was characterized with several methods. The antibody recognized recombinant C-terminal ezrin only when the peptide was phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant Src. The reactivity was lost if the ezrin preparation was subsequently dephosphorylated by CIP (Fig. 5A). The anti-ezrin-pTyr477 antibody recognized immunoprecipitated wild-type ezrin after pervanadate treatment, whereas ezrin mutants Y477F or Y145F/Y477F were not recognized under similar conditions (Fig. 5B). Immunoblotting of 293 cell lysates containing endogenous or transfected wild-type ezrin demonstrated that the antibody recognized a band corresponding with the molecular size of ezrin, either after pervanadate treatment or in cells overexpressing Src. In contrast, when a kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of Src was overexpressed, no reactivity was detected. The reactivity of the antibody was abolished by preincubation with the antigenic phosphopeptide (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, pervanadate-treated lysates containing transfected Y145F or Y353F ezrin mutants reacted with the anti-ezrin-pTyr477 antibody, whereas the lysates expressing Y477F or Y145F/Y477F did not react (Fig. 5D). In conclusion, these results indicate that the antibody is indeed specific for ezrin-Tyr477 when phosphorylated by Src. Tyr477 Is phosphorylated in SYF/SrcY527F Cells—To see whether ezrin can be constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr477 in cells with up-regulated Src activity, we analyzed SYF cells and SYF/SrcWT and SYF/SrcY527F variants with anti-ezrin-pTyr477 antibody. In these experiments, the antibody reacted with ezrin in unstimulated SYF/SrcY527F cells (Fig. 5E). The result further verified that Tyr477 is a target for Src in these cells. Phosphorylation of Tyr477 and Thr566 Are Independently Regulated—Ezrin undergoes conformational regulation, which is dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr566. Previous studies have shown that T566D substitution renders ezrin in a constitutively active form (12Gautreau A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 31Fievet B.T. Gautreau A. Roy C. Del Maestro L. Mangeat P. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We wanted to analyze whether Tyr477 phosphorylation affects the phosphorylation level of Thr566. HEK293 cells were transfected with VSVG-tagged wild-type and Y477F mutant ezrin, and lysates of transfected or untransfected cells treated with pervanadate were probed with a phosphospecific antibody against phosphorylated Thr566 ezrin. Both forms of ezrin reacted with anti-pThr566 antibody at a similar level (Fig. 6A). The result suggests that Tyr477 phosphorylation does not promote Thr566 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Tyr477 Does Not Affect Ezrin Head-to-Tail Interaction—To find out the effect of ezrin Tyr477 phosphorylation on the intramolecular N-ERMAD to C-ERMAD association, we tested how tyrosine-phosphorylated ezrin self-associates in an affinity precipitation assay. The C-terminal ezrin GST fusion protein (amino acids 309–595) was either non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated in vitro with recombinant Src and bound to glutathione-Sepharose. One phosphorylated sample was further treated with CIP to verify the effect of phosphorylation on binding. Lysates of transfected cells expressing N-terminal ez"

In humans, loss of one functional ATP2C1 allele results in Hailey-Hailey disease (22Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C. Carter S. Ramser J. White J. Healy E. Dissanayake M. Larregue M. Perrussel M.

Affected individuals achieve normal development, fertility, and a normal life span but develop red blistering skin erosions attributable to defective cell adhesion of keratinocytes in the epidermis. Because the ATP2C1 gene product is thought to be ubiquitously expressed, it is unknown why the disease phenotype should be limited to keratinocytes. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA), knockdown of ATP2C1 in mammalian cells has been reported to inhibit calcium accumulation in the Golgi complex (24Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Raeymaekers L. Rizzuto R. Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and also, significantly, in the ER (25Mitchell K.J. Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, ATP2C1-related secretory pathway phenotypes have remained largely unexplored in mammalian cells. In this report, we examine endogenous ATP2C1 Ca2+ pump expression by immunofluorescence, the detection of which is markedly increased in cells incubated in low Ca2+ media. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATP2C1, we show that such cells exhibit defects in glycan processing of wild-type thyroglobulin (a secretory glycoprotein), ERAD of mutant thyroglobulin, and hypersensitivity to ER stress. These findings underscore an important role of ATP2C1 in secretory pathway homeostasis. Materials—MG115 was from Calbiochem; brefeldin A and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies have been described elsewhere (26Tokunaga F. Brostrom C. Koide T. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40757-40764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells—293, COS-7, NRK, FRT, and HaCat cells (kindly provided by Dr. G. Bokoch, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) and primary human fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml-100 μg/ml) except in Fig. 2 in which NRK cells and primary fibroblasts were cultured under serum-free conditions. Primary human keratinocytes were cultured in EpiLife supplemented with “human keratinocyte growth supplement” (cells and media from Cascade Biologics) at a calcium concentration of 0.09 mm. In preparation for experiments Ca2+ was supplemented to 1.25 mm in selected samples for 48 h before fixation and preparation for immunofluorescence. Transfection of 293 and FRT cells at ∼80% confluence was performed in individual wells of a 6-well plate using 2 μg of 3×HA (hemagglutinin)-rATP2C1 plasmid (below) and 4 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM for 4 h, and then the cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 12 h, after which it was replaced with fresh growth medium. Individual clones were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 and maintained with 400 μg/ml G418. Preparation of Anti-ATP2C1 Antibody—A cDNA (derived from GenBank™ accession number NM131907) encoding residues 369 to 475 of the rat ATP2C1 protein was subcloned into pGEX-3X, encoding a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein. (More than 40% of the residues in this sequence differ from that in the distinct rATP2C2 gene product (GenBank™ accession number NP604457)). After isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, bacterial lysates were purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Purified fusion protein was used as antigen, and three rabbit antisera (160, 161, and 304) were obtained. Of these, antiserum 161 yielded a better signal in identifying an ATP2C1-specific band in transfected COS-7 cells. Immunoglobulins from 161 were purified on protein A-agarose. Despite purification, antibody 161 could not reliably detect a strong signal of endogenous ATP2C1 by Western blotting, although it yielded a strong signal by immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence—In 24-well plates, cells seeded at 104 cells/well on 0.1% poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were grown for ∼2 days. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and blocked with 10% goat serum containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Coverslips were then incubated with rabbit anti-ATP2C1 antibody or mAb anti-HA (Covance), mAb anti-PDI (ABR), mAb anti-EEA1 (ABR), mAb anti-GM130 (BD Biosciences), or mAb anti-Golgi mannosidase II (from Dr. B. Burke, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). After washing, coverslips were incubated with Cy3- and Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and mounted (in Pro-Long, Molecular Probes). Epifluorescence images were captured with a CCD camera. 3×HA Tagging the rATP2C1 cDNA—To create a start codon and N-terminal 3×HA tag, a synthetic oligonucleotide primer was designed to include a HindIII site immediately preceding codon 8 of rATP2C1 (GenBank™ accession number NM131907), and a reverse primer including an EcoRI site was designed to begin at nucleotide 894 of the rATP2C1 sequence. The PCR product includes within it a unique ClaI site of rATP2C1. A 2449-bp ClaI fragment of the pMT SPCA vector was subcloned via the ClaI site to generate 3×HA-rATP2C1 in pCDNA3.1, encoding a 953-residue gene product in which 41 residues including the 3×HA tag replace the first 7 residues of rATP2C1. The final product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. ATP2C1 Complementation in pmr1 Yeast—A pmr1 yeast strain bearing disruption of PMR1 by eliminating a central XbaI-MstI fragment was employed (strain YR1234, W303 strain background, ade2–1; can1–100; his3–11,15; leu2–3,112; trp1–1; ura3–1; pmr1::LEU2). This strain was then transformed either with PMR1 on a URA3-marked centromeric plasmid or the URA3-marked empty pYES2 vector (bearing the GAL1 promoter) or pYES2 bearing the 3×HA-rATP2C1 insert. Transformants were tested for growth after 3 days at 30 °C on plates containing complete medium minus uracil with 2% galactose plus 2% ethanol and 10 mm EGTA. All strains in the study grew well on the same plates in the absence of calcium chelator. ATP2C1 Knockdown—A double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide target sequence for rATP2C1 was designed following the AA(N)19 rule (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar) and chosen from rATP2C1 positions 384–406: AAC CAT TAT GGA AGA AGT ACA TT. This sequence differs at four positions (bold letters) from that found in human ATP2C1: AGC CAC TGT GGA AGA AGT ATA TT. The double-stranded oligonucleotide (siRNA) for rATP2C1 was synthesized with and without a fluorescein isothiocyanate tag on the coding strand (Dharmacon). As a control, we also synthesized the scrambled double-stranded oligonucleotide CAC TAT GTG AGA AGA TAA ACA TT. Transfection of the siRNA (0.6 mm oligonucleotide) employed Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) diluted in Opti-MEM. Cells at 50–80% confluence were incubated with this mixture for 6 h at 37 °C and then supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 15 h. Cells were then washed and returned to the complete growth medium. By direct fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged oligoribonucleotides, a very high fraction of cells (>70%) incorporated the siRNA in these cell types (not shown). Thus, we did not routinely use fluorescence-activated cell sorting to separate cells bearing or lacking the siRNA. Pulse-Chase and Western Blotting—For pulse-chase experiments, control and siRNA-treated cells were preincubated for 30 min in Met/Cys-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. Labeling for 30 or 60 min employed Expre35S35S (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At various chase times, cells were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were precleared with 30 μl of zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and then primary antibody was added to the supernatant for overnight incubation at 4 °C and immunoprecipitation. When necessary, immunoprecipitates were diluted into endoglycosidase H denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs) and heated to 100 °C for 1 min. Zysorbin was then pelleted and the supernatant split in two equal portions to be either digested with 1,000 units of recombinant endo H (New England Biolabs) or mock-digested with buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, with or without endo H digestion, immunoprecipitates were solubilized in gel sample buffer and boiled before SDS-PAGE and fluorography or phosphorimaging. For mutant insulin, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed as described previously (28Liu M. Ramos-Castañeda J. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, cells lysates included complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). For detection of 3×HA-rATP2C1, gel samples were not boiled before SDS-PAGE (for all other purposes, samples were boiled). After transfer, nitrocellulose was blocked in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) plus 5% nonfat dried milk followed by incubation with primary antibody, including either mAb rat anti-HA (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, Roche Applied Science), goat anti-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, Research Diagnostics, Inc.), chicken anti-calreticulin (Affinity BioReagents), rabbit polyclonal anti-BiP (26Tokunaga F.

The nitrocellulose was washed and when necessary incubated with secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, or anti-chicken IgY; all horseradish peroxidase conjugates from Jackson ImmunoResearch) with bands detected by chemiluminescence. ER Stress Induction and Crystal Violet Staining—In 6-well plates, FRT cells without or with ATP2C1 knockdown were exposed to different concentrations of tunicamycin (Calbiochem) for 48 h, washed three times in PBS, and stained with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma) in 2% ethanol. Reverse Transcription-PCR for XBP-1—Briefly, after incubation with tunicamycin, 293s22 cells were washed twice with PBS, and total RNA was isolated with RNeasy (Qiagen). Forward 5′-CCT TGT AGT TGA GAA CCA GG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGG GCT TGG TAT ATA TGT GG-3′ (GenBank™ accession numbers AB076384 and AB076383) primers were used with 5 μl of cellular RNA suspension for reverse transcription-PCR using the one-step reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) kit. Reverse transcription was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min, and PCR was performed in 35 cycles, using 57 °C in the annealing step. After PCR, the synthesized products were resolved by 4% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Localization and Expression of the Endogenous ATP2C1 Protein—A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was prepared against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding residues 369–475 in a large cytoplasmic loop of the polytopic membrane protein encoded by ATP2C1 (Fig. 1, inset) (16Gunteski-Hamblin A.M. Clarke D.M. Shull G.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7600-7608Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Upon characterization of the antibody we found it most suitable for immunofluorescence studies, revealing a Golgi localization (i.e. selectively co-localizing with Golgi mannosidase II and redistributing to a pattern similar to that of ER-localized protein disulfide isomerase in brefeldin A-treated cells) as has been reported previously (17Ton V.K.

Acta. 2004; 1664: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to examine endogenous expression of ATP2C1 in keratinocytes relative to other cells, as patients with ATP2C1 haploinsufficiency exhibit a keratinocyte cell adhesion defect (32Bernards M. Korge B.P. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1058-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells maintained in serum-free medium (as is standard for keratinocyte cultures) were examined after a 2-day exposure to calcium added to a level of 1.25 or 0.09 mm (the latter also standard for primary keratinocyte cultures). Primary human keratinocytes had very bright immunofluorescent expression of the ATP2C1 gene product in comparison with other cells, and addition of 1.25 mm Ca2+ to the culture medium markedly decreased this (Fig. 2). A low-calcium, serum-free culture environment is more challenging for growth of other cell types; nevertheless, similar behavior was also observed in primary human fibroblast cultures and NRK cells under these conditions. HaCat keratinocyte cell cultures grow in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (free Ca2+ ∼0.09 mm), and in these too, the addition of 1.25 mm calcium provoked loss of immunofluorescent ATP2C1 expression (whereas Golgi GM130 expression persisted). Together these results indicate an especially robust expression of the ATP2C1 gene product in nonmutant keratinocytes as well as a clear relationship between calcium availability and immunofluorescent ATP2C1 expression. Expression of Epitope-tagged Rat ATP2C1—To follow more sensitively the ATP2C1 gene product by Western blotting or immunoprecipitation, we constructed a rat ATP2C1 cDNA that encoded an N-terminal 3×HA epitope tag (i.e. 3×HA-rATP2C1). To establish that the tagged construct is functional, a yeast GAL1 promoter was subcloned behind the 3×HA-rATP2C1 cDNA, which was transformed into pmr1 yeast. When transformed only with the empty high copy vector (pYES2), pmr1 cells are unable to grow on an EGTA plate; this phenotype is complemented by expressing PMR1 on a plasmid as demonstrated previously (14Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Moreover, in multiple independent transformants in which 3×HA-rATP2C1 was expressed from the pYES2 vector, pmr1 cell growth on an EGTA plate was rescued (Fig. 3); similar rescue was observed by rATP2C1 without the HA epitope tag (not shown). Although not quantitatively assessing enzyme function, these crude complementation experiments clearly established that 3×HA-rATP2C1 encodes a bioactive protein. When the 3×HA-rATP2C1 construct was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, the anti-HA immunofluorescence was confined to a juxtanuclear compartment, which co-localized with the endogenous ATP2C1 gene product in transiently transfected 293 cells (Fig. 4, upper panels) as well as in stably transfected 293s22 cells in which anti-HA immunofluorescence co-localized with Golgi mannosidase II and GM130 (Fig. 4, lower panels). Thus, the epitope-tagged rATP2C1 construct both functions and is localized normally in mammalian cells.Fig. 4Expression of 3×HA-rATP2C1 in mammalian cells.Above the line, 293 cells were transiently transfected and then processed for immunofluorescence with anti-HA. DAPI was used to stain nuclei. All cells are positive for endogenous expression of ATP2C1, but only transfected cells are positive for anti-HA, which yields an identical intracellular distribution to that of the endogenous ATP2C1 gene product. Below the line, a stable G418-resistant clone of 293 cells (293s22) was generated. The immunofluorescent distribution with anti-HA matches that of the Golgi markers mannosidase II (Mann-II) and GM130. The merged panels include DAPI stains of nuclei.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Knockdown of Rat ATP2C1 and Human ATP2C1 Expression—For knockdown of ATP2C1 protein expression, we selected a synthetic 21-mer oligoribonucleotide duplex (corresponding to nucleotides 385–408 of the rat ATP2C1 coding sequence). We proceeded to test the siRNA duplex in either rat-derived FRT cells, human-derived 293 cells, or the 293s22 clone that stably expresses 3×HA-rATP2C1. The siRNA was not expected to have an impact in the 293 cells (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar) because the human mRNA in this region differs at four positions from that found in rodents (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nevertheless, because of the 100% identity that exists along many stretches shared between the rat and human mRNA sequences (overall 97% identity), we were curious as to the possibility that 293s22 cells made to express rATP2C1 would be rendered susceptible to knockdown of total ATP2C1 (endogenous hATP2C1 as well as rATP2C1 after siRNA treatment (33Timmons L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). Five days after siRNA treatment of FRT cells, we observed a dramatic loss of immunofluorescence expression of the rATP2C1 gene product (Fig. 5, upper left panels). By immunoblotting with anti-HA in FRT or 293s22 cells, we also observed profound knockdown of rATP2C1 at 2 days, 5 days, or 8 days post-siRNA treatment (Fig. 5, upper right). Control 293 cells that had not been transfected to express rATP2C1 were not susceptible to knockdown of endogenous hATP2C1, which showed a normal distribution in the Golgi complex (Fig. 5, lower left panel). However in 293s22 cells, although GM130 remained properly localized (Fig. 5, lower middle) as did Golgi mannosidase II (not shown), anti-HA immunofluorescence was rendered virtually undetectable (lower right), and the endogenous hATP2C1 gene product could no longer be detected as well (lower middle and right). Although the extent to which hATP2C1-specific mRNA fragments might be generated by dicer activity upon treatment of 293s22 cells with rATP2C1-specific siRNA is unknown, the utility of the above finding is that the persistence of hATP2C1 expression in control 293 cells provides an outstanding control for specificity of siRNA effects in 293 cells. (Independent controls comprised of no oligoribonucleotide, single-stranded oligoribonucleotide, or scrambled duplex oligoribonucleotide sequence all worked successfully as controls as well.) Effects of ATP2C1 on Post-translational Modifications Including Acquisition of Endoglycosidase H Resistance and Sorting in the Golgi Complex—In addition to pumping Ca2+, ATP2C1 pumps Mn2+ (17Ton V.K.

https://openalex.org/W2026222185,"3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, statins, are widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs and have been shown to have anticancer effects in many models. We have investigated the effect of statins on Mdm2, a p53-specific ubiquitin ligase. It was found that pravastatin induced Mdm2 phosphorylation at Ser166 and at 2A10 antibody-specific epitopes in HepG2 cells, while mRNA levels were unchanged. Furthermore, pravastatin was found to induce phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448. Ser166 phosphorylation of Mdm2 was abrogated by an inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin, but not by the PI3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. Ser166 phosphorylation of Mdm2 has been associated to active Mdm2 and has been shown to increase its ubiquitin ligase activity and lead to increased p53 degradation. Our data show that statins attenuated the p53 response to DNA damage. Thus, in HepG2 cells pravastatin and simvastatin pretreatment attenuated the p53 response to DNA damage induced by 5-fluorouracil and benzo(a)pyrene. Similar attenuation was induced when p53 stabilization was induced by the inhibitor of nuclear export, leptomycin B. Furthermore, in the DNA-damaged cells, half-lives of Mdm2 and p53 were decreased by statins, indicating a more rapid formation of p53/Mdm2 complexes and facilitated p53 degradation. The induction of p53 responsive genes and apoptosis was attenuated. Mdm2 and p53 were also studied in vivo in rat liver employing immunohistochemistry, and it was found that constitutive Mdm2 expression was changed in livers of pravastatin-treated rats. We also show that the p53 response to a challenging dose of diethylnitrosamine was attenuated in hepatocytes in situ and in primary cultures of hepatocytes by pravastatin pretreatment. Taken together, these data indicate that statins induce an mTOR-dependent Ser166 phosphorylation of Mdm2, and this effect may attenuate the duration and intensity of the p53 response to DNA damage in hepatocytes."

Dendrites can be distinguished from the axon by the presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The mechanism by which the structure and distribution of the RER is maintained in these cells is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of the dendritic microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) in the RER membrane positioning by comparing their distribution in brain subcellular fractions and in primary hippocampal cells and by examining the MAP2-microtubule interaction with RER membranes in vitro. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain revealed a high MAP2 content in a subfraction enriched with the endoplasmic reticulum markers ribophorin and p63.

In cultured hippocampal neurons, MAP2 and p63 were found to concomitantly compartmentalize to the dendritic processes during neuronal differentiation. Protein blot overlays using purified MAP2c protein revealed its interaction with p63, and immunoprecipitation experiments performed in HeLa cells showed that this interaction involves the projection domain of MAP2. In an in vitro reconstitution assay, MAP2-containing microtubules were observed to bind to RER membranes in contrast to microtubules containing tau, the axonal MAP. This binding of MAP2c microtubules was reduced when an anti-p63 antibody was added to the assay.

The cytoskeletal elements are also distinctly distributed in these neuronal compartments; the number of microtubules is higher in dendrites than in the axon, whereas the opposite is noted for neurofilaments (1Bartlett W.P.

Notably, the microtubules of dendrites and axon contain different microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs); the microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) is found in dendrites, whereas tau is present only in the axon (6Hirokawa N.

The contribution of these MAPs to the establishment of neuronal polarity has been well documented.

Despite the fact that MAP2 and tau are known to induce microtubule formation in neurons, their precise role in the elaboration of dendrites and axon remains elusive. Each of these proteins presents different isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing. Splicing events occur in the microtubule-binding domain that is confined to three or four imperfect repeated domains of 18 amino acids located in the C terminus and in the projection domain that extends at the surface of the microtubules (14Sanchez C. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 133-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 15Buee L. Bussiere T. Buee-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The latter domain, the projection domain, regulates the spacing between microtubules (16Chen J. Kanai Y. Cowan N.J. Hirokawa N.

MAP2 and tau share sequence homology in the microtubule-binding domain and in the adjacent proline-rich region located between the projection domain and the microtubule-binding domain (19Lewis S.A.

The presence of a distinct class of MAPs in dendrites and axon suggests that these proteins may have another function than the stabilization of microtubules. Consistent with this hypothesis, microtubule formation by MAP2 and tau is not sufficient to induce process outgrowth in Sf9 cells (17Belanger D. Farah C.A. Nguyen M.D. Lauzon M. Cornibert S. Leclerc N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1523-1539PubMed Google Scholar, 18Leclerc N. Baas P.W. Garner C.C. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol.

Indeed, MAP2b promoted the formation of microtubules in these cells, but only 7% of the MAP2b-expressing cells developed processes. Thus, the stabilization of microtubules does not seem to be the sole function of MAP2 in dendritic outgrowth. In recent years, our work and that of others (23Cunningham C. Leclerc N. Flanagan L.

Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2769-2779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that MAP2 could also interact with actin microfilaments and neurofilaments. Thus, MAP2 could act as a cytoskeletal integrator in dendrites by linking together the three cytoskeletal elements. This role remains to be characterized. Besides interacting with the three constituents of the neuronal cytoskeleton, MAP2 can also interact with signaling proteins. For example, MAP2 can interact with the regulatory subunit RII of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (30Rubino H.M. Dammerman M. Shafit-Zagardo B. Erlichman J. Neuron. 1989; 3: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In MAP2 knock-out mice, there is a reduction of total cAMP-dependent protein kinase in dendrites, and the rate of induction of phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein is reduced after forskolin stimulation (31Harada A. Teng J. Takei Y. Oguchi K. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These events were accompanied by a decrease of dendritic elongation. From these data, one can conclude that MAP2 plays an important role in the polarized distribution of signaling proteins that regulate dendritic differentiation and plasticity. In a recent study (32Farah C.A. Nguyen M.D. Julien J.P. Leclerc N. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we reported that MAP2 was found in a crude membrane preparation from mouse spinal cord homogenate, suggesting that MAP2 could be associated with membranous organelles. In recent years, families of proteins called CLIPs and Hooks were shown to mediate the interaction between microtubules and membranous organelles (33Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 34De Zeeuw C.I. Hoogenraad C.C. Goedknegt E. Hertzberg E. Neubauer A. Grosveld F. Galjart N.

Most interestingly, CLIP-115 was found to be responsible for the polarized distribution of a membranous organelle exclusively present in dendrites termed the dendritic lamellar bodies (34De Zeeuw C.I.

Until now, no microtubule-associated protein has been identified that contributes to the dendritic distribution of RER membranes. Our present data indicate that MAP2 could play such a role. Here we report a novel association of MAP2 with RER membranes using subcellular fractionation, electron microscopy immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy in an in vitro reconstitution assay. Moreover, we showed that this association involves the interaction of the MAP2 projection domain with a 63-kDa nonglycosylated type II integral RER membrane protein, termed p63, that was found to mediate the interaction between RER membranes and microtubules in a previous study (37Schweizer A.

Taken together, our results suggest that the interaction between MAP2 and p63 might contribute to the preferential distribution of RER membranes in the dendritic processes. Preparation of a Fraction Enriched in Rough Microsomes (RM) Using Sucrose Gradient—Animals were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The use of animals and all surgical procedures described in this article were carried out according to The Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Brains were dissected from 20 Sprague-Dawley adult rats, and the protocol described previously by Lavoie et al. (40Lavoie C. Lanoix J. Kan F.W. Paiement J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1415-1425PubMed Google Scholar) was used to separate rough microsomes and Golgi elements from total microsomes. A schematic of the protocol is shown in Fig. 1A. Briefly, total microsomes were isolated by differential centrifugation, and ER and Golgi elements were subsequently purified by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose step gradient. Immunoblot Analyses—Protein assay was performed (Bio-Rad kit). Equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane and electrophoresed in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Following separation, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose strips were incubated with the primary antibodies for 90 min at room temperature. They were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were again washed and then revealed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: the monoclonal antibody anti-MAP2 (clone HM2, Sigma), the monoclonal antibody anti-tau (clone Tau-5, Oncogene Research Products, San Diego), the monoclonal antibody anti-α-tubulin (clone DM 1A, Sigma), a polyclonal antibody against ribophorin II, a polyclonal and a monoclonal antibody against p63 (kindly provided by Dr. H. P. Hauri, University of Basel, Switzerland), a polyclonal antibody against Porin (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego), a polyclonal antibody against mannosidase II (kindly provided by Dr. M. G. Farquhar, University of California, San Diego), and a polyclonal against NaK-ATPase (kindly provided by Dr. D. Fambrough, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore). Electron Microscopy—Microsomes isolated from brain were fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde, recovered onto Millipore membranes by the random filtration technique of Baudhuin et al. (41Baudhuin P. Evrard P. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and processed for electron microscopy as described previously (40Lavoie C. Lanoix J. Kan F.W. Paiement J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1415-1425PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-embedding Electron Microscope Immunocytochemistry—Immunolocalization of HM2 was modified from that used previously by Dominguez et al. (42Dominguez J.M. Lanoix J. Paiement J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). 200 μg of the RM fraction were resuspended in 10% normal goat serum/saline (0.9% NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) solution containing the primary antibody. The monoclonal HM2 antibody was used at a concentration of 1:200. The incubation was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. RM were then fixed for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.05% glutaraldehyde solution and recovered onto Millipore membranes by the filtration technique of Baudhuin et al. (41Baudhuin P. Evrard P. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Membranes were then washed with saline solution, blocked in 1% ovalbumin/PBS solution for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with the anti-mouse IgG-colloidal gold solution (Sigma, 1:10) diluted in 0.02% polyethylene glycol/saline for 60 min. Following the washing steps, membranes were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C overnight and processed for electron microscopy as described above. Primary Hippocampal Cultures—Primary embryonic hippocampal cultures were prepared from18-day-old rat fetuses as described previously (43Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-281Google Scholar). After removal of meninges, hippocampi were treated with trypsin (0.25% at 37 °C for 15 min), then washed in Hanks' balanced solution, and dissociated by several passages through a constricted Pasteur pipette. The cells were then plated on glass coverslips coated with polylysine. Cells were plated at 200,000 cells per 60-mm Petri dishes. Then after 4 h to allow the attachment of the cells to the substrate, the hippocampal cells were transferred either in a serum-free B-27-supplemented neurobasal medium or in N2-supplemented medium. Immunofluorescence—Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 45 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The MAP2 protein was revealed using a monoclonal antibody directed against MAP2 (clone HM2, dilution 1:200) purchased from Sigma or the rabbit polyclonal anti-MAP2 (1: 2000) (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Vallée, Columbia University, New York). The endoplasmic reticulum was revealed using the A1/59 monoclonal anti-p63 (1:100) (kindly provided by Dr. H. P. Hauri, University of Basel, Switzerland). To visualize tau protein, a rabbit polyclonal anti-tau antibody was used at a concentration of 1:750 (kindly provided by Dr. Virginia M-Y Lee, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). Microtubules were revealed by using a rat polyclonal antibody directed against α-tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). We used the following secondary antibodies: a donkey anti-mouse conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (dilution 1:100), a donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to rhodamine (1:500); and an Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rat (1:400) or an AMCA anti-rat (1:300). All these secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Bio/Cam, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). These antibodies were diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted in polyvinyl alcohol (Calbiochem). Fluorescently labeled cells were visualized with a Leica TCS-SP1 confocal microscope using ×63 or ×100 objectives or a Zeiss Axioplant fluorescence microscope using ×20 or ×40 objectives. GFP-MAP2 Fusion Proteins—Rat MAP2c cDNA were inserted in the expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The polylinker of this expression vector was modified, and three cloning sites, BamHI, ScaI, and NotI were inserted by annealing of the oligonucleotides on 5′-TCGAGGGATCCAGTACTGCGGCCGCTTAATTAA-3′ and 5′-CCCTAGGTCATGACGCCGGCGAATTAATTCTAG-3′. Then the annealed sequence was ligated into the vector pEGFP-C1 at the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites. Then the full-length cDNA coding for MAP2c was excised, with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes, from the BacPAK-HIS2 vector described previously (17Belanger D. Farah C.A. Nguyen M.D. Lauzon M. Cornibert S. Leclerc N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1523-1539PubMed Google Scholar). The GFP tag was fused to the MAP2c sequence at its N terminus. Deleted mutants corresponding to the projection domain of MAP2c (Proc: nucleotides 1–444) and to the microtubule-binding domain (Mt: nucleotides 442–1551) were generated. These mutants were inserted in the vector pEGFP-C1. The pEGFP-C1 Tau4R plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Ken Kosik (44Lu M. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transfection of Primary Hippocampal Neurons—After 7 days in culture, hippocampal neurons were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate transfection protocol (45Micheva K.D. Holz R.W. Smith S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were transferred in a 6-well plate. The calcium and DNA precipitate was generated 30 min before transfection by mixing dropwise 4 μg of Qiagen-purified DNA in 60 μl of 250 mm CaCl2 per well with an equal volume of 2× HBS (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm glucose, 42 mm HEPES, pH 7.07). Cells were incubated with transfection precipitate for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and retransferred in the original Petri dishes containing the glial monolayer and the N2 serum-free medium. Protein expression was allowed to proceed for 24 h. The cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. MAP2c and Tau Purification from Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL 1711; Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Grace's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) as a monolayer at 27 °C. For protein purification, Sf9 cells were grown as a suspension to obtain a final concentration of 1.5 × 106 cells/200 ml total media volume and were then infected with MAP2c or tau viral stocks (17Belanger D. Farah C.A. Nguyen M.D. Lauzon M. Cornibert S. Leclerc N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1523-1539PubMed Google Scholar, 22Knops J. Kosik K.S. Lee G. Pardee J.D. Cohen-Gould L. McConlogue L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Infection was allowed to proceed for 48–72 h before the cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g. The cell pellet was kept at -80 °C until protein purification. Protein purification was performed using the boiling preparation method as described previously (46Hernandez M.A. Avila J. Andreu J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Overlay Assay—A fraction enriched in proteins of RM was prepared from rat liver as described previously (40Lavoie C. Lanoix J. Kan F.W. Paiement J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1415-1425PubMed Google Scholar). RM proteins from rat liver were separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Following separation, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the overlay buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween. The membrane was then incubated, overnight at 4 °C, in 500 μl of the overlay buffer plus 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 10 μg of the purified MAP2c. The following day, after two washes in TBS/Tween (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated for 1 h 30 min in the overlay buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with the monoclonal anti-MAP2 clone HM2 (1:1000) to detect the interactions of MAP2 with RM proteins. This was followed by an incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). To reveal proteins, an ECL detection kit was used (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation—Adult or immature embryonic (E19) or neonatal (P0) Sprague-Dawley rat brain were dissected and homogenized in the immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Na3VO4,50mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1% IGEPAL and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenate was sonicated for 5 s at an amplitude of 6% and then centrifuged for 20 min at 13,500 × g. The supernatant was used for the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The monoclonal anti-MAP2 (clone HM2) or the polyclonal anti-p63 antibody was added to 1 ml of the supernatant and incubated overnight on a rocking platform at 4 °C. 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were then added to the immunoprecipitates, and incubation was allowed to proceed for1hat4 °C. After a short spin at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed six times with 1 ml of cold IP buffer. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The protein A-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gel. Cell Culture and Protein Expression—HeLa cells (ATCC CRL CCL-2, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfection, HeLa cells were plated in 35-mm Petri dishes and grown overnight to ∼80% confluency. Cells were then transiently transfected using the PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a mixture of 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA, 15 μl of PolyFect reagent, and 100 μl of DMEM were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and 600 μl of cell culture media was then added to the complex. Cells were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated with the DNA-PolyFect complex. The expression was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 37 °C. The following day, after two washes with cold PBS, transfected HeLa cells were scraped into 1 ml of IP buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h to lyse the cells. The lysate was sonicated for 5 s at an amplitude of 6%, passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used to perform co-immunoprecipitation as described above. To immunoprecipitate the full-length GFP-MAP2c fusion protein and the truncated form GFP-Proc, either the monoclonal anti-MAP2 clone HM2 (1:250) or the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Diagnostics) was used. To immunoprecipitate GFP-Mt protein or the GFP-tau 4R protein, the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Diagnostics) was used at a concentration of 1:100. Negative Staining for Electron Microscopy—Tubulin (2 mg/ml) was allowed to polymerize in the presence of MAP2c or tau protein (0.5 mg/ml) in the G-PEM buffer for 35 min at 37 °C. Microtubules were then added to a freshly prepared nuclear fraction from rat liver, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for 30 min. To monitor the presence of microtubules in this preparation, 5 μl of the supernatant were placed on a carbon-coated Formvar-supported EM grid. After an incubation of 30 s, the grid was rinsed with distilled water and stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 30 s. Samples were visualized with a Zeiss CM 902 transmission electron microscope. Preparation of Nuclear Fractions—Nuclear fractions were prepared from rat liver homogenates (1:2, w/v) in 0.25 m sucrose, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.025 m KCl, and 0.005 m MgCl2 (0.25 m sucrose-TKM) using the procedure of Blobel and Potter (47Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The isolated nuclei were resuspended in cold 0.25 m sucrose-TKM and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. Nuclei from 10 ml of homogenate were resuspended by gentle stirring with a glass rod in 1.2 ml of G-PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA to which 1 mm GTP was added prior to use). To detect p63 protein, the nuclear fraction was treated with DNase according to a protocol described previously (48Dwyer N. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 70: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) to get an enrichment of nuclear membranes. In Vitro Microtubule-Membrane Reconstitution—An in vitro microtubule-membrane reconstitution assay was modified from that described previously (4"
https://openalex.org/W2017067293,"In tumors, caveolin-1, the structural protein of caveolae, constitutes a key switch through its function as a tumor suppressor and a promoter of metastases. In endothelial cells (EC), caveolin is also known to directly interact with the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and thereby to modulate nitric oxide (NO)-mediated processes including vasodilation and angiogenesis. In this study, we examined whether the modulation of the stoichiometry of the caveolin/eNOS complex in EC lining tumor blood vessels could affect the tumor vasculature and consecutively tumor growth. For this purpose, we used cationic lipids, which are delivery systems effective at targeting tumor vs. normal vascular networks. We first documented that in vitro caveolin transfection led to the inhibition of both VEGF-induced EC migration and tube formation on Matrigel. The DNA-lipocomplex was then administered through the tail vein of tumor-bearing mice. The direct interaction between recombinant caveolin and native eNOS was validated in coimmunoprecipitation experiments from tumor extracts. A dramatic tumor growth delay was observed in mice transfected with caveolin- vs. sham-transfected animals. Using laser Doppler imaging and microprobes, we found that in the early time after lipofection (e.g., when macroscopic effects on the integrity of the tumor vasculature were not detectable), caveolin expression impaired NO-dependent tumor blood flow. At later stages post-transfection, a decrease in tumor microvessel density in the central core of caveolin-transfected tumors was also documented. In conclusion, our study reveals that by exploiting the exquisite regulatory interaction between eNOS and caveolin and the propensity of cationic lipids to target EC lining tumor blood vessels, caveolin plasmid delivery appears to be a safe and efficient way to block neoangiogenesis and vascular function in solid tumors, independently of any direct effects on tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2131130040,"Intranigral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inductor of inflammation, induces degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, along with an inflammatory process that features activation of microglial cells and loss of astrocytes. To test the involvement of dopamine (DA) in this degeneration induced by LPS, we treated albino Wistar rats with different concentrations of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity. Results showed that alpha-MPT prevented LPS-induced loss of TH immunostaining and expression of mRNA for TH and DA transporter; it also prevented substantial activation of microglial cells. Loss of the astroglial population, a marker of damage in our model, was also prevented. This protective effect resulted from inhibition of TH and the consequent decrease in DA concentration, because treatment with L-DOPA/benserazide, which bypasses TH inhibition induced by alpha-MPT, reversed the protective effect produced by this drug. These results point out the important contribution of DA to the vulnerability and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Knowledge about the involvement of DA in this process may lead to the possibility of new protection strategies against this important degenerative process."
https://openalex.org/W1971464824,"There is great medical need to develop novel therapies for treatment of human hepatitis C virus (HCV). By gene expression analysis of three HCV-subgenomic RNA replicon cell lines, we identified cellular proteins whose expression is affected by the presence of HCV and therefore may serve as drug targets. Data from cDNA array filter hybridization, as well as from Northern and Western blotting, revealed that the gastrointestinal-glutathione peroxidase (GI-GPx) was drastically down-regulated (up to 20-fold) in all replicon cell lines tested. Concomitantly, total cellular glutathione peroxidase activity was drastically reduced, which rendered these human liver cells more susceptible toward oxidative stress. Interferon α caused down-regulation of the HCV-replicon followed by recovery of GI-GPx expression to nearly normal levels. Furthermore, expression of GI-GPx in replicon cells by gene transduction caused down-regulation of HCV RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, activating the endogenous gene coding for GI-GPx by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) was sufficient to cause down-regulation of the HCV replicon. A small interfering RNA duplex abrogated GI-GPx up-regulation by RA and concomitantly suppression of HCV. The RA effect was dependent on the presence of sodium selenite, was reversible, and was independent of RNA-activated protein kinase. Taken together, these results show that HCV inhibits the expression of GI-GPx in replicon cells to promote its intracellular propagation. Modulation of GI-GPx activity may open new avenues of treatment for HCV patients. There is great medical need to develop novel therapies for treatment of human hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Lancet. 1998; 351: 351-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and more than 80% of these patients become chronically infected causing recurring hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and cancer. HCV-related end-stage liver disease is now the leading reason for liver transplantation. Interferon (IFN) monotherapy is effective in only 10% of HCV patients (2Bodenheimer H.C. Lindsay K.L.

Hepatology. 1997; 26: S15-S20Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin can eradicate the virus in about 50% of patients (reviewed in Ref. 5Poynard P. Man-Fung Y. Ratziu V. Lai C.L. Lancet. 2003; 362: 2095-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of ribavirin has not been fully determined, but incorporation of ribavirin triphosphate into the HCV genome seems to induce error-prone replication to a nontolerable mutation rate (6Lanford R.E. Chavez D. Guerra B. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. Brasky K.M. Beames B.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Binding of IFNα/β leads to the dimerization of the respective receptors and activation of the Jak/STAT pathway, which turns on cellular genes known to be involved in antiviral responses (7Koul A. Herget T. Klebl B. Ullrich A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Among these are the Mx proteins, major histocompatibility antigens, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthase, and the double-stranded RNA-specific protein kinase (PKR). The precise mechanisms by which HCV can resist the IFN response is not fully understood, but viral proteins E2 and NS5a seem to play a role in evasion of the cellular defense system by blocking PKR (reviewed in Ref. 8Tan S.-L. Pause A. Shi Y. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 867-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Molecular studies on HCV-host cell interaction have been hampered by the lack of small animal model systems (reviewed in Ref. 9Klebl B.M. Kurtenbach A. Salassidis K. Daub H. Herget T. Antivir. Chem. Chemother. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome these limitations, a human hepatoma cell line (HuH7) was transfected with subgenomic HCV RNAs, called replicons (Fig. 1A) (10Lohmann V. Körner F. Koch J.O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines containing high levels of replicon RNA and viral proteins proved useful to study HCV replication as well as translation and processing of HCV proteins present in the system (10Lohmann V. Körner F. Koch J.O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar, 11Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Rutter G. Kurpanek K.

To examine the influence of the HCV replicon on the cellular transcription, we utilized microarray technology. Differential hybridization of more than 400 cDNAs with probes derived from RNA of mock- and replicon-transfected HuH7 cell lines resulted in the identification of several de-regulated genes. In the present study we focus on the analysis of the gastrointestinal-glutathione peroxidase (GI-GPx) gene, whose mRNA was down-regulated in the replicon cell lines up to 20-fold compared with control cell lines. GI-GPx is one of four selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases, and its expression in rodents appears to be restricted to the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract (13Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas in humans it is also found in liver (14Chu F.F. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2571-2576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidases are functioning primarily to counteract oxidative attack but also play roles in signaling (reviewed in Refs. 15Brigelius-Flohé R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar and 16Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. Biofactors. 2003; 17: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, are produced during aerobic metabolism. Glutathione peroxidases, along with superoxide dismutases and catalases, are considered the main antioxidant enzymes to encounter oxidative stress, which can cause severe cell damage (17Evans M.D. Griffiths H.R. Lunec J. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 20: 25-73Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Selenoproteins like GPx incorporate selenocysteine (Sec) co-translationally into the polypeptide chain by a complex mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 18Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar and 19Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M.

The feature that distinguishes UGA as a Sec codon is the presence of a stem-loop structure called a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element within the 3′-UTR (18Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem.

Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). We report that, compared with control HuH7 cells, HCV-replicon cells expressed less GI-GPx and were more susceptible toward ROS-producing agents. Ectopic expression of GI-GPx in replicon cells resulted in a decrease of the HCV RNA and protein NS5a. We show that up-regulation of GI-GPx by retinoic acid and selenite caused drastic down-regulation of HCV in the replicon system. Therefore, retinoids, which exert their action by influencing gene networks, may be useful for treating HCV patients. Cell Culture—Cultures of the human hepatoma cell line HuH7 (23Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) and the HuH7 cell clones 5-15, 9-13, and 11-7, which contain the HCV replicons I389/NS3–3′, I377/NS3–3′, and I377/NS2–3′ (Fig. 1A), respectively, were propagated as described (10Lohmann V. Körner F. Koch J.O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar, 11Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Rutter G. Kurpanek K.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated, fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. G418 (geneticin) (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 750 μg/ml to medium used for culturing cell lines carrying HCV replicons. Cells were routinely passaged every 2–3 days at a dilution of 1:2 to 1:4, depending on density and cell line. Human interferon α was purchased from Sigma. HEK 293 cells were transfected by the Ca2+-phosphate DNA co-precipitation method. Screening of Arrays—Atlas™ (Clontech) “apoptosis” and “stress” cDNA expression arrays include 205 and 234 human cDNAs, respectively, spotted in duplicate dots (10 ng of cDNA per dot) on positively charged nylon membranes. Probes were generated in a volume of 15 μl by reverse-transcribing 5 μg of total RNA in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-33P]dATP, dNTPs, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and a cDNA synthesis primer mix, which is a combination of primers specific for each type of Atlas™ array. After removal of the non-incorporated nucleotides on a Sepharose spin column, efficiency of labeling was controlled by scintillation counting. Filters were prehybridized for 1 h and then hybridized with the radioactive probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml) for 15 h at 68 °C. After washing two times with 2× SSC, 1% SDS and four times with 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 68 °C, membranes were exposed to x-ray films or to a PhosphorImaging screen (0.5–2 days). Data were utilized when the nine housekeeping genes of the filters generated similar signals for all four HuH7 cell lines. Only those signals, which were at least three times above background of filters, were considered as specific. Northern Blot Analysis—Cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen, Germany). 5 μg of total RNA per lane was separated in 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels and transferred onto Hybond™-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blot with 10× SSC. Pre-hybridization was performed in 6× SSC containing 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 4 h. For detection of mRNAs, specific antisense oligonucleotides (10 ng) were radioactively labeled with terminal transferase and 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). The sequences of probes used are as follows: PKR probe (coding region, 1293–1332; GenBank™ accession number XM_002661.1), 5′-CGT TAT TAT ATT TAA CAC GTT TAA TAA CGT AAG TCT TTC C-3′; neo-probe (coding region of Tn-5), 5′-CCA GAT CAT CCT GAT CGA CAA GAC CGG CTT CC-3′; GI-GPx probe 1 (coding region, bp 526–560; GenBank™ accession number XM_007364.1), 5′-TGG TTG GGA AGG TGC GGC TGT AGC GTC GGA AGG GC-3′; GI-GPx probe 2 (3′-UTR, bp 841–880; GenBank™ accession number XM_007364.1), 5′-CCT CTC AGA CAC CAC CCA TGA GGG TTT AGG AAG GTG CCA T-3′; cGPx-probe 1 (bp 304–343; GenBank™ accession number Y00433), 5′-GCC GCT AGC CGA GCA GCA CAC ATG GCG CAA TTG TCC AAG A-3′; and cGPx-probe 2 (bp 988–1027; GenBank™ accession number Y00433), 5′-GTT CCT CCC TCG TAG GTT TAG AGG AAA CAC CCT CAT AGA T-3′. The 32P-labeled probes were added to freshly prepared pre-hybridization solution at 106 cpm/ml and incubated with the membranes overnight at 65 °C. Filters were washed three times with 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min each, followed by three washes with 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at 60 °C for 15 min each. The blots were exposed overnight at –80 °C to Kodak X-Omat AR films with intensifier screens. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (24Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HuH7 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, collected by centrifugation (10 min at 2000 × g), and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysed cells were centrifuged for 10 min with 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by using the BCA reagents (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semi-dry blotting. The membranes were blocked with PBS/Triton (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.2), supplemented with 5% low fat milk powder (w/v) for 1 h. The primary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 1% low fat milk powder (w/v) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C. We used an NS5 antibody (Biogenesis, Cambridge, UK) (1:1000), a GI-GPx-specific polyclonal antibody, kindly obtained from R. Brigelius-Flohé (University of Potsdam, Germany) (1:500), MnSOD and PKR antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (1:100), an α-tubulin and a hemagglutinin tag-specific antibody, both diluted 1:2000 (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000 in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 with 1% low fat milk powder; w/v) (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature to detect bound antibodies. Membranes were washed with PBS/Triton, and secondary antibodies were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using medical x-ray films (Fuji). Glutathione Peroxidase Assay—For measuring cellular glutathione peroxidase activity, we followed the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested with a rubber policeman in 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. After spinning for 15 min at 10,000 × g (4 °C), protein concentration of the supernatant was determined with the BCA reagents. 180 μg of protein were applied per assay. tert-Butyl hydroperoxide was used as substrate, and GPx activity was estimated indirectly. Oxidized glutathione, produced upon reduction of the peroxide by GPx, is recycled to its reduced state by glutathione reductase by oxidation of NADPH + H+ to NADP+. The oxidation of NADPH+ is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, which provides a spectrophotometric means of monitoring GPx activity. The rate of decrease in the A340 is directly proportional to the GPx activity in the sample. This assay does not discriminate between the activities of individual isozymes of the glutathione peroxidase gene family. Cell Viability Assay—For quantification of the degree of cell death in cell culture, we employed the viability assay based on the reduction of tetrazolium salt to formazan by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. The assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) as described previously (24Herget T. Specht H. Esdar C. Oehrlein S.A. Maelicke A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but Alamar Blue (Roche Applied Science) was used instead of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Eight wells per sample point were analyzed, and each experiment was repeated independently at least three times. Transfection of HuH7 Cells—A 2.0-kb promoter fragment of the gpx2 gene was amplified by PCR utilizing genomic DNA isolated from 9-13 replicon cells and HEK 293 cells. The upstream primer (5′-GGG GAT TAA TTC CTA CAA ACA ATT CTC ATT TGC-3′) contained an AsnI restriction site, and the downstream primer (5′-GGG GCT CGA GGC CTG AGC CCA CTT ATG-3′) contained an XhoI restriction site. This fragment was fused with the luciferase gene, which was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) via the restriction sites PstI and XbaI, resulting in the pGPx-Luc vector. Sequence analysis revealed that the gpx2 promoter amplified from 9-13 replicon and HE293 cells were identical with published sequences (25Kelner M.J. Bagnell R.D. Montoya M.A. Lanham K.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pGPx-Luc plasmid was transfected into HuH7 cells and co-transfected with the vector pBabeΩ6 (26Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) in 9-13 replicon cells, and stable transfectants were selected for 3 weeks with 1 mg/ml geneticin (G-418, Calbiochem) and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Pools of drug-resistant cells were used for experiments. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—We tested siRNAs targeting two positions of the human GPx2 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number X68314). The sense sequence of duplex 1 siRNA was r(CCC UCU GGU UGG UGA UUC A)dTdT and of duplex 2 was r(GGA UGA UGG CAC CUU CCU A)dTdT. The control, nonsilencing siRNA was r(UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG U)dTdT. The GPx2 and control siRNAs were designed by Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD). One control siRNA, r(GAC ACU GAG ACA CCA AUU GAC)dTdT targeting the NS5b coding sequence, was shown to suppress HCV effectively (27Takigawa Y. Nagano-Fujii M. Deng L. Hidajat R. Tanaka M. Mizuta H. Hotta H. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 48: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although the 5′-UTR siRNA r(UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG U) dTdT had little effect on HCV (28Wilson J.A. Jayasena S. Khvorova A. Sabatinos S. Rodrigue-Gervais I.G. Arya S. Sarangi F. Harris-Brandts M. Beaulieu S. Richardson C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2783-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). All siRNAs were synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon. For annealing, a 20 μm siRNA solution was prepared, heated up to 90 °C for 1 min, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The day before transfections, 5 × 105 HuH7 5-15 cells were plated per well of a 6-well plate. Transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium. The final siRNA concentration was 50 nm. After 3 days, transfections were repeated, and cells were incubated for another 3 days in the presence or absence of 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid and 50 nm sodium selenite. Cultures were rinsed, harvested, and lysed, and 20 μg of protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Adenovirus Construction, Purification, and Infection—The adenovirus used here were all E1- and E3-defective derivatives of adenovirus type 5 (reviewed in Ref. 29Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2573-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The coding region for GI-GPx (0.7 kb) was amplified by PCR by using an upstream primer containing a HindIII recognition site (5′-GCG CAA GCT TAT GGC TTT CAT TGC CAA GTC CTT C-3′, start codon underlined) and a downstream primer containing an XbaI site (5′-GTT CAT CTA GAT ATG GCA ACT TTA AGG AGG CGC TTG-3′). The 3′-UTR (0.3 kb) of the GI-GPx mRNA, containing a SECIS element, was amplified using the upstream primer 5′-GCC CTC GAG ATG TGA ACT GCT CAA CAC ACA G-3′ with an XhoI recognition site and the downstream primer 5′-CCA CGC GGC CGC TTT ATT GGT CTC TTC TAG CAG AGT GGC-3′ covering the polyadenylation site (AAUAAA) and containing a NotI recognition site for cloning. RNA isolated from HuH7 cells was reverse-transcribed by random priming and used as template for PCR. The cDNA coding for human GI-GPx was cloned with and without 3′-UTR into the transfer plasmid (pPM7) between the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer and the rabbit β-globin intron/polyadenylation signal. This expression cassette was inserted into a bacterial plasmid-borne adenovirus genome using recombination in bacteria (30Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cotten M. Stegmueller K. Eickhoff J. Hanke M. Herzberger K. Herget T. Choidas A. Daub H. Godl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A cloned version of the novel genome was identified by DNA analysis, and the viral genome was released from the plasmid by restriction enzyme digestion, and virus replication was initiated by transfecting the genome into HEK 293 cells. Virus was amplified in modified HEK 293 cells and purified from cell lysates using CsCl density gradient centrifugation as described (31Cotten M. Stegmueller K. Eickhoff J. Hanke M. Herzberger K. Herget T. Choidas A. Daub H. Godl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Virus was quantified by protein content using the conversion factor 1 mg/ml pure virion protein = 3.4 × 1012 viral particles/ml (31Cotten M. Stegmueller K. Eickhoff J. Hanke M. Herzberger K. Herget T. Choidas A. Daub H. Godl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The control viruses AdJ5 and AdLuc were described previously (32Glotzer J.B. Michou A.I. Baker A. Saltik M. Cotton M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2421-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GI-GPx Is Down-regulated in Replicon Cells—Interference of HCV with cellular signaling events can be reflected in altered gene expression. Possible influences and dependences of HCV RNA replication and HCV proteins on host cell transcription are accessible to analysis with cDNA arrays. Three replicon cell lines (HuH 9-13, HuH 5-15, and HuH 11-7) (10Lohmann V. Körner F. Koch J.O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar, 11Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Rutter G. Kurpanek K. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1252-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) were analyzed for alterations in cellular RNA expression patterns. HuH7-pcDNA3 cells are HuH7 cells resistant to G-418 by integration of a neo gene-carrying plasmid (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) and served as control. Radioactively labeled complex cDNA probes were derived from the RNA of these four cell lines and were hybridized with the cDNA array membranes (stress and apoptosis arrays, Atlas™, Clontech). Results from this novel signal tranduction microarray analysis revealed significant down-regulation (10–20-fold) of GI-GPx message in the three replicon cell lines (data not shown). To verify the results obtained by cDNA array screening, we performed Northern blot analyses utilizing 10 μg of total RNA of each cell line and two different radioactively labeled DNA oligonucleotides as probes. The sequences were deduced from the coding region (GI-GPx; probe 1) and from the 3′-UTR (GI-GPx; probe 2) (Fig. 1B). Densitometric scanning of autoradiograms of three independent experiments established that the mRNA coding for GI-GPx is about 10- (HuH 5-15) and 20-fold (HuH 11-7 and HuH 9-13) down-regulated in replicon cell lines compared with control cell line HuH7 pcDNA3 (Fig. 1B). We performed Northern blot analyses with RNA isolated from four naive HuH7 cell lines with various numbers of passages (passage 15, 41, 80, and 136) to rule out that due to clonal selection the HuH7 pcDNA3 reference cell line overexpressed the GI-GPx mRNA. These cell cultures expressed similar levels of GI-GPx mRNA as the HuH7 pcDNA3 reference cell line (data not shown). Thus, the low amount of GI-GPx mRNA in the replicon cell lines was linked to the presence of HCV-RNA and/or HCV-proteins. Furthermore, we wondered whether the cytoplasmic member of the glutathione peroxidase family expressed in hepatocytes, the cellular glutathione peroxidase (cGPx), compensates for the deficiency of the GI-GPx message. Stripping the membranes (Fig. 1B) and hybridizing them with radioactively labeled DNA oligonucleotides specific for human cGPx revealed similar cGPx mRNA levels in control cells and replicon cells (Fig. 1B, lower panels). These data demonstrate that the GI-GPx gene is specifically affected by the HCV replicon. The level of GI-GPx mRNA (Fig. 1B) was also reflected on the protein level. GI-GPx protein was readily detectable in pcDNA3 cells, was hardly detectable in 5-15, and undetectable in 9-13 and 11-7 replicons (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Furthermore, we studied the expression of MnSOD, another enzyme involved in detoxification of cellular radicals. Western blotting demonstrated that levels of MnSOD protein were similar in the three replicon cell lines and in pcDNA3 control cells (Fig. 1C, middle panel). Replicon Cells Are Susceptible to Oxidative Stress—We addressed physiological consequences of the transcriptional down-regulation of the GI-GPx gene. Therefore, cellular extracts of pcDNA3 control cells and the three replicon cell lines (HuH 5-15, 11-7, and 9-13) were prepared to estimate activity of the cellular glutathione peroxidase. The data show that indeed the three replicon cell lines exhibited only about half of the GPx activity of the pcDNA3 control cells (Fig. 2A). These findings prompted us to investigate whether the replicon cells were more susceptible toward treatment with radical and oxidative stress-producing compounds. Replicon cell lines and control cells (HuH7 pcDNA3) were incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of paraquat (methyl viologen), and the viability of the cultures was measured using the Alamar Blue assay. Paraquat, a bipyridol herbicide that uses molecular oxygen to produce superoxide anion radical and subsequently hydrogen peroxide (33Farrington J.A. Ebert M. Land E.J. Fletcher K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), impaired viability of replicon cells more severely than of HuH7 pcDNA3 control cells (Fig. 2B). The estimated LD50 values for paraquat calculated from three independent experiments were 260 ± 50 μm for HuH 9-13, 270 ± 75 μm for HuH 5-15, 310 ± 65 μm for HuH 11-7, and 3 mm±120 μm for HuH pcDNA3. Thus, the HCV replicon cells were about 10-fold more susceptible toward this radical-producing compound. Simi"
https://openalex.org/W2028624339,"Myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) is a cellular substrate for protein kinase C (PKC). Recently, we have shown that PKC isoforms-α and -δ, as well as the Rho/Rho kinase (ROK) pathway, play a role in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-mediated secretion of the gut peptide neurotensin (NT) in the BON human endocrine cell line. Here, we demonstrate that activation of MARCKS protein is important for PMA- and bombesin (BBS)-mediated NT secretion in BON cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) to MARCKS significantly inhibited, whereas overexpression of wild-type MARCKS significantly increased PMA-mediated NT secretion. Endogenous MARCKS and green fluorescent protein-tagged wild-type MARCKS were translocated from membrane to cytosol upon PMA treatment, further confirming MARCKS activation. MARCKS phosphorylation was inhibited by PKC-δ siRNA, ROKα siRNA, and C3 toxin (a Rho protein inhibitor), suggesting that the PKC-δ and the Rho/ROK pathways are necessary for MARCKS activation. The phosphorylation of PKC-δ was inhibited by C3 toxin, demonstrating that the role of MARCKS in NT secretion was regulated by PKC-δ downstream of the Rho/ROK pathway. BON cell clones stably transfected with the receptor for gastrin releasing peptide, a physiologic stimulant of NT, and treated with BBS, the amphibian equivalent of gastrin releasing peptide, demonstrated a similar MARCKS phosphorylation as noted with PMA. BBS-mediated NT secretion was attenuated by MARCKS siRNA. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for novel signaling pathways, including the sequential regulation of MARCKS activity by Rho/ROK and PKC-δ proteins, in stimulated gut peptide secretion.

Furthermore, we found that protein kinase D (PKD), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is structurally distinct from the PKC family members, and the Rho/Rho kinase (ROK) pathway is involved in PMA-mediated NT secretion as well as NT secretion mediated by bombesin (BBS), the amphibian equivalent of gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), which is a physiologic stimulant of NT release in vivo (11Li J.

Furthermore, in isolated pancreatic islets, phosphorylation of MARCKS is increased by administration of either glucose or carbachol (33Calle R. Ganesan S. Smallwood J.I. Rasmussen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18723-18727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of MARCKS in gut peptide secretion is not known. Given the fact that the MARCKS proteins represent substrates for PKC, we speculated that PKC-mediated regulation of NT secretion might involve MARCKS activation. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine: (i) the role of MARCKS in PMA- and BBS-mediated NT secretion in BON cells, and (ii) whether the PKC and PKD and/or the Rho/ROK pathway are involved in the regulation of MARCKS activity. Here, we show that MARCKS small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly inhibited NT secretion, whereas overexpression of wild-type MARCKS resulted in a significant increase in PMA-mediated NT secretion in intact BON cells. The phosphorylation of MARCKS was inhibited by PKC-δ siRNA, ROKα siRNA, and C3 toxin (a Rho protein inhibitor). The phosphorylation of PKC-δ was inhibited by C3 toxin. MARCKS siRNA also inhibited BBS-stimulated NT secretion from the BON/GRPR cell lines. MARCKS phosphorylation, stimulated by BBS, was attenuated by PKC-δ and ROKα siRNA, demonstrating the dependence of MARCKS activity on PKC-δ and ROKα. Importantly, our results identify a role for MARCKS activation in the stimulated release of the intestinal peptide NT through sequential regulation by PKC-δ and Rho/ROK proteins.

Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32264-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MARCKS, ROKα, PKC-α, -δ, and PKD siRNA were synthesized by Custom SMARTPool siRNA Design Service of Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The nonspecific control siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. Recombinant GST-C3 and GST control proteins were purified from Escherichia coli using constructs provided by Dr. Keith Burridge (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stable Cell Lines—The BON cell line was derived from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor and characterized in our laboratory (9Evers B.M. Ishizuka J. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson J.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 733: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). BON cells are maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mixture, F12K, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Stable clones of BON cells transfected with the receptor for GRP (GRPR) tagged with GFP were established as described previously (11Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28466-28474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and cultured in the same medium as BON cells except supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 (400 μg/ml). All plasmids, siRNA, and GST-C3 protein were transfected by electroporation (400 V, 500 microfarads for plasmids or siRNA; 450 V, 25 microfarads for GST-C3 protein) using GenePulser XCell (Bio-Rad). Cell Treatments and NT Radioimmunoassay (RIA)—All experiments were performed 24-48 h after seeding cells or transfection if not specifically indicated. Before each experiment, BON cells were washed with serum-free secretion medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12K containing 1% dialyzed BSA) and starved in secretion medium. For NT release experiments, BON cells were treated with PMA in secretion medium for 30 min. For inhibitor treatments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min, followed by combined treatments with PMA (10 nm) and inhibitors for another 30 min. BON/GRPR cells were treated with BBS (100 nm) in Krebs-Henseleit buffer, containing 0.294 g/liter of CaCl2, 5.9 g/liter of HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) for 30 min. Medium was collected and stored at -80 °C until RIA for NT. RIA for NT was performed in duplicate samples as described previously (35Jones P.M. Howell S.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation and Western Blotting—Protein preparation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (10Li J. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1197-G1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, equal amounts of protein were resolved on NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were developed using the ECL detection system. Immunofluorescent Staining and Fluorescent Microscopy—BON cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Three days after seeding, cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or PMA (10 nm) for 30 min. After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 37 °C and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 20 min. The cells were incubated with goat polyclonal anti-MARCKS antibody diluted 1:100 with 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA/PBS. The fluorescence of MARCKS immunoreactivity was observed under a fluorescent microscope. Real Time Confocal Microscopy—BON cells, transiently expressing GFP-tagged MARCKS, were cultured in 25-mm round coverslips in 6-well plates and imaged in real time before and after PMA treatment. Cells were placed inside a pre-warmed (37 °C) chamber on the stage of an LSM 510 META confocal system configured with an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). GFP fluorescence images were acquired using a plan-apochromat ×63, 1.4 NA oil immersion objectives and the 488-nm line of an argon-ion laser for excitation. The image acquisition and processing was carried out using the Zeiss LSM510 work station (version 3.0) and the Zeiss Image Browser (version 3.1) software. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times and data were reported as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test because of heterogeneous variability in each group. All tests were assessed at the 0.05 level of significance. All statistical computations were conducted using the SAS™ system, Release 8.2 (36SAS Institute Inc. SAS/STAT ® User's Guide. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC1999Google Scholar). MARCKS siRNA Inhibits PMA-mediated NT Secretion and MARCKS Expression in BON Cells—Based on findings that PKC-α and -δ regulated PMA-mediated NT secretion in BON cells (10Li J. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1197-G1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we determined whether MARCKS, a major PKC substrate that has been implicated in the secretion and membrane trafficking of a number of cell types (17Singer M. Martin L.D. Vargaftig B.B. Park J. Gruber A.D. Li Y. Adler K.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Salli U. Saito N. Stormshak F. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Sasaki Y. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 93: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was also involved in PMA-mediated NT secretion. We utilized the RNA interference technique to selectively reduce MARCKS expression (Fig. 1). BON cells were transfected with MARCKS siRNA and the control siRNA. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were treated with PMA (10 nm) or the vehicle control (Me2SO) for 30 min. The medium was collected and NT secretion was assayed by RIA (Fig. 1A). Transfection with siRNA directed against MARCKS decreased PMA-stimulated NT secretion by more than 50% from BON cells compared with the control siRNA. Cells were lysed and Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression of endogenous MARCKS (Fig. 1B, top). Compared with cells transfected with the control siRNA, MARCKS siRNA markedly suppressed endogenous MARCKS protein expression. The blot was reprobed with β-actin demonstrating equal loading (Fig. 1B, bottom). Overexpression of Wild-type MARCKS Increases PMA-mediated NT Secretion—To further confirm the role of MARCKS in NT secretion, BON cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type MARCKS, phosphorylation mutant (MARCKS-A/S) and myristoylation mutant (MARCKS-A2/G2), or the empty vector (pEGFP-N-1) as a control (Fig. 2). Cells were serum starved for 30 min and then treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or PMA (10 nm) for 30 min and the medium was collected for measurement of NT by RIA (Fig. 2A). In the absence of PMA treatment, overexpression of the three MARCKS constructs did not affect NT release compared with the empty vector. Importantly, PMA treatment of cells transfected with wild-type MARCKS significantly enhanced NT secretion compared with PMA treatment of BON cells transfected with the empty vector. In contrast, overexpression of the phosphorylation and myristoylation mutants and treatment with PMA did not enhance NT secretion compared with cells transfected with the control vector in the presence of PMA. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysate was performed to determine the phosphorylation of exogenous (exo) and endogenous (endo) MARCKS (Fig. 2B). The membrane was blotted with GFP to monitor the overexpression of MARCKS in BON cells; GFP-tagged MARCKS was detected after transfection with the three MARCKS constructs either in the presence or absence of PMA, but not with the control vector (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated serine 152/156 of MARCKS (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Phosphorylation of exogenous MARCKS was induced in BON cells transfected with either the wild-type MARCKS and myristoylation mutant MARCKS, but not in BON cells transfected with the phosphorylation mutant MARCKS. As expected, exogenous MARCKS was not detected in BON cells transfected with the control vector. Similar levels of endogenous (endo) phosphorylated MARCKS (∼65 kDa) were detected in BON cells transfected with all three MARCKS constructs, in the presence of PMA. Taken together, these data demonstrate activation of either overexpressed MARCKS or endogenous MARCKS and the enhancement of NT secretion by MARCKS overexpression. PMA Induces Translocation of Endogenous MARCKS from Membrane to the Cytosol in BON Cells—To further support the role of MARCKS in PMA-mediated NT secretion, we next analyzed the activation of endogenous MARCKS by PMA in BON cells by observing translocation using immunofluorescent imaging (Fig. 3). BON cells were cultured on coverslips and stained with anti-MARCKS antibody followed by Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody and translocation was observed by fluorescent microscopy. Endogenous MARCKS was expressed on the membrane of vehicle (Me2SO)-treated BON cells (Fig. 3, left) and translocated to the cytosol of PMA-treated BON cells (Fig. 3, right). These results demonstrate the activation of endogenous MARCKS protein in BON cells by PMA. PMA Induces Translocation of Wild-type MARCKS but Not Phosphorylation Mutant or Myristoylation Mutant MARCKS in BON Cells—To examine the intracellular translocation characteristics of exogenous MARCKS, GFP-tagged wild-type and mutant MARCKS were transfected separately into BON cells. GFP fluorescence was visualized in BON cells using time-lapse confocal microscopy to monitor translocation of MARCKS (Fig. 4). Serial images were taken before and after the addition of PMA (100 nm). As a control, the fluorescence in BON cells transfected with empty vector was first observed before and after the addition of PMA (Fig. 4, upper panel); no changes in GFP localization were noted after PMA treatment. Intense fluorescence was observed in BON cells transfected with wild-type MARCKS (Fig. 4, second panel). The addition of PMA induced a rapid translocation of wild-type MARCKS from the plasma membrane to the cytosol within 1 min after stimulation. These findings are consistent with our results showing translocation of endogenous MARCKS to the cytosol from the membrane after PMA stimulation in fixed cells (Fig. 3). In untreated BON cells transfected with phosphorylation mutant MARCKS (A/S), GFP fluorescence was present in the membrane, similar to wild-type MARCKS (Fig. 4, third panel). The addition of PMA did not result in translocation of the phosphorylation mutant MARCKS. In contrast, in untreated BON cells transfected with the myristoylation mutant MARCKS (A2/G2), GFP fluorescence was present in the cytosol (Fig. 4, lower panel). Treatment with PMA did not alter the location of the myristoylation mutant MARCKS. These results demonstrate that both the phosphorylation domain and the myristoylation domain are important for the function of MARCKS and the activation of wild-type MARCKS further supports the role of MARCKS in NT secretion. Activation of MARCKS Is Dependent on PKC-δ, but Not PKC-α or PKD—MARCKS is known to be a PKC substrate in some cell types (13Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our previous studies in which we found that PKC-α and -δ play important roles in PMA-mediated NT secretion, we next determined whether PKC isoforms are involved in PMA-induced MARCKS activation in BON cells using the PKC inhibitors, Gö6976, Gö6983, GF109203X, and Ro31-8220, which inhibit activity of conventional and novel PKC isoforms (38Way K.J.

Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), and Rottlerin, which is a selective PKC-δ inhibitor (38Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). BON cells were pretreated with these inhibitors (1 μm for each) for 30 min prior to a 10-min exposure to PMA (10 nm). As shown in Fig. 5A, all of the inhibitors blocked MARCKS phosphorylation at Ser-152/156 (upper panel), suggesting the requirement of upstream PKC isoforms in the activation of MARCKS. The membrane was reprobed with β-actin as a loading control (lower panel). We next used siRNA against PKC-α, PKC-δ, or PKD to further delineate the proteins that contribute to MARCKS activation (Fig. 5B). BON cells were transfected with PKC-α, PKC-δ, or PKD siRNA or the control siRNA. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were treated with PMA (10 nm) or the vehicle control (Me2SO) for 30 min. Compared with cells transfected with the control siRNA, transfection of PKC-α, PKC-δ, and PKD siRNA significantly inhibited PKC-α (data not shown), PKC-δ (Fig. 5B, top panel), and PKD (data not shown) expression, respectively. Importantly, MARCKS phosphorylation was not decreased by either PKC-α or PKD siRNA (data not shown) but markedly decreased by PKC-δ siRNA (Fig. 5B, middle panel). Membranes were reprobed with β-actin demonstrating equal loading (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). Taken together, the results suggest that MARCKS protein is a downstream effector of PKC-δ in BON cells. Rho/ROK Pathway Is Involved in MARCKS Activation by PMA in BON Cells—ROK (a downstream effector of Rho proteins) regulates MARCKS activation in neuronal cells (37Sasaki Y. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 93: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that the Rho/ROK pathway contributed to PMA-mediated NT secretion in BON cells (11Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28466-28474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we determined whether the Rho/ROK pathway is involved in PMA-stimulated MARCKS phosphorylation (Fig. 6). ROK inhibitors, Y27632 and HA1077 (both at a concentration of 15 μm), were first used to assess the effect of ROK inhibition on MARCKS phosphorylation. Both inhibitors markedly attenuated MARCKS phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, top). These findings suggest the involvement of upstream ROK in the activation of MARCKS. Total MARCKS was probed to assess loading equality (Fig. 6A, bottom). To further confirm the involvement of the Rho/ROK pathway, the role of ROKα (an isoform of ROK proteins) on MARCKS phosphorylation was examined using ROKα siRNA (Fig. 6B). The inhibition of ROKα expression was shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6B, top panel). PMA-mediated MARCKS phosphorylation was decreased in BON cells transfected with ROKα siRNA compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 6B, middle panel). The blot was reprobed with β-actin as a loading control (Fig. 6B, bottom panel). These results further indicate the regulation of MARCKS activity by ROKα. Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin specifically ADP-ribosylates Rho and impairs its function (40Just I. Hofmann F. Genth H. Gerhard R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We previously showed that C3 toxin inhibited PMA-mediated NT secretion in BON cells (11Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R.

Therefore, to determine whether Rho proteins are involved in MARCKS activity, BON cells were transfected with C3 toxin overnight and treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or PMA (10 nm).

Besides the regulation of ENaC by hormones, intracellular factors such as Na+ ions, pH, or Ca2+ are responsible for fast adaptive responses of ENaC activity to changes in the intracellular milieu. In this study, we show that ENaC is rapidly and reversibly inhibited by internal sulfhydryl-reactive molecules such as methanethiosulfonate derivatives of different sizes, the metal cations Cd2+ and Zn2+, or copper(II) phenanthroline, a mild oxidizing agent that promotes the formation of disulfide bonds.

The regulation of sodium absorption in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron is essential for the maintenance of sodium balance by adapting the renal Na+ excretion to daily salt intake; imbalance in Na+ intake and excretion has important consequences on extracellular fluid volume and consequently on blood pressure (1Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). In the lungs, ENaC at the apical surface of the airways epithelium is also involved in the process of Na+ absorption to maintain the level and the composition of the air-surface liquid (2Boucher R.C. Eur. Respir. J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Hormonal and nonhormonal factors control ENaC activity in epithelia. In the distal nephron, the cell surface expression of ENaC is regulated by aldosterone and vasopressin. This hormonal control of ENaC activity at the cell surface involves intracellular cascades of events that are not yet fully understood (3Verrey F. Hummler E. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Seldin D.W.

Nonhormonal stimuli such as intracellular pH, Ca2+ or Na+ ions achieve a rapid regulation of ENaC activity, to control the influx of Na+ ions into the cells (4Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). ENaC belongs to a heterogeneous family of ion channels which contains channels regulated by hormones such as ENaC or acid-sensing ion channels that are gated by external protons (5Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). These channels are heteromeric channels composed of subunits with two putative transmembrane segments (TM1 and TM2) separated by a large extracellular loop. They share with other genetically unrelated channels, such as K+ channels, a similar membrane topology with the amino and carboxyl termini of the subunits facing the intracellular side of the membrane. These α, β, and γ subunits of ENaC are arranged pseudosymmetrically around the channel pore so that all subunits participate in specific ENaC functions such as channel block by amiloride, ionic permeability, and selectivity (6Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 7Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To achieve high ionic selectivity like K+ channels, ENaC is likely composed by a limited number of subunits; several evidences support a four-subunit stoichiometry composed of 2α, 1β, and 1γ ENaC subunits (6Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The binding site for amiloride has been located in a short segment of the extracellular loop preceding the second transmembrane segment (TM2), which likely forms the outer entrance of the channel. An external modulatory site for ENaC activity is located upstream from the amiloride binding site in the ENaC sequence (9Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 413-424Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At the extracellular 5′ start of the TM2 segment a short stretch of 3 amino acids is important to prevent larger cations such as K+ or ammonium ions from passing through the channel and likely forms the external narrow ionic selectivity filter in ENaC (8Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The extracellular loop of ENaC contains domains rich in cysteine residues that are highly conserved among the members of the ENaC degenerin family. These extracellular cysteine residues of ENaC are likely to be involved in the formation of disulfide bonds important for the proper folding of the protein (12Firsov D. Robert-Nicoud M. Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2743-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues are also found in the transmembrane segments and in the amino and carboxyl termini of α, β, and γ ENaC subunits and are potentially accessible from the intracellular milieu (Fig. 1). The amino termini of αβγ ENaC subunit sequences contain together 8 cysteine residues, and 5 of them are conserved among species (from amphibian to human). They flank a highly conserved HG motif that plays an important role in ENaC gating (13Grunder S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The role of these intracellular cysteine residues in ENaC is unknown, and so far, no study has been conducted to determine the effects of chemical modifications or substitutions of these intracellular cysteine residues on ENaC function. We found that ENaC is highly sensitive to intracellular thiol reagents and thiol oxidation, suggesting a possible adaptation of ENaC activity to changes in the intracellular redox potential. Multiple cysteine residues located in the vicinity of an intracellular gating domain in the amino-terminal region of ENaC subunits as well as in the carboxyl termini of α and β ENaC subunits are involved in ENaC inhibition mediated by intracellular thiol reagents. ENaC Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Complementary RNAs of each αβγ wild type or mutant subunit were synthesized in vitro. Oocytes were surgically removed from the ovarian tissue of female Xenopus laevis which had been anesthetized by immersion in MS-222 (2 g liter-1; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland). The oocytes were defolliculated, and healthy stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were isolated and pressure-injected at the border between the vegetal and animal poles with 100 nl of a solution containing equal amounts of α, β, and γ ENaC subunits, at a total concentration of 100 ng/μl. Electrophysiological Analysis—Electrophysiological measurements were taken at 24–36 h after injection. Macroscopic currents were recorded using the cut-open oocyte technique originally developed by Tagliatella et al. and adapted for ENaC current measurements (14Abriel H. Horisberger J.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 31-43Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The cut-open technique allows the recording of macroscopic currents while both the inside and the outside of the oocyte are perfused continuously. Xenopus oocytes are placed in an experimental chamber divided in three bath compartments, the upper bath compartment, the guard bath compartment, and the lower bath compartment. The superior pole of the oocyte is in contact with the upper bath compartment through a hole of 500-μm diameter in a device separating the upper compartment from the guard bath compartment. The upper compartment is perfused continuously with the extracellular solution. The lower pole of the oocyte is impaled from the used bottom of the chamber by a microperfusion pipette used as a microelectrode. The microperfusion pipette is advanced from the lower bath compartment into the oocyte until it is visible from the upper bath compartment across the plasma membrane. The guard bath compartment separates the upper and the lower bath compartments and provides an electrical isolation between the extracellular (upper) and intracellular (lower) compartments, by clamping the electrical voltage of the guard compartment to the same voltage as the external (upper) compartment. The voltage clamp was performed using a Dagan cut-open oocyte voltage clamp apparatus (Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN; model CA-1 high performance oocyte clamp). The extracellular (upper) compartment was perfused at a rate of ∼8 ml/min with an extracellular solution containing 80 mm sodium gluconate, 10 mm tetraethylammonium-Cl, 5 mm BaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10mm Hepes-N-methyl-d-glucamine, pH 7.5, with or without 10 μm amiloride. ENaC current (INa) was defined as the difference between the current flowing through the portion of the oocyte membrane exposed to the upper compartment, in the absence and presence of 10 μm amiloride. During the experiment, the intracellular compartment was kept at a holding potential of –100 mV. The intracellular electrode was a glass pipette made of a single barreled glass capillary (Kwik-Fil Borosilicate TW100 –4, World Precision Instruments) in which two thin capillaries (Microfil, World Precision Instruments) had been inserted far enough that their tips were close to the pipette tip. This allowed rapid changes of intracellular solutions with or without thiol reagents (perfusion rate 2 μl/min). The intracellular solution contained 90 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm sodium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2, 200 μm BAPTA, 10 mm Hepes-N-methyl-d-glucamine, pH 7.35. The effects of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, Cd2+, or oxidizing conditions on single channel currents were performed in the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique, as described previously (16Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The bath solution in patch clamp experiments was similar as the intracellular solution in cut-open oocyte measurements and contained 90 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm sodium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm BAPTA, 200 μm TCEP, 10 mm Hepes-N-methyl-d-glucamine, pH 7.35. Changing of extracellular solutions in patch clamp experiments was done using the Rapid Solution Changer RSC-200 (Biologic, Claix, France). The pipette solution had the same composition as the extracellular solution in cut-open experiments with either Na+ or Li+ ions as charge carriers through ENaC. In patch clamp experiments, currents were recorded with a List EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier, using a PC-based data acquisition system (Pulse, HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) and filtered at 100–1,000 Hz for single channel analysis. Single channel openings were detected by standard half-amplitude threshold analysis, using TAC 4.09 (Bruxton Corporation, Seattle, WA). The channel number was estimated from the maximum number of overlapping openings. NPo was calculated from the TACFIT event table. Averaged data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Macroscopic whole cell currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique at a holding potential of –100 mV. Currents were recorded with a Dagan TEV-200 amplifier (Minneapolis, MN) equipped with two bath electrodes. The standard bath solution contained 110 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.35. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression in X. laevis Oocytes—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on rat αβγ ENaC cDNAs as described previously (7Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mutant cDNAs were controlled by sequencing (Synergene, Zurich, Switzerland). The cysteine residues in the amino terminus of ENaC subunits were replaced by alanine in case introduction of serine might potentially introduce phosphorylation sites in the ENaC sequence; cysteine residues in the transmembrane segments were replaced by serine residues. The different mutant constructs of αβγ rat ENaC subunits are listed in Table I. Each mutant construct was expressed either with the two homolog wild type or in combination with other mutant ENaC subunits.Table IDifferent ENaC subunit constructs generated to substitute cysteine residues with Ala or Ser in the amino terminus, the two transmembrane segments TM1 and TM2, and in the carboxyl terminusMutationsαEnaCβENaCγENaCSingleC88AC30AC33AC101AC43AC41AC118SC534SC71SC557SC546SDoubleC88A/C101AC30A/C43AC33A/C41AC30A/C534SC33A/C546SC61S/C64SC542S/C546STripleC37S/C88A/C101AC10G/C30A/C43AC33A/C41A/C71SC88A/C101A/C118SC30S/C43A/C534SC33A/C41A/C546SDeletionsC645S/P646stopC557S/R564stopW574stopQuadruple or >C37S/C88A/C101A/C118S10G/C30S/C43A/C557S/R564stopC88A/C101A/C118S/C645S/P646stop Open table in a new tab Chemicals—Copper(II) phenanthroline (Cu(Phen)3) was made from a 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline stock solution in dry ethanol and a 1.5 mm cupric sulfate stock solution in water, diluted to the final concentration of 15 μm 1,10-phenanthroline and 50 μm cupric sulfate in the bathing solution. Amiloride and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. MTS reagents were from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), and TCEP was from Calbiochem. The following MTS reagents were used: MTSEA, MTSET, MTSES, MTSEA-biotin, and MTS-PTrEA. Stock solutions of MTS reagents were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted at least 100-fold, immediately before use, into the intracellular solution. Intracellular application of 100-fold diluted dimethyl sulfoxide alone did not affect ENaC function (data not shown). Despite the presence of numerous cysteine residues in the extracellular loop ENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes is poorly sensitive to inhibition by extracellular MTS reagents; a 20 – 50% inhibition of ENaC current by external MTSEA has been reported (17Snyder P.M.

Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because MTSEA can cross membranes to a certain degree (19Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we have determined in preliminary experiments the effects of external MTSEA and MTSET on ENaC currents in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were incubated with these MTS reagents for 15 min before the current measurements. The ENaC-mediated amiloride-sensitive current measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp was not significantly different in oocytes incubated with or without 1 mm external MTSEA (12.7 ± 2.7 μA and 15.6 ± 4.7 μA, without and in the presence of 1 mm MTSEA, respectively, n = 11) or 1 mm MTSET (7.57 ± 0.99 μA and 8.52 ± 2.04 without and with MTSET, n = 8). These results indicate that ENaC is relatively insensitive to externally applied thiol-modifying reagents and exclude the possibility of extracellular effects of MTS reagents, when applied from the intracellular side of the cell membrane. ENaC Inhibition by Intracellular Thiol Reagents—To investigate the effects of MTS reagents applied from the cytosolic side on ENaC activity, we used the so-called cut-open oocyte technique, which permits intracellular perfusion of the oocyte (14Abriel H. Horisberger J.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 31-43Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Taglialatela M. Toro L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Oocytes were mounted in a specially designed chamber, and a fine glass pipette was positioned into the oocyte from the bottom of the chamber, allowing internal perfusion of the oocyte with a continuously flowing solution. The activity of ENaC was measured as the current sensitive to 10 μm amiloride applied to the external side of the oocyte membrane (see “Experimental Procedures”). Typical recordings of the ENaC current measured across the plasma membrane of an oocyte perfused from both the cytosolic and extracellular sides are shown in Fig. 2A. Removing amiloride from the extracellular solution induces a robust inward current that usually reaches hundreds of nanoamps in magnitude and remains stable for several minutes. The inward current returns to base line after readdition of amiloride in the external solution (Fig. 2A, upper left panel). To test the effects of intracellular thiol reagents on rat ENaC activity, external amiloride was first removed to induce an inward ENaC current, then 0.1 mm MTSEA or analogous reagents were applied intracellularly. Immediately after the start of MTSEA perfusion, the inward ENaC current started to decrease exponentially over a period of 2–3 min. The residual current in the presence of MTSEA returned to base line after readdition of external amiloride, indicating that the current inhibited by intracellular MTSEA represents a major fraction of the ENaC-mediated amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa). Similar inhibitory effects were observed on ENaC currents after the intracellular application of other MTS reagents (MTSET, MTS-PTrEA, or MTSEA-biotin). Fig. 2B summarizes the inhibitory effects of MTS reagents different in size: concentrations of 0.1 mm for MTSET and MTSEA and 0.5 mm for the larger MTS-PTrEA and MTSEA-biotin lead to a similar maximal inhibition after 4 min and a comparable time course of the ENaC current decrease. The on rate (kon) calculated from the exponential fit of the time course of INa inhibition was 4,198 m-1 min-1 for MTSEA, 3,786 m-1 min-1 for MTSET, 955 and 975 m-1 min-1 for MTSEA-biotin and MTS-PTrEA, respectively. This difference in kon for the large MTS reagents might be explained by a slower diffusion rate in the perfused oocyte. It should be mentioned that the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) in the perfusion solution prevented the inhibitory effects of MTSEA on INa but did not completely reverse the inhibitory effect (data not shown). These experiments indicate that cysteine residues on ENaC subunits that are accessible to large MTS molecules from the cytosolic side inhibit ENaC activity upon covalent modification. Finally we tested whether the sensitivity of ENaC to intracellular sulfhydryl-reactive molecules is a property of rat ENaC only or whether it is shared by other ENaC orthologs. Fig. 2C shows that in oocytes expressing X. laevis or human ENaC, MTSEA similarly inhibited the ENaC-mediated current, indicating that inhibition by intracellular sulfhydryl reagent is a general characteristic of the ENaC. Divalent Cations—Transition metal cations such as Cd2+ or Zn2+ can modulate the activity of a number of voltage-or ligand-gated channels by coordinating reduced thiol groups of accessible cysteine residues. We postulated that internal Cd2+ and Zn2+ have similar inhibitory effects on ENaC activity as MTS reagents if free thiol groups of cysteine residues are involved in channel block. Fig. 3A shows representative recordings of INa in oocytes internally perfused with different concentrations of Cd2+ or Zn2+, using protocols similar to those for MTS reagents in Fig. 2. It should be mentioned that stable current recordings in the cut-open oocyte require the presence of Ca2+ chelators such as BAPTA in the intracellular solution to avoid activation of Ca2+-dependent ion conductances. In the presence of 200 μm BAPTA, 500 μm intracellular Cd2+ or 500 μm Zn2+ inhibited the ENaC current, whereas lower concentrations (100 μm) where without effects, likely because of the low concentration of free Cd2+ or Zn2+. The precise IC50 for ENaC inhibition by Cd2+ or Zn2+ was thus difficult to assess precisely. In a few successful and stable recordings without intracellular BAPTA, concentrations as low as 10 μm Cd2+ were effective in inhibiting ENaC (75.6 ± 4.9% of INa inhibition after 2 min, n = 4). The time course of INa inhibition seemed slightly more rapid than for MTS reagents, and ENaC inhibition was almost complete 3 min after the beginning of the Zn2+ or Cd2+ application (Fig. 3B). As for the effect of MTSEA in the cut-open oocyte, recovery from Cd2+ inhibition was not complete after the addition of 10 mm EDTA in the internal perfusate (data not shown). These results, together with the effects of MTS reagents, strongly suggest that modification of reduced thiol groups of intracellular cysteine residues by methanethiosulfonates or transition metals rapidly inhibits ENaC activity. ENaC Block at the Single Channel Level—Macroscopic ENaC current recorded in cut-open oocytes is a function of the number of functional ENaC molecules expressed at the cell surface (N), the ENaC unitary ionic conductance (g), and the open probability (Po) of the channel. In principle, a change in any of these three components of the macroscopic ENaC current could account for the effect of thiol reagents. To differentiate between changes in single channel conductance and in channel Po, single channel activity was recorded in the inside-out patch clamp configuration. As illustrated in Fig. 4, rapid application of 50 μm MTSET to the intracellular side of an inside-out patch containing more than 10 active ENaCs resulted in a rapid and almost complete inhibition of ENaC activity with an average time constant τ of 5.3 ± 1.2 s (n = 5). This rapid time course of ENaC inhibition contrasts with the stability of ENaC activity shown in Fig. 4 and is too fast to account for a spontaneous rundown of ENaC activity sometimes observed in inside-out patches. The on rate (kon) for the ENaC blocking reaction by MTSET was 4270 ± 521 m-1 s-1 (n = 9) and faster in inside-out membrane patches compared with that measured in cut-open oocytes. This is consistent with the presence of significant diffusional constraints for MTS reagents in the internally perfused oocytes. Table II summarizes the effects of MTSET on ENaC open probability: MTSET inhibits more than 95% of ENaC current; inhibition is not complete, and rare and rapid channel reopenings can be observed in the presence of MTSET, as shown in the recording of Fig. 4A. During the application of MTSET the magnitude of single channel current remained unchanged (0.929 ± 0.103 pA before MTSET and 0.852 ± 0.174 pA after MTSET, measured at –100 mV with Li+ ions as charge carrier).Table IIENaC open probability in the presence of intracellular thiol modifiers MTSET, Cd2+, or after internal perfusion of oxidizing or reducing agents * denotes p < 0.05 versus control.NPoaNPo is the product of the number of active channels × the channel open probability and represents a measure of the activity of ENaC in the membrane patch.Control+BlockerbConditions in the presence of intracellular blockers. or after rundowncNPo measured after spontaneous rundown of ENaC activity.Recovery (+DTTdRecovery after the addition of MTSET, after Cu2+(Phe)3 (15 μm Cu2+ and 50 μm phenanthroline), and after ENaC rundown was obtained with 10 mm DTT. or EDTAeRecovery after Cd2+ was measured after addition of 10 mm EDTA.)MTSET (50 μm)28.0 ± 8.6 (6)fNumbers in parentheses represent the number of experiments.0.32 ± 0.19 (6)*bConditions in the presence of intracellular blockers.5.06 ± 1.68 (6)dRecovery after the addition of MTSET, after Cu2+(Phe)3 (15 μm Cu2+ and 50 μm phenanthroline), and after ENaC rundown was obtained with 10 mm DTT.Cd2+ (20 μm)10.7 ± 2.4 (4)0.79 ± 0.61 (4)*bConditions in the presence of intracellular blockers.4.11 ± 3.25 (4)eRecovery after Cd2+ was measured after addition of 10 mm EDTA.Cu(Phe)3 (15/50 μm)5.41 ± 1.57 (15)0.56 ± 0.16 (15)*bConditions in the presence of intracellular blockers.1.93 ± 0.71 (4)dRecovery after the addition of MTSET, after Cu2+(Phe)3 (15 μm Cu2+ and 50 μm phenanthroline), and after ENaC rundown was obtained with 10 mm DTT.ENaC rundown10.03 ± 3.47 (4)0.44 ± 0.2 (4)*cNPo measured after spontaneous rundown of ENaC activity.10.06 ± 2.79 (4)dRecovery after the addition of MTSET, after Cu2+(Phe)3 (15 μm Cu2+ and 50 μm phenanthroline), and after ENaC rundown was obtained with 10 mm DTT.a NPo is the product of the number of active channels × the channel open probability and represents a measure of the activity of ENaC in the membrane patch.b Conditions in the presence of intracellular blockers.c NPo measured after spontaneous rundown of ENaC activity.d Recovery after the addition of MTSET, after Cu2+(Phe)3 (15 μm Cu2+ and 50 μm phenanthroline), and after ENaC rundown was obtained with 10 mm DTT.e Recovery after Cd2+ was measured after addition of 10 mm EDTA.f Numbers in parentheses represent the number of experiments. Open table in a new tab The inhibitory effect of MTSET on ENaC was not spontaneously reversible. To provide further evidence that cysteine modifications by sulfhydryl-reactive molecules are responsible for ENaC inhibition, we tested whether the thiol-reducing agent DTT could reverse the effects of MTSET. The recording in Fig. 4B starts in the presence of 50 μm MTSET in the bathing solution, and ENaC activity is almost nonexistent except rare and fast openings. Removal of MTSET and the subsequent addition of 10 mm DTT resulted after ∼10 s in the appearance of typical ENaC activity and revealed the presence of at least four active ENaC channels in the patch. The data in Table II show that DTT significantly reverses the effect of MTSET; however, the reducing effect of DTT did not allow a complete recovery of ENaC activity. This can be the result of an incomplete dissociation of the MTSET from the cysteine residues in the presence of DTT; we cannot exclude a spontaneous rundown of ENaC activity over the duration of the recording which could at least in part explain this partial recovery. The inhibitory effect of Cd2+ on ENaC current was also investigated at the single channel level. The application of intracellular Cd2+ at micromolar concentrations (20 μm Cd2+, together with 10 μm BAPTA in the solution, see “Experimental Procedures”) rapidly closes the channel. As shown in Fig. 5A, ENaC inhibition by 20 μm intracellular Cd2+ is characterized by the appearance of long channel closures over a time period of several seconds, without"
https://openalex.org/W2097322897,"Zebrafish and goldfish are both diurnal freshwater fish species belonging to the same family, Cyprinidae, but their visual ecological surroundings considerably differ. Zebrafish are surface swimmers in conditions of broad and shortwave-dominated background spectra and goldfish are generalized swimmers whose light environment extends to a depth of elevated short wavelength absorbance with turbidity. The peak absorption spectrum (λmax) of the zebrafish blue (SWS2) visual pigment is consistently shifted to short wavelength (416 nm) compared with that of the goldfish SWS2 (443 nm). Among the amino acid differences between the two pigments, only one (alanine in zebrafish and serine in goldfish at residue 94) was previously known to cause a difference in absorption spectrum (14-nm λmax shift in newt SWS2). In this study, we reconstructed the ancestral SWS2 pigment of the two species by applying likelihood-based Bayesian statistics and performing site-directed mutagenesis. The reconstituted ancestral photopigment had a λmax of 430 nm, indicating that zebrafish and goldfish achieved short wavelength (-14 nm) and long wavelength (+13 nm) spectral shifts, respectively, from the ancestor. Unexpectedly, the S94A mutation resulted in only a -3-nm spectral shift when introduced into the goldfish SWS2 pigment. Nearly half of the long wavelength shift toward the goldfish pigment was achieved instead by T116L (6 nm). The S295C mutation toward zebrafish SWS2 contributed to creating a ridge of absorbance around 400 nm and broadening its spectral sensitivity in the short wavelength direction.

Vertebrate visual pigments consist of a protein moiety (i.e. opsin), and a chromophore, either 11-cis-retinal (vitamin A1 aldehyde) or 11-cis 3,4-dehydroretinal (vitamin A2 aldehyde). These pigments reside in rod and cone photoreceptor cells in the retina. Rods are used for dim light vision, and cones are used for daylight and color vision. Vertebrate visual opsins can be classified into five phylogenetic groups: RH1 1The abbreviations used are: RH1, rod opsin; RH2, RH1-like cone opsin; SWS1, short wavelength-sensitive type 1 cone opsin; SWS2, short wavelength-sensitive type 2 cone opsin; M/LWS, middle to long wavelength-sensitive cone opsin; TM, transmembrane.

Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 385-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). When an opsin forms a photopigment with the A2 chromophore, its peak absorption spectrum (λmax) is located at a longer wavelength than it forms with the A1 chromophore. The spectral shift is wavelength-dependent; it can be as great as 60 nm at longer wavelengths, and as little as 5–10 nm at shorter wavelengths (2Whitmore A.V. Bowmaker J.K. J. Comp. Physiol.

Despite having all five types of opsins in common and sharing ancestry in the same family Cyprinidae, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and goldfish (Carassius auratus) use different chromophores, A1 and A2, respectively, under normal conditions (4Nawrocki L. BreMiller R. Streisinger G. Kaplan M. Vision Res. 1985; 25: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Palacios A.G. Varela F.J. Srivastava R. Goldsmith T.H. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Saszik S. Bilotta J. Vision Res. 1999; 39: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the differences in their visual ecology: zebrafish are surface swimmers under broad and short wavelength-dominated background spectra, while goldfish are generalized swimmers whose light environment extends to a depth of elevated short wavelength absorbance with turbidity, although both are diurnal freshwater fish species (7Levine J.S. MacNichol Jr., E.F. Sens. Processes. 1979; 3: 95-131PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nicol J.A.C. The Eyes of Fishes. Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Furthermore, the λmax values of the zebrafish visual pigments are generally shifted to short wavelengths compared with those of other species (9Chinen A. Hamaoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the blue (SWS2) visual pigment is greatly shifted to short wavelength (λmax at 416 nm) compared with SWS2 pigments of other vertebrates (λmax ranging from 430 to 450 nm) under the conditions involving the A1 chromophore (9Chinen A. Hamaoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is in sharp contrast with goldfish whose A2-based SWS2 visual pigment has a λmax around 454 nm (11Parry J.W. Bowmaker J.K. Vision Res. 2000; 40: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When the goldfish SWS2 visual pigment is reconstituted in vitro with the A1 chromophore, its λmax is 443 nm (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is still 27 nm longer than the λmax of the zebrafish SWS2 pigment. By site-directed mutagenesis of the cottoid fish SWS2 opsins, T118A (threonine to alanine substitution at residue 118: site numbers hereafter follow those of bovine rod opsin), T118G and T269A were shown to cause a recognizable blue shift of their SWS2 pigments (12Cowing J.A. Poopalasundaram S. Wilkie S.E. Bowmaker J.K. Hunt D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6019-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis to the newt SWS2 opsin resulted in spectral effects in P91S, S94A, I122M, Y261F, and A292S in a short wavelength direction (13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The spectral effect of T269A, together with that of S269A, were also verified in another mutagenesis experiment in pigeon, chicken, finch, American chameleon, bull frog, salamander, and goldfish SWS2 pigments (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, I49A, V52I, T93V, and L207I were inferred to cause greater than a 5-nm spectral shift by multiple regression analysis (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, among these amino acid substitutions, only S94A is detected among amino acid differences between goldfish and zebrafish SWS2 pigments. The S94A mutation results in a 14-nm blue shift when introduced into the newt SWS2 pigment which has an exceptionally long λmax value (474 nm) among A1-based SWS2 pigments (13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Even if the S94A mutation contributes to the spectral difference between the goldfish and zebrafish SWS2 pigments with the 14-nm magnitude, additional, and previously unforeseen, mutations are required to fill the 27-nm spectral difference between the two pigments. The objective of this study is to extract amino acid substitutions that contribute to the spectral difference between the zebrafish and goldfish SWS2 pigments. For this purpose, we employed an evolutionary engineering approach, that is, inference of the ancestral amino acid sequence of the zebrafish and goldfish SWS2 opsins by likelihood-based Bayesian statistics, reconstitution of full and partial ancestral photopigments by site-directed mutagenesis, and spectral measurements of the reconstituted pigments. Sequence Analysis—The following fish SWS2 opsin genes were studied: cottoid (Batrachocottus nikolskii) (GenBank™ accession number AJ430474) (12Cowing J.A. Poopalasundaram S. Wilkie S.E. Bowmaker J.K.

Additionally, the following SWS2 opsins of non-fish vertebrates were used as outgroups: newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster) (GenBank™ accession number AB040148) (13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) (GenBank™ accession number AF038946) (18Xu L. Hazard III, E.S. Lockman D.K. Crouch R.K.

Genetics. 1999; 153: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We aligned the deduced amino acid sequences of these opsins using CLUSTAL W (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Alignment of amino acids corresponding to residues 2–8 and the last 27 of zebrafish SWS2 opsin were less reliable, requiring multiple gaps. The remaining 320 amino acids were considered for phylogenetic analysis. Using the MEGA2 program version 2.1 (27Nei M. Kumar S. Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar, 28Kumar S. Tamura K. Jacobsen I.B. Nei M. MEGA2, Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis. 2.1 Ed. Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ2001Crossref Scopus (4557) Google Scholar), the number of amino acid substitutions per site for two sequences was estimated by Poisson correction and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the neighbor-joining method (29Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) with 1000 bootstrap replications. Given the tree topology reconstructed (Fig. 1), we inferred the ancestral amino acid sequences of SWS2 opsins at every node in the tree by using the PAML computer program with a likelihood-based Bayesian method (30Yang Z. Kumar S. Nei M. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yang Z. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 555-556PubMed Google Scholar) (abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html). For computations, we used the empirical substitution matrix of Dayhoff (32Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Silver Spring, MD1978: 345-352Google Scholar) or JTT (33Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar) as a mathematical model of amino acid substitutions. These models have often been used in constructions of maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for protein sequences; the JTT model has been shown to give sufficiently accurate results for most purposes (27Nei M. Kumar S. Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). Both models are based on amino acid substitution data for conserved proteins and have been applied to inference of ancestral sequences of vertebrate opsin genes (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Yokoyama S. Radlwimmer F.B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35Yokoyama S.

The certainty of each inferred amino acid was expressed by its posterior probability. The ancestral amino acids of poorly aligned regions (i.e. residues corresponding to 2–8 and the last 27 of zebrafish SWS2) were inferred visually. Construction of the Ancestral SWS2 Opsin cDNA—The SWS2 cDNA of zebrafish (9Chinen A. Hamaoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and goldfish were cloned into the pMT5 (39Khorana H.G. Knox B.E. Nasi E. Swanson R. Thompson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7917-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) expression vector. We introduced point mutations into the pMT5 clones using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutated cDNAs were sequenced to confirm that no spurious mutations were incorporated. Sequencing was carried out using the Thermo Sequence Cycle Sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) with dye-labeled primers and the LI-COR 4200L-1 automated DNA sequencer. Visual Pigment Reconstitution—The pMT5 expression vector contains the last 15 amino acids of bovine rod opsin necessary for immunoaffinity purification by the 1D4 monoclonal antibody (40Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We transfected each pMT5-cDNA clone into cultured COS-1 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan), incubated the resuspended cells with 5 μm 11-cis-retinal (Storm Eye Institute, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), solubilized the cells with 1% dodecyl maltoside, and purified the resulting pigments using immobilized 1D4 (Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) as described previously (21Kawamura S. Yokoyama S. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of each pigment was recorded from 250 to 650 nm at 1-nm intervals using the Hitachi U3010 dual beam spectrometer at 20 °C. Five replicates were performed in the dark and five more after 3 min of light exposure using a 366 nm UV illuminator (model UVL-65 Blak-Ray Lamp, 100 V 0.16 A; UVP, Inc.) as described previously (21Kawamura S. Yokoyama S. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Savitzky-Golay's least squares smoothing method (41Gorry P.A. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 570-573Crossref Scopus (589) Google Scholar) was carried out for each absorbance curve using 100 repetitions to eliminate spurious spikes. All λmax values in this study were taken from spectra generated in dark conditions. We evaluated the time course of 11-cis-retinal dissociation from the zebrafish SWS2 pigment at 20 °C by adding hydroxylamine (pH 6.7) to the purified zebrafish SWS2 pigment at a final concentration of 20 mm. The pigment was exposed to light for 20 min after hydroxylamine bleaching. The light source was a 60-watt room lamp, and cut-off wavelengths below 440 nm were filtered with the Kodak Wratten Gelatin Filter No.3. Ancestral Pigment of Zebrafish and Goldfish SWS2—The ancestral amino acid sequence of the zebrafish and goldfish SWS2 opsins was estimated by using the PAML program with either the JTT or Dayhoff model of amino acid substitutions. Under both models, the average posterior probability over the entire amino acid sequence subjected to PAML analysis was 0.98. Amino acids with posterior probabilities less than 0.9 by either model are listed in Table I. There were two amino acid differences between the sequences inferred by the two models: glycine (JTT) and alanine (Dayhoff) at site 50 (designated G50A) and L85F. Fig. 2 shows the ancestral sequence inferred by the JTT model. From the ancestral SWS2 opsin, there were 24 amino acid differences in the goldfish SWS2 opsin and 42 differences plus one indel (in the amino terminus) in the zebrafish SWS2. We therefore used the goldfish SWS2 opsin cDNA as a template to create the ancestral opsin cDNA by substituting the 24 amino acids. We then reconstituted the ancestral photopigment (pigment ZG) with the A1 chromophore 11-cis-retinal, and measured the λmax to be 430 nm (Table II and Fig. 3). The pigment was shown to be photoreactive, exhibiting a λmax of 380 nm of all-trans-retinal upon light exposure (data not shown). The Dayhoff-predicted versions of the ancestral pigments were also reconstituted by introducing the G50A and L85F substitutions into the pigment ZG (ZG_G50A and ZG_L85F, respectively). Neither substitution affected λmax (430 nm, see Table II). These results indicate that a 14-nm blue shift and a 13-nm red shift occurred in the λmax of SWS2 pigments in zebrafish and goldfish lineages, respectively, after the separation of the two fish species.Table IAmino acid residues having less than 0.9 posterior probabilities by either JTT or Dayhoff model in ancestral sequence reconstruction of the SWS2 visual pigments of zebrafish and goldfishSiteJTTDayhoff3Phe (0.899)Phe (0.886)4His (0.760)His (0.875)15Ile (0.681)Ile (0.572)33Asn (0.769)Asn (0.882)34Ser (0.886)Ser (0.910)42Val (0.850)Val (0.903)50Gly (0.550)Ala (0.499)82Ala (0.852)Ala (0.823)85Leu (0.481)Phe (0.542)88Ile (0.664)Ile (0.564)92Ser (0.683)Ser (0.641)93Val (0.513)Val (0.550)99Phe (0.794)Phe (0.777)101Arg (0.735)Arg (0.817)162Ile (0.805)Ile (0.994)163Phe (0.521)Phe (0.429)217Ser (0.732)Ser (0.723)266Ala (0.773)Ala (0.827)281Glu (0.628)Glu (0.674) Open table in a new tab Table IIλmax values of current and ancestral SWS2 visual pigments of zebrafish and goldfish reconstituted in vitroPigmentλmax ± S.E.nmCurrentZebrafish416 ± 1.0aMeasured as described in Ref. 9Goldfish443 ± 0.0AncestralZG430 ± 0.3ZG_G50A430 ± 0.7ZG_L85F430 ± 0.0a Measured as described in Ref. 9Chinen A.

Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Cowing J.A. Poopalasundaram S. Wilkie S.E. Bowmaker J.K. Hunt D.M.

None of these mutations was detected between the zebrafish and ancestral SWS2 pigments (Fig. 2). To explore amino acid substitutions that can explain the 14-nm blue shift in zebrafish SWS2 pigment from ancestral pigment ZG, we first constructed three chimeric opsins: A(70)Z, Z(70)A(128)Z, and Z(128)A, using the restriction enzymes, BglII and BsaI (see Fig. 2), where amino acids 1–70, 71–128, and 129–347 of the zebrafish SWS2 opsin, respectively, were replaced with the corresponding segments of the ancestral opsin. The chimeric photopigments were reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal and absorption spectra were measured (see Table III for λmax values). Among the three chimeric pigments, pigments Z(70)A(128)Z and Z(128)A showed recognizable spectral shifts from the intact zebrafish pigment of +7 and +3 nm, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). The spectral shift by the pigment A(70)Z was +1 nm. When segment 1–128 of the zebrafish SWS2 opsin was replaced by the corresponding ancestral region [A(128)Z], the magnitude of the spectral shift was no different from that of Z(70)A(128)Z (+7 nm) (Table III), confirming that the spectral effect of segment 1–70 is very small. When segment 71–347 was replaced [Z(70)A], the λmax shift was +12 nm (Table III and Fig. 4C), slightly larger than the sum of the individual effects of the two segments 71–128 and 129–347, +10 nm, and closer to the net difference of 14 nm between the zebrafish and ancestral pigments. These results suggest that the majority of amino acid substitutions responsible for the blue-shifted λmax of the zebrafish SWS2 pigment were in the 71–347 region.Table IIISpectral effects of mutations introduced into the zebrafish SWS2 pigmentPigmentλmax ± S.E.Δλ from zebrafish SWS2nmChimeraA(70)Z417 ± 0.4+1Z(70)A(128)Z423 ± 0.8+7Z(128)A419 ± 0.4+3A(128)Z423 ± 0.4+7Z(70)A428 ± 0.7+12Mutant 71–128RBPaAmino acids located in the retinal binding pocketZF SWS2_S117A418 ± 0.4+2Non-RBPZF SWS2_S82A416 ± 0.80ZF SWS2_W85L417 ± 0.0+1ZF SWS2_V88I416 ± 0.00ZF SWS2_A97S417 ± 0.3+1ZF SWS2_Y99F418 ± 0.5+2ZF SWS2_K100N417 ± 0.3+1ZF SWS2_I108T417 ± 0.7+1ZF SWS2_G109A417 ± 0.5+1ZF SWS2_I119L416 ± 0.30Mutant 129–347RBPaAmino acids located in the retinal binding pocketZF SWS2_C295S419 ± 0.3+3a Amino acids located in the retinal binding pocket Open table in a new tab There are a total of 12 and 15 amino acid differences in segments 71–128 and 129–347, respectively, between the zebrafish and ancestral SWS2 opsins (Fig. 2). A study of the x-ray crystal structure of bovine rod opsin identified 27 amino acids as comprising the retinal binding pocket, located within 4.5 Å from the retinal (42Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies identified a total of 38 residues, including the above-mentioned 27, as surrounding the retinal (13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 43Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Among these, only residues 117 and 295, in the 71–128 and 129–347 segments, respectively, were different between the zebrafish and ancestral SWS2 opsins: serine in zebrafish and alanine in ancestral opsins at residue 117 (S117A) and C295S. Mutations S117A and C295S, introduced into the zebrafish SWS2 opsin, resulted in only +2- and +3-nm spectral shifts, respectively (Table III). However, the latter effect is of the same magnitude as that of the segmental replacement of residues 129–347 (Fig. 4, B and D). We therefore focused on the segment 71–128 and explored amino acid substitutions accounting for the 7-nm difference in which the segmental replacement resulted. All the remaining amino acid substitutions in transmembrane regions 2 and 3 (TM2 and TM3) in the 71–128 segment were introduced into the zebrafish SWS2 pigment one by one: S82A, W85L, V88I, A97S, Y99F, K100N, I108T, G109A, and I119L (Fig. 2). Individual spectral effects were all minor, ranging from 0 to +2 nm (Table III). However, the simple sum of these effects, +9 nm, was comparable with the segmental effect of +7 nm. Furthermore, the sum of all the substitutions in segments 71–128 and 129–347 was +12 nm, concordant with the effect of segmental replacement of 71–347 (Z(70)A in Table III). Although not all combinations of these mutations have been tested for the additivity of their spectral effects, we examined a double mutation, I108T/G109A, a triple mutation, I108T/G109A/S117A, and a quadruple mutation, I108T/G109A/S117A/C295S, and confirmed their linear additivity; their spectral shifts were +2, +5, and +7 nm, respectively. These results suggest that the blue shift of the spectral sensitivity from the ancestral to the current zebrafish SWS2 pigments was achieved by the accumulation of amino acid substitutions with individual minor spectral effects. Mutations in Goldfish SWS2—Among the known amino acid substitutions to exert spectral effects in SWS2 pigments, only S94A was observed between the goldfish and ancestral SWS2 pigments (Fig. 2). When introduced into the newt SWS2 pigment, S94A is known to exert a -14-nm spectral shift (13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and promised to explain the 13-nm difference between the goldfish (λmax 443 nm) and the ancestral (430 nm) SWS2 pigments. However, when introduced into the goldfish SWS2 pigment, S94A resulted in only a -3-nm shift (Fig. 5A and Table IV). We then tested all other amino acid substitutions in TM regions that alter either their electric charge or polarity: A52T, S80A, A87S, P92S, L116T, G124S, S163F, G217S, and S272A (Fig. 2). Among them, L116T caused a -6-nm shift (Fig. 5B and Table IV). Effects of other mutations were all minor (0–2 nm) (Table IV). However, the sum of all mutations, -12 nm, was comparable with the 13-nm difference between the goldfish and ancestral SWS2 pigments, suggesting that a red shift of the goldfish SWS2 pigment from the ancestral pigment was achieved in half by T116L and in half by accumulation of amino acid mutations, including A94S, with individual minor spectral effects.Table IVSpectral effects of mutations introduced into the goldfish SWS2 pigmentPigmentλmax ± S.E.Δλ from goldfish SWS2nmGF SWS2_A52T443 ± 0.00GF SWS2_S80A443 ± 0.00GF SWS2_A87S442 ± 0.0-1GF SWS2_P92SNo peak valueaNo recognizable absorption peak was observedGF SWS2_S94A440 ± 0.0-3GF SWS2_L116T437 ± 0.4-6GF SWS2_G124S441 ± 0.4-2GF SWS2_S163F444 ± 1.2+1GF SWS2_G217S443 ± 1.20GF SWS2_S272A442 ± 0.4-1a No recognizable absorption peak was observed Open table in a new tab Unique Shape of Absorbance Curve in Zebrafish SWS2—We have noticed that the absorbance curve of the zebrafish SWS2 pigment has a shoulder around 400 nm (Fig. 3). As far as we know, such a shoulder closely located to the λmax position has not been reported in other opsin-based vertebrate photopigments. To confirm whether this was due to spurious Schiff base linkages of 11-cis-retinal to proteins (including opsin) or contamination of non-retinal-based pigments having a 400-nm absorbance peak, we monitored the process of 11-cis-retinal dissociation from the zebrafish SWS2 pigment by hydroxylamine over time. Hydroxylamine cleaves Schiff base linkages of 11-cis-retinal and results in a free 11-cis-retinal oxime in solution and shows an absorption peak around 365 nm. As shown in Fig. 6, all absorbance curves, taken at different time points, crossed at a single point. This indicates that the retinal based pigment in this solution was homogenous and not a mixture of pigments having different rates of retinal dissociation. After completion of the dissociation by hydroxylamine followed by light exposure, we failed to see a shoulder at 400 nm (see curve 17 of Fig. 6) making it unlikely that non-retinal-based pigments (with 400 nm absorbance) were contaminated. In addition, only the SWS2 but no other visual pigments of zebrafish showed the 400-nm shoulder in our previous study (9Chinen A. Hamaoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the 400-nm absorbance ridge is a characteristic of the zebrafish SWS2 pigment. In the process of the mutagenesis experiments, we noticed that a single amino acid substitution (C295S) to the zebrafish SWS2, and a segmental replacement including this residue, abolished the absorbance ridge (Fig. 4D), but other point mutations did not. Therefore, the aberrant absorbance shape of the zebrafish SWS2 pigment was considered a result of the amino acid substitution, S295C. The peak absorption spectrum of the zebrafish blue-sensitive cone visual pigment, SWS2, is ∼30 nm shorter than that of the goldfish pigment, reflecting their different visual ecologies. These two species are phylogenetically close and are suitable for studying the evolutionary process of spectral differentiation. To study this evolutionary process, we inferred their ancestral amino acid sequence rather than just comparing the two sequences to clarify the identity of the mutations involved in spectral differentiation. Reconstitution of the ancestral pigment revealed that the spectral differences between the two current species was due in half to the short wavelength shift in the zebrafish pigment and in half to the long wavelength shift in the goldfish pigment. This was unexpected because a previous study suggested that the goldfish SWS2 retains the ancestral state of vertebrate SWS2 pigments (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, in the study, the goldfish pigment was the only fish pigment and other pigments studied were those of amphibians, a reptile, and birds (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present study, using seven SWS2 sequences of various fish species, expanded our view on the evolution of fish SWS2 pigments and suggests that fish SWS2 pigments, including goldfish, have experienced repeated changes of absorption spectra, possibly reflecting the great variability of their aquatic light environments (44Levine J.S. MacNichol Jr., E.F. Sci. Am. 1982; 246: 140-149Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis carried out in this study showed that S94A caused -3-nm spectral shift when introduced into the goldfish SWS2 pigment. This conflicts with a much larger (-14 nm) effect of the same mutation in the newt SWS2 pigment (13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that the effect of this mutation is heavily dependent on the background amino acid sequence. In the three-dimensional structure, residue 94 is located close to the counterion and Schiff base, and substitution at this location has been suspected to perturb the environment around the Schiff base or chromophore by two or more unidentified components (13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Dependence of the spectral effects of amino acid substitutions on background amino acid sequences has also been observed in SWS1 pigments (37Shi Y. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8308-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Prediction of λmax from amino acid sequences requires caution for the SWS2 system as well as for SWS1. When introduced into the goldfish SWS2, L116T exerts -6-nm effect and accounts for nearly half of the spectral difference from the ancestor. This location is one of the spectral tuning sites identified for SWS1 pigments, which exerts unrecognizable changes individually, but when combined with other mutations causes a significant synergistic spectral change (37Shi Y. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8308-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Perhaps because of the individual minor effects in SWS1 pigments or its locality outside the region surrounding the retinal, the residue 116 was not previously considered for mutagenesis experiments in SWS2 pigments (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Residue 116 is located near the counterion site 113 (glutamic acid) and is varied among the SWS2 pigments of vertebrates. Pigeon, chicken, and newt SWS2 pigments contain alanine at this location while many others contain threonine, and their relatively red-shifted λmax values (see Fig. 1) may also be associated with the residue at this site. In zebrafish, two sites in the retinal-binding pocket were found mutated, 117 and 295. Site 117 is highly conserved among vertebrate opsins: alanine in RH1, RH2, and SWS2 opsins, glycine in SWS1 opsins, and valine in M/LWS opsins. The A117G mutation is known to cause a -4-nm spectral shift when introduced into bovine RH1 (45Lin S.W. Kochendoerfer G.G. Carroll K.S. Wang D. Mathies R.A. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24583-24591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A serine residue at this site is unique to the zebrafish SWS2 opsin among all vertebrate visual opsins sequenced to date. Despite this uniqueness, the spectral effect of S117A was small (+2 nm) (Table III). The 295 site neighbors the chromophore binding site at 296 (lysine) and is also highly conserved among vertebrate opsins: serine in RH2, SWS2, and SWS1 opsins and alanine in RH1 and M/LWS opsins. The A295S mutation causes a -5-nm spectral shift when introduced into bovine RH1 (45Lin S.W. Kochendoerfer G.G. Carroll K.S. Wang D. Mathies R.A. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24583-24591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue at this site is also unique to the zebrafish SWS2 opsin. The S295C substitution in the zebrafish SWS2 not only shifts its λmax by 3 nm toward short wavelengths but also creates an absorbance ridge at ∼400 nm. This absorbance ridge broadens its spectral sensitivity toward shorter wavelengths. As far as we know, this is the first report of spectral shifts by changing the shape of absorbance curves. Although cysteine may affect the resonance by decreasing available protonation in the Schiff base region, thus providing a higher energy, it is not clear why the shoulder appears at 400 nm. The role of cysteine in this process and further details of its mechanism require additional studies. The shoulder is, however, unrecognizable by microspectrophotometry measurements of native photoreceptor absorbance (46Cameron D.A. Vis. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Microspectrophotometry is generally more susceptible to noise than in vitro measurements, and the shoulder we found in this study may be too subtle for microspectrophotometry to detect. In both goldfish and zebrafish, most of the mutations resulted in minor spectral shifts, the simple sum of which resembled the net spectral differences between the ancestral and current pigments. Although we have not rigorously tested the additivity of these effects by introducing all mutations simultaneously, the nearly additive nature of the individual spectral effects have been demonstrated for the SWS2 pigments (10Yokoyama S. Tada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Takahashi Y. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6025-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Results from the present study suggest that the λmax distribution of SWS2 pigments could be continuous rather than discrete, unlike M/LWS pigments. Investigation of visual pigments in other fish species inhabiting various light environments, together with the evolutionary engineering approach and ancestral pigment reconstitution, would greatly promote our understanding of the evolution of the visual system and the interaction of vision-environment relationships.

The cytoplasmic domain of its largest polypeptide subunit GpIbα possesses a binding region for filamin A, which links GpIb-IX-V to the platelet cytoskeleton. There is evidence that filamin A binding to GpIbα directs the surface expression of GpIb-IX. To investigate the mechanism of this effect, we examined GpIbα biosynthesis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably co-expressing wild-type or mutant GpIbα with GpIbβ, GpIX with and without filamin A. We observed that surface GpIbα expression is enhanced in CHO cells co-expressing human filamin A. In comparison with cells expressing only GpIbα, GpIbβ, and GpIX (CHO-GpIbα/βIX), lysates from CHO-GpIbα/βIX + filamin A-expressing cells showed greater amounts of immature, incompletely O-glycosylated and fully mature GpIbα, but lesser amounts of the ∼15-kDa C-terminal peptide released when the extracellular domain of GpIbα is cleaved by proteases. When filamin A binding is eliminated by truncation of GpIbα at C-terminal residue 557 or by a deletion between amino acids 560–570, the decreased synthesis of mature GpIbα is accompanied by decreased immature GpIbα and by an increased immunodetectable C-terminal peptide. The synthesis of mature GpIbα in CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells is eliminated by brefeldin A (which inhibits transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)) and restored by lactacystin (which inhibits proteasomal degradation).

Ib-IX-V complex is essential for von Willebrand factor-dependent platelet adherence and aggregation in the microvasculature and under conditions of pathologically elevated arterial wall shear rates (1Sadler J.E. Science. 2002; 297: 1128-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 3Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2003; 2: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is composed of four type I transmembranous polypeptides. The largest subunit GpIbα is disulfide-bonded to GpIbβ, and GpIb (used to designate the GpIbα/GpIbβ complex) is non-covalently linked to GpIX in a 1:1 stoichiometry; the GpIb-IX complex is linked non-covalently with GpV, with an apparent stoichiometry of 2 GpIb-IX complexes for every GpV molecule (4Berndt M.C. Shen Y. Dopheide S.M. Gardiner E.E. Andrews R.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). There are important post-translational modifications of the individual protein subunits of the complex that affect membrane anchoring (GpIbβ and GpIX are palmitoylated) and receptor function (the O-linked carbohydrate-rich domain of GpIbα comprises a rigid mucin-like structure that maintains length and effects platelet adhesion under pathologically elevated shearing stresses). In addition, the 96 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of GpIbα forms non-covalent bonds with the protein filamin A, and the GpIbα/filamin A interaction links the GpIb-IX-V complex to the platelet cytoskeleton. There is human genetic evidence that an abnormality in the expression of GpIbα, GpIbβ or GpIX, but not GpV, eliminates complex formation, resulting in the human bleeding disorder Bernard-Soulier syndrome (5López J.A. Andrews R.K. Afshar-Kharghan V. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 4397-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro analyses establish that complex assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that proper assembly serves to optimize GpIb-IX-V complex trafficking, including glycosylation (6Dong J.-F. Gao S. López J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31449-31454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Ulsemer P. Strassel C. Baas M.-J. Salamero J. Chasserot-Golaz S. Cazenave J.-P. De La Salle C. Lanza F. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 295-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it appears that intact complex assembly and proper trafficking and glycosylation through the ER and Golgi compartments are required for rendering the juxtamembranous extracellular region of GpIbα less susceptible to proteolysis, possibly because its covalent interaction with GpIbβ or its mucin-rich macroglycopeptide domain offers protection from degradation by extracellular proteases such as trypsin and calpain (8Strassel C. Pasquet J.-M. Alessi C. Juhan-Vague I. Chambost H. Combrié R. Nurden P. Bas M.-J. De La Salle C. Cazenave J.-P. Lanza F. Nurden A.T.

During the course of experiments using genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells co-expressing wild-type and mutant human GpIbα with wild-type human GpIbβ, GpIX, and filamin A, we observed that perturbations of the interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of GpIbα and its cytoskeletal partner filamin A affected surface expression of the GpIb-IX complex (9Feng S. Reséndiz J.C. Lu X. Kroll M.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2122-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This observation was similar to that made by Meyer et al. (10Meyer S.C. Sanan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using paired recombinant wild-type GpIb-IX/mutant filamin A or mutant GpIb-IX/full-length filamin A in filamin-deficient cells. In considering the mechanism of this effect, we hypothesized that filamin A binding to GpIbα regulates post-translational complex assembly and trafficking. Such a hypothesis is consistent with the results of two studies examining heterologous cell synthesis of recombinant GpIbα carrying a dinucleotide deletion in its transmembranous domain that, in humans, causes Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) (11Kenny D. Newman P.J. Morateck P.A. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2626-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Afshar-Kharghan V. López J.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation, which results in shortening of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GpIbα from 96 to 58 amino acids and eliminates its filamin A binding domain, prevents GpIbα from being expressed on the cell surface. Deficient “anchoring” of GpIbα to the cytoskeleton is considered to be a mechanism for this unique BSS phenotype. To investigate how the anchoring of GpIbα to filamin A regulates GpIb-IX complex assembly and surface expression, we examined the biosynthesis of wild-type and mutant human GpIbα in CHO cells co-expressing recombinant human GpIbβ, GpIX, and filamin A. Antibodies and Reagents—The antibody AN51, a monoclonal mouse IgG2a anti-human platelet GpIbα antibody that recognizes the ligand-binding domain was from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). WM23, a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the macroglycopeptide domain of GpIbα was kindly provided by Dr. Michael C. Berndt (Monash University, Victoria, Australia). Anti-GpIbα-C, a rabbit anti-peptide antibody corresponding to the C-terminal 15 residues of GpIbα was kindly provided by Dr. Xiaoping Du (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). Recombinant human filamin A cDNA in PREP4 vector was a gift from Dr. John Hartwig (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Recombinant human GpIbα, GpIbβ, and GpIX were kindly provided by Dr. J. A. López (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Brefeldin A, NH4Cl, leupeptin, chloroquine, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, EDTA, endoglycosidase H, and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from Sigma. Lactacystin and endoglycosidase D were from Calbiochem. The silver staining kit, ECL reagents, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and rainbow molecular weight standards were from Amersham Biosciences. Minimum essential medium α, fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, HT supplement, hygromycin B, Zeocin™, pcDNA™3.1/Zeo, and PCR superMix were from Invitrogen. Cell Culture and Transfections—CHO cells were maintained in minimum essential medium α containing 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 1× HT supplement at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with the cDNA coding for GpIbβ, GpIX, GpIbα, or filamin A using Lipofectamine. Stable clonal cell lines (CHO-GpIbβIX, CHO-GpIbα/βIX, CHO-GpIbα/βIX + filamin A) were established by selection in hygromycin B, Zeocin™, and G418, followed by limiting dilution. Levels of recombinant protein expression in the cell lines were measured by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The C-terminal mutations of GpIbα (the truncation at residue 594 or 557, the deletion between residues 560–570, and site-directed mutagenesis from residues RGS 557–559 to AGA 557–559) were constructed as described previously (9Feng S. Reséndiz J.C. Lu X. Kroll M.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2122-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Protein Immunoprecipitation, Separation, and Western Blot—Transfected CHO cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, detached in PBS containing 0.5% EDTA, and lysed during a 20-min incubation at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Samples were then sonicated briefly (∼5 s), cleared of insoluble debris by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and diluted with the same volume of ice-cold PBS to bring the final Triton X-100 concentration to 0.5%. GpIbα was immunoprecipitated by incubating the samples with 4 μg of mAb AN51 and 40 μl of Sepharose-conjugated protein A overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors, precipitated proteins were used for treatment of endoglycosidases or resuspended in 50 μl of sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded and separated by 7 or 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and visualized by either silver staining or Western blotting. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), (TBST) for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies WM23 or anti-GpIbα-C overnight at 4 °C, washed in TBST, and then followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Reactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Endoglycosidase Treatment—GpIbαβIX-transfected CHO cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antibody AN51. The precipitated proteins were resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were then incubated with endoglycosidase H or endoglycosidase D at a final concentration of 0.4 unit/ml enzyme for 12 h at 37 °C. Following the treatment, proteins were boiled again in sample buffer, separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, and blotted with antibody WM23. Blockade of Endoplasmic Reticulum to Golgi Transit and Inhibition of Lysosomal or Proteasomal Activity—Equal amounts of CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells were grown in 12-well tissue culture dishes to 80% confluence. Before treatment with inhibitors, cells were first washed twice with PBS and incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h. The serum-starved cells were then serum-repleted in medium containing either brefeldin A to block protein ER → Golgi transportation, lactacystin to inhibit proteasomal 20 S subunit activity, or leupeptin plus ammonia chloride (NH4Cl) to inhibit lysosomal protein degradation. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °Cand then lysed in 100 μl of sample buffer. The proteins were separated by 7 or 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted by WM23 or anti-GpIbα-C terminus antibodies. Flow Cytometry—The expression of the GpIbα/βIX complex on the cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry. To identify GpIbα, cells were washed with PBS, detached in EDTA, and incubated with 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AN51. Data Analysis—The quantitation of Western blot signals was made using a LKB Bromma Ultrascan XL enhanced laser densitometer (Amersham Biosceinces). Paired statistical analyses of data were performed using Sigma Plot software. Hamsters express filamin, but its primary structure has not been elucidated, and it does not cross-react with the antibody we use to detect human filamin A (9Feng S. Reséndiz J.C. Lu X. Kroll M.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2122-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To optimize our heterologous system for studying the biology of platelet GpIbα binding to filamin A, we engineered CHO cells to stably co-express human GpIbα, GpIbβ, GpIX, and filamin A. Fig. 1A shows that silver staining reports recombinant filamin A co-precipitating with GpIbα in CHO cells expressing the four polypeptides (CHO-GpIbα/βIX + filamin A) but that there is no detectable endogenous filamin band that co-immunoprecipitates with GpIbα in equal volumes of lysate from cells not expressing recombinant human filamin A (CHO-GpIbα/βIX). Fig. 1B shows that the surface expression of GpIbα, reported as fluorescence by flow cytometry, is nearly 1 log-order increased when filamin A is co-expressed with GpIbα, GpIbβ, and GpIX in CHO cells. The magnitude of the filamin A effect shown in Fig. 1B is almost identical to that previously reported by Meyer et al. (10Meyer S.C. Sanan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using GpIb-IX co-transfected with human filamin in a filamin-deficient melanoma cell line. The mechanism of the effect of filamin A on GpIbα is not understood, although it has been attributed to an indirect effect not requiring its binding to GpIbα (10Meyer S.C. Sanan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation, that filamin A binding regulates GpIb-IX complex trafficking, is also plausible, however, as published work has demonstrated an effect of filamin on the trafficking of furin (13Liu G. Thomas L. Warren R.A. Enns C.A. Cunningham C.C. Hartwig J.H. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1719-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), dopamine receptors (14Lin R. Canfield V. Levenson R. Pharmacology. 2002; 66: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and opioid receptors (15Onoprishvili I. Andria M.L. Kramer H.K. Ancevska-Taneva N. Hiller J.M. Simon E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 2003: 1092-1100Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we examined lysates from CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells without and with co-expressed filamin A for differences in the electrophoretic mobility of GpIbα detected by immunoblotting. Fig. 2A shows that lysates from CHO cells expressing filamin A with GpIb-IX have four bands that blot with the monoclonal antibody WM23 that recognizes the macroglycopeptide region of GpIbα. Based on previous work on GpIb-IX biosynthesis using pulse-chase methods, we deduce that the bands represent the following: 65 kDa, “immature” GpIbα (partially N-glycosylated but without any O-glycosylation); 85 kDa, partially O-glycosylated; 105 kDa, nearly fully O-glycosylated; 135 kDa, fully glycosylated mature GpIbα (6Dong J.-F.

De La Salle C. Cazenave J.-P. Lanza F. Nurden A.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4452-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To confirm the validity of these deductions, CHO-GpIbα/βIX lysates were subjected to endoglycosidase treatment before separations and immunoblotting. Fig. 2B shows that recombinant GpIb-IX from CHO cells without human filamin A is susceptible to digestion with endoglycosidase H, which cleaves high mannose-containing N-glycosidic bonds from polypeptides residing in the ER or ER/pre-cis Golgi compartment. In contrast, there was no cleavage of GpIbα from lysates digested with endoglycosidase D, which cleaves maturing N-glycosylated polypeptides containing five mannose residues after processing is the cis- or trans-Golgi apparatus (data not shown). These results prove that GpIbα from CHO cells without co-expressed filamin A resides mainly in the ER and that the 65 kDa band prominently displayed in the immunoblots from CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells + filamin A reports an immature form of GpIbα that is partially N-glycosylated (7Ulsemer P. Strassel C. Baas M.-J. Salamero J. Chasserot-Golaz S. Cazenave J.-P. De La Salle C. Lanza F. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 295-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prove that results in Fig. 2 represent changes in GpIbα, rather than changes in antibody binding separate from GpIbα maturation, we examined lysates from CHO-GpIbα/βIX without and with co-expressed filamin A using an antibody that specifically recognizes the C-terminal 15 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of GpIbα (16Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that this anti-GpIbα C terminus antibody weakly reports mature and immature GpIbα and strongly reports a band of ∼15 kDa. Fig. 3B shows that the 15-kDa band is relatively increased in lysates from CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells without human filamin A. Based on this molecular weight, which is calculated to approximately equal the molecular weight of the 125 amino acid fragment, containing the cytoplasmic, transmembranous and a short extracellular stub, of GpIbα released by proteolytic digestion of reduced GpIbα (17Fox J.E.B. Aggerbeck L.P. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4882-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that this 15-kDa band reports a C-terminal fragment of GpIbα produced by the degradation of GpIbα. To buttress results in Figs. 1, 2, 3 suggesting that filamin A binding to GpIbα affects surface expression by directing trafficking to the Golgi and away from a degradative pathway, we turned to additional genetic and pharmacological approaches. Fig. 4 shows the results of experiments using the genetic approach, in which the processing of GpIbα was examined by low exposure immunoblotting in CHO cells co-expressing filamin A and GpIbα/βIX rendered incapable of binding filamin because of either a truncation or a deletion in the cytoplasmic domain of GIbα. Fig. 4A shows that a truncation at residue 557 (which eliminates filamin binding) but not at residue 594 (which has no effect on filamin binding) decreases the expression of mature and immature GpIbα in CHO-GpIbα/βIX + filamin cell lysates. Of note, the quantity of the immature polypeptide is decreased further than the quantity of the mature GpIbα, and the quantity of both polypeptides begins to approach that observed in CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells without co-expressed filamin A. Because the truncation mutants do not bind the C terminus antibody used to identify the 15-kDa degradation fragment shown in Fig. 3, we used two alternative mutants to corroborate data in Fig. 4A and to examine the theory that filamin A binding to GpIbα directs its trafficking away from a degradative pathway. Fig. 4B shows normal processing when CHO-GpIbα/βIX + filamin A cells express substitutions in the primary filamin binding domain of GpIbα that do not affect filamin A binding (m557–559). In contrast, when filamin A binding is eliminated by deleting C-terminal residues 560–570 (d560–570), there is decreased mature and immature GpIbα and an increase in its 15-kDa C-terminal fragment. Results of Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 support the hypothesis that filamin A binding to GpIbα occurs in the ER and stabilizes nascent GpIbα/βIX trafficking to the cell surface. To cross-examine this hypothesis from an alternative perspective, we performed a series of experiments using pharmacological probes for ER to Golgi transit (brefeldin A, Ref. 18Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar), post-ER lysosomal degradation (leupeptin + NH4Cl, Refs. 6Dong J.-F. Gao S.

In these experiments, cells deprived of serum for 24 h were treated simultaneously for 6 h with serum plus the pharmacological probe. Fig. 5 shows that brefeldin A eliminates mature GpIbα synthesis and enhances its breakdown to the 15-kDa C-terminal fragment. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin enhances mature GpIbα synthesis but has no measurable effect on the amount of the immunodetectable C-terminal 15-kDa fragment. Consistent with previously reported data using pulse-chase methodology, the combination of leupeptin + NH4Cl has little to no effect on the maturation or degradation of GpIbα (6Dong J.-F. Gao S. López J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31449-31454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the conclusion that the proteasome is the major route of degradation for uncomplexed GpIbα (19Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 20Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of megakaryocyte GpIb-IX-V is required for the production of functional platelets. BSS is caused by a genetic defect leading to decreased production of GpIbα, GpIbβ, or GpIX. Although BSS is rarely encountered, research on persons affected by BSS has provided important insights into the biology of the GpIb-IX-V complex. Among the ∼100 families worldwide with members suffering from BSS, there are two families with unique mutations affecting the capacity of the cytoplasmic domain of GpIbα to anchor to filamin connected to the cortical skeleton and cytoskeleton (11Kenny D. Newman P.J. Morateck P.A. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2626-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Afshar-Kharghan V. López J.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations cause frame shifts that affect the hydrophobicity of the transmembranous domain and introduce a stop codon that truncates the cytoplasmic domain by 38 residues, thereby eliminating filamin A binding. This results in greatly decreased surface expression of GpIbα. Although it is has been reasonably hypothesized that decreased surface expression results from either unstable plasma membrane insertion, poor cytoskeletal anchoring, and/or increased susceptibility to proteolysis, none of these effects adequately explains why there was strikingly decreased total synthesis of GpIb-IX when these mutant polypeptides were co-expressed with GpIbβ and GpIX in CHO cells (11Kenny D. Newman P.J. Morateck P.A. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2626-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Afshar-Kharghan V. López J.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now present data indicating that one explanation for the decreased synthesis of GpIbα in these BSS variants is that they lack an essential component for normal post-translational trafficking, filamin A binding. Our data support the hypothesis that GpIb-IX is directed toward a productive biosynthetic pathway by filamin A binding to the cytoplasmic domain of GpIbα in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results are consistent with our (9Feng S. Reséndiz J.C. Lu X. Kroll M.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2122-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) observations and the observations of others (10Meyer S.C. Sanan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that the co-expression of recombinant filamin A with recombinant GpIbα, GpIbβ, and GpIX increases the quantity of immunodetectable GpIb-IX in heterologous cells. Our results, however, are in disagreement with the conclusion suggested by Meyer et al. (10Meyer S.C. Sanan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that the effect of filamin A “does not appear to involve... direct interaction with receptors.” Data presented in Fig. 4 indicate that only mutations that specifically affect filamin A/GpIbα interactions, without gross disturbances in secondary structure or dismantling the binding of a 14-3-3ζ adapter protein to GpIbα, prevent proper trafficking of nascent GpIbα through the ER and Golgi. The effect is not absolute, however, and it is likely that measurements of mature GpIbα using flow cytometry and immunoblotting, such as were employed by Meyer et al. (10Meyer S.C. Sanan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), could overlook the relative decrease in GpIbα biosynthesis resulting from disrupting the filamin A/GpIbα interaction. The persistent biosynthesis of mature GpIbα in the absence of GpIbα/filamin A interactions is evidence that there are redundant pathways and multiple chaperones involved in the trafficking of nascent GpIbα from the ER to the Golgi to the plasma membrane, only one of which is modulated by filamin A binding. In contrast to that observed with mature GpIbα, the expression of immature 65-kDa GpIbα is greatly decreased in cells expressing mutant GpIbα incapable of binding to filamin A (Figs. 2, 3, 4). This observation provides an important clue about where the filamin A/GpIbα interaction is established and how it directs trafficking. Fig. 2B demonstrates that the 65-kDa immature polypeptide appears identical to the 65-kDa protein created when mature GpIbα is subjected to deglycosylation with endoglycosidase H, which removes N-linked high mannose sugar residues from the ER compartment. The absence of this band from CHO cell lysates in which GpIbα/filamin A interactions are disrupted supports the conclusion that filamin A binds GpIbα in the ER and stabilizes it such that it undergoes normal N-linked glycosylation. Not all GpIbα is “held” in the ER by filamin A binding, and some normal processing occurs, but the majority of immature GpIbα molecules not bound to filamin A are either rapidly degraded and/or moved centrifugally into the Golgi and then onto the plasma membrane. The degradation of uncomplexed GpIbα is not very well understood, although there is pharmacologic evidence for a minor lysosomal-mediated pathway (6Dong J.-F. Gao S. López J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31449-31454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and immunofluorescence evidence for a major ER-mediated pathway (7Ulsemer P. Strassel C. Baas M.-J. Salamero J. Chasserot-Golaz S. Cazenave J.-P. De La Salle C. Lanza F. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 295-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because our experimental system shows increased amounts of a 15-kDa C-terminal GpIbα peptide from cells in which the filamin A/GpIbα interaction is perturbed, we considered it to be a marker useful for exploring the routes by which uncomplexed GpIbα is degraded. Not surprisingly, we observed that brefeldin A mimics (and exaggerates) the effects of disrupting filamin A/GpIbα interactions, leading to almost no synthesis of mature GpIbα and to a nearly 2-fold increase in the quantity of the 15-kDa C-terminal peptide in CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GpIbα retained by the ER is shunted to a degradative pathway. To identify this degradative pathway, we examined how specific inhibitors of lysosomal proteases or proteasomal proteases affect the quantities of immunoreactive mature GpIbα and its C-terminal peptide fragment. We observed that only proteasomal inhibition restored the productive synthesis of GpIbα in CHO-GpIbα/βIX cells without filamin A. Somewhat surprisingly, however, we found that proteasomal inhibition had no measurable effect on the amount of C-terminal peptide (Fig. 5). This result indicates that the majority of the 15-kDa C-terminal peptide is generated by GpIbα degradation outside of the lysosomal and proteasomal compartments. It is likely that it derives from degradation of cell surface-expressed GpIbα rendered more susceptible to extracellular proteases because it has lost its cytoskeletal tether. Such an effect accounts, in least in part, for the decreased expression of GpIbα in BSS variants caused by the 38 amino acid GpIbα C-terminal truncation (11Kenny D. Newman P.J. Morateck P.A. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2626-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Afshar-Kharghan V. López J.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by a single amino acid substitution (Asn-64→ Thr) in the extracellular domain of GpIbβ (8Strassel C. Pasquet J.-M. Alessi C. Juhan-Vague I. Chambost H. Combrié R. Nurden P. Bas M.-J. De La Salle C. Cazenave J.-P. Lanza F. Nurden A.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4452-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have provided evidence that the biosynthesis of GpIb-IX is enhanced by GpIbα binding to filamin A. We have also provided evidence that uncomplexed GpIbα is retained by the ER and undergoes ER-directed proteasomal degradation. Finally, we have provided additional evidence that some GpIbα not bound to filamin is directed to the cell surface but that GpIb-IX without its cytoskeletal connections may be more susceptible to extracellular proteolysis. Although novel, these results are not entirely unexpected, as there are data that other proteins are chaperoned toward productive biosynthesis by filamin binding (13Liu G. Thomas L. Warren R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2088979807,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) is known to be one of the primary causative cytokines inflicting the characteristic damage to hepatocytes seen in alcoholic liver disease. TNF activates both cell survival and death-inducing signaling pathways. The balance between these two prongs determines the fate of the cell and the onset of disease. Ethanol exposure has been shown to alter mitochondrial function, decreasing their threshold for injury. Importantly, mitochondrial injury is a necessary end point of TNF-induced cell killing. It has been shown that ethanol exposure increases the sensitivity of hepatocytes and HepG2E47 cells to TNF-mediated death. The cumulative and terminal effect of the increased sensitivity to TNF caused by ethanol is an induction of a mitochondrial permeability transition. TNF brings about the mitochondrial permeability transition in ethanol-exposed cells due to amplification in the activity of the p38 stress kinase and a diminution in the activity of the antiapoptotic Akt/PKB kinase. The present report identifies an increase of PTEN expression in ethanol-exposed cells as the main causative factor in altering the balance between prosurvival and prodeath signals initiated by TNF. Suppression of the elevated PTEN levels found in ethanol-exposed HepG2E47 cells through the use of RNA interference reversed the ethanol-induced alterations to TNF signaling, resulting in a preservation of mitochondrial function and cell viability."

Ordahl C.P. Science. 1984; 226: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms of TnT have been identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The expression of more than one cardiac TnT isoform was first identified in chicken. Subsequently, multiple cardiac TnT isoforms were found in different species including the rabbit, rat, mouse, bovine, and human heart, and the number of isoforms expressed varies among different species. In the human heart, alternative splicing of exons 4 and 5 generates up to four different isoforms (TnT1–TnT4) with varying electrophoretic mobility. The four isoforms differ by the presence or absence of exons 4 and 5. Cardiac TnT1 has both exons 4 and 5, in cardiac TnT2 exon 4 is missing, in cardiac TnT3 exon 5 is missing, and in cardiac TnT4 both exons 4 and 5 are missing (2Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J.

This mutation leads to a deletion of the amino acid lysine at position 210 in exon 13. None of the individuals affected with DCM exhibited ventricular hypertrophy, a hallmark feature of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In affected family members, the TnT-ΔK210 mutation caused early-onset ventricular dilation. It also caused a high incidence of sudden cardiac death in both infants and adults. Two children (age, 1 month and 8 months, respectively) who died suddenly had a clinical diagnosis of infantile cardiomyopathy. Li et al. (9Li D. Czernuszewicz G.Z. Gonzalez O. Tapscott T. Karibe A.

Fourteen living members of the family clinically manifested DCM, predominantly in the second decade of their life. Five children (between the ages of 1 and 15 years) in this family died of DCM. Also, 17 members of this family died before genotypic analysis was carried out, presumably due to DCM. It is not known how many out of these 17 members were children. Previously, we investigated the functional properties of TnT DCM mutations in the adult isoform of TnT (TnT3) (10Venkatraman G. Harada K. Gomes A.V. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Because a different TnT isoform is present in the embryonic heart (TnT1) and because both these DCM mutations cause infantile cardiomyopathy, we created mutations in the TnT1 isoform to elucidate the behavior of the mutations in the fetal TnT isoform. In addition to a different TnT isoform, a different TnI isoform is expressed in the embryonic heart. Both slow skeletal TnI (ssTnI) and cardiac TnI (cTnI) are expressed in the heart during development (11Hastings K.E. Koppe R.I. Marmor E. Bader D. Shimada Y. Toyota N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19659-19665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, only ssTnI is present during the 12th week of gestation (12Bodor G.S. Oakeley A.E. Allen P.D. Crimmins D.L. Ladenson J.H. Anderson P.A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the human heart, ssTnI and cTnI mRNA and protein are both expressed in the neonate, and only cTnI is expressed in the adult heart. However, ssTnI expression persists in the human ventricle well into the first year of life (13Hunkeler N.M. Kullman J. Murphy A.M. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Bhavsar P.K. Dhoot G.K. Cumming D.V. Butler-Browne G.S. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although ssTnI and cTnI serve the same role in the regulation of muscle contraction by inhibiting the actomyosin ATPase activity, their responses to Ca2+ and H+ ions are markedly different (15Solaro R.J. Van Eyk J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 217-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In order to understand the behavior of DCM mutants in fetal troponin, we made the mutations in fetal TnT (TnT1) and utilized ssTnI instead of cTnI in our assays. Because the isoforms used in the assays represent the troponin isoforms in the fetal heart, these studies were designed to reveal how DCM mutations affect the functional properties of troponin in the fetal heart. The cDNA for human adult cardiac troponin T (TnT3-WT) was previously cloned in our laboratory by reverse transcription-PCR using a template of total RNA from human myocardium and oligonucleotide primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ regions of the respective coding sequences (16Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The TnT1 isoform, which is the primary TnT isoform in the embryonic heart, was constructed using TnT3-WT as the template. Two mutations, R141W and ΔK210, were introduced in TnT1 by the method of sequential overlapping PCR using the following primers (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

Amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into the Nco-BamHI site of the pet-3d expression vector. Clones that contained the correct inserts were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. Recombinant TnT3-WT, TnT isoform (referred to as TnT1-WT), and TnT1-DCM mutants were expressed in BL21 bacterial cells. Standard methods were utilized for purification of various TnTs (18Pan B.S.

Briefly, bacterially expressed TnT was passed through an S-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–600 mm KCl. The fractions containing TnT were loaded onto a fast flow Q-Sepharose column and eluted with a 0–500 mm salt gradient. The purity of the protein was >90%. The proteins were further passed through a DE-52 column that gave >95% pure protein. The purity of the proteins was verified on SDS-PAGE after each purification step. The cDNAs for human cTnI and ssTnI were previously cloned in our laboratory by reverse transcription-PCR using a template of total RNA from human myocardium and oligonucleotide primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ regions of the respective coding sequences (20Lang R. Gomes A.V. Zhao J. Housmans P.R. Miller T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11670-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 bacterial cells were transformed with pET-3d constructs containing cTnI or ssTnI. The proteins were initially purified on an S-Sepharose column, and the purity of cTnI and ssTnI was determined by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing cTnI or ssTnI were purified using a TnC affinity column and eluted with a linear gradient consisting of 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 m urea and 3 mm EDTA and 6 m urea. The purity of the proteins was verified on SDS-PAGE. This experiment was used to measure the steady-state isometric force and the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development at both pH 6.5 and pH 7.0. The experiment was performed after displacement of the endogenous Tn complex and replacement with either TnT3-WT, TnT1-WT, or TnT1 DCM mutants and reconstitution with the human cTnI·TnC or human ssTnI·TnC complex. This protocol is well established in our laboratory (2Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Cardiac Skinned Muscle Preparation—Porcine hearts obtained from the slaughterhouse were transported to the laboratory in an ice-cold oxygen-saturated solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm NaHPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cardiac muscle was isolated from the left ventricle and chemically skinned by incubation with 50% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100 in the pCa 8.0 relaxing solution. The composition of the relaxing solution was 10–8 m Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 7 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mm creatinine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase, ionic strength = 150 mm, at 4 °C for 24 h. This partially skinned preparation was then stored at –20 °C in the same solution without Triton X-100 and dissected into small bundles (100–150 μm in diameter) before each experiment. TnI·TnC Complex Formation—The cardiac TnC was mixed with either ssTnI or cTnI in a molar ratio of 1:1.25 and dialyzed in a solution containing 6 m urea, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 m KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After overnight dialysis, the TnI·TnC complex was dialyzed in solution containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and decreasing KCl concentrations (1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 m). The excess TnI that precipitated from the complex was removed by centrifugation. The TnI·TnC complex was run on SDS-PAGE to verify stoichiometry before storage at –70 °C. Measurement of the Ca2+ Dependence of Force—Porcine muscle fiber bundles (a bundle of three to five fibers isolated from a batch of glycerinated fibers) were mounted on a force transducer and treated with the pCa 8.0 relaxing solution containing 1% Triton X-100 for ∼1h.The average length and diameter of the fibers selected for the experiment were ∼1.2–1.5 mm and 120–150 μm. The composition of pCa 8.0 solution was 10–8 m Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 7 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 20 mm creatinine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase, ionic strength = 150 mm. This permeabilizes the muscle membrane and allows us to gain access to the myofilament proteins. Subsequently, the fibers were transferred to pCa 8.0 solution without Triton X-100 and then into pCa 4.0 solution for the initial force determination. The composition of the pCa 4.0 solution is the same as that of the pCa 8.0 solution, except that the Ca2+ concentration was 10–4 m. To determine the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, the fibers were gradually exposed to the solutions of increasing Ca2+ concentrations, from pCa 8.0 to pCa 4.0. To displace the endogenous Tn complex, the fibers were incubated in a solution containing 250 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and ∼0.8–1 mg/ml TnT3-WT, TnT isoform, or TnT DCM mutants for 1 h at room temperature. After a 1-h incubation, the fibers were incubated in fresh TnT protein for another hour. This was done to ensure the displacement of endogenous troponin from the fibers. Displaced fibers were then washed with the same solution without the protein (10 min at room temperature) and tested for the Ca2+-unregulated force that developed due to the absence of the endogenous porcine cTnI and TnC. The Ca2+ regulation of steady-state force was restored with a preformed human cTnI·TnC complex. The reconstitution with the TnI·TnC complex (30 μm) was performed in the pCa 8.0 solution for ∼1.5 h at room temperature for the force to reach a stable level. Control fibers were run in parallel and treated with the same solutions without the proteins. The final Ca2+ sensitivity of force development was determined after human cTnI·TnC reconstitution as described before by exposing the fiber to increasing Ca2+ concentration from pCa 8.0 to pCa 4.0. The data were analyzed using the Hill equation in Sigma plot. The Hill equation is written as follows: % relative force = 100 × [Ca2+]nH/([Ca2+]nH + pCa50nH), where pCa50 determines Ca2+ concentration of the solution in which 50% of force is produced, and nH is the Hill coefficient. The native proteins used are rabbit skeletal actin, porcine cardiac myosin, and porcine cardiac tropomyosin. Rabbit skeletal F-actin was prepared as described by Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (21Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Jakubiak M. Drabikowski W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Porcine cardiac myosin was purified as described by Murakami et al. (22Murakami U. Uchida K. Hiratsuka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Porcine cardiac Tm was prepared from pig ventricles according to Potter (23Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85 (Pt B): 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recombinant TnT, TnI, and TnC were used to make functional troponin complexes. The ATPase assays were performed with rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin (3.5 μm) containing porcine cardiac Tm (1 μm) and pre-formed Tn complexes (1 μm) as described previously (2Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The concentration of porcine cardiac myosin was 0.6 μm. All ATPase assays were performed in the presence (0.5 mm CaCl2) or absence (1 mm EGTA) of Ca2+. The ATPase reactions (in 10 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, and 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) were initiated with 2.5 mm ATP. After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The inorganic phosphate that was released was measured according to the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (24Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of the differences between mean values was performed by Student's t test. Values are presented as mean ± S.D. Alterations in the Ca2+ Sensitivity of Force Development Caused by TnT1 DCM Mutations at pH 7.0—In order to study the functional differences between TnT3 and TnT1, the endogenous porcine troponin complex was exchanged with either TnT3-WT or TnT1-WT and reconstituted with human cTnI·TnC, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction was measured at pH 7.0 and analyzed using the Hill equation. Before troponin exchange, the Ca2+ dependence of force development was measured, and there was no statistically significant difference in either pCa50 or Hill coefficient between the different fibers used (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, porcine fibers treated with TnT1-WT increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with TnT3-WT-treated fibers. This shift of +0.12 pCa unit is consistent with previous results obtained from our laboratory (2Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) for the same proteins. Also, the Hill coefficient (an indicator of the cooperativity) significantly increased in TnT1 isoform-treated fibers. When porcine cardiac fibers were exchanged with TnT1-R141W and TnT1-ΔK210 (Fig. 1B), both of the DCM mutations decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with TnT1-WT. The Ca2+ unregulated force produced by fibers treated with TnT isoforms and mutants is shown in Table I. Although the ΔK210 mutant had a lower Ca2+ unregulated force than its respective TnT-WT, this difference was not statistically significant. Previous studies from our laboratory (10Venkatraman G. Harada K. Gomes A.V. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41670-41676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed that in the TnT3 isoform, only the TnT3-ΔK210 decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development (and not TnT3-R141W) when compared with the TnT3-WT. However, in the TnT1 isoform, both mutations decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, and the magnitude of the shift in Ca2+ sensitivity was increased compared with what was observed in the TnT3 isoform. There was no significant difference in the Hill coefficient between TnT1-WT and TnT1 DCM mutant-treated fibers.Table ISummary of pCa-force relationship curves in fibers reconstituted with either cardiac TnI·TnC or ssTnI·TnC complex at pH 7.0TnTTnIpCa50nH% Ca2+ unregulated forceMaximum forcen%TnT3-WT5.39 ± 0.021.82 ± 0.1193.4 ± 4.265.4 ± 2.87TnT3-R141WaValues are compared against TnT3-WT-cTnI.cTnI5.35 ± 0.031.74 ± 0.0492.2 ± 5.471.8 ± 10.14TnT3-ΔK210aValues are compared against TnT3-WT-cTnI.5.27 ± 0.02bp < 0.01.1.74 ± 0.1189.6 ± 6.246.8 ± 1.1bp < 0.01.4TnT1-WTaValues are compared against TnT3-WT-cTnI.5.51 ± 0.03bp < 0.01.2.05 ± 0.15cp < 0.05.91.8 ± 4.772.6 ± 3.5cp < 0.05.5TnT1-R141WdValues are compared against TnT1-WT-cTnI.cTnI5.30 ± 0.03ep < 0.001.1.94 ± 0.1393.8 ± 3.171.2 ± 1.24TnT1-ΔK210dValues are compared against TnT1-WT-cTnI.5.22 ± 0.02ep < 0.001.1.9 ± 0.2187.9 ± 5.354.6 ± 5.5ep < 0.001.4TnT3-WT5.55 ± 0.022.22 ± 0.1794.6 ± 3.284.9 ± 2.54TnT1-WTfValues are compared against TnT3-WT-ssTnI.ssTnI5.64 ± 0.03bp < 0.01.1.84 ± 0.1193.6 ± 4.996.2 ± 2.5bp < 0.01.4TnT1-R141WgValues are compared against TnT1-WT-ssTnI.5.46 ± 0.03ep < 0.001.2.09 ± 0.1593.1 ± 3.586.1 ± 1.93TnT1-ΔK210gValues are compared against TnT1-WT-ssTnI.5.47 ± 0.02ep < 0.001.2.08 ± 0.0989.8 ± 4.370.3 ± 2.6ep < 0.001.3a Values are compared against TnT3-WT-cTnI.b p < 0.01.c p < 0.05.d Values are compared against TnT1-WT-cTnI.e p < 0.001.f Values are compared against TnT3-WT-ssTnI.g Values are compared against TnT1-WT-ssTnI. Open table in a new tab In the next series of experiments, porcine cardiac fibers were treated with either TnT3-WT, TnT1-WT, or TnT1 DCM mutants and reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC instead of cTnI·TnC. Results depicted in Fig. 1C show that the pCa50 of TnT3-WT-treated fibers reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC is 5.55 ± 0.02. However, when cTnI·TnC was used to reconstitute TnT3-WT-treated fibers, the pCa50 observed was 5.39 ± 0.02 (Fig. 1A). The increase in Ca2+ sensitivity (+0.16 pCa unit) observed upon ssTnI·TnC reconstitution is due to the well-known effect of ssTnI to lower the threshold for Ca2+ activation of force development (25Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Lond.). 1999; 517 (Pt 1): 143-157Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The pCa-force relationship in fibers exchanged with TnT1-WT and reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC is also depicted in Fig. 1C. The Ca2+ sensitivity of force development significantly increased in TnT1-WT-treated fibers compared with TnT3-WT-treated fibers reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC. Previous results show that (Fig. 1A) TnT1 isoform is more sensitive to Ca2+ than TnT3 upon reconstitution with cTnI·TnC. Our results show that both the TnT1 isoform and ssTnI contribute to the additive increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of force development in porcine cardiac fibers. We also measured the effect of the DCM mutations in the TnT1 isoform reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC in fiber studies. The pCa50 value for fibers treated with TnT1-R141W and TnT1-ΔK210 and reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC was 5.46 ± 0.03 and 5.47 ± 0.02, respectively (Fig. 1D; Table I). A significant decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity was observed for both the TnT1 DCM mutants compared with TnT1-WT. Thus, the effect of TnT1-WT and ssTnI in increasing Ca2+ sensitivity of force development is altered in the presence of TnT DCM mutations. Ca2+ Regulation of Steady-state Force Development with TnT1-DCM Mutants at pH 7.0—In fiber studies, we also measured the isometric force produced under activating conditions (pCa 4.0). The maximal force recovered by fibers treated with TnT3-WT and reconstituted with cTnI·TnC was ∼80%. The average rundown of the control fibers treated with buffers (without proteins) for the same time as the experimental fiber was 11–14%. Our results showed that the maximal force recovered by fibers exchanged with TnT1-WT and reconstituted with cTnI·TnC was significantly higher than fibers exchanged with TnT3-WT (Fig. 2A; Table I). The TnT1-R141W-treated fibers recovered 71% maximal force. Comparison of Ca2+ activated maximal force in the fetal versus adult TnT isoform indicates that the R141W mutation behaves similar to the wild type in both the fetal and adult isoform. On the other hand, the ΔK210 mutation decreased Ca2+ activated maximal force in both the fetal and adult TnT isoforms (Table I). Fig. 2B illustrates the Ca2+ activated maximal force achieved in fibers treated with TnT3-WT, TnT1-WT, and TnT1 DCM mutants and reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC. The maximal force recovered for fibers treated with TnT3-WT was ∼85%. When the same TnT3-WT-treated fibers were reconstituted with cTnI·TnC, the maximal force recovered was 65% (Fig. 2A). Therefore, our results indicate that ssTnI is able to markedly increase the amount of maximal force recovered, in addition to increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. The maximal isometric force obtained for TnT1-WT-treated fibers reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC was 96%. This is a significant increase compared with 73% force recovered when TnT1-WT-treated fibers were reconstituted with cTnI·TnC (Fig. 2A; Table I). Our results indicate that the maximal recovered force is the highest when ssTnI is in combination with TnT1-WT rather than TnT3-WT. TnT1-R141W-treated fibers did not show significant changes in maximal force compared with TnT1-WT in the presence of ssTnI·TnC. However, in the ΔK210 mutation-treated fibers, we observed a significant decrease in the maximal force recovered (96% for TnT1-WT versus 70% for TnT1-ΔK210) when reconstituted with ssTnI·TnC. Reconstituted Actomyosin ATPase Assays on TnT1 DCM Mutations—It is well known that TnI by itself inhibits ATPase activity and that the addition of TnC relieves this inhibition. When TnT is added, there is an activation of actomyosin ATPase activity that is Ca2+-dependent (28Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A illustrates the ATPase inhibition in the absence of Ca2+ (–Ca2+) in Tn complexes containing cTnI·TnC. The actomyosin ATPase activity in the absence of human cardiac troponin complex was considered to be the basal activity. In the absence of Ca2+, ATPase was maximally inhibited at 2 μm [Tn]. Tn complexes containing TnT3-WT were able to inhibit 86.4% of the basal activity. TnT1-WT-containing complexes were not able to inhibit as well as TnT3-WT (75 ± 2% for TnT1-WT versus 86.4 ± 2% for TnT3-WT). This difference in inhibition was found to be statistically significant by Student's t test (p < 0.001). Both DCM mutations R141W and ΔK210 in the TnT1 isoform inhibited ATPase activity similar to TnT1-WT at the various Tn concentrations. In order to understand how the DCM mutations would affect ATPase inhibition in the fetal heart at the level of troponin, we utilized ssTnI·TnC to make troponin complexes containing TnT3-WT, TnT1-WT, and TnT1 DCM mutants. In the absence of Ca2+, when increasing concentrations of Tn complexes are added, the basal activity starts to fall. At 2 μm, TnT3-WT·ssTnI·TnC complex was able to inhibit 60.5% of the basal ATPase activity. When TnT3-WT was complex"

The prime example is the tandem-repeat array-deleted MUC1/Y isoform, which is expressed both as mRNA and protein (24Zrihan-Licht S. Vos H.L. Baruch A. Elroy-Stein O. Sagiv D. Keydar I. Hilkens J.

Gynecol. Oncol. 2001; 83: 343-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The MUC1/Y protein is similar to MUC1/REP in that it also contains the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, yet it lacks the central tandem-repeats and their flanking sequences (Fig. 1A). Further studies reveal another MUC1 isoform, MUC1/X, that is also devoid of the tandemrepeat array (29Baruch A. Hartmann M. Zrihan-Licht S. Greenstein S. Burstein M. Keydar I. Weiss M. Smorodinsky N. Wreschner D.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This isoform is generated by an alternative splicing event that has the same splice donor site as MUC1/Y but utilizes an alternative splice acceptor site located 54 nucleotides upstream to that used by MUC1/Y. Downstream to the splice acceptor sites, the MUC1/Y and MUC1/X isoforms retain the same reading frame as the repeat array-containing MUC1 transmembrane protein (29Baruch A. Hartmann M. Zrihan-Licht S. Greenstein S. Burstein M. Keydar I. Weiss M. Smorodinsky N. Wreschner D.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Additional MUC1 mRNA splice forms have the potential to generate MUC1 gene-derived proteins that differ at their N and C termini (27Obermair A. Schmid B.C. Packer L.M. Leodolter S. Birner P. Ward B.G. Crandon A.J. McGuckin M.A. Zeillinger R. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Ligtenberg M.J. Gennissen A.M. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The splice forms that alter the predicted site of signal peptide cleavage generate N-terminal diversity, whereas splice forms that either truncate or alter the reading frame of the cytoplasmic domain accomplish C-terminal diversity. Alternative splicing may also generate MUC1 proteins that are secreted from the cell rather than being tethered at the cell membrane (4Wreschner D.H. Hareuveni M. Tsarfaty I. Smorodinsky N. Horev J.

Numerous splice variants have also been proposed for MUC4 (33Moniaux N. Escande F. Batra S.K. Porchet N. Laine A. Aubert J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4536-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We report here an alternatively spliced MUC1 mRNA that deletes the central tandem-repeat array. Following the discovery of the tandem-repeat array lacking the MUC1/Y isoform, this finding is not totally unexpected. What is surprising is the fact that downstream to the splice acceptor site, the usual MUC1 reading frame has undergone a +1 reading frameshift. This creates the potential for a novel MUC1 protein, designated here as MUC1/ZD, that comprises a completely new C-terminal protein sequence different from all of the other MUC1 proteins (MUC1/ZD GenBank™ accession numbers AY466157 (locus) and AAR28764.1 (protein)). The existence of this MUC1 isoform as an expressed protein has not been previously documented. Here we show the expression at the protein level of a frameshifted MUC1 protein, the MUC1/ZD isoform. RT-PCR of MUC1 mRNA—Poly(A)-rich RNA extracted from breast cancer cells was reverse-transcribed (SuperscriptII, Invitrogen) using the reverse antisense oligonucleotide primer 5′-TGGCACATCACTCACGCTGACGTCTGAGATC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 1243–1272 in the MUC1/REP sequence, for numbering see Fig. 3B in Ref. 4Wreschner D.H.

MUC1-specific RT-PCR products were subcloned into M13, and sequencing was accomplished using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Cloning of MUC1/ZD—For plasmid propagation in bacteria, the MUC1/ZD cDNA (Fig. 1) was subcloned into the ppolyII vector (34Lathe R. Vilotte J.L. Clark A.J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cloning of MUC1/ZD in Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Expression Vector—DNA coding for MUC1/ZD was inserted into the pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting pGEX-2T-MUC1/ZD plasmid codes for a protein that comprises (from its N terminus) GST followed by a thrombin cleavage site, the MUC1/ZD sequence, and terminates with a protein kinase A phosphorylation site. Purification of Recombinant Bacterial GST-MUC1/ZD Fusion Protein—Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the recombinant bacterial GST-MUC1/ZD fusion protein was purified from the supernatant using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. When pure MUC1/ZD protein was required, the GST fusion protein was incubated with thrombin (1 cleavage unit/100 μg) for 16 h at 25 °C. Antibodies: Rabbit Polyclonal Anti-MUC1/ZD Antibodies—Three female rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of recombinant GST-MUC1/ZD protein mixed with adjuvant. Affinity-purified anti-MUC1/ZD antibodies were obtained using a MUC1/ZD affinity column prepared with Affi-Gel-10 beads (Bio-Rad). Mouse Monoclonal Anti-MUC1/ZD Antibodies—The purified recombinant MUC1/ZD protein was first coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The MUC1/ZD-keyhole limpet hemocyanin complex was emulsified in full Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice. Sera were spun at 500 × g for 5 min, diluted in 5% milk in PBS/Brij, and analyzed by Western blotting against recombinant MUC1/ZD. Hybridoma Formation—Hybridomas were prepared by fusion of immune splenocytes with the NS-O myeloma cell line, kindly provided by C. Milstein (35Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12666) Google Scholar), and screened by an ELISA. Hybridoma supernatants were tested against wells of ELISA plates coated with either GST-MUC1/ZD or GST-MUC1/N-terminal fusion proteins. The MUC1/N-terminal protein extends from MUC1 residue Ser24 to Pro128. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies. Protein A-Sepharose Purification of ZUM12D8/15 and ZUM7E7 Anti-MUC1/ZD Monoclonal Antibodies—ZUM12D8/15 and ZUM7E7 anti-MUC1/ZD (anti-MUC1/ZD) and anti-MUC1-tandem-repeat array H23 are all Igγ1 and were purified using protein A-Sepharose. Fluorescent labeling and biotin conjugation of antibodies was done as described (Molecular Probes and Pierce, respectively). ELISA for Determining MUC1/ZD Protein Concentration—ELISA immunoassay plates (Costar) were coated with purified ZUM7E7 followed by washing with PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) and blocking with PBS-Tween 20 + 5% skimmed milk (Blotto). Doubling dilutions of either recombinant MUC1/ZD or sample to be analyzed were diluted with Blotto and applied to wells. Following incubation, samples were removed and wells were washed four times with PBS-Tween 20. Biotinylated ZUM12D8 then was added (5 μg/ml incubated for 30 min) followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. SDS-PAGE—SDS-polyacrylamide gel for protein separation was performed as described previously (36Weber K. Pringle J.R. Osborn M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE Diagonal Gel Electrophoresis—Samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE were resolved in two dimensions following a modification of a described previously procedure (37Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The first dimension was performed under non-reducing conditions. For the second dimension, the desired lanes were excised from the first gel, incubated with SDS loading buffer with or without 100 mm dithiothreitol, and reloaded horizontally on a second gel. Transfer of Proteins to Nitrocellulose Membranes and Immunoblotting Analysis—Proteins, separated on SDS-PAGE, were electrotransferred at 0.5 A for 2 h to a nitrocellulose filter paper in transfer buffer according to Gershoni (38Gershoni J.M. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1988; 33: 1-58PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were blocked in 5% skimmed milk followed by incubation with primary antibody. Bound primary antibody was detected with a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Purification of Proteins from SDS-PAGE Gels and Protein Iodination—Proteins were extracted from the acrylamide gel as described previously. The 60–65-kDa regions were excised from the gel, and proteins were eluted by shaking in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) followed by acetone precipitation and renaturation of the precipitated proteins. Purified proteins were incubated with 125I-conjugated Bolton-Hunter reagent (200 mCi) for 15 min on ice. The reaction was terminated by the addition of glycine, and the solution was passed through a Sephadex G-50 column to remove free iodine. Immunoprecipitation—Immobilized antibody complexes were prepared by incubating protein A (PAA Repligen) with 5–10 μg of antibody followed by incubation at 4 °C. Incubation of cell lysate with a nonrelevant antibody-PAA complex yielded precleared lysates that were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with the specific antibody-PAA complex. Following washing, the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Expression of MUC1/ZD-Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusion Protein in Eucaryotic Cells—MUC/ZD cDNA was inserted into the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) harboring the cytomegalovirus IE promoter. In this expression system, the open reading frame codes for a MUC/ZD-enhanced GFP fusion protein in which MUC/ZD is located N-terminal to GFP. Plasmids harboring the MUC/ZD-enhanced GFP-coding sequence were used for transient transfection of HEK293 cells. Immunohistochemical Staining of Frozen Sections—Thawed frozen sections were fixed in acetone and blocked with PBS containing 2.5% skimmed milk and 50% normal mouse serum. The slides then were incubated with the fluorescently labeled antibodies followed by washing, air-drying, mounting, and analysis by fluorescent or confocal laser microscopy. A Tandem-Repeat Array-lacking MUC1 mRNA with a +1 Frameshifted 3′ End—The splicing event that generates MUC1/Y (Fig. 1A2) spliced out the central tandem-repeat array and its immediate flanking sequences. RT-PCR identified an additional alternatively spliced tandem-repeat array-lacking MUC1 mRNA termed here as MUC1/ZD (Fig. 1A3). The MUC1/ZD mRNA isoform utilized a splice donor site identical to that used by MUC1/Y and could have generated a protein at its N terminus identical to the transmembrane MUC1/Y protein, including the signal peptide. As a consequence of alternate splice acceptor usage and in contrast to MUC1/Y, the MUC1/ZD reading frame distal to the splice acceptor site was +1 frameshifted (Fig. 1, A3 and B). MUC1/ZD mRNA 3′ to the MUC1/ZD termination codon was identical to that of the MUC1/Y and MUC1/REP sequences. The MUC1/ZD C-terminal unique region spanned 43 amino acids and was completely different from any other known MUC1 protein. In contrast to the transmembrane MUC1/REP and MUC1/Y proteins, MUC1/ZD did not contain a transmembrane domain. MUC1/ZD Protein Expression in Western blots—Western blots of tissue lysates prepared from human tumor samples were probed with antibodies generated against bacterial recombinant GST-MUC1/ZD protein. The expected size of the MUC1/ZD protein (73 amino acids) predicted that it should migrate in the region just above the 6-kDa marker protein. Immunoreactive bands migrating with this molecular weight were observed in three of eight tissue samples analyzed (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 4, and 7; samples 1 and 4 are from colon tumors, and sample 7 is from breast tumor). We do not know whether higher MUC1/ZD expression in colon tumor tissue, as compared with breast tumor tissue, is a general finding, and this will require a larger study beyond the scope of the present work. Competing MUC1/ZD protein abrogated immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B, GST-MUC1/ZD). The addition of the peptide TTTKSCRETFLK, an immunogenic MUC1/ZD epitope, in a Western blot analysis also competed out immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B, peptide). Two splice variants, AY327597 and AY327598, that are similar yet different from MUC1/ZD appear in the data base. These variants have the potential to code (following signal peptide cleavage) for ∼11.5-kDa (105 amino acids) and 15-kDa (135 amino acids) proteins. These variants do not contain the MUC1/ZD-specific C-terminal octamer sequence GQDLWWYN and instead continue (after the MUC1/ZD sequence WASPILSS (see Fig. 1) for an additional 40 or 70 amino acids (GenBank™ accession numbers AY327597 and AY327598, respectively)). The molecular mass of the MUC1/ZD protein observed here (∼7–8 kDa) correlates well with the expected size of the MUC1/ZD protein and is considerably less than the expected masses of these two variants. Reprobing of the blot with anti-MUC1 cytoplasmic domain antibodies demonstrates immunoreactive bands migrating between 25 and 30 kDa (Fig. 2A, lower panel, lanes 2 and 5, with lesser amounts observed in lanes 3 and 7). These bands represent the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain-containing cleavage products, reflecting MUC1/REP expression. The expression of the MUC1/ZD protein did not correspond with the expression of the MUC1/REP protein, and only one tissue sample (Fig. 2, lane 7) showed expression of both the MUC1/ZD and MUC1/REP proteins. MUC1/ZD Protein Expression by Immunohistochemical Staining—Immunohistochemical analysis substantiated MUC1/ZD protein expression in human tissues and demonstrated the expression of the MUC1/ZD protein in breast tumor tissue (Fig. 3A). The addition of the immunizing MUC1/ZD protein abrogated immunohistochemical reactivity (Fig. 3B), supporting specificity of antibody staining. In line with these findings, the addition of GST protein itself had no effect on immunoreactivity (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated MUC1/ZD expression at the protein level in human tissues. The MUC1/ZD Protein Exists as a Disulfide-linked Oligomer—The unique MUC1/ZD 43 amino acid C-terminal domain contained three cysteine residues (Fig. 1B, highlighted amino acid residues) that may form intramolecular and/or intermolecular disulfide bonds. To test for this possibility, the lysate of a tissue known to express the MUC1/ZD protein was analyzed under both reducing and non-reducing conditions and then was subjected to a Western blot analysis. All of the samples for these analyses were prepared with buffer containing iodoacetamide. Under reducing conditions, the tissue lysate displayed an immunoreactive band migrating just above the 6-kDa marker protein (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Under non-reducing conditions, the low molecular mass species (6–7 kDa) was no longer seen (Fig. 4A, lane 1′). In its place, a distinct immunoreactive band migrating at ∼64 kDa was observed. To detect the small MUC1/ZD monomeric protein, Western blots described above (and below) (Fig. 4, C–E) were done with high percentage (12.5–15%) acrylamide gels. Although advantageous for the resolution of small proteins, considerable stacking and piling up of higher molecular weight proteins occurs in such gels. In Western blots, this could result in artifactual bands representing proteins that are nonspecifically immunoreactive. To address this possibility, MUC1/ZD-positive and negative samples (as determined by Western blots of reduced samples) were reassessed under non-reducing conditions with a lower percentage (10%) acrylamide gel. Immunoblotting with anti-MUC1/ZD antibodies demonstrated a strong 64-kDa immunoreactive band in the MUC1/ZD-positive sample (Fig. 4B, lane 1). No immunoreactivity was seen with the MUC1/ZD-negative sample (Fig. 4B, lane 2). No significant additional nonspecific immunoreactive bands were observed. These data indicated that the 64-kDa band represents the MUC1/ZD protein. The additional bands appearing in high percentage acrylamide gels probably represented proteins that, because of protein stacking and piling up, reacted nonspecifically. This conclusion is supported by immunoprecipitation experiments described below. Proteins extracted from two tumor tissue lysates, one considered a known MUC1/ZD-positive sample and the other a MUC1/ZD-negative sample, were analyzed under identical non-reducing gel electrophoretic conditions. Proteins migrating in the 64-kDa region were eluted from the gel and radioiodinated, and equivalent levels of radioactivity (from both samples) were immunoprecipitated using anti-MUC1/ZD antibodies. Immunoprecipitation revealed a 64-kDa band only in the MUC1/ZD-expressing sample (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Partial reduction of the immunoprecipitated MUC1/ZD 64-kDa protein complex resulted in a ladder of radioactively labeled bands (Fig. 4D, lane 1′) that probably reflected MUC1/ZD oligomers containing different numbers of monomeric subunits that were disulfide-bonded to each other. Regarding their actual molecular mass, disulfide-bonded proteins often migrate anomalously on SDS-PAGE. This could explain why observed distances between labeled bands (Fig. 4D, lane 1′) do not in all cases correlate with the expected 7-kDa size of a MUC1/ZD monomer. Alternatively, the MUC1/ZD complex may comprise additional non-MUC1/ZD proteins. The 64-kDa MUC1/ZD protein was analyzed next by gel electrophoresis performed in two dimensions. Two identical lanes were analyzed in the first dimension under non-reducing conditions. Following electrophoresis, one lane was taken and placed horizontally on a new gel and analyzed in the second dimension, once again under non-reducing conditions. The second lane was soaked in reducing sample buffer and analyzed on a new gel under reducing conditions. The two gels were blotted and probed with anti-MUC1/ZD. If the 64-kDa MUC1/ZD protein is not disulfide-bonded, it should appear in both Western blots at a position located on the diagonal of the two-dimensional blot. On the other hand, if the 64-kDa MUC1/ZD protein is a disulfide-bonded oligomer of a 6–7-kDa MUC1/ZD monomer, it should appear on the diagonal only in the non-reduced second gel. In the reduced second dimension gel, it would appear at a location below the diagonal and correspond to migration of a 6–7-kDa protein. This is indeed the case (Fig. 4, E1 and E2, compare spots designated by arrowheads).

https://openalex.org/W2006323034,"Transected axons can regenerate beyond the site of injury in the peripheral but not in the central nervous system (CNS). Increasing evidence implicates inflammatory processes as modulators of axon regeneration after injury. In this study, we addressed a possible role of the matricellular glycoprotein osteopontin (OPN) using crush lesions of the optic and sciatic nerve as models of central and peripheral axotomy, respectively. OPN was strongly expressed by macrophages at the crush site in the optic but not sciatic nerve, indicating fundamental differences in the molecular programming of macrophages in both systems. Functionally, OPN exerted potent growth-inhibitory effects in an in vitro assay of axon outgrowth. Therefore, OPN expression by lesion-associated macrophages may contribute to the nonpermissive nature of the adult CNS preventing axonal regeneration following injury."

In this process, the antigen binding domains of Ig and TCR chains that are encoded by germline variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are rearranged to produce functional B or T cell receptors (1Bassing C.H.

For IgH and TCRβ chains, V, D, and J gene segments are involved whereas for IgL and TCRα chains, V and J gene segments take part in the recombination event (4Tonegawa S.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 890-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). V(D)J recombination is known to be stage-specific within a given lymphoid lineage, and the antigen receptors are expressed from only one of the two alleles; the phenomenon called allelic exclusion (7Lansford R.

Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). At the TCRβ locus, the recombination occurs during DN (CD4-CD8-CD44-CD25+) stage of thymocyte development (9Godfrey D.I. Kennedy J. Mombaerts P. Tonegawa S. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4783-4792PubMed Google Scholar). V(D)J recombination is mediated by lymphoid and non-lymphoid-specific factors as well as cis regulatory elements (10Gilfillan S. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1993; 261: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The lymphoid-specific factors of the recombination machinery include recombination activating genes (RAG) 1 and 2, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) (6Schlissel M.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 890-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Gilfillan S. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Benoist C. Mathis D.

Besides lymphoid-specific factors, non-lymphoid-restricted factors have also been implicated in the regulation of the recombination process. Among these, proteins that are involved in DNA double-strand break repair also play a critical role in the recombination events. These include Ku-80, XRCC4 protein, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (12Brown M.L. Franco D. Burkle A. Chang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition to activating transcription of germline gene segments, cis regulatory elements also participate in recombination (8Sleckman B.P. Gorman J.R. Alt F.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Sikes M.L. Gomez R.J. Song J. Oltz E.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that deletion of the germline promoter PDβ1, upstream of the Dβ1 gene segment in the murine TCRβ locus (16Whitehurst C.E. Chattopadhyay S. Chen J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Whitehurst C.E. Schlissel M.S. Chen J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) not only resulted in reduction of Dβ1 germline transcription but also reduced the rearrangement of Dβ1 (15Sikes M.L. Gomez R.J. Song J. Oltz E.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sleckman B.P. Bardon C.G. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the germline transcription and rearrangement of Dβ2, Jβ2, and Vβ gene segments remain unaffected by the deletion of the PDβ1 promoter. Similarly, the enhancer at the TCRα locus, Eα, is essential for rearrangement of all Jα gene segments, whereas for proximal Jα gene segments T early α promoter is required (19Lauzurica P. Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transcriptional enhancers such as Eα, Eβ, Eμ, and Eκ are also shown to be essential for recombination of their respective genomic loci as well as minilocus recombination substrates (20Bories J.C. Demengeot J. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7871-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Chen J. Young F. Bottaro A. Stewart V. Smith R.K. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4635-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Besides promoters and enhancers, MARs (matrix-associated regions) are the cis regulatory elements that contribute in the regulation of TCRβ gene rearrangement and transcription. MARs, though being distinct from promoters and enhancers, are often closely associated with these regulatory elements (22Ferrier P. Krippl B. Blackwell T.K. Furley A.J. Heikyung S. Winoto A. Cook W. Hood L. Costantini F. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Hood L. Rowen L. Koop B.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 758: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MARs are commonly located at the boundaries of transcription units often flanking enhancer-like regulatory sequences (24Mirkovitch J. Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), particularly those lying in the antigen receptor gene loci, such as the Igκ light chain gene locus, IgH heavy chain gene locus (25Cockerill P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), TCRβ gene locus (26Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1256-1267PubMed Google Scholar), TCRα/δ gene locus (27Zhong X.P. Carabana J. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11970-11975Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and CD8α gene locus (28Banan M. Rojas I.C. Lee W.H. King H.L. Harris J.V. Kobayashi R. Webb C.F. Gottlieb P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18440-18452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MARs help the cell type-specific expression of genes by residing close to enhancers as well as by synergistically acting with them (29Forrester W.C. van Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), thus maintaining some chromatin domains in condensed inactive structures and others in decondensed transcriptionally active structures. MARs flanking the enhancers in the immunoglobulin or T cell receptor genes are known to function in association with their specific MAR-binding proteins such as Cux (30Zong R.T. Scheuermann R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24010-24018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and SATB1 (31Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Maass K. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12005-12010Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Earlier, we reported a novel MAR-binding protein, SMAR1, interacting with MARβ (32Chattopadhyay S. Kaul R. Charest A. Housman D. Chen J. Genomics. 2000; 68: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a MAR flanking 5′-end of the TCRβ enhancer (Eβ) (33Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29838-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SMAR1 is the first known MAR-binding protein that functions as a candidate tumor suppressor by interacting with and activating p53, thereby regulating the cell cycle (34Kaul R. Mukherjee S. Ahmed F. Bhat M.K. Chhipa R. Galande S. Chattopadhyay S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of SMAR1 at the TCRβ locus, we have generated SMAR1 transgenic mice. Here, we show that overexpression of SMAR1 severely reduces the frequency of cells expressing the commonly used Vβs (Vβ5.1/5.2, Vβ8.1/8.2, and Vβ8.3) including Vβ13. Accompanied with reduced transcription, there is a significant impairment in V(D)J gene rearrangement of these specific Vβs. In vitro results demonstrate that SMAR1 strongly reduces transcription mediated by the Eβ enhancer. A mild perturbation in the thymocyte development is observed at the early DN stage in SMAR1 transgenic mice. Taken together, the data indicate that SMAR1 regulates V(D)J recombination by modulating the function of the TCRβ enhancer. Generation of SMAR1 Transgenic Mice—For generating SMAR1S transgenic mice, SMAR1-expressing vector, pBK-CMV-SMAR1S was used where SMAR1 is under the control of the CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). The construct was first linearized with MluI and ApaLI, giving rise to a 3.8-kb fragment that contains the CMV promoter along with 1.8 kb of a full-length alternatively spliced form of SMAR1 (SMAR1S). The insert was purified on agarose gel, followed by DNA extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was resuspended at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. DNA was microinjected into the fertilized pronucleus of fertilized eggs derived from F-2 generation of (C57BL/6 X SJL) mice at 4 ng/μl concentration using a Nikon micromanipulator. After injection, the eggs were transferred into the oviduct of a 0.5-day pseudopregnant foster CD-1 female mice. Analysis of smar1 Transgene by Southern Hybridization—To identify the presence of SMAR1, tail DNA was prepared from mice following standard protocols. Briefly, a 2-mm tail biopsy was incubated in high salt digestion buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 16 h at 55 °C. The lysates were processed for DNA isolation by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. For Southern analysis, 15–20 μg of DNA were subjected to restriction digestion with BamHI-HindIII or EcoRI-HindIII enzymes. The digested DNAs were fractionated on a 0.9% agarose gel, followed by denaturation and neutralization. DNA was transferred to Zeta-probe filters (Bio-Rad) under vacuum (Bio-Rad 785 model vacuum blotter). The filters were prehybridized for 4 h, followed by overnight hybridization with the CMV probe. Filters were washed twice for 10 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Hybridization signals were detected by phosphorimaging and autoradiography. RT-PCR Analysis—The smar1 transgene was detected by performing RT-PCR on total cell lysates from thymus, spleen, and lymph node of transgenic mice as well as the littermate control. The primers used were: SMAR1–7: 5′-GCATTGAGGCCAAGCTGCAAGCTC; SMAR1–8: 5′-CGGAGTTCAGGGTGATGAGTGTGAC; m-β-actin-a: 5′-TACCACTGGCATCGTGATGGACT; m-β-actin-b: 5′-TTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCAAT. RT-PCR assays were done as described previously (34Kaul R. Mukherjee S. Ahmed F. Bhat M.K. Chhipa R. Galande S. Chattopadhyay S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) except that the cDNA was amplified for 27–30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min). RT-PCR products were then separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The band intensities corresponding to the RT-PCR products were quantified using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad) and normalized with respect to the β-actin product. Probes and Primers—The DNA probe (CMV probe) used to screen the transgenic mice was obtained by restriction digestion of pBK-CMV-SMAR1S plasmid with BamHI-NdeI that generated a 0.6-kb fragment specific only for the CMV promoter. For TCRβ gene rearrangement PCRs, the probes used were: TCRβ1 probe corresponding to the Jβ1.6 fragment, obtained by the PCR amplification with the Dβ1-Jβ1 primers; TCRβ2 probe corresponding to Jβ2.6 fragment resulting from the PCR amplification with the Dβ2-Jβ2 primers; and Thy1 probe generated by isolating the PCR fragment obtained from amplification with Thy1 primers. The PCR amplification of the indicated probes was followed by their gel purification (Qiagen gel extraction kit). All the probes were labeled using the Random Primed labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) and [α-32P]dCTP (BARC). PCR primers used were as follows: Dβ1: 5′-AGCTTATCTGGTGGTTTCTTCCAGC; Dβ2: 5′-GTAGGCACCTGTGGGGAAGAAACT; Jβ1: 3′-CTGAAGAAAGGCATTCTGTGTCCAG; Jβ2: 3′-TGAGAGCTGTCTCCTACTATCGATT; Thy1-F: 5′-CCATCCAGCATGAGTTCAGC; Thy1-R: 3′-GCATCCAGGATGTGTTCTGA; Vβ4: 5′-GAAGCCTCTAGAGTTCATGT; Vβ6: 5′-GTATCCCTGGATGAGCTGGTATCAGCA; Vβ5.1:5′-GTCCAACAGTTTGATGACTATCAC; Vβ5.2: 5′-CAGATTCTGGGGTTGTCCAGTCTCCAA; Vβ6: 5′-GTATCCCTGGATGAGCTGGTATCAGCA; Vβ8.1: 5′-GTGACATTGAGCTGTCACCAGACT; Vβ8.2: 5′-CCTCATTCTGGAGTTGGCTACCC; Vβ8.3: 5′-AACACATGGAGGCTGCAGTCACCCAAA. PCR Amplification for Detection of TCRβ Rearrangement—PCRs for TCRβ rearrangements along with Thy1 as a control were performed using genomic DNA of thymus from control and transgenic mice. The primers and PCR conditions used were as described under “Experimental Procedures” (34Kaul R. Mukherjee S. Ahmed F. Bhat M.K. Chhipa R. Galande S. Chattopadhyay S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A brief initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min was followed by 25 cycles with the following steps: 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 56 °C for 2 min, extended at 68 °C for 3 min. PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, blotted onto Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad) followed by Southern analysis. The PCR blots were first hybridized with either the TCRβ1 or TCRβ2 probe, then stripped and rehybridized with Thy1 probe. The blots were exposed as described (35Alvarez J.D. Anderson S.J. Loh D.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1191-1202PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wolfer A. Wilson A. Nemir M. MacDonald H.R. Radtke F. Immunity. 2002; 16: 869-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar); that is, for 30 min (DJβ), 2 h (VDJβ), and 1 h (Thy 1). Flow Cytometry and Antibodies—Single cell suspensions were prepared in RPMI medium from thymus, spleen, lymph nodes of transgenic mice as well as their age-matched control. A total of 5 × 105 cells were spun at 1200 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, followed by washing twice with FACS buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% sodium azide). Nonspecific binding of antibodies to the cells was prevented by preincubating cells with 30 μg/ml of normal goat serum (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India) for 30 min on ice with intermittent shaking. This was followed by staining cells with appropriate combinations of FITC-or PE-conjugated antibodies for 45 min on ice with intermittent tapping. The monoclonal antibodies used for FACS staining were purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). These were as follows: anti-CD3ϵ-PE (145-2C11), mouse Vβ TCR screening panel (BD PharMingen) containing monoclonal antibodies which recognize mouse Vβ2, 3, 4, 5.1, and 5.2, 6, 7, 8.1 and 8.2, 8.3, 9, 10b, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 17a T-cell receptors, anti-CD4-PE (GK1.5), anti-CD8-PE (53–6.7), anti-CD44-PE (IM7), anti-CD25-PE (PC61), anti-CD8-FITC (53–6.7) and anti-CD25-FITC (7D4). The isotype control antibodies, either FITC- or PE-conjugated, used were: α-mouse, α-rat, or α-hamster. To analyze DN thymocytes, BD™ IMAG anti-mouse CD4, and anti-mouse CD8 particles (BD Biosciences) were used to deplete CD4- and CD8-positive cells from the total thymocyte population. Dead cells and debris were removed by appropriate gating of FSC and SSC. After surface staining, the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and were fixed with 1% p-formaldehyde. Around 10,000 live cells (propidium iodide negative) were collected for each sample using a FACS Vantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Purification of Double-Negative Thymocytes—Total thymocytes were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The blocking of cells was performed with rat serum followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. The contaminating double-positive thymocytes were eliminated by magnetic depletion with BD™ IMAG anti-mouse CD4 or CD8 antibodies. The purified DN (lineage-negative) thymocytes were then stained with CD44-FITC (BD PharMingen) and CD25-PE. The cells were washed with FACS buffer followed by fixation with 1% p-formaldehyde. The cells were then analyzed by FACS as mentioned before. Northern Blot Hybridization—Total cellular RNA was isolated from thymi of transgenic as well as control mice by a one-step acid guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol method using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), precipitated with ethanol, and quantitated by spectrophotometry. Twenty micrograms of RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde denaturing gel and blotted onto Zeta-probe membrane followed by Northern analysis. The blots were then probed with Vβ4, Vβ5.1, Vβ8.1, Vβ8.2, Vβ8.3, and β-actin probes. The probes for all the Vβs were isolated from respective plasmids clones by EcoRI-BamHI digestions. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Transient transfection assays were performed in T cell line (4980) using luciferase reporter constructs Vβ13- Eβ, Vβ13- MARβ, Vβ13-MARβ-Eβ that were driven by the Vβ13 promoter (53). Vβ13-Eβ contains the 550-bp core Eβ enhancer whereas Vβ13-MARβ contains a 170-mer sequence of MARβ upstream of the reporter gene. In Vβ13-MARβ-Eβ construct, there is an additional 1-kb fragment within which MARβ and Eβ spans for about 170 and 550 bp, respectively (33Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29838-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For Vβ14 clones, a 1.2-kb BglI-BglII fragment that spans the Vβ14 promoter and was isolated and blunt-ended using Klenow enzyme. The fragment was then cloned either in the vector alone or upstream of either Eβ enhancer or MARβ-Eβ. The cells were transfected by Lipofectamine, employing variable amounts of expression plasmids containing the luciferase reporter gene. Two micrograms of pRL-CMV (Renilla luciferase reporter DNA) were included in all transfections and used to normalize the transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was assessed using the dual luciferase assay reporter kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the luciferase activity was measured using Fluoroskan Ascent Luminometer (Labsystems). For all the luciferase assays, the data shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Analysis of the Transgene in Mice Expressing SMAR1—Previously, we have shown that within a 100-kb region of the TCRβ locus, there are 11 hypersensitive sites (Fig. 1A) (26Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1256-1267PubMed Google Scholar). Among these sites, HS1/MARβ is a major DNase I hypersensitive site that is strongly induced during the CD4-CD8- (DN) to CD4+CD8+ (DP) stage of thymocyte differentiation (26Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1256-1267PubMed Google Scholar, 33Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29838-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MARβ, a matrix-associated region located 400-bp upstream of the TCRβ enhancer (Eβ), associates with two MAR-binding proteins SMAR1 and Cux (Fig. 1A and Refs. 32Chattopadhyay S. Kaul R. Charest A. Housman D. Chen J. Genomics. 2000; 68: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 33Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29838-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). During transition from DN to DP stage of thymocyte development, there is a halt in TCRβ gene rearrangement at the DP stage during which MARβ is strongly induced, and a parallel up-regulation in SMAR1 expression was observed (26Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C. Schwenk F. Chen J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1256-1267PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chattopadhyay S. Kaul R. Charest A. Housman D. Chen J. Genomics. 2000; 68: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of SMAR1 in V(D)J recombination and T cell development, we generated SMAR1 transgenic mice using a eukaryotic expression vector carrying SMAR1 cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1B). SMAR1 transgene incorporation into the genome was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1C). Upon hybridization with CMV probe, one major band of 3.8–4.0 kb was generated. Among a number of positive lines, two independent SMAR1 transgenic lines named T-12 and T-15 were used for breeding purposes (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 6). Because most results were similar in both transgenic lines, we have presented the data obtained from the T-12 line only. Although the thymus of the transgenic mice was slightly smaller than the littermate mice, both spleen and lymph nodes were comparatively much larger in the transgenic mice. To verify the expression of SMAR1 at mRNA level, total RNA was isolated from thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes of both transgenic and littermate control mice and processed for RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1D). Densitometric analysis demonstrated that compared with the littermate normal, SMAR1 transgenic mice exhibited a 3–5-fold increase in the smar1s transcript in thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (Fig. 1D) indicating a higher expression of SMAR1 in transgenic mice. As a control for equal template concentrations used in these two samples, cDNA from both transgenic and normal littermate were processed for RT-PCR using Thy-1 expression. There was no apparent difference in the expression of Thy-1 between these mice (Fig. 1E). Other tissues from these mice were also checked for SMAR1 expression. Among the other organs checked, higher expression was observed both in kidney and testis (data not shown). SMAR1 Transgenic Mice Exhibit Organomegaly—To observe the phenotypic effect of overexpression of SMAR1 in mice, we analyzed transgenic mice of various age groups. At birth and until three months of age, wild-type and transgenic mice were indistinguishable. The survival of transgenic mice appeared similar to that of their normal counterparts. After 6–8 weeks, the transgenic mice displayed splenomegaly and marked lymphadenopathy but the average body weight remained the same as that of wild type. By 8 weeks, all the lymph nodes isolated from the transgenic mice were 3–5-fold larger than the control mice. In particular, the lymph nodes isolated from the inguinal region of SMAR1 transgenic mice (1 cm) were five times bigger than that of the control (2 mm) (Fig. 2A). Compared with control, the size of the spleen was also increased by 1.5–2.5-fold in transgenic mice (Fig. 2, E and G). There was no appreciable size difference in other organs of transgenic and control mice indicating that overexpression of SMAR1 might be deleterious for the normal development of lymph nodes and spleen. The histological sections of lymph node depicted severe hyperplasia and infiltration of lymphocytes (Fig. 2, B–D). Moreover, in the lymph nodes, the normal distribution of the lymphoid cells within the germinal center was altered. The overall network within the medullar region in transgenic mice was irregular and more compact compared with normal mice, thus exhibiting a distinct loss in normal nodal architecture (Fig. 2, B–D). Interestingly, lymph node sections in transgenic mice exhibited greater numbers of lymphoid cells in the form of round patches. Compared with the littermate control, spleen in transgenic mice also showed high infiltration of lymphocytes, a characteristic of hyperplasia (Fig. 2, F and H). Thus, overexpression of SMAR1 results in architectural alteration in spleen as well as lymph nodes accompanied by their significant enlargement. SMAR1 Overexpression Mildly Perturbs T Cell Development at Early DN Stage—Earlier, we have shown that SMAR1 expression is higher during the DP stage compared with either the DN or SP stage T cells (32Chattopadhyay S. Kaul R. Charest A. Housman D. Chen J. Genomics. 2000; 68: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We reasoned that overexpression of SMAR1 in transgenic mice may further elucidate its role in the T cell development. To assess the development of T cells in the thymus of transgenic mice, thymocytes were stained for the surface expression of CD4/CD8 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Compared with the littermate control, in SMAR1 transgenic mice the percentage of cells in the DP (CD4+CD8+) compartment remained unchanged (∼73%) (Fig. 3, A–C). There was no significant difference in the population of T cells expressing CD4+ SP or CD8+ SP cells in transgenic mice (Fig. 3, A–C). Interestingly, in transgenic mice both CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive T cells were reduced by 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, D and E). Thus, overexpression of SMAR1 perturbed maturation of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in thymus. Since V(D)J recombination of TCRβ locus occurs in the DN subset of thymocyte population (CD4-CD8-CD44-CD25+) (12Brown M.L. Franco D. Burkle A. Chang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4532-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the expression profile of CD44 and CD25 was studied. The DN cells were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” CD44 versus CD25 FACS profiles of purified DN thymocytes revealed about a 2-fold increase in the population of CD44+CD25+cells in SMAR1 transgenic mice compared with the control mice (Fig. 3, F–H). Accumulation of such a significant population of CD44+CD25+ cells in the thymus suggests that overexpression of SMAR1 moderately perturbs the T cell development at an early DN stage. SMAR1 Affects T Cell Maturation—Because SMAR1 transgenic mice exhibit a defect in the T cell development at an early DN stage, it is possible that its overexpression may affect the maturation of T cells. The expression of early T cell markers was checked by FACS analysis of T cells isolated from lymph nodes of either transgenic or littermate control mice. Interestingly, there is a significant increase in the frequency of T cells expressing CD4+CD62L+ (7.3-fold) (Fig. 4, A–C), CD4+CD45RB+ (3.4-fold) (Fig. 4, D–F), and CD4+CD44+ (2.5-fold) markers (Fig. 4, G–I). An equivalent increase in the population of CD4+CD45RB- and CD4+C"
https://openalex.org/W2060438759,"EmrE is a small multidrug transporter in Escherichia coli that extrudes various positively charged drugs across the plasma membrane in exchange with protons, thereby rendering cells resistant to these compounds. Biochemical experiments indicate that the basic functional unit of EmrE is a dimer where the common binding site for protons and substrate is formed by the interaction of an essential charged residue (Glu-14) from both EmrE monomers. Carbodiimide modification of EmrE has been studied using functional assays, and the evidence suggests that Glu-14 is the target of the reaction. Here we exploited electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to directly monitor the reaction with each monomer rather than following inactivation of the functional unit. A cyanogen bromide peptide containing Glu-14 allows the extent of modification by the carboxyl-specific modification reagent diisopropylcarbodiimide (DiPC) to be monitored and reveals that peptide 2NPYIYLGGAILAEVIGTTLM21 is ∼80% modified in a time-dependent fashion, indicating that each Glu-14 residue in the oligomer is accessible to DiPC. Furthermore, preincubation with tetraphenylphosphonium reduces the reaction of Glu-14 with DiPC by up to 80%. Taken together with other biochemical data, the findings support a “time sharing” mechanism in which both Glu-14 residues in a dimer are involved in tetraphenylphosphonium and H+ binding.

It is a small (110-residue) multidrug transporter that extrudes various positively charged drugs in exchange for protons, thus rendering bacteria resistant to these drugs (Fig. 1, A and B) (1Yerushalmi H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical evidence suggests that the basic EmrE oligomer is a dimer (7Elbaz Y. Steiner-Mordoch S. Danieli T.

Biol. 2004; 340: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). EmrE has only one membrane-embedded charged residue, Glu-14, which is conserved in more than 100 homologous proteins (5Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Acidic side chains embedded in the membrane have been shown to be important for activity in various ion-coupled transporters (for a review, see Ref. 11Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In some cases, these acidic side chains are involved in substrate recognition and binding; in others, they comprise part of the coupling ion translocation pathway. EmrE is unique in that the same acidic side chain (the carboxyl group of Glu-14) is involved in recognition of both substrate and the coupling ion. Furthermore, because replacement of the two other acidic side chains in EmrE (E25C/D84C) 2Site-directed mutants are designated as follows: the one-letter amino acid code is used followed by a number indicating the position of the residue, followed by a letter denoting the replacement at that position.2Site-directed mutants are designated as follows: the one-letter amino acid code is used followed by a number indicating the position of the residue, followed by a letter denoting the replacement at that position. does not detrimentally effect the activity of the protein, it is concluded that the only carboxyl group required for catalysis is that of Glu-14 (12Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Within the small multidrug resistance family of transporters, a comparative analysis reveals that the face of transmembrane domain 1 containing Glu-14 is conserved, displaying a helical periodicity. Site-directed mutagenesis of this trans-membrane domain 1 face identifies a cluster of five amino acids that play a role in substrate and H+ recognition and/or trans-location, with substitutions at most positions yielding either inactive mutants or mutants with modified affinity to substrates (14Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, a homologue of EmrE from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum (Hsmr) is built of over 40% valine and alanine residues and remains relatively unaltered on the face containing Glu-14. However, Val and Ala residues are clustered on the face opposite Glu-14 in domains that do not seem important for activity (15Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12000-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the hydrophobic carbodiimides (carboxyl-specific modification reagents) dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DiPC) inhibit the binding and transport of substrates by EmrE (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas dimethylaminopropyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide (EDAC), a hydro-philic carbodiimide, does not. Moreover, because dicyclohexylcarbodiimide also inactivated an EmrE mutant containing only a single carboxyl residue at position 14, it was inferred that Glu-14 is covalently modified by the carbodiimide (12Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, no information was available as to the number of Glu-14 residues reacting in the functional unit. In the present study, by exploiting the ability of reverse phase (RP)-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in conjunction with ESI-MS to resolve complex mixtures (16Weinglass A.B. Whitelegge J.P. Kaback H.R. Curr. Opin. Drug. Discov. Dev. 2004; 7: 589-599PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weinglass A. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it was directly demonstrated that Glu-14 is modified by DiPC. Moreover, tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) reduces modification of Glu-14 by ∼80%, indicating that both Glu-14 residues in the functional unit are close enough to the binding site that TPP+ prevents their modification or that they might be equivalently protected in an allosteric manner by TPP+. These observations are not consistent with a recent mechanistic model based on three-dimensional crystals diffracting to 3.8 Å (19Ma C. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this model, the functional unit of EmrE is a dimer of structural heterodimers. However, within each heterodimer the two Glu-14s are in structurally distinct positions leading to functionally distinct roles in proton and substrate translocation. The observations presented here are more consistent with a “time-sharing” model where the Glu-14 residues in both monomers are in a similar environment, have similar reactivity to carbodiimides, and are both involved in substrate and proton recognition. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli TA15 (20Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was used for EmrE expression. Cells were transformed with plasmid pGP1–2, which encodes for the regulated expression of T7 polymerase under the inducible control of the λPL promoter (21Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). The plasmids used for EmrE gene expression are pT7–7 (21Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) derivatives with the hexahistidine tag using a Myc epitope as linker (4Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Throughout this report, for simplicity, Mycand His-tagged protein is named EmrE. E25C, D84C, and E25C/D84CEmrE (SC-EmrE, single carboxyl construct) mutants were previously characterized (12Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Overexpression and Purification of EmrE—E. coli TA15 cells that bear plasmids pGP1–2 and pT7–7 containing His-tagged EmrE constructs were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium A supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml thiamine, 0.5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When the culture reached A600 = 1, the temperature was elevated rapidly to 42 °C to allow for T7 polymerase expression for 15 min and then was decreased to 30 °C. Two hours later the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose before storage at –70 °C. For membrane preparation, cells were resuspended in the same buffer containing 2.5 mm MgSO4,1mm dithiothreitol, 15 μg/ml DNaseI, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 ml of buffer/g cells). Membranes were prepared by disrupting the cells using a Microfluidics microfluidizer processor (M-110EHi). Nondisrupted cells were discarded by centrifugation (4225 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 240,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was washed and resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (membrane protein concentration ∼20 mg/ml), frozen in liquid air, and stored at –70 °C. Wild type EmrE and the mutants were purified by solubilizing membranes (∼5 mg of protein/ml) in 1% DDM, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 40 min at 25 °C. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 240,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. In the case of single carboxyl-EmrE, β-mercaptoethanol (15 mm) was added throughout purification to prevent cysteine cross-linking. The solubilized protein was loaded on a HiTrap™ chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) mounted on an Akta Explorer (Amer-sham Biosciences) and washed with 0.08% DDM, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5 till A280 of the flowthrough decreased below 0.05. EmrE was eluted with a gradient of up to 300 mm imidazole. Major peak fractions were pooled, and the protein solution was brought to ∼5 mg/ml EmrE (according to A280). The protein stock was aliquoted, frozen in liquid air, and stored at –70 °C. Carbodiimide Labeling and Sample Preparation for Size Exclusion HPLC of Full-length EmrE or RP-HPLC of CNBr Fragments—DiPC and EDAC were freshly prepared as 1 m stocks dissolved in Me2SO and water, respectively. After dialysis of purified protein in 50 mm NaPi (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% DDM, the protein was reacted with DiPC or EDAC at 30 °C for a given time and immediately precipitated with CHCl3/MeOH as described (22Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar). An aliquot (100 μl) of the aqueous protein solution at a concentration of 1–2 mg/ml was diluted 1:3 (v/v) with MeOH and mixed briefly. CHCl3 (100 μl) was added and mixed, yielding a single phase. Phase separation was accomplished by adding water (200 μl) and mixing vigorously. The phases were separated by centrifugation (10000 × g for 2 min), yielding a precipitate at the interface. Although EmrE is soluble in CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v), at the ratio used here it was possible to isolate the precipitate by rapidly removing the bulk of the upper aqueous methanol phase by careful aspiration, followed by tilting of the tube allowing removal of the lower chloroform phase in a similar fashion. For size exclusion HPLC of the full-length protein, the pellet was air dried for 1–2 min with the tube inverted and resuspended in 90% formic acid. For cleavage of the protein, after drying the pellet it was resuspended in a saturated solution of CNBr in 90% formic acid and left for 2 h in the dark. Formic acid was removed in a vacuum centrifuge, and the pellet was left in 0.5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water overnight. The sample was dried again and resuspended in 60% formic acid immediately prior to RP-HPLC. HPLC—For final purification of EmrE after covalent modification with DiPC, HPLC was used prior to ESI-MS in an in-line setup (liquid chromatography/MS). To separate the CNBr peptides generated from EmrE, a polystyrene/divinylbenzene column (PLRP/S, Polymer Labs, 5 μm, 300 Å, 150 mm × 2.1 mm) at 40 °C was used for reverse phase liquid chromatography/MS (23Whitelegge J.P. Jewess P. Pickering M.G. Gerrish C. Camilleri P. Bowyer J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following equilibration in 95% solvent A:5% solvent B for 5 min (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN:isopropanol (1:1)), the percentage of solvent B was increased to 40% over the next 25 min and further to 100% B over the subsequent 120 min at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. All chromatographic separations were performed at 40 °C using a modified ABI 120A dual-syringe pump HPLC equipped with a post-detector (A280) splitter for back pressure regulation. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—ESI-MS was performed using a PerkinElmer Sciex API III triple-quadrupole instrument operating in the positive ion mode as described. The orifice potential was 75 V for full-length EmrE and ramped from 60 to 120 V across the mass range (600 –2300) for CNBr fragments. MS/MS spectrometry fragment ion spectra were obtained by splitting the flow into the API-III during RP-HPLC and collecting peptides of interest for infusion (3 μl/min) into a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca ion trap instrument with a 33-gauge stainless steel needle source at 3.3 kV. The nomenclature used for fragment ions is N-terminal fragments (b type) and C-terminal fragments (y type). ESI-MS of EmrE—Following electrospray ionization, EmrE ions carrying from 7 to 16 positive charges (H+) are readily detected (Fig. 1C). Molecular mass reconstruction of wild type EmrE with a carboxyl-terminal Myc- and His6 tag reveals that the EmrE gene product is homogeneous and that the computed mass (15,192 Da) matches closely that calculated from the DNA sequence (Fig. 1D, 15,192 Da). However, because of the harsh resolubilization regimen (90% formic acid), there is also a formylation adduct (15,219 Da). Identification of the Glu-14-containing CNBr Fragment by ESI-MS/MS—Previous studies indicate that Glu-14 is covalently modified by hydrophobic carbodiimides leading to inactivation of EmrE (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because wild type EmrE has 10 carboxyl group-containing side chains (7 of them in the Myc-His tag), to quantify the extent of carbodiimide modification of Glu-14 EmrE was cleaved with CNBr (Fig. 2A). The resultant peptides (Fig. 2A) were resolved by RP-HPLC in-line with ESI-MS as described under “Materials and Methods,” revealing a peptide with a measured monoisotopic mass ([M+H]+) of 2061 Da, which is in close agreement with that calculated (2061.l Da). Notably, most of the observed ion current existed in a doubly charged state at m/z 1031.9. Collisionally activated dissociation of the doubly charged parent ion revealed fragment ions consistent with the sequence 2NPYIYLGGAILAE-VIGTTLM21 (Fig. 2B). TPP+Protectable Modification of Glu-14 by DiPC—The reaction of a carbodiimide with a carboxyl group leads to the formation of a protonated O-acylisourea that rearranges to form a stable N-acylisourea with no further change in mass (Refs. 24Khorana H.G. Chem. Rev. 1953; 53: 145-166Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 25Hoare D.G. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2447-2453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 3A). Following reaction of EmrE with DiPC, RP-HPLC-ESI-MS of CNBr fragments resolved by RPHPLC revealed a doubly charged parent ion at m/z 1094.9 corresponding to a molecule of molecular mass 2187.8 Da with a measured 126.7 Da mass increase (Fig. 3B, compare I and II). Collision-activated dissociation of the doubly charged parent ion at m/z 1094.9 revealed fragment ions consistent with the sequence 2NPYIYLGGAILAEVIGTTLM21 modified at position 14 by DiPC (data not shown). Notably, reaction of EmrE with a 10-fold higher concentration of the hydrophilic carbodiimide EDAC leads to only ∼8% modification of Glu-14 over an extended time period (Fig. 4A, II, 120 min), demonstrating once again that hydrophobicity of the reagent governs access to Glu-14.Fig. 4Quantitative analysis of Glu-14 modification. A, time course of 2NPYIYLGGAILAEVIGTTLM21 modification by DiPC. Purified EmrE (∼40 μm) in DDM at pH 6.5 was incubated with the shown concentrations of DiPC (I) or EDAC (II) at 30 °C for varying amounts of time, leading to a mass shift of 126 or 155 atomic mass units, respectively. The total ion current from peptide 2NPYIYLGGAILAEVIGTTLM21 modified by DiPC divided by the total ion current from unmodified and modified 2NPYIYLGGAILAEVIGTTLM21 was used to calculate the percentage modification of Glu-14. No measurable difference in the ionization efficiency of the unmodified and modified peptides was detected. Each point represents the average of two independent experiments. Maximum peak height in the absence of modification was ∼4 × 105 counts. B, concentration dependence of TPP+ effect on DiPC modification of Glu-14. Purified EmrE (∼40 μm) in DDM at pH 6.5 was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), 10 mm DiPC, or 10 mm DiPC in the presence of TPP+ (0.1 or 1 mm). The total ion current from peptide 2NPYIYLGGAILAEVIGTTLM21 modified by DiPC divided by the total ion current from unmodified and modified 2NPYIYLGGAILAEVIGTTLM21 was used to calculate the percentage modification of Glu-14. No measurable difference in the ionization efficiency of the unmodified and modified peptides was detected. Each point represents the average of two independent experiments. Maximum peak height in the absence of modification was ∼4 × 105 counts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously published results (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) demonstrate that substrates protect EmrE from inhibition by hydrophobic carbodiimides, and the results presented here by RP-HPLC in-line with ESI-MS reveal that TPP+ protects EmrE by reducing the amount of modification of Glu-14 by DiPC (Fig. 3B, compare II and III). At pH 6.5, DiPC reacts in a concentration-dependent manner with the carboxyl group of Glu-14 and the reaction terminates at ∼80% modification, most probably because of the instability of carbodiimides in aqueous solution (Fig. 4A, I). This information identified the linear range of DiPC modification and served as the foundation of a quantitative experiment using different concentrations of TPP+. Although the experimental setup did not allow the use of EmrE concentrations lower that 40 μm, thus preventing us from studying the concentration dependence of TPP+ protection against DiPC modification at low concentrations, higher concentrations of TPP+ clearly reduce the extent of DiPC modification by ∼80% (Fig. 4B). Previously, carbodiimide modification of EmrE has been studied using functional assays monitoring EmrE inactivation. Two lines of evidence suggest that Glu-14 is the target of this carbodiimide-mediated inactivation: (i) EmrE is inactivated by hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, carbodiimides; (ii) an EmrE mutant possessing a single carboxyl at position 14 is inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in a similar manner to wild type. A remarkable aspect of the inhibition is that it can be virtually completely prevented by substrates of EmrE. Now, by exploiting ESI-MS, it is possible to monitor the reaction of carbodiimide with each EmrE monomer directly rather than following inactivation of the functional unit. Practically all (∼80%) of the detergent-solubilized EmrE is covalently modified by the hydrophobic carbodiimide DiPC. CNBr cleavage of EmrE reveals that DiPC reacts extensively with the peptide containing Glu-14, leading to the expected change in mass because of the formation of an N-acylurea. In contrast, as expected from functional studies (13Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the hydro-philic carbodiimide EDAC fails to react significantly at concentrations up to 10-fold higher (20 mm). Because the carbodiimide moiety reacts with the protonated form of a carboxyl group, it is concluded that all Glu-14 residues in the EmrE functional unit are accessible to DiPC, inaccessible to EDAC, and predominantly protonated at pH 6.5. These findings agree with previous studies demonstrating that Glu-14 is buried with an anomalously high pKa of ∼8.5 (26Soskine M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9951-9955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that Glu-14 is accessible to relatively large bulky hydrophobic reagents (e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DiPC), but inaccessible to similarly sized hydrophilic reagents (e.g. EDAC), strengthens the hypothesis that Glu-14 is located inside a large hydrophobic drug binding pocket. Interestingly, EmrE mutants with either (E25C or D84C) or both (single carboxyl-EmrE) of the carboxyl residues located in the loops removed undergo DiPC modification in a fashion very similar to the wild type EmrE, supporting the idea that the Glu-14 carboxyl is not networked with other acidic residues (data not shown). Structural evidence from two-dimensional crystals led to the proposal that the minimal functional unit of EmrE was likely to be a dimer (27Tate C. Kunji E. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by determination of the three-dimensional structure of EmrE with TPP+ bound at 7.5 Å resolution by electron cryomicroscopy of two-dimensional crystals (9Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Baldwin J.M. Schuldiner S. Tate C.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6175-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The minimal structural unit is an asymmetric homodimer composed of 8 transmembrane α-helices, i.e. 4 helices from each monomer, with density for TPP+ in a binding chamber formed from 6 of the 8 α-helices, confirming the suggestion that TPP+ binds near the center of the dimer (9Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Baldwin J.M. Schuldiner S. Tate C.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6175-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, these findings do not rule out the existence of higher order oligomers. In fact, co-expression of two plasmids in a cell-free system allowed demonstration of functional complementation, and pulldown experiments suggested that the basic functional unit is the dimer (7Elbaz Y. Steiner-Mordoch S. Danieli T. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas additional weak interactions between dimers detected using cross-linking implies the existence of a dimer of dimers (7Elbaz Y. Steiner-Mordoch S. Danieli T. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on crystals of EmrE that diffract to 3.8 Å, an atomic model was recently proposed by Ma and Chang (19Ma C. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this model, the structure of EmrE is a tetramer composed of two conformational heterodimers related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis perpendicular to the membrane surface. In each conformational heterodimer, the Glu-14 residues are in a different environment, one solvent exposed while the other lies in a putatively hydrophobic environment. A transport mechanism is suggested in which the functional unit is a tetramer formed by two heterodimers. Within each heterodimer, one Glu-14 takes part in drug binding while the other is responsible for proton translocation resulting in coupling of the drug and proton fluxes (Fig. 5, Model I). Critically, such a model indicates that there are two equally sized subpopulations of Glu-14 carboxyls, each residing in a significantly different environment, most likely with different pKa and accessibility to DiPC, EDAC, TPP+. However, the results of this study indicated that ∼80% of Glu-14 are modified by DiPC and, similarly, TPP+ protects against ∼80% of this modification, suggesting that the Glu-14 residues in the functional unit of EmrE are functionally equivalent, playing a direct role in substrate binding. Finally, previous studies demonstrate that practically all (>80%) the EmrE monomers release a proton from the Glu-14 carboxyl upon substrate binding (26Soskine M. Adam Y. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9951-9955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), implying that both Glu-14s in the EmrE dimer are involved in proton binding and release. Furthermore, an proton-substrate antiport studied in proteoliposomes was found to be electroneutral for doubly charged substrates and electrogenic for singly charged substrates (28Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48787-48793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These findings led to the conclusion that two protons are exchanged with one substrate molecule in each transport cycle. Taken together, the results support a model (Fig. 5, Model II) where the basic functional unit is a dimer with both monomers participating in a single binding site shared by protons and substrate."

T cell receptor (TCR)-induced activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) depends on three features of SLP-76: the N-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites, the Gads-binding site, and an intervening sequence, denoted the P-I region, which binds to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 (SH3PLC) via a low affinity interaction. Despite extensive research, the mechanism whereby SLP-76 regulates PLC-γ1 remains uncertain. In this study, we uncover and explore an apparent paradox: whereas the P-I region as a whole is essential for TCR-induced activation of PLC-γ1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), no particular part of this region is absolutely required. To better understand the contribution of the P-I region to PLC-γ1 activation, we mapped the PLC-γ1-binding site within the region, and created a SLP-76 mutant that fails to bind SH3PLC, but is fully functional, mediating TCR-induced phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 at tyrosine 783, calcium flux, and nuclear factor of activated T cells activation. Unexpectedly, full functionality of this mutant was maintained even under less than optimal stimulation conditions, such as a low concentration of the anti-TCR antibody. Another SLP-76 mutant, in which the P-I region was scrambled to abolish any sequence-dependent protein-binding motifs, also retained significant functionality. Our results demonstrate that SLP-76 need not interact with SH3PLC to activate PLC-γ1, and further suggest that the P-I region of SLP-76 serves a structural role that is sequence-independent and is not directly related to protein-protein interactions.

PLC-γ1 catalyzes the formation of 2 second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which, respectively, trigger calcium flux and contribute to protein kinase C and Ras activation (1Carpenter G.

The coordinated activation of calcium- and Ras-dependent signaling pathways leads to the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a regulator of interleukin-2 transcription (3Woodrow M.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Activation of PLC-γ is tightly regulated by at least three hematopoietic-specific adaptor proteins: LAT, Gads, and SLP-76 (5Yablonski D. Weiss A. Adv.

Upon TCR stimulation, the membrane-anchored adaptor protein, LAT, is heavily tyrosine phosphorylated, and associates with the N-terminal SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 (7Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J.

This interaction recruits PLC-γ1 to the membrane where it interacts with upstream activators and with the inositol phospholipids that are its substrate (10Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E.

Recruitment of PLC-γ1 to the membrane is accompanied by its phosphorylation at tyrosines 771, 783, and 1254 (12Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G.

A. 1991; 88: 5453-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Whereas PLC-γ1 binds directly to LAT, SLP-76 is recruited to LAT by the Grb-2-family adaptor protein, Gads (14Liu S.K. Fang N.

Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Sugamura K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the absence of SLP-76, PLC-γ1 is still recruited to LAT, but is not efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated or detectably activated, indicating that SLP-76-dependent regulatory events are required to activate PLC-γ1, within the LAT-nucleated complex (16Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Such SLP-76-dependent activation of PLC-γ1 is common to a number of signaling pathways initiated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors, including the TCR, Fcϵ receptor, glycoprotein VI collagen receptor, and the Fcγ receptor (16Yablonski D.

SLP-76 consists of three domains capable of mediating intermolecular interactions: an N-terminal acidic domain containing three tyrosine phosphorylation sites, a central proline-rich region, and a C-terminal SH2 domain (21Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 22Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar). Through these domains, SLP-76 can interact with a large number of signaling proteins (5Yablonski D. Weiss A. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 93-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The functional importance of each of the domains has been explored by reconstituting SLP-76-deficient mice, bone marrow-derived mast cells, or the SLP-76-deficient T cell line, J14, with various mutant alleles of SLP-76 (23Myung P.S.

Individual mutation of each domain results in a somewhat different phenotype, suggesting that SLP-76 may exert more than one distinct signaling function. In all cases where a strictly PLC-γ-dependent outcome, such as calcium flux, was measured, the studies support the conclusion that the N-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites and Gads-binding site of SLP-76 make a significant contribution to the activation of PLC-γ (23Myung P.S.

By contrast, the SH2 domain is largely dispensable for PLC-γ activation (23Myung P.S. Derimanov G.S. Jordan M.S. Punt J.A. Liu Q.-H. Judd B.A. Meyers E.E. Sigmund C.D. Freedman B.D. Koretzky G.A.

A. 2002; 99: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to the above, a 67-amino acid stretch of SLP-76, known as the P-I region, is required for TCR-induced activation of PLC-γ1 and NFAT (25Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Located between the N-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites and the Gads-binding site of SLP-76, the proline-rich, P-I region can bind to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 (SH3PLC) (25Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the notion that an interaction between SH3PLC and the P-I region of SLP-76 may contribute to the activation of PLC-γ1. However, other interpretations are possible. For example, the P-I region may mediate an essential interaction with another signaling protein that participates in the regulation of PLC-γ1 (27Sanzenbacher R. Kabelitz D. Janssen O. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3143-3152PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bunnell S.C. Diehn M. Yaffe M.B. Findell P.R. Cantley L.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2219-2230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); alternatively, the P-I region may serve an essential structural role required to support the proper function of other regions of SLP-76. In the present study, we have taken a closer look at the P-I region of SLP-76, with the goal of distinguishing between the above hypotheses. Although we have reproduced the previously reported results concerning the P-I deletion, a detailed structure-function analysis of this region suggests that there are no essential protein-protein interactions mediated by the P-I region of SLP-76. Rather, this region appears to serve a sequence-independent function, and may act as a spacer, or hinge region that facilitates the active conformation of other functional regions of SLP-76. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibody C305 was used for anti-TCR stimulations (29Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar).

Phospho-specific anti-PLC-γ1 (pY783) and phospho-specific anti-SLP-76 (pY145) were from BIOSOURCE. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against full-length, recombinant human SLP-76, using the Sigma custom antiserum service. Plasmids—All human SLP-76 alleles were FLAG-tagged at the N terminus and were subcloned into pEFBos (30Mizushima S. Nagata S.

A modification of the overlapping PCR technique was used to create SLP-76-scrambled.

J14 cells were stably transfected by electroporation with SLP-76ΔP-Ib++, followed by cloning of transfected cells by limiting dilution in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Three clones expressing different levels of SLP-76ΔP-Ib++ and similar levels of surface TCR were chosen for further analysis. Transient transfections were performed by electroporation using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories), at a setting of 234 V and 1000 microfarads, using a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad). GST Fusion Protein—All glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria, using the pGEX-2TK bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences), purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) by standard procedures (32Sambrook J.

PCR was used to amplify different fragments of SLP-76 prior to subcloning into pGEX-2TK (see Fig. 4A for details). Constructs encoding GST-SH3Lck and GST-SH3Gads(C-terminal) were generously provided by Ottmar Janssen (University Hospital Kiel, Kiel, Germany). The construct encoding GST-SH3PLCγ1 was described previously (25Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline), preheated to 37 °C for 10 min, stimulated or mock stimulated as indicated, collected, and lysed at 108 cells/ml in cold lysis buffer containing 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After 20 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were used directly for immunoprecipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting, performed using standard procedures. Luciferase Assay—Cells were transiently cotransfected with 15 μg of an NFAT luciferase reporter plasmid along with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends. 16-20 h later cells were aliquoted into a 96-well cell culture dish at 2 × 105 cells/well and stimulated for 6 h at 37 °C, with the stimuli indicated in the figure legends. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (33Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, the NFAT luciferase activity obtained upon receptor stimulation was normalized to the activity obtained upon treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 μm). Intracellular Calcium—Cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator dye Indo-1 (Molecular Probes), washed, and resuspended in calcium buffer, consisting of 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, and 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A Victor2 V fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for kinetic measurement of fluorescence at 37 °C, with excitation at 355 nm and emission measured at 405 and 486 nm. An automatic injector was used to stimulate cells with anti-TCR (C305) followed by stimulation with 1 mm thapsigargin (Sigma), at the time points indicated in the figure. Calcium concentration was calculated based upon the ratio of F405/F486 as described (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Functional Importance of the P-I Region of SLP-76 Is Not Attributable to Any Particular Part of the Region—Previous studies have identified a functionally important segment, denoted the P-I region and encompassing residues 157-223 of SLP-76, that binds to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 and is required for TCR-mediated activation of PLC-γ1 (25Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The P-I region consists of 67 amino acids, 19 of which are proline. To identify functional motifs within this region, three new SLP-76 deletion mutants (ΔP-Ia, ΔP-Ib, and ΔP-Ic), each lacking one-third of the P-I region (Fig. 1A), were transiently transfected into the SLP-76-deficient cell line, J14, and TCR-induced activation of the NFAT transcription factor was measured (Fig. 1B). All SLP-76 alleles were expressed at levels similar to or higher than the wild-type protein with the exception of the ΔP-Ic mutant, which was consistently expressed at lower levels (data not shown). Unexpectedly, each of the mutants bearing these smaller deletions retained significant activity, reflected in 10-40-fold activation of the NFAT-luciferase reporter, upon TCR stimulation. Whereas none of the mutants was as active as wild-type SLP-76, none showed the striking lack of activity seen in the P-I deletion mutant. SLP-76 Can Mediate Activation of NFAT, in the Absence of a Binding Site for SH3PLC—The above experiments were quite puzzling. Although deletion of the entire P-I region abrogates SLP-76 function, no particular part of the P-I region is absolutely required for SLP-76 function. We therefore created a fourth mutant, denoted ΔP-Ib++, in which a deletion of residues 177-212 of SLP-76 results in the removal of 15 of the 19 proline residues of the P-I region (Fig. 1A). When transiently transfected into J14 cells, ΔP-Ib++, resembled ΔP-Ia, ΔP-Ib, and ΔP-Ic, in that it retained a significant ability to mediate TCR-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 1B). The ΔP-Ib++ mutant was stably transfected into J14 cells, and three clones that expressed different levels of SLP-76ΔP-Ib++ (Fig. 2A, lower panel) but approximately equivalent levels of surface TCR (data not shown) were tested for TCR-induced activation of NFAT. Strikingly, SLP-76ΔP-Ib++-reconstituted J14 cells exhibited NFAT activation to the same extent as wild-type SLP-76-reconstituted J14 cells (Fig. 2A). This result was observed in all three clones, including two that expressed a lower level of SLP-76 than the wild-type-reconstituted cells. Clone 4, which most closely matched the wild-type-reconstituted cells in the level of SLP-76 expression, was used in all subsequent experiments. Despite clear evidence that the ΔP-Ib++-reconstituted cells have not regained expression of wild-type SLP-76 (Fig. 2B), the response of SLP-76ΔP-Ib++-reconstituted J14 was similar to wild-type SLP-76-reconstituted J14 cells over a wide range of doses of the stimulatory anti-TCR antibody (Fig. 2C). Whereas the ΔP-Ib++ mutant appeared fully functional, the slightly larger deletion found in the ΔP-I mutant renders SLP-76 completely non-functional. To explore the biochemical basis for this difference, we tested the major known biochemical attributes of SLP-76. Both mutants were inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation. No differences were noted in the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of these mutants, relative to wild-type SLP-76, whether we looked at their overall tyrosine phosphorylation (using 4G10) or site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation (using an antiserum specific to phospho-Tyr145 of SLP-76) (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, both mutants bound constitutively to Gads, as does wild-type SLP-76 (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the ability of Gads to recruit SLP-76 into the LAT-nucleated signaling complex (25Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), both the ΔP-I and the ΔP-Ib++ mutants were observed in anti-PLC-γ1 immune complexes, when isolated from TCR-stimulated cells (data not shown). By contrast, the sensitivity of the co-immunoprecipitation assay did not permit detection of basal interactions between PLC-γ1 and SLP-76 in unstimulated cells. To test the potential for direct, SH3-mediated interactions, we therefore turned to GST pull-down experiments, which revealed that ΔP-Ib++ closely resembled the ΔP-I mutant in its binding characteristics to various SH3 domains. Like SLP-76ΔP-I, SLP-76ΔP-Ib++ bound to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Gads, and to the Lck SH3 domain, but did not bind to the PLC-γ1 SH3 domain (Fig. 3B). Thus, we have generated two SLP-76 mutants, which are similar in their biochemical characteristics, but exhibit a remarkable difference in functionality. Mapping the PLC-γ1 Binding Site within the P-I Region of SLP-76 —To localize the PLC-γ1 binding site within the P-I region of SLP-76, the GST fusion constructs shown in Fig. 4A were tested for their ability to bind PLC-γ1 (Fig. 4B). Whereas GST fused to the entire P-I region (residues 157-223) interacted with PLC-γ1, preliminary mapping showed that fragments including the N-terminal (residues 150-176) or C-terminal (residues 194-223) portion of the P-I domain, did not bind PLC-γ1, despite an equivalent amount of the GST fusion protein (Fig. 4B). All fragments including residues 170-196 of SLP-76 bound PLC-γ1; however, a fragment containing residues 170-191 did not. We conclude that SH3PLC binds to the P-I domain of SLP-76, via a single binding site, located at the C-terminal end of fragment 170-196 of SLP-76. Indeed, residues 186-197 of SLP-76, PPVPPQRPMAAL, closely resemble the canonical PLC-γ1 SH3 binding site, described by Sparks et al. (PPVPPRPXXTL) (35Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the PLC-γ1-binding site identified in these experiments is deleted in the ΔP-Ib++ mutant (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this finding, the ΔP-Ib++ mutant fails to bind to the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 3B), nonetheless, this mutant remains functional (Fig. 2). Taken together the above results demonstrate that interaction of the PLC-γ1 SH3 domain with SLP-76 is not required to mediate TCR-induced NFAT activation. Activation of PLC-γ1 by the ΔP-Ib++Mutant of SLP-76 —Robust activation of NFAT by a SLP-76 mutant that fails to bind PLC-γ1 was an unexpected finding. To verify that SLP-76ΔP-Ib++-mediated NFAT activation is indeed associated with activation of PLC-γ1; we assessed the ability of the mutant to mediate TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. Because overall tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 does not always correlate well with activation (24Kettner A. Pivniouk V. Kumar L. Herve F. Lee J.-S. Mulligan R. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell.

Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), using phosphospecific antibodies. Over a range of stimulation times, TCR-induced Tyr783 phosphorylation was greatly reduced in J14 cells or SLP-76ΔP-I-reconstituted J14 cells, but was clearly detected in wild-type- or SLP-76ΔP-Ib++-reconstituted cells (Fig. 5A). The effect of SLP-76 on Tyr783 phosphorylation was very reproducible, and, in general, correlated well with the activity of these and other SLP-76 mutants (data not shown). Consistent with this result, TCR-induced calcium flux was of similar magnitude in SLP-76ΔP-Ib++-reconstituted J14 cells as compared with wild-type-reconstituted cells (Fig. 5B). By contrast, J14 cells or SLP-76ΔP-I-reconstituted J14 cells exhibited very low TCR-induced calcium flux. Thus, the ΔP-Ib++ mutant of SLP-76 mediates a level of activation of PLC-γ1 that is sufficient for normal, TCR-induced calcium flux. To test whether the lack of PTEN in Jurkat cells (31Shan X. Czar M.J. Bunnell S.C. Liu P. Liu Y. Schwartzberg P.L. Wange R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6945-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) is responsible for the unexpected activity of the ΔP-Ib++ mutant, we tested the functionality of the ΔP-Ib++-reconstituted cells following transient transfection with PTEN. Even upon expression of PTEN, wild-type and ΔP-Ib++-reconstituted cells exhibited similar TCR-induced NFAT activation (data not shown). Taken together, the above findings are inconsistent with the notion that SLP-76 must bind to PLC-γ1 to activate it. We conclude that the ability of the P-I region of SLP-76 to bind SH3PLC does not underlie the"
https://openalex.org/W1993220763,"All members of the Src family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases are phosphorylated and subsequently down-regulated by the C-terminal Src kinase, Csk. Although the recognition of Src protein substrates is essential for a diverse set of signaling events linked to cellular growth and differentiation, the factors controlling this critical protein-protein interaction are not well known. To understand how Csk recognizes Src, the chemical/physical events that modulate apparent substrate affinity and turnover were investigated. Src is phosphorylated in a biphasic manner in rapid quench flow experiments, suggesting that the phosphoryl transfer step is fast and highly favorable and does not limit overall turnover. As opposed to other kinase-substrate pairs, turnover is not limited by the physical release of ADP based on stopped-flow fluorescence and catalytic trapping experiments, suggesting that other steps control net phosphorylation. The Kd for Src is considerably larger than the Km based on single turnover kinetic and equilibrium sedimentation experiments. Taken together, the data are consistent with a mechanism whereby Csk achieves a low Km for the substrate Src, not by stabilizing protein-protein interactions but rather by facilitating a fast phosphoryl transfer step. In this manner, the phosphoryl transfer step functions as a chemical clamp facilitating substrate recognition."

Many studies have sought to elucidate structure-function relationships involved in SK-initiated Pg activation. As revealed by the crystal structure of SK bound to the catalytic domain of Pm (micro-Pm), SK consists of three homologous, independently folded domains (α-(1–146), β-(147–290), and γ-(291–414)) connected by flexible linking segments (17Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In solution, free SK is highly flexible, with the three domains able to assume many different conformations due to the linking sequences (18Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Gast K. Gerlach D. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Zirwer D. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 20: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SK assumes a stable, highly structured configuration on binding to micro-Pm, in which the domains surround the catalytic site (17Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), implying domain arrangement on binding. Several studies now indicate that the structural basis for conformational activation of Pg is insertion of the N-terminal Ile1 residue of SK into the N-terminal binding cleft of Pg, forming the critical salt bridge with Asp194 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) that triggers the activating conformational change (19Boxrud P.D.

Because of deletion of SK-(1–59), the mutant does not conformationally activate Pg and requires Pm to proteolytically activate Pg. Pm in the presence of SK-(60–414) or point mutants in SK-(1–59) has also been shown to be more susceptible to inhibition by antiplasmin compared with SK·Pm (25Sazonova I.Y. Robinson B.R.

Further studies of the fibrinolytic activity of SK-(60–414) showed that it was greater than SK at high but not low SK concentrations because of the relatively higher activity of native SK in activating Pg in plasma, resulting in increased fibrinolysis by depletion of fibrinogen and Pg (33Mundada L.V.

The mechanisms underlying the functions of the SK α-domain and the behavior of SK-(60–414) are not understood clearly. The contribution of the α-domain to the affinity of SK for Pg and Pm has not been characterized quantitatively. In studies with active-site fluorescein-labeled [Glu]Pg, [Lys]Pg, and [Lys]Pm analogs, SK binds weakly to [Glu]Pg, 13–16-fold tighter to [Lys]Pg, and 3300-fold tighter to [Lys]Pm (3Boxrud P.D.

[Glu]Pg binding is LBS-independent, whereas the affinities of SK for [Lys]Pg and [Lys]Pm are decreased 13–30-fold by saturating concentrations of the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) (3Boxrud P.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14579-14589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The role of the α-domain in the intrinsic differences in affinity and the differential effects of 6-AHA is unknown. The present studies employing the fluorescein-labeled Pg and Pm analogs were undertaken to address the role of LBS-independent and -dependent interactions of the α-domain in the affinity for Pg and Pm species, and to provide information necessary to interpret more clearly the functions of the α-domain in Pg activation. The results demonstrate a major role for the α-domain in LBS-independent interactions with all Pg and Pm species and no evidence for direct participation of this domain in kringle-mediated LBS interactions. Thermodynamic analysis of the interactions of the SK α-domain truncation mutants, SK-(55–414), SK-(70–414), and the complete domain deletion mutant, SK-(152–414) demonstrates that loss of binding free energy from LBS-independent interactions of the α-domain is counteracted by expression of an enhanced contribution from LBS-dependent βγ-domain interactions or free energy coupling between LBS-independent and -dependent binding of the βγ-domain. The results demonstrate the interdependence of the interactions of the individual α-, β- and γ-domains of intact SK and the role of coupling of LBS-independent and -dependent interactions in determining the structure of SK bound in the SK·Pg* and SK·Pm complexes. In keeping with the flexibility between SK domains, deletion of the α-domain results in a different bound conformation of the βγ-domains. The results support the conclusion that loss of LBS-independent interactions mediated by the α-domain with the catalytic domain of Pg and Pm results in the βγ-fragment binding in a conformation that more effectively interacts with LBS of Pg and Pm kringles. The redistribution of LBS-independent and -dependent contributions to affinity and the resulting differences between the structures of SKαβγ·Pg*/Pm and SKβγ·Pg/Pm complexes provide new insight into the complex relationship between SK structure and function in Pg activation.

Moreover, mutations in Fras1/FRAS1 have been associated with the mouse blebbed phenotype and the human rare genetic disorder Fraser syndrome, respectively. Here we report the mapping of Fras1 within the extracellular space and evaluate the effects of Fras1 deficiency on lung development in the mouse. Expression of Fras1 was detected in the mesothelial cells of the visceral pleura and in the conducting airway epithelia. Immunogold histochemistry identified Fras1 as a component of the extracellular matrix localized below the lamina densa of epithelial basement membranes in the embryonic lung. Embryos homozygous for a targeted mutation of Fras1 exhibited fused pulmonary lobes resulting from incomplete separation during development as well as a profound disarrangement of blood capillaries in the terminal air sacs. We demonstrate that loss of Fras1 causes alterations in the molecular composition of basement membranes, concomitant with local disruptions of epithelial-endothelial contacts and extravasation of erythrocytes into the embryonic respiratory lumen. Thus, our findings identify Fras1 as an important structural component of the sub-lamina densa of basement membranes required for lobar septation and the organization of blood capillaries in the peripheral lung.

Thus, our findings identify Fras1 as an important structural component of the sub-lamina densa of basement membranes required for lobar septation and the organization of blood capillaries in the peripheral lung. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like arrangements of extracellular matrix proteins that serve a variety of functions including the physical separation of cell layers and tissues, molecular ultrafiltration, and tissue morphogenesis (1Timpl R. Brown J.C. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 2Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 3Relan N.K. Schuger L. Pediatr. Dev. Pathol. 1999; 2: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Electron microscopically, typical basement membranes display two distinct zones, the lamina lucida and lamina densa. The lamina lucida contains anchoring filaments that extend to the hemidesmosomes and mediate the attachment of the epithelial cells to the basement membrane. The anchoring of the basement membrane to the mesenchyme is ensured by anchoring fibrils that are associated with the lamina densa and transverse the underlying zone termed sub-lamina densa. Recently, we reported the cloning of the Fras1 gene, which encodes a putative extracellular matrix multidomain protein (4010 amino acids) expressed from various epithelia of the developing embryo (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fras1 contains several distinct domains similar to those found in different proteins such as the C-domain of von Willebrand factor, the cysteine-rich motifs of furin proteases, the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein NG2, and the calcium-binding motif of Na+-Ca2+ exchange proteins. Targeted inactivation of Fras1 reproduces the phenotype of the blebbed (bl) mice that together with eye blebs (eb), myelencephalic blebs (my), head blebs (heb), and fetal hematoma (fh) make up the family of the mouse bleb mutants. These mice are characterized by the formation of sub-epidermal hemorrhagic blisters during embryonic development, unilateral or bilateral renal agenesis or dysgenesis, cutaneous syndactyly, and fused eyelids (5Darling S. Gossler A. Clin. Dysmorphol. 1994; 3: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the similarity of the phenotypic characteristics, the bleb mutant mice have been considered as models for the human hereditary disease Fraser syndrome (6Winter R.M. Clin. Genet. 1990; 37: 494-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This rare genetic disorder presents with cryptophthalmos (fused eyelids), syndactyly, renal agenesis, and a range of other developmental defects including genital malformations, heart anomalies, and abnormalities of the airway and lungs (7Slavotinek A.M. Tifft C.J. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The correlation between the bleb phenotype and Fraser syndrome has been confirmed by the identification of mutations in Fras1 and its human counterpart FRAS1 in blebbed mice and Fraser syndrome patients, respectively (8McGregor L.

Four out of the five bleb mutants (bl, eb, my, and heb) have been mapped on different chromosomes, whereas the fh mutation remains to be mapped (5Darling S. Gossler A. Clin. Dysmorphol. 1994; 3: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This along with the very similar phenotypic features of the bleb mice suggest that at least four of the respective bleb gene products either act synergistically or function independently in distinct but related pathways. Besides the genetic correlation of Fras1 with the blebbed mutation, two additional genes have been recently associated with bleb mice. The gene, Grip1, encoding the glutamate receptor-interacting protein, was found to be mutated in the eye blebs (9Takamiya K. Kostourou V. Adams S. Jadeja S. Chalepakis G. Scambler P.J. Huganir R.L. Adams R.H. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), whereas a new gene termed Fras1-related extracellular matrix gene Frem1 was affected in the head blebs mutants (10Smyth I. Du X. Taylor M.S. Justice M.J. Beutler B. Jackson I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, both gene products are either functionally or structurally related to Fras1. Grip1, a PDZ-containing protein, was shown to interact physically with the short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Fras1 and to be involved in the correct targeting of Fras1 to the basal side of polarized epithelia. Finally, Frem1 shares similarities with Fras1 in the domain organization and is therefore considered as structurally related to Fras1. The above data suggest that the genes affected in the bleb mutants encode proteins structurally and/or functionally related to Fras1, the founding member of the family and the prototype model for Fraser syndrome upon functional deficiency. In Fras1–/– mutants as well as in Fraser syndrome patients, blisters appear exclusively during intra-uterine life in contrast to other known blistering disorders (11Bruckner-Tuderman L. Bruckner P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The blisters form between the dermis and the skin basement membrane that detaches from the dermis together with the epidermal epithelium. This indicates that Fras1 exerts its function at the interface between the epithelial basement membrane and the underlying mesenchyme. However, so far no data exist on the ultrastructural localization of Fras1 within the extracellular matrix. Because respiratory malformations belong to the most common causes of neonatal death of Fraser syndrome patients (7Slavotinek A.M. Tifft C.J. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), here we focused on the developing lung and addressed the issues of Fras1 localization within the extracellular space and the phenotypic abnormalities resulting from Fras1 inactivation. We demonstrate that Fras1 is localized at the basal side of the conducting airway epithelia and of the mesothelial layer of the visceral pleura. Immunogold labeling localized the protein at the ultrastructural level below the lamina densa of the basement membrane zone. Targeted ablation of Fras1 resulted in defective lung lobation and in the disarrangement of blood capillaries in the terminal air sacs. We show that the above malformations are secondary to perturbations in the molecular and structural integrity of basement membranes. Our results thus suggest a role for Fras1 in the functional contact between basement membranes and the underlying mesenchyme. Moreover, these findings assign a function to Fras1 containing basement membranes as physical barriers of blood vessel sprouting. Mice—Fras1–/– mice (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were maintained on the NMRI genetic background in the F5 generation. Antibodies and Immunohistochemistry—Rabbit antibodies to β-galactosidase were purchased from Cappel; rat monoclonal anti-Pecam-1/MEC13.3 was from Pharmingen, and mouse monoclonal anti-T1α was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, hybridoma number 8.1.1 (www.uiowa.edu/~dshbwww), courtesy of Dr. Andrew Farr (12Farr A.G. Berry M.L. Kim A. Nelson A.J. Welch M.P. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-TTF-1 was a gift from R. Di Lauro, and rabbit anti-Nidogen-1 and anti-Agrin were kindly provided by R. Timpl. Rabbit anti-Fras1 was produced as described previously (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Embryos and tissue samples incubated with anti-Pecam-1 antibody were fixed with Zn2+. In all other cases, fixation was performed overnight in 4% PFA 1The abbreviation used is: PFA, paraformaldehyde./phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed specimens were either embedded in paraffin or immersed in O.C.T. embedding medium (BDH) and sectioned at 8 μm. For detection of Fras1, Nidogen-1, Agrin, β-galactosidase, and T1α unmasking of the epitopes was required prior to the application of the primary antibodies. Immunofluorescence staining was achieved by using an appropriate Alexa-488, -568, or Cy5 conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes), and nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide. For peroxidase staining a biotinylated anti-rabbit (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit) secondary antibody was applied and visualized with diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Sections were counterstained with methyl green. Hematoxylin/eosin staining was performed using standard procedures. Specimens were observed and photographed either on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope or on a Leica SP confocal microscope. Preparation of Postnatal Lungs for Immunohistochemistry—Mice were anesthetized and allowed to bleed by sectioning the posterior vena cava. After piercing the diaphragm, lungs were inflated through the trachea with 4% PFA/phosphate-buffered saline at a pressure of 25 cm of H2O until the lungs completely filled the chest cavity. To prevent fixative backflow, the trachea lumen was kept closed, and lungs were dissected out of the rib cage and allowed to fix overnight. After fixation lungs were processed for cryosectioning using standard procedures. Immunogold Staining—Embryos were fixed overnight in 4% PFA, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, and 15% saturated picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, embedded in gelatin, and sectioned at 70 μm with a VT1000S vibrating microtome (Leica). Antibody staining was performed on free floating sections that were preincubated in 20% normal goat serum diluted in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4), for 1 h, and then incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with the primary antibody, diluted in 1% normal goat serum/TBS. After several washes in TBS, sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit affinity-purified Fab′ fragment coupled to 1.4-nm gold particles (Nanoprobes Inc.). Gold particles were enhanced by silver amplification for 8–12 min using the HQ silver kit (Nanoprobes Inc.). Sections were treated with 1% OsO4 and contrasted in 1% uranyl acetate before embedding in epoxy resin (Durcupan ACM, Fluka). Serial electron microscope sections (70–80 nm) were collected on pioloform-coated copper slot grids. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Lungs from E18.5 embryos were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% PFA, post-fixed in 2% aqueous OsO4, stained with 2% tannic acid for 60 min, dehydrated in alcohol, and embedded in a modified Mollenhauer's resin. Ultra-thin sections were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were obtained using a JEOL 100C transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Scanning Electron Microscopy—For scanning electron microscopy, isolated lungs from E18.5 Fras1–/– and control embryos were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% PFA in 0.08 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 24 h at 4 °C, washed in buffer, post-fixed in 2% aqueous OsO4 for 60 min at 4 °C, and dehydrated through a graded series of acetone. Dehydrated samples were critical point dried (Baltec CPD 030) and mounted on copper stubs prior to sputter coating with 20 nm thick gold/palladium (Baltec SCD 050). Samples were examined using a JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron microscope, operating at 20 kV. Images were obtained on Agfa APX professional 120 roll film. Expression and Localization of Fras1 during Lung Development—Fras1 inactivation in mouse was achieved by homologous recombination in which the gene for β-galactosidase was inserted in-frame to Fras1 coding sequences, resulting in a chimeric protein containing the N-terminal signal peptide of Fras1 fused to β-galactosidase (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although the resulting β-galactosidase chimeric protein was properly expressed and reflected endogenous Fras1 expression, it lacked enzymatic activity, most likely because of its improper oligomerization within the secretory pathway (13Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We therefore assayed for Fras1 expression in the developing lung by using antibodies against β-galactosidase on histological sections from Fras1+/– embryos that appear phenotypically normal. β-Galactosidase immunostaining was evident in the mesothelial layer of the visceral pleura and in the epithelia of the conducting tubules but not in the intervening mesenchyme (Fig. 1A), in accordance with our previous findings demonstrating the epithelial origin of Fras1 (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8McGregor L. Makela V. Darling S.M. Vrontou S. Chalepakis G. Roberts C. Smart N. Rutland P. Prescott N. Hopkins J. Bentley E. Shaw A. Roberts E. Mueller R. Jadeja S. Philip N. Nelson J. Francannet C. Perez-Aytes A. Megarbane A. Kerr B. Wainwright B. Woolf A.S. Winter R.M. Scambler P.J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To localize Fras1 during the course of lung development and maturation, we applied Fras1-specific antibodies to sections from the embryonic through the postnatal stages. During the embryonic stages of lung development, Fras1 immunoreactivity delineated the basal side of the mesothelial layer and of the conducting airway epithelia (Fig. 1, B and C). After birth, Fras1 can still be detected underlining the pleura mesothelium, whereas immunoreactivity at the basal side of the respiratory epithelia gradually declined and was completely absent by P12 (Fig. 1D). In the lungs of mice older than 1 month of age, Fras1 was no longer detectable (data not shown), suggesting that it is predominantly required for organ formation during embryonic development rather than for organ function in adult life. Similar to the lung, expression of Fras1 in the skin epithelium was shown to be down-regulated in neonates (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that the restriction of Fras1 expression to embryonic and early postnatal stages could reflect a general mode of Fras1 function. Previous reports demonstrated that dermal-epidermal separation upon blister formation in Fras1–/– mutants occurs below the lamina densa, implying a role for Fras1 at the level of basement membrane-mesenchymal adherence (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8McGregor L. Makela V. Darling S.M. Vrontou S. Chalepakis G. Roberts C. Smart N. Rutland P. Prescott N. Hopkins J. Bentley E. Shaw A. Roberts E. Mueller R. Jadeja S. Philip N. Nelson J. Francannet C. Perez-Aytes A. Megarbane A. Kerr B. Wainwright B. Woolf A.S. Winter R.M. Scambler P.J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). So far, however, no data exist on the ultrastructural localization of Fras1 within the extracellular space. Therefore, we performed pre-embedding immunogold labeling experiments using Fras1-specific antibodies (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that recognize a central domain of the protein homologous to the NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (14Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Prince J.T. Johnstone S.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 114: 359-371Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The Fras1 protein distribution was evident as silver intensified gold particles located below the lamina densa of the basement membrane zone of the airway epithelia (Fig. 1E) and of the mesothelial monolayer (data not shown). These results indicate that a central portion of Fras1 is located within the sub-lamina densa of epithelial basement membranes consistent with the mode of blister formation and dermal-epidermal detachment in Fras1–/– mutants. Fras1–/– Mice Exhibit Pulmonary Lobation Defects—Lung development in the mouse begins around embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) with the formation of the laryngotracheal groove, a ventral protrusion of the foregut endoderm that subsequently separates from the primitive esophagus and bifurcates laterally to generate two symmetrical primary lung buds (15Warburton D. Schwarz M. Tefft D. Flores-Delgado G. Anderson K.D. Cardoso W.V. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 55-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 16Chinoy M.R. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: D392-D415Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Perl A.K. Whitsett J.A. Clin. Genet. 1999; 56: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Under the influence of the surrounding mesenchyme, the epithelial buds begin a process of continuous branching that gives rise to the bilaterally asymmetric bronchial tree. The left lung develops as a single lobe, whereas the right lung consists of four different lobes that are well established by E12. Morphological examination of Fras1–/– lungs at E11.5 revealed that lung bud formation occurred properly (data not shown). However, ∼95% of the analyzed mutants exhibited complete or partial fusion of the right lung lobes (Fig. 2B) compared with wild type controls of the corresponding stage (Fig. 2A). Cross-sections of embryonic lungs demonstrated the presence of five distinct lobes in wild type embryos (Fig. 2C), whereas in the mutants, the medial and caudal lobes appeared completely fused, and the cranial and accessory lobes exhibited some degree of septation (Fig. 2D). The defects in lobar septation of Fras1–/– embryos that are established during the early stages of lung development are maintained throughout embryogenesis and adulthood, suggesting that they do not significantly affect the development of the lung to a functional organ capable of sustaining respiration. Most importantly, the lungs of Fras1–/– embryos displayed the same degree of airway branching as wild type embryos (Fig. 2, E and F), indicating that the lobation abnormalities in Fras1 homozygous mutants are not linked to defects in branching morphogenesis. Fras1 Deficiency Leads to Basement Membrane Distortions in the Embryonic Lung—Given the localization of Fras1 within the extracellular space of epithelial-mesenchymal boundaries, we evaluated the molecular composition of basement membranes in the lung of Fras1–/– embryos by utilizing specific antibody markers. In these experiments, similar regions from the dorsal part of the left lung were compared between wild type and Fras1 homozygous mutants. In E14.5 wild type embryos, Nidogen-1 (18Ekblom P. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Klein G. Zhang H.Y. Kadoya Y. Chu M.L. Mayer U. Timpl R. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2003-2014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) labeled the basement membrane of the visceral pleura, the conducting airways, and additional mesenchymal derivatives (Fig. 3A). Staining for Nidogen-1 on lung sections from Fras1–/– mutants of the same stage produced a markedly attenuated fluorescent signal in the visceral pleura basement membrane (Fig. 3B) as compared with wild type (Fig. 3A). A similar reduction in immunostaining intensity in the visceral pleura basement membrane of Fras1–/– embryos was also observed for the basement membrane markers Agrin (Fig. 3, C and D), laminin-α5, and laminin-γ1 (data not shown). Reduced immunoreactivity of the aforementioned markers, although less prominent than in the visceral pleura basement membrane, was also evident in the basement membrane of the conducting tubules in the lungs of Fras1–/– embryos (Fig. 3, B and D). To assess the specificity of the observed alterations in the lung, we compared the fluorescent signal produced by the above antibody markers in the skin basement membrane of wild type and Fras1–/– embryos. Staining for Nidogen-1 (Fig. 3, E and F) and Agrin (Fig. 3, G and H) in the dermalepidermal junction revealed no apparent difference between wild type and Fras1–/– mutants, suggesting that basement membranes in the lung are more prone to structural destabilization due to Fras1 deficiency, compared with the skin basement membrane. Taken together, the above findings indicate that loss of Fras1 results in basement membrane distortions in the developing lung that are more pronounced in the visceral pleura basement membrane. Normal Differentiation of Respiratory Epithelial Cells in Fras1–/– Mutants—Accumulating evidence indicates that basement membranes, beside their structural function in epithelial-mesenchymal adhesion, play a pivotal role in mediating signals that regulate cell differentiation (19Lonai P. J. Anat. 2003; 202: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Simon-Assmann P. Lefebvre O. Bellissent-Waydelich A. Olsen J. Orian-Rousseau V. De Arcangelis A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 859: 46-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the lung, the mature alveoli are lined by differentiated alveolar type I and II epithelial cells that sustain gas exchange and surfactant production, respectively, and develop from a multipotential primitive epithelium. The differentiation of the epithelial cells in the distal air sacs to type I and II pneumocytes occurs around E17 parallel to the thinning of the mesenchyme and the gradual establishment of the air-blood barrier. To evaluate epithelial cell differentiation in the peripheral lung of Fras1–/– embryos, we employed specific antibody markers in immunohistochemical experiments. TTF-1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor expressed in undifferentiated cuboidal cells in the peripheral respiratory epithelia (21Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 1093-10104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ikeda K. Clark J.C. Shaw-White J.R. Stahlman M.T. Boutell C.J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The onset of cuboidal cell differentiation to squamous type I pneumocytes is accompanied by the down-regulation of TTF-1. At E16.5, TTF-1-specific antibodies labeled the nuclei of virtually all epithelial cells in the terminal bronchi of wild type embryos (Fig. 4A), and at E18.5, TTF-1 was no longer detectable in differentiated squamous epithelial cells (Fig. 4C). Staining for TTF-1 in the lungs of Fras1–/– age-matched embryos produced a pattern similar to wild type (Fig. 4, B and D), suggesting that respiratory epithelial cell differentiation in homozygous mutants occurred normally. We further applied antibodies for the protein markers T1α and pro-SP-C to distinguish between differentiated type I and II pneumocytes, respectively. At E18.5, staining for T1α (Fig. 4, E and F) and pro-SP-C (data not shown) revealed that respiratory epithelial cell differentiation in the terminal air sacs of Fras1–/– embryonic lungs was comparable with wild type, indicating that Fras1 ablation does not affect lung maturation. Basement Membrane Distortions Result in Disarrangement of Blood Capillaries in the Terminal Air Sacs of Fras1–/– Embryonic Lungs—A pivotal process during fetal lung maturation is the establishment of the air-blood barrier to facilitate efficient gas exchange during postnatal life. This occurs during the late gestational stages when dramatic anatomic changes remodel the distal air sacs and result in the close apposition of respiratory epithelia and capillary endothelial cells (23deMello D.E. Sawyer D. Galvin N. Reid L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The fusion of the basement membranes of capillary endothelial and type I epithelial cells results in the formation of a thin air-blood interface (24Hislop A.A. J. Anat. 2002; 201: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). By using antibodies for the endothelial specific protein Pecam-1 and Fras1, we detected Fras1 in the interface between endothelial and respiratory epithelial cells (Fig. 4G) at E18.5, the period of distal air sac remodeling. The above localization of Fras1 prompted us to examine the development of the vasculature in the lungs of Fras1–/– embryos. To visualize blood capillaries and the basement membrane in the distal airways, we used antibodies against Pecam-1 and the basement membrane marker Agrin in double immunostaining experiments. At E16.5, mutant and control lungs displayed no significant differences in the extent of vascular development and in the organization of blood capillaries around the distal airways (data not shown). In E18.5 wild type lungs, blood capillaries, labeled by Pecam-1, appeared well arranged in the terminal air sacs, with regard to a readily conspicuous basement membrane demarcated by Agrin (Fig. 4, H and J). However, in Fras1–/– lungs of the same stage, blood vessels in the terminal sacs appeared strikingly disorganized (Fig. 4I) compared with wild type. Furthermore, blood capillary disarrangement in the peripheral lung of Fras1–/– embryos correlated well with the absence of a distinguishable basement membrane outline (Fig. 4, I and K). Ultrastructural examination of the interface between endothelial and epithelial type I cells showed that basement membranes in Fras1–/– lungs appeared wider and less dense compared with wild type controls (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, endothelial cells were locally detached from the basement membrane in Fras1–/– mutants (Fig. 5C). The loss of adherence of endothelial cells to the basement membrane in the terminal sacs could account for the extravasated erythrocytes that were systematically observed in the respiratory lumen of Fras1–/– lungs (Fig. 5D). The results show that loss of Fras1 affects the basement membrane-endothelial cell attachment and suggest that Fras1-containing basement membranes play an important role in the proper arrangement of blood capillaries around the respiratory epithelia. In the present study we examined the expression and function of Fras1 in the developing mouse lung. Fras1 originates from epithelial cells and was detected in the epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces during lung development. Ultrastructural immunogold labeling using antibodies raised against the central NG2-like domain of Fras1 detected the protein underneath the lamina densa of embryonic lung epithelia. This finding is in accordance with our reported indications that Fras1 exerts its function below the lamina densa (4Vrontou S. Petrou P. Meyer B.I. Galanopoulos V.K. Imai K. Yanagi M. Chowdhury K. Scambler P.J. Chalepakis G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These include the detection of the lamina densa at the roof of the detached epidermis and the loss of collagen VI deposition in the skin basement membrane. Most notably, Fras1 staining displayed a clustered colloidal gold deposition resembling that of collagen VII, which is a component of the anchoring plaques of the sub-lamina densa (25Keene D.R. Sakai L.K. Lunstrum G.P. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 26Bruckner-Tuderman L. Hopfner B. Hammami-Hauasli N. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and that of collagen XVIII, which colocalizes with fibrillar structures underneath the lamina densa (27Fukai N. Eklund L. Marneros A.G. Oh S.P. Keene D.R. Tamarkin L. Niemela M. Ilves M. Li E. Pihlajaniemi T. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The above imply that Fras1 could be a component of an anchoring complex that serves the adhesion of the basement membrane to the underlying matrix. Whether there is a potential colocalization between Fras1 and collagen VII and/or collagen XVIII remains to be determined. Nevertheless, given the length of Fras1 (4010 amino acids), we cannot exclude the possibility that the remaining domains of the protein coincide with other structures of the basement membrane within or below the lamina densa. The phenotype of Fras1–/– lungs includes the incomplete septation of the right lung lobes, disorganization of blood capillaries in the peripheral lung, and extravasation of erythrocytes in the respiratory lumen. Most importantly, fused pulmonary lobes and extravasated erythrocytes have also been reported in Fraser syndrome fetuses (28Ozgunen T. Evruke C. Kadayifci O. Demir C. Aridogan N. Vardar M.A. Int. J. Gynecol. Obstet. 1995; 49: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 29Balci S. Altinok G. Ozaltin F. Aktas D. Niron E.A. Onol B. Prenatal Diagn. 1999; 19: 856-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, Fras1–/– mice are a useful model for the study of lung abnormalities in Fraser syndrome patients. It is not clear whether the lung malformations described in this study contribute to neonatal lethality observed both in Fras1–/– mice as well as in Fraser syndrome patients. The lobar septation defects are evident in homozygous animals that survive, indicating that the above malformation does not interfere with viability. It is, however, possible that more severe cases of erythrocyte extravasation could lead to lung hemorrhage and neonatal death due to respiratory insufficiency. A recent study (30Nguyen N.M. Miner J.H. Pierce R.A. Senior R.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 246: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported that mice deficient for laminin-α5, a basic component of basement membranes, exhibit incomplete separation of lung lobes, although branching morphogenesis was not affected. This demonstrated that pulmonary lobation and branching morphogenesis can be independent processes contrary to previous assumptions (31Aoyama H. Fujii S. Hojo H. Teramoto S. Teratology. 1994; 50: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 32Motoyama J. Liu J. Mo R. Ding Q. Post M. Hui C.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 33Lim L. Kalinichenko V.V. Whitsett J.A. Costa R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1012-L1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of the visceral pleura basement membrane in laminin-α5-deficient embryos was considered as the primary cause for the lobar septation defects. In contrast to laminin-α5 knock-out embryos, the visceral pleura basement membrane in Fras1–/– mutants remains detectable both at the ultrastructural level (not shown) as well as with antibody fluorescent markers. Loss of Fras1 rather seems to cause perturbations in the molecular composition of the visceral pleura basement membrane, suggesting that not only the complete absence but even distortions in the integrity of the visceral pleura basement membrane could impair normal lobation in the mouse lung without disturbing epithelial branching morphogenesis. Fras1 deficiency further affected the structural integrity of the respiratory epithelia basement membrane. Our results identified a correlation between the proper organization of blood capillaries around the distal air sacs and the structural integrity of the basement membrane. The disarrangement of blood capillaries observed in the lungs of Fras1–/– mutants implicates Fras1 in the maintenance of a barrier function of basement membranes on blood vessel protrusion. This could be accomplished either by the contribution of Fras1 to basement membrane structural integrity or, alternatively, by a direct interaction between Fras1 and endothelial cells. Indeed, both the localization of Fras1 in the sub-lamina densa and the presence of endothelial basement membrane detachment sites in the lungs of Fras1–/– embryos argue for a role of Fras1 in preserving basement membrane-mesenchymal contact. The disruption of endothelial cell basement membrane attachment could be the primary cause for the extravasation of erythrocytes observed in the respiratory lumen of Fras1–/– embryos. These findings lead to the intriguing hypothesis that Fras1 exerts a similar function also in the skin basement membrane. The loss of the barrier properties of the skin basement membrane on blood vessel protrusion resulting from Fras1 dysfunction could provide the basis to explain the hemorrhagic nature of the blisters that occur in utero in Fras1–/– embryos, in the absence of mechanical friction or trauma. Previous studies (33Lim L. Kalinichenko V.V. Whitsett J.A. Costa R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1012-L1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Stolz D.B. Shin B.

Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the Foxf1+/– phenotype was accompanied by reduced levels of BMP4 and vascular endothelial growth factor (34Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Stolz D.B. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, elevated levels of BMP4 inhibited expression of Foxf1 (35Mahlapuu M. Enerback S. Carlsson P. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2397-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These indicate that defects in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and/or growth factors of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily could account for the lung malformations of the Foxf1+/– embryos. Given the apparent similarity of the lung phenotypes between Fras1–/– and Foxf1+/– embryos, it is conceivable that Fras1, besides its structural role, could be involved in the modulation of the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor, BMP4, or other transforming growth factor-β-related proteins. This could be accomplished through the N-terminal cysteine-rich repeats of Fras1 that share strong similarity to chordin- and furin-type cysteine motifs that have been implicated in the regulation of the activity of members of the transforming growth factor-β family (36Dubois C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2067429173,"Vitamin D receptor-interacting protein 150 (DRIP150) has been identified as part of mediator-like complexes that enhance transcriptional activation of the estrogen receptor (ER) and other nuclear receptors (NRs). DRIP150 coactivates ligand-dependent ERα-mediated transactivation in ZR-75 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transfected with a (luciferase) reporter construct (pERE3) regulated by three tandem estrogen-responsive elements. Coactivation of ERα by DRIP150 in ZR-75 cells was activation function 2-dependent and required an intact helix 12 that typically interacts with LXXLL motifs (NR box) in p160 steroid receptor coactivators. DRIP150 contains C- and N-terminal NR boxes (amino acids 1182–1186 and 69–73, respectively), and deletion analysis of DRIP150 showed that regions containing these sequences were not necessary for coactivation of ERα. Analysis of multiple DRIP150 deletion mutants identified a 23-amino-acid sequence (789–811) required for coactivation activity. Analysis of the protein crystal structure data base identified two regions at amino acids 789–794 and 795–804, which resembled α-helical motifs in Lanuginosa lipase/histamine N-methyltransferase and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1, respectively. By using a squelching assay and specific amino acid point mutations within each α-helix, the NIFSEVRVYN (795–804) region was identified as the critical sequence required for the activity of DRIP150. These results demonstrate that coactivation of ERα by DRIP150 in ZR-75 cells is NR box-independent and requires a novel sequence with putative α-helical structure."
