https://openalex.org/W1999633796,"The mouse vomeronasal organ (VNO) is thought to mediate social behaviors and neuroendocrine changes elicited by pheromonal cues. The molecular mechanisms underlying the sensory response to pheromones and the behavioral repertoire induced through the VNO are not fully characterized. Using the tools of mouse genetics and multielectrode recording, we demonstrate that the sensory activation of VNO neurons requires TRP2, a putative ion channel of the transient receptor potential family that is expressed exclusively in these neurons. Moreover, we show that male mice deficient in TRP2 expression fail to display male-male aggression, and they initiate sexual and courtship behaviors toward both males and females. Our study suggests that, in the mouse, sensory activation of the VNO is essential for sex discrimination of conspecifics and thus ensures gender-specific behavior."

Here we examined TGF-α processing in a physiologically relevant cell model, primary keratinocytes, showing that cells lacking TACE activity shed dramatically less TGF-α as compared with wild-type cultures and that TGF-α cleavage was partially restored by infection of TACE-deficient cells with TACE-encoding adenovirus. Moreover, cotransfection of TACE-deficient fibroblasts with pro-TGF-α and TACE cDNAs increased shedding of mature TGF-α with concomitant conversion of cell-associated pro-TGF-α to a processed form. Purified TACE accurately cleaved pro-TGF-α in vitro at the N-terminal site and also cleaved a soluble form of pro-TGF-α containing only the ectodomain at the C-terminal site. In vitro, TACE accurately cleaved peptides corresponding to cleavage sites of several epidermal growth factor (EGF) family members, and transfection of TACE into TACE-deficient cells increased the shedding of amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) proteins. Consistent with the hypothesis that TACE regulates EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand availability in vivo, mice heterozygous for Tace and homozygous for an impaired EGFR allele (wa-2) were born with open eyes significantly more often than Tace+/+Egfrwa-2/wa-2counterparts. Collectively, these data support a broad role for TACE in the regulated shedding of EGFR ligands.

For example, proteases activate latent forms of transforming growth factor-β (1.Rifkin D.B. Mazzieri R. Munger J.S. Noguera I. Sung J. APMIS. 1999; 107: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and hepatocyte growth factor (2.Naldini L. Tamagnone L. Vigna E. Sachs M. Hartmann G. Birchmeier W. Daikuhara Y. Tsubouchi H. Blasi F. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4825-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), regulate interactions between insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins (3.Nakamura T. Nawa K. Ichihara A. Kaise N. Nishino T. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and mediate the release of numerous soluble growth factors from their membrane-anchored precursors (4.Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In the case of membrane-anchored growth factors, the proteolytic processing has been proposed to regulate the availability of active, soluble forms, switch receptor signaling from autocrine or juxtacrine modes to paracrine or endocrine mechanisms, and/or influence the nature (e.g. duration) of the signaling event. Growth factors and cytokines that are released from membrane-anchored forms include members of the EGF1 superfamily, colony-stimulating factor-1, TNF-α, and the Kit ligand (4.Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The EGF superfamily includes two structurally related subfamilies: the EGF-like growth factors and the neuregulins (5.Lee D.C. Fenton S.E. Berkowitz E.A. Hissong M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 51-85PubMed Google Scholar). The EGF subfamily also includes TGF-α, amphiregulin (AR), HB-EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin as well as the recently described epigen (5.Lee D.C. Fenton S.E. Berkowitz E.A. Hissong M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 51-85PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Strachan L. Murison J.G. Prestidge R.L. Sleeman M.A. Watson J.D. Kumble K.D. J. Biol.

Soluble EGF family growth factors are all derived by proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomains of integral membrane precursors. However, the precursors display no significant homology outside of the 40–50-amino acid EGF-like motif that is the shared bioactive and structural feature of this family. Proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus of the EGF-like sequence, required to release soluble forms, generally occurs within 15 amino acids of the transmembrane domain despite the absence of a consensus cleavage site. In contrast, cleavage at the N terminus of the EGF motif is variable. Many cell types release varying levels of larger bioactive forms of TGF-α in addition to the mature, 50-amino acid growth factor due to cleavage at the C-terminal site only (7.Ignotz R.A. Kelly B. Davis R.J. Massagué J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8.Luetteke N.C. Michalopoulos G.K. Teixidó J. Gilmore R. Massagué J. Lee D.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the EGF-like domains of HB-EGF and AR are typically released with N-terminal extensions rich in basic residues that confer heparin binding ability (9.Cook P.W. Mattox P.A. Keeble W.W. Pittelkow M.R. Plowman G.D. Shoyab M. Adelman J.P. Shipley G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 10.Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In both cases, multiple cleavage sites that are N-terminal to the basic domains have been observed (11.Shoyab M. McDonald V.L. Bradley J.G. Todaro G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6528-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,12.Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol.

The proteolytic processing of EGF family members shares several characteristics with the general phenomenon of ectodomain shedding of cell surface proteins. It is a regulated event that can be rapidly induced upon exposure of cells to phorbol esters, calcium ionophores, serum factors, and phosphatase inhibitors (13.Pandiella A. Massagué J. Proc. Natl.

A major advance was the identification of a novel protease, tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), responsible for converting membrane-anchored TNF-α to its soluble form (20.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S.

Willard D. Becherer J.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). TACE is a member of a family of integral membrane proteins termed ADAMs (ADisintegrin andMetalloproteinase) that contain multiple conserved domains, including a catalytic domain with homology to the adamalysin family of metzincin proteases, an extracellular disintegrin sequence, and a cytoplasmic domain with putative signaling motifs (reviewed in Ref.22.Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The potential importance of TACE in EGF family shedding was demonstrated through a germ line mutation in mice that eliminated the zinc-binding domain (TaceΔZn), thereby inactivating the protease (23.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar).TaceΔZn/ΔZnmice exhibited wavy hair and skin and eye defects identical to those observed in mice lacking transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) (24.Luetteke N.C.

March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Moreover, TACE-deficient mice died perinatally, exhibiting widespread epithelial defects reminiscent of EGFR-deficient mice (26.Threadgill D.W. Dlugosz A.A. Hansen L.A. Tennenbaum T. Lichti U. Yee D. LaMantia C. Mourton T. Herrup K. Harris R.C. Barnard J.A. Yuspa S.H. Coffey R.J. Magnuson T. Science. 1995; 269: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 27.Miettinen P.J. Berger J.E.

Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that TACE might regulate the availability of EGF family ligands (23.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J.

In this report, we provide several lines of evidence derived from in vitro, cell-based, and whole animal studies that establish TACE as a major pro-TGF-α convertase. We also provide evidence consistent with a role for TACE in mediating the release of other EGF family members, especially AR and HB-EGF. Finally, we show that limiting the gene dosage of TACE exacerbates the phenotype of a weak EGFR allele (waved-2) in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate a broad role for TACE in regulating EGFR activity. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 was obtained from Sigma, anti-HA was obtained from Covance (Berkeley, CA), and anti-Myc 9E10 was obtained from Sigma or Covance. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Nucleic Acid Core Facility. All animals were housed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine. The TaceΔZn mutation was carried on a C57BL/6 × 129 hybrid background (23.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N.

Mice harboring the Egfrwa-2 mutation (B6EiC3H-a/A-Egfrwa-2/wa-2Wnt3avt) and the corresponding hybrid control strain (B6EiC3H) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).TaceΔZn/ΔZnand Egfrwa-2/wa-2 mice were initially identified phenotypically (open eye at birth and wavy hair, respectively) and subsequently verified by PCR amplification of genomic tail DNAs. Littermate controls were used for all experiments. Newborn mice were killed by halothane inhalation. Primary epidermal keratinocytes were prepared as described elsewhere (30.Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar) and cultured in Keratinocyte SFM (Invitrogen) with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS). For conditioning, cells were grown to near confluence, washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and shifted to 1% FBS medium containing 100 ng/ml EGF (added to improve recovery of soluble TGF-α). Media were collected after 48 h and concentrated using Sep-Pak C-18 reverse phase cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) as described previously (31.Sandgren E.P. Luetteke N.C. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Lee D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 1121-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To collect cell lysates, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA assay kit (Pierce), and TGF-α levels in media and lysates were analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (32.Russell W.E. Dempsey P.J. Sitaric S. Peck A.J. Coffey Jr., R.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1731-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were produced as described (33.He T.-C. Zhou S. Costa L.T.d. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) using pAdTrackCMV and pAdEasy-1 adenoviral vectors kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University). AdTACE virus was created by subcloning a C- terminal Myc-tagged TACE cDNA into pAdTrackCMV. Primary epidermal keratinocytes from TaceΔZn/ΔZnmice were grown to 70% confluence and infected with control virus or AdTACE virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. Conditioned media and cell lysates were harvested after 24 h and analyzed for TGF-α content by RIA as described above. All cDNAs used in this study were expressed from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Epitope-tagged pro-TGF-α is described elsewhere (34.Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pro-TGFecto was created from the full-length epitope-tagged construct by removing sequences between the TGF-α juxtamembrane domain and the C-terminal FLAG tag using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mouse AR cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR. Murine HB-EGF cDNA was kindly provided by Michael Klagsbrun (Harvard Medical School). Carl Blobel (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) kindly provided modified forms containing C-terminal Myc epitopes. We subsequently inserted HA tags near the N terminus of the EGF-like domain but C-terminal to the heparin-binding domain of each growth factor precursor using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. A Myc tag was introduced at the C terminus of murine TACE using a PCR strategy. The resulting product was subcloned into the TACE cDNA, and the presence of the epitope was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primers used for mutagenesis were: for pro-TGFecto, 5′-GGCTGCCAGCCAGAAGAAGCAAGATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGG-3′; for AR, 5′-GGCAGAAGGAATAAGAAGAAAAAGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTAATCCATGCACTGCC-3′; for HB-EGF, 5′-GGGGTTAGGGAAGAGATACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGACCCATGCCTCAGG-3′; and for TACE: 5′-CCGAGATCTAGCAACAAGGTGTGTGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTCGAGCTAAAGGTCCTCCTCGGAGATCAGCTTCTGCTCGCACTCTGTCTCTTTGCT-3′ (reverse). Wild-type and TaceΔZn/ΔZnfibroblasts (clones EC-4 and EC-2 (35.Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected in serum-free media with the indicated expression vectors using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and, after 24 h, returned to complete media containing 100 ng/ml EGF. Conditioned media and lysates were collected 24 h later and treated as described above. Equivalent amounts of protein (50–100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore; Bedford, MA), and membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk. Membranes were incubated with 1:1000 dilutions of primary antibody followed by 1:10,000 dilutions of peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Resulting bands were visualized using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent detection system and autoradiography. For N-terminal cleavage, lysate from a rodent cell line stably overexpressing epitope-tagged TGF-α (34.Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was incubated with ∼200 units of partially purified native TACE (through the Mono-Q step in Ref. 20.Black R.A. Rauch C.T.

Resulting products were identified by SDS-PAGE/Western blot as described above. For sequencing of TACE cleavage products, lysates from the same cells were pooled and enriched for pro-TGF-α using anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pro-TGF-α was eluted with FLAG peptide, and eluates were pooled and concentrated using Centricon-10 concentrators (Millipore). Concentrated pro-TGF-α was incubated with ∼2 μg of the recombinant human TACE extracellular domain (36.Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14598-14607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The products were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Sequi-blot polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad), and stained with Coomassie Blue according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identity of Coomassie bands was confirmed by a parallel Western blot of a small portion of the reaction. The appropriate bands were excised from the membrane for N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation (37.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems 494Ht sequencer. For C-terminal cleavage, medium from COS-1 cells transfected with the pro-TGFecto construct was combined and concentrated via Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge as described above. Sep-Pak eluates were lyophilized, resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and concentrated in Centricon-10 concentrators. Aliquots of the resulting solution were incubated with ∼1 μg of recombinant human TACE extracellular domain (36.Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14598-14607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For determination of the C-terminal cleavage site, reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The anti-FLAG beads were spotted directly onto a target, and the molecular weights of the peptides were determined at the University of North Carolina Proteomics Core Facility by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF-MS) using a Bruker Reflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker Instruments Co, Billerica, MA). 2C.

Peaks resulting from the TACE reaction were compared with those from a negative control (beads only) and a synthetic peptide, VVAASQKKQDYKDDDDKVV, matching the sequence of the expected product. To determine the sequence of the 1811-m/zproduct, beads were prepared as above and analyzed by MALDI-MS/MS on an API QSTAR-Pulsar mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 3C. S.

Statistical analysis was performed with assistance from the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center's Biostatistics Shared Resource Group. We showed previously that polyclonal Ras/Myc-transformed TaceΔZn/ΔZnembryonic fibroblasts shed about 20-fold less TGF-α into the medium as compared with wild-type counterparts (23.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

RIA analysis showed that newborn TaceΔZn/ΔZnkeratinocytes released 12-fold less TGF-α as compared with Tace+/+ counterparts (Fig. 1). Northern blots revealed equivalent TGF-α mRNA levels in the two cell populations (not shown) excluding differences in TGF-α expression as an explanation for the difference in shedding. Both genotypes also exhibited similar amounts of keratin 5 (not shown), a marker of basal keratinocytes, indicating that differences in shedding were not accounted for by alterations in TaceΔZn/ΔZnkeratinocyte differentiation. Consistent with a previous report that induced shedding of transfected TGF-α requires metalloproteinase activity (16.Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), both TACE-dependent as well as the residual release of endogenous TGF-α in TaceΔZn/ΔZnkeratinocytes were sensitive to the hydroxamic acid compound, IC-3 (20.Black R.A.

Shedding by Tace+/+ cells was inhibited 10-fold in the presence of IC-3, whereas release from TaceΔZn/ΔZnkeratinocytes was inhibited >4-fold (Fig. 1). To determine whether reintroduction of TACE restores pro-TGF-α processing, we infected TaceΔZn/ΔZnkeratinocytes with either control adenovirus (Ad) (33.He T.-C. Zhou S. Costa L.T.d. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) or virus-expressing mouse TACE cDNA (AdTACE). Staining for virus-encoded green fluorescent protein confirmed comparable infection by the two vectors. AdTACE infection of TaceΔZn/ΔZncells increased TGF-α shedding about 4-fold as compared with cells infected with Ad (Fig. 1). The failure to fully restore TGF-α shedding may be due to incomplete infection of the cell population. It is unlikely that the incomplete restoration of TGF-α shedding reflects a dominant negative effect of the TaceΔZn allele; the mutant TACE protein encoded by the TaceΔZn allele does not function as a dominant negative since TNF and L-selectin were released at wild-type levels from Tace+/ΔZn cells (23.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

Besides mature, 50-amino acid TGF-α, many cell types also release larger forms of the growth factor due to cleavage at the C-terminal site only (7.Ignotz R.A. Kelly B. Davis R.J. Massagué J. Proc.

To determine whether reintroduction of TACE into TaceΔZn/ΔZncells reconstituted complete processing of the TGF-α precursor, we transiently transfected these cells with pro-TGF-α containing HA and FLAG epitopes (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2031671750,"Angiogenesis is a complex biological process involving the coordinated modulation of many genes. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are a growing family of enzymes that mediate the availability of chromatin to the transcriptional machinery. Trichostatin-A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), two HDAC inhibitors known to relieve gene silencing, were evaluated as potential antiangiogenic agents. TSA and SAHA were shown to prevent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC) from invading a type I collagen gel and forming capillary-like structures. SAHA and TSA inhibited the VEGF-induced formation of a CD31-positive capillary-like network in embryoid bodies and inhibited the VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the CAM assay. TSA also prevented, in a dose-response relationship, the sprouting of capillaries from rat aortic rings. TSA inhibited in a dose-dependent and reversible fashion the VEGF-induced expression of VEGF receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and neuropilin-1. TSA and SAHA upregulated the expression by HUVEC of semaphorin III, a recently described VEGF competitor, at both mRNA and protein levels. This effect was specific to endothelial cells and was not observed in human fibroblasts neither in vascular smooth muscle cells. These observations provide a conspicuous demonstration that HDAC inhibitors are potent anti-angiogenic factors altering VEGF signaling."

Our data indicate that E2F up-regulates the expression of genes not previously described as E2F target genes. A number of these E2F-regulated genes are involved in DNA replication, DNA repair and mitosis. These results suggest that E2F affects cell cycle progression both at S phase and during mitosis.

It has been proposed, on the basis of genetic experiments, that ETA is activated in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the protein encoded by the gene Rv3854c (DeBarber, A.

Our results establish that the enzyme (EtaA) is an FAD-containing enzyme that oxidizes ETA to the corresponding S-oxide.

Drugs such as isoniazid (INH)1 and rifampicin have historically been successful in the treatment of tuberculosis infections. In recent history, however, poor compliance with the prolonged and complicated chemotherapeutic regimens currently used to treat the disease (3.Bass Jr., J.B. Farer L.S. Hopewell P.C. O'Brien R.

Care Med. 1994; 149: 1359-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), in conjunction with the advent of the AIDS epidemic and the increased mobility of human populations, has led to the emergence of numerous multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains (4.Pablos-Mendez A. Raviglione M.C. Laszlo A. Binkin N. Rieder H.L. Bustreo F. Cohn D.L. Lambregts-van Weezenbeek C.S. Kim S.J. Cahulet P. Nunn P. N. Eng. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Resistance to frontline therapeutics, most notably INH and rifampicin, results in treatment of patients with “second-line” agents that are less effective and/or more toxic. Among these second tier drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, one of the most effective is ethionamide (ETA) (5.Crofton J. Chaulet P. Maher D. Grosset J. Harris W. Norman H. Iseman M. Watt B. Guidelines for the Management of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis. World Health Organization, Geneva1997Google Scholar). ETA (1, Fig. 1), like INH, is thought to be a prodrug that must be converted to its active form by the bacterial cell. Both ETA and INH, when activated, appear to disrupt cell wall biosynthesis and have at least one common cellular target, the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA (6.Banerjee A. Dubnau E.

Support for a common site of action can be deduced from gene array studies demonstrating that both ETA and INH induce similar patterns of gene expression in M. tuberculosis (8.Wilson M. DeRisi J. Kristensen H.-H. Imboden P. Rane S. Brown P.O. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12833-12838Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence for a common site of action, INH and ETA are activated by different mechanisms as resistance to INH does not confer resistance to ETA (9.Rist N. Grumback F. Libermann D. Am. Rev. Tuberc. Pulm. Dis. 1959; 79: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). INH is now known to be oxidized by the bacterial catalase-peroxidase KatG to a reactive species, probably an acyl free radical, that is eventually responsible for its bacterial toxicity (10.Johnsson K.

Mutations in KatG that diminish or annihilate its activity toward INH are responsible for a large proportion of the INH-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Until recently, however, the enzyme that activates ETA has remained obscure (14.DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.-G. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence homology studies using the Rv3854c gene as a template indicate that the protein responsible for ETA activation may be a flavin monooxygenase (14.DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M.

In vivo mammalian and bacterial studies suggest that the first metabolite of ETA is the thioamide S-oxide (ETA-SO, 2, Fig. 1), which retains the biological activity of the parent drug (16.Johnston J.P. Kane P.O. Kibby M.R. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1967; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17.Pütter V.J. Arzneim.-Forsch. 1972; 22: 1027-1031PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Von M.

Other metabolites identified in whole cell bacterial systems include the nitrile (3), amide (4), and alcohol (6) derivatives of ETA (Fig. 1) (14.DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.-G. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recently two laboratories independently reported identification of a gene, Rv3854c, in the M. tuberculosis genome that codes for a protein that activates ETA (14.DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.-G. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15.Baulard A.R. Betts J.C. Engohang-Ndong J. Quan S. McAdam R.A.

Genetic and transfection experiments provided strong evidence for the biological role of the Rv3854c encoded protein (EtaA) in the activation of ETA. However, the actual enzyme was not isolated, and its nature remains speculative. Herein we report cloning, heterologous expression, purification, and characterization of the Rv3854c gene product. Our results establish that the enzyme responsible for ETA activation is an FAD-containing enzyme, provide information on the catalytic and physical properties of this enzyme, and demonstrate that it catalyzes two steps rather than one step in the activation of ETA. All chemicals, including NADPH, were purchased from Aldrich or Sigma, were of ACS grade or better, and were used without further purification. All the enzymes used in cloning procedures were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and were used with buffers from the same company. Protein purification was done at 4 °C. Once purified, the protein was stored at −70 °C and was found to be stable for at least 4 months at that temperature. HPLC columns were purchased from Alltech Associates, Inc. UV-visible spectra were obtained on either a Hewlett Packard model 8254A diode array instrument or a Varian Cary 1E spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Unity 400 MHz instrument. Mass spectra were obtained using a Thermoquest Finnigan LCQDECA electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap spectrometer. HPLC was performed on a Hewlett Packard Series 1090 liquid chromatograph equipped with either a Rheodyne model 7125 manual sample injector or an autosampler. All activity and steady state kinetic assays were conducted by monitoring the formation of the product ETA-SO (2). Product formation was measured at 350 nm over a time of 5–10 min using the Cary 1E split beam spectrophotometer. The molar extinction coefficient of ETA-SO in the reaction system was experimentally determined to be 6,000 (±4%) m−1 cm−1. The reaction medium contained 50 mm Tris buffer (pH = 7.5), 100 mm KCl, catalase (100 units/ml), superoxide dismutase (100 units/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), and an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (2 units/ml), glucose 6-phosphate (250 mm), and either NADP+ or NADPH. The final concentration of enzyme was typically 500 nm in FAD. ETA stock solutions (25 mm) were freshly prepared in acetonitrile, and the final added volume never exceeded 1% of the total reaction volume. All stock solutions were kept on ice prior to mixing within the cuvette. The enzymatic reaction was typically initiated by adding substrate (ETA) to the sample cuvette containing the reaction medium plus the enzyme and an equivalent volume of acetonitrile to the reference cuvette. The reference cell contained all solution components except for enzyme and substrate (ETA), allowing for accurate correction of any NADPH absorption in the region of interest. Prior to addition of substrate, the reaction and reference mixtures were thermally equilibrated in the cuvettes at 37 °C for 2 min. ETA-SO was prepared from ETA following a modification of a published protocol (20.Jenner P.J. Ellard G.A. Gruer P.J.K. Aber V.R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1984; 13: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ETA (1.45 g, 8.72 mmol) was suspended in absolute ethanol (7 ml) immersed in a room temperature water bath. Hydrogen peroxide (30% (v/v), 922 μl, 9.59 mmol) was added slowly while monitoring the solution temperature. The temperature was never allowed to exceed 35 °C. After all of the H2O2 was added, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 45 min. The reaction was monitored by TLC (silica on plastic, eluent: 90% ethyl acetate, 10% methanol) and quenched with 3 ml of water when the reaction was ∼90% complete. The solvent was removed in vacuo resulting in an orange oil. Recrystallization at −20 °C from hot chloroform layered with diethyl ether yielded 172 mg (0.944 mmol) of a bright yellow microcrystalline solid.

The reaction was carried out under a dry argon atmosphere with flame-dried glassware. Following a published procedure (21.Bose D.S. Kumar K.K. Synth. Commun. 2000; 30: 3047-3052Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), CH2Cl2 (10 ml) was transferred by syringe to a round bottom flask charged with ETA (333.5 mg, 2.01 mmol), and the suspension was cooled to 0 °C. First triethylamine (635 μl, 4.50 mmol) and then 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate (315 μl, 2.29 mmol) were added dropwise. The reaction was monitored by silica TLC (eluent: 30% ethyl acetate in hexanes) for product formation. The solution was stirred under argon for 1.5 h, allowing it to warm to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water (10 ml) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 15 ml). The organic layer was then washed with brine and dried with Na2SO4. The solvent was then removed in vacuo, and the resultant residue was purified on a silica column (12.5 × 2.3 cm, l × diameter) packed in a mixture of 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes. The product was eluted using a gradient of 10–15% ethyl acetate in hexanes (5%/100 ml).

Following a published procedure (22.Cacchi, S., Misiti, D., and La Torre, F.

A solution of 3(84 mg, 0.635 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (62 mg, 0.188 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (0.318 ml) was cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath. To the cooled solution, 30% aqueous H2O2 (0.424 ml) was slowly added followed by 20% (w/w) aqueous NaOH (0.339 ml). The solution was vigorously stirred for 2 h, allowing the solution to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (10 ml), and the organic layer washed with an equal volume of brine and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was purified on an alumina column (8.5 × 2.3 cm, l × diameter) packed in ethyl acetate. The product was eluted using a gradient of 0–20% CH2Cl2 in ethyl acetate (5%/100 ml). This procedure yielded 57 mg (0.38 mmol) of pure product (50% purified yield) as a white solid: 1H NMR (d6-Me2SO, 400 MHz) [δ (ppm)] 1.251 (3H, t, CH2CH3), 2.808 (2H, q, CH2CH3), 7.576 (1H, d, 5-H), 7.654 (2H, br s, 3-H and NH2), 8.190 (1H, br s, NH2), 8.596 (1H, d, 6-H);13C NMR (d6-Me2SO, 400 MHz) [δ (ppm)] 13.594, 30.617, 118.743, 119.636, 141.724, 149.450, 163.483, 166.541 liters; UV-visible [λmax (nm)] 50 mm Tris (pH = 7.5), 276; ESI IonTrap MS, observed m/z 151.29 (M + H)+, calculated for C8H10N2O 150.20. The nitrile,3 (529 mg, 4 mmol), was dissolved in water (10 ml). Concentrated H2SO4 (4 eq) was then added, and the solution was refluxed for 4 h. The reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 to remove the residual starting material before the aqueous layer was basified to pH = 10 with aqueous NaOH. The water was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was redissolved in methanol and filtered. The sodium salt of the acid (153 mg, 0.884 mmol) was obtained as a yellowish powder following evaporation of the methanol: 1H NMR (CD3OD, 400 MHz) [δ (ppm)] 1.273 (3H, t, CH2CH3), 3.024 (2H, q, CH2CH3), 8.153 (1H, d, 5-H), 8.248 (1H, s, 3-H), 8.636 (1H, d, 6-H); UV-visible [λmax (nm)] 216; ESI IonTrap MS, observed m/z 150.0 (M − H)−, calculated for C8H9NO2 151.18. Thiobenzamide (686 mg, 5 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (5 ml), and the solution was warmed to 30 °C before H2O2 (30%, 1.2 eq) was added dropwise. The solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, and the pyridine was then removed under reduced pressure to yield yellow crystals of thiobenzamide S-oxide: TLC analysis (5% ethyl acetate, pentane) RF(starting material) = 0.22, RF (product) = 0.61; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) [δ (ppm)] 7.8 (1H, m, para-H), 8.1 (2H, dd,meta-H), 8.3 (1H, br s, NH2), 8.4 (2H, dd,ortho-H), 8.6 (1H, br s, NH2); UV-visible [λmax (nm)] 50 mm Tris (pH = 7.4), 330 nm. The gene was obtained as an insert in the pMH29 vector from Clifton Barry III and Andrea E. DeBarber (National Institutes of Health). PCR was used to amplify the insert with NdeI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. The primers used for the PCR were: 5′-end, 5′-GCGTGGACATATGACCGAGCACCTCG; 3′-end, 5′-CTAAAGCTTCGCTAAAGCTAAACCCCC (the restriction sites are underlined). The insert was ligated into the pCWori expression vector containing a poly-His insert at the 5′-end of the coding sequence just prior to the start codon. Sequencing was used to confirm that the full-length gene without alterations in the sequence was inserted into the expression vector. The expression vector was transformed into commercial (Invitrogen) competent DH5α Escherichia colicells, and protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside once the cells grew to A600 = 0.9. Cells were grown for 24 h postinduction at 22 °C and were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g. The E. coli cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (300 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 6 mmimidazole, pH = 7.4), lysed, and sonicated. The cytosolic fraction was removed after centrifugation at 25,000 × g. This supernatant was loaded directly onto a Ni-NTA affinity column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH = 7.4. After loading, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with a gradient over 10 column volumes of 0–200 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris (pH = 7.4) containing 500 mmNaCl and 10% glycerol. The fractions containing the pure Rv3854c gene product (EtaA), as determined by sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled and concentrated. Imidazole was removed from the protein solution by passing it through a Sephadex G-25M size exclusion column (elution buffer: 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, pH = 7.4) with a final yield of ∼15 mg of pure protein/liter of culture. Fast protein liquid chromatographic analysis of the protein was done on a Superdex 75 FPLC column eluted at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH = 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl and 10% glycerol. Thin layer chromatographic comparison of the prosthetic group extracted from the recombinant flavoprotein with authentic FMN and FAD was done on silica gel using water as the elution solvent. The flavins could be detected visually due to their bright yellow/orange color. The enzymatic reactions with ETA, thiobenzamide, isothionicotinamide, and thiacetazone were analyzed by HPLC, and the metabolites were identified, where possible, by comparison with authentic standards. The enzymatic reaction was run for 3 h at 37 °C using conditions identical to those described for the kinetic assays. The crude reaction mixture was filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter (Millex®-GV low protein binding Durapore membrane) and analyzed, without further modification, by HPLC on a Whatman Partisil® C8 reverse-phase column (particle size, 5 μm; 250- × 4.6-mm inner diameter) equipped with a C8 guard column (particle size, 5 μm; 7.5- × 4.6-mm inner diameter). The solvent system consisted of 0.01% formic acid in water (A) and 0.01% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The mixture was eluted with a gradient of 1–8.3% B over 30 min. The eluent was monitored at 284 and 350 nm, and complete UV-visible spectra of the metabolite peaks were collected for comparison with authentic standards. Genetic experiments, including expression in intact cells, have implicated the protein encoded by Rv3854c in the bioactivation of ETA to a form of the drug with direct antimycobacterial activity (14.DeBarber A.E.

The metabolic products of ETA suggest that the protein in question is likely to be a monooxygenase (15.Baulard A.R. Betts J.C. Engohang-Ndong J. Quan S. McAdam R.A. Brennan P.J. Locht C. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28326-28331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The transformations are consistent with the involvement of either a cytochrome P450 or a flavin monooxygenase, but the protein sequence encoded by Rv3854c is more consistent with a flavoprotein (14.DeBarber A.E.

To elucidate the precise nature of the enzyme involved in the activation of ETA and the nature of the transformation(s) that it catalyzes, we have cloned and expressed Rv3854c in E. coli. The protein was expressed with a poly-His tag to facilitate purification of the protein. Expression of two constructs, one with the poly-His tag at the amino terminus and the other with the tag at the carboxyl terminus, gives protein with similar catalytic properties, indicating that the poly-His tag does not interfere with catalytic function (all subsequent experiments were conducted with the amino-terminally His-tagged protein). An exploration of expression conditions led to production of the enzyme in yields of 15 mg of purified protein/liter of medium. The protein was highly purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as shown by the fact that even at high concentrations the protein gives rise to a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The specific activity of the protein product at different stages of the purification procedure, measured as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and as discussed below, is shown in Table I.

Preliminary results suggest that the protein can be reconstituted with exogenous flavin. Open table in a new tab The NADPH consumption and sulfoxidation activities are reported. EtaA, as expected from the predicted length of 488 amino acids, migrates with a molecular mass of ∼55 kDa (Fig. 2). FPLC analysis of EtaA on a Superdex column shows that the protein elutes as a single peak but at a molecular weight that corresponds to that of an oligomeric (3–4-mer) species, suggesting that EtaA aggregates in solution. UV-visible spectra of solutions of EtaA exhibit maxima at 365 and 440 nm in agreement with its identification as a flavoprotein (Fig. 3). Furthermore, extraction of the prosthetic group by boiling EtaA for 5 min and sedimenting the denatured protein by centrifugation yields a supernatant with a spectrum identical to that of authentic FAD (Fig. 3). Quantitation of the flavin released from denatured EtaA yields a ratio of flavin to protein of 1:1.3, indicating that the protein binds one flavin group. Thin layer chromatographic comparison of the extracted prosthetic group (RF = 0.9) with authentic FAD (RF= 0.9) and FMN (RF = 0.1) showed that the prosthetic group has the retention time of FAD and not FMN. Rv3854c clearly codes for a flavoprotein with a single FAD prosthetic group. The identity of the metabolite(s) produced in the reaction of purified EtaA with ETA and NADPH was determined by letting the reaction proceed for 3 h, separating the products by reverse-phase HPLC, and comparing the peaks with authentic (synthetic) standards. The standards that were available were the S-oxide (2), 2-ethyl-4-cyanopyridine (3), 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine (4), and 2-ethyl-4-carboxypyridine (5), all of which have been reported as metabolites from the in vivo mycobacterial oxidation of ETA (14.DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.-G. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 16.Johnston J.P. Kane P.O. Kibby M.R. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1967; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The two major metabolic products observed with this method had retention times of 9.1 and 14.9 min. The two peaks were identified as the amide (4) and ETA-SO (2), respectively, by comparison with the elution time and spectrum of the synthetic standards (tR(4) = 9.1 and tR(2) = 14.9 min) (Fig. 4). Since ETA-SO exhibits similar antimycobacterial activity as ETA (14.DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.-G. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), it was important to determine whether the amide metabolite (4) is a product of EtaA metabolism of ETA-SO or a product of an alternate enzymatic oxidation of ETA. The synthetic ETA-SO standard was therefore incubated with EtaA and NADPH as described above for incubations with ETA. A further oxidative transformation was detected by HPLC (Fig. 4). The second oxidation product co-elutes with the 9.1-min metabolite observed in the HPLC analyses of the ETA incubations, indicating that the enzyme is capable of metabolizing ETA-SO to the amide (4) (Fig. 4). EtaA was further implicated in the direct metabolism of ETA and ETA-SO by analysis of 3-h (37 °C) incubations of either ETA or ETA-SO with and without enzyme in the presence of NADPH and with and without NADPH in the presence of the enzyme. In both sets of experiments no metabolism or decomposition of either ETA or ETA-SO was observed by HPLC when either the enzyme or NADPH was omitted. As might be expected for a flavoprotein, both NADPH and O2 are required for formation of both the ETA sulfoxidation product (2) and the amide (4) by EtaA. Omission of NADPH, or running the reaction under anaerobic conditions, suppressed product formation. Furthermore, NADH could not be substituted for NADPH in the reaction (data not shown). The catalytic activity of purified EtaA with respect to ETA was evaluated by measuring the initial rate of ETA-SO formation. The rate of ETA sulfoxidation was monitored at 350 nm (see “Experimental Procedures” for specific assay conditions). The Km, Vmax, and kcat values for the oxidation of ETA were found, from analysis of Lineweaver-Burke double-reciprocal plots, to be 194 (±3%) μm, 1.46 (±3%) nmol of ETA-SO min−1, and 7.73 (±5%) mol of ETA-SO min−1mol−1, respectively (inset, Fig. 5). Spectroscopic analysis of the reaction of EtaA with ETA in the presence of an NADPH-regenerating system demonstrates a clean initial conversion of ETA to ETA-SO as evidenced by a clear isosbestic point at 309 nm (Fig. 5). To determine the degree of substrate specificity of EtaA, we have examined the oxidation of"

Here we investigated the subcellular localization of caspase-2 in healthy cells and during the execution of the apoptotic program. We have found that caspase-2 is a nuclear resident protein and that its import into the nucleus is regulated by two different nuclear localization signals. We have shown that in an early phase of apoptosis caspase-2 can trigger mitochondrial dysfunction from the nucleus without relocalizing into the cytoplasm. Release of cytochrome c occurs in the absence of overt alteration of the nuclear pores and changes of the nuclear/cytoplasmic barrier. Addition of leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export, did not interfere with the ability of caspase-2 to trigger cytochrome c release. Only during the late phase of the apoptotic process can caspase-2 relocalize in the cytoplasm, as consequence of an increase in the diffusion limits of the nuclear pores. Taken together these data indicate the existence of a nuclear/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway elicited by caspase-2."

https://openalex.org/W2320342345,"Persistent high risk type human papillomavirus (HR–HPVs) infections induce dysplasia or cancer of the anogenital tract, most notably of the uterine cervix. The viral genome usually persists and replicates as an episomal molecule in early dysplasia, whereas in advanced dysplasia or cervical cancer HPV genomes are frequently integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell. Previous studies suggested that modification of critical cellular sequences by integration of HPV genomes might significantly contribute to the neoplastic transformation of anogenital epithelia (insertional mutagenesis). This prompted us to characterize the integration loci of high risk HPV genomes in a large set of genital lesions. We amplified E6/E7 oncogene transcripts derived from integrated HPV16 and HPV18 genomes and characterized in detail the co-transcribed cellular sequences of 64 primary genital lesions and five cervical cancer cell lines. Database analyses of the cellular parts of these fusion transcripts revealed 51 different integration loci, including 26 transcribed genes (14 known genes, 12 EST sequences with unknown gene function). Seventeen sequences showed similarity to repetitive elements, and 26 sequences did not show any database match other than genomic sequence. Chromosomal integration loci were distributed over almost all human chromosomes. Although we found HPV sequences integrated into cancer related genes and close to fragile sites, no preferential site or integration motif could be identified. These data demonstrate that target directed insertional mutagenesis might occur in few HPV-induced anogenital lesions, however, it is rather the exception than the rule."

These interactions have the potential to destabilize the THC, which is already more sensitive for glacial conditions than for the present-day climate, thus providing an explanation for the increased variability of glacial climate."

However, the neuroprotective effects of estrogen are hypothesized to safeguard against the development of AD and not to aid in recovering lost function. The biological mechanism(s) through which estrogen exerts its neuroprotective effects remain largely unknown; hypotheses have included modulation of basal forebrain cholinergic activity, dendritic plasticity, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor density, and regulation of neurotrophin signaling pathways (7.McEwen B.S.

This Aβ burden is reversible with post-surgical estrogen replacement. In addition, a recent study (12.Schonknecht P. Pantel J. Klinga K. Jensen M. Hartmann T. Salbach B. Schroder J. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 307: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) demonstrates an inverse relationship between the levels of 17β-E2 and Aβ42, the more amyloidogenic Aβ variant, in the cerebrospinal fluid of female patients with AD. In summary, results from retrospective clinical trials, recent and on-going animal studies, and corroborating cell culture data all support the hypothesis that post-menopausal cessation of estrogen production may facilitate Aβ deposition and that the clinical efficacy of ERT may be due, in part, to a direct Aβ-lowering effect.Aβ is proteolytically derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) within the secretory pathway by distinct enzymatic activities known as β- and γ-secretase (reviewed in Refs. 13.Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar and 14.Greenfield J.P. Gross R.S. Gouras G.K. Xu H. Front.

Aggregated Aβ peptides are found predominantly within the extraneuronal space and are believed to initiate toxic and inflammatory cascades leading to neuronal death. The major population of secreted Aβ peptides is generated within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (15.Xu H. Sweeney D. Wang R. Thinakaran G. Lo A.C. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Full-length βAPP is transported in TGN-derived secretory vesicles to the cell surface if not first proteolyzed to Aβ or an intermediate metabolite. At the plasma membrane βAPP is either cleaved to produce a soluble molecule βAPP (18.Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, reinternalized within clathrin-coated vesicles to an endosomal/lysosomal degradation pathway (19.Caporaso G.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 608-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the distribution of βAPP between the TGN and cell surface has a direct influence upon the relative generation of soluble βAPP versus Aβ. This phenomenon makes delineation of the mechanisms responsible for regulating βAPP trafficking from the TGN biologically relevant.The formation of TGN vesicles is initiated by the coordinated assembly of coat protein complexes on the cytoplasmic face of donor biological membranes (reviewed in Ref. 21.Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). This complex of cytosolic coat proteins with phospholipid bilayers is necessary to generate coated buds and vesicles. Among the lipids involved in bud formation, phosphatidylinositol (PI) plays a unique role. Its inositol head group can be phosphorylated at single or multiple sites to give rise to a variety of phosphoinositides that can be substrates for enzymes including PI kinases, phospholipase C, and PI-directed phospholipase D (22.Robinson L.J. Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These enzymes produce soluble inositol polyphosphates that in turn act as second messengers. These reactions also alter the levels of specific phosphoinositides. Together these effects organize vesicular traffic both spatially and temporally.Estrogen has also been suggested to alter late secretory pathway vesicle formation. Specifically, electron microscopy in neuroendocrine cells demonstrated an increase in secretory vesicle formation after exposure to estrogen (23.Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, other steroid molecules such as glucocorticoids have been suggested to regulate trafficking of vesicles from the TGN to the plasma membrane (24.Kain S.R. Platt E.J. Brown K.S. Black N. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8128-8135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Platt E.J. Goodman L.J. Kain S.R. Zettl K.S. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence, a direct link between estrogen and known mechanisms involved in vesicle formation has not been shown. However, studies (26.Chen D. Ganapathy P. Zhu L.J. Xu X. Li Q. Bagchi I.C. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 993-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Drouva S.V. LaPlante E. Leblanc P. Bechet J.J.

Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have suggested promising directions for further exploring the link between estrogen and secretory pathway trafficking. For example, transcriptions of methylating enzymes involved in the conversion of phospholipids, and Rab11, a small GTPase involved in the targeting of transport vesicles to the plasma membrane, are up-regulated in response to estrogen (26.Chen D. Ganapathy P. Zhu L.J. Xu X. Li Q. Bagchi I.C. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 993-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Drouva S.V. LaPlante E. Leblanc P. Bechet J.J. Clauser H. Kordon C.

Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In the present study we demonstrate using a cell-free budding assay that estrogen stimulates the budding of βAPP-containing vesicles from the TGN. This alteration in βAPP trafficking leads to a significant decrease in Aβ generation. In addition, we examine the cell biological mechanism underlying this clinically relevant observation. First, we demonstrate that estrogen exposure initiates the recruitment of Rab11 from the cytosol to the TGN. In addition, expressing a C-terminally truncated mutant Rab11 that does not interact with membranes leads to increased Aβ formation, an effect attenuated by 17β-E2. These results suggest a mechanism in which increased Rab11 recruitment to TGN membranes helps initiate budding of vesicles containing βAPP. A separate series of experiments revealed that estrogen also increases the level of PI in the TGN. Furthermore, cell-free assays performed with yeast cytosol containing mutant PITP, a potent PI regulator, corroborate that PI levels are regulated by estrogen and are integral to the budding of βAPP. Taken together, the effects of estrogen on Rab11 localization and PI levels contribute to increased TGN budding and decreased βAPP in the TGN. These changes result in decreased Aβ generation and may explain the diminished recovery of Aβ seen in response to estrogen treatment in cell culture and AD animal models.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell LinesNeuroblastoma (N2a) cells doubly transfected with human βAPP695 and human wild-type PS1 were maintained in medium containing 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Opti-MEM, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 200 μg/ml G418 (or 350 μg/ml Zeocin for Rab11 expressing cell lines) (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in the absence or presence of 200 nm 17β-E2 (Sigma) for 7 days. In some experiments, cells were treated with various concentrations of 17β-E2, 17α-E2, and/or tamoxifen (Sigma).Neuronal CulturesPrimary neuronal cultures were derived from the cerebral cortices of embryonic day 17 (E17) rat or E14 mouse embryos obtained from timed pregnant animals (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) as described previously (9.Xu H.

Cortices were triturated in glass pipettes until cells were dissociated. Cells were counted in a hemocytometer and plated in equal amounts in serum-free Neurobasal media with N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 25 mm glutamate, and 0.5 mml-glutamine on poly-d-lysine-treated (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) 100-mm dishes (Fisher) (∼8–10 × 106cells per plate) for biochemical analyses. For human mixed brain cultures, cerebrocortical tissue was isolated from gestational age 8–12-week aborted fetuses (Karolinska Hospital, Sweden). Cultures were maintained in the absence or presence of 200 nm 17β-E2 for 7 days. Media were replaced every 2 days. Over 95% of cells in the preparations were neurons (9.Xu H. Gouras G.K.

The reagent was dissolved in PBS with calcium and magnesium, pH 7.2, at 0.5 mg/ml and added twice to the cultures for 20 min at 4 °C. After thorough washing, the cells were lysed with 3% SDS as described above. βAPP was immunoprecipitated by using 369 antiserum (9.Xu H. Gouras G.K. Greenfield J.P. Vincent B. Naslund J.

Biotinylated βAPP was detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and reaction with a chemiluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Sucrose GradientsTo separate and enrich TGN and ER membranes, cells were homogenized using a stainless steel ball-bearing homogenizer in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgAc2, and a protease inhibitor mixture in a final concentration of 1 volume of cell pellet per 5 volumes of homogenizing medium. The homogenate was loaded on top of a step gradient composed of 1 ml of 2 m sucrose, 4 ml of 1.3m sucrose, 3.5 ml of 1.16 m sucrose, and 2.0 ml of 0.8 m sucrose. All solutions contained 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgAc2. The gradients were centrifuged for 2.5 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of each gradient and assayed for total protein by the method of Bradford. Aβ was assayed by running fractions on 4–12% SDS-PAGE, transferring the proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and performing Western blot analysis with 4G8, FCA3440, and FCA3642.Preparation of Permeabilized N2a CellsIt has been well established that incubation of cells at 20 °C leads to an accumulation of membrane and secretory proteins in the TGN (15.Xu H. Sweeney D. Wang R. Thinakaran G. Lo A.C. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17.Greenfield J.P. Tsai J.

To assay Aβ generation, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (500 μCi/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS (prewarmed to 20 °C), and chased for 2 h at 20 °C in complete media prewarmed to 20 °C. Cells were incubated at 4 °C in “swelling buffer” (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) for 10 min. The buffer was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of “breaking buffer” (90 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2), after which the cells were broken by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, washed in 3–5 ml of breaking buffer, and resuspended in 5 volumes of breaking buffer. This procedure resulted in >95% cell breakage evaluated by staining with trypan blue. Broken cells (∼2 × 106 cells) were incubated in a final volume of 300 μl containing 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 110 mm KCl, and an energy-regenerating system (ERS) consisting of 1 mm ATP, 0.02 mm GTP, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, 80 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Incubations were carried out at 20 or 37 °C as indicated. Each experiment was performed at least 3 times.Formation of Nascent Secretory Vesicles in Permeabilized CellsFollowing incubation of broken cells, vesicle and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 s at 4 °C in a Brinkman centrifuge. Vesicle (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions were extracted with a cell lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% deoxylcholate. In some experiments, membrane fractions were further extracted with 70% formic acid and neutralized with 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3.ImmunoprecipitationExtracted proteins from the various fractions were brought to 0.5% SDS and heated for 3 min at 75 °C. Samples were treated with IP buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100) and the appropriate antibody added. After incubating overnight, samples were treated with protein A-Sepharose, and immunoprecipitable material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10–20% Tricine gels (for Aβ species) or 4–12% Tris glycine gels (for full-length βAPP).Neuronal TGN BuddingNeurons were labeled with [35S]methionine (500 μCi/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C and washed with PBS. To isolate TGN membranes, cells were homogenized using a stainless steel ball-bearing homogenizer in 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgAc2, and a protease inhibitor mixture in a final concentration of 1 volume of cell pellet per 5 volumes of homogenizing medium. The homogenate was loaded on top of a step gradient composed of 1 ml of 2 m sucrose, 4 ml of 1.3 m sucrose, 3.5 ml of 1.16 m sucrose, and 2.0 ml of 0.8 msucrose. All solutions contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgAc2. The gradients were centrifuged for 2.5 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed for the presence of TGN-38 by Western blot to determine the fraction of TGN membrane enrichment. This fraction was removed from the gradient, and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in 0.25m sucrose for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended in 300 μl containing 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 110 mm KCl, and an ERS consisting of 1 mm ATP, 0.02 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 80 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Incubations were carried out at 20 or 37 °C as indicated. Vesicles were isolated and proteins analyzed as described above. Each experiment was performed at least 3 times.Preparation of Cytosol Fraction from Yeast Secretory MutantsCells were grown at 24 °C in yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose (YPD) medium to early log phase. 200A600 units were centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm. Cells were washed twice by dilution in reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm KOAc) and once in homogenization buffer (reaction buffer plus, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm DTT). 400 μl of acid-washed glass beads were added, and cells were lysed for 8 30-s periods of agitation in a vortex at full speed. The samples were mixed with 600 μl of homogenization buffer and vortexed four times, each for 30 s at full speed, followed by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. After transferring to Eppendorf tubes, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. 50-μl aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen after protein was measured by the Bradford assay and stored at −80 °C.Preparation of Mammalian Cytosol FractionTen plates of cells were collected in their media and washed with TEA buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 140 mm KOAc, pH 7.2) followed by a wash in homogenization buffer (25 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm KOAc, protease inhibitor mixture) and resuspension in 1 volume of pellet/5 volumes of homogenization buffer. Cells were broken in a Ballet homogenizer (clearance 18 μm) and a post-nuclear supernatant created by centrifuging at 800 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. 50-μl aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen after protein was measured by the Bradford assay and stored at −80 °C.Lipid ExtractionFractions from the sucrose gradients were diluted to 1-ml total volume if necessary, transferred to 13 × 100 borosilicate test tubes, and mixed with 3.25 ml of chloroform/methanol 1:2.2 (29.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). The samples were vortexed and centrifuged to pellet proteins. Supernatants were transferred to clean tubes and phase separated by adding 1 ml each of chloroform and 20 mm acetic acid. After aspirating the upper phases, lower phases were reduced in volume by evaporation under a nitrogen stream and dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator.Phospholipid AnalysisFor phospholipid analysis, samples were diluted with 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and 10-μl aliquots from each were spotted onto a TLC plate. Plates were developed in chloroform/ethanol/triethylamine/water (30:35:35:7) and visualized by spraying with 3% copper(II) acetate in 8% phosphoric acid followed by charring. Quantitation for phospholipids was performed on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager in the blue fluorescence mode.Inositol Lipid Extraction and AnalysisThe method of Pike and Eakes (30.Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. 1-ml fractions were transferred to 13 × 100-mm borosilicate tubes containing 1 ml of methanol/concentrated HCl (10:1, v/v) and vortexed with 2 ml of chloroform. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase discarded. The organic phase was re-extracted with 1 ml of methanol, 1m HCl (1:1), phase separated, and the upper phase discarded. The lower organic phase was evaporated under a nitrogen stream and then dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator. Samples were dissolved in a minimal amount of chloroform/methanol/water (5:5:1) and spotted onto TLC plates, impregnated with 1% potassium oxalate and developed in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (17:13.2:2.8:1). Tritiated phosphatidylinositols were detected by autoradiography, and their identity was determined by co-migration with authentic standards.DensitometryBand intensities were analyzed and quantified using NIH ImageQuant software, version 1.52.RESULTSEstrogen Accelerates βAPP Transport from trans-Golgi NetworkPrior studies demonstrated a significant decrease in levels of secreted Aβ from cells pre-treated with 200 nm17β-E2 for 1 week (9.Xu H.

By utilizing a cell-free reconstitution system derived from βAPP-expressing neuroblastoma (N2a) cells, we examined whether these decreases were secondary to alterations in βAPP trafficking. The cell-free system has been used extensively as a vehicle within which βAPP trafficking and Aβ generation have been studied (15.Xu H. Sweeney D. Wang R. Thinakaran G. Lo A.C. Sisodia S.S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).N2a cells treated without or with 200 nm 17β-E2 for 1 week were labeled with [35S]methionine and incubated at 20 °C to accumulate βAPP in the TGN. Cells were permeabilized and returned to 37 °C. Cell-free reconstitution of βAPP-containing vesicle budding was followed by centrifugation at 4 °C to halt further βAPP trafficking and processing and to separate nascent vesicles from donor membranes (see “Materials and Methods” for details).βAPP was isolated by membrane solubilization, immunoprecipitation using a C-terminal-specific antibody (369), and separation using SDS-PAGE. A minor βAPP band is sometimes detected, which may be attributable to incomplete maturation of βAPP. At 20 °C, it is possible that glycosylation is delayed or inhibited. To test this, samples were treated with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and were found to be largely resistant to proteolysis (data not shown) suggesting that immature βAPP accounts for only a small percentage of total βAPP. In addition, it is possible that this band is partially accounted for by endogenous mouse βAPP. βAPP recovered from TGN-derived vesicles after a 90-min in vitro incubation represents 14% of the original pool of labeled βAPP within the TGN. Performing the assay at 20 °C, or omitting the ERS reduces the percentage of βAPP recovered from TGN-derived vesicles to 3.5 and 7%, respectively, of t"

PHCC-TPx encodes a preprotein of 232 amino acids containing a putative N-terminal chloroplast targeting sequence and three conserved Cys residues (Cys107, Cys136, and Cys155). The mature form of enzyme without the signal peptide was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was found to utilize thioredoxin (Trx) but not GSH as an electron donor. In the presence of a Trx system, the protein efficiently reduces H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides. Complementation analysis shows that overexpression of the PHCC-TPx restores resistance to oxidative stress in yeast mutants lacking GSH but fails to complement mutant lacking Trx, suggesting that the reducing agent of PHCC-TPx in vivo is not GSH but is Trx. Mutational analysis of the three Cys residues individually replaced with Ser shows that Cys107 is the primary attacking site by peroxide, and oxidized Cys107 reacts with Cys155-SH to make an intramolecular disulfide bond, which is reduced eventually by Trx.

Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The challenge may be even greater for plants than for other eukaryotes because plants not only occupy fixed positions in constantly changing environments but they also consume O2 during respiration and generate it during photosynthesis (2.Foyer C.H. Lelandais M. Kunert K.J. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 92: 696-717Crossref Google Scholar). To cope with the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species, aerobic organisms are equipped with antioxidant enzymes, which include catalases, superoxide dismutases, and ascorbate- and thioredoxin (Trx)1-dependent peroxidases (APx and TPx, respectively) (3.Levine A. Tenjaken R. Dixon R. Lamb C. Cell. 1994; 79: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). In addition, most eukaryotes contain antioxidant proteins termed glutathione peroxidases (GPx), which reduce hydroperoxides with glutathione (GSH) as an electron donor. There are at least five GPx isoforms in mammals, such as including the classical cellular and cytoplasmic GPx (called cGPx or GPx1), gastrointestinal GPx (called giGPx or GPx2), extracellular plasma GPx (called pGPx or GPx3), phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (called PHGPx or GPx4), and epididymis-specific secretory GPx (called eGPx or GPx5) (4.Ursini F. Miaorino M. Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohe L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). These isozymes differ with respect to structure, substrate specificity, and tissue distribution. All animal GPx family members, except for the recently described Cys-containing pGPx (5.Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and eGPx isoforms (6.Perry A.C. Jones R. Niang L.S. Jackson R.M. Hall L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), possess selenocysteine (SeCys) at their active site. Whereas PHGPx and eGPx exist as a monomer, the other GPx isoforms form tetramers of identical subunits. Whereas the preferred PHGPx substrates are phospholipid hydroperoxides, cGPx and pGPx can reduce H2O2 and fatty acid hydroperoxides more effectively than phospholipid hydroperoxides (7.Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, it is noteworthy that the in vitro reduction of hydroperoxides by pGPx and PHGPx proteins requires nonphysiologically high concentrations of GSH (4.Ursini F. Miaorino M. Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohe L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Besides the mammalian GPx families, several plant GPx cDNAs have been isolated from diverse plant sources. It has been demonstrated that most plant GPx proteins have a primary structure similar to those of animal PHGPx enzymes, except that the SeCys in the catalytic site is replaced by Cys in plant enzymes (8.Churin Y. Schilling S. Borner T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9.Holland D. Ben-Hayyim G. Faltin Z. Cmoin L. Strosberg D. Eshda Y. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the existence of many plant GPx proteins has been inferred from primary nucleotide sequences, only one protein, from Citrus sinensis, has been experimentally shown to possess PHGPx activity (10.Beeor-Tzahar T. Ben-Hayyim G. Holland D. Faltin Z. Eshdat Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide was used as a substrate, and the activity of this enzyme was found to be unusually low (11.Eshdat Y. Holland D. Faltin Z. Ben-Hayyim G. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 234-240Crossref Google Scholar). The protein also is not able to reduce H2O2 with GSH as an electron donor under various assay conditions. Similar properties have also been reported for mammalian PHGPx proteins, for which the rate constant for phospholipid hydroperoxide as a substrate is an order of magnitude smaller than that for cGPx (12.Esworthy R.S. Chu F.F. Geiger P. Girotti A.W. Doroshow J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We were intrigued by these results and therefore decided to identify the physiologically relevant electron donor for plant non-SeCys PHGPx enzymes. In this report we show that Trx is an efficient electron donor for the PHGPx homologue protein of Chinese cabbage in the reduction of H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides. Unlike previously characterized 1Cys- and 2Cys-TPx proteins (recently renamed Prx enzymes), the Trx-dependent peroxidase (TPx) activity of this enzyme is significantly affected by the mutation of each of the three Cys residues individually replaced with Ser, and it maintains monomeric state during the catalytic process of H2O2 reduction. Therefore, we designate the enzyme PHCC-TPx, for PHGPx homologue ofChinese cabbage with TPxactivity. H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, GSH, yeast GSH reductase (GR), and bovine cGPx were purchased from Sigma. Yeast Trx, Trx reductase (TR), glutaredoxin (Grx), and glutamine synthetase (GS) were obtained from Escherichia coli transformants as reported (13.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide was prepared as described (7.Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA with extensive homology to the Arabidopsis thaliana PHGPx was identified in the course of a random sequencing of flower-specific cDNAs prepared from Chinese cabbage (14.Lim C.O. Kim H.Y. Kim M.G. Lee S.I. Chung W.S. Park S.H. Hwang I. Cho M.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AF411209). To produce recombinant protein, the PHCC-TPx open reading frame was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX and expressed in the E. colistrain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The protein was purified by the procedure described previously (15.Cheong N.E. Choi Y.O. Lee K.O. Kim W.Y. Hong C.H. Jung B.G. Jeong J.S. Kim K. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The antioxidant activity of PHCC-TPx was demonstrated by monitoring the ability of the protein to inhibit the inactivation of GS in the presence of DTT/Fe3+/O2 as described (16.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity was measured by the decrease in the A340 in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mmH2O2, various amounts of protein, and an electron donor, either the Trx system consisting of 0.3 mmNADPH, 10 μm Trx, 1 μm TR or the GSH system containing 0.3 mm GSH, 1 μm GR, and 0.3 mm NADPH (13.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the investigation of substrate specificity, H2O2 was replaced with various concentrations of t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, or phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. Data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. Point mutation of specific amino acids in PHCC-TPx was performed by a PCR-mediated mutagenesis technique as described (17.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). After the mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing, the mutant genes were expressed in E. coli. To express PHCC-TPx in yeast cells, we used the shuttle vector pYES2, which contains the URA3selectable marker and the GAL1 promoter. A sequence encoding the mature form of PHCC-TPx without the N-terminal signal sequence was cloned downstream of the GAL1 promoter. The PHCC-TPx expressing plasmid was introduced into yeast strains lacking GSH (18.Ullmann P. Gondet L. Potier S. Bach T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or Trx (19.Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) by the lithium-acetate method (20.Ito H. Fukude Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed cells were first grown in YPD until mid-log phase, allowing the glucose repression of the GAL1 promoter to be relieved, and diluted in YPGal medium containing 2% galactose to induce transcription of PHCC-TPx. After growing the cells to a density of 0.3 at 600 nm, cell viability was evaluated by spotting 10-μl serial dilutions of each culture on YPGal agar plates containing 1.5 mm H2O2. As controls, the same procedures were applied with clones of yeast GPx3 (21.Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) or TPx1 (13.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) gene. Protein bands were excised from gels and washed as described (23.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). After reduction and alkylation, in-gel trypsin digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. Sample application to the MALDI target was carried out by the solution phase nitrocellulose method (24.Landry F. Lombardo C. Smith R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed on a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Mass spectra were subjected to two-point internal calibration with the des-Arg1 bradykinin peak (m/z904.4681) and the angiotensin I peak (m/z1296.6853). To date, many reports have described the isolation and characterization of PHGPx proteins from various organisms. When we examined these studies, we thought that the catalytic activity reported for these enzymes with phospholipid hydroperoxides as substrates was too low to allow them to be considered true GPx proteins. To address this concern, we have isolated and characterized a gene encoding a PHGPx from a Chinese cabbage cDNA library. The translation product of the isolated cDNA, PHCC-TPx, shares high sequence homology with other plant GPx proteins, especially in the three domains of G1–G3, which are the most distinctive structural motifs of GPx proteins (Fig. 1). These widely spaced domains contain highly conserved amino acids, including a Cys residue at a position occupied by SeCys in mammalian GPx proteins and a Gly residue in domain G1, a Gln residue in domain G2, and a Trp-Asn-Phe motif in domain G3. These residues are believed to form the catalytic triad of GPx proteins (25.Epp O. Landenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Also the PHCC-TPx, like Arabidopsis and pea PHGPx, contains an extra peptide at its N terminus that resembles peptide sequences found in proteins imported into and processed in chloroplasts (26.Mullineaux P.M. Karpinski S. Jimenez A. Cleary S.P. Robinson C. Creissen G.P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Considering features common to nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins (27.Karlin-Neumann G.A. Tobin E.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and sequence comparison of PHCC-TPx with those of chloroplast and cytosolic GPx proteins of plant sources (26.Mullineaux P.M. Karpinski S. Jimenez A. Cleary S.P. Robinson C. Creissen G.P. Plant J. 1998; 13: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the amino acid at position 62 of Asn is presumed to be cleaved at the chloroplast membrane. The removal of the transit peptide from PHCC-TPx is predicted to produce about 20-kDa mature protein. When we represent the relationship between the amino acid sequence of PHCC-TPx and those of other GPx isoforms as a dendrogram, it is apparent that PHCC-TPx clearly belongs to the same branch of the phylogenetic tree as do PHGPx proteins and that the PHGPx group is definitely distinct from other GPx isoforms (Fig. 2).Figure 2Phylogenetic tree of GPx proteins from plant and mammalian sources. GPx sequences of plant and human sources are described in Fig. 1 and mammalian sequences of Mus musculus (Mm GPx1–4), Sus scrofa (DpGPx), Bos taurus (Bt GPx), Rattus rattus (Rr eGPx), and Macaca fascicularis(Mf eGPx) are retrieved from the SwissProt data base. The sequences are aligned and compared with construct a phylogenetic tree using the Jotun Hein method of MegAlign program. PHCC-TPx identified from this paper is shown in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the electron donor for PHCC-TPx, we expressed PHCC-TPx with or without the N-terminal signal peptide in E. coli using the pGEX expression vector. The yield of recombinant protein expressed from the full-length PHCC-TPxcDNA was low, and most protein was found in inclusion bodies (data not shown). Thus, we analyzed the biochemical properties of PHCC-TPx with the soluble, mature protein that lacks the N-terminal transit peptide and contains 170 amino acid residues, from amino acid positions 63 (Leu) to 232 (Ala). Although the SeCys-containing GPx proteins specifically use GSH as an electron donor, there have been few reports on the GSH-dependent reduction of H2O2 by Cys-containing PHGPx proteins. Indeed, during the course of this work, a paper appeared which showed that the Plasmodium falcifarum PHGPx utilizes Trx, but not GSH, as an electron donor for H2O2reduction (28.Sztajer H. Gamain B. Aumann K.-D. Slomianny C. Becker K. Brigelius-Flohe R. Flohe L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7397-7403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Also, Bjornstedt et al. (29.Bjornstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the mammalian isoform of nonselenium pGPx uses Trx and Trx reductase (TR), instead of GSH, to reduce hydroperoxides. Therefore, we compared the efficiency of the Trx (Trx, TR, and NADPH) and GSH (GSH, GR, and NADPH) systems in providing reducing power for PHCC-TPx in the reduction of H2O2. The velocity of peroxidase-linked NADPH oxidation in the presence of the Trx system exhibits characteristic first-order kinetics (Fig. 3), and the reaction rate is proportional to the concentration of PHCC-TPx (data not shown). With the Trx system, PHCC-TPx catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 more efficiently than does yeast TPx1 used as a control (Fig. 3A). However, virtually no peroxidase activity is detected for PHCC-TPx in the presence of the GSH system, even when large amounts of GSH are added (Fig. 3B). On the contrary, bovine cGPx shows a significant catalytic activity toward H2O2 in the presence of a physiologically relevant concentration of GSH (10 μm), but the activity is completely lost when the GSH system is replaced with the Trx system. Moreover, the oxidation of NADPH by PHCC-TPx is negligible in the absence of any of the three components of the Trx system, as compared with the extent of oxidation observed in the presence of all three components (data not shown), which is a property typical to TPx proteins (16.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Based on these characteristics, we measured the initial rates of NADPH oxidation catalyzed by PHCC-TPx with various concentrations of Trx and compared the kinetic parameters with those reported for yeast TPx1, which are similar to the values obtained in our assay conditions (22.Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Lineweaver-Burk plots (data not shown) revealed that the Vmax and Kmvalues for Trx are 35 μmol/min/mg of protein and 4.2 μmfor the reaction catalyzed by PHCC-TPx, respectively (Table I). These values are about 6- and 2-fold higher, respectively, than those for yeast TPx1. Moreover, the Km values of PHCC-TPx toward H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, and t-butyl hydroperoxide, are 4.9, 5.5, and 11.7 μm, respectively, which are slightly higher than those described for yeast TPx1 (22.Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Also, the Vmaxvalues for PHCC-TPx measured with each of the three peroxides are 17.2, 7.6, and 14.3 μmol/min/mg of protein for the reduction of hydroperoxides. The catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of PHCC-TPx are generally higher than those of yeast TPx1 for all of the substrates used in this experiment. However, only negligible PHCC-TPx activity was detected when phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide was used as a substrate (data not shown), which is consistent with results reported for the P. facifarum PHGPx (28.Sztajer H. Gamain B. Aumann K.-D. Slomianny C. Becker K. Brigelius-Flohe R. Flohe L. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab By having established that Trx is an electron donor for PHCC-TPx, we were intrigued by the absolute conservation of the three Cys residues in PHCC-TPx. To explore this observation further, we investigated the role of each Cys residue in catalytic activity by replacing each individually with Ser. And an additional amino acid, Gln142, reported to be a part of catalytic triad of mammalian GPx proteins (25.Epp O. Landenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) was also included to analyze its role in H2O2 reduction by converting it to the smallest amino acid, Gly. After mutant (C107S, C136S, C155S, and Q142G) and wild-type (WT) proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified from the soluble fraction of bacterial cells, we evaluated the peroxidase activity of each protein toward H2O2in the presence of the Trx system. The C107S and C155S mutant proteins are completely incapable of H2O2 reduction, but the C136S mutant retains about 30% WT TPx activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that all the three Cys residues are important in H2O2reduction. However, the Q142G mutant protein gives no effect on TPx activity of PHCC-TPx, providing that the Gln142 does not participate in H2O2 catalysis by using Trx as an electron donor. Next, we examined the ability of the WT and mutant proteins to protect GS from oxidative damage induced by mixed function oxidation in the presence of thiol (DTT/Fe3+/O2) or nonthiol (ascorbate/Fe3+/O2) oxidation systems. As shown in Fig. 4B, the extent of GS protection increases in a saturable, dose-dependent manner in the presence of WT PHCC-TPx. In contrast, the C107S mutant protein is unable to protect GS regardless of the nature of the reducing equivalents (DTT or Trx), whereas the C136S and C155S mutants are fully active in the presence of DTT (Fig. 4B). The complete absence of GS protection by the C107S mutant strongly suggests that Cys107 is the primary site of attack by H2O2 yielding Cys107-SOH and H2O. In the presence of DTT and in the absence of either Cys136 or Cys155, Cys107-SOH may react with one of the DTT thiol groups to form a mixed disulfide bond, and the second DTT thiol group may attack this disulfide to produce the free thiol Cys107-SH and oxidized DTT. This may explain why the C136S and C155S mutants protect GS from oxidation by the DTT-containing mixed function oxidation system. When DTT is replaced with a non-thiol reducing equivalent such as ascorbate, PHCC-TPx no longer protects GS from oxidation, confirming that its antioxidant activity is tightly linked to a thiol-specific reducing group (data not shown). According to the catalytic model developed for several TPx isoforms (17.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), the proteins belonging to 1Cys- and 2Cys-TPx families formed monomer and dimers during H2O2 catalysis, which can be detected by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Because PHCC-TPx contains three conserved Cys residues, we investigated whether PHCC-TPx forms inter- or intramolecular disulfide bonds during the catalytic cycle and, if so, which Cys residues are involved in this bond formation. To test for dimer formation, we examined the electro-mobility of PHCC-TPx in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT by SDS-PAGE with yeast TPx1 as a control. In the absence of DTT, Cys residues of PHCC-TPx are expected to be oxidized by treatment at 95 °C for 5 min for SDS-PAGE analysis. As reported previously (16.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), yeast TPx1 forms dimers in non-reducing SDS-PAGE conditions, but PHCC-TPx is present at a molecular size corresponding to the monomeric form, regardless of the presence or absence of DTT (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that, unlike what is observed for 2Cys-TPx isoforms (16.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the PHCC-TPx might form intramolecular disulfide linkages upon oxidation. In the absence of DTT, two protein bands (the upper band is faint) can be observed for the PHCC-TPx protein (Fig. 5A), and most of the protein in the lower band shifts to the upper band after treatment with DTT. To analyze disulfide bonds in the protein, gel slices containing each band separated on SDS-PAGE without the presence of DTT were treated with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS. The data obtained are summarized in Fig. 5. Molecular masses equivalent to those of tryptic peptides of amino acids 107–123 (calculated m/z 1992.92 and observed m/z 1992.93) and of amino acids 126–151 (calculated m/z 2950.37 and observed m/z 2950.45) were clearly detected for both WT bands, indicating that a fraction of both Cys107 and Cys136 residues are present in a reduced state (SH form). On the contrary, the molecular mass corresponding to the free SH form of Cys155 (amino acids 153–157, with expected m/z 696.35) is not detected in the spectrum of peptides prepared from the lower band (Fig. 5, B1) but is clearly present in peptides from the upper minor band (m/z 696.35 in Fig. 5, B2). The absence of the mass peak corresponding to this peptide in the major band suggests that most Cys155residues may not be present in the reduced form but rather that they are linked to other Cys residues by disulfide bonds. If Cys155 forms a disulfide bond with Cys107, tryptic digestion will produce a dipeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 2545.20. Indeed, there is a strong peak with m/z2544.22, which is in good agreement with the expected value for this dipeptide (Fig. 5, B3). In addition, this peak is not detected in peptides derived from the C155S mutant (Fig. 5,B4), which confirms that the mass peak of m/z2544.22 represents the dipeptide created by the linkage of Cys155 and Cys107. Therefore, we conclude that there is an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys155and Cys107 in most of the proteins. Next, we examined the possibility of disulfide formation between Cys155 and Cys136. The molecular weight of the dipeptide formed by this linkage was calculated to be 3502.64. For the lower band of WT protein separated on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel, there is such a peak with m/z 3501.65 (Fig. 5, B5). Again, this peak is not observed in peptides derived from the C155S mutant (Fig. 5,B6), but the same peak with a stronger intensity is observed for the C107S mutant (Fig. 5, B7; note that the scales of intensity are different in two panels), suggesting that disulfide bond between Cys136 and Cys155 can be formed, and the formation is facilitated by the absence of Cys107. Taken together, we conclude that Cys155 forms a disulfide bond with both Cys107 and Cys136 in most of the individual enzymes and that the presence of Cys107 is not prerequisite for the formation of Cys136–Cys155 disulfide bond. Because Cys107 of PHCC-TPx is the primary oxidation site by H2O2 and C107S and C155S mutants completely lose the TPx activity (Fig. 4), it may be reasonable to conclude that Cys107–Cys155 is the primary disulfide bond formed during the catalytic cycle of H2O2reduction. It has been shown that the growth rate of GSH-deficient yeast mutants is significantly decreased when they are cultured in minimal medium and that they are hypersensitive to H2O2 (18.Ullmann P. Gondet L. Potier S. Bach T.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Also, the disruption of two yeast Trx genes, TRX1 and TRX2, results in pleiotropic effects that include H2O2 hypersensitivity (19.Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity of the two yeast mutants to oxidizing compounds may be accounted for by the fact that antioxidant enzymes in yeast mutants are not able to function in the absence of the electron donor of Trx or GSH. Thus, if the activity of PHCC-TPx is dependent on Trx in vivo, as suggested by the in vitro data, a plasmid overexpressing PHCC-TPx is expected to complement the phenotype of yeast mutants lacking GSH, but not Trx, because the GSH null mutant has normal level of Trx. To identify the actual in vivo electron donor required for the antioxidant function of PHCC-TPx, we introduced a yeast expression vector containing the PHCC-TPx gene under inducible control into mutants lacking GSH or Trx. Fig. 6 shows that both PHCC-TPx and yeast TPx1 restore the GSH-deficient mutants to WT levels of H2O2 tolerance but that yeast GPx3 cannot complement the H2O2 sensitivity of the GSH mutant. This result suggests that, like yeast TPx1, PHCC-TPx is functionally active in H2O2 removal in GSH-deficient mutant yeast, probably by virtue of the reducing power of Trx. In contrast, PHCC-TPx overexpression does not alleviate the H2O2 sensitivity of the Trx-null mutant but resistance is restored by yeast GPx3, indicating that the reducing power of GSH acts in conjunction with GPx3 but not with PHCC-TPx. These results clearly demonstrate that Trx, but not GSH, is responsible for the reduction of PHCC-TPx in vivo. We have shown both in vitro and in vivo that PHCC-TPx, which shares high sequence identity with plant PHGPx proteins, specifically uses Trx, but not GSH, in catalyzing the reduction of hydroperoxides. Considering the high amino acid sequence homologies among the PHGPx proteins, it can be proposed that most PHGPx proteins of plant sources would have similar substrate specificity on Trx. Like other TPx enzymes, PHCC-TPx uses redox-sensitive Cys residues in the process of H2O2 reduction, whereas most peroxidases use redox cofactors contained at their active sites (9.Holland D. Ben-Hayyim G. Faltin Z. Cmoin L. Strosberg D. Eshda Y. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although PHCC-TPx can be considered as a new TPx isoform, it is quite distantly related to other TPx families with less than 10% amino acid sequence identity. This low level of sequence homology is also observed among proteins belonging to other subfamilies of TPx proteins, although proteins in the same subfamily share high sequence similarity to one another (16.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). With respect to the number of conserved Cys residues and their catalytic processes, the six mammalian TPx isoforms fall largely into two subgroups. Each of the four members of the 2Cys-TPx subfamily (TPx isoforms I–IV) forms homodimers in which the two subunits are joined by an intermolecular disulfide bond, but the other two TPx isoforms, V–VI, are monomeric proteins. Thus, the PHCC-TPx can be classified into the latter group of TPx proteins, because it functions as a monomer during H2O2 reduction. Based on the data obtained in our experiments, a reaction process of PHCC-TPx-mediated reduction of peroxides can be proposed as follows, which is different from those reported for the mammalian 2Cys-TPx or SeCys-dependent GPx proteins (17.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). From the facts that C107S mutant is incapable of protecting GS activity with the help of any electron donor of DTT or Trx and that the activity of C136S and C155S mutants is similar to that of WT enzyme in the presence of DTT but not in Trx (Fig. 4), it can be concluded that Cys107 is the primary site attacked by H2O2 to produce H2O and Cys107-SOH. In contrast to the reaction intermediate of Cys47-SOH in yeast TPx1 which immediately reacts with Cys170-SH of the other subunit to form intermolecular disulfide bond (16.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the oxidized intermediate Cys107-SOH of PHCC-TPx forms intramolecular disulfide bond with Cys155-SH, which is reduced eventually by electrons donated from Trx and used for the next round of H2O2 catalysis. However, it is not clear whether the third Cys residue, Cys136, is involved in the catalytic reaction or not. The C136S mutant exhibits only 30% of peroxidase activity of the WT protein by using Trx as an electron donor (Fig. 4), suggesting it is important for the enzymatic activity. In addition, we could detect intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys136 and the one of the active site Cys residue (Cys155). Such observations tempted us to raise the possibility that in the catalytic process there may be disulfide bond exchange between three Cys residues, similar to that observed in the methionine sulfoxide reductase (30.Lowther W.T. Brot N. Weissbach H. Honek J.F. Matthews W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6463-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the third Cys residue was not absolutely required for the methionine sulfoxide reductase activity (30.Lowther W.T. Brot N. Weissbach H. Honek J.F. Matthews W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6463-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that, rather than direct involvement of Cys136 residue in the catalytic reaction, the reduced peroxidase activity of C136S might be attributable to a structural effect caused by the mutation. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of Cys136 in PHCC-TPx enzyme. It has been generally recognized that in mammalian cells GPx plays a major role in eliminating cytotoxic H2O2, because catalase, the strong antioxidant peroxisomal enzyme, has a low affinity for H2O2 (Km = 0.05∼1.1 × 103 mm) (31.Halliwell B. New Phytol. 1974; 73: 1075-1086Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, in plant systems, this role is assumed by APx proteins, which exist as several isoforms and are distributed in the cytosol, chloroplasts, and glyoxysomes. Based on the kinetic parameters of PHCC-TPx analyzed with a yeast Trx system in H2O2 reduction (Table I), we speculate that the high catalytic efficiency (Vm/Km) of PHCC-TPx for H2O2 reduction means that it is another strong candidate for the removal of hydroperoxides, especially in plant chloroplasts. To test this speculation, additional studies are required by using a plant-derived Trx system instead of yeast proteins to re-establish the kinetic parameters of the plant enzyme, PHCC-TPx, because the interaction between Trx and its electron acceptor often represents species-specific (32.Mora-Garcia S. Rodriguez-Suarez R. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16273-16280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and isoform-specific properties (33.Schwarz O. Schurmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16924-16927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The defensive role of PHCC-TPx in plant cells can also be surmised from observations that its homologues are induced to remarkable levels by various stress treatments, such as the exposure of tobacco protoplasts to high salt, soybean to bacterial infection, and Avena fatua embryos to imbibition (9.Holland D. Ben-Hayyim G. Faltin Z. Cmoin L. Strosberg D. Eshda Y. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, diverse roles of plant PHGPx proteins can be proposed by the differential expression of PHGPx isozymes in barley (8.Churin Y. Schilling S. Borner T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); the expression of barley PHGPx1 and -2 is greatly increased in leaves exposed to stress, but the PHGPx3 mRNA is down-regulated in response to the same stress. Furthermore, a possible involvement of PHGPx in signal transduction pathways may be suggested by studies of the mitochondrial PHGPx, which functions as an anti-apoptotic agent in mitochondrial death signaling (34.Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Arai M. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29294-29302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In summary, although the exact function of the new isoform of plant TPx remains to be determined, our identification of Trx as the reducing agent of PHCC-TPx will greatly help us in the future to study the role of this novel enzyme in plant cells.

The biogenesis of mitochondria requires delivery of several hundred gene products to their specific locations within the organelle. A small number of mostly hydrophobic proteins is encoded on the mitochondrial genome, whereas the great majority of mitochondrial proteins is encoded in the nucleus and synthesized in the cytosol. A series of protein translocation machineries is required for the import and sorting of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins to their individual destinations. Three of these translocases facilitate protein import from the cytosol into mitochondria: the TOM complex (translocase of the outer membrane) in the outer membrane and two inner membrane TIM complexes (translocases of the innermembrane) which have differential substrate specificity (1.Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 2.Herrmann J. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 3.Rehling P. Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Truscott K.N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A fourth translocase mediates the insertion of its substrates from the mitochondrial matrix into the inner membrane. Since the direction of translocation is opposite that of the other three translocases, the process is referred to as mitochondrial protein export. The export machinery is referred to as the OXA translocase since the only component identified thus far is the Oxa1 protein. Oxa1 was originally shown to be required for the formation of cytochrome coxidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol.

Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In yeast, the OXA translocase has now been shown to facilitate the insertion of several nuclear-encoded, matrix-targeted proteins and most, if not all, mitochondrially synthesized membrane proteins into the inner membrane (6.He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

The OXA translocase has been well conserved through evolution and homologues of Oxa1 are present in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria of various organisms (4.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P.

A knockout mutant of the S. cerevisiae OXA1 gene is viable, but mutants are unable to respire and grow only on fermentable carbon sources (4.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Schizosaccharomyes pombe contains two genes encoding distinct Oxa1 proteins. Both are able to complement S. cerevisiae Oxa1 deficiency. Inactivation of both oxa1genes in S. pombe is lethal to this petite negative yeast (13.Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Groudinsky O. Dujardin G. Mol. Micro. 2000; 35: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli homologue, YidC, is an essential component of the bacterial protein export machinery (11.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 14.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To date, work on Oxa1 has concentrated on its genetics, function, and identification of substrates. The yeast Oxa1 contains five transmembrane domains with the N terminus of the protein residing in the intermembrane space and the C terminus in the matrix (15.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons suggest that this topology is highly conserved among Oxa1 family members, but little else is known about the structure of the OXA translocase. The E. coli YidC protein was reported to be at least partially associated with the Sec translocase (14.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, there is no homologue of the Sec machinery in mitochondria of yeast (16.Glick B.S. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2651-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or other organisms with completely sequenced genomes. It is unknown whether Oxa1 is associated with other components. In this report we describe the characteristics of an N. crassa oxa1mutant and show that a homooligomeric Oxa1 complex can be purified from mitochondria following lysis with non-ionic detergents. Growth and handling of N. crassa were as described (17.Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The N. crassastrains used in this study are listed in Table I. S. cerevisiae strains were isogenic to the wild type strain W303a and were cultivated at 30 °C on YP medium supplemented with 2% glucose, or 2% galactose, and 0.5% KOH-buffered lactate (18.Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 538-544Google Scholar). In the Δoxa1 yeast strain the complete OXA1 reading frame was replaced by the HIS3 gene (8.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The plasmid TPI-oxa1Nc, containing the coding sequence for N. crassa Oxa1, was transformed into this mutant resulting in strain Δoxa1 (oxa1Nc).Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotype1-aThe cyh-2 allele confers resistance to cycloheximide.OriginHVa cyh-2 lys-2 leu-5 mei-2FGSC number 7255MVA am132 inl inv mei-2FGSC number 7265OXB80–1As HV, but carries an ectopic copy of oxa1.Transformation of HV with plasmid Bleomycin resistant.XAB1–5OX80–7-1Sheltered heterokaryon:Cross of MV × OXB80–1 (cyh-2 lys-2 leu-5 mei-2 oxa1RIP + am132 inl inv mei-2), mating type unknown.

Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence of the S. cerevisiae Oxa1 protein (4.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was used to identify a N. crassa homologue in a BLAST search of the University of Oklahoma N. crassa EST (expressed sequence tag) data bases. PCR primers were designed from the sequence of the EST and used to synthesize a N. crassa oxa1-specific probe. A cosmid library (19.Gessert S.F. Kim J.H. Nargang F.E. Weiss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8189-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was screened and several positive clones were identified. Cosmid 31-2 was chosen for further work. Plasmid XAB1–5 was constructed by cloning a 2.1-kb PCR-generated fragment containing the oxa1 gene and a 1.6-kb fragment encoding a bleomycin resistance gene from pAB520 (20.Austin B. Hall R.M. Tyler B.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively, of pBR325. This plasmid was used to transform strain HV of N. crassa to generate a duplication to serve as a RIP (repeat induced point mutation) substrate for oxa1. RIP is a natural phenomenon that occurs during the sexual phase of the N. crassa life cycle. Duplications present in the genome are detected and rendered non-functional by the generation of GC to AT transitions in both copies of the sequence (21.Selker E.U. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 579-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSSOX-4 carries an oxa1-containing 5.5-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment, derived from cosmid 31-2, cloned into pBSSKII. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain CJ236 for the generation of single-stranded DNA for site-directed mutagenesis. This single-stranded DNA was utilized to create plasmids pJ295-3 and pJ306-2 which contain mutations that generate stop codons at the positions corresponding to amino acid residues 352 and 247 of the preprotein coding sequence, respectively. A hygromycin resistance gene from pCSN44 (22.Staben C. Jensen B. Singer M. Pollock J. Schechtman M. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1989; 36: 79-81Google Scholar) was inserted into each plasmid to give pH295-3-8 and pH306-2-12. Plasmid pK5B-10 is a pBSSKII derivative containing the oxa1coding sequence plus six histidine codons. The histidine tag was generated by PCR using a 3′ primer that contained the coding region of the C terminus of oxa1 with six His codons inserted before the stop codon. The 5′ primer corresponded to a oxa1-specific sequence upstream of an AvrII site situated 237 base pairs upstream of the stop codon. The PCR fragment was polished with T4 DNA polymerase, cut with AvrII, and ligated into a bleomycin resistant containing derivative of pSSOX-4 that had been cut with KpnI, polished with T4 DNA polymerase, and then cut with AvrII. This released the C-terminal coding region of the oxa1 gene as well as the 3′-flanking sequence. Thus, the PCR product containing the histidine tag replaced the normal C terminus and flanking region of the oxa1 gene. Plasmid TPI-oxa1Ncwas constructed for transformation of yeast Δoxa1 strain and contained an intron-less version of the N. crassa oxa1gene subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the plasmid pYX142 (Novagen, Madison, WI) which allows expression of N. crassa oxa1 in yeast under control of the constitutive triose-phosphate isomerase promoter. The oxa1 gene was inactivated by the process of RIP (21.Selker E.U. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 579-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Because we suspected that null mutants of oxa1 would be inviable in N. crassa, we utilized sheltered RIP to obtain heterokaryotic strains in which one nucleus contained no functional oxa1 alleles. Sheltered RIP requires knowledge of the chromosome that carries the target gene. RFLP mapping studies (23.Metzenberg R. Stevens J. Selker E. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Neurospora Newsl. 1984; 31: 35-39Google Scholar, 24.Metzenberg R. Stevens J. Selker E. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25.Metzenberg R. Grotelueschen J. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1992; 39: 50-58Google Scholar), using cosmid 31-2 as a probe, showed that the N. crassa oxa1 gene was located on chromosome V. The principles, strains, and procedures of sheltered RIP for chromosome V have been described (26.Metzenberg R.L. Grotelueschen J.S. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1992; 39: 37-49Google Scholar) and are analogous to those used previously to inactivate the tom20 gene on linkage group IV (27.Harkness T.A.A. Metzenberg R.L. Schneider H. Lill R. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Genetics. 1994; 136: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sheltered RIP Host V strain was transformed with plasmid pXAB1-5 to generate a duplication of oxa1 to create the RIP substrate. Transformants were selected on bleomycin containing medium, taken through one round of purification on bleomycin containing plates, and examined by Southern analysis for evidence of ectopic integration of a single copy of oxa1. Strain OXB80-1 was chosen to act as the male parent in a cross to the Mate V strain. The duplication of oxa1 in OXB80-1 stimulated RIP of both copies of the duplication during the sexual cycle. The desired ascospores produced from this cross were disomic for linkage group V and were selected by growth on minimal medium. Upon vegetative growth, the disomic ascospores break down into heterokaryons containing two different nuclei. The potential lethality caused by the inability of the nucleus containing the oxa1RIP gene to make functional Oxa1 is sheltered, or complemented, by a nucleus containing an oxa1+ gene. The nuclei may also contain the introduced ectopic copy of oxa1 depending on its segregation through meiosis. To screen for heterokaryons containing both wild type and RIPed oxa1 sequences, genomic DNA was prepared from each isolate and used in PCR reactions with oxa1-specific primers. The PCR products were sequenced directly and two strains, OX80-7-1 and OX80-15-1, gave mixed sequence with evidence of the GC to AT transitions characteristic of RIP. Strain OX80-15-1 was chosen for further analysis. Cloning and sequence analysis of oxa1sequences from this strain revealed that the RIP nucleus contained both the endogenous and ectopic alleles of oxa1. Both contained multiple RIP mutations including an identical mutation which generates stop codons at position 137 of the 462-amino acid coding sequences. We consider these to be effectively null alleles since the proteins encoded would be terminated before the first predicted membrane spanning domain. Antisera were raised against a fusion protein comprising glutathione S-transferase and the C terminus of N. crassa Oxa1. For expression of this protein in E. coli, the sequence encoding amino acid residues 345 to 462 of the Oxa1 preprotein was amplified by PCR using the primers HH13 (5′-GGGAGATCTCACCTTCCCGCCTTCCGC) and HH14 (5′-GGGGGATCCCATCTGTAATTCATATCCC). The PCR product was digested with BamHI/BglII, and subcloned into the BamHI site of the E. coli expression vector pETGEXCT (28.Sharrocks A.D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The antisera used against yeast Oxa1 and Cox2 were described previously (15.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Antiserum against purified N. crassa complex I and a sample of purified complex I, used as a control for the specificity of the antiserum, were generously provided by Ulrich Schulte and Hans Weiss, Düsseldorf, Germany. To facilitate isolation of Oxa1, we developed strain K5-15-23-1 (Table I). The strain was obtained by chromosomal insertion of a modified oxa1 gene, encoding a C-terminal hexahistidinyl-tagged version of the protein, into the oxa1RIP nucleus of heterokaryon OX80-15-1. The resulting strain is a lysine-leucine-requiring homokaryon that expresses exclusively a His-tagged version of Oxa1 at wild type levels. Mitochondria from strain K5-15-23-1 were dissolved in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, plant protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and either 1% dodecyl maltoside or 1% Triton X-100) at a concentration of 1 mg of mitochondrial protein per ml of buffer. After gentle mixing for 30 min at 4 °C, the sample was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 2 °C. The cleared lysate was diluted with 4 volumes of lysis buffer, without the protease inhibitor mixture, and mixed gently for 60 min with Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The slurry was poured into a column, washed with lysis buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, and eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The protein was further purified by binding the Ni-NTA column eluate to SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% dodecyl maltoside or 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The column was washed with binding buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted with binding buffer containing either 350 or 500 mm NaCl. Size exclusion chromatography was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% detergent, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using either a Superose 6 (10/30) column (Amersham Biosciences AB) in a Pharmacia Äkta explorer chromatography unit or Superose 6 (16/50) and Superose 12 (10/30) columns arranged in series in a Pharmacia LCC500 chromatography unit. Identical sizes were obtained for the Oxa1 complex, analyzed relative to molecular weight calibration standards, under both separation conditions. Western blots (29.Good A.G. Crosby W.L.

FEBS Lett. 1973; 35: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were according to published procedures. Site-directed mutagenesis was done with the Muta-gene system from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Mitochondria were isolated as previously described for yeast (18.Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 538-544Google Scholar) and N. crassa (35.Pfanner N. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An N. crassa EST for oxa1 was identified in a BLAST search using the sequence of the S. cerevisiae Oxa1 protein as the query. Primers designed from the EST sequence were used to generate PCR products to probe a cosmid library of N. crassa. The oxa1 gene sequence was determined from a single cosmid and has been deposited in the NCBI data base (accession number AF435863). A BLAST search of the N. crassa genome sequence revealed no oxa1 paralogues. The amino acid sequence of the N. crassa Oxa1 protein is shown in Fig. 1A, aligned with its Homo sapiens and S. cerevisiae orthologues. The sequence of the mature N. crassa protein is 22% identical to both the predicted mature yeast and human homologues. Despite this low level of identity, the overall structure of the proteins is very similar. All three Oxa1 proteins are comprised of a well conserved core region of about 200 amino acid residues that contains five transmembrane domains with highly conserved lengths and spacing. This core region is flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions which contain little sequence identity. However, a high probability for coiled coil structure formation is predicted in the C-terminal matrix domain of all homologues (Fig. 1B). Previously described mutants of the S. cerevisiae oxa1 gene were found to exhibit a petite phenotype (4.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). An Oxa1 null mutant in N. crassa was created by the procedure of sheltered RIP to give a heterokaryon in which one nucleus contains a functional version of oxa1, while the other does not (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis demonstrated that the oxa1 alleles present in the RIPed nucleus were effectively null alleles (see “Experimental Procedures”). Macroconidia (conidia), the asexual spores formed by N. crassa for propagation, typically contain between one and five nuclei. When the sheltered heterokaryon produces conidia, the two nuclear types should be distributed randomly giving rise to three types of conidia: nucleus 1 homokaryons, nucleus 2 homokaryons, and heterokaryotic conidia containing both nuclei. To determine whether conidia containing only nucleus 1 were viable, conidia formed from the sheltered heterokaryon were streaked onto media containing lysine, leucine, and inositol to obtain single colonies. As shown in Table II, analysis of these colonies revealed no lysine-, leucine-requiring homokaryons, whereas both inositol-requiring homokaryons and heterokaryotic colonies were identified. In contrast, lysine and leucine auxotrophs could be isolated following transformation of the sheltered heterokaryon with plasmid pK5B-10, encoding the hexahistidinyl-tagged version of Oxa1. Taken together, these data indicate that Oxa1 is essential for viability in Neurospora. This agrees with the observation that S. pombe strains lacking both of their Oxa1 isoforms were also inviable (13.Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Groudinsky O. Dujardin G. Mol. Micro. 2000; 35: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Table IIInability to isolate homokaryons carrying the oxa1RIP alleleStrainColonies examinedInositol requiring homokaryonsLysine and leucine requiring homokaryonsHeterokaryonsOX80–7-19426068OX80–15-1182560126 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate directly that Oxa1 is required for growth, the sheltered RIP strain was propagated in the presence of cycloheximide to increase the ratio of nuclei containing the non-functional oxa1RIP allele relative to nuclei containing the wild type allele (Fig. 2). This caused an almost complete growth arrest of the culture, whereas the cycloheximide-resistant control strain grew only slightly slower than cells in inhibitor free medium (Fig. 3A). Western blotting revealed that growth in increasing concentrations of cycloheximide resulted in reduced Oxa1 levels in the sheltered heterokaryon whereas no detectable changes occurred in control strains grown under similar conditions (Fig. 3B). The level of Oxa1 in the sheltered heterokaryon grown in minimal medium without cycloheximide also appeared to be somewhat lower than in control strains probably because nucleus 1 supplied no Oxa1. This minor reduction in Oxa1 content had no apparent effect on the growth rate of the cells (Fig. 3A). Similar levels of the mitochondrial proteins Hsp70, Tom40, and Tom22 were found in all strains regardless of the growth condition (Fig. 3B). We constructed an expression plasmid for yeast carrying the N. crassa oxa1 gene under the control of the yeast TPI1promoter. When transformed into cells of a yeast strain carrying an oxa1 deletion, the N. crassa gene rescued the growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources (Fig. 4A). In yeast, Oxa1 is required for the insertion and processing of Cox2 into the inner membrane. In the absence of Oxa1, the precursor of Cox2 does not leave the matrix and is rapidly degraded so that no Cox2 can be detected upon Western blotting of Δoxa1 mitochondria (6.He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 7.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from yeast cells expressing N. crassa Oxa1 contain wild type amounts of mature Cox2 indicating that the N. crassa protein is able to functionally replace yeast Oxa1 (Fig. 4B). These data show that the function of Oxa1 proteins is highly conserved and that we have isolated the functional homologue of yeast Oxa1. This suggests that the N. crassa protein, like its yeast homologue, is a central component of the machinery for the insertion of proteins into the inner membrane of mitochondria. We determined if depletion of Oxa1 in N. crassa cells affected the levels of subunits of respiratory chain complexes by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5 the levels of both Cox2 and Cox3 of complex IV were significantly reduced in Oxa1-deficient N. crassa mitochondria. Unlike yeast, N. crassa contains a bona fide complex I of the electron transport chain. Immunoblots of Oxa1-deficient mitochondria with antiserum raised against holocomplex I revealed significantly reduced levels of the 24- and 29.9-kDa subunits of Complex I (Fig. 5). This is the first demonstration that the function of the Oxa1 protein is required for the biogenesis of complex I. Since a number of complex I subunits are mitochondrially encoded in N. crassa, it seems likely that the membrane insertion of at least some of them requires the OXA translocase. Oxa1 contains five transmembrane domains and a large C-terminal tail that is localized in the mitochondrial matrix (15.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As discussed above, computer predictions strongly suggested the existence of a coiled coil structure in the C-terminal matrix domain (Fig. 1B). To determine whether this domain plays a critical role in Oxa1 function, we constructed a mutant version of Oxa1 that lacks the last 110 residues of the protein where the predicted coiled coil domain resides (Fig. 6A). This variant was transformed into the sheltered heterokaryon and selection for strains in which the truncated variant had rescued the oxa1RIP nucleus (Fig. 2) was imposed. Mitochondria isolated from the rescued homokaryotic strains contained no detectable Oxa1 (Fig. 6B) since our antibody was raised against the C-terminal 117 residues of the protein which are missing in the truncated form. No full-length Oxa1 is present because the rescued strains are homokaryons containing only the oxa1RIP nucleus. Thus, the fact that the cells are viable provides evidence that the truncated form of the protein is present and functional in these rescued strains. Growth rates of the isolates containing the variant were indistinguishable from control strains (Fig. 6C). In contrast, an Oxa1 variant containing only the N-terminal 246 residues of the 462 residue preprotein, did not rescue the oxa1RIP nucleus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the predicted coiled coil domain found in the C terminus of the N. crassa Oxa1 protein, is not essential for Oxa1 function. The yeast Oxa1 protein was reported to be part of a high molecular weight complex of unknown composition (8.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To study the complex further we wished to isolate it from N. crassa mitochondria. To enhance the purification procedure, we constructed strain K5-15-23-1, which expresses exclusively a hexahistidinyl-tagged version of Oxa1.

However, the biological functions and enzymology of p68 RNA helicase are not well characterized. We report the expression and purification of recombinant p68 RNA helicase in a bacterial system. The recombinant p68 is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase. ATPase assays demonstrated that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is much more effective than single-stranded RNA in stimulating ATP hydrolysis by the recombinant protein. Consistently, RNA-binding assays showed that p68 RNA helicase binds single-stranded RNA weakly in an ATP-dependent manner. On the other hand, the recombinant protein has very high affinity for dsRNA. Binding of the protein to dsRNA is ATP-independent. The data indicate that p68 may directly target dsRNA as its natural substrate. Interestingly, the recombinant p68 RNA helicase unwinds dsRNA in both 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ directions. This is the second example of a Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) box RNA helicase that unwinds RNA duplexes in a bi-directional manner. p68 RNA helicase, a nuclear RNA helicase, was identified 2 decades ago.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe “p68”-Dbp2p share 55% identity with the human protein (6.Iggo R.D. Jamieson D.J. MacNeill S.A. Southgate J. McPheat J. Lane D.P. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that the biological functions of the p68 RNA helicase are conserved among different species. The p68 RNA helicase belongs to a large family of highly evolutionarily conserved proteins, the so-called Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)1 box family of putative ATPases and helicases (for reviews see Refs. 8.Luking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar and 9.Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The RNA helicases are found in almost all organisms, from bacteria to human. This family of proteins is involved in almost every process of RNA metabolism in cells such as pre-mRNA splicing, translation, RNA degradation, and ribosome biogenesis (10.de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). RNA helicases are enzymes that catalyze the separation of strands of duplex RNA by utilization of the energy derived from hydrolysis of NTP (generally ATP). Unlike the previously defined DNA helicase, which processively unwinds long stretches of dsDNA, most RNA helicases probably modulate only a short duplex region in a long RNA molecule. In addition, recent studies also suggest that members of DEAD/DE xH superfamily of RNA helicase may also be involved in dissociation of protein-RNA interactions (11.Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S.

Despite a rapidly growing number of identified putative RNA helicases, only a handful of these putative RNA helicases, including eIF-4A, U5–200K, HCV-NS3, Brr2p, Prp16p, and vaccinia virus NPH-II, have demonstrated RNA unwinding activity in vitro (14.Rozen F.

ATPase activity of the purified p68 RNA helicase is stimulated by RNA polynucleotides and to a lesser extent by DNAs. The RNA unwinding assay showed that the p68 RNA helicase was able to unwind a partial dsRNA with a long 162-bp duplex (15.Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This indicated that p68 RNA helicase unwinds RNA with high processivity. In addition to unwinding RNA, p68 RNA helicase was also suggested to catalyze RNA annealing (13.Rossler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty in expression and purification of recombinant p68 RNA helicase in an appropriate expression system, the biological functions and enzymatic activities of p68 RNA helicase are not well characterized (10.de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 22.Heinlein U.A. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 345-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using a unique methylene blue-mediated cross-linking technique (MB cross-linking) (23.Liu Z.R. Wilkie A.M. Clemens M.J. Smith C.W. RNA (New York). 1996; 2: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar), p68 RNA helicase was detected interacting with the U1:5′-ss duplex during the splicing process (24.Liu Z.R. Sargueil B. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6910-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The protein is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. 2Z.-R. Liu, unpublished results. In this article, we report the expression and purification of recombinant His tag p68 RNA helicase from Escherichia coli. We analyzed the ATPase and RNA unwinding activities of the recombinant His tag p68. Our data show that the ATPase activity of the protein was polynucleotide-dependent. dsRNA is much more efficient than ssRNA in stimulating the ATPase activity of the protein. We demonstrate here that p68 RNA helicase unwound RNA in both 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ directions. In addition, our data demonstrate that p68 RNA helicase bound strongly to dsRNA, and the binding was ATP-independent. RNAs were synthesized by run-off transcriptions of the linearized transcription vectors that carry appropriate DNA inserts in the transcription region using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. The RNAs were uniformed labeled with [α-32P]UTP. The DNA vectors for transcribing each RNA substrate are listed in Table I. The partial dsRNAs were prepared by annealing each pair of complementary transcripts at a 3-fold excess of unlabeled strand over labeled strand. The dsRNA substrate for both ATPase assays and RNA binding assays is the hybridization of equal molar amounts of two complementary strands. Annealing solution contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 80% formamide. The RNA annealing mixture was heated to 85 °C for 10 min and was then slowly cooled down to room temperature. The RNA hybrids were used without further treatments.Table ITranscripts used in ATPase, RNA unwinding, and RNA-binding assaysRNALengthRNA polymeraseVectorModificationsDigestionnt1167SP6pGEM-3ZDelete the sequence between EcoRI/HindIIIPvuII2222T7pGEM-3ZDelete the sequence between EcoRI/HindIIIPvuII3214SP6pGEM-3ZNOPvuII4269T7pGEM-3ZNOPvuII528SP6pSP73NOEcoRI693T7pSP73NOBglII758SP6pGEM-3ZDelete the sequence GAGTATT between the SP6 starting site and HindIII siteEcoRI861T7pGEM-3ZNOHindIII9297SP6pGEM-3ZNONdeI Open table in a new tab According to the GenBankTM sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF015812), a pair of primers, 5′GCGGATCCTCGAGTGACCGAGACCGC3′ and 5′ATTGGGAATATCCTGTTG3′, was used. The open reading frame (ORF) that encodes p68 RNA helicase was amplified from a cDNA library (Stratagene). The PCR products were cloned into pBluescript SK(+) vector. The obtained DNA clones were examined by auto-DNA sequencing, and the sequences of resultant DNA completely match the DNA sequences of p68 RNA helicase retrieved from GenBankTM. The ORF of p68 RNA helicase was subcloned into an expression vector pET-30a by BamHI/HindIII sites. The expression clones were transformed to E. coli. Bacteria were grown in LB medium to A600 nm = 0.6. The expression of recombinant protein was induced by IPTG for 5 h. To purify the recombinant protein, the harvested bacterial cells were subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle at −80 °C. After digestion with lysozyme in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmEDTA) at 30 °C for 40 min, the bacterial cells were further disrupted by ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the soluble bacterial lysates were passed through a Ni-NTA column, and the recombinant proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole in protein buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). The protein was further dialyzed against the same buffer with only 100 mmimidazole. ATPase activities were determined by measuring the released inorganic phosphate during ATP hydrolysis using a direct colorimetric assay (25.Chan K.-M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 26.Pugh G.E. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The method is based on the change in absorbance (A623 nm) of malachite green-molybdenum complex in the presence and absence of inorganic phosphate. A typical ATPase assay was carried out in 50-μl reaction volumes, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, ∼1–2 μg of appropriate RNA, 40 units of RNasin, 4 mm NTP, and 10 μl of helicase. The ATPase reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, 1 ml of malachite green-molybdenum reagent was added to the reaction mixture, and reactions were further incubated at room temperature for exactly 5 min. The absorption (A) at 630 nm was then measured. The concentrations of inorganic phosphate were determined by matching the A630 nm in a standard curve of A630 nmversus known phosphate concentrations. RNA unwinding activities were determined by the method similar to that described by Rozen and co-workers (14.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Briefly, the RNA unwinding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 2.5 fmol of partial dsRNA, 40 units of RNasin, 16 mm ATP, and 2–4 μl of helicase. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixtures were directly loaded onto the appropriate percentage of SDS-PAGE, and the gel was subjected to autoradiography. RNA bindings were analyzed by gel-mobility shift assays and MB-mediated dsRNA-protein cross-linking (23.Liu Z.R. Wilkie A.M. Clemens M.J. Smith C.W. RNA (New York). 1996; 2: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Liu Z.R. Laggerbauer B. Luhrmann R. Smith C.W. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 1207-1219PubMed Google Scholar). In a typical gel mobility shift assay, 100 ng of recombinant proteins were mixed with 5 fmol of appropriate RNA in buffer solution containing 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 units of RNasin with or without ATP as indicated. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixtures were loaded on to 6% native-PAGE (acrylamide:bis = 40:1). The methylene blue mediated cross-linkings were carried out as described previously (23.Liu Z.R. Wilkie A.M. Clemens M.J. Smith C.W. RNA (New York). 1996; 2: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Liu Z.R. Sargueil B. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6910-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The same protein:RNA reaction mixtures used in the gel mobility shift assays were used in the cross-linking experiments. After RNase mixture (RNase A, T1, and V1) digestion, the cross-linking mixture was separated by the appropriate percentage of SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. The Western blot analyses were performed with various sources of bacterial lysates, the purified recombinant p68, and the recombinant HCV-NS3 using the commercial ECL Western blot and detection kits. The antibody pAb204 was used in the blot as a 5:1 dilution and pAbN1 was used as a 3000:1 dilution. Previous data demonstrated that p68 RNA helicase is an essential splicing factor acting at the U1 small nuclear RNA and 5′-splice site duplex (24.Liu Z.R. Sargueil B. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6910-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).2 According to the cDNA sequence of human p68 RNA helicase from GenBankTM(accession number AF015812), the open reading frame (ORF) of p68 RNA helicase was cloned, and the recombinant His tag protein was overexpressed in E. coli (BL21) and purified over a Ni-NTA column (Fig. 1A, lane 5). The concentration of the recombinant protein was estimated to be about 250 ng/μl (estimated by Bradford method, Bio-Rad). We noted that to keep the recombinant protein in a soluble form, it is necessary to maintain the protein in a buffer solution containing at least 100 mmimidazole (data not shown). To verify whether the obtained recombinant protein is p68 RNA helicase, we performed Western blot analyses using a monoclonal antibody pAb204 and a polyclonal antibody pAbN1 (raised against a peptide that spans 15 amino acids residues at the N-terminal region of human p68). It is evident that the purified recombinant protein was recognized by both antibodies in the Western blot analyses (Fig. 1, B, lane 1, and C,lane 1). No bacterial proteins were recognized by these two antibodies (Fig. 1, B, lane 3, and C, lane 3). The data suggested that a soluble recombinant His tag p68 RNA helicase was expressed and purified in a bacterial expression system. To determine enzymatic activities of the bacterially expressed recombinant p68 RNA helicase, we first examined the ATPase activity of the His-p68 by measuring the released inorganic phosphate during ATP hydrolysis using a direct colorimetric assay (25.Chan K.-M. Delfert D. Junger K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 26.Pugh G.E. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ATPase assays demonstrated that the recombinant protein hydrolyzed ATP in a polynucleotide-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). As a control, no ATP hydrolysis was observed in the same assay using BSA (Fig. 2A). We also tested the acceptance of other nucleotide triphosphates by the recombinant p68. Our experiments showed that the protein only hydrolyzed ATP and dATP but not CTP, UTP, and GTP (data not shown). To examine the nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity of the bacterially expressed recombinant p68 RNA helicase, we carried out ATPase assays in the presence of ssRNA (RNA 9, Table I), ssDNA (DNA oligonucleotides, 24 nt), dsRNA (RNA 7 versus RNA 8, Table I), or dsDNA (pGEM-3Z, linearized with EcoRI). Consistent with previous analyses (20.Iggo R.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) carried out with p68 purified from human 239 cells, the ATPase activity of the bacterially expressed p68 RNA helicase was activated by both the ssRNA and the dsDNA and to much less extent by the ssDNA (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the ATPase activity of the recombinant protein was greatly enhanced by the dsRNA. The ATPase activity of the protein was more than doubled in the presence of the dsRNA compared with that in the presence of the same molar amounts of the ssRNA (Fig. 2B). Because doubling the amounts of each individual ssRNA that formed the duplex RNA did not have a similar effect on the ATPase activity of p68 (data not shown), it was less likely that the enhancement of the ATPase activity by the dsRNA was the result of the residues of ssRNAs that did not form duplex in our annealing conditions. The dsRNA used in our test contains a 67-bp duplex, a 4-nt 5′-overhang on one side, and an 1-nt 5′-overhang on the other side (Table I). It is unlikely that the very short ssRNA tails on both sides of the RNA duplex are responsible for the ATPase activity enhancement. Thus our conclusion is that the ATPase activity of the recombinant p68 RNA helicase is strongly stimulated by dsRNA. The preceding data showed that the ATPase activity of the recombinant p68 was strongly enhanced by dsRNA. We reasoned that the recombinant p68 RNA helicase may bind dsRNA, and the affinity of the protein for dsRNA may be higher than that for ssRNA. To measure the RNA-binding properties of the recombinant p68 RNA helicase, we employed the gel mobility shift assay. The same ssRNA and dsRNA substrates used in the ATPase assays were utilized here to examine the ssRNA and dsRNA binding activities of the recombinant p68 RNA helicase. A weak mobility-shifted band was observed with the recombinant p68 RNA helicase and the ssRNA (Fig. 3A, lane 2), and the shifted band was ATP-dependent (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 to lane 4). A similar ssRNA binding property was also observed with another RNA helicase derived from NS3 of HCV (Fig. 3A, lane 3). However, a very strong mobility-shifted band was observed with the recombinant p68 RNA helicase and the dsRNA substrate, and the formation of this slow mobility RNA-protein complex band is ATP-independent (Fig. 3A, lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, no mobility shift band was observed with the HCV-NS3 RNA helicase and the same dsRNA substrate (Fig. 3A, lane 6). Quantitative analyses of both the free RNA bands and RNA-protein complex bands indicate that less than 10% of the ssRNA was associated with the ssRNA-p68 complex. On the other hand, more than 90% of the labeled dsRNA was associated with the shifted dsRNA-protein complex band. The data suggested that the recombinant p68 has higher affinity for dsRNA compared with that for ssRNA. To verify further the dsRNA binding by the recombinant p68 RNA helicase, we utilized the MB cross-linking technique, an RNA-protein photocross-linking method that has high preference for mediating cross-links between dsRNA and dsRNA-binding proteins (23.Liu Z.R. Wilkie A.M. Clemens M.J. Smith C.W. RNA (New York). 1996; 2: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar). The same ssRNA and dsRNA substrates used in gel mobility shift assays were used in the MB cross-linking tests. It is evident that the recombinant p68 RNA helicase was cross-linked to the dsRNA target in an ATP-independent manner (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). The cross-linking signal was not observed with the ssRNA:p68 or with HCV-NS3:dsRNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). The results from the cross-linking experiments were completely consistent with the data obtained from gel mobility shift assays. Our experimental data strongly suggested that the recombinant p68 RNA helicase has high affinity for dsRNA compared with that for ssRNA. This dsRNA binding property is not a common characteristic to all members of DEAD box family of RNA helicases. To examine the RNA unwinding activities of the recombinant His tag p68, we carried out an RNA unwinding assay using a procedure similar to that described by Rozen and co-workers (14.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The RNA substrate for the RNA unwinding assay was a partial dsRNA containing a short RNA duplex (∼22 bp in length) and long 186- and 88-nt 3′-overhangs on both sides (RNA 1 versusRNA 2, Table I and Fig. 4). Consistent with previous studies (13.Rossler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15.Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the partial dsRNA-containing 3′-overhang was unwound in the presence of 25 ng/μl of the His tag p68 (Fig. 4A, lane 4). In the control reactions, the unwinding was not observed in the absence of ATP and in the absence of the recombinant protein (lanes 3 and 5). The RNA duplex was also not unwound by a nonspecific protein, BSA (lane 6). The p68 RNA helicase purified from human 239 cells was able to unwind a partial dsRNA with a long 162-bp RNA duplex (15.Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This feature is unique to very few members of DEAD/DE xH RNA helicases. It is generally believed that, unlike DNA helicases, the majority of so-called RNA helicases work only on a short stretch of RNA duplex or local RNA structures (8.Luking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). NPH-II from vaccinia virus is another example of unwinding long RNA duplex (28.Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To test whether the bacterially expressed p68 RNA helicase is able to unwind the long RNA duplex, we employed another partial dsRNA substrate in the unwinding assays. The partial dsRNA contains a 69-bp duplex and a 186-nt 3′-overhang on one side and a 88-nt 3′-overhang on the other side (RNA 3 versus RNA 4, Table I and Fig. 4). In contrast to the observations made by Hirling and co-workers (15.Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), our unwinding experiments showed that very small fractions of the partial dsRNA substrate were unwound by the recombinant p68 (Fig. 4B, lane 8). Our observations are, however, consistent with observations made by Rossler and co-workers (13.Rossler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The above unwinding data indicated that the recombinant p68 is a weak processive RNA helicase. A member of the DEAD box family, translational initiation factor eIF-4A has been shown to unwind RNA duplex in both 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ directions. It was suggested that this unwinding property of the protein helps the melting of the mRNA structure during the translational initiation process (14.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 29.Jaramillo M. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30.Pause A. Sonenberg N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 953-959Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate the polarity of RNA unwinding by the p68 RNA helicase, we synthesized a partial dsRNA containing a 22-bp duplex and a 71-nt 5′-overhang on the one side and a 6-nt 5′-overhang on the other side (RNA 5versus RNA 6, Table I and Fig. 4). The RNA unwinding assay was carried out with this RNA substrate. In contrast to the observations made by Rossler and co-workers (13.Rossler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we have repeatedly observed that this partial dsRNA with the 5′-overhang was completely unwound by the bacterially expressed p68 RNA helicase (Fig. 4C, lane 4). Thus our RNA unwinding assays have demonstrated that the bacterially expressed recombinant p68 RNA helicase unwound RNA duplex in both 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ directions. We presented in this report the expression and purification of recombinant p68 RNA helicase from an E. coli expression system, and we demonstrated that the protein is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase. We have shown that the ATPase activity of the recombinant protein is greatly enhanced by dsRNA. The RNA-binding assays demonstrated that p68 RNA helicase binds ssRNA weakly in an ATP-dependent manner. On the other hand, the recombinant protein has very strong affinity for dsRNA. The binding of the protein to dsRNA is ATP-independent. Interestingly, the bacterially expressed recombinant p68 helicase unwinds dsRNA in both 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′ directions. This is the second example of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases that unwinds RNA in both directions. It has been observed previously (31.Linder P. Daugeron M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the ATPase activity of so-called DEAD/DE xH box of ATPases is polynucleotide-dependent. More detailed characterization carried out with eIF-4A suggested that ATP binding and hydrolysis are tightly coupled to polynucleotide binding by the protein (32.Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2194-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33.Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2180-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that binding and hydrolysis of ATP, in return, has great effects on the polynucleotides binding by a DEAD/DE xH box protein. Consistent with the previous observations (15.Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20.Iggo R.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the ATPase activity of the recombinant p68 is strictly polynucleotide-dependent. We also observed that the ssRNA binding affinities of the recombinant p68 RNA helicase in the presence and absence of ATP are different. In the absence of ATP, the ssRNA binding by the recombinant protein is not detectable by our gel mobility shift assay. Thus, the data from the experiments support the notion that ATP binding and hydrolysis change the RNA-binding properties of an RNA helicase. The dsRNA-binding property of p68 is unique in the DEAD/DE xH box family. It was assumed that RNA helicases, especially those that act as monomer, should recognize dsRNA substrate (9.Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 34.Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although sequence alignments revealed that a number of other RNA helicases, including human helicase A, Drosophilamaleless, and Caenorhabditis elegans ORF T20G5, contained sequence motifs that closely resemble the dsRNA-binding motif (34.Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), none of the RNA helicases have demonstrated dsRNA binding. What is the functional role of this dsRNA-binding property of p68? Because the dsRNA substrate is much more effective than an ssRNA substrate in stimulating the ATPase activity, it is likely that the dsRNA binding is functional relevant to the enzymatic activity of the protein. The best explanation for the functional role of the dsRNA binding is that, unlike many other DEAD/DE xH box proteins that load on the RNA substrate at the single-stranded 5′- or 3′-overhangs (35.Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), p68 RNA helicase may directly load on a dsRNA substrate. To test this possibility, we reasoned that the 3′ or 5′ single-stranded overhangs of RNA substrate may not be required for RNA unwinding. Thus, we carried out unwinding experiments using a dsRNA substrate with only a 1-nt 3′-overhang on the one side and a 2-nt 3′-overhang on the other side. However, due to quick annealing of the separated ssRNA, we were unable to reach unambiguous conclusions (data not shown). Because p68 RNA helicase was shown to potentially have RNA annealing activities (13.Rossler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), an alternative possibility is that the dsRNA-stimulated ATPase activity is required for the RNA annealing activity of the protein. Our data showed the strong dsRNA-binding properties by p68 in the presence and absence of ATP. The effects of ATP binding and hydrolysis on the dsRNA binding are, however, not determined under our current experiments. It will be interesting to perform further experiments to determine what are the effects of the ATP binding and hydrolysis on the dsRNA binding. It is conceivable that ATP binding and hydrolysis would have opposite effects on the dsRNA binding in the above two alternative possibilities. The modes and mechanisms of RNA binding by the DEAD/DE xH box RNA helicases are not well understood. The three-dimensional structure of the HCV-NS3:oligonucleotide complex revealed that the nucleic acid is bound in the second cleft between the domain 1–2 and domain 3 (36.Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar,37.Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, this nucleic acid binding cleft of HCV-NS3 is not clearly defined in the assembled three-dimensional structure of translation initiation factor, eIF-4A (38.Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39.Benz J. Trachsel H. Baumann U. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 671-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 40.Caruthers J.M. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13080-13085Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses and RNA binding studies with a number of DEAD/DE xH boxes of RNA helicases revealed weak RNA binding by the common sequence motif VI in the DEAD/DE xH box. The weak RNA-binding property of this motif is believed to play an important catalytic role in RNA unwinding (41.Pause A. Methot N. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6789-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition to the RNA binding by motif VI, many DEAD/DE xH boxes of RNA helicases also bind RNA with additional RNA-binding motifs (13.Rossler O.G. Straka A. Stahl H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2088-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42.Lorkovic Z.J. Herrmann R.G. Oelmuller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 43.Fuller-Pace F.V. Nicol S.M. Reid A.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the relationship between the enzymatic activities and the RNA-binding by these additional RNA binding motifs has not yet been demonstrated. An interesting question regarding the strong dsRNA binding by the recombinant p68 is whether the dsRNA substrate is bound by the sequence motif VI in the DEAD box or by any other sequence motifs outside of the DEAD box. If the dsRNA substrate is bound outside of the DEAD box, how are the enhancement effects of dsRNA binding on the ATPase activity explained? It was noted previously (15.Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) that p68 RNA helicase contained sequence motifs at its C terminus that resemble the RGG repeats. Is it possible that this sequence motif contributes to dsRNA binding? The amino acid sequence of p68 RNA helicase does not contain any recognizable double-stranded RNA-binding motif. Thus, the dsRNA binding by p68 RNA helicase may represent a new dsRNA recognition mechanism. The bacterially expressed recombinant p68 RNA helicase unwinds dsRNA in both 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ directions. To date, the bi-directional RNA unwinding activities are peculiar to two DEAD box helicases. The DEAD box of RNA helicase eIF-4A in complex with eIF-4B unwound dsRNA in a bi-directional manner (14.Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The exact functional relevance of this bi-directional RNA unwinding is not clear. It was suggested that this bi-directional RNA unwinding property of eIF-4A played an important role in helping the ribosome land on the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA for translation initiation. p68 RNA helicase was suspected to be involved in a number of biological processes (8.Luking A. Stahl U. Schmidt U. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 259-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), including pre-mRNA splicing,2 RNA degradation (44.He F. Jacobson A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 437-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), ribosome biogenesis (45.Nicol S.M. Causevic M. Prescott A.R. Fuller-Pace F.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and transcriptional regulation (46.Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,47.Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It would be expected that p68 must be able to work on wide spectra of nucleic acids targets. The wide variety of putative RNA substrates may require the protein to be able to unwind RNA duplex in both directions. An alternative possibility is that, as discussed above, p68 may directly target dsRNA for its unwinding substrate. The single-stranded overhangs are really not required. Therefore, the dsRNAs with 3′ or 5′ or without single-stranded overhangs are the equal unwinding substrates for the protein. Unlike eIF-4A, which mainly unwinds dsRNA by complex with eIF-4B, p68 RNA helicase does not need a helper to unwind RNA. Although the functional relevance of the bi-directional RNA unwinding by p68 is not clear, the RNA unwinding by the protein will potentially provide an excellent model system to characterize the mechanism and functional relevance of this bi-directional RNA unwinding.

Through the phosphorylation of substrates, ERK1/2 signaling plays an important role in numerous biological processes, notably those involving differentiation and growth control. The activation of ERK1/2 requires phosphorylation of both a threonine and tyrosine residue located within a flexible surface loop adjacent to the enzyme active site (3.Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J.

Both of these phosphorylations are catalyzed by the dual-specificity protein kinases MAP/ERK kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2; also called MKK1/2) (5.Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M.

Such MAP kinase modules are conserved in all eukaryotes. In mammals, four distinct MAP kinase modules have been well defined experimentally and all appear to employ a three-kinase cascade (1.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14373-14381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, MEK level kinases appear to be dedicated activators of specific MAP kinases. For example, in vitro experiments have shown that MEK1 and MEK2 do not phosphorylate other MAP kinases such as the stress-activated p38 MAP kinases or ERK5 (11.Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12.English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Conversely, MEK3/6 and MEK4, which activate p38 MAP kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases, respectively, do not phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2in vitro (11.Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Overexpression studies in transfected mammalian cells have shown a similar theme. MEK3 and MEK6 activate specific p38 MAP kinase isoforms to varying degrees, suggesting that exacting specificities may be intrinsic to MAP kinase signaling modules (13.Enslen H. Brancho D.M. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). How this tight biochemical coupling between MAP kinases and their specific upstream activators (MEKs) is achieved is beginning to be elucidated. The search for the structural elements within MAP kinases that determine their specificity for upstream MEKs was begun by Brunet and Pouysségur (14.Brunet A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1653-1655Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), who reported that elements within the N-terminal domains of MAP kinases dictate which upstream signals lead to their activation in cells. Their findings using p38-ERK1 chimeras implicated α-helix C, β-strand 4, and the first part of β-strand 5 as determinants of specificity for MEK recognition. In vitroexperiments using ERK2 mutants and several sets of MAP kinase chimeras suggested that multiple elements in both domains participate in the MEK-MAP kinase interaction. These included the extreme N terminus of ERK2, α-helix C, β-strands 4 and 5, and the L16 segment from the N-terminal domain, and the activation loop and MAP kinase insert from the C-terminal domain (11.Wilsbacher J.L.

How these various MAP kinase structural elements contribute to MEK binding and phosphoryl-transfer is unclear. Specific residues in the C-terminal L16 segment have been proposed to play a key role in the docking of MAP kinases to substrates and phosphatases, as well as to MEKs (20.Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T.

These residues, which include Asp316 and Asp319 in rat ERK2, are thought to bind to a conserved peptide motif known as a docking (D) domain, which is found in many MAP kinase-binding proteins (13.Enslen H.

Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The acidic residues of the L16 segment, which are part of the putative D domain-binding site, are located on the opposite surface of ERK2 from the activation loop. This site has been termed the common docking (CD) domain (21.Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic amino acids, on the surface of ERK2 and immediately adjacent to Asp316, also play a role in MEK1-ERK2 docking (22.Xu B. Stippec S. Robinson F.L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26509-26515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The CD domain plays an important role in the binding of D domain-containing proteins to MAP kinases. However, additional protein elements within ERK2 play essential roles in binding to MEK1. Here we used a two-hybrid screen of an ERK2 mutant library to identify residues specifically involved in the interaction with MEK1/2. The wild type rat ERK2 cDNA was PCR amplified using oligonucleotides FRO-5 (GGCCGGATCCCATCATGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCG) and FRO-9 (CCGGGGCTCGAGTCAAGATCTGTATCCTGGCTGGAATCG) and the resulting DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into pGAD-GH (30.Van Aelst L. Barr M. Marcus S. Polverino A. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6213-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) which had been cut with the same enzymes. The resulting construct encodes full-length ERK2 fused to the C terminus of the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (GAD). Two-hybrid vectors encoding LexA fusion proteins were generated by PCR amplifying specific cDNAs with 5′ and 3′ primers that introduced BamHI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites flanking the various coding sequences. The resulting DNA fragments were digested with BamHI andXhoI and ligated into pVJL11 (31.Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) that had been digested with BamHI and SalI. The resulting constructs encode the various proteins fused to the C terminus of the LexA DNA-binding domain. Mammalian expression vectors encoding triple FLAG epitope-tagged ERK2 and ERK2 mutants were constructed by digesting pGAD-ERK2 with BamHI and XhoI and ligating the resulting DNA fragment into p3XFLAG-CMV7.1 (Sigma number E4026), which had been digested with BglII and SalI. All plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm that spurious mutations were not introduced. Pairwise interaction tests were carried out as follows. The yeast strain L40 (32.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) was co-transformed with pGAD-ERK2 (or ERK2 mutants) and either the empty pVJL11 (LexA) vector or pVJL11-based constructs encoding LexA fusions with various sequences from human MEK1, human MEK2, human MNK1, rat MKP3, or chicken RSK. Co-transformants were selected by plating cells on complete supplemental medium (CSM) (BIO 101, Inc., number 4530-522) lacking Leu and Trp. Protein-protein interactions were tested by streaking co-transformed isolates on CSM lacking His, Leu, and Trp and observing for growth. The expression of all LexA and GAD fusion proteins in yeast cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for either LexA or ERK1/2. For each combination of LexA and GAD plasmids to be tested, five independent yeast colonies were simultaneously used to inoculate 10 ml of liquid CSM-Leu-Trp medium. Such cultures were incubated overnight at 30 °C. Yeast cells equivalent to 1.5 ml of a 1.5A 600 broth culture were collected by microcentrifugation, washed once with 1 ml of LacZ buffer (100 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4), and re-suspended in 350 μl ofLacZ buffer. This mixture was frozen using liquid nitrogen, thawed, and split into three 100-μl aliquots. To each aliquot, 681 μl of LacZ buffer and 19 μl of β-mercaptoethanol were added. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 160 μl ofo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside substrate (a 4 mg/ml solution in LacZ buffer), incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated with the addition of 400 μl of 1m Na2CO3. Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation and the amount of reaction product was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 420 nm. Under these assay conditions, 420-nm absorbance was linear with respect to β-galactosidase activity over a range ofA 420 values from <0.065 to 2.27 (data not shown). The full-length ERK2 cDNA was mutagenized by low-fidelity PCR usingTaq DNA polymerase (33.Zhou Y.H. Zhang X.P. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Specifically, pGAD-ERK2 was amplified using primers FRO-30 (GAGATCCTAGAACTAGTGGATCCC) and FRO-31 (GGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAG), which flank the ERK2 coding sequence at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The resulting mixture of mutagenized ERK2 cDNAs was digested with BamHI andXhoI and ligated into pGAD-GH that had been digested withBamHI and XhoI and the ligation products were used to transform Escherichia coli. The resulting mutant library contained 2 × 106 potentially unique ERK2 cDNAs and its predicted mutation rate was such that 65% of the cDNAs should have contained a single mutation. Similar screens have been used to identify target-specific mutations in the p21 Ras GTPase (34.Kaur K.J. White M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The pGAD-ERK2 mutant library was transformed into the yeast strain L40 (MATa) and plated on CSM-Leu agar at a density of about 103 colonies per 150-mm plate. These arrayed mutant clones were duplicated by replica plating, and subsequently mated to lawns of the yeast strain AMR70 (MATα) (32.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) that had been transformed with either pLexA-MEK1-K97M or pLexA-MNK1. Diploids were selected by replica plating onto CSM-Leu-Trp plates. Protein-protein interactions were then tested by replica plating diploids onto CSM-His-Leu-Trp plates and observing colonies for growth. MEK1-specific ERK2 mutants were identified as those which failed to grow on CSM-His-Leu-Trp medium when co-transformed with pLexA-MEK1-K97M, but grew normally when co-transformed with pLexA-MNK1. Approximately 104 yeast colonies were screened in this manner. Yeast colonies having a MEK1-specific mutant interaction profile were isolated from the original CSM-Leu library plates and their mutant pGAD-ERK2 plasmids were isolated and used to transform E. coli. Plasmid DNA was then prepared and mutated ERK2 cDNAs were sequenced. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected at 60–80% confluence in 60-mm dishes by adding 0.45 ml of a calcium phosphate precipitate, containing 1.4 μg of each plasmid DNA, to the 5 ml of culture medium. Transfection efficiency was between 30 and 50%. After 16 h of incubation, the precipitate-containing medium was removed and replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 24 h later, cells were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. The culture medium was then removed and the cells were lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.15m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa-orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10.5 μg/ml aprotinin) and microcentrifuged for 5 min. 5–12 μl of the resulting cleared lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies specific for phospho-ERK1/2 (BIOSOURCE Int. number 44-680), total ERK1/2 (Y691 serum) (35.Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) or MEK1 (Santa Cruz number SC-219) were used for immunoblotting as described in Ref. 36.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar. Four μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma number F3165) was added to 0.2 ml of cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. 30 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Bioscience number 17-0963-03) in lysis buffer was added and this mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were washed 3 times with 1 ml of 1m NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) followed by once in 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2. The drained beads were resuspended in a 30-μl kinase reaction mixture (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine) that contained 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μg of GST-Myc (Myc residues 1–103). Kinase reaction tubes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, placed on ice, and terminated by adding 7.5 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Twenty μl of this mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gels). Gels were fixed, Coomassie-stained, dried, and used for autoradiography. Gel bands corresponding to the GST-Myc substrate were excised and their radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. MEK1 and MEK2 immunoprecipitations were performed as above except that antibodies A2227 (MEK1-specific) and A2228 (MEK2-specific) (37.Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) were used. MEK1/2 kinase assays were carried out as those described for ERK2 except that 5 μg of GST-ERK2-K52R protein was used as substrate. His6-tagged ERK2 and ERK2 mutants were expressed in E. coli using the NpT75-His6-ERK2 construct (38.Zhang F. Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Phosphorylation reactions (50 μl) contained 3 μm(unphosphorylated) ERK2, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 MgCl2, 3 mm ATP containing 100 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP, and 10–200 μmmyelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma number M-1891) (39.Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of the ATP mixture, incubated at room temperature for 45 min, placed on ice, and immediately terminated by adding 13 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. MBP bands were excised from gels and their radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Kinetic constants were determined by graphing and fitting the data to the equation: y =Vmax *x/(K m + x), where y is the reaction velocity and x is the MBP concentration using SigmaPlot 5.0 software. HEK293 cells were cultured on collagen-coated coverslips placed in 60-mm dishes until reaching 50% confluence. One ml of a calcium phosphate precipitate containing 4 μg of each plasmid DNA was added to the 5 ml of culture medium. Transfection efficiency was 20–30%. After an overnight incubation, cells were deprived of serum for 24 h, fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3.7% formaldehyde and made permeable by incubating in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma number F3165). Cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min in PBS-bovine serum albumin containing a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Alexa 488) that was diluted 1:3000. Cells were mounted using Polymount and visualized using a Zeiss Axiocam Microscope with Open Lab Software. To analyze the nature of the ERK2-MEK1/2 interaction detected in two-hybrid tests, we examined the interaction of ERK2 with wild type MEK1 and MEK2, as well as with several mutant forms of these MEKs. A fusion of ERK2 to the LexA DNA-binding domain independently activated transcription of the HIS3 auxotrophy reporter gene borne by the yeast strain L40 (data not shown). For this reason, a fusion of ERK2 to the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (GAD-ERK2) was used in all two-hybrid experiments. Although wild type MEK1 interacted only weakly with ERK2, the catalytically defective mutant MEK1-K97M interacted robustly with ERK2 in two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1). In contrast to MEK1, MEK2 interacted well with ERK2 in both the wild type and catalytically inactive forms (MEK2-K101A) (Fig. 1). To determine whether the MEK1 D domain (residues 3–11) is required for interaction with ERK2 in two-hybrid assays, we examined the interaction of ERK2 with a MEK1 mutant lacking the N-terminal 32 amino acids (MEK1-(33–393)) (16.Xu B. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21.Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). ERK2 did not interact with MEK1-(33–393), but did interact with the catalytically inactive mutant MEK1-(33–393)-K97M (Fig. 1), indicating that the MEK1 D domain is not required for a two-hybrid interaction with ERK2. Interactions between ERK2 and several isolated D domain sequences were also examined. ERK2 did not interact with the D domain-containing fragment of MEK1 (residues 1–32, Fig. 1). This result is consistent with our finding that the MEK1 D domain is not required for the two-hybrid interaction of ERK2 and MEK1-K97M. However, ERK2 did associate with a previously characterized 64-residue docking site from the C terminus of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK-(689–752), Fig. 1), which contains a D domain at its extreme C terminus (41.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 42.Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In keeping with previous findings, deletion of the D domain sequence from this construct (RSK-(689–738)) eliminated the interaction with ERK2 (Fig. 1) (41.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These two-hybrid tests suggest significant differences in the affinity of ERK2 for various D domain sequences. To assess the importance of the activation state of MEK to the MEK-ERK interaction, we examined the two-hybrid interaction of ERK2 with constitutively active MEKs. ERK2 failed to interact with the constitutively active MEK mutants MEK1-R4F and MEK2-R4F (40.Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This result was expected based on suggestions in the literature that stable MEK·ERK complexes are not formed when ERK2 is phosphorylated on Tyr185 (17.Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the MEK1 D domain is not required for a two-hybrid interaction between ERK2 and MEK1-K97M. In addition, they suggest that the strength of the ERK2-MEK1 interaction is increased when MEK1 is catalytically inactive, perhaps due to a lack of phosphorylation of ERK2 on Tyr185 (17.Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Several regions of MAP kinases have been implicated in interactions with MEKs (11.Wilsbacher J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2024507347,"The role of the hepatitis B virus protein HBx in liver cell proliferation and apoptosis remains controversial. Using a transgenic mouse model, we have recently shown that HBx stimulates the apoptotic turnover of hepatocytes, independently of p53. In this paper, we tested whether the proapoptotic function of HBx can interfere with Bcl-2 during hepatic apoptosis in vivo. HBx transgenic mice were crossed with PK-hBcl-2 mice that are protected against Fas killing by constitutive overexpression of Bcl-2 in hepatocytes. In a lethal challenge with Fas antibodies, HBx expressed at low levels restored sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis and fulminant hepatic failure in mice overexpressing Bcl-2. Furthermore, cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase 3 activation were restored to normal levels in HBx/Bcl-2 mice during transduction of the Fas signal. Thus, the proapoptotic activity of HBx overcomes or bypasses the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 against Fas cytotoxicity. This effect was not apparently mediated through downregulation of the PK-hBcl-2 transgene or via delocalization of the Bcl-2 protein, and a direct interaction of HBx with Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) or Bax could not be evidenced in yeast two-hybrid assays. We further show that apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of HBx is associated with mitochondrial membrane alterations and caspase 3 activation. Our data indicate that the dominant function of HBx upon Bcl-2-regulated control of apoptosis might play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B."
https://openalex.org/W1997522623,"Adenovirus type 5 E1A protein (E1A) associates with anti-tumor activities by reversing the transformed phenotype, inhibiting metastasis, and inducing apoptosis. We have previously identified that E1A suppresses the expression of Axl, a transforming tyrosine kinase and that Axl-Gas6 receptor-ligand interaction prevents E1A transfectants from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. To determine how the Axl-Gas6 interaction prevents E1A-mediated apoptosis, we analysed the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules and found that the activated form of Akt was suppressed in the E1A transfectant ip 1-E1A and that Gas6 was able to activate Akt in ip 1-E1A cells reexpressing Axl (ip 1-E1A-Axl). To determine whether activated Akt is required to prevent E1A-mediated apoptosis, ip 1-E1A-Axl cells were treated with the phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase inhibitor wortmannin or transfected with a dominant negative Akt mutant. In both cases, Gas6 no longer protected the cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Thus, we conclude that activated Akt is required for Axl-Gas6 signaling to prevent E1A-mediated apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Downstream molecules of Akt, including NF-kappaB, Fas ligand, and BAD were examined, among which phosphorylation of BAD by Axl-Gas6 signaling is associated with the anti-apoptotic activity of Akt in our study."

However, the identity of constituents of the BCR signaling cascade that leads to cyclin D2 accumulation remains incomplete. We report that inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-1/2 blocked BCR-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Inhibition of the MEK1/2-ERK pathway was sufficient to abrogate BCR-induced cyclin D2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Disruption of endogenous heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) function with geldanamycin abrogated BCR-induced cyclin D2 expression and proliferation. Geldanamycin effects were attributed to a selective depletion of cellular Raf-1 that interrupted BCR-coupled activation of MEK1/2 and ERK. By contrast, signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways was not affected, suggesting that disruption of hsp90 function did not cause a general impairment of BCR signaling. These results suggest that the MEK1/2-ERK pathway is essential for BCR signaling to cyclin D2 accumulation in ex vivo splenic B lymphocytes. Furthermore, these findings imply that hsp90 function is required for BCR signaling through the Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK pathway but not through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- or protein kinase C-dependent pathways.

Furthermore, these findings imply that hsp90 function is required for BCR signaling through the Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK pathway but not through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- or protein kinase C-dependent pathways.

These distinct cell fates are determined, at least in part, by the developmental stage of the lymphocyte and through the coordinate regulation of signaling pathways by the BCR in response to binding of monovalent versus polyvalent antigen. BCR signaling is triggered by the activation of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), and Syk (1.Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv.

These PTKs, in turn, coordinate the activation of multiple signal transduction cascades, including phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 and -γ2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the Vav/Rho family pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (1.Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Campbell K.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recent efforts have focused on understanding how individual signaling pathways lead to distinct cell fates (1.Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the nature of signal transduction that controls BCR-induced proliferation in mature B cells remains incomplete. In mammalian cells, the D-type cyclins are considered end point targets of mitogenic signaling pathways and function as growth factor sensors (4.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar, 5.Ekholm S. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The requirement of D-type cyclins in G1 phase progression has been definitively established in mammalian cells (5.Ekholm S. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin.

Several findings contribute to the emerging view that CDK4/6, together with CDK2, represent the primary protein kinases that drive cells through G1 phase, presumably through the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) (11.Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 12.Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). A current model holds that sequential phosphorylation of pRb by CDK4/6 and CDK2 disrupts its association with E2F family proteins, leading to the coordinated transcription of E2F-responsive genes directly involved in G1/S transition and DNA metabolism (11.Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar).We and others have shown previously that cyclin D2, and to a lesser extent cyclin D3, are induced in response to BCR cross-linking (13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar,14.Solvason N. Wu W.W. Kabra N. Wu X. Lees E. Howard M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Definitive evidence in support of cyclin D2 in BCR-induced proliferation came from studies with cyclin D2-deficient mice, which exhibit normal levels of splenic B cells in comparison with wild-type littermates; however, ex vivo splenic B cells fail to proliferate in response to BCR cross-linking (15.Solvason N. Wu W.W. Parry D. Mahony D. Lam E. Glassford J. Klaus G. Sicinski P. Weinberg R. Liu Y.J. Howard M. Lees E. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the principal initial determinant of cell cycle progression following BCR engagement in mature B cells lies in the sustained accumulation of cyclin D2. Despite these findings, little is known about the nature of signaling pathways that couple BCR to cyclin D2 accumulation in splenic B cells. In many nonlymphoid cell types, activation of the Ras-coupled mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway promotes cell cycle entry and proliferation (reviewed in Refs. 4.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar and 5.Ekholm S. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This is achieved, in part, through Ras signaling de novo transcription of the cyclin D1 gene (16.Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 17.Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Ras, together with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, can increase D-type cyclin protein availability by enhancing mRNA translation; this pathway also negatively regulates ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 (18.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar, 19.Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol.

Dave S.H. Chou C.-H.G. Mamchak A.A. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is also activated during BCR-induced apoptosis in WEHI-231 B cells and autoreconstituted splenic B cells, which exhibit an immature B cell phenotype; however, specific inhibitors of MEK1/2 do not block BCR-induced G1 phase arrest or apoptosis in these lymphocyte models (20.Richards J.D. Dave S.H. Chou C.-H.G. Mamchak A.A. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that activation of the MEK1/2-ERK pathway is a requisite for cyclin D2 expression and hence G1-to-S phase progression following BCR cross-linking on mature B cells. This view has been challenged by studies in mice with deletional mutations of the B cell signalosome. Splenic B cells from B cell linker (BLNK)- and Vav-deficient mice fail to proliferate in response to BCR cross-linking due to impaired cyclin D2 expression (21.Tan J.E.-L. Wong S.-W. Gan S.K.-E.

BCR signaling in these mutant mice exhibits impaired PLC-γ2 activation and Ca2+mobilization, whereas activation of the MEK1/2-ERK pathway is normal. In the present study, we sought to determine whether activation of MEK1/2 and ERK is required for BCR-induced cyclin D2 expression in ex vivo cultures of splenic B cells. Results of this study indicate that Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK are necessary for BCR-induced expression of cyclin D2. Our findings also suggest that the Raf-1/MEK1/2-ERK pathway requires functional heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) in order to signal induction of cyclin D2 gene expression by BCR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and ReagentsProtein A/G-agarose, anti-cyclin D2, anti-mouse CDK4, anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Abs) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.Preparation of Splenic B LymphocytesBalb/c mice at 8–12 weeks were obtained from Taconic Laboratories (Germantown, NY) and housed at Boston College. Mice were cared for and handled at all times in accordance with National Institutes of Health and Boston College institutional guidelines. Mature B lymphocytes were isolated from spleens by depletion of T cells with anti-Thy-1.2 plus rabbit complement (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) (13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar); macrophages (and other adherent cells) were removed by plastic adherence. Red blood cells and nonviable cells were removed by sedimentation on Lympholyte M (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp.). B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 × 10−5m2-ME, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker). B cells were maintained in a 37 °C humidified incubator at 5% CO2.Immunoblotting and ImmunoprecipitationB lymphocytes were solubilized at 2 × 107/100 μl in 0.1% Triton X-100-containing buffer as described (13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular proteins were separated through polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunodetection of proteins was carried out as previously described (13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40-solubilized cell lysates according to the method described by Zhang et al. (23.Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with 1.5 μg of the indicated Abs (5 h), followed by the addition of 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A/G-agarose (90 min). The protein A/G-agarose was collected by centrifugation and washed eight times with 1 ml of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer. The immunoprecipitates were dissociated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated through a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and immunoblotted. Where indicated, the resulting autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer equipped with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).RNA Isolation and RT-PCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated from 2 × 107 splenic B cells using Ultraspec Reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX) denaturing solution following the manufacturer's protocol. Purified RNA was treated with 1 unit of DNase I using DNA-free (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 2 μg of total RNA using the RETROscriptTM first strand synthesis kit (Ambion, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of cDNA in each sample was adjusted to produce similar amounts of product following quantitative PCR with primers specific for β2-microglobulin gene (β2-microglobulin sense primer corresponds to 5′-cggtcgcttcagtcgtcagc-3′; antisense primer corresponds to 5′-cccagtagacggtcttggg-3′). The PCRs were performed in 25-μl final reaction volumes, each consisting of 5 μl of template cDNA using reagents from GeneAmpR PCR kit (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ) supplemented with 10 μCi of α-[32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amplification was conducted with an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient (Brinkmann Instrument, Inc. Westbury, NY). Temperature cycling parameters for the β2-microglobulin gene were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 17 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min for annealing, and 72 °C for 1 min. A 72 °C final elongation step for 10 min was included following the last cycle. PCRs were optimized with respect to Mg2+ concentration, pH, annealing temperature, and the number of cycles as described (24.Huo L. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3300-3309PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products (20 μl) were electrophoresed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel and then visualized by autoradiography. The identity of each PCR product was determined based on its expected size. Autoradiographic bands were quantitated with the aid of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Under these conditions, the number of PCR cycles and the amount of cDNA used were such that increasing amounts of cDNA template yielded proportionately increasing amounts of β2-microglobulin-specific PCR product (data not shown). The variation of β2-microglobulin PCR product between adjusted samples was ±5%, as judged by densitometric analysis of the resulting autoradiograms. The number of cycles and amount of cDNA used were then adjusted accordingly to yield the same signal output. Cyclin D2 cDNA was then amplified from the normalized β2-microglobulin cDNA samples using the identical PCR and temperature cycling parameters. The sequence of the cyclin D2 primer set corresponds cyclin D2 sense primer 5′-agctgtccctgatccgcaag-3′ and antisense primer 5′-gtcaacatcccgcacgtctg-3′.RESULTSInhibition of MEK1/2 Blocks BCR-induced ERK Activity in Splenic B CellsPD98059 has been shown to act in vivo as a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 activation and the ERK1/2 cascade, without affecting the related MEK family kinases, MKK3, MKK6, SEK/MKK4, or their immediate downstream effector kinases, JNK and p38 MAPK (25.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar). Likewise, U0126 is a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 and downstream ERK1/2, without affecting p38 MAPK, JNK, or numerous other protein kinases (e.g. protein kinase C, CDK4, or Raf-1) (26.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.L. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol.

The three major classes of mammalian MAPKs are rapidly and transiently activated following BCR cross-linking in B cells (1.Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Richards J.D. Dave S.H. Chou C.-H.G. Mamchak A.A. DeFranco A.L. J.

To determine the specificity of PD98059 and U0126 as inhibitors of BCR-induced ERK1/2 activity in ex vivo splenic B lymphocyte cultures, whole cell extracts were prepared from quiescent B cells, and cells were mitogenically stimulated with 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2 fragments of mouse anti-IgM (anti-Ig) pretreated for 60 min in the presence or absence of PD98059 or U0126. The concentrations of MEK1/2 inhibitors used herein were selected based on a recent report demonstrating that 10 μm PD98059 or 10 μm U0126 inhibited proliferation of splenic B cells stimulated with anti-Ig (20.Richards J.D. Dave S.H. Chou C.-H.G. Mamchak A.A. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 2F. Dufort and T. C. Chiles, unpublished observations. Immunoblotting was carried out with highly specific anti-p44/p42 ERK, anti-SAPK/JNK, and anti-p38 MAPK Abs that recognize the corresponding dually phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine motifs, indicative of catalytically active MAPKs. Treatment with either 10 μmPD98059 or 10 μm U0126 blocked BCR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in splenic B cells when measured at 20 min (Fig. 1A). U0126 appeared to be more effective than PD98059 as an inhibitor of BCR-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation at the concentration tested. The membrane was reprobed with anti-p44/p42 ERK Ab to confirm that the differences in phosphorylation were not due to changes in total cellular ERK. By contrast, BCR-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK or p38 MAPK was not measurably reduced by inhibition of MEK1/2 (Fig. 1A). The extracts were also probed with anti-β-actin mAb to verify that an equal amount of cellular protein was being compared between conditions (Fig. 1A). It is noteworthy that basal and BCR-induced phosphorylation of individual MAPKs were not affected by pretreatment of parallel B cells with the corresponding solvent controls (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that PD98059 and U0126 selectively inhibit ERK activation in response to BCR cross-linking. These results are consistent with a more detailed report confirming the selectively of these reagents as inhibitors of the MEK1/2-ERK pathway in splenic B cells (20.Richards J.D. Dave S.H. Chou C.-H.G. Mamchak A.A. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).BCR Induction of Cyclin D2 mRNA Is Dependent on MEK1/2-ERK ActivitySeveral laboratories, including our own, have shown that cross-linking the BCR induces cyclin D2 protein expression (13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Solvason N. Wu W.W. Kabra N. Wu X. Lees E. Howard M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By contrast, little is known about the regulation of cyclin D2 mRNA expression in mature B cells. A report by Reid and Snow (28.Reid S. Snow E.C. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) indicates that mitogenic stimulation of splenic B cells with phorbol diester plus ionomycin leads to expression of cyclin D2 mRNA within 4 h, with maximal levels occurring by 18 h. Based on these results, RNA was isolated from splenic B cells stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-Ig for 4 and 18 h, and cyclin D2 gene expression was measured by RT-PCR. Control B cells express a relatively low level of cyclin D2 mRNA, which increased ∼2- and 7-fold in response to BCR cross-linking at 4 and 18 h, respectively (Fig. 1B). To test whether activation of the MEK1/2-ERK pathway was required for BCR-induced cyclin D2 mRNA accumulation, B cells were cultured in medium alone or stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-Ig, after a 60-min preincubation in the presence of 10 μm U0126. Anti-Ig-induced cyclin D2 mRNA accumulation was completely suppressed by 10 μm U0126 at the 4- and 18-h time points (Fig. 1C). Treatment with 10 μm PD98059 also led to a reduced accumulation of cyclin D2 mRNA in response to anti-Ig stimulation at 4 and 18 h (Fig. 1D); however, PD98059 did not completely suppress cyclin D2 mRNA induction, which may reflect its inability to completely suppress BCR-induced ERK activation (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that MEK1/2-ERK activity is required for the accumulation of cyclin D2 mRNA following BCR cross-linking in splenic B cells.BCR Induction of Cyclin D2 Protein but Not CDK4 Requires Active MEK1/2-ERKBy having observed that the accumulation of cyclin D2 mRNA in response to BCR cross-linking is dependent upon an active MEK1/2-ERK pathway, we next determined whether these effects were mirrored at the level of cyclin D2 protein. Quiescent splenic B cells were pretreated with U0126 or PD98059 as above and then stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-Ig for 18 h. The presence of 10 μm U0126 led to a nearly complete inhibition of anti-Ig-induced cyclin D2 protein accumulation (Fig. 2A). PD98059 also reduced cyclin D2 protein accumulation in response to anti-Ig stimulation, although its inhibitory effect was not as great in comparison with U0126 (Fig. 2B). The reduction in cyclin D2 protein in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitors did not arise from changes in the total amount of cellular protein being compared across conditions, as evidenced by equal levels of β-actin expression (Fig. 2, β-actin).Figure 2MEK1/2-ERK activity is required for cyclin D2 protein accumulation and pRb phosphorylation. Quiescent splenic B cells (M) were incubated for 18 h with 10 μg/ml anti-Ig (aIg) in the presence or absence of a 60-min pretreatment with 10 μm U0126 (A and C; denoted U) or 10 μm PD98059 (B; denoted P) or an equal volume of the corresponding solvent vehicle (S). Note that the corresponding solvent vehicles had no measurable effect on cyclin D2 or CDK4 expression in quiescent B cells (data not shown). Cyclin D2 and CDK4 protein levels in whole cell extracts were measured by immunoblotting with anti-cyclin D2 (A and B) and anti-CDK4 (C) Abs. D, quiescent splenic B cells (M) were incubated for 24 h with 10 μg/ml anti-Ig (aIg) or anti-Ig following a 60-min pretreatment with 10 μm U0126 (U). Note that quiescent and anti-Ig stimulated B cell cultures contained an equal volume of the solvent vehicle. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates was conducted with an anti-pRb mAb that recognizes both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated Rb or with anti-β−actin mAb to monitor β-actin levels. E, immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-pRb(Ser807/Ser811) Ab was also carried out to detect pRb phosphorylation on Ser807/Ser811. These data are representative of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CDK4 represents the primary G1-CDK target of cyclin D2 in mature splenic B cells, and the initial phosphorylation of endogenous pRb is mediated by cyclin D2-CDK4 holoenzyme complexes (5.Ekholm S. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine if the levels of CDK4 protein and pRb phosphorylation were affected in B cells treated with MEK1/2 inhibitors. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from quiescent B cells stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-Ig revealed that the accumulation of CDK4 protein was not affected by treatment with 10 μm U0126 at 18 h (Fig. 2C). Although CDK4 protein levels are not affected by U0126 or PD98059 (data not shown), the lack of sustained cyclin D2 accumulation is probably sufficient to prevent activation of endogenous CDK4. This is consistent with the finding that treatment with 10 μm U0126 is sufficient to inhibit anti-Ig-induced hyperphosphorylation of endogenous pRb (Fig. 2D).

Moreover, these transporters mediate a sodium- and glutamate-dependent uncoupled chloride conductance. In contrast to the wild type, the uptake of radiolabeled substrate by the I421C mutant is inhibited by the membrane-impermeant [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate and also by other sulfhydryl reagents. In the wild-type and the unmodified mutant, substrate-induced currents are inwardly rectifying and reflect the sum of the coupled electrogenic flux and the anion conductance. Remarkably, the I421C mutant modified by sulfhydryl reagents exhibits currents that are non-rectifying and reverse at the equilibrium potential for chloride. Strikingly, almost 10-fold higher concentrations ofd-aspartate are required to activate the currents in the modified mutant as compared with untreated I421C. Under conditions in which only the coupled currents are observed, the modified mutant does not exhibit any currents. However, when the uncoupled current is dominant, sulfhydryl reagents cause >4-fold stimulation of this current. Thus, the modification of the cysteine introduced at position 421 impacts the coupled but not the uncoupled fluxes.

Glutamate transporters have a non-conventional topology containing two reentrant loops, two transmembrane domains, as well as an outward facing hydrophobic linker region (22.Grunewald M. Bendahan A.

Two adjacent amino acid residues, tyrosine 403 and glutamate 404, of glutamate transporter-1 located in transmembrane domain 7 and conserved in all other glutamate transporters are required for potassium binding (15.Kavanaugh M.P.

It is activated by two of the molecules they transport, sodium and glutamate (20.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 30.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This indicates the existence of a tight link between gating of the anion conductance and permeation of glutamate. It has been suggested that this capacity for enhancing chloride permeability may serve to off-set the depolarization that occurs during glutamate transport (20.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). In a very recent study (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we have reported that in EAAC-1, lithium can replace sodium in the coupled uptake but not in its capacity to gate the glutamate-dependent anion conductance. This finding suggests that the conformation gating the anion conductance may be different from that during substrate translocation. If this idea is correct, it should be possible to selectively perturb one of the two fluxes mediated by the glutamate transporters. We have engineered externally accessible cysteines into EAAC-1 with the aim of introducing fluorescent maleimides to monitor conformational changes during transport. An analysis of one of the mutants with a cysteine residue introduced in the hydrophobic linker region revealed that the coupled uptake in this mutant is very sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. Strikingly, the substrate-induced anion conductance is not affected at all under these conditions. We have exploited the sulfhydryl-modified mutant to reveal novel properties of the substrate-gated anion-conducting state and its relation to the coupled transport cycle.

The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the above two restriction sites. HeLa cells were cultured in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries), infected with a recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7–3 (33.Fuerst R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For experiments using the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals), culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of choline uptake solution (sodium replaced with equimolar choline) and then incubated with 200 μl of uptake solution containing 500 μm MTSET for 2 min. Cells were washed again twice in 1 ml of choline uptake solution (37 °C) before the 10-min uptake assay was initiated by adding 200 μl of radioactive sodium uptake solution at 37 °C. Cells that did not receive MTSET were subjected to the same incubation and washing procedures. From dose-response experiments, the concentration of MTSET giving half-maximal inhibition was determined to be 5 μm (data not shown). 100–5000 × this concentration has been used on HeLa cells and oocytes in initial experiments to rule out the possibility that MTSET reacts with wild-type EAAC1. Capped run-off cRNA transcripts were made from transporter constructs in pOG2 and linearized withSacI using mMessage mMachine (Ambion), and Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared using collagenase type 1A (Sigma) or Blendzyme 3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and injected as described previously (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oocytes were maintained either in modified Barth's saline solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, with freshly added 2 mm sodium pyruvic acid and 0.5 mm theophylline) supplemented with 10,000 units/liter of penicillin, 10 mg/liter streptomycin, and 50 mg/liter gentamycin or in ND96-recording solution (see below) supplemented with 1.5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5 mm theophylline, and 2.5 mm pyruvic acid. Currents were measured fromX. laevis oocytes using conventional two-electrode voltage clamp recording as described previously (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Penetrated oocytes were gravity-perfused with ND96-recording solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES-hemisodium, pH 7.5). Sodium chloride and HEPES-hemisodium were replaced with equimolar choline chloride and free acid HEPES or replaced with equimolar lithium chloride and free acid HEPES in sodium replacement experiments (pH was adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris-OH in these solutions). In experiments using the highly permeant thiocyanate anion (Fig. 6), 2 mm KCl was replaced by 20 mmKSCN, and the sodium chloride concentration was varied by replacing NaCl with equimolar choline chloride. In these experiments, the extracellular grounding electrode was placed in 2 m KCl and connected to the recording chamber with an agar/2 m KCl bridge. Before applying either of the sulfhydryl reagents, MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals) or β-maleimidopropionic acid (Sigma), the flow was stopped, and the reagent was added directly into the bath under voltage clamp. Before applying the reducing agent, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), directly into the bath, the oocyte was unclamped, grounding electrode was removed, and the flow was stopped. MTSET and/or DTT was allowed to react for 2 min followed by an ∼10-min washout (in initial experiments using higher MTSET and DTT concentrations the washout time was 20 min). The net current was measured before MTSET application, after MTSET application, and after DTT application in that order. Both the MTSET and the β-maleimidopropionic acid stock solutions were made in the recording solution to which it was added (in the case of maleimide, pH was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH) and kept on ice for up to 2 h, and the DTT was made in 1 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The final concentrations in the bath of MTSET and DTT were 2.5–25 and 50 mm, respectively, in initial experiments and later concentrations were 1 and 10 mm, respectively, as estimated from the measured chamber volume in the presence of an oocyte. Unless stated otherwise, oocytes were perfused in recording solution with or without 1 mmd-aspartate orl-aspartate. Data have been normalized to account for variability in expression level within and between different oocyte batches. Steady-state net currents defined as (IND+d-Asp −IND) were analyzed using Clampfit6.05 and Origin6.1 (Microcal). The current-voltage relations shown were obtained by averaging the net currents at each holding potential from 218 to 248 ms. For representational purposes, the traces of the net currents shown in Figs. 2 and 4 have been low pass-filtered off-line using the boxcar algorithm (Clampfit). Concentrations of d-aspartate or sodium giving half-maximal currents (EC50) were determined with the generalized Hill equation (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using a fixed maximum current (Imax), and the determined EC50 and Hill number (nH) were used to generate the curves shown. Residuals were minimized with the Levenberg-Marquehardt method. The build-in functions of Origin6.1 were used for statistical testing. Data are the means ± S.E. of 3–10 oocytes from 2–4 different batches.Figure 4Net currents in lithium medium mediated byl-aspartate in I421C-EAAC-1 transporters. Currents recorded in the absence of l-aspartate during 250-ms voltage pulses from −100 to +40 mV were subtracted from currents during superfusion of 1 mml-aspartate. The application order of MTSET (1 mm) and DTT (10 mm) was as described in the legend to Fig. 2. A typical experiment is shown (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HeLa cells expressing the I421C-EAAC-1 mutant exhibit similar rates ofd-[3H]aspartate uptake as those in which the wild type is expressed (Fig. 1). However, in contrast to the wild type, this uptake is almost fully inhibited by preincubation of the cells with 500 μm of the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (Fig. 1). The introduction of a serine or an alanine residue at this position does not render EAAC-1 sensitive to MTSET (Fig. 1). These observations indicate that the inhibition of uptake in I421C-EAAC-1 is the result of the introduced cysteine and renders unlikely the possibility that the introduction of a cysteine at position 421 causes the transporter to expose an endogenous cysteine that could mediate the inhibition by the sulfhydryl reagent. When I421C-EAAC-1 is treated with a concentration of MTSET low enough (5 μm) to retain significant residual activity, the major impact is on maximal uptake (Vmax = 66 ± 6% inhibition (n = 3)). The apparent affinity for substrate (Km) is essentially unchanged (27 ± 5 and 25 ± 4 μm (n = 3)) for untreated and MTSET treated I421C, respectively. This finding indicates that the inactivation of uptake by MTSET is because of a progressive reduction of functional transporters. It is well established that in sodium-containing media, the addition of acidic amino acid substrates to oocytes expressing cloned glutamate transporters results in the activation of a current representing the sum of two currents. The first is a non-reversing inwardly rectifying current reflecting the coupled cycle, whereas the second is a reversing non-rectifying anion conductance that is thermodynamically uncoupled (20.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 21.Arriza J.L. Eliasof S. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The reversal potential of the combined current depends on the acidic amino acid substrate.l-Aspartate gives rise to the reversal at less positive potentials than l-glutamate and d-aspartate (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). An analysis of the d-aspartate-induced currents of oocytes expressing I421C-EAAC-1 in the presence and absence of MTSET reveals a remarkable result. Instead of currents, which are inward at the range of membrane potentials tested (−100 mV to +40 mV), preincubation with 1 mm MTSET results in currents that are almost symmetrical around the holding potential of −25 mV (Fig. 2). The treatment of the MTSET-modified mutant transporters with dithiothreitol, which is expected to restore the cysteine at the 421 position, also restores the voltage dependence of the d-aspartate-induced currents (Fig. 2). Similar results have been obtained when l-aspartate-induced currents are monitored (data not shown). Other sulfhydryl reagents such as (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate and β-maleimidopropionic acid modify the currents of I421C in a similar way as MTSET. As expected, DTT is able to restore the current modified by (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate but not by β-maleimidopropionic acid (data not shown). Plotting the average current/voltage relation (I/V plot) of six oocytes shows that MTSET treatment of I421C changes the behavior of the substrate-induced currents from inwardly rectifying to ohmic. The currents observed after MTSET treatment reverse at −25 mV (Fig. 3B). DTT restores the inwardly rectifying currents (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the I/V relations of wild-type EAAC-1 are not affected by MTSET (Fig. 3A). It is of interest to note that the reversal potential of the d-aspartate-induced currents of the MTSET-treated I421C transporters is approximately −25 mV (Fig. 3B), very close to the reversal potential of chloride (30.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Moreover, the I/V relation in this mutant is reminiscent of those in glutamate transporter-1 and EAAC-1 mutants, which are locked in the exchange mode (15.Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl.

Additional evidence supporting the idea that the currents observed with MTSET-modified I421C transporters solely represent the anion conductance is provided in Fig. 4. We have very recently found that in the presence of lithium, EAAC-1 transporters mediate the coupled current only (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). If the currents from MTSET-modified I421C solely are the result of the substrate-induced anion conductance, one would predict that in lithium medium no current will be observed at all. Because netd-aspartate currents in lithium medium are rather small, we have displayed the currents obtained withl-aspartate. The latter substrate gives rise to larger currents in lithium medium (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, MTSET-treated I421C transporters do not exhibit any significantl-aspartate-induced currents in lithium medium. Again, the effect of MTSET can be reversed by DTT. The selective elimination of the coupled current in I421C by MTSET allows us to study the substrate-activated gating of the anion conductance in isolation from substrate translocation. One prediction is that the reversal potential of the current should be independent of the concentration of d-aspartate, but this would not be expected for the size of the current. Indeed, at increasingd-aspartate concentrations, the reversal potential remains the same (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the size of the current representing the opening of more chloride channels increases with the increasing d-aspartate concentration (Fig. 5B). The dependence of the current of untreated I421C-EAAC1 transporters on the d-aspartate concentration is shown in Fig. 5A. It is inwardly rectifying and similar to that of wild-type EAAC-1 with or without MTSET treatment (data not shown). Also, the affinity of untreated I421C-EAAC-1 of ∼25 μm is similar to that of the wild type with or without the sulfhydryl reagent (data not shown) (19.Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). An analysis of thed-aspartate concentration dependence of the currents reveals that in MTSET-treated I421C, the apparent affinity for this substrate is lowered by almost 10 times as compared with the untreated mutant transporters (Fig. 5C). The Hill number ford-aspartate is not changed (Student's ttest at the 0.05 significance level): 1.1 ± 0.1 and 1.2 ± 0.2 at −100 and +40 mV, respectively, before treatment and 0.9 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.2 after treatment with MTSET. In both cases the apparent affinity is voltage-independent, at least at negative potentials where a direct comparison is feasible (Fig. 5C). We have taken advantage of the I421C mutant to address the question of whether (as is the case for coupled flux) multiple sodium ions are required to enable the substrate-gated anion conductance. To amplify the anion currents, 20 mm thiocyanate has been included in the perfusion medium, because its permeability is ∼70-fold larger than that of chloride (30.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 34.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6A illustrates the I/V plots of the d-aspartate (3 mm) net currents in MTSET-treated I421C-EAAC-1 transporters at varying sodium concentrations. Replotting these data versus the sodium concentration shows a cooperative behavior at all voltages tested (Fig. 6B). The sodium concentration, which gives rise to half-maximal currents, are similar (Student's t test at 0.05 significance level) at −100 mV and at +40 mV, namely 23.0 ± 0.4 and 23.3 ± 0.3 mm (n = 6), respectively. The same is true for the Hill numbers 3.0 ± 0.2 and 2.9 ± 0.1 at −100 and +40 mV, respectively (t test at 0.05 significance level). The data shown in Fig. 6, A andB, are normalized currents. An examination of the absolute net d-aspartate currents reveals the striking result that treatment with MTSET causes a marked stimulation of both inward and outward currents (Fig. 6C) as shown here at 96 mm sodium. At +40 and −100 mV, the increase is 4.43 ± 0.31- and 2.56 ± 0.17-fold, respectively (n = 6). This result indicates that when the anion conductance is the major component of the current, blocking the coupled cycle enables the transporter to reside longer in the conformation gating the anion conductance. Our studies show that in I421C-EAAC-1 transporters, which otherwise behave identical to wild-type EAAC-1, sulfhydryl reagents abolish the uptake of d-[3H]aspartate (Fig. 1) and modify the substrate-induced currents (Figs. 2 and 3). The characterization of those currents indicates that it is the coupled flux that is affected. Whereas this flux is completely absent, the substrate-gated anion conductance is not affected by the sulfhydryl reagents (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). We have used the mutant to study the anion conductance in isolation of the coupled current and obtained novel insights into the similarities and differences among these processes as well as their interrelation. Possible pathways connecting coupled and uncoupled fluxes are shown in Fig. 7. The sodium-coupled glutamate translocation with the participating potassium ion and proton omitted for simplicity is represented by steps 1–4. After the binding of sodium and glutamate on the extracellular side (step 1), the translocation complex is formed. After translocation (step 2), the substrates are released on the intracellular side (step 3). The unloaded transporter binds potassium (not shown), and after translocation to the outside (step 4), potassium is released and the transporter is ready to start a new cycle. Because glutamate as well as the other acidic amino acid substrates gate the uncoupled anion conductance in a sodium-dependent manner, most models (34.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) propose a transition step of the outward-facing substrate-loaded transporter to an anion-conducting state, outT*Na,Glu (Fig. 7,step A). According to this scenario, the modification of the cysteine introduced at position 421 may be explained by a perturbation of either steps 2 or 3. HeLa cells expressing mutants locked in the exchange mode in which step 4 is impaired selectively still exhibit normald-[3H]aspartate uptake (15.Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The complete inhibition of this uptake in I421C-EAAC-1 by MTSET (Fig. 1) renders selective inhibition of step 4 unlikely. The fact that the apparent affinity for d-aspartate to activate the anion conductance in I421C is almost 10-fold lower than that to activate the total current (Fig. 5C) can be easily accommodated by the alternative possibility depicted in Fig. 7, step B. According to this proposal, the anion-conducting stateoutT*Na,Glu can be reached without entering the coupled cycle. An inherent assumption is that the mutation has not somehow altered the apparent affinity of the uncoupled process ford-aspartate. Because the voltage dependence and thed-aspartate concentration dependence of the currents in the untreated mutant are identical to that of the wild type, it is likely that this assumption indeed is correct. Three sodium ions are translocated with glutamate in the coupled cycle (3.Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 16.Levy L.M. Warr D. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study of the uncoupled flux indicates that this process also may require multiple sodium ions (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, one possibility is that two or three sodium ions bind to the transporter, and subsequently the sodium-bound transporter binds glutamate and enters either the coupled cycle or the anion-conducting state. The role of the anion conductance has been postulated to counteract the depolarization caused by excessive glutamate flux (20.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). At high extracellular glutamate levels, the magnitude of this depolarization caused by the coupled process could be relatively large. Under these conditions, glutamate is likely to saturate the activation site of the anion conductance. Thus, at the same time, the influx of chloride will be activated, and this is expected to limit the depolarization. It is of interest that sulfhydryl modification of I421C also abolishes substrate-sensitive transient currents (Fig. 2). These transients probably represent voltage-dependent conformational changes associated with the coupled transport cycle but not those occurring during gating of the anion conductance. The idea that the activation of the anion conductance is separate from that of the coupled transport (Fig. 7, step B) is in harmony with several recent independent lines of evidence. Kinetic experiments indicate that the onset of the uncoupled current is delayed compared with that of the coupled current (35.Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37.Auger C. Attwell D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the two exhibit different pH profiles (38.Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and cation specificities (28.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been found that Zn2+ selectively perturbs the two processes. In the EAAT-1 transporter (the human homologue of glutamate/aspartate transporter-1), Zn2+ was found to inhibit the coupled but not the uncoupled current (39.Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the reverse is true for EAAT-4 (40.Mitrovic A.D. Plesko F. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26071-26076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The scheme shown in Fig. 7 indicates that regardless of which of the two events in fact takes place, the steps of the coupled flux should be in dynamic equilibrium with the conformation gating the anion conductance. Selective blockade of the coupled cycle at either step 2 or step 3 is expected to increase the probability of entering the anion-gating conformation. The experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 6support this idea. Upon modification of I421C with MTSET, the net outward d-aspartate currents emerge at positive potentials (Fig. 2). Before the addition of the sulfhydryl reagent, the current due to the coupled flux, which is inward even at +40 mV, is almost balanced by the outward current, which reflects the substrate-gated anion conductance (30.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Selective elimination of the coupled current by sulfhydryl reagents reveals the outward anion current. In the presence of the highly permeable thiocyanate, the contribution of the anion conductance to the total current is markedly increased. At positive potentials, this conductance becomes the major component of the total current even before the addition of MTSET (30.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 34.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Otis T.S.

A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The result of the sulfhydryl modification is >4-fold stimulation of the anion-current (Fig. 6C) because of the enhanced probability of entering the conformation gating the anion conductance. At potentials more negative than the reversal potential, the stimulation of the inward current after MTSET treatment is approximately 2.5-fold, because two events now take place. The coupled current, which contributes significantly to the inward current, is inhibited at the same time as the anion current is stimulated. Even though we have obtained new functional insights into coupled glutamate translocation and substrate-gated anion conductance, the structural basis of their possible interrelations remains unclear. Our observations that the modification of a cysteine residue introduced in the hydrophobic linker region selectively inhibits coupled flux suggest that this region may be less important for the activation of the anion conductance. It has been suggested that the same translocation pathway is used for both processes (30.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). An alternative speculation is that the coupled glutamate flux occurs within a glutamate transporter monomer, whereas the anion-conducting pathway is formed in the space among the monomers in a pentameric structure (41.Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). If the latter idea is correct, one way to identify the chloride-conducting pathway may be to search for residues that participate in the formation of interfaces between monomers. Two groups have also documented that sulfhydryl modification of cysteine replacement mutants of the related human glutamate transporter EAAT-1 results in the elimination of the coupled flux but not the uncoupled process. In one report (42.Seal R.P. Shigeri Y. Eliasof S. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the cysteine was introduced at a position corresponding to residue 417 of EAAC-1, and in the other report (43.Ryan R.M. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13494-13500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the cysteine replacement was at a position corresponding to EAAC-1 residue 420.

https://openalex.org/W2318262155,"Cell cycle control, faithful DNA replication, repair and recombination are associated in a network of pathways controlling genome maintenance. In mammalian cells, inhibition of replication produces DNA breaks and induces RAD51-dependent recombination, in a late step. Here we examine whether the status of p53 affects this process in mouse L-cells containing a recombination substrate. We show that expression of the mutant His175p53 strongly stimulates recombination induced by aphidicolin, in a late step (kinetically related to the RAD51 step). Mutant p53 stimulates recombination induced by the replication elongation inhibitors (aphidicolin, hydroxyurea and Ara-C) but is without effect on recombination induced by the initiation inhibitors (mimosine and ciclopirox olamine). We compared the impact of several p53 mutations showing different effects on the G1 checkpoint and on recombination. We show that the mutant Pro273p53 protein, which does not alter the G1 checkpoint, strongly stimulates recombination induced by elongation inhibitors. These results show that p53 can act on recombination induced by replication arrest independently of its role in the G1 checkpoint. An action of p53 via the RAD51 pathway is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2048600400,"Dinitrogenase is a heterotetrameric (α2β2) enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonium and contains the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) at its active site.

The γ protein is able to bind FeMo-co or apodinitrogenase independently, leading to the suggestion that it facilitates FeMo-co insertion into the apoenzyme. In this work, the non-nif gene encoding the γ subunit (nafY) has been cloned, sequenced, and found to encode a NifY-like protein. This finding, together with a wealth of knowledge on the biochemistry of proteins involved in FeMo-co and FeV-co biosyntheses, allows us to define a new family of iron and molybdenum (or vanadium) cluster-binding proteins that includes NifY, NifX, VnfX, and now γ. In vitro FeMo-co insertion experiments presented in this work demonstrate that γ stabilizes apodinitrogenase in the conformation required to be fully activable by the cofactor. Supporting this conclusion, we show that strains containing mutations in both nafY and nifX are severely affected in diazotrophic growth and extractable dinitrogenase activity when cultured under conditions that are likely to occur in natural environments. This finding reveals the physiological importance of the apodinitrogenase-stabilizing role of which both proteins are capable.

Nitrogenase catalyzes the reduction of nitrogen gas to ammonium, in an ATP- and reductant-dependent reaction. It is one of the best characterized metalloenzymes and is an excellent model for elucidating metalloprotein assembly. Nitrogenase is composed of two oxygen-labile metalloproteins: dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase (1.Bulen W.A. LeComte J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dinitrogenase (also termed component I or molybdenum-iron protein) is a 240-kDa α2β2tetramer of the nifD and nifK gene products (3.Kim J. Rees D.C.

Imperial J. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 888-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the products of at least seven nitrogen fixation (nif) genes, nifB,nifE, nifH, nifN, nifQ,nifV, and nifX, are involved in the biosynthesis of FeMo-co (8.Shah V.K. Rangaraj P.

Azotobacter vinelandii or Klebsiella pneumoniae strains with mutations in nifB,nifN, or nifE produce a FeMo-co-deficient hexameric (α2β2γ2) apodinitrogenase that can be activated in vitro by the simple addition of purified FeMo-co (9.Paustian T.D.

On the other hand, apodinitrogenase from ΔnifH mutants has a tetrameric composition (α2β2) and requires some type of NifH- and MgATP-dependent maturation that, in turn, promotes the association of the γ subunit and leads to the form that is competent for FeMo-co activation (11.Robinson A.C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies on crude extracts of an A. vinelandii nifB mutant demonstrated that the γ protein specifically binds to free FeMo-co and to apodinitrogenase, consistent with a role in FeMo-co insertion (13.Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However Christiansen et al. (14.Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have reported that pure preparations of His-tagged apodinitrogenase from a nifB mutant strain lacked the γ subunit but still could be activated to 80% of the theoretical value by the simple addition of FeMo-co, which suggests a role for γ other than that of a FeMo-co insertase. As they pointed out, the solution to this controversy would require the inactivation of the γ gene. In K. pneumoniae the third subunit in the hexameric apodinitrogenase is the product of the nifY gene (10.Homer M.J. Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. J.

However, this is not the case in A. vinelandii, where the γ-encoding gene is not in the nif gene clusters. AlthoughA. vinelandii contains a nifY gene there is no mutant phenotype associated with its inactivation (16.Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J.

In vivo andin vitro results presented here indicate that γ stabilizes apodinitrogenase in an open (FeMo-co activable) conformation; by contrast, our results do not support a role for γ as an essential FeMo-co insertase.

Strain UW45 (nifB) has been described previously (17.Joerger R.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth in the presence of molybdate, nifderepression, and cell breakage have been described (18.Shah V.K. Davis L.C. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys.

For growth on plates, the medium was solidified with separately autoclaved 1.5% agar solution. 0.5 μg/ml kanamycin, 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml spectinomycin, and 5 μg/ml rifampin were added as required.Escherichia coli DH5α was grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). For growth of E. coli on plates, medium solidified with 1.5% agar was used. Antibiotics were used at standard concentrations (19.Ausubel F.N. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

For growth rate determinations, strains were grown at 30 °C on Burk's modified medium (designated as standard growth conditions) or at 37 °C on Burk's modified medium not supplemented with molybdate (designated as stressing growth conditions). When a fixed nitrogen source was required, ammonium acetate was added to a final concentration of 29 mm. Growth was estimated from the absorbance of the cultures at 600 nm, using a Shimadzu UV1201V spectrophotometer. The growth rate constant corresponds to ln2/td, where tdrepresents the doubling time. The N-terminal amino acid sequence for γ (VTPVNMSRETALRIALAARALPGTTVGQLL) was obtained from a preparation of partially purified α2β2γ2 apodinitrogenase (see below). Degenerate oligonucleotides 5′-GTNACNCCNGTNATCATG-3′ and 5′-CTGICCIACGGTGGTICCIGG-3′ were designed, based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence, and were used as primers in a PCR to amplify an 81-bp DNA fragment from the chromosome of A. vinelandii. After sequencing the 81-bp fragment, oligonucleotides 5′-CGCCCTGGCTGCCAGGGCTTTG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 42–63 with respect to the translation start of the γ gene, termednafY for nitrogenase accessoryfactor Y) and 5′-ATGCGCAGAGCGGTTTCGCGAC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 41–20 with respect to the translation start of nafY) were used as primers in a reverse PCR.SalI-digested and religated chromosomic DNA from A. vinelandii was used as template for this reaction. A 1.5-kbp PCR product was obtained, ligated into pGEM-T, sequenced, and digested withBglII and SalI to generate a 1,236-bp DNA fragment that was finally ligated into pUK21 to render plasmid pRHB20. Plasmid pRHB20 contains sequences 5′ of nafY from theA. vinelandii chromosome. A. vinelandii strain UW139 was generated by transforming DJ strain with plasmid pRHB20 and selecting for single recombinants on plates containing ammonium acetate- and kanamycin-supplemented Burk's medium. Genomic DNA from strain UW139 was digested with either BamHI orXhoI, religated, and used to transform E. coliDH5α, rendering plasmids pRHB21 and pRHB24, respectively. Plasmid pRHB21 contains ≈14 kbp of A. vinelandii DNA sequences 5′ of nafY, whereas plasmid pRHB24 contains 1.2 kbp of sequences 5′ of nafY along with nafY and ≈16 kbp of 3′-sequences (see Fig. 1). Plasmid constructions, PCR, and transformation of E. coli were carried out by standard methods (19.Ausubel F.N. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York2000Google Scholar). A computer search for homologies was made using the BLAST algorithm (20.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Isolation of DNA from A. vinelandii strains was carried out using the DNAeasyTMTissue Kit (Qiagen). For isolation of RNA,A. vinelandii strains grown in modified Burk's medium containing fixed nitrogen (29 mm ammonium acetate) were derepressed for nitrogenase as described (21.Jacobson M.R. Premakumar R. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 480-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of RNA fromA. vinelandii strains was performed using the RNeasyTM Midi Kit (Qiagen). For Northern analysis, 10-μg portions of RNA samples were electrophoresed in a denaturing formaldehyde gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Millipore). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C. A PCR-amplified DNA fragment, covering the entire nafY, was used as probe after labeling with Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene) and [α-32P]dCTP. Procedures for A. vinelandii transformation (22.Page W.J. von Tigerstrom M. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and gene replacement (23.Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) have been described. Plasmid pRHB25 contains a 3.4-BglII DNA fragment from plasmid pRHB24 which includes a portion of rnfH,nafY, and additional 3′-sequences. Plasmids pRHB29a and pRHB29b were generated by substitution of a kanamycin resistance cassette for a 231-bp SalI fragment within nafYin plasmid pRHB25. The kanamycin resistance gene in the cassette, obtained from plasmid pUC4K, was in the same orientation asnafY in plasmid pRHB29a and in the opposite orientation fromnafY in plasmid pRHB29b. UW146 was generated by transformation of strain UW45 with plasmid pRHB29b. Strains UW141, UW147, and UW154 were generated by transformation of strains DJ, DJ166, and DJ208 with plasmid pRHB29a, respectively, followed by selection of a Kanr phenotype. Plasmid pRHB28 was generated after removing the 231-bp SalI fragment from pRHB25 described above, to produce an in-frame deletion within nafY. Strains UW149, UW156, and UW158 were generated by transformation of strains UW141, UW154 and UW147 with plasmid pRHB28, respectively, and scored for the Kans phenotype. UW166 was generated by transformation of UW156 with plasmid pRHB44a, which containsnifX disrupted by an insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette at the internal Eco47III site to nifX. The kanamycin resistance gene in the cassette, obtained from plasmid pUC4K, was in the same orientation as nifX. Plasmid pRHB42 contains a 1.5-kbp SalI fragment from pRHB24 which includes a portion of rnfG along with rnfE,rnfH, and a portion of nafY. Plasmid pRHB43 was generated by insertion of the Ω interposon, from plasmid pHP45Ω, into the unique BglII site within rnfH in pRHB42. UW165 was generated by transformation of strain DJ with plasmid pRHB43. All generated mutations were checked by PCR to confirm that double recombination and segregation events occurred. Dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase activities in cell-free extracts were obtained after titration with an excess of the complementary component as described (24.Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The specific activity of each protein is defined as nmol of ethylene formed/min/mg of protein. FeMo-co was prepared inN-methylformamide as described (25.Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). 9-ml serum vials were evacuated and flushed repeatedly with purified argon and rinsed with anaerobic 25 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The following were then added to the vials: 100 μl of Tris·HCl buffer, 200 μl of UW45 or UW146 cell-free extracts (≈3 mg of protein), and 2 or 10 μl of a solution containing FeMo-co (equivalent to 0.1 and 0.5 nmol of Mo, respectively). The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C after which 0.8 ml of ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mm ATP, 6.3 mm MgCl2, 51 mm phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mm sodium dithionite) and an excess of purified NifH (0.2 mg of protein) were added. Nitrogenase activity was then quantitated by acetylene reduction as described (26.Shah V.K. Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Brill W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3891-3894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the in vitro FeMo-co insertion time course experiments, 21-ml serum vials were evacuated and flushed repeatedly with purified argon and rinsed with anaerobic Tris·HCl buffer. The following were then added to the vials: 0.7 ml of Tris·HCl buffer, 1.4 ml of UW45 or UW146 cell-free extracts (≈21 mg of protein), and 70 μl of a solution containing FeMo-co (equivalent to 3.5 nmol of molybdenum). The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and 0.2-ml aliquots were removed at different times and injected into anaerobic 9-ml serum vials containing 40 nmol of (NH4)2MoS4 to prevent further insertion of FeMo-co into apodinitrogenase. The vials were incubated for at least 10 min at room temperature, and 0.8 ml of ATP-regenerating mixture and an excess of purified NifH (0.2 mg of protein) were added. Nitrogenase activity was then quantitated by acetylene reduction as described (26.Shah V.K. Ugalde R.A. Imperial J. Brill W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3891-3894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for SDS-PAGE has been described (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described by Brandner et al. (28.Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donohue T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A preparation of partially purified hexameric apodinitrogenase (α2β2γ2) from strain UW45, containing about 12 μg of protein, was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The γ protein band was excised from the membrane and used for N-terminal sequence at the Protein/Peptide Micro Analytical Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. Protein Assays—Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard (29.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). A combination of PCR and reverse PCR techniques was used to isolate the gene encoding γ from A. vinelandiigenomic DNA (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). The cloning procedure resulted in the recovery of plasmids pRHB21 and pRHB24. pRHB21 contains ≈14 kbp of A. vinelandii DNA sequence 5′ of the γ-encoding gene (nafY), whereas pRHB24 contains 1.2 kbp of sequence 5′ of nafY along withnafY and ≈16 kbp of 3′-sequences (Fig. 1). Sequencing of the 1.2-kbpSalI-BglII fragment located 5′ of nafYrevealed the presence of three ORFs, designated ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3, which would encode polypeptides showing homology to RnfG, RnfE, and RnfH polypeptides from Rhodobacter capsulatus, respectively (30.Schmehl M. Jahn A. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Hennecke S. Masepohl B. Schuppler M. Marxer M. Oelze J. Klipp W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 602-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In R. capsulatus, the Rnf polypeptides are requiredin vivo for nitrogen fixation and are proposed to constitute a membrane complex involved in electron transport to nitrogenase (30.Schmehl M. Jahn A. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Hennecke S. Masepohl B. Schuppler M. Marxer M. Oelze J. Klipp W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 602-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,31.Kumagai H. Fujiwara T. Matsubara H. Saeki K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5509-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, rnf genes and nafY are clustered in the A. vinelandii chromosome (Fig. 1). No other ORFs were found in the 500 bp 3′ of nafY in plasmid pRHB24, strongly suggesting that nafY is the last gene of the cluster. Fig. 2 compares the amino acid sequences of γ with some γ homologs found in protein data bases. It is clear thatnafY encodes a protein that is similar to NifY, NifX, VnfX, and the C-terminal half of NifB from A. vinelandii and other bacterial sources. The actual role of NifY in the A. vinelandii nif system is not known. However, K. pneumoniae NifY is found instead of γ as the third subunit in the hexameric apodinitrogenase (10.Homer M.J. Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4907-4910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.White T.C. Harris G.S. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24007-24016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NifX and VnfX are proteins involved in the biosyntheses of FeMo-co and FeV-co, respectively (8.Shah V.K. Rangaraj P. Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Rüttimann-Johnson C. Staples C.R. Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18087-18092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). FeV-co is an iron-vanadium cofactor contained in the vnf-encoded dinitrogenase and functions analogously to FeMo-co of the molybdenum system (33.Robson R.L. Eady R.R. Richardson T.H. Miller R.W. Hawkins M. Postgate J.R. Nature. 1986; 322: 388-390Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar). NifB is required for the three nitrogenase systems (molybdenum-, vanadium-, and iron-only-containing nitrogenases) (34.Bishop P.E. Joerger R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 109-125Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and its role may be the synthesis of NifB-co, an iron-sulfur cluster that serves as precursor for FeMo-co, FeV-co, and FeFe-co biosyntheses (35.Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence identity between nifY and nifXgene products from A. vinelandii and K. pneumoniae have been noted before (16.Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no functional relationships could be inferred at that time. When sequence identity between NifY/NifX and NifB proteins was noted, a role for NifY/NifX proteins in FeMo-co maturation or stabilization was suggested based on the known role of NifB in FeMo-co biosynthesis (36.Moreno-Vivian C. Schmehl M. Masepohl B. Arnold W. Klipp W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the most similar protein in data bases is the recently reported product of a nifY-like gene in the bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri (GenBank accession no. AJ297529). The physical organization of the rnf region in P. stutzeri(rnfCDGEH-nifY-like-ORF13-ORF12-nifH) somewhat resembles the A. vinelandii organization, where two separate rnfGEH-nafY (this work) and ORF13-ORF12-nifH regions have been found (GenBank accession no. AF014048). Although it is reasonable to believe that there might be a physical linkage between the two regions in the A. vinelandii chromosome, this is unlikely because we have not been able to complement the mutation in A. vinelandii strain DJ54 (ΔnifH) by transformation with plasmids pRHB21 or pRHB24. Consistent with the sequence similarity among γ, NifY, NifX, and VnfX polypeptides, in vitro studies provide supporting evidence that they are functionally related because they are able to interact with some intermediates of the FeMo-co or FeV-co biosynthetic pathways. First, the γ protein binds FeMo-co (13.Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Second, NifX and VnfX fromA. vinelandii are also able to bind FeMo-co (37.Rangaraj P. Ruttimann-Johnson C. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15968-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 2P. J. Goodwin, D. R. Dean, and C. Rüttimann-Johnson, personal communications. as well as NifB-co (32.Rüttimann-Johnson C. Staples C.R. Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18087-18092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,37.Rangaraj P. Ruttimann-Johnson C. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15968-15974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Third, VnfX is also able to bind a FeV-co precursor (vanadium-containing iron-sulfur cluster) lacking homocitrate (32.Rüttimann-Johnson C. Staples C.R. Rangaraj P. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18087-18092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that γ, NifY, NifX, and VnfX constitute a family of iron and molybdenum (or vanadium) cluster-binding proteins. It has been reported that the rnf gene cluster from R. capsulatus is subject to nif regulation and that their products are required in vivo for nitrogen fixation (30.Schmehl M. Jahn A. Meyer zu Vilsendorf A. Hennecke S. Masepohl B. Schuppler M. Marxer M. Oelze J. Klipp W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 602-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, nothing is known about regulation of the expression of thernf gene cluster in A. vinelandii, but it is known that γ (NafY) is not the product of a nif gene, nor is it nif coregulated (13.Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because rnfH andnafY are clustered in the A. vinelandiichromosome, having an intergenic region of only 24 bp, we wondered whether they are cotranscribed. As a preliminary approach to address this question, the Ω interposon was inserted into theBglII site located within rnfH to generate a polar mutation (Fig. 1). The Ω interposon carries transcriptional terminators and has been shown to impair gene expression from promoters 5′ of the site of Ω insertion in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria (38.Frey J. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 36: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Crude extracts were prepared fromnif-derepressed cells of wild-type and mutant strain UW165 (rnfH::Ω) and analyzed by immunoblot of an SDS-gel developed with antibody to γ (Fig. 3). The presence of γ in the extracts of strain UW165 suggests that a promoter 3′ of the Ω interposon insertion site is driving nafY expression. However, the 80-bp region between the Ω insertion site and the nafYstart codon lacks any obvious promoter sequences and is unable to promote γ accumulation when present in a plasmid in E. coli (data not shown). Given the substantial amount of γ protein that A. vinelandii cells are able to accumulate (9.Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3515-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13.Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the lack of an obvious promoter sequence 5′ of nafY is unexpected; nevertheless the result still suggests independent regulation of rnfH and nafY. In addition, a ≈1.1-kb RNA species was identified by Northern analysis using a nafY probe (Fig. 4). The observed transcript is of sufficient length to encode the whole NafY and is present in both ammonium-grown and nif-derepressed cells (compare lanes 1 and2), although it appears to be more abundant innif-derepressed cells. Consistent with the immunoblot results, cells from strain UW165 (rnfH::Ω,lanes 3 and 4) also contain the 1.1-kbnafY transcript, indicating independent transcription fromrnfH. Our Northern analysis does not, however, rule out the presence of additional longer transcripts that could cover part or the whole rnf-nafY cluster. The nafY gene was mutated by creation of a nonpolar in-frame deletion, termed ΔnafY, and the mutation was transferred to the chromosome of A. vinelandii wild-type strain to generate strain UW149 (see “Experimental Procedures”)."
https://openalex.org/W2094912911,"Previous studies have indicated an important role for the Raf family of protein kinases in controlling cellular responses to extracellular stimuli and activated oncogenes, through their ability to activate the MEK/ERKs. To investigate the specific role of A-Raf in this process we generated A-Raf deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and embryonic stem (ES) cells by gene targeting and characterized their ability to undergo proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, ERK activation, and transformation by oncogenic Ras and Src. The A-Raf deficient cells are not disrupted for any of these processes, despite the fact that this protein is normally expressed at high levels in both cell types. This implies either that A-Raf plays no role in MEK/ERK activation, that its function is fully compensated by other Raf proteins or MEK kinases or that its role in MEK/ERK activation is highly tissue-specific. Interestingly, B-Raf and Raf-1 activity towards MEK as measured by the immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay are both significantly increased in the A-Raf deficient MEFs."
https://openalex.org/W2094543097,"Oxalate, a metabolic end product, is an important factor in the pathogenesis of renal stone disease. Oxalate exposure to renal epithelial cells results in re-initiation of the DNA synthesis, altered gene expression, and apoptosis, but the signaling pathways involved in these diverse effects have not been evaluated. The effects of oxalate on mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways were studied in LLC-PK1 cells. Exposure to oxalate (1 mm) rapidly stimulated robust phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK. Oxalate exposure also induced modest activation of JNK, as monitored by phosphorylation of c-Jun. In contrast, oxalate exposure had no effect on phosphorylation and enzyme activity of p42/44 MAPK. We also show that specific inhibition of p38 MAPK by 4(4-(fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole (SB203580) or by overexpression of a kinase-dead dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK abolishes oxalate induced re-initiation of DNA synthesis in LLC-PK1 cells. The inhibition is dose-dependent and correlates with in situactivity of native p38 MAP kinase, determined as MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 activity in cell extracts. Thus, this study not only provides the first demonstration of selective activation of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways by oxalate but also suggests that p38 MAPK activity is essential for the effects of oxalate on re-initiation of DNA synthesis.

Several parallel MAP kinase signal transduction pathways have been defined in mammalian cells. These pathways include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK, also known as p42/44 MAP kinase), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as SAPK1), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAP kinase, also known as SAPK-2/reactivating kinase/CSBP/HOG1/Mxi2/p40/Phh/Spc1/Sty1/XMpk2). The stress and mitogen-activated protein kinase (SAPK and MAPK) pathways play critical roles in responding to cellular stress and promoting cell growth and survival (20.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 21.Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of oxalate on MAP kinase signaling pathways. Five homologous subfamilies of MAPKs and SAPKs have been identified thus far. The three major families include p42/p44 MAPKs/ERKs, JNK/SAPK1, and p38 MAPK/SAPK2 kinase. The p38 MAP kinase is a mammalian homologue of yeast HOG kinase and participates in a cascade controlling cellular responses to stress and cytokines (23.Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J.

The prototypical MAP kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 are defined by motif TEY in the activation domain (26.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The second subtype JNK/SAPK1 is characterized by the sequence TPY in the activation domain (27.Kyriakis J.M.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), whereas the third, p38/SAPK2/reactivating kinase, has the motif TGY in the activation domain (23.Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). These subtypes may be activated in parallel but to a distinct extent by different stimuli (28.Blink Bd B.

In general stress-activated protein kinases are activated primarily when cells are exposed to various kinds of stresses such as osmotic stress, inflammatory cytokines, ultraviolet light, and high temperature shock (27.Kyriakis J.M.

However, increasing evidence suggests that, at least under certain conditions, these pathways can also be activated by mitogenic factors (33.Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, p42/p44 MAP kinases are primarily stimulated by mitogenic factors, although these kinases can also be activated under certain stress conditions (34.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol.

LLC-PK1 cells, a line of porcine kidney epithelial cells with characteristics of the S1–S3 segment of proximal tubular epithelium, have been used widely as an in vitro model of renal epithelial cells (36.Takakura Y.

It has been shown that LLC-PK1 cells are sensitive to oxalate and provide a useful system to study the effects of oxalate on re-initiation of the DNA synthesis, early growth-responsive gene expression, cell growth, and death (10.Koul H.

Previously, we demonstrated that oxalate exposure to renal epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) in culture results in the re-initiation of DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and cell death depending on the levels of oxalate (10.Koul H. Renzulli L. Nair G. Honeyman T. Menon M. Schied C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, the exact signal transduction pathways for diverse actions of oxalate are not understood. In this study we used this cell line to investigate the effects of oxalate on SAPK and MAPK signaling pathways. We show that oxalate selectively, rapidly, and robustly activates p38 MAP kinase, causes a mild activation of JNK/SAPK, and does not activate the ERK group of MAP kinases in renal epithelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase in particular is most strongly targeted by oxalate and that p38 MAP kinase activity is essential for the effects of oxalate on re-initiation of DNA synthesis. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and myelin basic protein (MBP) were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies against phospho- and total p38 MAP kinase and phospho- and total c-Jun were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against p42/44 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Los Angeles, CA). GST c-Jun-(1–79) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. MAPKAP kinase-2 assay kit was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Goat anti-rabbit IgGs and goat anti-mouse IgGs were obtained from Kodak Biolabs Scientific Imaging systems (Rochester, NY). Recombinant protein A-agarose, leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and SB203580 were purchased from Sigma. Anisomycin was purchased fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem. ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [3H]thymidine was obtained from ICN Radiochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). ImmobilonTM-P membrane was obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The expression vector pCMV-p38 (AGF) (dominant negative mutant of p38 MAPK) was a generous gift from Dr. Roger J. Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). All chemicals were analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma. LLC-PK1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), grown on polystyrene (Corning Glass) T-75 flasks, were used between passages 216 and 240. The cells were serially passaged in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For transfections, LLC-PK1 cells were grown in 6-well plates to 60% confluency and were transiently transfected with control vector (pCMV Tag 5) or kinase-dead dominant negative construct pCMV-p38 (AGF) using LipoTAXI transfection reagent (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were allowed to grow to confluence prior to use in experiments. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Sodium oxalate was added at a concentration of 1 mm, wherever indicated. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was used as an index of cell proliferation and was carried out as described previously (10.Koul H. Renzulli L. Nair G. Honeyman T. Menon M. Schied C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, LLC-PK1 cells were plated at a high density in 6-well plates and grown to confluence. These cells were serum-starved for 12–18 h and pre-exposed to various concentrations of SB203580 (0.5-100 μm) for 1 h before addition of oxalate (1 mm) for 24 h. In some experiments, cells were transfected with control vector (pCMV Tag 5) or kinase-dead dominant negative expression vector pCMV-p38 (AGF) and were grown to confluence. These cells were serum-starved for 12–18 h before exposure to oxalate (1 mm) for 24 h. During last 6 h of exposure 2–3 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added per well. At the end of experimental period, cells were washed with two changes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinized for 30–45 min at 37 °C. Two ml of cell suspension was combined with 2 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the acid-insoluble material was collected on Whatman glass fiber filters. Filters were then air-dried, and the radioactivity was counted using a Beckman Liquid Scintillation Counter (LS 6500). Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and were serum-starved for 12–18 h. These growth-arrested cells were exposed for various time points (0–240 min) to oxalate (1 mm). Where indicated, cells were exposed to anisomycin (10 μg/ml), UV, or EGF (50 ng/ml) for appropriate positive controls. At the end of experimental periods, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were sonicated for 1 s with a micro-ultrasonic cell disrupter and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) method, and gel samples were prepared by adding 2× sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue) and boiling for 3–5 min. Samples containing 50–100 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane using standard electroblotting procedures. The membranes were blocked with 2% blocking solution (Eastman Kodak) in TBST (Tris, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were immunolabeled overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies that equally recognize phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK (1:1000) or with an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-MAPK (1:1000). The phosphorylation state of JNK/SAPK was evaluated using an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser63–Ser73c-Jun or an antibody that equally recognizes phosphorylated and unphosphorylated c-Jun. Similarly, the phosphorylation state of p38 MAP kinase was evaluated using an antibody that specifically recognizes dual phosphorylation motif at Thr180 and Tyr182 of p38 MAP kinase (1:1500) or with an antibody that equally recognizes phosphorylated and dephosphorylated p38 MAP kinase (1:3000). Immunoblots were washed with several changes of TBST at room temperature and then incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Kodak). Immunoreactivity was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Kodak) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol and quantified using densitometric analysis (Stratagene Eagles EyeTM II). For these assays, cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and were serum-starved for 12–18 h. Cells were exposed for various time points (0–60 min) to oxalate (1 mm). Where indicated, cells were exposed to anisomycin (10 μg/ml), UV, or EGF (50 ng/ml) for appropriate positive controls. These cells were then solubilized with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of ERK, JNK, or p38 MAP kinase was achieved by adding 0.5 μg of anti-ERK-2, 1 μg of anti-JNK, or 0.5 μg of anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody, respectively, to cell lysate containing 500 μg of total cellular protein and rocking at 4 °C for 2–4 h. 50 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension of recombinant protein A-agarose beads was then added, and the reaction slurry was allowed to rock at 4 °C for 8–12 h. The immunoprecipitation complexes were washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and five times with kinase assay buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase assay reactions consisted of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and either 10 μg of MBP for p38 MAP kinase and p42/p44 MAP kinase or 1 μg of GST c-Jun-(1–79) for JNK assay, in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min with shaking. Reactions were stopped by 2 min of centrifugation at 14,000 × g, and supernatant was suspended in 2× Laemmli SDS-sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue. Samples were boiled for 2 min and run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAPK or on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for JNK enzyme activity. Kinase activity was measured as the amount of 32P incorporation into specific substrate proteins. These enzyme assays were carried out as described previously (41.Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19834-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. Serum-starved cells were exposed to oxalate (1 mm) for various time points between 0 and 60 min. In some experiments, cells were pretreated for 1 h with various concentrations of SB203580 (0.5–30 μm) or the cells were transfected with control vector (pCMV Tag 5) or kinase-dead dominant negative expression vector pCMV-p38 (AGF) before exposure to oxalate. At the end of the treatment period, cells were harvested by scraping in 0.5 ml of an ice-cold non-denaturing lysis buffer A containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g to remove Triton-insoluble material. Aliquots containing 0.5 mg of total protein were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-MAPKAP kinase-2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) coupled to recombinant protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). The protein A-agarose enzyme immunocomplex was washed with 500 μl of non-denaturing lysis buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl followed by 500 μl of non-denaturing lysis buffer A and then finally with 100 μl of ice-cold assay dilution buffer (20 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol) solution. The MAPKAP kinase-2 enzyme activity was then assayed in an immunocomplex kinase assay using a specific MAPKAP kinase-2 substrate peptide (KKLNRTLSVA) from a MAPKAP kinase-2 immunoprecipitation kinase kit, as described in the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, beads were supplemented with 10 μl of ice-cold assay dilution buffer solution, 10 μl of 1 mm MAPKAP kinase-2 substrate peptide solution, and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/assay, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) diluted to 1 μCi/μl with magnesium and ATP mixture (75 mm magnesium chloride and 500 μm ATP) in each tube containing immunocomplex-formed beads, in a final volume of 50 μl. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. At the end of the experimental period, tubes were spun down, and 25 μl of the supernatant were spotted onto the center of 2 × 2 cm p81 phosphocellulose discs. The discs were washed three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid (v/v) and once with acetone. Radioactivity associated with the discs was counted by liquid scintillation counting and used as an index of 32P incorporated into the substrate peptide (KKLNRTLSVA). The counts/min of enzyme samples was compared with counts/min of control samples that contained no enzyme (background control). For these studies, LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to DMEM alone or in combination with oxalate (1 mm) for various times (5–60 min) or to anisomycin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min. At the end of experimental periods, whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with an antibody specific for phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase. Phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase is considered essential for its enzyme activity. As can be seen from the Fig. 1A, exposure to oxalate progressively induced phospho-p38 MAP kinase immunoreactivity. These blots were then stripped and re-probed with an antibody that equally recognizes phosphorylated as well as unphosphorylated p38 MAP kinase,i.e. total p38 MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 1B,oxalate exposure did not alter the total amount of p38 MAP kinase protein. Maximum activation of p38 occurred at about 30 min of oxalate exposure with an average 4.6-fold increase in p38 MAP kinase phospho-immunoreactivity (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase is activated by oxalate. To characterize further the effects of oxalate on p38 MAP kinase enzyme activity, LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to DMEM alone or in combination with oxalate (1 mm) for various times (5–30 min). p38 MAP kinase was then immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes total p38 MAP kinase (phosphorylated as well as unphosphorylated), and immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1D, oxalate robustly stimulated p38 MAP kinase activity within 30 min of exposure. It can be seen in Fig. 1E that the effect of oxalate on p38 MAP kinase is most robust at 30 min (average 7.4-fold activation over control). Some concerns have been raised that in vitro examination of p38 MAP kinase activity may not reflect its in situactivity. Thus in order to examine the specificity of oxalate exposure on the activity of p38 MAP kinase, LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to DMEM alone or in combination with oxalate (1 mm) for 30 and 60 min, and cell lysates were prepared for determination of native MAPKAP kinase-2 activity. It is important to point out here that p38 MAP kinase is the only known activator of MAPKAP kinase-2, and the activity of MAPKAP kinase-2 is dependent on its phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase (42.Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, in vitro activity of immunoprecipitated MAPKAP kinase-2 reflects the in situactivity of p38 MAP kinase. Results presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that oxalate-induced MAPKAP kinase-2 activity followed an activation pattern similar to that of p38 MAP kinase with maximal activation at 30 min following oxalate exposure. These data demonstrate that the rapid and robust activation of p38 MAP kinase by oxalate correlates with the in situactivity of MAPKAP kinase-2. Next we evaluated the effect of oxalate on JNK, the major SAPK. LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to oxalate for various times (0–60 min) or to UV for 30 min, and JNK enzyme activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oxalate exposure resulted in time-dependent increase in immunoreactivity of c-Jun (Fig. 3A). We also observed a mild phosphorylation at Ser73 of c-Jun during the times tested (Fig. 3, B and C). However, we could not detect phosphorylation at Ser63 (data not shown). These data demonstrate that oxalate exposure results in increased immunoreactivity of the transcription factor c-Jun. However, unlike its effects on p38 MAP kinase, oxalate exposure resulted only in a modest increase in JNK activity as compared with UV exposure. To characterize further the effects of oxalate on JNK/SAPK1 enzyme activity, LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to oxalate (1 mm) for various times (5–30 min). JNK/SAPK1 was then immunoprecipitated with an antibody that recognizes total JNK/SAPK1 (phosphorylated as well as unphosphorylated), and immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3D oxalate had only modest effect on JNK/SAPK1 activity within these time points. It can be seen in Fig. 3E that the effect of oxalate on JNK/SAPK1 was mild (1.8–2.2-fold over control) as compared with strong stimulation of JNK/SAPK1 by UV exposure (∼4.5-fold over contro"
https://openalex.org/W2312687639,"Oncostatin M (OSM), an interleukin-6 type cytokine, acts via the gp130 signaling receptor to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of breast cancer cells. EGF, a mitogen for breast cells, signals via EGFR/ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors which are implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis. Here we show paradoxically that EGF enhanced the OSM-induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of cellular differentiation in both estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancer cells. This functional synergism was also seen with heregulin but not SCF, PDGF or IGF-1, indicating that it was specific to EGF-related growth factors. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that gp130 was constitutively associated with ErbB-2 and ErbB-3. There was a similar association between the OSMRbeta and ErbB-2. Furthermore, EGF unexpectedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130. We show that OSM induced phosphorylation of STAT3. Both OSM and EGF activated the p42/44 MAP kinases, but while the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, ablated the OSM-induced inhibition, it only partially ablated the inhibitory effects of OSM plus EGF. Thus, we have demonstrated that the receptors and signalling pathways of two apparently unrelated growth factors were intimately linked, resulting in an unexpected biological effect. This provides a new mechanism for generating signalling diversity and has potential clinical implications in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2015510614,"α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) and its receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), function together to facilitate the cellular uptake and degradation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). In this study, we demonstrate that Aβ binds selectively to α2M that has been induced to undergo conformational change by reaction with methylamine. Denatured α2M subunits, which were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, bound Aβ, suggesting that α2M tertiary and quaternary structure are not necessary. To determine whether a specific sequence in α2M is responsible for Aβ binding, we prepared and analyzed defined α2M fragments and glutathione S-transferase-α2M peptide fusion proteins. A single sequence, centered at amino acids (aa) 1314–1365, was identified as the only major Aβ-binding site. Importantly, Aβ did not bind to the previously characterized growth factor-binding site (aa 718–734). Although the Aβ binding sequence is adjacent to the binding site for LRP, the results of experiments with mutated fusion proteins indicate that the two sites are distinct. Furthermore, a saturating concentration of Aβ did not inhibit LRP-mediated clearance of α2M-MA in mice. Using various methods, we determined that the KD for the interaction of Aβ with its binding site in the individual α2M subunit is 0.7–2.4 μm. The capacity of α2M to bind Aβ and deliver it to LRP may be greater than that predicted by the KD, because each α2M subunit may bind Aβ and the bound Aβ may multimerize. These studies suggest a model in which α2M has three protein interaction sites with distinct specificities, mediating the interaction with Aβ, growth factors, and LRP. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) and its receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), function together to facilitate the cellular uptake and degradation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). In this study, we demonstrate that Aβ binds selectively to α2M that has been induced to undergo conformational change by reaction with methylamine. Denatured α2M subunits, which were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, bound Aβ, suggesting that α2M tertiary and quaternary structure are not necessary. To determine whether a specific sequence in α2M is responsible for Aβ binding, we prepared and analyzed defined α2M fragments and glutathione S-transferase-α2M peptide fusion proteins. A single sequence, centered at amino acids (aa) 1314–1365, was identified as the only major Aβ-binding site. Importantly, Aβ did not bind to the previously characterized growth factor-binding site (aa 718–734). Although the Aβ binding sequence is adjacent to the binding site for LRP, the results of experiments with mutated fusion proteins indicate that the two sites are distinct. Furthermore, a saturating concentration of Aβ did not inhibit LRP-mediated clearance of α2M-MA in mice. Using various methods, we determined that the KD for the interaction of Aβ with its binding site in the individual α2M subunit is 0.7–2.4 μm. The capacity of α2M to bind Aβ and deliver it to LRP may be greater than that predicted by the KD, because each α2M subunit may bind Aβ and the bound Aβ may multimerize.

These results suggest that Aβ accumulation in the brain is a dynamic and reversible process. Proteins other than antibodies with the capacity to bind Aβ and promote its catabolism may influence disease progression. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) is a 718-kDa homotetrameric glycoprotein, which is well characterized as an extracellular proteinase inhibitor (11.Sottrup-Jensen L. Putnam F.W. The Plasma Proteins. 5.

At least two separate polymorphisms in the A2M gene may be associated with increased risk of late-onset AD. The first involves a region within intron 17, at the 5′ splice acceptor site for exon 18 (14.Blacker D. Wilcox M.A. Laird N.M. Rodes L. Horvath S.M. Go R.C. Perry R. Watson Jr., B. Bassett S.S.

Thus, locally synthesized α2M may affect AD progression by regulating the activity of various proteinases or by binding important growth factors. The previously demonstrated ability of α2M to bind and neutralize the activity of TGF-β (12.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Lin C. Yan F. Yu G.Q. Rohde M. McConlogue L. Masliah E. Mucke L. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGF-β has been reported to antagonize the cytotoxic activity of Aβ (29.Fabrizi C. Businaro R. Lauro G.M. Starace G. Fumagalli L. Exp.

Another mechanism whereby α2M may regulate AD progression involves its ability to bind Aβ, forming a complex that is internalized by the α2M receptor, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and then degraded (33.Narita M.

The same group also reported experiments confirming the interaction of Aβ with intact α2M; however, they did not demonstrate that the sequence identified by yeast-two hybrid screen is responsible for the binding of Aβ to intact α2M. The growth factor binding site in α2M is contained within a 16-amino acid peptide located ∼500 amino acids N-terminal to the Aβ-binding site identified by yeast-two hybrid screen (19.Webb D.J. Roadcap D.W. Dhakephalkar A. Gonias S.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1986-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The growth factor binding sequence is composed mainly of hydrophobic amino acids with two potentially important acidic residues. TGF-β, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and NGF-β all interact with the growth factor-binding site in α2M (18.Gonias S.L. Carmichael A. Mettenburg J.M. Roadcap D.W. Irvin W.P. Webb D.J.

Based on this promiscuous behavior, we hypothesized that the growth factor-binding site in α2M may also function as an Aβ-binding site. To test our hypothesis, we undertook a comprehensive molecular analysis to identify sequences in α2M with Aβ binding activity. Our results demonstrate that a single sequence, located near the C terminus of the α2M subunit, constitutes the only significant Aβ-binding site. Importantly, this sequence is entirely distinct from the growth factor-binding site. The LRP recognition sequence is also located near the C terminus of the α2M subunit (38.Sottrup-Jensen L.

Thus, in addition to the bait region, the α2M subunit has at least three distinct “protein interaction sites” with distinct binding specificities. These sites mediate interactions with growth factors, Aβ and LRP. α2M was purified from human plasma by the method of Imber and Pizzo (43.Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2M-MA was prepared by dialyzing α2M against 200 mm methylamine-HCl in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.2, for 12 h at 22 °C and then exhaustively against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Modification of α2M by methylamine was confirmed by demonstrating the characteristic increase in α2M electrophoretic mobility by non-denaturing PAGE (15.Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). α2M-MA was radioiodinated using IODO-BEADs (Pierce) and stored at 4 °C for no more than 2 weeks. The specific activity was 0.5–1.0 μCi/μg. Receptor-associated protein (RAP), which blocks binding of α2M-MA to LRP (65.Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Aβ(1–40) was purchased from Bachem and radioiodinated using 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (di-iodinated, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Biotinylated Aβ(1–40) was prepared by reacting Aβ(1–40) with 4 μmsulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C in siliconized tubes. The reaction mixture was dialyzed extensively against water. Biotinylated Aβ was stored for up to 1 month at 4 °C or frozen at −80 °C and thawed once without affecting its ability to bind to α2M. GST-specific IgG, bovine serum albumin (BSA, greater than 99% pure), dithiothreitol (DTT), and iodoacetamide were from Sigma Chemical Co. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin were from Pierce. Polyclonal Aβ-specific rabbit antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. When α2M is treated with papain under mildly acidic conditions, an 18-kDa fragment is released from the C terminus of each α2M subunit (aa 1314–1451) (38.Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Van Leuven F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 18-kDa fragment includes the intact receptor-binding site and is thus referred to as the receptor binding fragment (RBF). The residual 600-kDa α2M remnant retains the major structural features of the parent molecule (45.Hussaini I.M. Figler N.L. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To obtain the 18- and 600-kDa α2M fragments, 4.0 μm α2M-MA was treated with 2.4 μm papain in 50 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm cysteine, pH 5.0, for 20 h at 22 °C. The pH of the reaction mixture was increased to 7.4, and the products were purified by molecular exclusion chromatography on Ultrogel AcA-22. Each α2M subunit has a single thiol ester bond formed by the side chains of Cys-949 and Gln-952 (11.Sottrup-Jensen L. Putnam F.W. The Plasma Proteins. 5.

Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8087-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When α2M is heated in the presence of SDS, the thiol esters react internally, and, as a result, the α2M peptide backbone is cleaved (47.Swenson R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8087-8091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Harpel P.C. Hayes M.B. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8669-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products include a 120-kDa N-terminal heat fragment and a 60-kDa C-terminal heat fragment. To produce α2M heat fragments, native α2M was incubated at 100 °C in 2% SDS (w/v) and 14 mm DTT for the indicated periods of time. The products were treated with iodoacetamide (70 mm) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Six previously described fusion proteins, which collectively encode amino acids 99–1451 of the human α2M sequence, were expressed in BL-21 cells (17.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G.

These fusion proteins include: FP1 (aa 99–392), FP2 (aa 341–590), FP3 (aa 591–774), FP4 (aa 775–1059), FP5 (aa 1030–1279), and FP6 (aa 1242–1451). Constructs encoding new GST fusion proteins, including FP6a (aa 1242–1365), FP6b (aa 1242–1400), and FP6c (aa 1365–1451), were generated using PCR and the intact A2M cDNA in pBluescript as a template. The oligonucleotides included recognition sequences for BamHI and EcoRI, to allow direct cloning into the vector, pGEX-2T. Final constructs were subjected to sequence analysis to verify proper orientation and reading frame. Two constructs, labeled FP6d, correspond in sequence exactly to the 18-kDa RBF (aa 1314–1451). In FP6d-AA, Lys residues at aa 1370 and 1374, which are critical for LRP binding (39.Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol.

In FP6d-AR, Lys-1370 was mutated to Ala, and Lys-1374 was mutated to Arg. All of the fusion proteins were partially purified from induced bacterial suspensions by selective detergent extraction, as previously described (17.Webb D.J. Wen J. Karns L.R. Kurilla M.G. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13339-13346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The resulting preparations yielded clearly defined bands, with the correct molecular masses when assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gels or immunoblot analysis with GST-specific antibody. FP3, FP6, and FP6d-AA were purified to homogeneity by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. Fig. 1 shows the sequences of the GST fusion proteins used in this investigation. 125I-Aβ (2.5 nm) was incubated with native α2M, α2M-MA, or the purified 600-kDa fragment (0.3–1.0 μm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, increasing concentrations of the 18-kDa RBF (0.2–2.8 μm) were co-incubated with125I-Aβ and α2M-MA. Reaction mixtures were subjected to non-denaturing PAGE, using the buffer system described by Van Leuven et al. (49.Van Leuven F. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol.

In control experiments, free125I-Aβ did not migrate near α2M. To quantitate 125I-Aβ binding to α2M, gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software. Non-denaturing PAGE preserves non-covalent interactions; however, the amount of binding detected may be influenced by dissociation of protein complexes during electrophoresis (13.Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B. Moses H.L. Hayes M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because Aβ binding to α2M is reversible and probably subject to rapid dissociation when methods such as non-denaturing PAGE or chromatography are used, we utilized the BS3 rapid cross-linking method to determine the apparent KD for the binding of Aβ to α2M-MA. This method has been used previously to determine KDvalues for the interaction of α2M with multiple growth factors and cytokines (12.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B. Moses H.L. Hayes M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Increasing concentrations of α2M-MA were incubated with 25 nm125I-Aβ for 2 h at 37 °C. Freshly dissolved BS3 (5 mm) or vehicle (H2O) was then added for 5 min. Cross-linking reactions were quickly terminated by rapid acidification, followed by transfer to buffered SDS. Under pseudo-first order conditions, a constant fraction of the non-covalent 125I-Aβ·α2M-MA complex is covalently stabilized by the BS3 (13.Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B. Moses H.L. Hayes M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To quantitate the amount of covalently stabilized complex, BS3-treated and vehicle-treated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. 125I-Aβ that was covalently cross-linked to α2M-MA (bound) and free 125I-Aβ (free), which includes free Aβ and Aβ that was bound to α2M-MA but not cross-linked, were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Results were analyzed according to the following equation (12.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),free/bound=(KD/z)(1/α2M­MA)+1/z−1Equation 1 The cross-linking efficiency, z, is a constant, derived from the y intercept, for each set of proteins and conditions (12.Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). z is referred to as the BS3-cross-linking efficiency but may also be affected if a fraction of the radioiodinated protein is incapable of binding to the α2M. The apparent KD was determined from the slope when free/bound was plotted against 1/[α2M-MA]. This value is based on the assumption that there is a single binding site for Aβ in α2M. Assuming one Aβ-binding site/α2M subunit, as suggested by our data, then the KD must be corrected by multiplying the apparent KD by a factor of four. This method has been previously used to demonstrate specific and saturable binding of growth factors to denatured α2M subunits, α2M fragments, and GST-α2M-peptide fusion proteins (17.Webb D.J. Wen J.

https://openalex.org/W2076569395,"Abstract The human estrogen receptor-α, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a ligand-regulated transcriptional modulator. Because comparatively little is known about the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of the estrogen receptor (F domain), we used secondary structure prediction to design mutations that delete the F domain (S554stop), disrupt a possible turn (G556L/G557L), and alter a predicted helix (S559A/E562A, Q565P), and we evaluated the effects of these mutations on hormone binding and transcription activation in response to estradiol and the mixed agonist/antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Mutations that deleted the F domain (S554stop) or targeted the predicted helix (S559A/E562A, Q565P) greatly reduced or eliminated the agonist activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Deleting the F domain increased the affinity of the receptor for estradiol and decreased the antagonist activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The Q565P mutant exhibited a non-cooperative hormone-binding mechanism, as well as an impaired response to estradiol and increased antagonist activity of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Our results show that mutations in the F domain alter not only the response to estradiol, the affinity for hormone, and the interaction between receptor subunits but can uncouple the agonist and antagonist activities of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. These results suggest that the F domain modulates the activity of the estrogen receptor-α by multiple mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2002030236,"BCL6 translocation affecting the chromosomal band 3q27 can involve a number of non-immunoglobulin (non-IG) gene loci as partners. We report here that the gene for interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) is the partner of BCL6 in t(3;16)(q27;p11) translocation. The two breakpoints on 16p11 of a lymphoma cell line YM and case no. 1012 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, both of which carried t(3;16), were localized within the ∼27-kb intron 1 of IL-21R. As a result of t(3;16), the promoter region of IL-21R was substituted for the regulatory sequences of BCL6 in the same transcriptional orientation. Reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction revealed chimeric mRNA consisting of two non-coding exons 1a/1b of IL-21R and coding exons of BCL6 in both lymphoma cells. Fluorescence in situ chromosomal hybridization of YM metaphase cells revealed fusion signals that contained both the BCL6 and IL-21R sequences on the der(3)t(3;16) chromosome. IL-21R was actively transcribed in YM cells, while BCL6 that was under the control of the IL-21R promoter was only moderately expressed at the mRNA and protein level. We constructed expression plasmid of BCL6 that followed the promoter sequences of IL-21R. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the plasmid expressed high level Bcl-6 protein and displayed nuclear staining with a characteristic punctate pattern by immunofluorescence, indicating that expression of BCL6 can be enhanced by t(3;16). This study added to the list of non-IG partners of BCL6 translocations a new class of gene, i.e. cytokine receptor gene, the expression of which is closely associated with lymphoid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070294369,"The activity of dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase was found in the crude extract of a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrobaculum islandicum JCM 9189. The dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase was a membrane associated enzyme and was solubilized from the membrane fractions by treatment with Tween 20. The solubilized enzyme was purified 34-fold in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20 by four sequential chromatographies. The enzyme has a molecular mass of about 145 kDa and consisted of homotetrameric subunits with a molecular mass of about 42 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the subunit was MKVAIVGGGIIGLFTAYHLRQQGADVVI. The enzyme retained its full activity both after incubation at 80 °C for 10 min and after incubation in the range of pH 4.0–10.0 at 50 °C for 10 min. The enzyme-catalyzed dehydrogenation of several d-amino acids was carried out using 2,6-dichloroindophenol as an electron acceptor, andd-proline was the most preferred substrate among thed-amino acids. The Michaelis constants ford-proline and 2,6-dichloroindophenol were determined to be 4.2 and 0.14 mm, respectively. Δ1-Pyrroline-2-carboxylate was identified as the reaction product from d-proline by thin layer chromatography. The prosthetic group of the enzyme was identified to be FAD by high-performance liquid chromatography. The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase gene was determined and encoded a peptide of 363 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 40,341. The amino acid sequence of the Pb. islandicum enzyme showed the highest similarity (38%) with that of the probable oxidoreductase in Sulfolobus solfataricus, but low similarity with those ofd-alanine dehydrogenases from the mesophiles so far reported. This shows that the membrane-bound d-proline dehydrogenase from Pb. islandicum is a novel FAD-dependent amino acid dehydrogenase. The activity of dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase was found in the crude extract of a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrobaculum islandicum JCM 9189.

Kristjansson J.K. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 95-101Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recently, the d-amino acid content in Pb. islandicum has been determined, and the occurrence of several d-amino acids, includingd-serine, d-aspartate, andd-proline, was found at high levels (2.Nagata Y. Tanaka K. Iida T. Kera Y. Yamada R. Nakajima Y. Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. Yamanaka T. Koga Y. Saitou T. Kawaguti- Nagata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the physiological function and the metabolic pathway of thed-amino acids are still unknown, particularly in hyperthermophilic archaea. Therefore, the crude extract of Pb. islandicum cells was assayed for enzymatic activity using severald-amino acids. As a result, we found the activity of a dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase, which catalyzed the dehydrogenation of d-proline in the presence of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (Cl2Ind).1 The activity was exclusively detected in the membrane fraction of Pb. islandicum after fractionation by ultracentrifugation. The presence of dye-linked dehydrogenases that catalyze the dehydrogenation of d-amino acids has been so far reported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.Magor A.M. Venabres W.A. Biochemie (Paris). 1987; 69: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), Pseudomonas fluorescens (4.Tsukada K. J. Biol.

However, these enzymes predominantly utilize d-alanine as the most preferable substrate. The dehydrogenase utilizingd-proline as the best electron donor has not been reported so far. In this paper, we report the solubilization, purification, characterization, and nucleotide sequencing of the dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase from a hyperthermophilic archaeon,Pb. islandicum JCM 9189, and that the enzyme is a novel amino acid dehydrogenase. Cl2Ind and d-proline were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries.allo-4-Hydroxy-d-proline, FAD, FMN, and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were obtained from Sigma and Tween 20 from Nacalai Tesque. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. The hyperthermophlic archaeon Pb. islandicum JCM 9189 was obtained from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms. Pb. islandicum was cultured as described previously (8.Kujo C. Ohshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2152-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl solution. The washed cells were suspended in 10 mmTris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at −20 °C. Enzyme activity was assayed spectrophotometrically with a Shimadzu 160A spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostat. The standard reaction mixture was composed of 20 mmd-proline, 0.2 mm Cl2Ind, 200 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and enzyme in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C in a cuvette with a 0.2-cm light path. The reaction was started by the addition of Cl2Ind and was followed by measuring the initial decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. One enzyme unit was defined as the amount catalyzing the reduction of 1 μmol of Cl2Ind for 1 min. The millimolar absorption coefficient (εmm) of 19.1 mm−1 cm−1 at 600 nm was used for Cl2Ind (9.Ma K. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6509-6517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of ferricyanide,p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT), and horse heart cytochrome c, methylene blue, and benzyl viologen were assayed at 420 nm (εmm = 9.7 mm−1 cm−1), 490 nm (εmm = 15.0), 550 nm (εmm = 13.5), 670 nm (εmm = 7.8), and 580 nm (εmm = 7.8), respectively (10.Ohshima T. Tanaka S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by a BCA Protein assay reagent kit supplied by Pierce with bovine serum albumin as standard. The cell suspension was passed twice through a French pressure cell at 6.9 megapascals. After removal of the unbroken cells by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant solution was further centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 1 h (Beckman Ultracentrifuge). The precipitate was used as the membrane fraction. Dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase was solubilized by resuspending the membrane fraction in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) Tween 20. The buffer (1 ml) was mixed with about 10 mg of the membrane protein. After stirring at room temperature (about 25 °C) for 12 h, the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 1 h. The entire operation was performed at room temperature (about 25 °C). Glycerol (10% v/v), EDTA (0.1 mm), and Tween 20 (0.1% w/v) were added to all buffers used in purification steps. The solubilized dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The enzyme solution was placed on the Red Sepharose CL-4B column (2.0 × 8.0 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The column was washed with the same buffer and subsequently washed with bed volume 5 of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2.0 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The enzyme solution was placed on a hydroxyapatite column (GIGAPITE K-100, Seikagaku Kogyo; 1.5 × 4.0 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). After the column was washed with 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) concentration (0.001–0.5 m). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0). The enzyme solution was subjected to fast performance liquid chromatography on an Uno Q column (Bio-Rad; 1.2 × 5.3 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0). After the column was washed with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0), the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration (0 to 0.25 m). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The enzyme solution was subjected to fast performance liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Superdex 200 prep grade column (0.26 × 62 cm; Amersham Biosciences). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm potasium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on the 2–15% slab-polyacrylamide gradient gel (SDS-gradient/PAGE) using a premade gel system (Daiichi Pure Chemicals) by the method as described by Laemmli (11.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Myosin (200,000 Da), β-galactosidase (116,248 Da), bovine serum albumin (66,267 Da), aldolase (42,400 Da), carbonic anhydrase (30,000 Da), and myoglobin (17,201 Da) were used as molecular standards (Daiichi Pure Chemicals). The protein sample was boiled for 5 min in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.0), containing 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein was stained with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in the mixture of 50% methanol and 10% acetate. The reaction product in the oxidation of d-proline with dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase was identified by thin layer chromatography. As the product, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate or Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate is postulated. The two products, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate and Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate, are converted into glutamate and 4-aminobutyrate, respectively, by H2O2oxidation as described elsewhere (12.Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 206: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (75 μl) containing 28 mmd-proline, enzyme (0.3 unit), and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was prepared, and the reaction was started by the addition of 100 mmCl2Ind (1 μl) to the mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated at 50 °C until the blue color of Cl2Ind disappeared. This oxidation procedure of d-proline by the addition of Cl2Ind was periodically repeated 20 times. The product was further oxidized by the addition of 30% H2O2 (2 μl) to the mixture. After completion of the reaction, the enzyme was denatured by addition of 30% (v/v) perchloric acid (PCA) (10 μl), and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min). The supernatant was neutralized with 2 mK2CO3 (12 μl), and the aliquot was subjected to thin layer chromatography (silica gel 60F254 plate, 20 × 20 cm, Merck) together with d-proline, 4-aminobutyrate, andl-glutamate solutions using a developing solvent (phenol:H2O = 75:25). The spots of product and three other authentic amino acids were localized with ninhydrin (0.25% w/v in acetone). Michaelis constants were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots of data obtained from the initial rate between d-proline or allo-4-hydroxy-d-proline as the electron donor and Cl2Ind as the electron acceptor at 50 °C. The flavin compound from the enzyme was extracted with 1% (v/v) PCA as described elsewhere (9.Ma K. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6509-6517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Willie A. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16703-16707Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After the removal of the precipitate formed by centrifugation, the supernatant was used to identify the flavin compound by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a TSK gel ODS-80 Ts column (4.6 × 150 mm, TOSOH). A linear gradient between 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing methanol (20% v/v) and methanol was used for the elution. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the total elution time was 15 min. FAD and FMN were monitored by the absorbance at 260 nm. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was analyzed with an automated Edman degradation protein sequencer. The phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives (PTH-Xaa) were separated and identified using the protein sequencer PPSQ-10 (Shimadzu). For screening of the dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase gene, the oligonucleotide mixture probe (26-mer, 64 kinds, 5′-TTYACIGCITAYCAYYTIMGICARCA-3′) was synthesized based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme: the underlined sequence of MKVAIVGGGIIGLFTAYHLRQQGADVVI. The probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase with MEGALABELTM (Takara), purified by ProbeQuantTM G-50 Micro Column (Amersham Biosciences), and used as a specific probe for colony and Southern hybridizations. The genomic DNA from Pb. islandicum was prepared by Genomic PrepTM Cell and Tissue DNA Isolation kit (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA yield was ∼2.2 mg from 2 g of cells. For screening the dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase gene, the genomic DNA prepared from Pb. islandicum was digested with XbaI. The plasmid vector pUC18 was also digested with XbaI and treated with alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). It was ligated with the genomic DNA XbaI fragments from Pb. islandicum and used to transform E. coli JM 109 as a genomic library for screening of the dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase gene. Colony hybridization was done as follows. The recombinant colonies from the genomic library were transferred and fixed onto the nylon membranes (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences); the membranes were then incubated with 3 × SSPE (20 × SSPE: 3 m NaCl, 173 mm NaH2PO4·2H2O, and 25 mm EDTA (pH 7.7)) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. Prehybridization was done at 53 °C for 24 h in a mixture containing 6 × SSC (0.5 m NaCl, 0.05m sodium citrate (pH 7.0)), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, and 100 μg/ml salmon testes DNA (Sigma). The membranes were then hybridized in a mixture containing 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μg/ml salmon testes DNA (Sigma), and 500,000 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled probe at 53 °C for 48 h. The membranes were then washed twice with washing buffer (6 × SSC and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate) at 53 °C for 20 min. The positive clones were detected with BAS-1500 system (Fuji film). The nucleotide was sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method (14.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using an automated DNA Sequencer 377A (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequence was analyzed using GENETYX gene analysis software (Software Development Co., Ltd.). The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper has been submitted to the DDBJ, GenBankTM, and EBI data banks under accession number AB071692. For construction of the expression plasmid, a 1.0-kbp gene fragment, which consisted of the structural gene of Pb. islandicum dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase, and NdeI and BamHI linkers were amplified by PCR with the following two primers. The first was designed to contain the N-terminal region of the dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase gene and the NdeI digestion sequence (5′-ATCTGCATATGAAGGTTGCCATCGTTGGAGGT-3′) and the second was to contain the C-terminal region and the BamHI digestion sequence (5′-TATACAGGATCCCTAGCGGCGGAAGCGGCG-3′). The pDPDH2 plasmid DNA was used as the template. The amplified 1.0-kbp fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated with the expression vector pET-11a (Novagen) linearized with NdeI and BamHI to generate pDPDH3. E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlusTM cells (Stratagene) were transformed by the recombinant plasmids and plated on Luria-Bertani medium with ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The transformants were grown to OD660 of 0.5 at 37 °C in a medium containing 12 g of tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of glycerol, 12.5 g of K2HPO4, 3.8 g of KH2PO4, and 50 mg of ampicillin/liter. After induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h incubation, the cells were harvested and washed twice with 0.85% NaCl solution. The washed cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) Tween 20. The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant solution was used as the crude extract. The enzyme solution was incubated at 80 °C for 10 min. Denatured proteins were separated by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). The resulting supernatant was used for further purification. The entire operation was performed at room temperature (about 25 °C). Glycerol (10% v/v) and Tween 20 (0.1% w/v) were added to all buffers used in purification steps. The recombinant dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0). The enzyme solution was placed on the DEAE-Toyopearl 650 mcolumn (TOSOH, 2.0 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 20 mmTris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0). After the column was washed with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration (0 to 0.5 m). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0). The enzyme solution was placed on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, 1.3 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 20 mmTris/HCl buffer (pH 9.0). After the column was washed with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration (0 to 0.3 m). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Many dye-linked dehydrogenases are known to be membrane-bound enzymes. We tested whether the dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase was present in a soluble or membrane-binding form. The cells of Pb. islandicum were broken using a French press cell, and the extract was fractionated into the particulated and supernatant fractions by ultracentrifugation. The activity of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase in the two fractions was measured. More than 90% of the activity was found in the particulated fractions, and 94% of NAD-glutamate dehydrogenase, a typical soluble enzyme, was recovered in the soluble fractions. This shows that the enzyme may be tightly bound to the cytoplasmic membrane. The enzyme was solubilized by the treatment with 1% Tween 20 and fractionated into particulated and supernatant fractions by ultracentrifugation. More than 62% of the activity was found in the supernatant fraction. Thus, we purified the enzyme from the supernatant fraction. The purification of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase from Pb. islandicum is summarized in Table I. The dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase after the final step was highly purified (34-fold) in a yield of 10% from the membrane fraction.Table IPurification of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase from Pb. islandicumStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Crude extract12041900.157100Membrane fraction4512290.507121Solubilization1312011.53106Red Sepharose CL-4B51.31242.4265GIGAPITE14.31017.0653Uno Q7.4082.611.243Superdex 200 prep grade3.7019.65.3010 Open table in a new tab After gel filtration using Superdex G-200 prep grade at the final step of the purification, the dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase activity was eluted as one main peak, and the elution curve of activity practically coincided with that of the protein elution curve (Fig. 1A). The molecular mass of the enzyme corresponded to about 145 kDa (Fig. 1B). The molecular mass of the subunit was estimated by SDS-gradient/PAGE. The SDS-gradient/PAGE of the enzyme showed only one major band; the enzyme consists of an identical subunit (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the subunit was estimated to be about 42 kDa from the standard curve obtained from SDS-gradient/PAGE. This indicates that the enzyme may be composed of a tetrameric structure.Figure 2SDS-PAGE of the enzyme.Left column, molecular maker proteins; right column, the enzyme. A gradient gel (2–15%) was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The thermostability of the enzyme was examined. The enzyme retained its full activity after incubation at temperatures from 30 to 80 °C for 10 min but remarkably lost its activity after incubation at 100 °C for 10 min (Fig. 3). When the enzyme was incubated between pH 4.0 and 10.0 at 50 °C for 10 min, the activity completely remained. The enzyme activity was measured at various pHs in 200 mm buffer. Potassium phosphate, HEPES, Tris/HCl and glycine/KOH buffers were used for the assays at pH 6.5–8.0, pH 7.0–8.5, pH 7.5–8.5, and pH 9.0–10.0, respectively. The maximum activity was observed around pH 7.5 for thed-proline dehydrogenation, and half of the activity was obtained at pH 6.5 and 8.5. The enzyme activity was measured at various temperatures (40–70 °C) in 200 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The assay was started by the addition of Cl2Ind after preincubation for 2 min at various temperatures. The enzyme activity was linearly increased with increasing temperature to 70 °C. The highest activity was above 70 °C, and the correct assay was not achieved above 70 °C, because of the non-enzymatic decolorization of Cl2Ind. The ability of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase to catalyze the dehydrogenation of various amino acids was examined. The enzyme catalyzed the dehydrogenation of d-proline as the most preferred substrate. The enzyme also showed activity for severald-amino acids to some extent (Table II). The electron acceptor specificity of the enzyme was examined. Cl2Ind was the most preferred electron acceptor for the enzyme. Phenazine methosulfate (PMS) and an INT coupled system and PMS and an MTT coupled system exhibited electron acceptor activity, relative activities of 43 and 33%, respectively, to Cl2Ind. Ferricyanide, NAD, NADP, O2, menadione (vitamin K3), benzyl viologen, horse heart cytochrome c, and methylene blue were inert as electron acceptors.Table IISubstrate specificity of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenaseSubstrateRelative activity%d-Proline100allo-4-Hydroxy-d-proline89d-Isoleucine49d-Valine41d-Leucine39d-Histidine30d-Phenylalanine28d-Alanine26d-Glutamate23d-Aspartate21d-Threonine15d-Tryptophan14d-Serine13d-Arginine10l-Proline0 Open table in a new tab The reaction product ofd-proline dehydrogenation catalyzed by the enzyme was identified by thin layer chromatography. The reaction product was postulated to be Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate or Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate. Δ1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate and Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate were converted into glutamate and 4-aminobutyrate, respectively, by H2O2treatment, and the two amino acids were clearly separated and identified by thin layer chromatography. As the result of the enzyme reaction, a ninhydrin spot corresponding to 4-aminobutyrate was detected on the plate in the thin layer chromatography (data not shown). This shows that the reaction product is Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate but not Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. The apparent Km values for d-proline and Cl2Ind were determined to be 4.2 and 0.14 mm, respectively. The apparent Km values for allo-4-hydroxy-d-proline and Cl2Ind were 9.5 and 0.29 mm, respectively. The flavin compound extracted from the purified enzyme with 1% PCA was analyzed by HPLC. The flavin compound in the enzyme extract was identified to be FAD and not FMN. The N-terminal sequence of the enzyme was analyzed by an automated Edman degradation protein sequencer. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the subunit (28-amino acid residues) was determined to be MKVAIVGGGIIGLFTAYHLRQQGADVVI. For cloning of the dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase, the XbaI genomic library of Pb. islandicum was screened using32P-labeled oligonucleotide mixtures as the probe. After screening of recombinant plasmids by Southern hybridization, positive clones were selected, and pDPDH1 carrying a 4.0-kbp XbaI fragment from the genome of Pb. islandicum was obtained from one clone. Fig. 4 shows the restriction map of the 4.0-kbp insert DNA from the recombinant pDPDH1. From the further Southern hybridization analysis, a dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase coding sequence was determined to exist in the SalI fragment in the inserted DNA of pDPDH1 (Fig. 4). The 1.9-kbp SalI fragment was subcloned and sequenced (pDPDH2). We found a 1089-bp single open reading frame encoding 363 amino acids (Fig. 5). The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to that obtained from protein sequencing (underlined in Fig. 5). The transcription product showed a molecular mass of 40,341 Da. In the upstream of the start codon in the enzyme gene, a sequence TATAAA like a bacterial promoter region was recognized (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 5).Figure 5Nucleotide sequence of the SalI fragment subcloned from pDPDH1 and the deduced amino acid sequence of Pb. islandicum dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase. The probable promoter region is indicated by asterisks. The bold underlinedsequence was determined from the N-terminal region of Pb. islandicum dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase. The underlined sequence was the SalI region.

Almost all of the enzyme activity was detected in the precipitate fraction by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) after disruption of the transformant E. coli cells. Thus, we disrupted the cells suspended in Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) supplemented with 1% Tween 20 to recover the activity in the supernatant solution after centrifugation. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by heat treatment and two column chromatographies (Table III). An efficient purification of the enzyme was achieved; about 6.5 mg of the pure enzyme was prepared from the crude extract of E. coli cells obtained from a 500 ml culture medium. The molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme (about 42 kDa) was the same as that of the native enzyme judging from the SDS-gradient/PAGE. The N-terminal amino acid sequence is identical to that determined with the enzyme purified from Pb. islandicumcells.Table IIIPurification of recombinant dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenaseStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Crude extract17455150.29100Heat shock2603101.1960DEAE-Toyopearl1021781.7335Q-Sepharose6.4685.113.216 Open table in a new tab In this study, we have found the activity of dye-linkedd-proline dehydrogenase in the membrane fraction of a terrestrial hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pb. islandicum JCM 9189. The most preferable substrate for this enzyme wasd-proline and not d-alanine. The presence ofd-alanine dehydrogenase as dye-linked d-amino acid dehydrogenase has been reported so far in some mesophilic bacteria such as P. aeruginosa (3.Magor A.M. Venabres W.A. Biochemie (Paris). 1987; 69: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and E. coli (6.Olsiewski J.P. Kaczorowski G.J. Walsh C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4487-4494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not the presence of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase. The reactivity of d-proline for P. aeruginosa enzyme is about one-fifth that of d-alanine (3.Magor A.M. Venabres W.A. Biochemie (Paris). 1987; 69: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, the enzyme in Pb. islanidcum is largely different fromd-alanine dehydrogenase reported so far in this respect. To our knowledge, this is the first example showing the existence of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase as a dye-linked amino acid dehydrogenase. The product from d-proline by the enzyme reaction was Δ1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate, but not Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We have already found the dye-linked l-proline dehydrogenase in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus profundus and identified Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate as a product of the enzyme reaction from l-proline (19.Sakuraba H. Takamatsu Y. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Ohshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This indicates that the regioselectivity of dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase on the substrate is in contrast to that of the dye-linkedl-proline dehydrogenase as well as the difference in stereoselectivity for the substrate. In addition, the substrate specificity is comparatively low; various d-α-amino acids containing d-isoleucine and d-valine as well asd-proline could be the electron donor. In contrast, the T. profundus dye-linked l-proline dehydrogenase acts on the l-configuration of proline, and its substrate specificity is extremely high (19.Sakuraba H. Takamatsu Y. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Ohshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, from the aspect of specificity, the dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase is totally different from the dye-linked l-proline dehydrogenase, although both are similar dye-linked FAD-dependent amino acid dehydrogenases. A detailed comparison of the structure and function of the two dehydrogenases may give us further information about the novel membrane-bound dye-linked amino acid dehydrogenases. The three-dimensional analysis of the enzyme is now under investigation. The sequence similarity of the enzyme was detected from the data research on genome sequences, and a high similarity (about 38%) in amino acid sequence was detected in the sequence of a putative oxidoreductase in the aerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon S. solfataricus (15.She Q.

In addition, we compared the sequence of Pb. islandicum dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase with those of other mesophilic d-amino acid dehydrogenases (Fig. 6). The Pb. islandicum dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase shows a low similarity with a d-amino acid dehydrogenase small subunit from bacteria including Klebsiella aerogenas (25%) (20.Janes B.K. Bender R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 563-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and homologues from several bacteria, including E. coliO157 (25% similarity) (17.Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L.

DNA Res. 2000; 7: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In contrast, a partially high sequence homology was detected in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions between the Pb. islandicum enzyme and bacterial d-amino acid dehydrogenases. In the case of mesophile d-amino acid dehydrogenases, the N-terminal region is considered to be a site anchoring it to the membrane (22.Lobocka M. Henning J. Wild J. Klopotowski T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1500-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the N-terminal region is postulated to be one of the anchoring sites to the membrane. However, most parts of the sequence of Pb. islandicum enzyme except for N-terminal and C-terminal regions are fairly different from those of d-amino acid dehydrogenases (Fig. 6). This suggests that the dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase is inherently different from bacterial d-amino acid dehydrogenases so far reported and is a novel type of FAD-dependent d-amino acid dehydrogenase. In general, dye-linked dehydrogenases have high potential utilization as a specific element for biosensors (23.Frew J.E. Hill H.A. Anal. Chem. 1987; 59: 933A-944ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The highly thermostable dye-linked d-proline dehydrogenase exhibits a high potential usefulness for application to the d-amino acid analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2330269768,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is an inherited cancer syndrome that includes pheochromocytoma. Germline mutations in RET are responsible for MEN 2 but the precise pathogenetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis are unknown. We have recently identified possible mechanisms of tumor formation in patients with MEN 2A-related pheochromocytoma. Two of nine tumors investigated, however, did not reveal either of these mechanisms. In the present study, we therefore searched for other possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of MEN 2A-related pheochromocytoma. Hereditary pheochromocytoma also occurs in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a syndrome consisting of tumors caused by inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. A subset of sporadic pheochromocytomas have somatic mutations in RET or VHL, suggesting that both genes contribute to pheochromocytoma pathogenesis in a subset of tumors. It is unknown, however, whether VHL gene alterations would be associated with tumorigenesis in hereditary, MEN 2-related pheochromocytoma. We therefore investigated four pheochromocytomas from patients with MEN 2A and RET germline mutations for the presence of allelic deletion and/or somatic mutation of the VHL gene. LOH analysis using the polymorphic markers D3S1038 and D3S1110 that map to the VHL gene locus 3p25/26, revealed evidence for somatic VHL gene deletion in all four MEN 2A-related pheochromocytomas. Mutation analysis of the VHL gene showed frameshift mutations in two tumors and a splice acceptor mutation in one tumor. The remaining tumor did show LOH but not mutation of the VHL gene. These results suggest that somatic genetic alterations of the VHL gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of some MEN 2A-related pheochromocytomas."

Q., Wei, C. C., Ghosh, S., Meade, A. L., Hemann, C., Hille, R., and Stuehr, D. J. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12819–12825). To investigate whether NOHA oxidation to citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) is regulated by a similar mechanism, we performed single turnover reactions with wild type iNOSoxy and mutants W457F and W457A. Ferrous proteins containing NOHA plus H4B or NOHA plus 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (H2B), were mixed with O2-containing buffer, and then heme spectral transitions and product formation were followed versus time. All three proteins formed a FeIIO2 intermediate with identical spectral characteristics. In wild type, H4B increased the disappearance rate of the FeIIO2intermediate relative to H2B, and its disappearance was coupled to the formation of a FeIIINO immediate product prior to formation of ferric enzyme. In W457F and W457A, the disappearance rate of the FeIIO2 intermediate was slower than in wild type and took place without detectable build-up of the heme FeIIINO immediate product. Rates of FeIIO2 disappearance correlated with rates of citrulline formation in all three proteins, and reactions containing H4B formed 1.0, 0.54, and 0.38 citrulline/heme in wild type, W457F, and W457A iNOSoxy, respectively. Thus, Trp-457 modulates the kinetics of NOHA oxidation by iNOSoxy, and this is important for determining the extent of citrulline and NO formation. Our findings support a redox role for H4B during NOHA oxidation to NO by iNOSoxy.

Each NOS is distinguished by its tissue location, regulation, and function (4.Butt E. Bernhardt M. Smolenski A. Kotsonis P. Frohlich L.G. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Lohmann S.M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. J. Biol.

However, they all synthesize NO from l-arginine (Arg) by catalyzing two consecutive reactions, which consume a total of 1.5 NADPH and 2 O2 for each NO formed from Arg (for review, see Refs.11.Alderton W.K.

In the first reaction, Arg undergoes hydroxylation to form water and Nω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) as an enzyme-bound intermediate. In the second reaction, NOHA undergoes oxidation to generate water, NO, and citrulline (Scheme FS1). Both reactions take place within a NOS oxygenase domain homodimer (NOSoxy), which contains two equivalent active sites comprised of iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), the cofactor (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), and the substrate binding site (14.Fischmann T.O.

Electrons derived from NADPH are provided to NOSoxy by attached reductase domains, which bind FMN, FAD, and NADPH (17.Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Accordingly, O2 activation in both reactions of NO synthesis is modeled after cytochrome P450 monooxygenase chemistry (Fig. 1). The transfer of an electron to the ferric NOS heme enables O2 binding and formation of a detectable ferrous-dioxy specie (FeIIO2) (heme specie I) (19.Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J.

The reduction of FeIIO2 by a second electron is thought to form an iron-peroxo specie (heme specie II), which upon protonation and O–O bond scission can generate water and a high valence iron-oxo specie (heme specie III). The first electron provided to heme comes from the NOS reductase domain, whereas the second electron can come from the reductase domain or from H4B (22.Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R.

Soc. 2001; 123: 2674-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the second electron transfer in NOS and how it impacts downstream events like substrate oxidation. Experiments that view a single catalytic turnover are particularly helpful in this regard. In such experiments, ferrous NOSoxy proteins, which contain substrate and H4B, are rapidly mixed with oxygenated buffer to start the reaction. The progress of heme intermediates, electron transfer, and product formation are followed by rapid spectral acquisition and chemical quenching techniques. Our single turnover study of the Arg reaction showed that H4B reduces an FeIIO2intermediate, and this electron transfer is kinetically coupled to Arg hydroxylation (29.Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, a conserved Trp residue (Trp-457 in mouse iNOSoxy), which interacts with H4B by π stacking, was found to control the tempo of FeIIO2reduction by H4B (30.Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Ghosh S. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This finding appears to be important, because a slower reduction of FeIIO2by H4B in iNOSoxy mutants W457A and W457F was associated with slower and less complete Arg hydroxylation. Crystal structures of the Trp-457 iNOSoxy mutants suggest that they alter H4B redox function by causing structural changes that destabilize the H4B radical (31.Aoyagi M. Arvai A.S. Ghosh S. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that protein residues like Trp-457 can control the tempo and extent of Arg hydroxylation by influencing H4B reduction of the FeIIO2 intermediate. Although H4B has a clear redox function in the Arg reaction, whether it behaves similarly during NOHA oxidation is still unknown. Bound H4B is clearly required for NOS to convert NOHA to NO plus citrulline in both single and multiple turnover reactions (22.Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol.

However, H4B reduction of FeIIO2 cannot be assigned, because there is only minimal H4B radical build-up during NOHA oxidation by NOS (34.Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H.

Given this limitation, our Trp-457 mutants may provide an alternative approach to investigate H4B function in the second reaction of NO synthesis. Therefore, we studied NOHA oxidation under single turnover conditions in wild type, W457A, and W457F iNOSoxy. Our goal was 2-fold. (a) Define consecutive heme transitions that occur during the NOHA reaction and their temporal and quantitative relationship to product formation. (b) Determine whether Trp-457 mutations impact these parameters. Our results provide a kinetic framework for NOHA oxidation by iNOSoxy and are consistent with a redox role for H4B in the second reaction of NO synthesis. DTT was obtained from Sigma. H4B and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (H2B) were purchased from the laboratory of Dr. B. Schirck (Jona, Switzerland), NOHA was a gift from Dr. Bruce King (Wake Forest University, Winston Salem, NC). All other chemicals were from Sigma or from sources reported previously (29.Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Wild type and mutant iNOSoxy proteins (amino acids 1–498) containing a six-histidine tag at their C termini were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the pCWori vector and purified as reported previously (37.Ghosh S.

Concentrations of iNOSoxy proteins were determined from the absorbance at 444 nm of their ferrous-CO complexes, using an extinction coefficient of 76 mm−1 cm−1. W457A and W457F iNOSoxy proteins were preincubated with H4B or H2B (as required) on ice overnight before performing experiments because of their lower affinity toward H4B (30.Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C.

NOHA was added to the protein samples just prior to dithionite reduction to minimize its hydrolysis to citrulline. Mutant and wild type iNOSoxy proteins were reduced to ferrous forms as described previously (29.Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 30.Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Ghosh S. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J.

The ferric proteins were placed in a cuvette, made anaerobic by repeated cycles of vacuum and N2 purging, diluted in N2-purged Hepes buffer (50 mm), pH 7.5, containing DTT, H4B or H2B, and NOHA. Graded amounts of a dithionite solution were then added under anaerobic conditions, and heme reduction was monitored spectroscopically. Full heme reduction typically required a slight molar excess of dithionite. All single turnover experiments were performed three or four times using different batches of iNOSoxy proteins prepared in this manner. Rapid-scanning measurements were carried out in a Hi-Tech (SF-61) stopped-flow apparatus equipped for anaerobic work and coupled to a Hi-Tech MG-6000 diode array detector. Ferrous iNOSoxy proteins prepared as described above were transferred into the stopped-flow instrument using a gas-tight syringe. The reactions mixed equal volumes of anaerobic enzyme solutions with air-saturated Hepes buffer at 10 °C. Final (post-mixing) concentrations for wild type iNOSoxy were 14 μm protein, 100 μm H4B or H2B, 0.5 mm DTT, and 100 μm NOHA. Final concentrations for W457A and W457F mutants were 7–9 μm protein, 1.5 mm H4B or H2B, 3 mmDTT, and 0.5 mm NOHA. Ninety-six spectral scans were obtained after each mixing. Sequential spectral data were fit to different reaction models using the Specfit global analysis program provided by Hi-Tech Ltd. that could calculate the number of different enzyme species, their spectra, and their concentrations versus time during the single turnover reactions. In some cases, reacted samples were collected from the exit loop of the instrument and frozen immediately on dry ice for product analysis by high performance liquid chromatography. The kinetics of NOHA oxidation during the single turnover reaction was studied using a Hi-Tech RFQ-63 rapid-quench instrument as described previously (29.Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L.

In general, solutions of ferrous iNOSoxy proteins containing NOHA plus H4B or H2B were mixed with an equal volume of oxygen-saturated buffer at 10 °C followed by rapid quenching with the same volume of 1 n HCl. Reactions contained 0.1–0.13 mm wild type or Trp-457 mutants plus 2 mmH4B or H2B, 3 mm DTT, 3 mm NOHA, and 0.1 mml-glutamate as an internal standard. Ferrous protein solutions were prepared as described above for the rapid-scanning experiments. An analysis of amino acids present in the quench-flow reactions was done as described elsewhere (29.Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

The samples were vortexed for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and had 1 μl of 30 mm methyl red added. Acid was partially neutralized immediately prior to analysis by slowly adding 5n NaOH to each sample until the color changed from pink to yellow. Amino acids in aliquots taken from single turnover reactions run in anaerobic vessels from stopped-flow rapid-scanning experiments or from rapid-quench experiments (acid neutralized) were derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde and then analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (29.Wei C.C.

Samples generated in anaerobic vessels or in the stopped-flow instrument were filtered through an Amicon Centricon device (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) prior to derivatization. For high performance liquid chromatography, we used a Hewlett-Packard ODS-Hypersil column that was eluted with a gradient of buffer A (5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, 20% methanol) and buffer B (100% methanol). Retention times and concentrations of amino acids were calculated based on NOHA and citrulline standard solutions. Citrulline in samples generated by rapid quenching was quantitated relative to the l-glutamate standard. Nitrite was measured using the Griess colorimetric assay (32.Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We first determined the stoichiometry of NOHA conversion to citrulline for wild type iNOSoxy and for the W457A and W457F mutant iNOSoxy proteins. Mechanistic considerations predict that ferrous iNOSoxy should convert one NOHA to citrulline/heme in a single turnover reaction (32.Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33.Gorren A.C. Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R. Lange R. Mayer B.

Anaerobic samples of dithionite-reduced (ferrous) iNOSoxy proteins containing NOHA plus H4B were mixed with O2-containing buffer, and the reactions were allowed to go to completion. Wild type iNOSoxy generated 1.0 ± 0.03 (n = 3) citrulline/heme from NOHA in the single turnover reaction. This result matches the stoichiometry we observed for nNOSoxy NOHA reactions run in a similar manner (38.Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). W457F and W457A iNOSoxy proteins generated 0.54 ± 0.10 (n = 3) and 0.38 ± 0.06 (n = 4) citrulline/heme, respectively. The rank order of nitrite formed in the reactions mimicked citrulline production (wild type > W457F > W457A, data not shown). Control experiments run without dithionite or without enzyme produced no citrulline from NOHA, and the addition of superoxide dismutase did not lower product formation (data not shown). Wild type and mutant iNOSoxy reactions that contained H2B all produced some citrulline from NOHA (up to 0.4 citrulline/heme), but in these cases SOD addition decreased citrulline production by 60%, suggesting NOHA had reacted in a non-enzymatic manner with superoxide. Thus, all three iNOSoxy proteins oxidized NOHA to citrulline and nitrite in the single turnover reaction. The enzymatic reaction required H4B, and catalysis by Trp-457 mutants was less efficient than wild type. We next examined heme transitions associated with catalysis during the NOHA single turnover reaction. The solutions of ferrous iNOSoxy containing NOHA and H4B were rapidly mixed with O2-containing buffer in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a rapid-scanning diode array detector, and spectral data were subject to global analysis using software provided by the instrument manufacturer. For wild type iNOSoxy, the spectral data were best fit to an A → B → C → D model with three monophasic transitions, and thus discerned four distinct spectral species. These were in order of appearance the ferrous enzyme, two transient intermediates, and ferric enzyme (Fig. 2A). The Soret and visible absorbance features of the first and second transient species match those of FeIIO2 and ferric-NO (FeIIINO) complexes of iNOS, nNOS, or endothelial NOS that have been observed under similar circumstances (19.Abu-Soud H.M.

Calculated rates for the three heme transitions are listed in Table I. Oxygen binding to ferrous iNOSoxy represents the first transition. Maximal accumulation of FeIIO2 specie was only 55% total enzyme because of its similar rates of formation and disappearance (Table I). The next transition represents conversion of the FeIIO2 species into the FeIIINO specie. This product-forming step represents kcat for the reaction (29.Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C.

In the first reaction of NO synthesis (Arg hydroxylation), H4B speeds FeIIO2 disappearance relative to an H2B-containing enzyme, because only H4B can donate an electron to the FeIIO2 intermediate (29.Wei C.C.

The NH2-terminal domain (∼70 kDa), which contains six copies of the heavy metal-associated repeat GMT/HCXXC, is also able to bind zinc. We have used circular dichroism (CD) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize zinc binding to the NH2-terminal metal-binding domain. These studies have revealed that zinc is able to bind to this domain with a stoichiometry of 6:1, and upon binding, induces conformational changes in the NH2-terminal domain. These conformational changes are completely different from those previously observed for copper binding to the domain and lead to an overall loss of secondary structure in the domain. The XAS spectra indicate that zinc is ligated primarily by nitrogen atoms and therefore has low affinity for the heavy metal-associated repeats where copper has been shown to bind. The differences between zinc and copper binding may serve as the basis for the metal-ion mediated regulation of the ATPasein vivo.

Although it is required by many developmentally important enzymes, excess copper is toxic due to its free radical generating ability. In response to this potential threat, many organisms have evolved elaborate control mechanisms to tightly regulate the availability of free copper ionsin vivo. Failure of these systems usually leads to severe biological consequences. In humans, there are two major genetic disorders of copper metabolism, Wilson disease (WND) 1The abbreviations used are: WNDWilson diseaseMNKMenkes diseaseCDcircular dichroismDTTdithiothreitolEXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structureGSTglutathioneS-transferaseTCEPtricarboxyethyl phosphineWCBDNH2-terminal copper-binding domain of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPase (residues 1–649)HMAheavy metal-associated domain (GMT/HCXXC)EXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structureXANESx-ray absorption near-edge structureXASx-ray absorption spectroscopyand Menkes disease (MNK) (1.Mercer J.F.B.

The gene responsible for the disease is located on chromosome 13 and has been shown to encode a 1411-amino acid, copper-transporting, P-type ATPase (ATP7B) (3.Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M.

Genet. 1993; 5: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). In line with the observed pathology of the disease, the gene is found to be expressed at high levels in the liver and kidney and at lower levels in the lung, placenta, and brain (3.Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies have shown that under steady-state conditions the WND ATPase is localized primarily to the trans-Golgi network where it pumps copper from the cytoplasm into the trans-Golgi network lumen (5.Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 6.Schaefer M. Hopkins R.G. Failla M.L. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G639-G646PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of the ATPase can be altered by the concentration of copper. Under elevated copper concentrations the ATPase undergoes a reversible, copper-mediated translocation from the trans-Golgi network to a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment (5.Hung I.H. Suzuki M.

Recent studies in polarized hepatocytes suggest that the ATPase translocates to the apical canalicular membrane where it would pump copper directly into the bile (7.Roelofsen H. Wolters H. Van Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In contrast to Wilson disease, Menkes disease is an X-linked disorder, which is characterized by a global deficiency of copper in the body. As in WND, MNK is caused by mutations in a copper-transporting, P-type ATPase (ATP7A) which shares a high degree of homology with the WND ATPase (8.Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 9.Mercer J.F.B. Livingston J. Hall B. Paynter J.A. Begy C. Chandrasekharappa S. Lockhart P. Grimes A. Bhave M.

As for the WND ATPase, the MNK ATPase has been shown to undergo copper-dependent translocation from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane (11.Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Both the WND and MNK ATPases are members of a growing superfamily of soft metal-ion transporting ATPases which have been identified in a variety of organisms (12.Rensing C. Ghosh M. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5891-5897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This superfamily can be further subdivided into those ATPases which transport Cu(I) and Ag(I) and those which transport Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II). These soft metal transporters have the common features of other P-type ATPases (ATP-binding, phosphorylation, and transduction domains) and in addition have a large NH2-terminal metal-binding domain. In the WND and MNK ATPases this domain contains six copies of the metal binding motif GMT/HCXXC (HMA, Heavy MetalAssociated domain), whereas those involved in transporting zinc, cadmium, or mercury have between one and three copies of this motif (13.Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Previously we and others have shown that the NH2-terminal domain from the WND protein is able to bind six copper atoms tightly in addition to binding several other metals with varying affinities (14.DiDonato M.

Moreover, it has also been shown that copper binding to the NH2-terminal domains of the WND and MNK proteins occurs through a cooperative mechanism (14.DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R.

Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Functional studies on the WND and MNK proteins have also shown that at least some of the six NH2-terminal HMA repeats are required for both copper transport activity and for copper-induced protein translocation (17.Forbes J.R.

We have recently performed a detailed structural analysis of copper binding to the WCBD using CD and XAS (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This study revealed that copper binding to the WCBD induces significant conformational changes in the domain. This observation together with other functional data leads us to postulate that copper-induced conformational changes in the WCBD stimulate the phosphorylation of the ATPase, thereby initiating the copper transport cycle (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although we have previously shown that zinc is able to bind to the WCBD in65Zn(II) blotting experiments (14.DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), information regarding its binding mode and possible conformational changes has not been available. We report here the first detailed structural analysis of the WCBD with various stoichiometries of zinc using CD and XAS. This analysis has revealed that, although zinc is able to bind to the WCBD, its binding mode and the conformational changes it induces are significantly different from those observed from the binding of copper. These differences between copper and zinc binding may have implications for the regulation of the ATPase in vivo. The cDNA encoding the WCBD which was previously expressed using the GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-2 (14.DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Bioscience) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Following lysis by freeze/thawing, the fusion protein was present in both the soluble fraction and in inclusion bodies. Fusion protein which was localized to inclusion bodies was solubilized in 6 m urea, combined with the soluble fraction, refolded, and purified as previously described (14.DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The refolded protein was analyzed by CD spectroscopy to confirm that the refolding procedure was successful. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The identity of the expressed protein was confirmed by seven rounds of amino-terminal sequencing. This procedure yielded fusion protein which was >95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. The GST moiety was removed from the fusion protein by incubation with the PreScission protease (Amersham Bioscience). One unit of PreScission protease per milligram of fusion protein was added to the protein solution and the reaction mixture incubated at 5 °C for 16–48 h. The progress of the cleavage reaction was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Once the reaction was judged complete, the mixture was passed over a glutathione affinity column to remove free GST and the protease (the protease is supplied as a fusion with GST). The flow-through solution contained the purified WCBD. Following purification, the WCBD is found to contain approximately six bound copper atoms (14.DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Apo-WCBD (and apo-GST-WCBD) was obtained as follows. A solution containing the purified WCBD was made 0.5 m in β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 4 °C for 6–8 h. Following this incubation, the proteins were rapidly precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was re-dissolved in 0.5 m Tris base, 6 m urea, and 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol with gentle rocking at 4 °C overnight. Upon dissolution, the protein was again precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and re-dissolved in 0.5 m Tris, 6m urea. The protein was then refolded by dialysis against modified refolding buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol) and then refolding buffer without glycerol. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and then analyzed for metal content by neutron activation analysis. Samples of WCBD (or GST-WCBD) containing various amounts of added zinc were prepared as follows. DTT was added to a solution of apo-WCBD to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated on ice for 30 min. The required amount of zinc (supplied as ZnSO4) was then added to achieve the desired final molar ratio of zinc:WCBD and incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min; the DTT present was used to ensure the reduction of protein thiols and serve as a competitive ligand for zinc. To avoid the use of exogenous sulfhydryl containing compounds, some samples were reconstituted in the presence of TCEP, a non-sulfhydryl reducing agent, instead of DTT. The unbound metal and DTT (or TCEP) were removed by extensive dialysis against 25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for CD samples). The protein concentration was again confirmed by the BCA protein assay, and metal content was assessed by neutron activation analysis. All dialysis buffers were sparged extensively with argon before use and dialysis was performed in sealed containers. Typical concentrations of apo-WCBD protein used in the this procedure were between 1 and 5 mg/ml. XAS samples were lyophilized by first flash freezing them using a dry ice/acetone bath and then lyophilizing them for 4 days on a Freezemobile 25XL lyophilizer (Virtis). The lyophilized samples of WCBD reconstituted with various amounts of zinc were packed into EXAFS sample cells (20 × 2 × 2 mm) and sealed with Mylar tape. X-ray absorption spectra were collected between 9479 and 10405 eV at beamline X9B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beamline BioCAT-18 of the Advanced Photo Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. The data were collected in fluorescence mode at 10–20 K with a flat Si (220) double-crystal monochromator and a 13-element Ge detector at NSLS, and at 50–80 K with a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator and ion chamber detector at APS. The monochromators were calibrated using the edge energy of zinc foil at 9659.0 eV. The treatment of raw EXAFS data to yield χ has been discussed in detail in review articles (21.Teo B.-K. Teo B.-K. Joy D.C. EXAFS Spectroscopy, Techniques and Applications. Plenum, New York1981: 13-58Google Scholar, 22.Scott R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 11: 414-459Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The SSExafs program was used to extract χ from Aexp by using a cubic spline function, including preliminary baseline correction and correction of fluorescence data for thickness effects and detector response. General procedures for analysis using the programSSExafs have been presented in other papers (23.Scarrow R.C. Trimitsis M.G. Buck C.P. Grove G.N. Cowling R.A. Nelson M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15023-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The refinements reported were on k3χ data and the function minimized was r = (Σk6(χc − χ)2/N)1/2, where the sum is over N data points between 2 and 14 Å−1. Single-scattering EXAFS theory allows the total EXAFS spectrum to be described as the sum of shells of separately modeled atoms,e.g.χc=ΣnA[f(k)k−1r−2exp(−2ς2k2)sin(2kr+a(k))]Equation 1 where n is the number of atoms in the shell, k = [8π2me(E −E0 + ΔE)/h2]1/2, and ς2 is the Debye-Waller factor (24.Scarrow R.C. Maroney M.J. Palmer S.M. Roe A.L. Que Jr., L. Salowe S.P. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7857-7864Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The amplitude reduction factor (A) and the shell-specific edge shift (ΔE) are empirical parameters that partially compensate for imperfections in the theoretical amplitude and phase functions (25.Teo B.-K. Lee P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2815-2832Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Phase and amplitude functions were theoretically calculated using a curved-wave formalism (26.McKale A.G. Veal B.W. Paulikas A.P. Chan S.-K. Knapp G.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 3763-3768Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar). A variation of FABM (fine adjustment based on models) was used here in the analysis procedure with theoretical phase and amplitude functions (27.Teo B.-K. Antonio M.R. Averill B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3751-3762Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For each shell, two parameters were refined at one time (r and n or ς2), while A and ΔE values were determined by using the data for the crystallographically characterized model complex, Pr4N[Zn(S-2,3,5,6-Me4C6H)3(1-methylimidazole)] generously provided by Professor James E. Penner-Hahn. The bond lengths used were 2.35 Å for zinc-sulfur bonds and 2.05 Å for zinc-N bonds. The fitting results indicate the average metal-ligand distances, the type and the number of scatterers and the Debye-Waller factors, which can be used to evaluate the distribution of zinc-ligand bond lengths in each shell. The EXAFS goodness of fit criterion applied here is,ɛ2=[(Nidp/v)Σ(χc−χ) 2/ςdata2]/NEquation 2 as recommended by the International Committee on Standards and Criteria in EXAFS (28.Bunker G. Hasnain S.S. Sayers D. Hasnain S.S. X-ray Absorption Fine Structure. Ellis Horwood, New York1991: 751-770Google Scholar, 29.Riggs-Gelasco P.J. Stemmler T.L. Penner-Hahn J.E. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1995; 144: 245-286Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), where ν is the number of degrees of freedom calculated as ν = Nidp −Nvar, Nidp is the number of independent data points, and Nvar is the number of variables that are refined. Nidp is calculated as Nidp = 2ΔkΔR/π + 2, and ςdata is the estimated uncertainty of the data (usually set at 1) (30.Stern E. Phys. Rev. B. 1993; 48: 9825-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The use of ε2 as the criterion for the goodness of fit allows us to compare fits using different numbers of variable parameters. Samples for CD analysis containing various stoichiometries of zinc were prepared as described above and analyzed on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. For analysis of changes in secondary structure, samples were loaded into a 0.1-cm path length CD cell and spectra recorded from 300 to 190 nm. For analysis of changes in tertiary structure, samples were loaded into a 2-cm path length CD cell and spectra recorded from 400 to 250 nm. The spectra were corrected for the contribution of the buffer noise reduced, and the data were converted to molar ellipticity. Molar ellipticity values per residue were calculated by dividing the calculated molar ellipticity by the number of residues in the WCBD (649 residues). The concentration of the protein solution was 14.5 μm. Reconstitution of the WCBD with zinc indicates that it is able to bind zinc with a stoichiometry of 6:1. Addition of copper to a sample of refolded apo-WCBD results in Cu-WCBD with CD spectra which is very similar to that of soluble WCBD (Fig. 1A). This confirms that the refolding procedure has produced a natively folded WCBD which is able to bind copper. Samples of the WCBD containing 0, 2, 4, or 6 bound zinc atoms were prepared by the addition of zinc to the apo-WCBD as described previously, and CD spectra were obtained. Spectra were collected in both the far and near UV regions to examine changes in secondary and tertiary structure, respectively. Binding of increasing amounts of zinc to the domain gives rise to an overall loss in secondary structure content (Fig. 1B). While the addition of either 2 or 4 zinc atoms results in a relatively small change in the far UV CD spectra, the binding of 6 atoms of zinc induces a sharp decrease in ellipticity. These results indicate that, although zinc is able to bind to the domain fairly tightly, it seems to destabilize the domain relative to the native structure. The CD spectra of the 6:1 complex is still indicative of a folded protein, however; the sharp decrease in ellipticity compared with apo-WCBD suggests that a certain amount of secondary structure content (α-helicies and/or β-sheets) has been lost. These results are in sharp contrast to those observed for copper binding to the WCBD which show a progressive increase in secondary structure content as copper is bound by the domain (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Changes in the near UV CD spectra, indicative of tertiary structure changes, are also observed as zinc binds to the WCBD (Fig. 1C). The largest changes in line shape and ellipticity occur between 270 and 290 nm, with the largest change in intensity occurring upon the addition of the first four equivalents of zinc. Addition of two more equivalents of zinc to form the 6:1 complex did not produce any substantial changes relative to the 4:1 complex. These changes are relatively small when compared with those observed for copper binding to the WCBD where large changes in line shape and ellipticity are observed at 260, 290, and 330 nm (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The presence of positive ellipticity at 330 nm is indicative of the presence of disulfide bonds which would be expected in the absence of metal (31.Wingfield P.T. Pain R.H. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 7.6.1-7.6.23Google Scholar). When the WCBD is titrated with copper, ellipticity at 330 nm is lost and falls to zero in the 6:1 complex as copper is bound to the cysteine residues in the HMA domain (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, when the WCBD is titrated with zinc some ellipticity at 330 nm is lost but not completely eliminated (Fig. 1C). The presence of disulfide bonds in the 6:1 complex indicates that the bound zinc atoms may not be using cysteines as their primary ligands. The CD results suggest that the mode of zinc binding to the WCBD is substantially different from that observed for copper, which is bound with distorted linear coordination using two cysteine residues of each HMA motif (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the zinc-binding sites in the WCBD, XAS data were collected on five samples with 2, 4, or 6 bound zinc ions (Table I). Following reconstitution with zinc, all samples were lyophilized to maximize sample stability prior to XAS analysis. In a previous study (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) where a similar analysis was carried out on copper reconstituted WCBD, we observed that both liquid and lyophilized samples gave similar XAS spectra indicating that lyophilization did not have an adverse effect on metal coordination. The 2:1 and 4:1 samples were reconstituted in the presence of DTT or TCEP to determine whether the data would be affected by the addition of exogenous sulfhydryl ligands. All samples exhibit an edge energy of around 9662.8 eV, which is slightly higher than that of the Zn(II) model compounds used. The normalized x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data for the five zinc-WCBD samples are quite similar to each other with two poorly resolved bumps after the edge jump as shown in Fig. 2. Due to the poor resolution, not much information can be obtained regarding the nature of the zinc ligation, although the line shape observed is as broad as model complexes of peptides with N scatterers (32.Clark-Baldwin K. Tierney D.L. Govindaswamy N. Gruff E.S. Kim C. Berg J. Koch S.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Am. Chem.

All samples exhibit a prominent peak centered at r′ = 1.6 Å and a very minor peak atr′ = 2 Å in the r′-space spectra. Quantitative curve fitting results provide useful metrical information and are summarized in Table I. The major feature observed in all samples cannot be fitted with sulfur scatterers as seen by the large goodness-of-fit values. However, fitting that feature with 3–5 nitrogen scatterers at 2.03(2) Å results in significantly smaller goodness-of-fit values. Such distances are consistent with zinc-imidazole ligation (32.Clark-Baldwin K. Tierney D.L. Govindaswamy N. Gruff E.S. Kim C. Berg J. Koch S.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8401-8409Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The much weaker peak at r′ = 2 Å can be modeled with a very small amount of S scattering at 2.31 Å, typical of zinc thiolate bonds (32.Clark-Baldwin K. Tierney D.L. Govindaswamy N. Gruff E.S. Kim C. Berg J. Koch S.A. Penner-Hahn J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8401-8409Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For the 2:1 and 4:1 samples, only a small improvement in the quality of the fits is observed (Table I), suggesting that zinc-sulfur coordination does not make a significant contribution in these samples. However, for the 6:1 DTT sample, the goodness-of-fit value decreases by a factor of two, suggesting that the zinc-sulfur scattering contribution becomes more important in the presence of more than 4 zinc per protein. The amount of the surfur scatterer included in the fits increases slightly with the zinc-protein ratio, from an average of 0.4 surfur per zinc the 2:1 and 4:1 complexes to 0.7 sulfur per zinc in the 6:1 sample. Although the latter value may appear small on a per zinc basis, within the context of the entire protein unit this value can correspond to 1 zinc ion among the six bound having four surfur ligands (or 2 zinc with 2 surfur ligands), since EXAFS analysis can provide only the average coordination environment of the six metal-binding sites. Thus at lower zinc loadings, at most 1.6 surfur per protein is involved in metal binding. This value increases to 4 in the 6:1 sample. These results imply that zinc has a higher affinity for nitrogen or oxygen ligands in the WCBD, consistent with what is observed in the near UV CD spectra (Fig. 1C). Such ligation features are quite different from that in the Cu(I)-WCBD, where each binding site was found to ligate copper in +1 oxidation state using two cysteine side chains with a distorted two-coordinate geometry (20.DiDonato M. Hsu H.-F. Narindrasorasak S. Que Jr., L. Sarkar B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The copper binding result"

Whereas Myc proteins affect cell cycle progression positively, Mad proteins are negative regulators of cell proliferation. It has been shown in several in vitro systems that Mad proteins antagonize c-Myc functions. In this report we describe the inhibition of tumor cell outgrowth in vivo by Mad1 expression. Transformed cell lines were generated by co-transfection of c-myc, c-H-ras, and a chimeric mad1ER construct into primary rat embryo cells (MRMad1ER cells). Activation of Mad1 by 4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen (OHT) resulted in abrogation of telomerase activity, reduced cloning efficiency, and decreased proportion of cells in S phase. Injection of MRMad1ER cells into syngenic rats induced aggressively growing tumors after a short latency period. This tumor growth was inhibited by OHT-treatment of animals, with the extent of inhibition correlating with the amount of OHT injected. No effect of OHT on tumor growth was observed with similarly transformed Myc/Ras cell lines which did not express Mad1ER. These data demonstrate that Mad1 is able to suppress Myc/Ras-mediated transformation under in vivo conditions."

We report here the assembly of the minimal functional holoenzyme from Thermus thermophilus (Tth), an extreme thermophile. The minimal holoenzyme consists of α (pol III catalytic subunit), β (sliding clamp processivity factor), and the essential DnaX (τ/γ), δ and δ′ components of the DnaX complex. We show with purified recombinant proteins that these five components are required for rapid and processive DNA synthesis on long single-stranded DNA templates.

DH5α (F Φ80lacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169deoR recA1 endA1hsdR17(rK−, mK+)phoA supE44 λ−thi-1gyrA96 relA1) was transformed with plasmids for amplification of vectors. Buffer E is 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Buffer W is 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m KCl, 7 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole. TDB buffer is 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. HG.04 buffer is 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 7.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. ICX buffer is 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgOAc, and 5% glycerol. TBST buffer contained 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5m NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 (v/v). All intermediate plasmids were transformed into DH5α. AmpR colonies were selected and the plasmids were screened for gain or loss of the appropriate restriction sites. The sequences of inserted DNA were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Ligations were performed in the presence of T4 DNA ligase and ATP. Restriction enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression vectors utilized in this study were constructed from two starting vectors: pA1-NB-AvrII and pA1-NB-AgeI. To construct pA1-NB-AvrII, pDRK-N(M), a plasmid designed for expression of proteins with an amino-terminal tag was used as the starting plasmid (24.Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20690-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal tag is composed of a 30-amino acid peptide that is biotinylated in vivo and contains a hexahistidine sequence. The construct also contains a pBR322 origin of replication, a gene expressing the laqIQ repressor protein, and a semisyntheticE. coli promoter (pA1) that is repressed by thelacIQ repressor. Oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGGAAAAAAAAAGGTACCAAAAAAAAAGGCCGGCCACTAGTG-3′ and 5′-TCGACACTAGTGGCCGGCCTTTTTTTTTGGTACCTTTTTTTTTC-3′ were annealed to form a duplex with sticky ends (AvrII and SalI), and inserted into the AvrII/SalI-digested pDRK-N(M). The insertion of these annealed DNA fragments converted the polylinker following the fusion peptide fromPstI-AvrII-DraIII-SalI toPstI-AvrII-spacer-KpnI-spacer-FseI-SpeISalI. Construction of pA1-NB-AgeI was accomplished by modification of pA1-NB-AvrII whereby the polylinker in pA1-NB-AvrII that contained the restriction sitesPstI-AvrII-KpnI-FseI-SpeI was replaced with a polylinker containing the restriction sitesPstI-spacer-AgeI-BamHISacII-spacer-NcoI-SpeI. First, a BamHI site upstream of the polylinker was destroyed. This was accomplished by digesting pA1-NB-AvrII withBamHI and removing the sticky ends created by filling in with Klenow fragment. The blunted ends of the DNA were resealed. This plasmid was named pA1-NB-AvrII(BamHI−) and was digested with PstI/SpeI restriction enzymes. This removed the polylinker containing the restriction sitesPstI-AvrII-KpnI-FseI-SpeI. Oligonucleotides 5′-GAAAAAAAAAACCGGTGGATCCGCGGAAAAAAAACCATGGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTCCATGGTTTTTTTTCCGCGGATCCACCGGTTTTTTTTTTCTGCA-3′ were annealed and formed a DNA duplex with the sticky ends corresponding toPstI and SpeI restriction sites. This annealed DNA duplex was inserted into thePstI/SpeI-digested pA1-NB-AvrII thereby forming pA1-NB-AgeI. Expression of Tth dnaE (α subunit) was accomplished by the insertion of thednaE gene into pA1-NB-AvrII. The dnaE gene was amplified by PCR of the coding region from a BamHI fragment (4.9 kb) of Tth genomic DNA containing the dnaE gene cloned into a pBluescript IIKS+ phagemid vector. The forward primer 5′-GAATTCCTAGGCCGCAAACTCCGCTTC-3′ adds anAvrII site to the 5′ end of the dnaE gene so that the actual PCR product excludes the ATG start codon and begins at codon 2. The AvrII restriction site is adjacent to codon 2 and positions the 5′ portion of the dnaE gene in the same reading frame with the NH2-terminal fusion peptide coding sequences. The underlined sequence indicates the region of the primer complementary to the gene of interest here and below. The reverse primer (5′-GTGCTCGCGCAGGATCTCCCGGTCAATC-3′) was designed so that it was downstream of a KpnI restriction site withinTth dnaE (the KpnI site is ∼320 bases downstream of the start codon). The resulting PCR product was digested with PstI and KpnI and ligated into pAI-NB-AvrII that had been digested with the same two restriction enzymes forming pA1-NB-TE(5′). A 3454-bp KpnI/FseI fragment representing the 3′-end of the Tth dnaE gene was isolated from the 4.9-kb BamHI Tth genomic DNA fragment cloned into the pBluescript IIKS+ plasmid and inserted into the corresponding sites of pA1-NB-TE(5′). This plasmid (pA1-NB-TE) contained the entire Tth dnaE gene fused to a sequence encoding the amino-terminal tag. Tth dnaX was inserted into an expression vector by the same procedure as used for dnaE. A PCR reaction was designed to amplify a fragment containing the 5′ end of dnaX from a plasmid containing a 7.1-kb cloned fragment of Tth genomic DNA which contained the Tth dnaX gene. The forward primer (5′-AACTGCAGAGCGCCCTCTACCG-3′) added a PstI site to the 5′ end of the dnaX gene so that the actual PCR product excludes the ATG start codon and begins at codon 2. ThePstI restriction site positions the 5′ portion of thednaX gene in the same reading frame with the N-terminal fusion peptide coding sequences. The reverse primer (5′-CGGTGGTGGCGAAGACGAAGAG-3′) was designed so that it is downstream of the BamHI restriction site within Tth dnaX (the BamHI site is ∼318 bases downstream of the start codon). This PCR product was digested with PstI andBamHI and ligated into pAI-NB-AgeI which had been digested with the same two restriction enzymes forming pA1-NB-TX(5′). The 3′ region of the dnaX gene was removed from the 7.1-kb fragment by digestion with BamHI and SpeI and inserted into the precursor plasmid pA1-NB TX5′ that had been digested with the same two restriction enzymes. This formed the plasmid pA1-NB-TX, which contained the full-length Tth dnaX gene fused to the sequence encoding the amino-terminal tag. The Tth holA gene that encodes the δ subunit was inserted into pA1-NB-AvrII to be expressed fused to the amino-terminal tag. The holA gene was amplified by PCR using Tthgenomic DNA as a template. The forward/sense primer (5′-GAATTCTGCAGGTCATCGCCTTCACCG-3′) added a PstI site to the 5′ end of the gene so that the actual PCR product excludes the ATG start codon and begins at codon 2. The PstI site adjacent to codon 2 places the holA gene in the same reading frame with the NH2-terminal fusion peptide. The reverse primer (5′-AGATCTGGTACCTCATCAACGGGCGAGGCGGAG-3′) added an additional TGA (stop codon) to the end of the gene giving two stop codons in tandem and a KpnI restriction site was added in the non-complementary region of the primer for insertion into the vector. The PCR product was digested with PstI andKpnI restriction enzymes and inserted into pA1-NB-AvrII digested with the same enzymes. This formed the plasmid pA1-NB-TD, which contained the full-length Tth holA gene fused to the DNA sequence encoding the amino-terminal tag. The Tth holB gene which encodes δ′ subunit was cloned into pA1-NB-AgeI to be expressed fused to the amino-terminal tag. TheholB gene was amplified by PCR using Tth genomic DNA as a template. The forward/sense primer (5′-GAATTCTGCAGGCTCTACACCCGGCTCACCC-3′) added aPstI site to the 5′ end of the gene so that the actual PCR product excludes the ATG start codon and began at codon 2. ThePstI site adjacent to codon 2 places the holA gene in the same reading frame with the NH2-terminal fusion peptide. The reverse primer (5′-GGACACTAGTTCATCATGTCTCTAAGTCTAA-3′) was complementary to the 3′ end of the holB gene and added an additional TGA (stop codon). In addition, a SpeI restriction site was added in the non-complementary region of the primer for insertion into the vector. The PCR product containing the entire Tth holB gene was digested with PstI/SpeI restriction enzymes and inserted into pA1-NB-AgeI digested with the same enzymes. This formed the plasmid pA1-NB-TD′, which contained the full-lengthTth holB gene fused to the DNA sequence encoding the amino-terminal tag. To express Tth β subunit, a PCR fragment containing thednaN gene was amplified from genomic DNA. The forward primer (5′-AACTGCAGAACATAACGGTTCCCAAGAAACTCC-3′) added aPstI restriction site to the 5′ end adjacent to codon 2, so that when this fragment was inserted into pA1-NB-Age1, thednaN gene was in the same reading frame with the sequence encoding the amino-terminal tag. The reverse primer 5′-GAGCAGCTAGCCTACTAGACCCTGAGGGGCACCAC-3′) was designed so that an additional stop codon was added in the non-complementary region producing two stop codons in tandem. The non-complementary region of the reverse primer also contains an NheI restriction site. The PCR reaction resulted in a product that contained the entireTth dnaN gene. The PCR product was digested withPstI and NheI and inserted intoPstI/NheI-digested pA1-NB-AgeI forming pA1-NB-TN. The correct DNA sequence of all Tth genes cloned into expression vectors was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were grown, induced, and harvested using a 250-liter fermentor as described (43.Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), with the exception that ampicillin (100 μg/ml) andd-biotin (10 μm) was added at induction. Lysis of 400 g of cells and preparation of Fraction I for each of the subunits was performed as described by Cull and McHenry (44.Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Fraction I supernatants contained the following levels of protein: α (25 g), β (22 g), DnaX (25 g), δ′ (20 g), and δ (39 g). As an initial purification step, many endogenous E. coli proteins can be removed by adding ammonium sulfate to concentrations that cause the protein of interest (and some endogenous proteins) to precipitate, while other proteins remain in solution. Therefore, the concentration of ammonium sulfate (expressed as percent saturation at 4 °C) in which >80% ofTth target proteins and minimal amounts of E. coli contaminating proteins precipitate was determined for each subunit by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The Tthsubunits were precipitated using ammonium sulfate concentration of 45% saturation for α, 40% for τ/γ, δ, and β, and 35% for δ′ and were collected by centrifugation (23,000 × g, 45 min, 0 °C). Ammonium sulfate pellets were dissolved in 125 ml of buffer E using a Dounce homogenizer. Samples were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g) resulting in Fraction II. Fraction II contained the following levels of protein: α (3000 mg), β (2600 mg), DnaX (1100 mg), δ′ (620 mg), and δ (4400 mg). Fraction II was added to 60 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin in buffer E and agitated for 1.5 h at 4 °C and then poured into a column (2.5 × 5 cm). The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer W at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Tagged Tth proteins were eluted in 300 ml (10 column volumes) of buffer E containing a 10–200 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5) gradient. The eluate was collected in 150 × 2-ml fractions and the protein concentration for each fraction was determined. Fractions making up the upper one-half of the protein concentration peak were pooled. The proteins were >90% pure based on densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following purification, the proteins were dialyzed into HG.04 buffer (Spectra/Por dialysis tubing, 11.5-mm diameter, 3000 MWCO), rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The resulting Fraction IIIs contained the following levels of activity and protein: α (50 mg, 9.0 × 107 units, 1.8 × 106 units/mg), β (325 mg, 5.5 × 108 units, 1.7 × 106units/mg), DnaX (85 mg, 2.4 × 108 units, 2.8 × 106 units/mg), δ′ (35 mg, 6.0 × 108units, 17.0 × 106 units/mg), and δ (325 mg, 45.0 × 108 units, 14.0 × 106units/mg). One unit of activity is 1 pmol of total deoxyribonucleotide incorporated per min at 60 °C in the M13Gori reconstitution assay. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (45.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For SDS-PAGE, proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (14 × 16 × 0.75 cm) for 2.5 h at 250 V, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Proteins containing d-biotin were detected by biotin blots using phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. Proteins resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a HoeferTM SemiPhor transfer apparatus at constant voltage (30 V) in 12 mm Tris base (pH 8.5), 96 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS (w/v), and 20% methanol (v/v) for 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were blocked in TBST buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then rinsed with TBST and incubated in 2 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce Chemical Co.) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Following extensive washing with TBST, membranes were developed using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium One Component System (Pierce Chemical Co.). Western blot analysis of DnaX proteins was performed using the same method as biotin blots except that monoclonal antibodies elicited to NH2-terminal-tagged DnaX (Tissue Culture/Monoclonal Antibody Facility, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) were used instead of streptavidin. The antibodies selected for Western blotting experiments w"

We isolated and mapped a single non-chimaeric YAC (17IA12, 260-280 kb) containing D6S193 and D6S297. A further extended bacterial contig (between D6S264 and D6S149) has been established using PACs and BACs and a transcript map has been established. We have mapped six new markers to the YAC; three of them are ESTs (WI-15078, WI-8751, and TCP10). We have isolated three cDNA clones of EST WI-15078 and one clone contains a complete open reading frame. The sequence shows homology to a new member of the ribonuclease family. The other two clones are splice variants of this new gene. The gene is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues. It is expressed in 4/8 ovarian cancer cell lines by Northern analysis. The gene encodes for a 40 kDa protein. Direct sequencing of the gene in all the eight ovarian cancer cell lines did not identify any mutations. Clonogenic assays were performed by transfecting the full-length gene in to ovarian cancer cell lines and no suppression of growth was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2065065636,"δ-Opioid receptors (DOR) present on T cells have been shown to mediate the immunomodulatory effects of endogenous and synthetic DOR agonists on T cells. Considerable evidence indicates that there is stimulated transcription of DOR gene in activated T cells, which is correlated with augmented expression of DOR and enhanced capacity of DOR agonists to affect the T-cell's functions. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the stimulated transcription of the DOR gene in activated T cells is still unclear. In the present study, we analyzed a 1.3-kb DNA fragment immediately upstream of the translation start site (−1300 to +1 bp, with the translation start site designated as +1) of the mouse DOR gene in EL-4 cells, a mouse lymphoma T cell line that exhibits enhanced expression of DOR transcripts when activated by phytohemagglutinin. Through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we have demonstrated that increased binding activity of Ikaros at the Ikaros-binding site (−378 to −374) in the DOR promoter is required for the stimulated transcription of DOR gene in phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells. δ-Opioid receptors (DOR) present on T cells have been shown to mediate the immunomodulatory effects of endogenous and synthetic DOR agonists on T cells.

Quist H.E. Sharp B.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5049-5060PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Sharp B.M. McKean D.J. McAllen K. Shahabi N.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, β-endorphin was shown to enhance intracellular calcium mobilization in murine splenic T cells, which was inhibited by naltrindole, a selective DOR antagonist, whereas the selective μ-opioid receptor antagonist was ineffective (2.Sharp B.M. McKean D.J. McAllen K. Shahabi N.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 840: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, the enhancement of human T-cell proliferation by certain methionine-enkephalin analogs could be completely abolished by naloxone and selective DOR antagonists (3.Singh V.K. Bajpai K. Narayan P. Yadav V.S. Dhawan V.C. Haq W. Mathur K.B. Agarwal S.S. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1999; 6: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It was also reported that DOR agonists such as deltorphin and SNC-80 could concentration dependently suppress the expression of human immunodeficiency virus-1 in DOR-transfected human T cells (4.Sharp B.M. Gekker G. Li M.D. Chao C.C. Peterson P.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DOR transcripts and DOR protein have been detected at very low levels in mouse splenic and thymic T cells, as well as in some human or murine T-cell lines (5.Gaveriaux C. Peluso J. Simonin F. Laforet J. Kieffer B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the expression of DOR transcripts can be significantly enhanced during T-cell activation (6.Li M.D. Mcallen K. Sharp B.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7.Shahabi N.A. McAllen K. Matta S.G. Sharp B.M. Cell. Immunol. 2000; 205: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was reported that the expression of DOR transcripts could be markedly increased in murine splenic T cells stimulated by concanavalin A or anti-CD3-ε; since the DOR mRNA stability was not altered during T cell activation, the enhanced expression of DOR transcripts was apparently through a transcriptional mechanism (6.Li M.D. Mcallen K. Sharp B.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, concurrent with the enhanced expression of DOR transcripts, the expression of DOR protein was significantly increased in activated T cells, correlated with greater capacity of δ-opioids to affect the T-cell's functions (7.Shahabi N.A. McAllen K. Matta S.G. Sharp B.M. Cell. Immunol. 2000; 205: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the stimulated transcription of the DOR gene in activated T cells may raise the possibility of regulating the immunomodulatory effects of δ-opioids on T cells, by manipulation of the inducible expression of DOR. In the present study, we analyzed a 1.3-kb DNA fragment immediately upstream of the translation start site (−1300 to +1 bp, with the translation start site designated as +1) of the mouse DOR gene in EL-4 cells, a mouse lymphoma T cell line that constitutively expresses low level of DOR transcripts (5.Gaveriaux C. Peluso J. Simonin F. Laforet J. Kieffer B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and can be activated by low concentrations of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (8.Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1973; 110: 1470-1475PubMed Google Scholar). Through both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we have demonstrated that increased binding activity of Ikaros at the Ikaros-binding site (−378 to −374) in the DOR promoter is required for the stimulated transcription of the DOR gene in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. Mouse lymphoma EL-4 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and 4.5 g/liter glucose. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air. Total RNA was isolated from an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells using the TRI Reagent kit (Molecular Research Center) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 1.5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperscriptTM First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The resultant reverse transcription products were amplified by PCR. The sense primer was 5′-ATCTTCACCCTCACCATGATG-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′- CGGTCCTTCTCCTTGGAACC-3′. The expected PCR product is 355 bp (9.Sedqi M. Roy S. Ramakrishnan S. Loh H.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 65: 167-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Reverse transcribed products of ribosomal RNA (18 S) was measured for normalization, using 25 cycles of PCR amplification with QuantumRNA 18 S primers (Ambion). The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and photographed on a UVP Transluminator. The density of the DOR transcripts in each lane of the gels was calculated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized to the density of the RT-PCR-amplified 18 S rRNA fragment. The resultant relative DOR transcripts levels were analyzed using Student's ttest. PCR product was purified after 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and inserted into EcoRV site of the cloning vector pBluescript (Stratagene). Sequencing reactions were performed using Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Luciferase fusion plasmids pD1300, pD890, pD400, pD360, and pD262 were constructed as described previously (10.Liu H.C. Shen J.T. Augustin L.B. Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23617-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mutant constructs pD400-MIK1, pD400-MIK2, and pD400-MSP were constructed using Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The dominant-negative-Ikaros expression vector was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using the reverse transcription products from EL-4 cells total RNA as templates. The upper primer bears the essential Kozak sequence and the lower primer bears the XbaI site. The PCR product encodes partial amino acid sequence (from 282 to 517) of Ikaros-1 and was subcloned into EcoRV and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). All the correct clones were confirmed by sequencing. EL-4 cells were transfected using the DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) Lipofection method as described previously (11.Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with an equimolar amount of each plasmid. After a 24-h culture with or without PHA (1.5 μg/ml), cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). A one-fifth molar ratio of PCH110 plasmid (Amersham Bioscience) containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter was included in each transfection for normalization. Nuclear extracts were prepared from an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells using the method described by Johnson et al. (12.Johnson D.R. Levant S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides that were incubated with nuclear extract in EMSA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). For oligonucleotide competition analysis, a 75-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotide was also added to the mixture. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the mixture was analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. For the supershift assays, 2 μg of goat polyclonal anti-Ikaros antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the mixture. The reaction was then incubated on ice for 1 h. Protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA electrophoresis buffer at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. EL-4 cells (∼2 × 107 cells per sample) were fixed by formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) at a final concentration of 1%. Fixation proceeded at room temperature for 10 min and was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Nuclei were collected as described by Ausubel et al. (13.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, Media, PA1987Google Scholar). The following chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed according to the protocols described by Farnham and co-workers (14.Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nuclei were sonicated on ice to shear the chromatin to an average length of 400 bp. The chromatin solutions were precleared with the addition of Staph A cells for 15 min at 4 °C. Precleared chromatin was incubated with 2 μg of goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz: anti-Ikaros M-20), 1 μl of goat preimmune control serum, or no antibody at 4 °C overnight. After immunoprecipitation, washing, and elution (15.Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), cross-links were reversed by addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm; RNA was removed by addition of 10 μg of RNase A per sample followed by incubation at 65 °C for 5 h. Samples were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended for incubation with proteinase K. Then DNA was extracted and precipitated by standard protocols. DNA pellets were collected and analyzed through PCR. Approximately 2 ng of DNA was used as a template in a 50-μl PCR reaction mixture using 1 unit of pfu polymerase. For DOR amplification, a sense primer corresponding to the DOR promoter sequence from −458 to −439 and an antisense primer corresponding to the DOR promoter sequence from −339 to −320 were used. A set of primers specific to the GAPDH exon 8 was used for GAPDH amplification. The amplification was performed using one cycle at 95 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles at 95 °C for 40 s, 68 °C (for DOR) or 64 °C (for GAPDH) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Nuclear extracts were prepared from an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells using the method described by Johnson et al. (12.Johnson D.R. Levant S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). 16 μg of nuclear extracts were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated for 1 h with a 1/1000 dilution of anti-Ikaros serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and then washed and revealed using donkey anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1/5000, 1 h). Peroxidase was revealed with an Amersham Bioscience ECF kit. Proteins were quantified before being loaded onto the gel, and equal loading of extracts was verified by Ponceau coloration. EL-4 is a mouse lymphoma T cell line that constitutively expresses low levels of DOR transcripts and can be activated by low concentrations of PHA. To determine whether the expression of DOR transcripts could be enhanced in activated EL-4 cells, the cells were treated with PHA (1.5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Then total RNA was extracted from an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, DOR transcripts is expressed at a relatively low level in unstimulated EL-4 cells. However, the expression of DOR transcripts is apparently enhanced in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. The density of the DOR fragment in each lane was calculated and normalized to the density of RT-PCR-amplified 18 S rRNA fragment. Student's t test revealed significant difference between groups in the relative DOR transcript level (Fig. 1B). The PCR-amplified fragments were confirmed to be the desired DOR cDNA fragment by cloning and sequencing of the PCR products. To determine the regulatory elements that contribute to the stimulated transcription of DOR gene in activated T cells, serial deletional analyses were performed using the 1.3-kb DNA fragment immediately upstream of the translation start site (−1300 to +1 bp, with the translation start site designated as +1) of the mouse DOR gene. A primary luciferase reporter construct and its serial deletion constructs were prepared form this 1.3-kb DNA fragment as described under “Materials and Methods.” This primary construct, designated as pD1300, and its serial 5′-deletion constructs, designated as pD890, pD400, pD360, and pD262, are illustrated in Fig. 2. The pGL3-basic plasmid (designated as basic) containing neither promoter nor enhancer was included as a negative control. The promoter activity of each construct was tested by transient transfection assays in EL-4 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, all the luciferase reporter constructs showed similar luciferase activities in unstimulated EL-4 cells, with insignificant variations. In contrast, in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, pD1300, pD890, and pD400 showed a significant increase (over 2-fold) in the luciferase activity compared with that in unstimulated EL-4 cells; further 5′-deletion down to −360 abolished the increase of promoter activity. These data suggest that the sequence between −400 and −360 in the DOR promoter contains a regulatory element(s) that is essential for the stimulated promoter activity of DOR gene in activated T cells. The 40-bp DNA sequence between −400 and −360 in the DOR promoter was analyzed by sequence comparison using the Transcription Factors Data base (TRANSFAC 4.0), 2The site for TRANSFAC 4.0 is transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC/. which revealed two consensus Ikaros-binding sites (−385/−381 and −378/−374, respectively) and a consensus Sp1-binding site (−380/−375) that partially overlaps the Ikaros-binding sites (Fig. 3A). To determine which site(s) was functional, mutational analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 3A, the mutant constructs pD400-MIK1 and pD400-MIK2 have the same sequence of pD400 except for a point mutation in the consensus Ikaros-binding sites at −385/−381 and −378/−374, respectively, without altering the Sp binding motif at −380/−375; the mutant construct pD400-MSP has the same sequence of pD400 except for the Ikaros-binding site at −385/−381 and the Sp1-binding site being disrupted by “AAGCTT,” while leaving the Ikaros-binding motif at −378/−374 intact. As shown in Fig. 3B, the mutant constructs displayed similar luciferase activity to that of the wild type construct (pD400) in unstimulated EL-4 cells. In contrast, while the mutation in the Ikaros-binding site at −385/−381 (pD400-MIK1) or in the Sp1-binding site (pD400-MSP) did not show apparent effects on the stimulated DOR promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, the mutation in the Ikaros-binding site at −378/−374 (pD400-MIK2) abolished the increase in the promoter activity. These results indicate that the Ikaros-binding site at −378/−374 is essential for the stimulated DOR promoter activity in activated EL-4 cells. EMSAs were performed to determine the protein binding activity at the putative Ikaros-binding site. As shown in Fig. 4A, four oligonucleotides, D397/364, MIK1, MIK2, and MSP were synthesized, corresponding to the DOR promoter sequence −397 to −364 in constructs pD400, pD400-MIK1, pD400-MIK2, and pD400-MSP, respectively. First, EMSAs were performed in the presence of nuclear extracts from an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells, using D397/364 as the probe. As shown in Fig. 4B, nuclear extracts of unstimulated (lanes 2–7) or PHA-activated EL-4 cells (lanes 8–11) formed two major protein-DNA complexes with D397/364, which was specific because the formation of the complexes could be abolished by molar excess of unlabeled probe (lane 3). As molar excess of unlabeled consensus Ikaros-binding sequence (lanes 4 and 9) and Sp1-binding sequence (lane 5) could, respectively, abolish the formation of one of the two complexes, the complexes were designated as Ikaros-complex and Sp-complex, respectively. Anti-Ikaros antibody supershifted the Ikaros-complex to a higher position while the control serum did not (lanes 6 and 7 and lane 11), indicating that Ikaros proteins (16.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) could bind to the −397/−364 region of the DOR promoter. Interestingly, the binding activity of Ikaros in the −397/−364 region of the DOR promoter was very low in unstimulated EL-4 cells (lane 2); however, there was a marked increase in the Ikaros binding activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells (lane 8), which was correlated with the increased DOR promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. To correlate the in vitro protein-DNA binding activities with the in vivo promoter activities of pD400, pD400-MIK1, pD400-MIK2, and pD400-MSP, EMSAs were performed with oligonucleotides D397/364, MIK1, MIK2, and MSP in the presence of nuclear extracts from PHA-activated EL-4 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, the binding of Ikaros to D397/364 could be abolished by 75-fold excess of unlabeled MIK1 (lane 4), but not MIK2 (lane 5). Moreover, when MIK2 was used as the probe, there was no Ikaros-complex formed while the Sp-complex formation was not affected (lane 8). In contrast, when MIK1 or MSP was used as the probe, the Ikaros-complex formation was not affected (lanes 7 and 9). Combined with the data from the mutational analyses (Fig. 3), the EMSAs results indicate that increased binding activity of Ikaros to the Ikaros-binding site at −378/−374 is required for the stimulated DOR promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. To further determine whether Ikaros could bind to the DOR promoter in vivo, we performed in vivoformaldehyde cross-linking assays. First, an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde. Then the cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated by using antibody against Ikaros (anti-Ikaros M-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As negative controls, we included a sample without the addition of antibody, a sample with the addition of preimmune serum, and a non-cross-linked sample. After immunoprecipitation and reversal of the cross-links, enrichment of the endogenous DOR promoter fragment in each sample was monitored by PCR amplification using primers specific for the DOR promoter (as described under “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 5, in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, the PCR-amplified DOR promoter fragment was readily detectable in samples with the addition of anti-Ikaros antibody, while no detectable PCR products were observed in the negative controls. The binding detected in the DOR promoter was specific, because the antibody against Ikaros did not enrich the GAPDH gene fragments to the same level as they enriched the DOR promoter fragments (Fig. 5, lower). The in vivo Ikaros binding activity was not detectable when the same set of experiments was carried out in unstimulated EL-4 cells (data not shown), which may be explained by the very low binding activity of Ikaros in the DOR promoter in unstimulated EL-4 cells (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Together these results demonstrated that Ikaros could bind to the DOR promoter in vivo and suggest that the in vivo Ikaros binding activity in the DOR promoter is significantly increased in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. To confirm the functional role of Ikaros in the stimulated expression of DOR transcripts in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, we constructed a dominant-negative-Ikaros (DNIK) expression vector that encodes a mutant form of Ikaros containing no N-terminal zinc fingers. As at least three N-terminal zinc fingers are required for the sequence-specific and high-affinity binding of Ikaros to DNA, the DNIK is unable to bind DNA, but still able to dimerize with wild-type Ikaros (16.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, it functions by dimerizing with the wild-type Ikaros and preventing it from binding DNA. First, pD400 was co-transfected with the DNIK expression vector into unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, in unstimulated EL-4 cells, the DNIK did not show apparent effect on the promoter activity of pD400, in agreement with the low Ikaros binding activity in the DOR promoter in unstimulated EL-4 cells. However, the DNIK exerted an over 2-fold inhibition on the pD400 promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, confirming that Ikaros contributes to the stimulated DOR promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. To determine the DNIK's effect on the expression of DOR transcripts in EL-4 cells, the DNIK expression vector was transfected into unstimulated and PHA-activated EL-4 cells, followed by RT-PCR analyses to measure the expression of DOR transcripts. As shown in Fig. 7A, the DNIK did not affect the DOR transcripts expression in unstimulated EL-4 cells; however, in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, it apparently reduced the expression of DOR transcripts by more than 2-fold, almost to the level in the unstimulated cells. This observation was confirmed by quantitation (Fig. 7B). Together these results demonstrate that the DNA binding of Ikaros is required for the stimulated DOR promoter activity and thus the enhanced expression of DOR transcripts in PHA-activated EL-4 cells.Figure 7Effects of dominant-negative Ikaros on the expression of DOR transcripts in unstimulated and PHA-activated EL-4 cells.A, EL-4 cells were transfected with the dominant-negative Ikaros expression vector (1.0 μg) or the empty expression vector (1.0 μg). After a 24-h culture with or without PHA (1.5 μg/ml), total RNA from an equal amount of EL-4 cells was amplified by RT-PCR (30 cycles) and separated on agarose gels. RT-PCR-amplified 18 S rRNA fragment was measured for normalization (22 cycles). B, the relative DOR transcripts level was calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The histograms represent the means of relative DOR transcripts level from three independent experiments using different preparations of total RNA. The error bars indicate the range of standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the mechanism underlying the increased binding activity of Ikaros in the −378/−374 region of the DOR promoter in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, the nuclear expression of Ikaros was measured by Western blot analysis using nuclear extracts from an equal amount of unstimulated or PHA-activated EL-4 cells. As shown in Fig. 8, while the expression of Ikaros 1 was at similar levels in both unstimulated and PHA-activated EL-4 cells, the expression of Ikaros 2/3 was apparently increased in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, which provides an explanation for the augmented binding activity of Ikaros in the DOR promoter in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. The DOR present on T cells have been shown to mediate the immunomodulatory effects of δ-opioids on T cells. Although the expression of DOR transcripts is at very low levels in resting T cells, it is significantly increased in activated T cells through a transcriptional mechanism, correlated with augmented expression of DOR protein. To understand the mechanism underlying the stimulated transcription of the DOR gene in activated T cells, we analyzed the DNA sequences immediately upstream of the translation start site of the mouse DOR gene in the mouse EL-4 T cell line and have demonstrated that increased binding activity of Ikaros at the Ikaros-binding site (−378 to −374) in the DOR promoter is required for the stimulated transcription of DOR gene in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. The EMSAs data (Fig. 4) indicated that the −378/−374 Ikaros-binding site was required for Ikaros binding to the DOR promoter. Interestingly, in EMSAs where the radiolabeled probe was in much excess of the probe-binding factors, it was observed that Ikaros and Sp family proteins could, respectively, form complexes with the D397/364 probe and there was no Ikaros-Sp-complex formed (Fig. 4B), which suggests that Ikaros and the Sp family proteins could not bind to the probe simultaneously but compete for the composite Ikaros/Sp1-binding site. However, combined analysis of the data from both mutational analyses (Fig. 3) and EMSAs (Fig. 4) revealed that the Sp family proteins had no effect on the DOR promoter even though they may bind to the Ikaros/Sp1-binding site. We noted that in unstimulated EL-4 cells, there was little Ikaros-complex formed in EMSAs, in agreement with the low level of the DOR promoter activity as shown in Fig. 1A. In contrast, Ikaros showed a markedly increased binding activity at the −378/−374 Ikaros-binding site in PHA-activated EL-4 cells, correlated with the augmented DOR promoter activity. This observation was corroborated by the in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking assays. While the in vivo binding activity of Ikaros was not detectable in the DOR promoter in unstimulated EL-4 cells, it was detected in the PHA-activated cells (Fig. 5), indicating that the Ikaros binding activity was significantly increased in PHA-activated EL-4 cells so that it could be detected by the in vivocross-linking assay that has a relatively lower sensitivity than the EMSA. In combination with the data from mutational analyses, all these results indicate that increased binding of Ikaros to the −378/−374 Ikaros-binding site is indispensable for the stimulated DOR promoter activity in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. Moreover, the function role of the binding of Ikaros to the DOR promoter was confirmed by using a dominant-negative Ikaros that prevented the wild-type Ikaros from binding DNA (Fig. 7). The Ikaros gene encodes a family of hemopoietic-specific zinc finger transcription factors capable of high affinity DNA binding to sites that contain the GGGA core motif (17.Nichogiannopoulou A. Trevisan M. Friedrich C. Georgopoulos K. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18.Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Homo- and heterodimers formed between the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms (Ikaros 1, 2, and 3) or heterodimers formed between Ikaros and its dimerization partners (such as Helios and Aiolos) can greatly increase Ikaros affinity for DNA and consequently its ability to activate transcription (16.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Since the antiserum against Ikaros dimerization partners did not supershift the Ikaros-complex in EMSAs (data not shown), the Ikaros-complex supershifted by the anti-Ikaros antibody in the EMSAs (Fig. 4C) was predominantly comprised of Ikaros proteins. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of nuclear Ikaros 2/3 was apparently increased in PHA-activated EL-4 cells compared with that in the unstimulated cells (Fig. 8), thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the increased binding activity of Ikaros in the DOR promoter in PHA-activated EL-4 cells. In addition, interactions between the three DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms may generate six homo- and heterodimeric complexes with distinct combinations of two DNA-binding domains, which may confer different DNA binding potential to the complexes. Thus, we suggest that the increased expression of Ikaros 2/3 may also change the ratio of the homo- and heterodimers of Ikaros, and thus may result in an apparent increase in the binding affinity of Ikaros to the −378/−374 Ikaros-binding site in the DOR promoter context. Further studies will be needed to uncover the underlying mechanism(s). T lymphocytes are exposed to endogenous opioid peptides in vivo. For example, circulating β-endorphin originating from the pituitary and enkephalin peptides originating from the adrenal medulla continuously bathe T lymphocytes. In addition, T lymphocytes may also produce and release their own opioids (19.Blalock J.E. Prog. Neuroendocrinimmunol. 1988; 1: 9-12Google Scholar, 20.Wesley H.J. Kleiss K.J. Kelley K.W. Wong P.K.Y. Yuen P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As Ikaros has been reported to set threshold for T-cell activation (21.Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in the T-cell homeostasis (17.Nichogiannopoulou A. Trevisan M. Friedrich C. Georgopoulos K. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the link between Ikaros and the stimulated transcription of the DOR gene in activated T cells implicate an active role for endogenous opioids in modulating the functions and homeostasis of activated T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071971189,"Two aryl hydrocarbon receptors (rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β) have been identified in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). These receptors share 98% amino acid identity, yet their functional properties differ. Both rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β bind 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), dimerize with rainbow trout ARNTb (rtARNTb), and recognize dioxin response elements in vitro. However, in a transient transfection assay the two proteins show differential ability to recognize enhancers, produce transactivation, and respond to TCDD. To identify the sequence differences that confer the functional differences between rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β, we constructed chimeric rtAHRs, in which segments of one receptor form was replaced with the corresponding part from the other isoform. This approach progressively narrowed the region being examined to a single residue, corresponding to position 111 in rtAHR2β. Altering this residue in rtAHR2β from the lysine to glutamate found in rtAHR2α produced an rtAHR2β with the properties of rtAHR2α. All other known AHRs resemble rtAHR2α and carry glutamate at this position, located at the N terminus of the PAS-A domain. We tested the effect of altering this glutamate in the human and zebrafish AHRs to lysine. This lysine substitution produced AHRs with transactivation properties that were similar to rtAHR2β. These results identify a critical residue in AHR proteins that has an important impact on transactivation, enhancer site recognition, and regulation by ligand.

These proteins transduce signals generated by environmental stresses into transcriptional responses. These stresses range from hypoxia to xenobiotic compounds (1.Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 2.Rowlands J.C. Gustafsson J.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The AHR is activated by a structurally broad range of ligands. Among these, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is one of the most potent and well-studied agonists (3.Denison M.S. Heath-Pagliuso S. Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 1998; 61: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A broad spectrum of environmental contaminants, including TCDD, can produce toxic responses through activation of the AHR. Two hybrid and coprecipitation studies have revealed the presence of proteins that interact with AHR, including HSP90 and ARA9/AIP/XAP2 (4.Carver L.A. Jackiw V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30109-30112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

These chaperone proteins stabilize and hold AHR in a conformation that is better able to bind ligand (8.Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). TCDD binding causes the AHR protein to dissociate from cytosolic HSP90 and move into the nucleus where it forms a functional dimer with ARNT. This dimer then binds DNA to regulate the transcription of target genes. The AHR·ARNT dimer binds to specific enhancer elements that are often referred to asDioxin Response Elements, or DREs. The best-characterized DREs lie upstream of genes encoding cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) (9.Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 10.Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Following nuclear localization and DNA binding, AHR exits the nucleus and is then degraded by the proteasome pathway (11.Ma Q. Renzelli A.J. Baldwin K.T. Antonini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12676-12683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12.Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The AHR protein is composed of several functional domains. The N terminus contains a domain rich in basic amino acids followed by a helix-loop-helix domain that is conserved among a variety of DNA binding proteins. The basic domain is required for DNA binding, whereas the helix-loop-helix domain is involved in dimer formation with ARNT. The N terminus also contains nuclear localization (NLS) and export (NES) domains (15.Berg P. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43231-43238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol.

C-terminal to the bHLH domain is a pair of PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, that are conserved among a family of proteins. The PAS domains are named for several founding members of this protein family, Per, ARNT, andSim (1.Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). PAS domains act as regulated protein interaction surfaces and are involved in a wide variety of sensory/signaling processes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. These domains are involved in ligand binding to AHR, and the subsequent change in protein associations, subcellular location, and activity. The ligand-binding domain encompasses the PAS-B domain whereas HSP90 is thought to interact with the bHLH and PAS domains (17.Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

Holcombe G.W. Johnson R.D. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1998; 17: 472-483Crossref Google Scholar). AHR and ARNT proteins have been identified in a variety of fish species and presumably mediate these effects. The ability of ligands to activate the AHR pathway is similar to their ability to cause TCDD-like toxicity (23.Walker M.K. Peterson R.E. Aquat. Toxicol. 1991; 21: 219-238Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 24.Zabel E.W. Cook P.M. Peterson R.E. Aquat. Toxicol. 1995; 31: 315-328Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25.Zabel E.W. Pollenz R.

Generally, one AHR (AHR1) is more similar to the mammalian AHR and a second (AHR2) is fish-specific (26.Hahn M.E. Karchner S.I. Shapiro M.A. Perera S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ARNT isoforms have been cloned from Fundulus (ARNT2) rainbow trout (rtARNTa and b) and zebrafish (zfARNT2a, b, and c) (31.Pollenz R.S. Sullivan H.R. Holmes J. Necela B. Peterson R.E. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1494: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). No ARNT1 has been identified in fish. To date, salmonids are the group of fish species that are most sensitive to the effects of TCDD. Two AHR genes encoding rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β have been identified in rainbow trout. These two AHR isoforms are ∼98% identical in primary sequence. Despite this similarity in structure, the two proteins have distinct properties. In general, rtAHR2α has stronger transactivation properties than rtAHR2β. This is somewhat surprising in light of the fact that these two proteins are identical in sequence in the C-terminal domain that is thought to mediate transcriptional activation. In addition, rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β have different enhancer sequence requirements. rtAHR2β appears to be active with a more limited set of enhancer sequences than rtAHR2α. To explore the structural nature of these differences, we constructed a set of chimeric proteins in which segments of rtAHR2β were exchanged with the cognate sequence from rtAHR2α. These experiments indicate that the functional differences between rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β are conferred by a single amino acid difference corresponding to position 111 in rtAHR2β. COS-7 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), were maintained in 100% humidity in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 5%CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were split and plated at a density of 6.0 × 104cells/well of a 24-well plate 1 day prior to transfections. Y1 cells (mouse adrenal cortex cells) generously provided by Dr. Collin Jefcoate (University of Wisconsin) were maintained in Ham's F-10 media supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum.

Juvenile trout obtained from Ennis National Fish Hatchery (Ennis, MT) were euthanized with tricaine methanesulfonate (Argent, Redmond, WA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Whole fish were pulverized and total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH) as directed by the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated from RTG cell lysates using Qiashredder homogenizers (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was synthesized using 500 ng of total whole juvenile rainbow trout RNA or RTG cell RNA. Alpha- and beta-specific rtAHR sequences were amplified using αf and βf primers, respectively, and the P208 reverse primer. Amplification was conducted for 35 cycles under the following conditions: 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C, followed by a 7-min extension after the last cycle. Amplified products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β expression vectors (rtAHR2αORF and rtAHR2βORF, respectively) were created by amplifying the open reading frame of each gene using primers 5P-Sal and 3P-Xba with Pfu polymerase (Promega, Madison WI). The products of these reactions were digested with SalI and XbaI and subcloned into pBK-CMV previously digested with the same enzymes. The expression vector for ARNTb was supplied by Dr. Richard Pollenz (31.Pollenz R.S. Sullivan H.R. Holmes J. Necela B. Peterson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30886-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Zebrafish AHR2 and zebrafish ARNT2b expression constructs both in pBK-CMV have been previously reported (30.Tanguay R.L. Abnet C.C. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33.Tanguay R.L. Andreasen E. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A human AHR construct was made by digesting pSportAHR2 supplied by Dr. Chris Bradfield (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) with SmaI to release the coding sequence. This fragment was then ligated into pBK-CMV similarly digested with SmaI. The prt1Aluc luciferase reporter vector has been previously reported (27.Abnet C.C. Tanguay R.L. Hahn M.E. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15159-15166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Dr. Michael Denison (University of California, Davis, CA) generously provided the pGudluc1.1 luciferase reporter (34.Garrison P.M. Tullis K. Aarts J.M. Brouwer A. Giesy J.P. Denison M.S. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1996; 30: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). pBK-CMVrtAHRsrtAHR2α, pBK-CMVrtAHR2β, and pBK-CMVrtAHR2βK111E were used as templates for PCR to make C-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins for Western analysis. Each template was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase with EA-15f and rtAHRsFLAGr primers. PCR products were digested with BglII and XbaI and ligated into their corresponding pBK-CMVrtAHR2 vectors that were similarly digested. The sequence was verified for each clone. Plasmids rtAHR2αORF and rtAHR2βORF were digested with SalI and XbaI and temporarily subcloned into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) previously digested with SalI and XbaI. Six chimeric rtAHR2s were constructed by gel-purifying restriction digestion products of the pBluescript II SK rtAHR2 clones with a particular combination of SalI, SphI, BglII, and or XbaI (Fig. 1). Exchanging the BglII/XbaI digestion products produced Chimeras A and B. Chimeras C and D were constructed by switching the SalI/SphI digestion products. Chimeras E and F were constructed by exchanging the SphI/BglII digestion products. Chimera G was made as follows. The bHLH domain of rtAHR2α was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) with EA17r and 5P-Sal for 25 cycles as follows: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 68 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The product was then gel-isolated. The PAS-A domain of rtAHR2β was similarly amplified using EA17f and P208r and gel-isolated. The products of the preceding reactions were then combined and amplified under the same conditions for five cycles. Then primers 5P-SalI and P208r were added, and another 25 cycles of amplification were conducted. The product of this reaction was then digested with SalI and SphI and ligated into rtAHR2β in pBluescript II SK that was similarly digested. Chimera H was constructed similarly to Chimera G except the template rtAHR2s were reversed. The bHLH domain was amplified from rtAHR2β, and the PAS-A domain was amplified from rtAHR2α. The resulting product was ligated into the SalI/SphI sites of rtAHR2β in pBluescript II SK. Point mutations were made in the rtAHR2β expression vector by site-directed mutagenesis as follows. The template AHRwas amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase in two separate reactions. The forward mutant primer and the external reverse primer were used in one reaction and the forward external primer with the reverse mutant primer in another. The conditions for these reactions is a follows: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C for 25 cycles. The products were gel-isolated and combined for five cycles: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. External primers were then added to the reaction, and 25 more cycles were conducted under the same conditions. The amplified product was then gel-isolated and digested with SalI and SphI and ligated into rtAHR2β in pBSKII similarly digested. rtAHR2β chimeras and the point mutant clones were all subcloned into the SalI/XbaI site of pBK-CMV. The human AHRE114K and zebrafish AHR2E118K mutants were made under the same conditions as the trout mutants using species-specific primers. All chimeric and mutated AHRs were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequence analysis. Each modified AHR could be translated in vitro and produced a band of similar size and intensity as the wild-type AHR. COS-7 cells were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 6 × 10 4 cells per well 1 day prior to transfection. Transient transfection was conduced using SuperFect (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Each well was cotransfected with 400 μl of serum containing media, including wild-type or mutant AHR (450 ng), a species-specific ARNT (450 ng) expression vector, 100 ng of a luciferase reporter (prt1Aluc or pGudluc1.1), and a β-galactosidase CMV reporter (50 ng) for estimation of transfection efficiency. Y1 cells were plated at 8 × 104 cells per well and transfected with the indicated AHR (250 ng/well), luciferase reporter (200 ng/well). and β-galactosidase CMV reporter (100 ng/well). Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, 600 μl of fresh serum-containing media was added to each well. After 20-h incubation, cells were exposed to Me2SO vehicle control or TCDD previously dissolved in Me2SO (0.1% media volume). Cells were harvested after a 20-h incubation. Media were aspirated, and each well was washed with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 100 μl of lysis buffer was added to each well (100 mmKPO4, pH 7.8, 6 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mm ATP trihydrate), 10-μl aliquots of cell lysate were transferred to a 96-well luminometer, and 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) was injected into each well, incubated for 2 s, with the luminescence integrated over 10 s. Luciferase assays were completed using a Dynatech Laboratories ML-2250 luminometer (Chantilly, VA). β-Galactosidase activity was determined for each well as follows. 15 μl of cell lysate was aliquoted to a 96-well plate. 200 μl of reaction buffer (0.1 m NaPO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.385% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to each well followed by the addition of 40 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml). The reaction was then incubated at 37 °C for 2–4 h. Plates were read at 405 nm using a Bio-Tek Instruments ELx800 plate reader (Winooski, VT). Results are expressed as luciferase activity normalized to the β-galactosidase activity in each sample. The -fold induction was calculated by dividing the relative luciferase activity measured in the presence of TCDD by the activity measured in the corresponding vehicle-treated sample. COS-7 cells at 70% confluency were transfected with 5 μg of either pBK-CMV empty vector, rtAHR2αFLAG, rtAHR2βFLAG, or rtAHR2βK111EFLAG as described above. Whole cell lysate was harvested 20 h later. Briefly, the cells were rinsed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2PO4, 1.5 mm KH2P04, pH 7.4) containing EDTA and EGTA (1 mm each) and removed from the dish using a Teflon spatula, rinsed with 300 μl of extraction buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, 20 mmNa2MoO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A), and transferred to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube on ice. Cells were sonicated three times on ice and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 22,000 ×g for 30 min. 20 μg of lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-T (25 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h then washed three times with TBS-T. The FLAG epitope was then detected by incubation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) diluted in TBS-T (2 μg/ml) containing 1% dry milk. The antibody was removed after 2 h, and blots were washed with TBS-T three times. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Chicago, IL) diluted 1:4000 in TBS-T containing 5% dry milk was added for 1-h incubation. Blots were washed three times in TBS-T prior to chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β proteins are almost 98% identical in primary sequence yet have distinctly different properties. We used transient transfection assays in COS-7 cells to measure transactivation properties of these proteins, because these cells are devoid of endogenous AHR and express only a low amount of ARNT (35.Ema M. Ohe N. Suzuki M. Mimura J. Sogawa K. Ikawa S. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27337-27343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When assayed for reporter activation in a transient transfection assay using COS-7 cells and DRE-containing luciferase reporters, these proteins gave different results. When we used the prt1Aluc reporter construct, in which sequences from the rainbow trout CYP1A promoter are used to drive the luciferase reporter (36.Abnet C.C. Tanguay R.L. Heideman W. Peterson R.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 159: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), rtAHR2α produced a luciferase signal that was readily detected and sensitive to TCDD induction. In contrast, rtAHR2β produced only a low level of reporter activity, which was not increased by the addition of TCDD (Fig. 1). However, when we used pGudluc1.1, a reporter driven by mammalian sequences derived from the mouse cyp1A1 gene (34.Garrison P.M. Tullis K. Aarts J.M. Brouwer A. Giesy J.P. Denison M.S. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1996; 30: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), we observed a different response. In this case, both AHR proteins were able to produce a readily detected reporter signal that was induced by TCDD. Although rtAHR2α produced stronger transactivation with the pGudluc1.1 reporter than rtAHR2β, rtAHR2β was more responsive to TCDD, as indicated in the bottom right panel of Fig. 1. In this assay, rtAHR2α was induced ∼10-fold by TCDD, whereas the activity of rtAHR2β was induced by more than 50-fold, owing to the very low activity in the absence of TCDD. This rtAHR2β basal activity is close to the limit of detection, making calculated values for -fold TCDD induction of rtAHR2β somewhat variable. However, both the low basal activity and the high -fold induction by TCDD were consistently observed with this receptor. These results demonstrate several different properties of these receptor molecules: First, rtAHR2α appears to have stronger transactivation properties than rtAHR2β, producing more luciferase expression with either reporter construct. Second, when assayed with the pGudluc1.1 reporter, rtAHR2β is more tightly regulated by TCDD, owing to the very low basal activity. Finally, the two AHR proteins appear to have different requirements for DNA target sequences. To identify the domain that confers these differences in activity, we constructed chimeric rtAHR2 proteins by exchanging similar domains between rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β and measured the activities of these chimeras with prt1Aluc and pGudluc1.1. We then attempted to correlate the presence of a region from the α or β receptor isoforms with the different receptor characteristics. The C-terminal portions of the rtAHR2s are entirely conserved (Fig. 2), so our chimeras concentrated on the N-terminal half of the AHR proteins. The first set of chimeric proteins were made by taking advantage of conserved SphI and BglII restriction sites found in both rtAHR2α and rtAHR2β. These were used to transfer domains from rtAHR2α to rtAHR2β and vice versa (Fig. 3, and see Fig. 2). In chimeras A through F, the ability to produce a robust transactivation signal with the prt1Aluc reporter, a characteristic of rtAHR2α, was observed only in chimeras in which the N-terminal 250 amino acids were from rtAHR2α. Chimeras carrying rtAHR2β sequence in this region were relatively inactive with the prt1Aluc reporter. Similarly, the tight regulation by TCDD observed in rtAHR2β, characterized by very low basal expression and resulting high -fold induction by TCDD with the pGudluc1.1 reporter, correlated with the presence of the rtAHR2β sequence in this N-terminal SphI portion of the protein. In addition, the marked preference for pGudluc1.1, which characterizes rtAHR2β, was also conferred by this part of the protein.Figure 3TCDD responsiveness of rtAHR2 chimeras in a transient transfection assay.

https://openalex.org/W2094362955,"The development of red blood cells from hematopoietic progenitors requires the interplay of specific extracellular factors and transcriptional regulators. Here we have identified an erythroid progenitor that is critically dependent on bFGF and requires expression of AMV v-Myb for sustained proliferation in vitro, indicating that bFGF and Myb proteins cooperate in these cells. In the presence of bFGF such v-Myb cells are completely blocked in their ability to differentiate and exhibit an exceptionally high proliferative potential and long lifespan in vitro. Interestingly, in the absence of bFGF cells effectively differentiate into mature erythrocytes, irrespective of constitutive and elevated levels of v-Myb. We also demonstrate that these cells express high levels of FGF receptor type 1 (FGFR1) and that phospholipase C(gamma) (PLC(gamma)) is one of the important molecules in FGF receptor signaling. Our studies suggest that bFGF, in cooperation with Myb proteins, represents an important factor for determining erythroid lineage choice. These findings unravel a so far unidentified link between extracellular signaling and Myb in hematopoietic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2041531156,"The mature sporadic T-cell malignancy, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is remarkable for frequently harbouring somatic mutations of the Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) gene, ATM. Because some data suggest ATM is frequently rearranged in T-PLL, it was decided to investigate such rearrangements in detail by cloning breakpoints. Among 17 T-PLL tumour samples, three rearrangements were detected by Southern blotting. Two cases harboured a unique type of intragenic duplication in which breakpoints arose at the consensus sequence RGYW/WRCY. The third case harboured a large deletion terminating within the ATM gene. Also, 13 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples were examined and one sample harboured a deletion– insertion with the RGYW motif at the breakpoint in ATM. This is the first known deleterious mutation detected in ATM in T-ALL. Interestingly, the RGYW motif is the signal for a cell-cycle regulated DNA double strand break (DSB) that initiates somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin and, probably, T-cell receptor genes. The structures of the ATM duplications suggest they may arise from an error in somatic hypermutation. We suggest that aberrant components of somatic hypermutation may contribute to the defective DSB repair characteristic of cancer."
