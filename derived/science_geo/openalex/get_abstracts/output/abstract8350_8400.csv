https://openalex.org/W2046837952,The dopamine receptor blocker pimozide attenuated lever-pressing and running for food reward in hungry rats. In each case the characteristic behavior of pimozide-treated rats was the same as that of undrugged rats when reward was simply withheld. Drug-induced performance difficulties were ruled out by the presence of periods of normal responding in drug-treated animals. Pimozide appears to selectively blunt the rewarding impact of food and other hedonic stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W2037387800,"Golgi methods were used to examine the hippocampus of laboratory mice that received alcohol-containing or control diets for 4 months followed by a 2-month alcohol-free period. Long-term alcohol consumption resulted in a significant loss of dendritic spines on hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. This study provides evidence that long-term alcohol consumption, in the absence of malnutrition, produces morphological damage to the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2090610111,"Long-term treatment of rats with haloperidol produced an increased sensitivity to the locomotor and stereotypic effect of apomorphine. This behavioral dopaminergic supersensitivity was accompanied by increased binding of [3H] spiroperidol in the striatum. Rats treated concurrently with lithium and haloperidol failed to develop both behavioral sensitivity to apomorphine and increased striatal dopamine receptor binding. The ability of lighium to prevent recurrent manicdepressive episodes may be related, in part, to its ability to stabilize dopaminergic receptor sensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W2161207125,"Estrogen pretreated chick oviduct tissue can be restimulated in vitro by physiological concentrations of estrogen and progesterone. The rates of synthesis of the major egg white proteins, ovalbumin and conalbumin, as well as the cellular levels of their respective mRNAs, increase after characteristic lag periods; this confirms previously reported results in vivo and demonstrates that both the lag phenomena and the mRNA induction are a function of the direct interaction of steroids with oviduct cells. The antagonistic action of progesterone on an estrogen-mediated induction of conalbumin mRNA also occurs in vitro, and the kinetics of this response are examined. Progesterone terminates the estradiol-induced accumulation of conalbumin mRNA within 30 min after addition to the medium; progesterone alone or in combination with estrogen, however, is capable of inducing conalbumin mRNA after a 4 hr lag period. The temporary nature of this antagonism and the fact that it does not occur with ovalbumin induction indicate the complexity of the oviduct's response to steroids. The role of protein synthesis in the induction of both ovalbumin and conalbumin was examined by including protein synthesis inhibitors in the culture medium. Puromycin, cycloheximide, emetine, pactamycin and high salt all block the induction of both ovalbumin and conalbumin mRNA when added together with either estrogen or progesterone. The effect of puromycin is reversible. After the drug is removed from the medium, the mRNA accumulation begins with the same characteristic lag period seen when no inhibitors are added. When given 2 hr after estrogen, puromycin stops the accumulation of conalbumin mRNA within 30 min, whereas cycloheximide and emetine allow the mRNA to accumulate for another 2 hr before causing complete inhibition. There is no effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on the number of estrogen receptors localized in the nucleus. The data suggest a direct link between protein synthesis and the steroid-induced accumulation of specific mRNAs in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2169173740,"The steroid hormone estradiol, and the glycoprotein hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), are known to be essential for the growth and differentiation of follicles in the ovary. The present study was conducted to determine quantitatively the effects of estradiol, FSH and LH on proliferation of different ovarian cell types (granulosa and theca cells). The immature female hypophysectomized rate sequentially primed with estradiol, FSH and LH was used as the experimental model. Proliferation was assessed by examining changes in total DNA, incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA and labeling index in specific cell types. Estradiol and FSH each acted on follicles at different stages of development to stimulate proliferative activity of both granulosa and theca cells. Continued administration of either hormone caused a decrease in the proliferative activity of both cell types. These observations have been interpreted to indicate that estradiol and FSH can each alter the length of the specific phases of the cell cycle. A luteinizing dose of LH caused a cessation of proliferation in luteinizing granulosa cells while stimulating a limited proliferation of theca cells. Absence of the appropriate hormonal stimulus caused both granulosa and theca cells to stop proliferating and the follicles to undergo atresia. These results indicate that, depending upon the state of differentiation of granulosa and theca cells, estradiol, FSH and LH can stimulate or inhibit the ability of these cells to proliferate."

One of these antibodies was found to react only with mouse embryonal carcinoma cells and no other tumor cell type tested, including differentiated derivatives of teratocarcinomas. In the adult mouse, this antigen is expressed by subpopulations of cells in the spleen, bone marrow, lymph node, brain, kidney and testes, although not in liver and thymus. This antigen has a species and tissue distribution consistent with that of Forssman antigen. The molecules which carry this specificity on the embryonal carcinoma cells appear to be glycolipids."

The GC-rich half of the repeating unit contains a single long duplication of 174 nucleotides. The duplicated segment commences 73 nucleotides preceding the 5′ end of the gene and terminates at nucleotide 101 of the gene. The duplicated portion of the gene, termed the pseudogene, differs by 10 nucleotides from the corresponding portion of the gene, and the remaining duplicated sequence of 73 nucleotides differs by 13 nucleotides. The plasmid-cloned repeating unit differs from the dominant sequence in the total population of repeating units by 6 nucleotides in the GC-rich region. Evidence is provided that most of the CpG dinucleotides in 5S DNA are at least partially methylated."
https://openalex.org/W2076207372,"The primary sequence of the principal spacer region in X. laevis oocyte 5S DNA has been determined. The spacer is AT-rich and comprises half or more of each repeating unit. The sequence is internally repetitious; most of it can be represented by the following set of oligonucleotides: The spacer, which varies in length from about 360 to 570 or more nucleotides, can be subdivided into a region (A2) which is variable in length in different repeating units, flanked by regions (A1, A3, B1) which are relatively constant in length. The A2 region consists, on the average, of 5–6 tandem copies of the oligonucleotide CAAAGTTT-GAGTTTT; variation in the redundancy of this oligonucleotide accounts for much of the repeat length variation in the genomic 5S DNA. Most copies of this oligonucleotide are identical, although several differing by 1 or 2 nucleotides have been detected in plasmid-cloned 5S DNA fragments. Regions A1 and A3 comprise a linear array of similar, but not identical, oligonucleotides; most repeating units contain very similar A1 and A3 sequences. Region B1 is a sequence of 49 nucleotides immediately adjacent to the 5′ terminus of the 5S rRNA sequence. It is GC-rich, much less repetitive than the remainder of the spacer and contains several palindromes, but no regions of dyad symmetry. This sequence is identical in all six of the single cloned repeating units of 5S DNA analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2043603714,"The morphology of nucleolar and non-nucleolar (lampbrush chromosome loops) chromatin was studied in the electron microscope during states of reduced transcriptional activity in amphibian oocytes (Xenopus laevis, Triturus alpestris, T. cristatus). Reduced transcriptional activity was observed in maturing stages of oocyte development and after treatment with an inhibitor, actinomycin D. Strands of nucleolar chromatin appear smooth and thin, and contain only few, if any, nucleosomal particles in the transcribed units. This is true whether they are densely or only sparsely covered with lateral ribonucleoprotein fibrils. This smooth and non-nucleosomal character is also predominant in the interspersed, apparently nontranscribed rDNA spacer regions. During inactivation, however, nucleolar chromatin frequently and progressively assumes a beaded appearance in extended fibril-free—that is, apparently nontranscribed—regions. In either full-grown oocytes or late after drug treatment, most of the nucleolar chromatin is no longer smooth and thin, but rather shows a beaded configuration indistinguishable from inactive non-nucleolar chromatin. In many chromatin strands, transitions of fibril-associated regions of smooth character into beaded regions without lateral fibrils are seen. Similarly, in the non-nucleolar chromatin of the retracting lampbrush chromosome loops, reduced transcriptional activity is correlated with a change from smooth to beaded morphology. Here, however, beaded regions are also commonly found interspersed between the more or less distant bases of the lateral fibrils, the putative transcriptional complexes. In both sorts of chromatin, detergents (in particular Sarkosyl) that remove most of the chromatin proteins including histones from the DNA axis but leave the RNA polymerases of the transcriptional complexes attached were used to discriminate between polymerases and nucleosomal particles. The results suggest that nucleosomes are absent in heavily transcribed chromatin regions but are reformed after inactivation. In contrast to the findings with inactivated nucleolar genes, in lampbrush chromosome loops the beaded nucleosomal configuration appears to be assumed also in regions within transcriptional units that, perhaps temporarily, are not involved in transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2051710843,"‘NATURAL’ serum antibodies are thought to arise as a result of stimulation by environmental antigens. Evidence suggests, however, that many such antibodies in normal healthy individuals are specific for and may be induced by a variety of self components. Many of these autoantibodies are directed against ‘buried’ or ‘enzyme-revealed’ self antigens and include those specific for mouse reproductive organs which crossreact with human group A erythrocytes1, human and rabbit immunoglobulins treated with proteolytic enzymes2,3, denatured DNA4, enzyme-treated human lymphocytes and erythrocytes5–8, and mouse erythrocytes treated with the proteolytic enzyme bromelain9. This widespread occurrence of autoantibodies could suggest that the normal immune system is preoccupied in reacting against self antigens. One way of measuring the extent of this reactivity is to compare the number of B cells making a given autoantibody(s) with the total number of B cells producing immunoglobulin (Ig) irrespective of specificity. We have previously shown that normal conventional and germ-free mice possess in their spleens considerable numbers of PFC against bromelain-treated isologous mouse erythrocytes (BrM), an ‘internal’ antigen of mouse erythrocytes9,10. We have measured the proportion of Ig-secreting cells in the lymphoid organs of normal CBA/H mice forming PFC against BrM and found that in some (but not all) major lymphoid organs between 1% and >50% of the existing or potential Ig-secreting cells are specific for BrM."

https://openalex.org/W1575474218,"Abstract Rabbit skeletal alphaalphatropomyosin was specificially labeled at cysteine 190 with the fluorescent reagent, N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. Spectroscopically different products were obtained by labeling at pH 6.0 (PyrI-alphaalphaTm) or pH 7.5 (PyrII-alphaalphaTm). PyrII-alphaalphaTm results from a secondary reaction between the N-(1-pyrene)succinimido moiety at cysteine 190 of PyrI-alphaalphaTm and a lysine group on the same chain, probably lysine 189. Pyrene excimer fluorescence was present in the native state but absent in the unfolded state of both products, thus verifying the proximity of the--SH groups and the chain register model for the structure of tropomyosin. Studies of the guanidinium chloride-dependent unfolding of PyrII-alphaalphaTm showed that loss of excimer fluorescence precedes unfolding, providing evidence for a region of preferential instability in the molecule near cysteine 190. This work suggests that N-(1-pyrene)maleimide could be used to probe both--SH proximity and local conformation in any protein if the presence of two or more proximal--SH groups is suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2010953853,"The retinal pigment epithelium of RCS rats, previously thought not to phagocytize photoreceptor outer segments, exhibited a peak of phagocytosis in vivo when animals were kept under conditions of cyclic lighting (12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of light). The peak occurred at 1 hour after the onset of light, with maximum and minimum levels of phagocytosis averaging about 5 percent of that found in the pigment epithelium of Osborn-Mendel rats used as a control. Eyecups that were obtained from Osborn-Mendel rats and maintained for up to 3 hours in organ culture demonstrated levels of phagocytosis that were sevenfold greater than those of unincubated controls. Likewise a tenfold increase occurred in incubated as opposed to unicubated RCS eyes, raising the possibility that phagocytosis could be experimentally stimulated in vivo."

These observations provide biochemical evidence that epidermal cells grown in culture synthesize the major differentiation products of the epidermis."

The lengths of the monomers in the aggregates and the average spac- ing of monomers on the central filament of hyaluronic acid were determined. The Gaussian distribution of core lengths for the bovine cartilage sample (343 + 95 nm) was significantly different from the distributions observed for the chick samples. With the exception of the sample derived from Day 16 cultures, all the chick samples gave statistically identical Gaussian distribu- tions (-310 f 60 nm). The Day 16 monomer core length distribution was somewhat skewed toward shorter lengths (297 + 58 nm). The average spacing of mono- mers on hyaluronic acid was larger for a reconstituted aggregate sample from Day 8 culture than for a prep- aration isolated from a similar culture by a procedure which did not involve dissociation of the aggregate structure. In all samples, the number of monomers per aggregate was linearly correlated with the length of hyaluronic acid in the central filament. Chondrocyte cultures were double-labeled with [3H]serine and [14C]serine on Day 8, or on Day 16, or both. Sepharose 2B analyses of the monomer fractions indicated that monomers synthesized on Day 16 had significantly smaller average sizes than those synthe- sized on Day 8. Further, although only 50% of the monomers synthesized on Day 8 remained in the tissue matrix on Day 16, the remaining molecules exhibited an identical size distribution to that of proteoglycans synthesized by Day 8 cultures and isolated directly. Differences in the average sizes of the chondroitin sul- fate chains in the monomer samples account in large part for the smaller sizes of the Day 16 macromolecules. Cartilage proteoglycan monomers consist of a protein core with covalently bound polysaccharide chains of chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate. The protein core of these macro- molecules can be divided into three regions; a chondroitin sulfate-enriched region, an intermediate keratan sulfate-en- riched region, and a hyaluronic acid binding region which is located at one end of the molecule (l-4).

https://openalex.org/W2472839243,"The relative rate of de novo synthesis of two membrane-associated carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBP) has been examined during Dictyostelium development. The results show that the relative rate of CBP synthesis is minimal during the vegetative stage and increases to represent approximately 3.5 to 5% of newly synthesized protein during the aggregation stage after which the relative rate decreases. Analysis of the relative rates of synthesis of CBP-26 and CBP-24 indicate that at the peak period of synthesis (approximately 5 to 9 h of development) CBP-26 is synthesized at a rate which is approximately eight times greater than CBP-24. In addition, we have examined the relative amount of CBP-26 and CBP-24 mRNA during development as assayed by its ability to direct CBP synthesis in in vitro protein-synthesizing systems. We show that there is no detectable CBP mRNA in vegetative cells and that during the pre-aggregating stages, assayable CBP mRNA appears and accumulates with a maximal level at the period of peak in vivo CBP synthesis. These results suggest that the rate at CBP synthesis in vivo is controlled by the relative amount of functional mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1977364026,"Abstract Evidence for two types of chromatin binding sites for the estradiol-receptor complex was found in target nuclei using micrococcal nuclease digestion. Nuclei from rat uteri, which had been incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 −8 M 3 H-estradiol, produced monomer (nu 1 ) and short oligomer nubodies which contained significantly higher specific activities of 3 H-estradiol/nu-body than the bulk chromatin. The specific activities decreased from nu 1 to nu 2 to nu 3 , and more extensive digestion produced nu-bodies with lower specific activities. 3 H-estradiol-containing nu-bodies sedimented slightly faster than bulk particles. The bound estradiol could be released from the nu-bodies with 400 mM KCl, producing a 5.3S estradiol-receptor complex similar to the activated form of receptor released by salt from uterine nuclei of steroid-treated animals. Concomitant with the appearance of 3 H-estradiol-enriched nu-bodies, micrococcal nuclease also released from the chromatin an estradiol-receptor complex which sedimented at 6.9S in low salt and 5.3S in high salt. This moiety may be bound to a small fragment of DNA since receptor released from chromatin by DNAase I sedimented at 6.0S rather than at 6.9S. It is possible that the binding of estradiol to chromatin, which is known to turn on specific gene transcription in vivo, induces or reflects a local conformational alteration which we detect as an enhanced sensitivity to nuclease, and which is recognized intracellularly as a start signal for transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1998392079,"The sequence complexity of total RNA from separated blastomeres of 16-cell sea urchin embryos was assayed by RNA excess hybridization using a single-copy DNA probe (+egg DNA) for those egg RNA sequences that are transcribed from single-copy DNA. RNA from whole 16-cell embryos, from gastrulae, and from pooled mesomeres and macromeres reacted with +egg DNA to 90% of the extent of the egg RNA/+egg DNA reaction. Total RNA from micromeres, however, reacted only to 67–80% of the extent of hybridization shown by 16-cell embryo RNA, gastrula RNA or meso-macromere RNA with +egg DNA. The same results were obtained with RNA from blastomeres or whole embryos developing under a transcription block imposed by actinomycin D. Hybridization of blastomere RNAs to a single-copy DNA probe not homologous to egg RNA sequences (−egg DNA) showed, as do the data on complexity of RNA from embryos grown in actinomycin D, that participation of newly synthesized or nuclear RNA was quantitatively insignificant in setting saturation levels observed in the blastomere RNA/+egg DNA hybridizations. These data therefore indicate that at the 16-cell stage and probably even earlier, there is a large asymmetry of informational RNA sequences between the micromeres and other parts of the embryo. They suggest strongly that the asymmetry resides in RNA which was present in the egg before fertilization-that is, in “maternal” RNA."

Restraint of separated pups also elicits an unusually high incidence of gastric erosions, as well as insomnia and an increase in quiet wakefulness. If hypothermia during restraint is prevented, neither the erosions nor the behavioral responses occur. Rat pups separated at the customary age (postnatal day 22) do not become hypothermic during restraint, and the restraint of such pups is not associated with either gastric erosion or insomnia."

https://openalex.org/W2171496447,"Chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis was studied in embryonic chicken sternum, with particular attention paid to the effect of environmental sulfate (SOd2-) concentration on the structure of newly formed chondroitin sulfate. Sternal cartilages were labeled in vitro with [3H]glucosamine in the presence of varying concentrations of inorganic sulfate, and the structure of labeled chondroitin sulfates was studied. At sulfate concentrations higher than 30 pM, the labeled product was found in a peak centered in the position of standard (fully sulfated) chondroitin sulfate when fractionated on a DEAE-cellulose column by elution with a linear gradient of NaCl. At sulfate concentrations lower than 0.3 PM, however, the highest radioactivity appeared in an area expected for essentially unsulfated chondroitin. At intermediate sulfate concentrations, 3 to 10 PM, the product was found in essentially two separate peaks rather than in a peak at intermediate position; the first peak appeared in the area for unsulfated chondroitin and the second just before but overlapping fully sulfated chondroitin sulfate. Analyses by digestion with chondroitinase indicated that the degree of sulfation is a principal parameter involved in the elution profiles of DEAE-cellulose chromatogram. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]sulfate did not demonstrate any precursor-product relationships between the fractions of different sulfation degree. Fractionation of a [3H]glucosamine-labeled cartilage showed that the low sulfated [3H]chondroitin is present almost exclusively in the extracellular matrix. The results are compatible with the hypothesis (provided by DeLuca, S., Richmond, M. E., and Silbert, J. E. (1973) Biochemistry 12,3911-3915) that sulfation during polymerization of chondroitin occurs in an “all or nothing” rather than a random fashion, and further suggest that the relative proportion of low and high sulfated chondroitin chains attached to core protein of proteoglycan may be regulated, in part at least, by environmental sulfate concentration."

At high sodium chloride, the maximal velocities of the different substrates varied over 27-fold, while at low sodium chloride, less than a 5-fold variation was observed. Dead-end inhibition studies using acetylaminocholine as the inhibitor showed that under conditions of high sodium chloride, inhibition changes from noncompetitive to competitive as the reactivity of the substrate decreases. Under conditions of low sodium chloride, acetylaminocholine inhibition is nonlinear and noncompetitive with respect to all substrates tested. These results suggest that increased ionic strength increases the rate of coenzyme A dissociation from the enzyme. The rate-determining step of the reaction can be ternary complex interconversion, coenzyme A release, or both, depending on the ionic strength and the substrate employed."

The requirements for alpha-ketoglutarate and Fe2+ were very stringent. During the course of the 2' -hydroxylase and 7-hydroxylase reactions, alpha-ketoglutarate was decarboxylated to form succinate and CO2 so that the ratio of hydroxylated nucleoside or pyrimidine to CO2 was 1:1.5-Hydroxymethyluracil and 5-formyluracil also stimulated the decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate and thus appeared to undergo 7-hydroxylase reactions."
