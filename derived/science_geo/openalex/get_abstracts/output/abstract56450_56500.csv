https://openalex.org/W1542775374,"Abstract The following trisaccharide unit terminates the oligosaccharide chains of several plasma glycoproteins: sialic acid → galactose → N-acetylglucosamine → oligosaccharide → protein. Previous studies showed that this trisaccharide unit was synthesized by the sequential action of three glycosyl-transferases isolated from goat colostrum; each glycosyltransferase catalyzed the transfer of a monosaccharide residue (N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, or sialic acid) from its nucleotide derivative to the appropriate glycoprotein acceptor. The present studies are concerned with the intracellular location of these glycosyltransferases in rat liver. Kinetic studies were first performed to establish optimum conditions for determining quantitatively the particle-bound rat liver glycosyltransferases; these enzymes exhibited similar properties to the soluble, partially purified glycosyltransferases previously obtained from goat colostrum. The subcellular localization of the enzymes was then investigated by two techniques, differential centrifugation and discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In these studies, the following were used as markers for various subcellular organelles: DNA, RNA, glucose 6-phosphatase, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, acid phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, and glutamic dehydrogenase. The results indicated that the glycosyltransferases were all located in the same membranous subcellular component and that this component was different from organelles containing the above marker substances; the active subcellular particle was characterized by electron microscopy as being rich in Golgi apparatus. The apparent location of the glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus suggests that these enzymes may be involved in terminating the synthesis of plasma glycoproteins by the liver during secretion, and may possibly be required for secretion of these proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1581434205,"Abstract Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (3',5'-AMP) was assayed in calvaria isolated from fetal rats at term. A marked increase in 3',5'-AMP was detected in vitro within 1 min after adding purified parathyroid hormone to calvaria incubated in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate or Krebs-Ringer-Tris buffer. A maximal effect was detected after 5 min of incubation with added parathyroid hormone. The lowest concentration of parathyroid hormone causing a significant effect was 0.05 µg per ml or 5 x 10-9 m. The response was a direct function of the log concentration of parathyroid hormone from 0.1 to 1.0 µg per ml, became maximal at 10 µg per ml, did not require potassium, magnesium, or calcium in the incubation medium, and was not inhibited by a high (5 mm) concentration of calcium. Epinephrine and prostaglandins E1 and E2 also caused a significant increase in skeletal 3',5'-AMP. The effect of epinephrine was abolished by propranolol, but this β-adrenergic blocking agent did not affect the response to the prostaglandins or to parathyroid hormone; phentolamine did not affect the response to any of these substances. Calcitonin caused a slight increase in skeletal 3',5'-AMP, but the maximal effect was small and the response was not related to the concentration of polypeptide. Only the effect of parathyroid hormone was clearly relatable to direct hormonal activation of adenyl cyclase in the tissue. Neither thyrotropin, corticotropin, glucagon, insulin, luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, nor sodium fluoride affected the concentration of 3',5'-AMP in this test system. These findings provide further evidence that the physiological actions of parathyroid hormone are mediated by 3',5'-AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1575441322,"The cell wall of Diplococcus pneumoniae was isolated and purified and its macromolecular components were characterized in two ways: (a) by selective extractions and (b) by solubilization of the wall with the pneumococcal autolytic enzyme followed by fractionation of the enzyme products. Two major macromolecular components could be identified. One, the peptidoglycan, is composed of glucosamine, muramic acid (plus muramic acid phosphate), lysine, alanine, and glutamic acid in the molar ratios of 1.0:1.2:1.5:3.8:2.0. The presence of additional amino acids, namely, aspartic acid, serine, glycine, and threonine in the molar ratios (with respect to glucosamine) of 0.9:1.0:1.0:0.5 was also detected. The other major component, teichoic acid, is rich in galactosamine, phosphate, and choline which occur in the molar ratios 1.0:1.65:0.9. These three constituents together make up 23% of the cell wall mass. After treatment of cell walls with cell-free pneumococcal autolytic enzyme, most of the cell wall material can be recovered in the form of two soluble macromolecular fractions which are separable by gel filtration. Fraction I is of high molecular weight and contains teichoic acid polymers plus what appears to be the polysaccharide backbone of the peptidoglycan. Fraction II contains material of lower molecular weight and is rich in the amino acids lysine, glutamic acid, and alanine; these amino acids appear to represent cross-linked dimers and trimers of the peptide portion of the peptidoglycan. The teichoic acid and the polysaccharide components of Fraction I can be separated after sequential degradation with nitrous acid and periodate. It has already been proposed in the literature that the antigenic C-polysaccharide of pneumococcus is a teichoic acid. Our studies further indicate that this teichoic acid contains choline and is a major structural component of pneumococcal cell wall. The major autolytic activity in pneumococcal extracts appears to be an amidase which splits the bond between muramic acid and alanine in the peptidoglycan portion of the cell wall. Experiments are described which indicate that the lysis of pneumococci by deoxycholate occurs through the participation of this enzyme. The choline component of the teichoic acid plays a key role in determining sensitivity to the autolytic enzyme, since walls prepared from pneumococci in which cell wall choline was replaced by ethanolamine were found to be totally resistant to the action of the autolytic enzyme."

We now show that thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase from yeast can function as hydrogen carriers in both types of reactions and it is suggested that they form part of both enzyme systems."
https://openalex.org/W2138142730,"Abstract Rat adrenal steroidogenesis has been measured in a system consisting of mitochondria, microsomes, succinate, Mg++, TPNH, DPN+, and phosphate. With incubations at 20°, the rate of corticosterone formation has been found to be biphasic with a rapid primary rate lasting for about 4 to 6 min, followed by a slower secondary rate which continues for at least another 15 min. Of the two subcellular fractions, the mitochondrial fraction is the rate-limiting one. Administration of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) 15 min before killing the experimental animals resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the primary rate of corticosterone synthesis. The increase was due to changes which occurred only in the mitochondria; microsomes from ACTH-treated and control animals were identical in their activity. The direct assay of the reactions involved in corticosterone synthesis, that is, the synthesis of pregnenolone, the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone, the transformation of progesterone to deoxycorticosterone, and the 11-hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone showed that only the synthesis of pregnenolone in the mitochondria was increased by ACTH. In addition, the rate of pregnenolone synthesis was the slowest reaction, even after ACTH stimulation. Mitochondria were pretreated by exposure to water and the inclusion of Ca++ in the incubation medium. Pretreated mitochondria from both control and ACTH-treated rats showed greater rates of pregnenolone synthesis than the corresponding intact mitochondria. Prior administration of cycloheximide to the rats eliminates the ACTH-induced increase in pregnenolone synthesis in the intact mitochondria. However, if the ACTH-treated mitochondria are pretreated, then cycloheximide has no effect on their activity, and the activity is equal to that of pretreated, ACTH-treated mitochondria. The other mitochondrial activity studied, 11-hydroxylation, is not affected. These data indicate that ACTH stimulation of pregnenolone synthesis does not involve an increase in the amount of an enzyme which directly participates in pregnenolone synthesis but does involve an increase in the activity of such an enzyme. Adrenal mitochondria from ACTH-treated rats are more sensitive to swelling agents than mitochondria from control animals. The hypothesis that ACTH controls steroidogenesis by determining the rate of efflux of mitochondrial pregnenolone and hence the extent of the feedback inhibition by pregnenolone of its own synthesis is found to be consistent with the data obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1593076558,"Abstract Transient formation of phospholipid peroxides was observed during the TPNH-dependent cleavage of phospholipid-bound polyunsaturated fatty acids in liver microsomes. The peroxide functions are associated with the β position polyunsaturated fatty acids and appear to be intermediates in the chain cleavage process. The data support the conclusion that microsomes contain an enzyme system which promotes multiple peroxidative cleavage of endogenous membrane-bound polyunsaturated fatty acids, producing a variety of carbonyl-containing residues. Concomitant with the alteration of the membrane-bound phospholipids, there is evidence for major structural changes in the membrane itself. The reaction may represent an explicit metabolic function for unsaturated phospholipids during electron transport in the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as a possible alternative pathway for polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation. On the other hand, the changes observed may be the result of chemical damage to the microsomal membrane as a consequence of TPNH-linked electron transport."

https://openalex.org/W1523556299,"Abstract Differential spectroscopic studies of complexes between glutamate dehydrogenase and its various substrates, reaction products, cofactors, regulatory nucleotides, and analogues of these compounds have permitted direct observation of the interactions of individual chromophoric groups of a given ligand with other ligands on the enzyme surface and with that surface itself. This ability to resolve multiple modes of binding into their individual components and comparison of the concentration dependence of these specific interactions with reaction kinetics lead to a model capable of explaining the complex effects of ligands on the reaction. The model represents an active patch of enzyme surface no larger than 12 by 25 A containing an array of six subsites each capable of binding a more or less specific functional group. These subsites and their respective specifications are Subsite I, which binds an intact amide group of nicotinamide as well as an adenosine group; Subsite II, which is specific for some portion of the pyrophosphate-ribose moiety of the adenylate group; Subsite III, which binds only a 5'-substituted pyrophosphate group of adenosine analogues; Subsite IV, which binds ammonium ion and the -NH3+ group of amino acids; Subsites Vα and Vγ, which are specific for carboxyl groups; Subsite VI, which binds the pyrophosphate group of GTP. Each ligand binding site is formed from some combination of these subsites; the complexity of the interactions results from the ability of some ligands to bind to more than one combination of subsites and from the fact that some subsites are common to two different ligands. TPNH binds to Subsites I and II, and the bound coenzyme itself contains all or some part of Subsites IV and Vα, explaining the obligatory order of the reaction and the cooperative binding of TPNH and l-glutamate. ADP and DPNH bind to Subsites I and III, accounting for the activation of the reaction by those ligands. GTP binds to Subsite VI and competes with ammonium for Subsite IV. While ADP and GTP share no single common subsite, their ligand sites cross in such a way that the two ligands mutually exclude each other by steric hindrance, demonstrating an allosteric effect not mediated by a conformational change. The model also provides a detailed and straightforward explanation of the differences in the kinetics of the reaction with TPN, DPN, 3-acetylpyridine DPN, and NMN."
https://openalex.org/W1498215943,"Abstract Microsomal preparations from mouse brain were found to synthesize 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (2-amino-1-hydroxy-octadecan-3-one) from l-serine and palmitoyl coenzyme A. The reaction appeared to require pyridoxal phosphate but no metal ion. In the presence of TPNH the major sphingolipid product was dihydrosphingosine; smaller amounts of N-acyldihydrosphingosine and N-acylsphingosine were also found. The kinetics of utilization of 14C-palmitoyl-CoA indicated that accumulation of dihydrosphingosine was followed by acylation to form the ceramide. Sphingosine, which was not accumulated in detectable amounts, was apparently acylated much more rapidly. Stearoyl-CoA also reacted, producing the corresponding C20-sphingolipids, but oleoyl-CoA and lignoceroyl-CoA were inactive. At the optimal acyl-CoA concentration, stearoyl-CoA was less than half as effective as palmitoyl-CoA in the formation of ketodihydrosphingosine. The various labeled sphingolipids formed were separated by thin layer chromatography in several systems and identified by radioautography; acetyl and dinitrophenyl derivatives were also chromatographed. Of particular value was the use of borate-containing thin layer plates, which effectively separated fatty acyl sphingosine from fatty acyl dihydrosphingosine."
https://openalex.org/W1581911902,"Microsomal enzymes from Ehrlich ascites tumors synthesized O-alkyl glyceryl ethers from hexadecanol and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the presence of ATP, CoA, and Mg++. Glyceryl ether synthesis occurred via the formation of O-alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate and O-alkyldihydroxyacetone. Although NADPH inhibited the initial reaction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate with fatty alcohol, it was required at a later stage for reduction of the ketone intermediates to 1-O-alkylglycerophosphate and 1-O-alkylglycerol. 1-O-Alkylglycerophosphate was acylated by endogenous fatty acids in the Ehrlich ascites microsomes to form 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl glycerophosphate. In contrast, no acylation of 1-O-alkylglycerol occurred. The formation of an O-alkyl analogue of phosphatidic acid suggests that O-alkyl glycerolipids are synthesized by the well known cytidine pathway. The O-alkylglycerols were identified as isopropylidene derivatives and as O-alkyl glycolic aldehydes after periodate oxidation. The biosynthesis of O-alkyl ether bonds was measured as a function of time, pH, and the concentrations of protein, 1-14C-hexadecanol, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, Mg++, ATP, CoA, and NADPH. The Ehrlich ascites microsomes contained a triose phosphate isomerase, which we were unable to remove. We showed that dihydroxyacetone phosphate is the obligate precursor of glyceryl ethers in this system by inhibiting the isomerase with 1-hydroxy-3-chloro-2-propanone phosphate. O-Alkyldihydroxyacetone was identified by the following methods: periodate oxidation to O-alkyl glycolic acid; reduction to O-alkyl glyceryl ethers by LiAlH4, hydrogenation, NaBH4, and NADPH (enzymatically); reduction by LiA1H4 of the O-alkyl glycolic acid (derived from O-alkyl dihydroxyacetone) to O-alkyl ethylene glycol; and identification of the acetate derivative of the O-alkyl ethylene glycol. 1-O-Alkyl-2-acyl glycerophosphate was identified by the following methods: mild saponification to 1-O-alkylglycerophosphate; more drastic saponification to alkyl glyceryl ether; treatment by LiA1LH4 to yield alkyl glyceryl ether; hydrolysis with phospholipase A to yield 1-O-alkylglycerophosphate; and thin layer chromatography in acidic and basic solvent systems. O-Alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate was identified by the following methods: removal of the phosphate by bacterial alkaline phosphatase to yield O-alkyldihydroxyacetone and subsequent identification of the O-alkyldihydroxyacetone; reduction by LiA1H4 to alkyl glyceryl ether; thin layer chromatography in acidic and basic solvent systems; and enzymatic reduction by NADPH to 1-O-alkylglycerophosphate. An equimolar incorporation of hexadecanol and dihydroxyacetone phosphate into the ether-containing intermediates and glyceryl ethers was shown with 14C-, 3H-, and 32P-labeled substrates. Data obtained with 1-14C, 1-3H-hexadecanol showed that no oxidation of the alcohol occurred during formation of ether bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1565730309,"Abstract The studies reported herein further define the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase in hepatoma tissue culture cells, a tissue culture line developed from a rat hepatoma. These studies show that: 1. Tyrosine aminotransferase induction is due to an increase in the rate of synthesis, as shown by specific immunochemical precipitation of the enzyme labeled in vivo, confirming earlier findings. 2. There are no detectable nonantigenic precursors of tyrosine aminotransferase; hence synthesis seems to be from free amino acids. 3. Removal of the glucocorticoid from fully induced cells results in a prompt fall in tyrosine aminotransferase activity and a decline in its rate of synthesis. This decrease in activity is accompanied by a loss of antigenic activity of tyrosine aminotransferase, indicating that the enzyme is converted or degraded to a nonantigenic form. 4. After addition of inducer, a lag period of about 2 hours is observed before tyrosine aminotransferase activity begins to increase. In several experiments, the rate of synthesis was seen to increase more rapidly than the rise in catalytic activity, but only after a 60- to 90-min lag. Enzyme-forming potential is enhanced within 30 min after addition of the inducer and is the earliest effect of glucocorticoid hormones yet detected in this induction system."
https://openalex.org/W1547670096,"Abstract Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli is purified about 170-fold. The purified enzyme has no absolute requirement for divalent metal ions for activity. However, it is activated by Mg++, spermidine, or a number of other polycations. The apparent activation constant for spermidine is approximately 0.2 mm. In the presence of saturating concentrations of spermidine or other polycations, Mg++ ions have no further stimulatory effect. The enzyme is inhibited in an allosteric manner by DPNH and this inhibition is not reversed by DPN+, AMP, or spermidine. Compounds of physiological interest related to DPNH (ATP, GTP, acetyl coenzyme A, and coenzyme A) do not cause any inhibition. The initial velocity plots of the enzyme follow the Michaelis-Menten equation in the absence of DPNH. In its presence, however, the velocity versus substrate plots for TPN+ become sigmoidal (but remain hyperbolic for glucose-6-P as the variable substrate). Inhibition against both of the substrates of the enzyme by DPNH is noncompetitive. In addition, the inhibition curves for DPNH are also sigmoidal, suggesting a multisite binding of the inhibitor on the enzyme surface. A comparison is made between the kinetic characteristics of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase and different enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in E. coli which have been demonstrated to be inhibited by DPNH, and it is pointed out that they all have one property in common, viz. that the rate-concentration plots for only one of the reactant substrates are sigmoidal in the presence of the inhibitor. The physiological implications of such kinetic behavior are discussed and it is concluded that the oxidative pentose pathway serves primarily to generate reducing power (TPNH) for biosynthetic purposes."

https://openalex.org/W1533953083,"Abstract The TPN+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (NCA 2184) has been isolated and purified approximately 1000-fold. The preparation described is homogenous as judged by sedimentation equilibrium and disc gel electrophoresis. The weight average molecular weight estimated by sedimentation equilibrium analysis is 92,500. In 6 m guanidine hydrochloride-1 mm dithiothreitol, the weight average molecular weight is about 45,000 indicating the presence of two subunits. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is not exceptional in terms of the amounts of nonpolar or other amino acids when compared with mesophilic isocitrate dehydrogenases. The Km values for TPN+ and d-isocitrate in triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.5, at 50° were 4.5 µm and 6 µm, respectively; in phosphate buffer the corresponding values were 15 and 27 µm. The enzyme was completely inactive when tested with DPN+ as cofactor. Magnesium, or more effectively, manganous ion satisfies the metal ion requirement of the enzyme. The temperature optimum for activity is about 66°. The Arrhenius activation energy was determined to be 25 kcal per mole. The enzyme is stable at 60°, and for short times at 70° when protected by isocitrate and magnesium. Incubation in 8 m urea at room temperature results in rapid inactivation. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and EDTA inhibit the isocitrate dehydrogenase. p-Chloromercuribenzoate inhibition is reversed with cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W82466380,"Abstract Orally administered ferric citrate exerts a pronounced synergistic effect on the induction of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase produced by two compounds. The effect appears to be specific for iron citrate, as opposed to other metals in complex with citrate, and specific also in affecting the level of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase as compared with another induced enzyme, tyrosine transaminase. Inorganic iron salts did not produce augmentation of the induction of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. The data suggest that iron augments the rate of synthesis of the enzyme during induction rather than activating or stabilizing the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1601712016,"Abstract O-Alkyldihydroxyacetone-P and O-alkyldihydroxyacetone were identified as intermediates in the biosynthesis of O-alkyl-linked lipids. The substrates for the initial reaction are dihydroxyacetone-P and fatty alcohols, and the cofactor requirements are coenzyme A, ATP, and Mg++. The enzyme complex that carries out this reaction was found in microsomes of preputial gland tumors. The keto-intermediates were identified by thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography of derivatives and standards prepared by the following techniques: LiAlH4 reduction, periodate oxidation before and after LiAlH4 reduction, acid and alkaline hydrolysis, and removal of the phosphate moiety by bacterial alkaline phosphatase. We analyzed the fatty alcohols and O-alkyl ethylene glycols resulting from these treatments as the acetates; the O-alkylglycerols were identified as the isopropylidene derivatives. Both keto-intermediates can be enzymically reduced with NADPH. After reduction of the ketone group of the phosphorylated intermediate, acylation can result in the formation of diacyl glyceryl ethers."

https://openalex.org/W1529168762,"Abstract A 2'-AMP-activated pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been purified to apparent homogeneity and crystallized. The enzyme has a typical flavoprotein absorption spectrum. The spectrum is partially bleached by the anaerobic addition of TPNH and the bleaching is accompanied by increases in longer wave length absorption. Subsequent addition of DPN+ reverses the bleaching. The enzyme catalyzes reduction of dichloroindolphenol and potassium ferricyanide by TPNH and DPNH, and this reduction by DPNH is activated by 2'-AMP. If sedimentation in the analytical ultracentrifuge is monitored with schlieren optics or with a spectrophotometric scanning device measuring flavin absorption, a heterogeneous, aggregated system in the absence and an apparently homogenous system in the presence of 2'-AMP or TPN+ are observed. Incubation of the enzyme at 51° in the presence of TPNH or treatment of the enzyme with acidic ammonium sulfate causes a loss of activity. Addition of FAD, but not flavin mononucleotide, restores activity. The above evidence indicates that the transhydrogenase is a flavoprotein and suggests that the natural cofactor is FAD. The sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that under the conditions of observation the purified enzyme is very large. At a concentration of 8 mg per ml and in the presence of 2'-AMP or TPN+ the transhydrogenase sediments with an s20,w of 33.8. p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate can cause both inhibition and activation of the enzyme and protection against these effects is afforded by substrates. 2'-AMP activates several reactions in which the reducing substrate does not contain a 2'-phosphate group. When TPNH at about 3 x 10-4 m is the reducing substrate there is no activation by 2'-AMP. 2'-AMP enhances the rate of anaerobic reduction of enzyme-bound flavin by DPNH. This effect was observed at high concentrations of enzyme and may reflect the ability of 2'-AMP to disaggregate the enzyme, yet not necessarily reflect the mechanism by which 2'-AMP activates reactions in which only catalytic concentrations of enzyme are present. The enzyme has been tested for its ability to catalyze reduction or oxidation of a large number of physiological, nonpyridine nucleotide substrates. All substrates tested were inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1531832028,"Abstract Dehydrogenase and decarboxylase activity are both lost as a result of incubation of TPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The rate of inactivation is decreased 450-fold by isocitrate in the presence of MnSO4, indicating a specific reaction at the active site of the enzyme. No other substrates or coenzymes significantly decrease the reaction rate, although TPNH plus MnSO4 have been shown to protect against the reaction of essential sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The larger derivative of NEM, N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide, also inactivates the enzyme, but protection in that case is provided by TPNH plus MnSO4, suggesting that steric factors may account for the different results with the three reagents. Inactive NEM-enzyme retains the ability to bind 1 mole each of radioactive isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate. Inactivation must therefore be attributed to disruption of a catalytic step subsequent to the adsorption of these substrates. Partially inactive NEM-enzymes exhibit a 3- to 4-fold increase in the Michaelis constants for isocitrate and oxalosuccinate, whereas the Km values for other substrates are normal. In addition, an increase of 0.3 logarithmic unit is noted in the pK of an essential ionizable group in the enzyme-substrate complex. Enzyme incubated with NEM in the presence of isocitrate and manganous ions retains full activity but still exhibits abnormal Km and pK values. Reaction of 1 functional group (A) may thus be responsible for inactivation, while modification of a second group (B) may cause the changes in the kinetic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W1504468997,"Abstract 1. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase is a microsomal enzyme system which is inducible by polycyclic hydrocarbons in hamster fetal cells grown in culture. While the specific activity of hydroxylase increases more than 20-fold in 21 hours, there are increases of 80%, 40%, and 100% in the total heme, cytochrome b5, and total CO-binding pigment, respectively, in the microsomal membranes of these cells. 2. There is no significant difference between the extinction coefficient for the microsomal reduced hemoprotein-CO complex from control cells and that from benz[a]anthracenetreated cells. 3. A microsomal cytochrome, the reduced hemoprotein-CO complex of which absorbs maximally at about 446 nm, is closely associated with aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in that the appearance of the cytochrome is (a) dependent upon protein synthesis and (b) not dependent upon the intracellular presence of benz[a]anthracene per se. 4. Increases in microsomal oxygenase activity and cytochrome concentrations, which are observed in microsomal fractions of hamster fetal cells exposed to inducer, are similar in magnitude to those found in fetal liver when the pregnant rat is treated with benz[a]anthracene. 5. The P450 from control cells is more easily converted to P420 by experimental manipulations such as vigorous homogenization and incubation in vitro with KSCN, compared to the CO-binding pigment from benz[a]anthracene-treated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1495832331,"Abstract Incubation of the TPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from pig heart with 1-14C-N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) leads to inactivation and altered Michaelis constants for isocitrate and oxalosuccinate concomitant with incorporation of 2 moles of reagent. Reaction of enzyme with radioactive NEM in the presence of isocitrate and Mn++ yields a catalytically functional enzyme, with the same altered Michaelis constants, which also contains 2 moles of reagent. Inactive enzyme with a single carboxymethyl methionyl residue exhibits the same ability to bind radioactive NEM as does native enzyme; however, prior inactivation by reaction of 5 sulfhydryl groups with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) prevents binding of NEM. Cysteine is the sole type of amino acid modified in the inactive NEM-enzyme, as determined by paper chromatographic identification of radioactive cysteinosuccinic acid and S-(N-ethylsuccinimido)cysteine in acid and proteolytic digests of 14C-labeled modified enzyme. Thirteen moles of cysteic acid are found after performic acid oxidation of native enzyme, the same as the number of free —SH groups observed by reaction with DTNB after denaturation; therefore, no disulfide bonds are present in isocitrate dehydrogenase. A decrease in the number of measurable —SH groups after reaction with NEM is consistent with modification of cysteinyl residues. By contrast, the recovery of NH2-terminal alanine after the Edman reaction was approximately the same for native and modified enzyme. Inactive enzymes with a single carboxymethyl methionyl residue, with 2 or 5 altered sulfhydryl groups, give a reaction of antigenic identity to that of native enzyme as measured against rabbit antibody to isocitrate dehydrogenase. The molecular size of the inactive NEM-enzyme is the same as that of native enzyme, as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, and the rates of proteolytic digestion by Pronase are not significantly different. These data argue against a generalized structural change in the modified enzyme. However, a small conformational change is indicated by a decrease in the reaction rate of DTNB with the residual —SH groups of the inactive NEM-enzyme. The magnitude of conformational change is not directly related to loss in enzymatic activity, since an observed decrease in the amplitude of the optical rotatory dispersion curves is greater for active NEM-enzyme ([α]234 -5610°) than it is for inactive NEM-enzyme ([α]234 -7430°), as compared to native isocitrate dehydrogenase ([α]234 -8050°). These results, in conjunction with those of the preceding paper, suggest that, in the absence of isocitrate and MnSO4, modification of Sulfhydryl Group A produces inactivation, whereas modification of Sulfhydryl Group B leads to a small conformational change which is reflected in altered Michaelis constants. In the presence of substrates, NEM reacts with 2 sulfhydryl groups, including Group B but not Group A, which produces a further change in the conformation of the enzyme but no concomitant change in the kinetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1506735270,"Abstract Multivalent anions, sulfate, phosphate, or arsenate, selectively decrease the rate of alkylation of rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by both iodoacetamide and iodoacetate. N-Acetylation of the lysine residue that in the apoenzyme neighbors the essential cysteine residue does not eliminate this anion effect, suggesting that an alternative unique enzyme site is responsible for binding these anions. NAD+ (or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide) at high concentration strikingly reverses this effect with iodoacetate; with iodoacetamide a further retardation in alkylation rate is observed. It is proposed that binding of NAD+ limits access of iodoacetamide or other uncharged reagents to the active site sulfhydryl group and simultaneously produces, via the pyridinium cation, a site capable of binding iodoacetate or any other negatively charged reagent. The role of NAD+ in acyl phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl hydrolase activities is considered in this context. The dependence on coenzyme concentration of the alkylation reaction for both reagents was determined with apoenzyme in various media. The results at low NAD+ concentrations in the presence of a multivalent anion indicate that a given coenzyme molecule facilitates, by means of the specific coulombic interaction, carboxymethylation (and not carbamylmethylation) at each of the sites to which it is bound during the reaction period. Finally the possible use of NAD+ (NADP+) as an active site director is commented upon in terms of modifying enzymatic behavior in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1488030047,"Abstract The binding of NADPH to pigeon and rat liver fatty acid synthetases has been examined by the techniques of fluorescence enhancement, fluorescence polarization, and equilibrium dialysis. Pigeon and rat liver fatty acid synthetases increase the fluorescent yield from NADPH 4.6- and 3.8-fold, respectively. Fluorescent yield appears to be independent of the buffer concentration and the amount of coenzyme bound to enzyme. The number of binding sites on each synthetase is independent of the protein concentration. The pigeon liver enzyme binds 2 moles of NADPH per mole of enzyme in 0.2 m phosphate and 3 moles of coenzyme at lower buffer concentrations. The binding affinity for NADPH is independent of the quantity of coenzyme bound; however, binding of coenzyme is competitive with charged species supplied by the buffer. The Kd value in 0.2 m phosphate is 8 µm, and in 0.1 m phosphate it is 3.5 µm. The rat enzyme binds maximally 4 moles of NADPH per mole of enzyme in 0.2 m and in lower buffer concentrations. This enzyme has either two pairs of binding sites or it exhibits negative cooperativity. The affinity of binding of NADPH to each of these pairs of sites is dependent upon the buffer concentration. The dissociation constant for the stronger pair of binding sites is 1 µm in 0.2 m phosphate and less than 1 µm at lower buffer concentrations. Neither the binding of NADPH to protein nor enzyme activity for fatty acid synthesis requires phosphate. Fatty acid synthesis proceeds most rapidly at ionic strengths higher than those yielding the strongest NADPH binding. The binding affinity of the pigeon liver enzyme for NADPH is not changed by the binding of either acetate or malonate (from their respective CoA esters) to protein, thereby indicating a separate binding site for NADPH. It is not affected either by a pH change in the region where the rate of fatty acid synthesis changes rapidly. It is also not changed appreciably by dissociation (with Tris-glycine buffer) of the enzyme complex into half-molecular weight units, a condition that completely eliminates fatty acid synthesis. The binding capacity of the enzyme for NADPH is destroyed by extensive sulfhydryl oxidation and by alkylation with iodoacetamide. It is suggested that the binding of NADPH to enzyme is primarily electrostatic and that it is dependent on one or more sulfhydryl groups. It is not, however, dependent on the noncovalent binding forces responsible for maintaining the integrity of the enzyme complex."

Roth, of the family Convolvulaceae, which is found in abundance along the warmer seashores of both hemispheres, is used as a medicant in many parts of the world. The leaves are usually used—either boiled for external appfication as an anodyne in colic or rheumatism, or powdered and incorporated in an ointment said to have good local effects on bedsores—but they may also be used as an escharotic in the treatment of ulcers. Previous reports1,2 suggest that the extracts of the plant have no pharmacological effects."
https://openalex.org/W1509197721,"Abstract A specific reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate-linked 5-keto-d-fructose reductase has been isolated and purified approximately 300-fold from extracts of bakers' yeast. The reaction catalyzed by the enzyme was found to be 5-Keto-d-fructose + NADPH + H+ → l-sorbose + NADP+ Km values for NADPH and 5-keto-d-fructose were 4.6 x 10-5 m and 1 x 10-3 m, respectively. All attempts to demonstrate reversibility of the reaction were unsuccessful. Although l-sorbose, at exceedingly high concentrations, does not affect the rate of NADPH oxidation by 5-keto-d-fructose, NADP+ was found to be a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 1.3 x 10-4 m. Of all other substrates examined, only 5-keto-d-fructose phosphate was active. The Km value for the phosphate ester was found to be 2.9 x 10-4 m with a maximal rate of reduction of only 1.8% of that observed for 5-keto-d-fructose. It has been established that the yeast reductase as well as sheep liver NAD-specific sorbitol dehydrogenase and Candida utilis NADP-specific polyol dehydrogenase catalyze a stereospecific direct transfer of hydrogen from the A side of the reduced pyridine ring to the ketohexose substrates."

When polyadenylic acid plus the eight naturally occurring deoxyribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleotides are added to cell suspensions, the percentage of total DNA in the complex increases with incubation time. This increase is not observed in unsupplemented cell suspensions. However, the percentages of RNA, protein, and phospholipid do not increase with incubation time in either supplemented or control complexes. A variety of deoxyribonucleotide kinases and the DNA polymerase are also detected in the DNA-membrane complex, and their specific activities are greater in complexes extracted from supplemented cell suspensions than in those extracted from controls."
https://openalex.org/W2049811853,"TYROSINE aminotransferase in the rat liver is subject to regulation by a number of hormones and amino-acids1–3. Recent work has indicated that the sympathetic neuro-transmitter norepinephrine suppresses the synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase by forming a complex with the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor (refs. 4–6 and I. B. B., manuscript submitted for publication). Evidence suggesting mediation of this effect by peripheral autonomic nerves has been presented7. Because many of the physiological consequences of sympathetic stimulation are antagonized by parasympathetic discharge with acetylcholine release, the effect of cholinergic agents on enzyme regulation was examined. I report here that the cholinergic agent carbachol (carbamylcholine) induces hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase and that this induction is antagonized by the cholinergic blocking agent atropine."

Rous sarcoma virus also failed to induce tumors in the runt and control animals. Breast carcinomas, presumably due to contamination of the inoculums with mammary tumor virus, occurred in those experimental groups given parental cells, whether or not they were viable or immunologically competent. We found no evidence that the immunologic process-as represented by the graft-versus-host reaction-is causally related to the induction of neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W1546882679,"Abstract The presence of α-ketoglutarate or other α-keto acids during homogenization of chick embryo liver largely prevented the decrease in tyrosine aminotransferase activity which otherwise occurred. This decrease in activity generally occurred when the specific activity of the enzyme in a 20,000 x g supernatant fraction prepared in the absence of α-keto acids was relatively low (2 to 6 milliunits per mg). Pyridoxal phosphate alone only partially stabilized the enzyme under these conditions but increased recovery when added together with α-ketoglutarate. In some instances, activity was the same in the presence or absence of α-ketoglutarate, and in such cases the specific activity of the enzyme was rather high (13 to 22 milliunits per mg). Passage of the 20,000 x g supernatant fraction through a Bio-Gel P-10 column converted tyrosine aminotransferase to the apoenzyme form to the extent of 90 to 95%. The enzyme then became heat-labile, losing approximately 40% of its activity during heating at 45° for 3.5 min. Under these conditions, the addition of the monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic α-keto acids not only completely protected the enzyme activity but in addition activated the enzyme to varying degrees. Activation did not occur at 0°. The amino acid substrates, l-tyrosine and l-glutamate, were completely ineffective in protecting the enzyme. Similar results were obtained upon heating the enzyme at 60° for 5 min. The extent of activation appeared to depend on the specific activity of the enzyme: the lower the activity, the greater the degree of activation. The effect of pyridoxal phosphate was variable and appeared to be independent of the action of α-ketoglutarate. The fact that α-ketoglutarate almost completely protected and also activated apoenzyme suggests that the keto acid is not acting by converting phosphopyridoxamine enzyme to phosphopyridoxal enzyme but by some other mechanism. The concentrations of α-keto acids required to give half-maximal stabilization during homogenization or half-maximal protection during heating were 1 order of magnitude lower than the apparent Km values for these α-keto acids. These results suggest that α-keto acids stabilize tyrosine aminotransferase during homogenization and protect it during heating by a similar mechanism and also that the binding site involved in these processes may be different from the catalytic binding site. On the basis of observations made during these studies, it is suggested that chick embryo tyrosine aminotransferase may exist in vivo in two forms differing in activity and stability. The relationship between these postulated forms and the forms that we have observed in vitro is discussed."
