https://openalex.org/W2155369114,"Cognitive decline is commonly observed in advanced aging even in the absence of disease. Here we explore the possibility that normal aging is accompanied by disruptive alterations in the coordination of large-scale brain systems that support high-level cognition. In 93 adults aged 18 to 93, we demonstrate that aging is characterized by marked reductions in normally present functional correlations within two higher-order brain systems. Anterior to posterior components within the default network were most severely disrupted with age. Furthermore, correlation reductions were severe in older adults free from Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as determined by amyloid imaging, suggesting that functional disruptions were not the result of AD. Instead, reduced correlations were associated with disruptions in white matter integrity and poor cognitive performance across a range of domains. These results suggest that cognitive decline in normal aging arises from functional disruption in the coordination of large-scale brain systems that support cognition."

Somatosensory input is often the result of self-generated movement during the active touch of objects, and conversely, sensory information is used to refine motor control. There must therefore be important interactions between sensory and motor pathways, which we chose to investigate in the mouse whisker sensorimotor system. Voltage-sensitive dye was applied to the neocortex of mice to directly image the membrane potential dynamics of sensorimotor cortex with subcolumnar spatial resolution and millisecond temporal precision. Single brief whisker deflections evoked highly distributed depolarizing cortical sensory responses, which began in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex and subsequently excited the whisker motor cortex. The spread of sensory information to motor cortex was dynamically regulated by behavior and correlated with the generation of sensory-evoked whisker movement. Sensory processing in motor cortex may therefore contribute significantly to active tactile sensory perception."

We report crystal structures of CO dehydrogenase II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans in three different states. In a reduced state, exogenous CO 2 supplied in solution is bound and reductively activated by cluster C. In the intermediate structure, CO 2 acts as a bridging ligand between Ni and the asymmetrically coordinated Fe, where it completes the square-planar coordination of the Ni ion. It replaces a water/hydroxo ligand bound to the Fe ion in the other two states. The structures define the mechanism of CO oxidation and CO 2 reduction at the Ni-Fe site of cluster C."
https://openalex.org/W2003578537,"Both limiting and toxic soil concentrations of the essential micronutrient boron represent major limitations to crop production worldwide. We identified Bot1, a BOR1 ortholog, as the gene responsible for the superior boron-toxicity tolerance of the Algerian barley landrace Sahara 3771 (Sahara). Bot1 was located at the tolerance locus by high-resolution mapping. Compared to intolerant genotypes, Sahara contains about four times as many Bot1 gene copies, produces substantially more Bot1 transcript, and encodes a Bot1 protein with a higher capacity to provide tolerance in yeast. Bot1 transcript levels identified in barley tissues are consistent with a role in limiting the net entry of boron into the root and in the disposal of boron from leaves via hydathode guttation."
https://openalex.org/W2091456307,"The establishment of functional neural circuits requires the guidance of axons in response to the actions of secreted and cell-surface molecules such as the semaphorins. Semaphorin 3E and its receptor PlexinD1 are expressed in the brain, but their functions are unknown. Here, we show that Sema3E/PlexinD1 signaling plays an important role in initial development of descending axon tracts in the forebrain. Early errors in axonal projections are reflected in behavioral deficits in Sema3E null mutant mice. Two distinct signaling mechanisms can be distinguished downstream of Sema3E. On corticofugal and striatonigral neurons expressing PlexinD1 but not Neuropilin-1, Sema3E acts as a repellent. In contrast, on subiculo-mammillary neurons coexpressing PlexinD1 and Neuropilin-1, Sema3E acts as an attractant. The extracellular domain of Neuropilin-1 is sufficient to convert repulsive signaling by PlexinD1 to attraction. Our data therefore reveal a ""gating"" function of neuropilins in semaphorin-plexin signaling during the assembly of forebrain neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2087356150,"GABA transporters play an important but poorly understood role in neuronal inhibition. They can reverse, but this is widely thought to occur only under pathological conditions. Here we use a heterologous expression system to show that the reversal potential of GAT-1 under physiologically relevant conditions is near the normal resting potential of neurons and that reversal can occur rapidly enough to release GABA during simulated action potentials. We then use paired recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons and show that GABAergic transmission is not prevented by four methods widely used to block vesicular release. This nonvesicular neurotransmission was potently blocked by GAT-1 antagonists and was enhanced by agents that increase cytosolic [GABA] or [Na+] (which would increase GAT-1 reversal). We conclude that GAT-1 regulates tonic inhibition by clamping ambient [GABA] at a level high enough to activate high-affinity GABAA receptors and that transporter-mediated GABA release can contribute to phasic inhibition.

Many synaptic physiologists view GABA transporters as always operating in uptake mode, continuously working at their maximum rate of uptake, and being capable of nearly completely eliminating all GABA from the extracellular space. However, this view is not consistent with the thermodynamics of transporters. Instead, it is well known that transporters can reverse (Attwell et al., 1993Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M.

Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and there is a theoretical limit to how much they can reduce ambient [GABA] (Attwell et al., 1993Attwell D. Barbour B.

However, there is theoretical and indirect experimental evidence that the membrane potential at which GABA transporters reverse is close to the normal resting potential of neurons. For example, GAT-1 (the neuronal isoform of the GABA transporter) can be induced to reverse in hippocampal cultures by a small depolarization of membrane potential caused by 6 mM K+ (Wu et al., 2001Wu Y.

The reversal potential of an electrogenic transporter can be calculated if its stoichiometry is known (Aronson et al., 2003Aronson P.S. Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. Physiology of membranes.in: Boron W.F.

For GAT-1, which is believed to undergo coupled translocation of Na+, Cl−, and GABA in a ratio of 2:1:1 (Kanner and Schuldiner, 1987Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. Mechanism of transport and storage of neurotransmitters.CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Lu and Hilgemann, 1999Lu C.C. Hilgemann D.W. GAT1 (GABA:Na+:Cl−) cotransport function. Steady state studies in giant Xenopus oocyte membrane patches.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the theoretical reversal potential is close to the normal resting potential of neurons when ambient [GABA] is 0.1–0.4 μM (Attwell et al., 1993Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Nonvesicular release of neurotransmitter.Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, Richerson and Wu, 2003Richerson G.B. Wu Y. The dynamic equilibrium of neurotransmitter transporters: Not just for reuptake anymore.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). If true, this is surprising because it suggests that GAT-1 would stop taking up GABA even though ambient [GABA] is high enough to activate high-affinity GABAA receptors (Saxena and Macdonald, 1996Saxena N.C. Macdonald R.L. Properties of putative cerebellar γ-aminobutyric acidA receptor isoforms.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 567-579PubMed Google Scholar), and thus GAT-1 would not be capable of lowering ambient [GABA] enough to eliminate tonic inhibition of neurons expressing these receptors. Determining whether these calculations of reversal potential are accurate is important because it allows predictions about the behavior of GAT-1 and its role in synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibition. Several groups have directly measured transporter currents to determine whether GAT-1 operates as predicted by classical models (Cammack et al., 1994Cammack J.N. Rakhilin S.V. Schwartz E.A.

Steady states, charge movements, and rates for a cloned GABA transporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes.Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Using this approach, it has been verified that the magnitude of GAT-1 transporter currents is altered in response to changes in sodium, chloride, and GABA gradients as would be predicted if GABA translocation is coupled to 2 Na+ and 1 Cl− (Lu and Hilgemann, 1999Lu C.C. Hilgemann D.W. GAT1 (GABA:Na+:Cl−) cotransport function. Steady state studies in giant Xenopus oocyte membrane patches.J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the methods used to make these measurements were relatively insensitive, making it necessary to use nonphysiological concentrations of substrate (e.g., 120 mM intracellular [Na+], 60 mM intracellular [Cl−], and/or 2 mM extracellular [GABA]) to increase the size of transporter currents. It has not yet been possible to measure the reversal potential of GAT-1 using this approach under physiological conditions. Recordings of transporter current also do not directly measure GABA flux, and there can be Na+ flux in the absence of GABA flux (i.e., uncoupled current) (Cammack et al., 1994Cammack J.N.

GABA flux has been measured directly using biochemical and radioactive assays (Belhage et al., 1993Belhage B. Hansen G.H. Schousboe A.

Multiple components of synaptosomal [3H]-gamma-aminobutyric acid release resolved by a rapid superfusion system.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but these assays of GABA release do not allow reversal potential to be determined. A variety of indirect methods have also been used to determine how easily GAT-1 will reverse (Wu et al., 2001Wu Y. Wang W. Richerson G.B. GABA transaminase inhibition induces spontaneous and enhances depolarization-evoked GABA efflux via reversal of the GABA transporter.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2003Wu Y. Wang W. Richerson G.B.

The transmembrane sodium gradient influences ambient GABA concentration by altering the equilibrium of GABA transporters.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 2425-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but these lack the experimental control needed to quantify the reversal potential. Here we describe an assay to measure the reversal potential of a GABA transporter. One set of CHO cells was transfected with GAT-1 (“GAT-1 cells”). Another set of CHO cells was transfected with high-affinity GABAA receptors (“sniffer cells”) and was used to detect GABA release from the GAT-1 cells. Using this approach, we demonstrate that GAT-1 behaves as predicted by classical models, reverses under physiological conditions, and is more dynamic than commonly believed. We then used paired recordings from hippocampal neurons in culture to demonstrate that these results are relevant to normal GAT-1 function. In this preparation, we found that IPSCs still occur after blocking vesicular neurotransmission, and this is due to GAT-1 reversal. Taken together, these results indicate that GAT-1 plays an important role in regulation of tonic inhibition and identify a primitive form of neurotransmission that can maintain phasic inhibition when there is failure of vesicular neurotransmitter release. GABAA receptors that include the δ subunit are highly sensitive to low levels of GABA (EC50 0.2–0.4 μM) and have relatively little desensitization (Bianchi et al., 2002Bianchi M.T. Haas K.F. Macdonald R.L. α1 and α6 subunits specify distinct desensitization, deactivation and neurosteroid modulation of GABAA receptors containing the δ subunit.Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Saxena and Macdonald, 1996Saxena N.C. Macdonald R.L. Properties of putative cerebellar γ-aminobutyric acidA receptor isoforms.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 567-579PubMed Google Scholar). The δ subunit is coexpressed with α6 subunits in cerebellar neurons, where it plays an important role in mediating tonic inhibition (Brickley et al., 2001Brickley S.G. Revilla V. Cull-Candy S.G. Wisden W. Farrant M. Adaptive regulation of neuronal excitability by a voltage-independent potassium conductance.Nature. 2001; 409: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the high affinity of δ subunit-containing GABAA receptors to measure transporter-mediated GABA release using a functional assay. Patch-clamp recordings were made in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode (holding potential = −60 mV) from CHO cells transfected with the α6, β3, and δ subunits of the GABAA receptor. In successfully transfected (green fluorescent protein [GFP]-expressing) sniffer cells, bath application of GABA at 0.1 μM induced a current (−871 ± 82 pA; n = 5; ECl = 0 mV) (see Figure S1A available online) that was blocked by bicuculline (50 μM) (−24 ± 12 pA; n = 5). This current was not induced in CHO cells that underwent the transfection procedure but did not express GFP (−3 ± 5 pA; n = 5). Patch-clamp recordings were also made from a separate set of CHO cells transfected with GAT-1 cDNA. These GAT-1 cells were lifted off their coverslip and positioned so they were touching the surface of sniffer cells (Figure 1A). For this first set of experiments, the electrode (intracellular) solution used for recording from the GAT-1 cell contained 30 mM Na+, 30 mM Cl−, and 5 mM GABA, concentrations that were chosen to be higher than physiological to increase the chance of reversal so that we could determine whether our approach was feasible. An example of a voltage-clamp recording from a sniffer cell under these conditions is shown in Figure S1B. An inward current was induced in the sniffer cell when the GAT-1 cell was voltage clamped at a potential of −60 mV, and this current increased when the membrane potential of the GAT-1 cell was increased. The response of the sniffer cell was dependent upon the proximity of the GAT-1 cell, because the current induced in the sniffer cell decreased when the two cells were moved apart from each other, and increased when they were brought back together (n = 6). Progressively more depolarizing voltages applied to the GAT-1 cell (−80 mV to +40 mV) led to progressively larger inward current in the sniffer cell (Figure 1B; −1002 ± 174 pA at +40 mV; n = 11). The response was blocked by bicuculline (50 μM; 8% ± 4% of control; n = 9; p < 0.001), indicating that it was due to activation of GABAA receptors. CHO cells do not contain synaptic vesicles or the vesicular GABA transporter vGAT, so the response was not due to vesicular GABA release. The response was also not calcium dependent, since the sniffer cell response in Ringer with 0 mM Ca2+ was 91% ± 11% of that in normal Ringer (n = 9; p > 0.05). Instead, the inward current was blocked by the GAT-1 antagonist SKF-89976a (40 μM; 4% ± 1% of control; n = 8; p < 0.001). There was no response when CHO cells were used that underwent the transfection procedure for GAT-1 but did not express GFP (n = 5). We conclude that the response in the sniffer cell was due to activation of GABAA receptors by GABA released from the GAT-1 cell via transporter reversal. Previous experiments have measured reversal potentials by directly recording transporter currents in cells transfected with GAT-1 (Cammack et al., 1994Cammack J.N. Rakhilin S.V. Schwartz E.A.

We found that approach to be much less sensitive than measuring GABA release using the sniffer cell assay. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from GAT-1 cells using an electrode solution containing 15 mM Na+, 10 mM Cl−, and 2 mM GABA (Figure 1C)—intracellular concentrations that have been reported by others to occur in some adult mammalian neurons (Otsuka et al., 1971Otsuka M.

Delpire E. Cortical neurons lacking KCC2 expression show impaired regulation of intracellular chloride.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As GAT-1 cells were depolarized using a voltage-ramp protocol (Figure 1D, top panel), a large inward current developed in neighboring sniffer cells (peak current 336 ± 46 pA, n = 8; Figure 1D, middle panel, black trace). At the same time, there was a leak current measured in GAT-1 cells during the ramp protocol (Figure 1D, bottom panel, black trace). SKF-89976a (40 μM) completely blocked the inward current in sniffer cells (5% ± 4% of control; n = 8; p < 0.001) (Figure 1D, middle panel, blue trace). However, there was not a consistent effect of SKF-89976a on the leak current in the GAT-1 cells (change in slope conductance of GAT-1 cells induced by SKF-89976a = −0.09 ± 0.10 nS; Figure 1D, bottom panel, blue trace; n = 6; p > 0.05). This indicates that the current mediated by GAT-1 is too small to be detected by directly recording from the GAT-1 cell (consistent with previous reports, as discussed above). However, GAT-1 reversal could be monitored indirectly by detecting GABA efflux using our sniffer cell assay. We next determined the minimum voltage at which GAT-1 reversal could be detected under the physiologically relevant conditions used in the previous experiment. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from GAT-1 cells using the electrode solution with 15 mM Na+, 10 mM Cl−, and 2 mM GABA and a bath solution with 151 mM Na+, 135 mM Cl−, and 0.1 μM GABA. A slow ramp depolarization was repeated three to six times, and the mean sniffer cell current was plotted (Figure 2A, black trace). A moving average was then calculated from the mean current (Figure 2A, green trace). The voltage in the GAT-1 cell at which an increase in inward current was first detected in the sniffer cell (i.e., ambient [GABA] first began to rise) was estimated to be the reversal potential for GAT-1. For the recording in Figure 2A, the reversal potential measured using this method was −69.5 mV. For recordings from 12 cell pairs, the mean reversal potential under these conditions was −67.1 ± 6.47 mV, which was close to the theoretical reversal potential of −68.2 mV (see Experimental Procedures). Thus, as predicted, the reversal potential of GAT-1 under these physiologically relevant conditions is near the normal membrane potential of many neurons. This may be surprising, because it indicates that GAT-1 would be at equilibrium under resting conditions, and there would be no GABA uptake, even when ambient [GABA] is near the normal level of around 0.1 μM (see Discussion). As shown in Figure S1A and previously (Bianchi et al., 2002Bianchi M.T. Haas K.F. Macdonald R.L. α1 and α6 subunits specify distinct desensitization, deactivation and neurosteroid modulation of GABAA receptors containing the δ subunit.Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Saxena and Macdonald, 1996Saxena N.C. Macdonald R.L. Properties of putative cerebellar γ-aminobutyric acidA receptor isoforms.Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 567-579PubMed Google Scholar), this [GABA] is high enough to activate high-affinity GABAA receptors. Thus, GAT-1 would not normally be able to eliminate tonic inhibition even in the absence of synaptic GABA release. The uncoupled mode described for GAT-1 involves sodium flux in the absence of GABA transport (Krause and Schwarz, 2005Krause S. Schwarz W. Identification and selective inhibition of the channel mode of the neuronal GABA transporter 1.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1728-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether GAT-1 can operate in an uncoupled mode in which GABA flux occurs in the absence of Na+ and Cl− transport, and there have been no methods previously available to determine whether this is true under near-physiological conditions. If GABA transport is always coupled to Na+ and Cl−, then the equations for the driving force on the transporter should accurately predict changes in the reversal potential of GAT-1 in response to changes in the transmembrane gradients for Na+, Cl−, and GABA (Aronson et al., 2003Aronson P.S.

We measured the reversal potential of GAT-1 while systematically varying [Na+], [Cl−], or [GABA] in the whole-cell patch-clamp electrode solutions used to record from different cells. The reversal potential of GAT-1 shifted progressively to more negative values as intracellular [Na+] increased (Figure 2B). The experimentally measured reversal potential of GAT-1 shifted from −24.2 mV to −84.2 mV as intracellular [Na+] was changed from 5 mM to 20 mM (Figure 2C). The change in reversal potential was measured to be −99.7 mV per 10-fold change in [Na+]i (calculated as the slope of the linear regression), compared to the predicted value of −117.1 mV. The difference was due to a small divergence from the theoretical prediction at 5 mM, which was likely due to instability of the recording at higher membrane potentials. Similar experiments were performed using different concentrations of chloride in the pipette solution. There was a shift in reversal potential of GAT-1 from −32.7 mV to −92.2 mV as intracellular [Cl−] was changed from 2 mM to 20 mM (Figure 2D). Note that the reversal potential is more steeply dependent on the sodium gradient than the chloride gradient, since there are twice as many Na+ ions transported per translocation cycle. Theoretical calculations predict that there is a −58.5 mV shift in reversal potential with a 10-fold change in the chloride gradient, which was close to the experimentally measured value of −58.7 mV. Even though GABA carries no net charge, a change in the GABA concentration gradient would be expected to shift the reversal potential of GAT-1 if GABA transport is obligately coupled to 2 Na+ and 1 Cl−. As predicted, a change in intracellular [GABA] from 0.5 mM to 2 mM led to a shift in the experimentally measured reversal potential of GAT-1 from −35.6 mV to −67.1 mV (Figure 2E). The shift in reversal potential was found to be −50.7 mV per 10-fold change in the GABA gradient, which was close to the theoretical value of −58.5 mV. Our sniffer cell assay only allowed us to measure GABA efflux, and not influx, requiring that we extrapolate our measurements to estimate the reversal potential. This may have led to an error, but the close correlation with the theoretical reversal potential suggests that the error was small, probably because the GABA receptor subunits we used were able to detect GABA release from the GAT-1 cell soon after it began to occur. If there was an error, our approach provides an upper limit for the reversal potential, making our finding of a low reversal potential even more significant. We cannot rule out the possibility that an uncoupled Na+ current (Krause and Schwarz, 2005Krause S. Schwarz W. Identification and selective inhibition of the channel mode of the neuronal GABA transporter 1.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1728-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) occurred in our experiments, since our assay would not detect it. However, our results do indicate that GAT-1 does not allow spontaneous GABA efflux via a channel-like mode, as occurs with the dopamine transporter in response to amphetamine (Kahlig et al., 2005Kahlig K.M. Binda F. Khoshbouei H. Blakely R.D. McMahon D.G. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Amphetamine induces dopamine efflux through a dopamine transporter channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and when GABA flux does occur it remains coupled to 2 Na+ and 1 Cl− when the substrates are near physiological concentrations. We next examined how rapidly GAT-1 reverses. Recordings were made from CHO cells in voltage-clamp mode at a holding potential of −60 mV using an electrode solution containing 30 mM Na+, 30 mM Cl−, and 5 mM GABA. The bath solution contained 151 mM Na+, 135 mM Cl−, and no GABA. A large inward current was induced in sniffer cells in response to a 100 ms depolarizing pulse to +70 mV in GAT-1 cells (−379 ± 71 pA; Figure 3A; n = 5). A train of 10 ms pulses to +70 mV at 10 Hz also induced an inward current, this time with a more gradual onset (−207 ± 48 pA; Figure 3B; n = 9). Based on the data presented above, we considered whether GAT-1 might reverse rapidly enough to release GABA during an action potential. To test this hypothesis, we simulated action potentials in CHO cells (which do not generate action potentials on their own) by varying the voltage command supplied to the amplifier using a waveform that replicated action potentials previously recorded from cultured rat neurons. In response to a train of 200 simulated action potentials at a rate of 40 Hz, an inward current was generated in sniffer cells (−76 ± 13 pA; Figure 3C; n = 12). This current was due to GABA release via GAT-1 reversal since it was blocked by SKF-89976a (40 μM; −1% ± 2% of control; n = 10; p < 0.001) and bicuculline (50 μM; 4% ± 3% of control; n = 8; p < 0.005) (Figure 3C). Although the substrate gradients used were not as close to physiological as in Figure 2A, a change in the concentration gradients for substrate would not alter the rapidity with which GAT-1 would reverse. Instead, it would only alter the reversal potential, which we have already shown is close to normal resting potential under physiological conditions. Thus, these data indicate that GAT-1 should operate rapidly enough to reverse and release GABA during action potentials in neurons. To determine whether GABA release due t"

The major activators of PKR have been proposed to be long double-stranded RNAs. We report that RNAs with very limited secondary structures activate PKR in a 5′-triphosphate–dependent fashion in vitro and in vivo. Activation of PKR by 5′-triphosphate RNA is independent of RIG-I and is enhanced by treatment with type 1 interferon (IFN-α). Surveillance of molecular features at the 5′ end of transcripts by PKR presents a means of allowing pathogenic RNA to be distinguished from self-RNA. The evidence presented here suggests that this form of RNA-based discrimination may be a critical step in mounting an early immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2155200140,"Synaptic potentials originating at distal dendritic locations are severely attenuated when they reach the soma and, thus, are poor at driving somatic spikes. Nonetheless, distal inputs convey essential information, suggesting that such inputs may be important for compartmentalized dendritic signaling. Here we report a new plasticity rule in which stimulation of distal perforant path inputs to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons induces long-term potentiation at the CA1 proximal Schaffer collateral synapses when the two inputs are paired at a precise interval. This subthreshold form of heterosynaptic plasticity occurs in the absence of somatic spiking but requires activation of both NMDA receptors and IP(3) receptor-dependent release of Ca(2+) from internal stores. Our results suggest that direct sensory information arriving at distal CA1 synapses through the perforant path provide compartmentalized, instructive signals that assess the saliency of mnemonic information propagated through the hippocampal circuit to proximal synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2064224876,"A persistent puzzle in the field of biological electron transfer is the conserved iron-sulfur cluster motif in both high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) and ferredoxin (Fd) active sites. Despite this structural similarity, HiPIPs react oxidatively at physiological potentials, whereas Fds are reduced. Sulfur K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy uncovers the substantial influence of hydration on this variation in reactivity. Fe-S covalency is much lower in natively hydrated Fd active sites than in HiPIPs but increases upon water removal; similarly, HiPIP covalency decreases when unfolding exposes an otherwise hydrophobically shielded active site to water. Studies on model compounds and accompanying density functional theory calculations support a correlation of Fe-S covalency with ease of oxidation and therefore suggest that hydration accounts for most of the difference between Fd and HiPIP reduction potentials."

PAR synthesis is initiated on glutamate residues of target proteins, and subsequent polymerization of ADP-ribose units extends from the site of initiation. As a post-translational modification, PAR substantially changes the biophysical and electrostatic properties of a protein and can alter the DNA binding functions, the protein interaction properties, and the cellular location of target proteins (2Schreiber V.

Although PARP-1 modifies several nuclear proteins, the major in vivo target is PARP-1 itself (automodification activity) (1D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem.

For example, PARP-1 has a structural role in promoting the compaction of chromatin to repress transcription (9Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Automodification of PARP-1 releases the enzyme from chromatin, allowing transcriptional machinery to access DNA and thereby controlling gene expression (9Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). PARP-1 also plays a role in DNA damage repair. DNA strand breaks stimulate PARP-1 automodification, and activated PARP-1 recruits DNA repair factors to the site of DNA damage to facilitate repair (10Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 11El-Khamisy S.F. Masutani M. Suzuki H. Caldecott K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5526-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). There are several factors that control PARP-1 activity, including self-association, interaction with histones and nucleosomes, NAD+ concentrations, structure-specific binding to DNA, and automodification (1D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Hakam A. Kun E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, there are few molecular level insights into mechanisms that control PARP-1 activity. PARP-1 is 113 kDa (in human) and has a modular architecture composed of multiple, independently folded domains (Fig. 1A). The PARP-1 polypeptide is generally described in three major segments that represent the biochemical activities and functional roles of the enzyme: the DNA-binding domain (DBD; residues 1–374), the automodification domain (residues 375–525), and the catalytic domain (residues 526–1014). The catalytic domain of PARP-1 is located at the C-terminal end of the protein. It is highly conserved in the PARP superfamily, particularly in a region called the PARP signature that is responsible for binding NAD+ (8Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 13Ruf A. Mennissier de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Schulz G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7481-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The automodification domain has a BRCT fold (BRCA1 C terminus). This fold is present in several DNA repair factors and is frequently found to mediate protein-protein interactions (14Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Indeed, the BRCT domain of PARP-1 is responsible for the protein-protein interaction that recruits DNA repair enzymes during strand break repair (10Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 11El-Khamisy S.F. Masutani M. Suzuki H. Caldecott K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5526-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain is located at the N terminus of PARP-1. The DBD contains two zinc fingers that bind to various DNA structures (15Rolli V. Ruf A. Augustin A. Schulz G.E. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. de Murcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signalling to Cell Death: Poly ADP-ribosylation Reactions. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 35-79Google Scholar), a nuclear localization signal (16Schreiber V. Molinete M. Boeuf H. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a caspase-3 cleavage site (17Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). NMR and x-ray models have structurally defined each of the independent domains of PARP-1 (Fig. 1A), except for the C-terminal region of the DBD, between the first two zinc fingers and the BRCT domain (Fig. 1B). We therefore undertook a structural analysis of this region to understand its role in PARP-1 function and to build upon our understanding of the multidomain structure of PARP-1 and how these domains assemble into an active DNA-dependent enzyme. The two N-terminal zinc fingers of PARP-1 bind to DNA structures to trigger activation of the C-terminal catalytic domain of PARP-1 (18Gradwohl G. Menissier de Murcia J.M. Molinete M. Simonin F.

The molecular mechanism for coupling the DNA binding and catalytic functions of PARP-1 remains an open question. Based on our structural and biochemical analysis, we show that the DBD of human PARP-1 contains yet a third zinc-binding domain. One function of the new zinc-binding domain is to couple the DNA binding and catalytic activities of PARP-1. Gene Cloning and Mutagenesis–The gene coding for full-length human PARP-1 (residues 1–1014) and for PARP-1 residues 1–234 were placed in the pET28 expression vector (Novagen) using restriction sites NdeI/XhoI such that full-length PARP-1 (PARP-1wt) and PARP-11–234 were each produced with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and associated linker. The portions of the PARP-1 gene coding for residues 216–366, residues 1–366, and residues 379–1014 were placed in the pET24 expression vector (Novagen) using restriction sites NdeI/XhoI such that the protein fragments PARP-1216–366, PARP-11–366, and PARP-1379–1014 were each produced with a C-terminal hexahistine tag and associated linker. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Protocol (Stratagene). Protein Expression and Purification–PARP-1wt, PARP-1216–366, and PARP-11–366 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)RIPL (Stratagene). PARP-1C298A, PARP-11–234, and PARP-1379–1014 were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)Rosetta2 (Novagen). The cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μm ZnCl2 and induced with 200 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C for 20 h. The cells were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (and protease inhibitors) and lysed using a cell disrupter (Avestin). Cell debris were pelleted for 2 h at 40,000 × g, and the supernatant was then loaded onto a 5-ml HP chelating column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni(II) and pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. The column was washed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted with 400 mm imidazole. The proteins were then loaded onto a 5-ml HP heparin column (GE Healthcare), except for PARP-1379–1014 (see below). For full-length PARP-1 constructs and the PARP-11–366 and PARP-11–234 fragments, the heparin column was equilibrated at 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm TCEP, and 1 mm EDTA and eluted with a gradient from 150 mm to 1 m NaCl. For PARP-1216–366, the heparin column was equilibrated with only 50 mm NaCl, and the elution gradient was 50 mm to 500 mm NaCl. PARP-1379–1014 was loaded onto a 5-ml HP Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm TCEP, and 1 mm EDTA and eluted with a gradient from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl. The proteins were next passed over a Sephacryl S200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm TCEP, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Full-length PARP-1wt did not require the gel filtration purification step. Proteolytic degradation removed a small portion of the N terminus of PARP-11–366 and the C terminus of PARP-11–234 during protein purification. The degradation is noticed as a doublet of bands on SDS-PAGE. For Co(II)-substituted PARP-1216–366 (Co(II)-PARP-1216–366), E. coli were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 30 μm CoCl2. For selenomethionine (SeMet)-containing PARP-1216–366, BL21(DE3)RIPL E. coli were grown in defined medium (20Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The purification protocol for Co(II)- and SeMet-PARP-1216–366 was as described for native PARP-1216–366. Atomic Absorption and Amino Acid Composition Analysis–Atomic absorption analysis of zinc content was performed at Galbraith Laboratories, Inc. (Knoxville, TN). Amino acid composition analysis was performed at the Molecular Biology Core Facilities of The Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). Absorbance Spectra of PARP-1216–366 and Co(II)-PARP-1216–366–Native PARP-1216–366 and Co(II)-PARP-1216–366 were diluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl to a final concentration of 35 μm. Absorbance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer in the wavelength ranges of 800–500 and 500–250 nm. For metal competition experiments, 125 μm ZnCl2 or MgCl2 was added to 20 μm of Co(II)-PARP-1216–366. The mixture was incubated for 15 min and then rescanned from 500 to 250 nm. CD Spectroscopy–A JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter was used to record CD spectra. Wavelength scans (280–200 nm) were performed at 4 °C in a quartz cuvette of 1-mm path length. The protein was at 5 μm in a buffer composed of 5 mm Na,KPO4, pH 7.5, 50 mm Na2SO4, and 0.1 mm TCEP. The final spectra represent the averages of three scans. The data were analyzed using the JFIT program (Dr. B. Rupp). Fluorescence Polarization DNA Binding Assay–A 42-base pair duplex DNA was assembled to contain the chicken cTnT promoter sequence from -102 to -59, including an MCAT-1 element (21Huang K. Tidyman W.E. Le K.U. Kirsten E. Kun E. Ordahl C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The MCAT DNA probe carried a 5′ FAM on the bottom strand. The binding reactions were performed in 12 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 5.5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol. The reactions contained 5 nm DNA probe and various concentrations of protein. The reactions were incubated at room temperature (22 °C) for 30 min and then at 4 °C for 90 min. Fluorescence polarization data were collected on a Polarstar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtech). The observed binding constant (KD) was obtained by fitting the data to a two-state binding model. DNA-dependent Automodification Assay–The automodification reactions were performed at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm TCEP. PARP-1wt or PARP-1C298A (0.62 μm) was first preincubated with 1 μm nonfluorescent MCAT DNA (same sequence as referenced above (21Huang K. Tidyman W.E. Le K.U. Kirsten E. Kun E. Ordahl C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) for 20 min. 5 mm NAD+ was then added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for various times. Under these conditions, automodification results in a visible shift in the electrophoretic mobility of PARP-1 on SDS-PAGE (22Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the complementation assay, PARP-1379–1014 (0.93 μm) was incubated with a 1:1 molar ratio (0.93 μm) or 2:1 molar ratio (1.85 μm) of PARP-11–366, or PARP-11–234. The reactions were incubated for 10 min, after the addition of DNA and NAD+ as specified above. In each of the experiments described above, the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-loading buffer containing 0.1 m EDTA. The samples were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was treated with Imperial protein stain (Pierce). Crystallization and Structure Determination of PARP-1216–366–Native and SeMet crystals of PARP-1216–366 were grown in sitting drops at 4 °C. The protein at 30–60 mg/ml was mixed with an equal volume of 20% ethanol and 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen, the crystals were briefly (<1 min) transferred to 15% propanediol, 25% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP. X-ray diffraction data were collected at Beamline X-12C at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). X-ray data were collected at two wavelengths for both native and SeMet-PARP-1216–366 crystals, and the data were processed using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) (Table 1). Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) experimental phases were calculated in SOLVE/RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) using the data collected at the zinc and at the selenium absorption edge for SeMet-PARP-1216–366 crystals. The model was primarily built into experimental electron density maps calculated with phases from the zinc SAD experiment (supplemental Fig. S1). The SeMet SAD data were mostly used to locate methionine residues to confirm the register of the amino acid sequence. Even so, electron density maps calculated with SeMet SAD phases were of good quality and helped confirm difficult areas of the map. The model was constructed using the molecular graphics program COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The final model includes residues 225–359, one zinc atom, 160 water molecules, one ethanol molecule, and three glycerol molecules. N-terminal residues 216–224 and C-terminal residues 360–366 were poorly represented in electron density maps and therefore were excluded from the model. The side chain atoms of residues 225–228, 233, and 337 were not clearly represented in electron density maps; therefore the side chains of these residues were truncated after the β-carbon.

Several PARP-1 fragments were produced that sampled potential domain boundaries at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of this region. Limited proteolysis of the PARP-1 fragments and mass spectrometry of the proteolytic products were used to determine the minimal boundaries of a domain that was resistant to further proteolysis (data not shown). A PARP-1 fragment resulting from this analysis included residues 216–366 of PARP-1 with a C-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag, PARP-1216–366. CD analysis of PARP-1216–366 showed that this fragment of PARP-1 had secondary structure elements (peaks at 220 and 210 nm) (Fig. 2A, Native curve) (29Gratzer W.B. Cowburn D.A. Nature. 1969; 222: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that underwent similar cooperative transitions during thermal melts (data not shown), consistent with the denaturation of a folded protein domain. The CD spectrum was analyzed using JFIT, which predicted that the domain is composed of α-helices and coils (52.1 and 47.9%, respectively; R factor: 16.5%). The N terminus of PARP-1216–366 was sensitive to trypsin digestion because of a patch of Lys residues between residues 221 and 226; therefore the true boundary of this domain of PARP-1 is likely to be after this Lys-rich region. However, other fragments that sampled the N-terminal boundary gave the same CD profile. Further structural analysis focused on the PARP-1216–366 fragment of PARP-1. There are no strong amino acid sequence homologs for PARP-1216–366 that can be identified through comparison with structure databases. Through visual inspection of the multiple sequence alignment of PARP-1 homologs (Fig. 1B), we noted four strictly conserved Cys residues (Cys295, Cys298, Cys311, and Cys321, in humans) within the PARP-1216–366 domain that had spacing reminiscent of the zinc finger protein fold (30Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The spacing between the four Cys residues is strongly conserved among all organisms, following the pattern CX2CX11/12CX9C where C is cysteine and Xn is the number of amino acids between the Cys residues. We speculated that PARP-1216–366 might bind zinc as part of the structure of this domain. Atomic absorption analysis indicated that zinc co-purified with PARP-1216–366 through three chromatographic steps and extensive dialysis. Based on this analysis, there were 1.5 mol of zinc/mol of protein, whereas no zinc was detected in dialysis buffer. We therefore concluded that PARP-1216–366 binds at least one molecule of zinc. Co(II)-PARP-1216–366 was produced to gain more insight into the metal binding properties of the new zinc-binding domain. Co(II) can frequently substitute for zinc-binding sites, and the spectroscopic properties of a protein-Co(II) complex can provide structural insights into a metal-binding protein (31Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Matthews J.M. Kowalski K. Liew C.K. Sharpe B.K. Fox A.H. Crossley M. MacKay J.P. Eur J Biochem. 2000; 267: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The absorbance spectra of native PARP-1216–366 and Co(II)-PARP-1216–366 (both at 35 μm) were analyzed from 800 to 500 nm (Fig. 2B) and from 450 to 280 nm (Fig. 2C). The absorbance peak at 340 nm for Co(II)-PARP-1216–366 is consistent with a charge transfer between a thiol ligand and Co(II) (Fig. 2B). This absorbance peak is not present in native PARP-1216–366. The absorbance measurement at 340 nm estimated that there are four to six Co(II)-thiol bonds/molecule of PARP-1216–366 (A340 = 0.175; ϵ = 1300–900 m-1 cm-1 (33May S.W. Kuo J.Y. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3333-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the ligand field bands in the visible range of the absorbance spectrum (600–750 nm) (Fig. 2C) are characteristic of a tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II) (34Bertini I. Luchinat C. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 6: 71-111PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that there are four ligands to Co(II). The absorbance at 685 nm estimated that there were 1.4 Co(II)/molecule of PARP-1216–366 (A685 = 0.038; ϵ = 780 m-1 cm-1). Collectively, the spectroscopic analysis of Co(II)-PARP-1216–366 indicated that there was one Co(II) coordinated by four Cys residues. The absorbance peak at 340 nm disappears with the addition of a 6-fold excess of Zn(II) to Co(II)-PARP-1216–366 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the same concentration of Mg(II) did not change the absorbance spectrum between 450 and 300 nm (Fig. 2D, inset). This result indicated that PARP-1216–366 preferentially binds zinc and that Co(II) occupies the same metal-binding site as zinc. Importantly, the secondary structure of Co(II)-PARP-1216–366, before and after treatment with excess zinc, was observed to be the same as native PARP-1216–366 by CD analysis (Fig. 2A), indicating that Co(II)- and Zn(II)-bound PARP-1216–366 have the same overall fold. The Third Zinc-binding Domain Mediates Interdomain Contacts Important for PARP-1 Activation–Spectral analysis of the metal binding properties of PARP-1216–366 in solution strongly suggested that four Cys residues coordinated a zinc atom. The strictly conserved Cys residues (Cys295, Cys298, Cys311, and Cys321) were deemed the most likely zinc ligands. Each of these Cys residues was changed to Ala in PARP-1216–366 to test their potential roles as zinc-binding ligands and structural elements of the protein fold. However, each of these mutations made PARP-1216–366 difficult to produce in E. coli, and the extremely low yield of protein prevented further analysis of the mutants in this context. Wild-type PARP-1216–366 was abundantly produced in E. coli; therefore it is likely that the Cys to Ala mutations compromised the capacity of PARP-1216–366 to form a stable fold. The Cys to Ala point mutants were also created in full-length human PARP-1 to test the functional role of the third zinc-binding domain. Each of these single amino acid substitutions led to a drastic decrease in protein production in E. coli as compared with full-length PARP-1 (PARP-1wt), further suggesting that the conserved Cys residues are important for efficient"

A typical clinical feature associated with SARS is pulmonary fibrosis and the associated lung failure. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein potentiates transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells. The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-β is Smad3-specific. N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-β signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis. Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-β signaling molecules.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a well characterized cytokine and controls a variety of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis; development; immune homeostasis; and tissue remodeling and repairing (7Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar).

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). TGF-β plays a pivotal role in pulmonary fibrosis (8Roberts A.B. Tian F. Byfield S.D. Stuelten C. Ooshima A.

It increases the production of extracellular matrix proteins, enhances the secretion of protease inhibitors, and reduces secretion of proteases, thus leading to deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. TGF-β can also induce pulmonary fibrosis directly through stimulation of fibroblast chemotactic migration and proliferation as well as fibroblast-myofibroblast transition. The canonical TGF-β signal transduction is initiated with the ligand binding to its serine/threonine kinase receptors on the cell surface, which leads to the activation of downstream cytoplasmic effectors, the Smad proteins. The receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3 are involved in TGF-β signaling. Once phosphorylated by the type I receptor, they form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, and the Smad heterocomplexes are accumulated in the nucleus, where they regulate target gene transcription in association with DNA binding partners (10Shi Y.

In this study, we report that SARS-CoV N protein can specifically potentiate the Smad3-mediated transcriptional responses of TGF-β such as the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which plays a critical role in fibrosis. Interestingly, N protein interferes with TGF-β-induced and Smad4-mediated pro-apoptotic genes expression and cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, N protein interacts with Smad3 and impairs Smad3-Smad4 heterocomplex formation. Our findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-β signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis. These results may also have implication in understanding of other virus-induced tissue fibrosis.

Cell Culture and Establishment of Stable Cell LinesHEK293T, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). HPL1 cells were maintained as described (20Masuda A. Kondo M. Saito T. Yatabe Y. Kobayashi T. Okamoto M. Suyama M. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4898-4904PubMed Google Scholar). To generate stable cells expressing N protein, HPL1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-N or empty vector using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants were selected with 0.6 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 14 days. Individual clones were then obtained after confirmation of N protein expression by immunoblotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation AssayChIP assay was performed as previously described (21Zhang S.

The primers used in ChIP assay to amplify the human PAI-1 promoter (nucleotide -733 to -484) are 5′-AGCCAGACAAGGTTGTTG-3′ and 5′-GACCACCTCCAGGAAAG-3′. Luciferase Reporter AssayLuciferase reporter assay was performed as previously described (21Zhang S. Fei T. Zhang L. Zhang R. Chen F. Ning Y. Han Y. Feng X.H. Meng A. Chen Y.G. Mol. Cell.

Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the data represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments after normalized to Renilla activity. Immunoprecipitation and GST Pulldown AssayHEK293T cells were transfected with the indicted plasmids using the phosphate calcium method. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA at pH 8.0, 25 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. Total cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 12000 × g for 10 min. For co-immunoprecipitation, specific antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added into cell lysates. For GST pulldown, Sepharose 4B-glutathione (Amersham Biosciences) beads were added. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, beads were washed four times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). The bound proteins were then examined by immunoblotting. RNA Preparation, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and Quantitative Real-time PCRRNA preparation and reverse transcription-PCR have been performed as previously described (21Zhang S. Fei T. Zhang L. Zhang R. Chen F. Ning Y. Han Y. Feng X.H. Meng A. Chen Y.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4488-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-β1. PCR and real-time PCR were performed with the following primer sets: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5′-CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTGT-3′), β-actin (5′-CGAGGACTTTGATTGCAC-3′ and 5′-TATCACCTCCCCTGTGTG-3′), PAI-1 (5′-GAGACAGGCAGCTCGGATTC-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCCCAAAGTGCATTAC-3′), α2 chain of type I collagen (COL1A2) (5′-GTGTAAGCGGTGGTGGGT-3′ and 5′-GCCCGGATACAGGTTT-3′), Bim (5′-GCCTTCAACCACTATCTCA-3′ and 5′-ATCCAGCTCGGTGTCTTCT-3′), and Bax (5′-ATGGACGGGTCCGGGGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CATGATGGTTCTGATCAGTT-3′). Real-time PCR was performed using Mx3000P™ (Stratagene). The amplified DNAs were quantitated by the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method for relative quantitation of gene expression, normalized to GAPDH. Post-PCR melting curves confirmed the specificity of single specific target amplification. Fluorescence-activated Cell SortingHPL1 cells were co-transfected with GFP and other constructs as indicated. One day after transfection, cells were treated with 200 pm TGF-β1 for 48 h. Then cells were harvested and fixed with 75% alcohol at -20 °C overnight. Before loaded to flow cytometry analysis, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml RNase and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide at 4 °C for 30 min. The GFP-positive cells were selected by FACScan flow cytometer (BD Sciences) for cell cycle analysis. Experiments were performed in triplicate. ImmunohistochemistryThe experiment was performed as previously described (15Nicholls J.M. Butany J. Poon L.L. Chan K.H. Beh S.L. Poutanen S. Peiris J.S. Wong M.

Color was developed by using the 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole or diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate kit (Sigma) as indicated in the figures. Collagen was stained using the Masson trichrome method, and slide examinations were performed with a Nikon Eclipse E-800 fluorescence microscope.

SARS-CoV N Protein Specifically Enhances TGF-β/Smad3-induced Transcriptional ActivationAs one of major clinical characteristics that resulted from SARS-CoV infection is lung fibrosis and TGF-β has been well documented to play a critical role in tissue fibrosis, we attempted to explore whether TGF-β signaling is involved in SARS-CoV-induced lung fibrosis. Among the confirmed SARS-CoV-encoded proteins, N protein is a structural cytosolic protein involved in viral nucleocapsid assembly and regulation of host cell processes. To explore if N protein affects TGF-β signaling, transcriptional responses of TGF-β in the presence of N protein were examined with TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporters in human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells, which retain characteristics of type II pneumocytes and respond to TGF-β1 (20Masuda A. Kondo M. Saito T. Yatabe Y. Kobayashi T. Okamoto M. Suyama M. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4898-4904PubMed Google Scholar). HPL1 cells were co-transfected with N protein and CAGA-luciferase, which contains the Smad-binding element tetranucleotide (CAGA) sequence and can be specifically activated by Smad3 and Smad4 (22Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, N protein enhanced the TGF-β-induced reporter expression, and this enhancement was in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were also obtained in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (data not shown). N protein also enhanced the expression of 3TP-luciferase, a TGF-β-responsive reporter (23Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, N protein further enhanced Smad3-promoted expression of CAGA-luciferase (Fig. 1C). ARE-luciferase, which contains activin-response element from Xenopus Mix.2 promoter, is known to be activated by both TGF-β and activin via Smad2, Smad4, and forkhead DNA-binding protein FoxH (24Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Interestingly, N protein had no effect on the expression of ARE-luciferase induced by TGF-β (Fig. 1D). BRE-luciferase-containing BMP response element, which was derived from the Xenopus Vent2 promoter, can be specifically activated by Smad1 (25Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Again, N protein had no effect on the expression of BRE-luciferase induced by constitutively active form type I receptor of BMP, BMPRIB(QD) (Fig. 1E). These data implied that N protein specifically promotes Smad3-mediated TGF-β signaling. To further confirm that N protein has specific effect on the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, we examined the effect of N protein on CAGA-luciferase expression in Smad3-/- MEFs. As shown in Fig. 1F, N protein up-regulated the TGF-β-induced expression of CAGA-luciferase in normal MEFs in a dose-dependent manner, whereas neither TGF-β nor N protein activated CAGA-luciferase expression in Smad3-/- MEFs. Taken together, these results suggested that N protein elevates TGF-β signaling via Smad3 but not Smad2. N Protein Enhances TGF-β-induced Expression of PAI-1Histopathological studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection causes lung pathological changes in SARS patients such as infiltration of macrophages in the alveolar spaces (13Ding Y. Wang H. Shen H. Li Z. Geng J. Han H. Cai J. Li X. Kang W. Weng D. Lu Y. Wu D. He L. Yao K. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 14Nicholls J.M. Poon L.L. Lee K.C.

Lancet. 2003; 361: 1773-1778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TGF-β1 in pneumocytes (16He L. Ding Y. Zhang Q. Che X. He Y. Shen H. Wang H. Li Z. Zhao L. Geng J. Deng Y. Yang L. Li J. Cai J. Qiu L. Wen K. Xu X. Jiang S. J. Pathol. 2006; 210: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that TGF-β might have an important function in SARS-associated lung pathological changes. The TGF-β-regulated expression of extracellular matrix molecules such as PAI-1 and type I collagen play important roles in lung fibrosis (8Roberts A.B. Tian F. Byfield S.D. Stuelten C. Ooshima A. Saika S. Flanders K.C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Kaminski N. Allard J.D. Pittet J.F. Zuo F. Griffiths M.J. Morris D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that SARS-infected lungs expressed a high level of collagen (Fig. 2A, top right panel). Accordingly, PAI-1 expression in the vicinity of pneumocytes was apparently higher in the lung tissue of SARS patients than in the normal lung (Fig. 2A, bottom panels). To directly test whether N protein has any effect on the TGF-β-induced expression of PAI-1, we established a stable HPL1 cell line expressing N protein (HPL1-N) (Fig. 2B). Reverse transcription-PCR showed that TGF-β stimulated PAI-1 expression in control cells HPL1-V and N protein enhanced the basal and TGF-β-stimulated expression of PAI-1 (Fig. 2C). This result was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 2D). Transient expression of N protein in human normal lung fibroblast 2BS cells also enhanced the TGF-β-induced expression of PAI-1 and α2 chain of type I collagen (COL1A2) (Fig. 2, E and F). To further study the effect of N protein on TGF-β-induced PAI-1 expression, we utilized the reporter p800-luciferase that contains a fragment of the PAI-1 promoter harboring Smad-binding element and responds to TGF-β (27Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both N protein and Smad3 enhanced the basal and TGF-β-stimulated expression of this reporter (Fig. 2G), and the small molecule SB431542, a specific inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor, greatly attenuated the effect of N protein on the p800-luciferase expression. Furthermore, there was a synergistic effect between N protein and Smad3. We also investigated whether knockdown of endogenous Smad3 or Smad4 has any effect on the N protein-enhanced reporter expression. As shown in Fig. 2H, both anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4 siRNA worked efficiently. Knockdown of endogenous Smad3 expression by siRNA blocked N protein-enhanced reporter expression (Fig. 2I). However, knockdown of endogenous Smad4 expression had no effect on TGF-β-induced p800-luciferase expression, but rather promoted N protein enhancement of TGF-β activity. These results together indicated that N protein enhances TGF-β-induced expression of PAI-1 and type I collagen, and the enhancement of N protein is Smad3-dependent but Smad4-independent. To consolidate this, we carried out a p800-luciferase reporter assay in Smad4-/- human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468. As shown in Fig. 2J, N protein also enhanced the TGF-β-induced p800-luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner. N Protein Interacts with Smad3The above results demonstrated that N protein enhances the TGF-β transcriptional response and collaborates with Smad3 to stimulate PAI-1 expression. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we then tested whether N protein interacts with the components of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged N protein was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with various FLAG-Smad constructs. GST pulldown and anti-FLAG immunoblotting showed that N protein only interacted with Smad3 but not other Smad proteins tested (Fig. 3A). N protein also interacted with endogenous Smad3 (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether Smad3 phosphorylation has any effect on Smad3-N protein interaction, we utilized two Smad3 mutants, Smad3(SD), a constitutively active form with replacement of Asp at Ser-422 and Ser-424, and Smad3(SA), phosphorylation-defective form with replacement of Ala at Ser-421, Ser-422, and Ser-424. GST pulldown and anti-FLAG immunoblotting showed that N protein exhibited a similar binding affinity to wild-type Smad3 and Smad3(SD) mutant but had a lower binding affinity to Smad3(SA) (Fig. 3C). To define the interaction domains of Smad3 with N protein, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay with Smad3 truncation mutants in HEK293T cells and found that N protein interacted with the MH2 domain of Smad3 (Fig. 3D). The N-terminal domain of N protein binds viral genomic RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex, whereas the C-terminal domain is responsible for self-assembly to form a homodimer (28Tan Y.W. Fang S. Fan H. Lescar J. Liu D.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4816-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Surjit M. Liu B. Kumar P. Chow V.T. Lal S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Several nuclear localization signals have been identified in both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of N protein, whereas only one putative nuclear export signal is located in the middle (amino acids 220–231) (30Rowland R.R. Chauhan V. Fang Y. Pekosz A. Kerrigan M. Burton M.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11507-11512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Timani K.A. Liao Q. Ye L. Zeng Y. Liu J. Zheng Y. Yang X. Lingbao K. Gao J. Zhu Y. Virus Res. 2005; 114: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We further mapped the region of N protein interacting with Smad3. GST pulldown assay showed that GST-Smad3 but not GST associated with both of the N- and C-terminal domains of N protein (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, only the C-terminal regions (both N (aa 211–422) and N (aa 232–422)) could up-regulate TGF-β-induced CAGA-luciferase expression while N (aa 2–210) had no effect (Fig. 3F), indicating that the promoting effect of N protein on TGF-β signaling is mediated by its C-terminal domain. N Protein Interferes with Smad3-Smad4 Complex FormationNext, we examined whether N protein influences Smad3-Smad4 complex formation. HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-Smad3 and FLAG-Smad4 with or without N protein. The constitutively active TβRI (ca-TβRI) was co-transfected to mimic TGF-β stimulation. When overexpressed, Smad3 interacted with Smad4 independent of ca-TβRI stimulation, but ca-TβRI further enhanced the Smad3-Smad4 interaction (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, N protein interfered with the interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 in a dose-depend"
https://openalex.org/W2081612341,"The PsbS subunit of photosystem II (PSII) plays a key role in nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), the major photoprotective regulatory mechanism in higher plant thylakoid membranes, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Here we describe direct evidence that PsbS controls the organization of PSII and its light harvesting system (LHCII). The changes in chlorophyll fluorescence amplitude associated with the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent restacking of thylakoid membranes were measured in thylakoids prepared from wild-type plants, a PsbS-deficient mutant and a PsbS overexpresser. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> requirement and sigmoidicity of the titration curves for the fluorescence rise were negatively correlated with the level of PsbS. Using a range of PsbS mutants, this effect of PsbS was shown not to depend upon its efficacy in controlling NPQ, but to be related only to protein concentration. Electron microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy showed that this effect was because of enhancement of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent re-association of PSII and LHCII by PsbS, rather than an effect on stacking <i>per se</i>. In the presence of PsbS the LHCII·PSII complex was also more readily removed from thylakoid membranes by detergent, and the level of PsbS protein correlated with the amplitude of the <i>psi</i>-type CD signal originating from features of LHCII·PSII organization. It is proposed that PsbS regulates the interaction between LHCII and PSII in the grana membranes, explaining how it acts as a pH-dependent trigger of the conformational changes within the PSII light harvesting system that result in NPQ."

This primary olfactory circuit is hard-wired through the action of genetic cues. We asked whether individual glomeruli have the capacity for stimulus-evoked plasticity by focusing on the carbon dioxide (CO2) circuit in Drosophila. Specialized OSNs detect this gas and relay the information to a dedicated circuit in the brain. Prolonged exposure to CO2 induced a reversible volume increase in the CO2-specific glomerulus. OSNs showed neither altered morphology nor function after chronic exposure, but one class of inhibitory local interneurons showed significantly increased responses to CO2. Two-photon imaging of the axon terminals of a single PN innervating the CO2 glomerulus showed significantly decreased functional output following CO2 exposure. Behavioral responses to CO2 were also reduced after such exposure. We suggest that activity-dependent functional plasticity may be a general feature of the Drosophila olfactory system.

Once formed, the map—and the anatomical and functional properties of the neurons that compose the map—appears to be stable.

Biol. 2004; 14: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The adult olfactory circuit thus respects the glomerular boundaries imposed during development. Despite the stability of the overall map, the olfactory circuit appears to have the capacity for experience-dependent plasticity within the confines of a given glomerulus. In Drosophila, deprivation of input from one antenna reveals the existence of activity-dependent competition between the axons of ipsi- and contralateral OSNs in a glomerulus (Berdnik et al., 2006Berdnik D.

In honeybee workers, the volume of a few identified glomeruli correlates with and is modulated by foraging experience outside the confines of the hive (Winnington et al., 1996Winnington A.P.

Previous studies in Drosophila showed that exposing flies to a single odor for several days causes stimulus-dependent decreases in glomerulus volume (Devaud et al., 2001Devaud J.M. Acebes A.

These earlier experiments by Devaud et al. were carried out before the odor tuning (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R.

We were interested in revisiting the question of glomerular plasticity in the Drosophila olfactory system but using odor ligands specific for identified circuit elements. To examine the neurophysiological and behavioral consequences accompanying stimulus-dependent anatomical plasticity within olfactory glomeruli, we focused on the dedicated circuit for CO2 detection. CO2 is a major component of Drosophila stress odor, which mediates potent avoidance behavior (Suh et al., 2004Suh G.S. Wong A.M. Hergarden A.C. Wang J.W. Simon A.F. Benzer S. Axel R. Anderson D.J. A single population of olfactory sensory neurons mediates an innate avoidance behaviour in Drosophila.Nature. 2004; 431: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In another context, CO2 reduces attraction to food sources in female Drosophila (Faucher et al., 2006Faucher C. Forstreuter M. Hilker M. de Bruyne M. Behavioral responses of Drosophila to biogenic levels of carbon dioxide depend on life-stage, sex and olfactory context.J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 2739-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, CO2 is detected by a population of approximately 25–30 OSNs in the antenna that express the chemosensory receptor Gr21a (de Bruyne et al., 2001de Bruyne M. Foster K. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2001; 30: 537-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, Suh et al., 2004Suh G.S. Wong A.M. Hergarden A.C. Wang J.W.

Weiss L.A. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of CO2 reception in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These OSNs project axons that terminate in the V glomerulus in the ventral antennal lobe (Scott et al., 2001Scott K. Brady Jr., R. Cravchik A. Morozov P. Rzhetsky A. Zuker C. Axel R. A chemosensory gene family encoding candidate gustatory and olfactory receptors in Drosophila.Cell. 2001; 104: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The Drosophila CO2 circuit is ideal for studying odor-evoked plasticity because Gr21a-expressing OSNs are the only neurons in the fly that respond to CO2 (Suh et al., 2004Suh G.S. Wong A.M. Hergarden A.C. Wang J.W. Simon A.F. Benzer S. Axel R. Anderson D.J. A single population of olfactory sensory neurons mediates an innate avoidance behaviour in Drosophila.Nature. 2004; 431: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and they do not respond to any other stimuli (de Bruyne et al., 2001de Bruyne M. Foster K. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2001; 30: 537-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined stimulus-evoked changes in the anatomy and function of the Drosophila CO2 circuit. The results provide functional evidence that a primary olfactory center is capable of activity-dependent plasticity. We exposed newly emerged flies to elevated CO2 levels and examined the antennal lobe for evidence of morphological plasticity. A given antennal lobe glomerulus is composed of processes from three different neuronal cell types: OSN axons, processes of inhibitory and excitatory local interneurons (LNs), and dendrites of projection neurons (PNs), which relay olfactory information to higher brain centers (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We wished to examine volume changes in the V glomerulus by selective visualization of OSNs and PNs with cell type-specific genetic markers. We therefore labeled OSNs that project to the V glomerulus with the Gr21a-Gal4 line. To visualize PNs that project dendrites into the V glomerulus, we used the Gal4-PN(V) enhancer trap line, which labels a single PN that selectively innervates the V glomerulus (N.K.T. and K.I., unpublished data). Flies carrying these cell type-specific Gal4 transgenes along with a UAS-GFP marker transgene were collected on the first day after adult eclosion and incubated either in ambient CO2 (air; 0.04%) or elevated CO2 (5%) for four days. Animals were sacrificed on the fifth day and their brains were processed for immunostaining and volumetric analysis of defined antennal lobe glomeruli, using the boundaries of GFP staining as a marker (Figure 1A). CO2 exposure produced a mean 38% increase in the volume of the V glomerulus, both when measured with the fluorescent GFP tracer expressed in the axon termini of 25–30 OSNs (Figure 1B) or in the dendrites of one V glomerulus PN (Figure 1C). This increase was seen in both male and female flies. CO2 exposure had no effect on glomeruli that do not receive input from CO2-sensitive OSNs. We measured the DA4 glomerulus, which receives input from Or43a-expressing OSNs tuned to cyclohexanol (Stortkuhl and Kettler, 2001Stortkuhl K.F. Kettler R. Functional analysis of an olfactory receptor in Drosophila melanogaster.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 9381-9385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and other alcohols (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), and found no effect of CO2 exposure on the DA4 glomerulus volume in male or female flies (Figure 1D). Similarly, the volume of the DM2 glomerulus, which receives input from Or22a-expressing OSNs that respond to esters and alcohols (Hallem and Carlson, 2006Hallem E.A. Carlson J.R. Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, Pelz et al., 2006Pelz D. Roeske T. Syed Z. de Bruyne M. Galizia C.G. The molecular receptive range of an olfactory receptor in vivo (Drosophila melanogaster Or22a).J. Neurobiol. 2006; 66: 1544-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was unchanged after CO2 exposure (Figure 1E). Because the absolute volume of the V glomerulus fluctuated across populations of flies reared in different vials at different times, our experiments were carefully controlled (see Experimental Procedures). This fluctuation precludes the comparison of absolute V glomerulus volumes across different experiments. Despite this variability, CO2-induced V glomerulus volume increases were highly significant even when all measurements from all manipulations in Figures 1B and 1C and Figure 2B were pooled and analyzed (p < 0.001; see Figure S1 available online), demonstrating that activity-dependent volume increases were considerably larger than sample-to-sample variability. The volume effect was apparent in both sexes. We therefore carried out further glomerular volume experiments in male flies only. We investigated the time course, reversibility, and sensitive period for volume increases induced by CO2 in the V glomerulus. Flies were exposed either to 5% CO2 or air for variable periods of time and analyzed at various time points (schematized in Figure 2A). We found that the volume increase required at least two days of exposure, as a single day of exposure showed no effect, and that volume was not further increased by a more prolonged 6 day exposure (Figure 2B). The effect was fully reversible, with V glomerulus volume restored to control levels 5 days after return to ambient conditions (Figure 2C, left). The time course of reversibility appeared to match that of the volume increase, because glomerular volumes returned to control levels as early as two days after return to ambient air (data not shown). The V glomerulus in flies 11 days posteclosion did not show exposure-induced plasticity in volume (Figure 2C, right). The volume increase of the V glomerulus was elicited specifically by CO2 exposure. When flies were exposed to a control odor, ethyl butyrate, the volume of the V glomerulus was unchanged (Figure 2D). As expected, the same ethyl butyrate exposure produced a specific volume increase in the ethyl butyrate-sensitive DM2 glomerulus (Figure 2D). Therefore, stimulus-evoked plasticity of glomerular volume appears to be a general feature of the Drosophila olfactory system, as previously reported (Devaud et al., 2001Devaud J.M. Acebes A. Ferrus A. Odor exposure causes central adaptation and morphological changes in selected olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6274-6282PubMed Google Scholar, Devaud et al., 2003Devaud J.M. Acebes A. Ramaswami M. Ferrus A. Structural and functional changes in the olfactory pathway of adult Drosophila take place at a critical age.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanisms by which CO2 modulates the volume of the V glomerulus, we asked whether odor-evoked activity in OSNs was sufficient to produce these neuroanatomical changes. This was achieved by ectopic expression and activation of an odorant receptor tuned to cyclohexanol in Gr21a neurons. Flies that express both Or43a and Or83b in Gr21a OSNs (Or43a/Or83b→Gr21a) were constructed as previously described (Benton et al., 2006Benton R. Sachse S. Michnick S.W. Vosshall L.B. Atypical membrane topology and heteromeric function of Drosophila odorant receptors in vivo.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e20https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040020Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar; Figure 2E, top). In control experiments we monitored activation of the V glomerulus with the genetically encoded calcium sensor, G-CaMP (Nakai et al., 2001Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. A high signal-to-noise Ca2+ probe composed of a single green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), in control and Or43a/Or83b→Gr21a flies (Figure 2E, bottom). We verified that cyclohexanol did not activate the V glomerulus in control flies (Figure 2E, bottom left) but that robust calcium release was evoked in the V glomerulus of Or43a/Or83b→Gr21a animals (Figure 2E, bottom right). Both control and Or43a/Or83b→Gr21a flies were then exposed to cyclohexanol for 4 days, using the same protocol as for CO2 exposure (Figure 1A). V glomerulus volume in control flies was unaffected by this manipulation (Figure 2F, left), but in Or43a/Or83b→Gr21a flies, cyclohexanol induced a significant volume increase in the V glomerulus (Figure 2F, right). We conclude that neuronal activity in the OSNs is sufficient to induce neuroanatomical modulation of the V glomerulus. This experiment also allows us to exclude the possibility that the CO2-evoked volume increases are merely a trivial effect of hypoxia rather than stimulus-evoked neuronal activity. We next asked whether CO2 exposure evokes an increase in V glomerulus volume by increasing the number of Gr21a-expressing neurons or the morphology of axonal arborization. The number of Gr21a-GFP labeled neurons in antennae from air and CO2-exposed flies was quantified (Figure S2A) and no significant differences were found (Figure S2B). The terminal axonal arbors of single Gr21a-expressing neurons obtained by the FLP-out technique (Wong et al., 2002Wong A.M. Wang J.W. Axel R. Spatial representation of the glomerular map in the Drosophila protocerebrum.Cell. 2002; 109: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar; Figures S2C and S2D) were reconstructed in three dimensions (Figure S2D) and the number of branches, total length, surface, and volume were quantified (Figure S2E). No significant differences were found in any of these parameters. Therefore, the volume increase found for the V glomerulus cannot be explained by morphological change in the OSNs. Although sensory exposure produced no morphological change in OSNs, we wondered if the physiology of these neurons is altered by prolonged exposure to CO2. Functional imaging of the terminals of Gr21a neurons in the V glomerulus with G-CaMP was used to measure CO2-evoked responses in air- and CO2-exposed flies (Figure 3A). Representative images show basal G-CaMP fluorescence in the V glomerulus (Figure 3B, top left). CO2-free air produced no increase in fluorescence over background, but even ambient air containing 0.04% CO2 induced an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration (Figure 3B). Higher CO2 concentrations evoked larger responses, with an apparent saturation in the response at 5%–10% CO2 (Figure 3B). The temporal profile of these responses is shown in Figure 3C. CO2-evoked calcium increases in the V glomerulus in CO2-exposed flies were indistinguishable from air-exposed flies at all concentrations tested (Figure 3D). We conclude that the physiology of these neurons is not changed by sensory exposure at the level of resolution obtainable by calcium imaging. We reasoned that chronic stimulation of Gr21a neurons may produce functional effects in other neurons in the antennal lobe circuit. A network of GABAergic inhibitory LNs is thought to modulate odor-evoked activity in the Drosophila antennal lobe (Ng et al., 2002Ng M. Roorda R.D. Lima S.Q. Zemelman B.V. Morcillo P. Miesenbock G.

Transformation of olfactory representations in the Drosophila antennal lobe.Science. 2004; 303: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). It seemed plausible that such neurons would exhibit anatomical or functional plasticity after CO2 exposure. To investigate this, we examined whether odor exposure modulates the number of LNs in the antennal lobe. Two different Gal4 enhancer trap lines that label nonoverlapping GABAergic populations of LNs (Gal4-LN1, Gal4-LN2; R.O. and K.I., unpublished data) were used for this analysis. Both populations of LNs are multiglomerular and target all or most antennal lobe glomeruli. Gal4-LN1 labels a median of 18 LNs (range = 15–22; R.O. and K.I., unpublished data) and Gal4-LN2 labels a median of 37 LNs (range = 28–44; R.O. and K.I., unpublished data). We did not find any significant increase in LN number with either Gal4 line upon exposure to CO2 (data not shown). We attempted to examine exposure-dependent changes of single LN clones, but even single neurons had such dense arborization within the V glomerulus that reconstructing and quantifying the branches proved to be technically impossible (data not shown). To examine whether CO2 exposure induces functional changes in either population of LNs, we used calcium imaging to measure CO2-evoked responses in LN1 or LN2 arborization in the V glomerulus (Figure 4A). Gal4-LN1-labeled LNs project evenly across all antennal lobe glomeruli, with processes targeting the core of each glomerulus (Figure 4B). To locate the position of the V glomerulus for imaging, we used a V-RFP transgenic line (constructed by fusing the Gr63a promoter to n-synaptotagmin-RFP [Gr63a-nsyt-RFP] [Jones et al., 2007Jones W.D. Cayirlioglu P. Kadow I.G. Vosshall L.B. Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in Drosophila.Nature. 2007; 445: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar]) in concert with Gal4-LN1 and UAS-G-CaMP transgenes (Figure 4C). Gr21a and Gr63a are coexpressed in the CO2-sensitive neurons that target the V glomerulus (Jones et al., 2007Jones W.D. Cayirlioglu P. Kadow I.G. Vosshall L.B. Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in Drosophila.Nature. 2007; 445: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Although CO2 evokes calcium increases in LN processes in nearly all antennal lobe glomeruli, we quantified the levels only in the V glomerulus. Such global activation of LNs by a specific odor has been shown previously (Ng et al., 2002Ng M. Roorda R.D. Lima S.Q. Zemelman B.V. Morcillo P. Miesenbock G. Transmission of olfactory information between three populations of neurons in the antennal lobe of the fly.Neuron. 2002; 36: 463-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the LN1 population responds to CO2 in a manner only weakly dependent on concentration (Figure 4D) compared to the strong dose dependence of Gr21a OSN activity (Figures 3C and 3D). There was no significant effect of CO2 exposure on the CO2-evoked (Figure 4E) or odor-evoked (Figure 4F) activity of the LN1 neurons in the V glomerulus. We next examined the functional properties of a second popul"

It is a member of the four α-helix bundle family of cytokines and was initially described as a T cell proliferation factor (1Grabstein K.H. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Rauch C. Srinivasan S. Fung V.

IL-15 shares with interleukin-2 (IL-2) a common receptor complex, consisting of the IL-2 receptors β and γ chains (3Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Both IL-2 and IL-15 use an additional private receptor subunit responsible for the specificity of binding, the IL-2 receptor α (IL-2Rα) and IL-15 receptor α (IL-15Rα), respectively. Both molecules have a similar ligand-binding motif (sushi domain) as well as a relatively short intracellular tail (13 amino acids for human IL-2Rα and 41 amino acids for human IL-15Rα). In contrast to IL-2Rα, which displays a lower affinity for IL-2 (Kd ∼ 10-8 m) and is expressed mainly on activated T cells, IL-15Rα has a high affinity for IL-15 (Kd∼10-11 m), and its mRNA has a wide tissue distribution (4Giri J.G.

IL-15-/- and IL-15Rα-/- mice have profound defects in NK, NK-T, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and memory CD8+ T cells, indicating that IL-15 is essential for the homeostatic maintenance and function of these cells (5Kennedy M.K.

In contrast, IL-2-/- and IL-2Rα-/- mice develop autoimmune diseases with increased frequency of activated T and B cells (7Sadlack B. Merz H. Schorle H. Schimpl A. Feller A.C. Horak I.

Despite the clear results on the positive role of IL-15Rα for IL-15 function, several investigators have reported inhibitory effects of IL-15Rα on IL-15 function. Injection in mice of a soluble recombinant form of IL-15Rα protein (IL-15sRα) was reported to suppress natural killer (NK) cell proliferation and T-dependent immune responses in vivo (9Ruchatz H. Leung B.P. Wei X.Q. McInnes I.B. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5654-5660PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of IL-15sRα in vitro was reported to block the response of cell lines to IL-15 (10Smith X.G. Bolton E.M. Ruchatz H. Wei X. Liew F.Y. Bradley J.A. J.

Despite these findings, more recent reports show that a soluble sushi domain of IL-15Rα or IL-15sRα linked to an Fc fragment can enhance IL-15 activity both in vitro and in vivo (12Stoklasek T.A.

IL-15 function is complex and depends on the presence of IL-15Rα. Trans-presentation of IL-15 by bone marrow-derived cells is thought to be the dominant mechanism for IL-15 action in vivo (15Dubois S. Mariner J. Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y.

It has been reported that IL-15Rα is cleaved by TACE/ADAM17 together with trans-presented IL-15 (22Budagian V. Bulanova E. Orinska Z. Ludwig A. Rose-John S. Saftig P. Borden E.C. Bulfone-Paus S. J.

It was proposed that these soluble complexes may have inhibitory or stimulatory activities (23Budagian V. Bulanova E. Paus R. Bulfone-Paus S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 259-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing generating different forms of the IL-15Rα have been reported (4Giri J.G. Kumaki S.

The low expression of IL-15 has been attributed to the complex regulation of the gene at the levels of transcription, translation, protein trafficking, and secretion (28Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N.

Pohl T. Krause H. Bulfone-Paus S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 255-262PubMed Google Scholar). We have used optimized coding sequences for the human, rhesus macaque, and murine IL-15 and IL-15Rα to express the authentic proteins alone or together in tissue culture and in mice. Vectors for the expression of IL-15 using the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence and of the secreted extracellular portion of IL-15Rα (IL-15sRα) were also produced. Our results show that the co-expression of IL-15 and IL-15Rα leads to stabilization of both molecules during production and to better secretion. The levels of secreted cytokine are thus increased, and in vivo experiments demonstrate that this leads to greatly enhanced biological function. These results explain several puzzling observations about IL-15 function and interactions and suggest methods to use the improved IL-15 cytokine expression plasmids for the optimal induction of the immune system. DNA Plasmids–The backbone vector used for the generation of all the constructs, pCMVkan, contains the human cytomegalovirus promoter, the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site, and the kanamycin resistance gene (32Rosati M. von Gegerfelt A. Roth P. Alicea C. Valentin A. Robert-Guroff M. Venzon D. Montefiori D.C. Markham P. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8480-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Schneider R.

The RNA-optimized expression vectors for the human IL-15, having its own leader sequence (LSP) or substituted with the leader sequence from tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (plasmid IL-15 tPA6, referred to as IL-15t herein), have been described elsewhere (34Jalah R. Rosati M. Kulkarni V. Patel V. Bergamaschi C. Valentin A. Zhang G.-M. Sidhu M.K. Eldridge J.H. Weiner D.B. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2007; 26: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The human IL-15Rα sequence was RNA/codon-optimized by introducing multiple silent point mutations that result in more stable mRNA. The amino acid sequence of human IL-15Rα corresponds to GenBank™ accession number NP-002180. The plasmid expressing the soluble form of human IL-15Rα (IL-15sRα, amino acids 1-205) was generated by PCR. A dual promoter plasmid expressing IL-15t from the simian CMV promoter and IL-15Rα from the human CMV promoter was also used in some experiments. For the in vivo studies, highly purified, endotoxin-free DNA plasmid preparations were produced using Qiagen EndoFree Giga kit (Hilden, Germany). In Vitro Transient Transfection and Protein Expression–Human 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique using 0.1 μg of the IL-15-expressing plasmid alone or in combination with 0.1 μg of either the IL-15Rα or the IL-15sRα expression plasmids and supernatants, and cells were harvested after 24 or 48 h. Co-transfection of 0.05 μg of the GFP expression vector pFRED143 (35Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) served as internal control. GFP variation in the different samples was less than 50%. Human IL-15 levels were measured by ELISA (Quantikine human IL-15 immunoassay; R & D Systems) or by Western immunoblot (using the polyclonal goat anti-human IL-15 antibody AF315, R & D Systems). Human IL-15Rα expression was analyzed by Western immunoblot using polyclonal goat anti-human IL-15Rα antibody AF247 (R & D Systems). Protein bands were visualized on immunoblots by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, separate plates were transfected with the FLAG-tagged IL-15 plasmid, the IL-15Rα plasmid, or an equimolar mix of the two plasmids. Cells transfected with the individual plasmids were harvested, washed at 4 °C, and split into two tubes. Recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) was added to one sample of the IL-15Rα transfected cells, and the sample was mixed with one of the IL-15 transfected cells and lysed. The other tubes were mixed and lysed in the absence of rhIL-15. The co-transfected cells were lysed in the presence or absence of rhIL-15. The cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation using agarose-anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and were subsequently examined by Western immunoblot analysis using an anti-IL-15Rα antibody. Protein stability analysis was performed after treatment of transfected cells with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells and media were harvested 0-80 min after treatment, and the IL-15 levels were quantified by ELISA. RNA Analysis–After transfection of 293 cells, cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using the PARIS kit (Ambion), according to the company protocol. Poly(A) RNA was purified using Dynabeads® Oligo(dT)25 (Dynal®) (36Ruckert R. Brandt K. Bulanova E. Mirghomizadeh F. Paus R. Bulfone-Paus S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), according to the protocol. RNA was transferred using the standard capillary transfer method onto Duralon-UV membranes (Stratagene) and hybridized using the QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. A DNA probe for the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region was synthesized using the Prime-It II random primer Labeling kit (Stratagene) and was used to detect IL-15 and IL-15Rα. The membrane was then stripped and rehybridized using a probe specific for cellular GAPDH mRNA as internal control. Localization of IL-15·IL-15Rα Complexes–Twenty four hours after transfection, human 293 cells were harvested, stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human IL-15 (IC247IP, R & D Systems), and analyzed by flow cytometry using the LSR (BD Biosciences). For confocal microscopy, HeLa cells were transfected by Superfect (Invitrogen) with 0.1 μg of IL-15-FLAG plasmid alone or in combination with 0.1 μg of the IL-15Rα or IL-15sRα plasmid. Twenty four hours later, the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and either permeabilized or directly surface-stained using mouse anti-FLAG (1:2000 dilution) and Alexa-488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen). In Vivo Hydrodynamic DNA Delivery–Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Frederick, MD). Hydrodynamic injection of the plasmid DNA (37Liu F. Song Y. Liu D. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) encoding IL-15 and/or IL-15Rα was performed essentially as described (38Ortaldo J.R. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Bere Jr., E.W. Watanabe M. Murphy W.J. Wiltrout R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IL-15t plasmid alone or in combination with IL-15Rα plasmid in 1.6 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl were injected into mice through the tail vein within 7 s using a 27.5-gauge needle. Mice were bled at day 1 and day 3 after injection, and the serum levels of IL-15 were measured using human IL-15 chemiluminescent immunoassay (Quanti-Glo, R & D Systems). Three days after injection, mice were sacrificed, and liver, lungs, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected and analyzed. Spleen, Lung, and Liver Cell Analysis–To make single cell suspensions, spleens were gently squeezed through a 100-μm Cell Strainer (Thomas) and washed in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) to remove any remaining organ stroma. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and counted using acridine orange (Molecular Probes)/ethidium bromide (Fisher) dye. Lung and liver were minced and incubated with 200 units/ml of collagenase (Sigma) and 30 units/ml of DNase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C, and single cells were then collected and resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The bioactivity of IL-15 in vivo was monitored by analyzing the frequency of NK and T cells in liver, lung, and spleen using multicolor flow cytometry. Briefly, the cells were washed in FACS buffer containing 0.2% fetal calf serum and stained with the following panel of conjugated rat anti-mouse antibodies: CD3-APCCy7, CD4-PerCP, CD8-PECy7, CD44-APC, CD49b-FITC, and CD62L-PE (Pharmingen). Samples were acquired using FACSAria (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). Statistical Analysis–The p values for all the in vivo analyses were determined by one-way analysis of variance, Dunnett's multiple comparison test, for comparisons of different experimental groups of mice with one control group (receiving IL-15t). Correlations of serum IL-15 level with an IL-15 effects in vivo (spleen and lymph node weight, blood counts, or number of NK in lung) were determined by linear or nonlinear regression curve fit. IL-15Rα Co-expression Stabilizes IL-15–The low expression of IL-15 has been attributed to the complex regulation of the gene at the levels of transcription, translation, protein trafficking, and secretion (28Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Waldmann T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 29Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y. Annu. Rev.

Pohl T. Krause H. Bulfone-Paus S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 255-262PubMed Google Scholar). IL-15 mRNA is unstable, and its expression is significantly improved by RNA/codon optimization (34Jalah R. Rosati M. Kulkarni V. Patel V. Bergamaschi C. Valentin A. Zhang G.-M. Sidhu M.K. Eldridge J.H. Weiner D.B. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2007; 26: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as shown previously for other mRNAs with low stability (33Schneider R. Campbell M. Nasioulas G. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4892-4903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Schwartz S. Campbell M. Nasioulas G. Harrison J. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7176-7182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Schwartz S. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 150-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also reported that IL-15 expression/secretion is decreased because of its native long signal peptide (LSP) (41Kutzler M.A. Robinson T.M. Chattergoon M.A. Choo D.K. Choo A.Y. Choe P.Y. Ramanathan M.P. Parkinson R. Kudchodkar S. Tamura Y. Sidhu M. Roopchand V. Kim J.J. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. Waldmann T.A. Boyer J.D. Weiner D.B. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We therefore increased IL-15 production by replacing LSP with the secretory signal of the tPA, generating IL-15t (34Jalah R. Rosati M. Kulkarni V. Patel V. Bergamaschi C. Valentin A. Zhang G.-M. Sidhu M.K. Eldridge J.H. Weiner D.B. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2007; 26: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that the optimized IL-15t expression plasmid produces >100-fold more protein than the wild type IL-15 coding sequence. Similarly, we generated RNA/codon optimized expression vectors for the complete IL-15Rα as well as for IL-15sRα, the secreted extracellular part of the receptor, to study the effects of both cell-associated and non-cell-associated IL-15Rα. The synthetic coding regions were expressed using the human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) and bovine growth hormone poly(A) site, as described under “Material and Methods.” We studied expression of these improved vectors after co-transfection in human 293 cells. Fig. 1 shows expression of human IL-15t alone or in combination with the IL-15Rα expression vectors. Interestingly, IL-15t co-expression with full-length IL-15Rα or the secreted IL-15sRα resulted in a great increase of cytokine production (∼5- and ∼7-fold, respectively, see Fig. 1A). Approximately half of the produced IL-15 was cell-associated upon co-transfection with the complete IL-15Rα. In contrast, IL-15t co-expression with IL-15sRα resulted in secretion of more than 90% of IL-15 into the medium. The results of IL-15 quantification were also verified by Western immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis of cells transfected with the IL-15 expression vector in the presence or absence of IL-15Rα expression plasmid (Fig. 1B) revealed high levels of IL-15 at the cell surface only in the presence of full-length IL-15Rα. In contrast, co-expression of IL-15 with the soluble IL-15sRα resulted in rapid secretion of IL-15 to the medium and no retention of IL-15 at the cell surface (Fig. 1B). Transfected cells were also examined for IL-15 localization by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C). Cytoplasmic IL-15 was detected in permeabilized cells transfected with the IL-15 expression vector. High levels of surface IL-15 were detected only in the presence of full-length IL-15Rα. Co-expression of the soluble IL-15sRα did not show any surface staining (data not shown). IL-15 Stabilizes IL-15Rα–We also examined the effect of IL-15 on IL-15Rα expression. Human 293 cells were transfected with IL-15Rα (Fig. 2A) or IL-15sRα (Fig. 2B), in the presence or absence of IL-15t. Culture supernatants and cell lysates were monitored for IL-15Rα expression by Western immunoblot. To quantify the results, serial dilutions of the samples were analyzed. Interestingly, co-expression with IL-15 led to increased accumulation of both the membrane-associated receptor (Fig. 2A, top panel; ∼3-fold) as well as the cleaved IL-15sRα in the medium (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Similarly, co-expression of a plasmid producing exclusively the IL-15sRα with IL-15 led to increased levels of IL-15sRα in the medium (Fig. 2B, bottom panel; ∼8-fold). Thus, increase in the steady-state level of IL-15Rα or IL-15sRα by IL-15 is similar to the increase in IL-15 upon IL-15Rα co-expression (Fig. 1). We noted that expression of the membrane-associated full-length IL-15Rα (59 kDa), both in the presence and absence of co-expressed IL-15, resulted in substantial quantities of the soluble extracellular 42-kDa form found in the culture supernatants (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). This is consistent with the rapid cleavage of the receptor and the generation of the soluble form, which is secreted in the medium. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the cleavage of IL-15Rα from the membrane occurred within 2 h after translation, whereas the soluble receptor form produced from the IL-15sRα expression plasmid was detected in the medium within 30 min (data not shown). Expression of the soluble IL-15sRα showed that, in the absence of IL-15, most of the produced IL-15sRα remained cell-associated (Fig. 2B). Western immunoblot analysis revealed two predominant forms of IL-15sRα migrating as ∼28 and ∼30 kDa, respectively, in addition to the mature 42-kDa protein. They represent nonglycosylated and partially glycosylated forms of IL-15Rα. It has been reported previously that both the full-length and the soluble IL-15Rα are N- and O-glycosylated (27Dubois S. Magrangeas F. Lehours P. Raher S. Bernard J. Boisteau O. Leroy S. Minvielle S. Godard A. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26978-26984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Low levels of the mature IL-15sRα (42 kDa) were found cell-associated (Fig. 2B, top panel), whereas most of the 42-kDa form was secreted in the medium (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). In the presence of co-expressed IL-15, the intracellular nonglycosylated and partially glycosylated forms were drastically reduced, whereas the mature, fully glycosylated 42-kDa protein was greatly increased in the extracellular compartment. Immunofluorescence experiments using an anti-IL-15Rα antibody also showed that the complete receptor was localized at the cell surface, whereas the soluble receptor was not (data not shown). It is interesting that IL-15sRα, a secretable molecule, is found intracellularly at higher levels compared with IL-15Rα, when expressed alone. IL-15 co-expression promotes rapid modification to the fully glycosylated 42-kDa form and secretion of this molecule. These results suggest an early intracellular association of IL-15 with the IL-15Rα during the production of these two molecules, which results in more efficient secretion. IL-15 and IL-15Rα Co-expression Does Not Alter the mRNA Levels–Co-expression of IL-15 and IL-15Rα after transfection is not expected to alter the expression of either of the two genes, because they are synthetic optimized constructs using the CMV promoter. To demonstrate this point directly, we compared mRNA expression of the two vectors after transfections either alone or in combination. mRNA was isolated and detected in Northern blots (Fig. 2C). As a loading control, levels of the cellular transcript for GAPDH were also probed on the same gel. There was no significant difference in the mRNA levels of IL-15 and IL-15Rα expressed alone or upon co-transfection. These results support the conclusion that co-expression affected the stability and not the production of the two proteins, because similar cytoplasmic mRNA levels were produced in both cases. Increased Stability of IL-15 Protein in the Presence of the Receptor–To show that the stability of IL-15 is increased when co-expressed with the IL-15Rα, we transfected 293 cells with the vectors expressing these molecules alone and in combination, and after 24 h we inhibited protein synthesis by cycloheximide.

https://openalex.org/W2130573743,"How chaperone interactions affect protein folding pathways is a central problem in biology. With the use of optical tweezers and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the effect of chaperone SecB on the folding and unfolding pathways of maltose binding protein (MBP) at the single-molecule level. In the absence of SecB, we find that the MBP polypeptide first collapses into a molten globulelike compacted state and then folds into a stable core structure onto which several α helices are finally wrapped. Interactions with SecB completely prevent stable tertiary contacts in the core structure but have no detectable effect on the folding of the external α helices. It appears that SecB only binds to the extended or molten globulelike structure and retains MBP in this latter state. Thus during MBP translocation, no energy is required to disrupt stable tertiary interactions."

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), the enzyme responsible for S1P production, is overexpressed in many solid tumors, including gliomas. One common feature of these tumors is the presence of “hypoxic regions,” characterized by cells expressing high levels of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α, two transcription regulators that modulate the levels of proteins with crucial roles in tumor progression. So far, nothing is known about the role and the regulation of SK1 during tumor-induced hypoxia or about SK1 regulation and HIFs. Here we investigated the role of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in the regulation of SK1 during hypoxic stress in glioma-derived U87MG cells. We report that hypoxia increases SK1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and enzyme activity, followed by intracellular S1P production and S1P release. Interestingly, knockdown of HIF-2α by small interfering RNA abolished the induction of SK1 and the production of extracellular S1P after CoCl2 treatment, whereas HIF-1α small interfering RNA resulted in an increase of HIF-2α and of SK1 protein levels. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrate that HIF-2α binds the SK1 promoter. Functionally, we demonstrate that conditioned medium from hypoxia-treated tumor cells results in neoangiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a S1P receptor-dependent manner. These studies provide evidence of a link between S1P production as a potent angiogenic agent and the hypoxic phenotype observed in many tumors.

Functionally, we demonstrate that conditioned medium from hypoxia-treated tumor cells results in neoangiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a S1P receptor-dependent manner. These studies provide evidence of a link between S1P production as a potent angiogenic agent and the hypoxic phenotype observed in many tumors.

S1P is a peculiar molecule acting both inside the cell on as yet undefined targets and as an extracellular mediator through binding to one of five cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors of the EDG family, recently renamed S1P1-5 receptors (5Payne S.G.

SK1 has been shown to act as an oncogene, whereby its overexpression regulates cell growth in soft agar and leads to tumor formation in xenograft model (29Xia P. Gamble J.R. Wang L. Pitson S.M.

Moreover, knockdown of SK1 has been shown to activate apoptotic pathways of cell death (15Taha T.A. Kitatani K. El-Alwani M. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Importantly, SK1 mRNA was found to be significantly higher in various tumor tissues, such as brain, breast, colon, lung, ovary, stomach, uterus, kidney, rectum, and small intestine. The elevated SK1 mRNA expression was confirmed by immunopositive staining for SK1 in lung and colon cancer (30Johnson K.R. Johnson K.Y. Crellin H.G. Ogretmen B. Boylan A.M. Harley R.A. Obeid L.M. J.

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most commonly occurring primary brain tumor in adults and displays aggressive growth and invasion into surrounding brain tissue, leading to a short life expectancy after the initial diagnosis. One of the key histopathological features of gliomas is an intense increased angiogenesis attributed to increased VEGF expression (32Plate K.H. Breier G. Weich H.A. Mennel H.D. Risau W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 520-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). S1P has been shown to enhance growth, migration, and invasiveness of glioblastoma multiforme cell lines (33Van Brocklyn J. Letterle C. Snyder P. Prior T. Cancer Lett. 2002; 181: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of SK1 in glioblastoma multiforme tissue has been shown to correlate with short patient survival (34Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Gliomas, similar to other malignant tumors, are characterized by extensive regions of low oxygen tension caused by rapid cell proliferation, leading to tissue hypoxia (35Kaur B. Khwaja F.W. Severson E.A. Matheny S.L. Brat D.J. Van Meir E.G. Neuro-oncol. 2005; 7: 134-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Central to the adaptive response that occurs in tumor hypoxia is a dramatic increase of protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which are key transcriptional regulators involved in the induction of a set of hypoxia-regulated genes. HIF is composed of an oxygen-regulated HIF-α subunit (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) and the ubiquitous aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (or HIF-1β) partner protein (36Srinivas V. Zhang L.P. Zhu X.H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HIF-α protein turnover in normoxia is very rapid due to the action of HIF-α prolyl hydroxylases. These oxygen-dependent enzymes hydroxylate two conserved proline residues of HIF-α proteins, promoting binding of the Von Hippel-Lindau protein, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteosomal degradation (37Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylases are inhibited, and HIF-α proteins are stabilized and transcriptionally activated, leading to potent induction of target genes. An important question in HIF biology is what roles the two HIF-α subunits exert on target gene activation, particularly the extent to which they cooperate, overlap, or have distinct roles. Although they exhibit high sequence homology and seem to be regulated in a similar fashion, it has been demonstrated that there is little redundancy between the two α subunits, and they have distinct expression and activation of target genes. For example, it has been shown that HIF-1α exclusively induces the hypoxic transcription of glycolytic genes, such as phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (pgk1) and aldolase A (aldA) (38Hu C.J. Wang L.Y. Chodosh L.A. Keith B. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 9361-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 39Wang V. Davis D.A. Haque M. Huang L.E. Yarchoan R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3299-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas HIF-2α induces VEGF and transforming growth factor α expression (38Hu C.J. Wang L.Y. Chodosh L.A. Keith B.

Cancer. 2004; 90: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that hypoxic stress induced S1P formation in vascular smooth muscle cells (42Yun J.K. Kester M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, acute hypoxia increased SK1 and SK2 mRNA transcript levels in human pulmonary smooth muscle cells (43Ahmad M. Long J.S. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2006; 79: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, cardiac myocytes null for the SK1 gene were shown to be more vulnerable to hypoxic stress (44Tao R. Zhang J. Vessey D.A. Honbo N. Karliner J.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role and regulation of SK during tumor-induced hypoxia or about SK regulation by HIFs. In this study, we show for the first time that SK1 protein, message, and SK activity are increased in tumor cell hypoxia and in response to CoCl2, a hypoxia-mimicking agent (45Yuan Y. Hilliard G. Ferguson T. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15911-15916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). This increase in SK1 is accompanied by an increase in cellular and released S1P. We also show that HIF-2α but not HIF-1α is required for the hypoxia-induced increases in SK1 and S1P. Moreover, we demonstrate that HIF-2α binds the SK1 promoter and that this binding is increased by hypoxia. In addition, we demonstrate that conditioned media from hypoxia-treated tumor cells results in neoangiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a S1P receptor-dependent manner.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α and HIF-2α were from Novus Biological. Rabbit anti-hSK1 was prepared by the Medical University of South Carolina antibody facility as previously described (39Wang V. Davis D.A. Haque M. Huang L.E. Yarchoan R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3299-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cell CulturesU87 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. 786-O cells were cultured under similar conditions in RPMI medium. HUVECs were cultured in endothelial cell medium-2 (EGM™-2) supplemented with 2% FCS and singleQuots®. For in vitro angiogenesis experiments, HUVECs were used between passages 2 and 8. Treatment of Cells with CoCl2 and HypoxiaCells at 70-80% confluence were serum-starved for 16 h in DMEM or RPMI containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and incubated in the absence or presence of 150 μm CoCl2. For the hypoxia experiments, cells were incubated for different times in a 5% CO2, 95% nitrogen incubator with an oxygen sensor set at 0.5% O2. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AnalysisThe ChIP assay was performed according to the protocol provided with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Briefly, U87 and 786-O cells at 70-80% confluence were serum-starved for 16 h in DMEM or RPMI containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and incubated in the absence or presence of 150 μm CoCl2 for 2 h. At the end of incubation, formaldehyde was added to the plate at 1% final concentration, and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1 ml of SDS lysis buffer, and sonicated three times for 10 min to shear DNA to an average fragment size of 200-1000 bp. Ten μl of each sonicated sample of cell lysate were removed and used as input control in the final PCRs. The supernatant was recovered, diluted, and precleared using Protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA. The recovered supernatant was incubated with either rabbit anti-HIF-1α, anti-HIF-2α, or an isotype control IgG overnight in the presence of Protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA. The beads were washed with low salt, high salt, and LiCl buffers. The immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted from the beads with 0.2% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 solution. Eluates were then incubated with 0.2 m NaCl for 4 h at 65 °C. DNA was then purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and PCR was done on the extracted DNA using Advantage-GC Genomic PCR (Clontech) with the following specific primers for different regions of SK1 promoter: A, 5′-gtttgagacgggtttctcca-3′ (forward) and 5′-cctttctccagacccctttc-3′ (reverse); B, 5′-tgaaccaggtgggctttatc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctccgagaaacaggaacgag-3′ (reverse); C, 5′-tcgttcctgtttctcggagt-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggagaggaggcttgacagtg-3′ (reverse); D, 5′-ggtcctccggaagagaagac-3′ (forward) and 5′-gattggaaagccaagcatgt-3′ (reverse). siRNA Down-regulation of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and S1P1 ExpressionHIF-1α was down-regulated using 50 nm sequence-specific siRNA from Invitrogen (Validated Stealth 46-3242; duplexes 1 and 2 showed similar knockdown results (see supplemental Fig. 2) and duplex 1 was used in all experiments). HIF-2α was down-regulated using 50 nm sequence-specific siRNA from Ambion (predesigned siRNA ID 106447 and 106448; both showed similar knockdown effectiveness (see supplemental Fig. 2), and the former was used in all experiments). S1P1 was down-regulated using 10 nm sequence-specific siRNA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc37086). Scrambled siRNA was synthesized from Xeragon (5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′) and was used as negative control. Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 24 h before down-regulation and transfected using Oligofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 μl of 20 μm siRNA (for HIF-1α and HIF-2α) or 2 μl of 10 μm (for S1P1) were resuspended in 400 μl of Opti-MEM medium and mixed with 30 μl of oligofectamine-opti-MEM medium complex (4:11, v/v). The mixture was then incubated for 20 min at room temperature and added to the cells (incubated for 20 min in 1.6 ml of Opti-MEM medium). After 4 h, 1 ml of 30% fetal bovine serum medium (DMEM or RPMI or EGM™-2) was added to the dishes, and the cells were further incubated for 48 h. The efficiency of the knockdown was determined by quantitative real time PCR for HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and S1P1 mRNA and immunoblotting using specific antibodies 48 h after transfection. Measurement of Promoter ActivityThe hSK1 promoter was cloned from human genomic DNA through PCR amplification of a 3-kb DNA segment upstream of the SK1 5′-untranslated region. This fragment was gel-purified and cloned into TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The putative SK1 promoter was excised using KpnI and NheI and ligated into the PGL3 Basic luciferase vector. U87MG cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells in 60-mm dishes for 24 h and treated with scrambled, HIF-1α, or HIF-2α siRNA for 24 h. Cells were then co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with 0.8 μg of SK1 promoter construct and 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid for 24 h. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h and treated with CoCl2 for 2 h. Cells were then lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase measurements were made using a luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme assay system kit (from Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data are normalized with β-galactosidase activity in each sample. Quantitative Real Time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), treated with the Turbo RNase-free kit (Ambion), and measured using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA kit (Invitrogen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time PCR was performed with an iCycler Q real time detection system using the SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad). Reactions were performed using hSK1-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-CTGGCAGCTTCCTTGAACCAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGTGCAGAGACAGCAGGTTCA-3′), hSK2-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-CCAGTGTTGGAGAGCTGAAGGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCCATTCATCTGCTGGTCCTC-3′), hHIF-1α-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-GAAAGCGCAAGTCCTCAAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGGTAGGAGATGGAGATGC-3′), hHIF-2α-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-TCCCACCAGCTTCACTCTCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCAGAAAAAGGCCACTGCTT-3′), and β-actin-specific primer (forward primer, 5′-ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACA-3′). Real time PCR conditions were as follows: 3 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles with 45 s at 60 °C, 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 10 min at 4 °C. Real time PCR results were analyzed using Q-Gene® software, which expresses data as mean normalized expression. All of the genes were normalized to expression of β-actin as an endogenous control. Sphingosine Kinase ActivitySphingosine kinase activity was determined as described previously with minor modifications (46Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After CoCl2 treatment cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in SK1 buffer (containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm deoxypyridoxine, 15 mm NaF, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitors). After brief sonication and protein concentration (determined by the BCA method), 30 μg of proteins were incubated in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing sphingosine (50 μm, delivered in 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin), [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi, 1 mm dissolved in 10 mm MgCl2), and SK1 buffer for 30 min at of 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 1 n HCl and 400 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v/v). Subsequently, 120 μl of chloroform and 120 μl of 2 m KCl were added, and samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. 200 μl of the organic phase was transferred to new glass tubes and dried. Samples were resuspended in chloroform/methanol/HCl (100: 100:1, v/v/v). Lipids were then resolved on silica thin layer chromatography plates using 1-butanol/methanol/acetic acid/water (8:2:1:2, v/v/v/v) as solvent system and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive spots corresponding to S1P were scraped from the plates and counted for radioactivity. Background values were determined in negative controls in which sphingosine was not added to the reaction mixture. In Vivo Assay for Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Formation and ReleaseU87MG cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm dishes and treated or not with siRNA for HIF-1α or HIF-2α. After 48 h, the medium was removed, and cells were serum-starved for 16 h and treated with CoCl2 for 2 h. At the end of incubation, cells were pulsed with 20 nm d-erythro-[3-3H] sphingosine (0.5 μCi/dish). Total lipids were extracted from cells at 4 °C with chloroform/methanol as previously reported (26Anelli V. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. Viani P. Riboni L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1204-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 47Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the total lipid extract was partitioned by the addition of 0.15 volumes of 0.1 m NH4OH, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. S1P in the upper phase was separated by high performance thin layer chromatography using n-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v/v). Bands corresponding to the S1P standard were scraped, and the radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. Extracellular S1P was extracted from pulse medium and partially purified as reported (26Anelli V. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. Viani P. Riboni L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1204-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The final organic phase containing S1P was submitted to high performance thin layer chromatography as above, and the S1P bands were scraped and counted as described above. Western Blot AnalysisWestern blot analysis was used to evaluate hSK1, HIF-1α, and HIF-2α. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) and kept on ice for 30 min. After brief sonication, protein concentration was determined using the BCA method, and 30 μg of protein was loaded on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with anti-hSK1, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and actin. Immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) and an ECL detection kit (Pierce). In Vitro Tube Formation AssayAn in vitro tube formation assay was performed to evaluate the angiogenic properties of U87MG-conditioned medium on endothelial cells. HUVECs were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a concentration of 5 × 105 and used when they reached 80% confluence. At the day of the experiment the fluorescent cellTracker™ Green CMFDA (Molecular Probes) was added to the cells at 5 μm final concentration and incubated for 45 min. Medium was then removed, and cells were further incubated for 4 h in EGM-2 medium (without fetal bovine serum and singleQuots®) containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA. At the end of the incubation, cells were trypsinized and seeded at 4 × 104 cells/cm2 in a 24-well plate precoated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel™ matrix (BD Biosciences) (450 μg/well of Matrigel diluted 1:1 with serum-free EGM-2) in DMEM, DMEM containing 100 nm S1P, or DMEM conditioned from U87 (incubated in 1 or 20% oxygen for 2 h) in the absence or presence of 1 μm VPC 23019.

This study presents a novel function of AKR1B10 in tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (RAO-3), regulating fatty acid synthesis. In RAO-3 cells, Sephacryl-S 300 gel filtration and DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography demonstrated that AKR1B10 exists in two distinct forms, monomers (∼40 kDa) bound to DEAE-Sepharose column and protein complexes (∼300 kDa) remaining in flow-through. Co-immunoprecipitation with AKR1B10 antibody and protein mass spectrometry analysis identified that AKR1B10 associates with acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACCA), a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis. This association between AKR1B10 and ACCA proteins was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation with ACCA antibody and pulldown assays with recombinant AKR1B10 protein. Intracellular fluorescent studies showed that AKR1B10 and ACCA proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm of RAO-3 cells. More interestingly, small interfering RNA-mediated AKR1B10 knock down increased ACCA degradation through ubiquitination-proteasome pathway and resulted in >50% decrease of fatty acid synthesis in RAO-3 cells.

During tumorigenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), AKR1B10 is up-regulated and associates with acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACCA). ACCA is a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo synthesis of long chain fatty acids, catalyzing the formation of malonyl-CoA by ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (11Witters L.A. Widmer J. King A.N.

Cell Culture and AKR1B10 Silencing by siRNARAO-1, RAO-2, and RAO-3 cells were cultured in DFCI-1 medium characterized previously (25Cheng J.M. Ding M. Aribi A. Shah P. Rao K. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For AKR1B10 gene silencing, small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) were synthesized and introduced into RAO-3 cells as described previously (9Yan R. Zu X. Ma J. Liu Z. Adeyanju M. Cao D. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 2301-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration30 ml of Sephacryl-S 300 (Amersham Biosciences) was packed into a column (10 × 300 mm) following the product instructions. RAO-3 cells (1 × 108) were lysed in a buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol) (26Moreau K.

Proteins were eluted with 10 mm KCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, at 0.2 ml/min and collected at 0.5 ml/fraction. Ferritin (440 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine albumin (67 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) were used as standards. Anion Exchanger ChromatographyTotal volume of 2 ml of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was packed into a column. RAO-3 cells were lysed in the buffer as described above. Soluble proteins were applied to the column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad) at 0.25 ml/min. Flow-through was collected. After being washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer, binding proteins were eluted with NaCl at a gradient of 10 to 1000 mm and collected at 0.5 ml/fraction. Co-immunoprecipitationRAO-3 cells were lysed as above. Soluble proteins (500 μg) were incubated with 5 μg of anti-AKR1B10 (refer tosupplemental data for activity and specificity of AKR1B10 antibody produced in our laboratory) or 5 μg of anti-ACCA (Cell Signaling) antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with 40 μl of slurry-Sepharose protein A/G beads at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. Beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed five times with lysis buffer (see above). Proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and separated on 8–12% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot. Rabbit IgG (5 μg) was used as a negative control. Mass Spectrometry AssayCo-purified protein by immunoprecipitation was collected from SDS-PAGE. Gel slices were destained and digested in 25 μl of sequencing grade trypsin (12.5 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate; G-Biosciences) at 37 °C overnight. The digested sample was dried using a Savant SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 13 μl of 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. 10 μl of sample was used for mass spectrometry analysis. A quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters DEME-ToF) connected to a Waters nano Acquity UPLC was used for mass spectrometry analysis. Column used was Waters Atlantis C-18 (0.03-mm particle, 0.075 × 150 mm). Flow rate was at 250 nl/min. Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid from water to acetonitrile in 60 min. The mass spectrometer was set for data-dependent acquisition; tandem mass spectrometry was performed on the top three peaks at any given time. Data analysis was done using Waters Protein Lynx Global Server 2.2.5, MASCOT (Matrix Sciences) and PEAKS (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc. Waterloo, ON, Canada), and blasted against the NCBI NR data base. Western Blot AnalysisWestern blot was performed as previously described (8Zu X. Yan R. Robbins S. Krishack P.A. Liao D.F. Cao D. Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 97: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ACCA antibody was used at 1:1000 in blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences). Recombinant AKR1B10 Protein Preparation and Pulldown AssayRecombinant AKR1B10 protein with His tag was purified as described previously (8Zu X. Yan R. Robbins S. Krishack P.A. Liao D.F. Cao D. Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 97: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (Refer tosupplemental data for quality of protein.) To perform pulldown assay, 5 μg of recombinant AKR1B10 protein was incubated with 500 μg of soluble protein (cell lysates) at 4 °C for 2 h. Ni-NTA-agarose beads (40 μl) were then added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After brief centrifugation, Ni-NTA-agarose beads were pelleted and washed with lysis buffer (see above) five times. Proteins were released by heating at 95 °C in 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 3 min and subjected to Western blot. A Ni-NTA-agarose bead control was run in parallel. Transient Transfection and Fluorescent LocalizationAKR1B10-EGFP fusion protein expression vector was transfected into RAO-3 cells as previously described (8Zu X. Yan R. Robbins S. Krishack P.A. Liao D.F. Cao D. Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 97: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After culture for 48 h, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min and then in acetone for 1 min, followed by incubation with ACCA antibody (1:10) at 4 °C overnight. Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody (1:1000; GeneTex) was used to visualize ACCA antibody. Dual-color detection by confocal laser scan microscopy (TCS SP2 system; Leica, Bensheim, Germany) was performed for cellular distribution and localization of AKR1B10-EGFP and ACCA proteins. Fatty Acid SynthesisFatty acid synthesis was determined by measuring radiolabeled acetic acid incorporation. In 24-well plates, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of 14C-labeled acetic acid (Moravek) for 4 h. Cells were trypsinized and washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times. One fourth of the cell suspension was lysed for protein quantitation with protein assay dye (Bio-Rad). The remainder was mixed vigorously with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). After incubation on ice for 10 min, debris was removed at 21,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was washed with 0.2 volume of dH2O. Aqueous phase and interface were removed, and organic phase was dried in speed vacuum. Lipids were dissolved in 4.0 ml of liquid scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was measured by a scintillation counter (Beckman). Statistic AnalysisStatistic analysis was performed using Student's t test with the INSTAT statistical analysis package (Graph Pad Software). Significance was defined as p < 0.05. AKR1B10 and ACCA are Up-regulated in Tumorigenic HMEC CellsIn a previous study, we generated a panel of HMEC cell models (25Cheng J.M. Ding M. Aribi A. Shah P. Rao K. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Primary HMEC cells were immortalized by a catalytic subunit of telomerase, generating RAO-1 cells. By introduction of activated H-RasQ61L into RAO-1 cells, RAO-2 and RAO-3 cells were isolated. RAO-2 cells with H-RasQ61L expression show transformational growth but are not tumorigenic in nude mice; RAO-3 cells possess an extra deletion of Rab25 gene besides H-RasQ61L expression and show anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumorigenesis in nude mice. In this study, we observed a tumorigenic-related up-regulation of both AKR1B10 and ACCA proteins in RAO-3 cells (Fig. 1). Two Distinct AKR1B10 Protein Complexes in RAO-3 CellsTo explore the biological function of the induced AKR1B10 protein in the tumorigenic RAO-3 cells, we first examined its biochemical properties. As shown in Fig. 2A, gel filtration chromatography exhibited two AKR1B10 protein peaks with masses of ∼40 and ∼300 kDa, respectively. To verify this finding, anion exchange chromatography was conducted using DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column. In this assay, AKR1B10 protein was present in two distinct portions. A portion of AKR1B10 remained in flow-through while the other bound to the column with elution at 200–300 mm NaCl (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Reloading the flow-through onto the gel filtration column revealed that AKR1B10 in flow-through represented the peak of ∼300 kDa (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The AKR1B10 bound to ion exchange column stood for the peak at ∼40 kDa (data not shown). These data indicate the existence of two distinct AKR1B10 forms in RAO-3 cells, monomers with calculated molecular mass of 36 kDa and complexes with a mass of ∼300 kDa, that associate with other protein(s). AKR1B10 Associates with ACCA in RAO-3 CellsTo identify proteins that associate with AKR1B10, immunoprecipitation was performed with a specific anti-AKR1B10 antibody generated in our laboratory. (Supplemental data demonstrate the activity and specificity of AKR1B10 antibody.) After separation on SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining indicated a candidate protein at ∼250 kDa, which was not present in the rabbit IgG control (Fig. 3A). AKR1B10 presence in precipitate was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3B). Protein mass spectrometry analysis identified that this candidate protein is ACCA with 265 kDa. Fig. 4 shows an example of mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests representing amino acids 244–266. Interestingly, association with AKR1B10 also altered ACCA binding to DEAE-Sepharose (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 4Candidate protein shown in Fig. 3 was identified as acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Ion 1141.6265 (2+) was fragmented by collision-induced dissociation de novo sequencing using the b and y ions confirmed the peptide corresponding to residues 244–266 (IASSIVAQTAGIPTLPWSGS) for acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Association of AKR1B10 with ACCA was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using ACCA-specific antibody and AKR1B10 protein pulldown assay. In RAO-3 cells, AKR1B10 protein was specifically co-precipitated by ACCA antibody (Fig. 5A) and ACCA was pulled down by histidine-tagged recombinant AKR1B10 protein (Fig. 5B). (Refer to supplementary data for the quality of AKR1B10 recombinant protein.) In addition, intracellular fluorescent studies showed that ectopic AKR1B10-EGFP co-localizes with cellular ACCA protein in the cytoplasm of RAO-3 cells (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Intracellular localization. EGFP-tagged AKR1B10 protein was transiently transfected into RAO-3 cells on coverslides. After incubation for 48 h, ACCA protein was labeled by primary and secondary (conjugated with Texas red) antibodies as described under Materials and Methods.

At first, we checked ACCA protein degradation pathways in RAO-3 cells. Fig. 7A shows that exposing RAO-3 cells to epoxomicin, a proteasome inhibitor, resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of ACCA protein, indicating its degradation through ubiquitination-proteasome pathway as reported previously (27Qi L. Heredia J.E. Altarejos J.Y. Screaton R. Goebel N. Niessen S. Macleod I.X. Liew C.W. Kulkarni R.N. Bain J. Newgard C. Nelson M. Evans R.M. Yates J. Montminy M.

Thereafter, we down-regulated AKR1B10 protein in RAO-3 cells with chemically synthesized siRNA 1 and 2 characterized in our previous studies (9Yan R. Zu X. Ma J. Liu Z. Adeyanju M. Cao D. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 2301-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and examined ACCA protein levels. As shown in Fig. 7B, AKR1B10 knock down caused a notable decrease of ACCA protein levels. This ACCA protein reduction was blocked by proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin, suggesting that by direct association AKR1B10 prevents ACCA degradation through ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we examined the effect of AKR1B10 knock down on de novo fatty acid synthesis in RAO-3 cells by measuring the incorporation of 14C-labeled acetic acid. The results showed that AKR1B10 knock down resulted in >50% decrease of fatty acid syntheses (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these data suggest that AKR1B10 affects fatty acid synthesis via regulating ACCA stability. Lipogenic alterations are early events of cancer development. In many types of cancers, lipogenic genes such as fatty acid synthase and ACCA are up-regulated (14Swinnen J.V. Heemers H. van de Sande T. de Schrijver E. Brusselmans K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J.

For instance, fatty acid synthase is overexpressed in the earliest stages of prostate neoplastic transformation (PIN lesions) and expression levels are positively related to the grades of PIN lesions and invasive carcinomas (16Swinnen J.V.

Recent studies have demonstrated that in tumor cells newly synthesized lipids are mainly phospholipids, the major components of cell membranes, meeting the need of rapid cell division. More importantly, newly synthesized lipids are enriched with saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids tend to partition into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains or rafts, which mediate cell migration, signal transduction, and intracellular trafficking (13Rouquette-Jazdanian A.K.

In this study, we found that AKR1B10 is up-regulated in tumorigenic RAO-3 cells and in turn regulates ACCA stability and fatty acid synthesis, indicating its role in cancer development. This functional study of AKR1B10 protein up-regulated in RAO-3 cells started with Sephacyl-S300 gel filtration and DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. The results demonstrated that AKR1B10 protein exists in two distinct forms in RAO-3 cells. One (∼40 kDa) bound to the DEAE-Sepharose column while the other (∼300 kDa) remained in flow-through. The latter is a protein complex with different ion exchange properties (Fig. 2). Using co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown assay, and mass spectrometry analysis, we discovered that ACCA (265 kDa) is the protein associating with AKR1B10 in RAO-3 cells, and intracellularly, ectopic AKR1B10 tagged with EGFP demonstrated a co-localization with ACCA protein. Similar results were observed in HCT-8 cells, a colon adenocarcinoma cell line (data not shown). ACCA catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, forming malonyl-CoA. It is the rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (12Zang Y. Wang T. Xie W. Wang-Fischer Y.L. Getty L. Han J. Corkey B.E. Guo W. Obes. Res. 2005; 13: 1530-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In normal tissues, ACCA activity is tightly regulated by both metabolite-mediated allosteric and phospho-dependent regulations. The latter is triggered by different hormones, such as insulin, glucagon, and growth factors (32Brownsey R.W. Boone A.N. Elliott J.E. Kulpa J.E. Lee W.M. Biochem. Soc.

In MCF7 breast cancer cells, breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) protein, via the BRCT tandem domain at C terminus, specifically associates with ACCA and regulates its enzymatic activity by blocking Ser79 residue from dephosphorylation, mediating fatty acid synthesis (26Moreau K. Dizin E. Ray H. Luquain C. Lefai E. Foufelle F. Billaud M. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. J. Biol.

To explore the physiological function of AKR1B10-ACCA association, we down-regulated AKR1B10 protein using two siRNAs that target the encoding (siRNA 1) and 3′-untranslational (siRNA 2) regions of AKR1B10 mRNA. These two siRNAs were well characterized in our previous studies, resulting in >60% (siRNA 1) and 90% (siRNA 2) knock down of AKR1B10 protein, respectively (9Yan R. Zu X. Ma J. Liu Z. Adeyanju M. Cao D. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 2301-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, AKR1B10 knock down induced a notable decrease of ACCA protein and subsequent reduction (>50%) of fatty acid synthesis. The fact that ACCA protein degradation induced by AKR1B10 silencing was blocked by epoxomicin, a proteasome inhibitor, suggests that AKR1B10 binds to ACCA and prevents its degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. These data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of ACCA activity and fatty acid synthesis. Further studies are in progress to identify the functional domains and binding sites in these proteins. In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time that AKR1B10, induced in tumorigenic HMEC cells, affects fatty acid synthesis by regulating the stability of ACCA protein and thus becomes a novel target for the modulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells.

One mechanism by which c-Met deregulation leads to cancer is through gain-of-function mutations. Therefore, small molecules capable of targeting these mutations could offer therapeutic benefits for affected patients. SU11274 was recently described and reported to inhibit the activity of the wild-type and some mutant forms of c-Met, whereas other mutants are resistant to inhibition. We identified a novel series of c-Met small molecule inhibitors that are active against multiple mutants previously identified in hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma patients. AM7 is active against wild-type c-Met as well as several mutants, inhibits c-Met-mediated signaling in MKN-45 and U-87 MG cells, and inhibits tumor growth in these two models grown as xenografts. The crystal structures of AM7 and SU11274 bound to unphosphorylated c-Met have been determined. The AM7 structure reveals a novel binding mode compared with other published c-Met inhibitors and SU11274. The molecule binds the kinase linker and then extends into a new hydrophobic binding site. This binding site is created by a significant movement of the C-helix and so represents an inactive conformation of the c-Met kinase. Thus, our results demonstrate that it is possible to identify and design inhibitors that will likely be active against mutants found in different cancers. c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase often deregulated in human cancers, thus making it an attractive drug target.

However, deregulation of c-Met activity is common in human cancers and is associated with poor outcome (1Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Most of these intervention strategies have shown anti-tumor activity in preclinical animal models; however, their clinical utility remains to be determined. Whereas some of these approaches are better suited to block ligand-mediated c-Met activity, small molecule kinase inhibitors offer the most versatile approach by inhibiting HGF-dependent tumors as well as tumors driven by other c-Met-dependent mechanisms, such as receptor amplification and activating mutations.Clinical experience with small molecule kinase inhibitors has demonstrated that the selectivity of some of these inhibitors for wild-type versus mutant can be a cause of drug resistance (primary drug resistance in the case of pre-existing mutations or acquired resistance due to chronic treatment). For example, imatinib blocks the kinase activity of wild-type Abl and c-Kit but has weaker or no activity against several acquired mutations that arise as a result of imatinib therapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients (23Shah N.P.

A well documented mechanism of imatinib-acquired resistance results from the inability of imatinib to bind to the active conformation adopted by the Abl mutants. This type of resistance can be overcome by other drugs such as dasatinib, an inhibitor of Abl that can bind to both the inactive and the active form of the Abl kinase domain (27Shah N.P. Tran C.

The clinical activity of imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumor is similarly related to the type of mutations found in these tumors.

(H1112Y) and M1250T (M1268T), but that other mutants such as L1195V (L1213V) and Y1230H (Y1248H) were resistant to this inhibitor. As established for imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, this information is critical to make decisions on patient treatment. Furthermore, these data imply that different c-Met inhibitors will be needed in the clinic to overcome the predicted resistance.We have identified novel, selective c-Met small molecule inhibitors that inhibit several c-Met mutations found in hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma patients that were shown to be resistant to SU11274. We have determined the crystal structure of a representative of this new class of inhibitor bound to unphosphorylated c-Met and compared this structure with the crystal structure of SU11274 also bound to unphosphorylated c-Met. The binding modes of the two inhibitors overlap minimally, which is consistent with their differential abilities to inhibit these c-Met mutations. Our results demonstrate that c-Met inhibitors can bind to the receptor in a drastically different manner that influences their activity on c-Met mutants and that it is possible to identify agents that will inhibit a wide range of c-Met primary mutations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Bacmid Construction—The wild-type c-Met kinase domain (amino acid 1058–1365) was PCR-amplified from full-length c-Met and inserted into the BamHI-XhoI sites of the Invitrogen pFastBac 1 vector downstream of a GST tag and a thrombin cleavage site previously engineered in pFastBac 1. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the following mutations in the c-Met kinase domain: V1092I, H1094R, D1228H, Y1230H, M1250T. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The Invitrogen Bac-to-Bac protocol was followed to obtain recombinant bacmids.Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins—The bacmids were transfected with calcium phosphate into Sf9 cells. Resultant viruses were amplified in Sf9 cells. To express GST fusion proteins, Hi5 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml with a 10% viral addition. Protein expression was allowed to proceed for 48 h at 27 °C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors and then passed through a Microfluidizer three times. The lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were mixed with an appropriate amount of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin at 7 °C overnight. The GST-c-Met fusion proteins were eluted with buffer containing 10 mm glutathione, pooled, and concentrated. Phosphorylation of purified GST-c-Met was performed by mixing the following reactants to the final concentrations indicated: 0.5 mg/ml GST-c-Met, 25 mm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm Tris-HCl at room temperature for 3 h. The identity of all proteins was confirmed by Western blotting.In Vitro Kinase Assay—IC50 measurements of AM7 versus c-Met kinase and its mutants were determined using homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assays as previously described (35Polverino A.

Molecules were tested in a 10-point serial dilution for each c-Met construct using an ATP concentration of two-thirds the Km value that was determined for each enzyme preparation and calculated using the Eadie-Hofstee and Lineweaver-Burke methods.Cells—PC3, CT26, A431, and U-87 MG were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and MKN-45 human gastric carcinoma cells were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Japan). Cells were grown as monolayers using standard cell culture conditions.Cell-based Autophosphorylation Assay of c-Met—IC50 measurements of AM7 activity on HGF-mediated c-Met autophosphorylation was determined in serum-starved PC-3 (human) or CT26 (mouse) cells using a quantitative electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. PC3 and CT26 cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates. 24 h after plating cells were starved in media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 18–20 h. Cells were then treated with a 10-point serial dilution of AM7 for 1 h at 37 °C followed by stimulation with optimal concentrations of recombinant human HGF for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 300 μm Na3OV4, and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were incubated with a biotin-labeled goat-anti-c-Met antibody (BAF358, for human c-Met; BAF527, for mouse c-Met; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for capture followed by a mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) and a BV-tag™ labeled anti-mouse IgG (BioVeris Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as the detection antibody. Levels of c-Met phosphorylation were then measured on a BioVeris M-Series instrument. The IC50 values are calculated using Xlfit4-parameter equation.Immunoblot Analysis—MKN-45 cells were serum-starved for 18–20 h before treatment with increasing concentrations of AM7 for 1 h at 37 °C. U-87 MG cells were similarly treated or received human HGF for 10 min after treatment with AM7. Monoclonal antibody 2.4.4 (9Burgess T. Coxon A. Meyer S. Sun J. Rex K. Tsuruda T. Chen Q. Ho S.Y. Li L.

Western blots were done using standard procedures and probed with the following antibodies: anti-c-Met (C12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-c-Met (Tyr-1234/1235), anti-phospho-Gab-1 (Tyr-627), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-phospho-p70S6K (Thr-421/Ser-424), anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-240/244) and anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473), anti-phospho PRAS40 (Thr-246) (BIOSOURCE Inc., Camarillo, CA).Xenograft—Efficacy studies were performed in 7–8-week-old female CD1 nu/nu mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Animals were housed in sterilized cages on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum in compliance with all Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) specifications. All of the procedures were conducted in accordance with Amgen's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. U-87 MG tumor cells (5 × 106 cells per animal) or MKN-45 (3 × 106 cells per animal with Matrigel™ in a 2:1 ratio) were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank of the mice (n = 10 per group) on day 0. Twice daily (BID) treatment with AM7 or vehicle (Ora Plus®) was administered by oral gavage for up to 27 days. Treatment was initiated when tumors were ∼200 mm3 in volume (U-87 MG) or 1 day after tumor implantation (MKN-45). Mice were randomized into treatment groups based on tumor volume and body weight using a computer-generated randomization program. Tumors were measured twice weekly using Pro-Max Fowler Digital Ultra Calipers (Fred Fowler Co., Boston, MA), and tumor volumes were calculated as length × width × height in mm3. Body weight was measured on a digital scale. Percent tumor growth inhibition was calculated from the final tumor measurements as 100 - (mean-treated tumor volume/mean vehicle-treated tumor volume × 100). At sacrifice, resected tumors were fixed in aqueous buffered zinc formalin (Anatech, LTD, Battle Creek, MI), paraffin embedded, and sectioned for immunohistochemistry.Immunohistochemistry—Deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with Antigen Retrieval Citra (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). Sections were blocked with CAS-BLOCK (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody Ki67 antigen (catalog #VP-K451, lot number 301113; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The antibody was detected with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (catalog #BA-1000, lot #R0207; Vector Laboratories). Tissue sections were quenched with Peroxidase Blocking Solution (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) and detected with Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Reaction sites were visualized with liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromagen System (DAKO Corp.) and counterstained with hematoxylin.Crystallography—Crystals of c-Met (residues 1048–1350 with an His6 tag at the C terminus) were grown at room temperature by vapor diffusion. SU11274 was obtained from Calbiochem (#448101). Compounds were dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 20 mm and then mixed with c-Met protein to a final Me2SO concentration of 4% before crystallization. Crystals of AM7 were grown from 12% polyethylene glycol 6000, 1.0 m LiCl2, and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0. Large crystals suitable for data collection were obtained by microseeding. Crystals of SU11274 were grown from 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.8, 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 6% 2-propanol, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 3% ethanol. Data were collected on a FRE equipped with an RaxisII++ and scaled by using Denzo/Scalepack to 2.4 Å (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the published c-Met structure 1R1W as a search model and the program AMORE. The structures were built and refined by using COOT and REFMAC (Table 1). All figures were prepared using PyMOL. Coordinates and experimental data have been deposited with accession codes 2RFN and 2RFS for the structures of AM7 and SU11274, respectively.

All data analysis were performed using SAS V9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).RESULTSAM7 Is a c-Met Inhibitor—The structure of AM7 (5-(3-fluoro-4-((6-(methyloxy)-7-((3-(4 morpholinyl)propyl)oxy)-4-quinolinyl)oxy)phenyl)-3-methyl-2-(phenylmethyl)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone) is shown in Fig. 1A. AM7 inhibits c-Met kinase activity with an IC50 of 17 nm and shows good selectivity against a panel of kinases (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Despite showing significant inhibitory effect on Lck and BTK kinase activity, AM7 had weak activity in an Lck- and a BTK-dependent cell assay with IC50s in the μm range (data not shown). The only significant activity of AM7 in a cell-based assay identified to date is against c-Met. As shown in Fig. 1B, AM7 inhibits c-Met autophosphorylation mediated by HGF in mouse CT26 and human PC3 cells with IC50 values of 130 and 94 nm, respectively.To confirm the inhibitory activity of AM7 on c-Met, we tested its effect on signaling in two c-Met-dependent models. MKN-45 cells are derived from a poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma and have constitutive c-Met activity due to amplification of the receptor (38Rege-Cambrin G. Scaravaglio P. Carozzi F.

Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). This point is well illustrated in cells with constitutive c-Met activity such as the MKN-45 cells. Fig. 2A shows that c-Met as well as several downstream signaling molecules are activated as shown by their phosphorylation status in serum-starved MKN-45 cells. AM7 inhibited c-Met constitutive phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of the receptor activity also resulted in the inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of c-Met. Phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Gab1, a major substrate for c-Met (39Nguyen L. Holgado-Madruga M. Maroun C. Fixman E.D. Kamikura D. Fournier T. Charest A. Tremblay M.L. Wong A.J. Park M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2015803078,"Activating transcription factor (ATF) 5 is a transcription factor belonging to the ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein gene family. We previously reported that ATF5 mRNA expression increased in response to amino acid limitation. The ATF5 gene allows transcription of mRNAs with at least two alternative 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs), 5′-UTRα and 5′-UTRβ, derived from exon1α and exon1β. 5′-UTRα contains highly conserved sequences, in which the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) uORF1 and uORF2 are found in many species. This study was designed to investigate the potential role of 5′-UTRs in translational control. These 5′-UTRs differentially determined translation efficiency from mRNA. The presence of 5′-UTRα or 5′-UTRβ represses translation from the downstream ATF5 ORF. Moreover, 5′-UTRα-regulated translational repression is released by amino acid limitation or NaAsO2 exposure. This release was not seen for 5′-UTRβ. Mutation of uAUG2 in the uORF2 of 5′-UTRα restored the basal expression and abolished the positive regulation by amino acid limitation or arsenite exposure. We demonstrated that phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α was required for amino acid limitation-induced translational regulation of ATF5. Furthermore, arsenite exposure activated the exogenously expressed heme-regulated inhibitor kinase and induced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α in nonerythroid cells. These results suggest that translation of ATF5 is regulated by the alternative 5′-UTR region of its mRNA, and ATF5 may play a role in protecting cells from amino acid limitation or arsenite-induced oxidative stress.

Mammalian cells have the ability to alter their gene expression to adapt to a variety of environmental stresses, including nutrient limitation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, although the exact molecular events controlling the stress response have not been fully elucidated. Recently, we discovered that ATF5 is a stress response transcription factor that responds to amino acid limitation (8Watatani Y. Kimura N. Shimizu Y.I. Akiyama I. Tonaki D. Hirose H. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Life Sci. 2007; 80: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of amino acid limitation on ATF5 mRNA levels in a mammalian cell line. Limitation of a single amino acid (glutamine, methionine, or leucine) increased ATF5 mRNA levels in HeLaS3 cells. This resulted at least in part from increased half-life of the ATF5 mRNA. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of translation, suppresses the glutamine limitation-induced increase in ATF5 mRNA, indicating that this increase depends on de novo protein synthesis. Relatively few studies have been performed to characterize ATF5 and its biological functions. The amino acid sequence of ATF5 is closely related to that of ATF4, another member of the CREB/ATF transcription factor family. ATF4 expression is also affected by amino acid availability and regulates target genes in an amino acid-dependent manner (9Harding H.P. Novoa Y.Z. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

In mammals, four eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α kinases recognize distinct stress signals, phosphorylate eIF2α, and inhibit protein synthesis via translational control (13Hoplick M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). These eIF2α kinases are general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2), which is activated by nutritional limitation, RNA-activated protein kinase-related ER kinase/pancreatic EIF2α kinase (PERK/PEK), which is activated by protein malfolding because of ER stress, double strand RNA-activated protein kinase, which is activated in response to viral infection, and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), which is activated by heme deficiency in the erythroid lineage. HRI is also activated in response to oxidative stresses in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (14Zhan K. Narasimhan J. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2004; 168: 1867-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and MEF cells (15McEwen E. Kedersha N. Song B. Scheuner D. Gilks N. Han A. Chen J-J. Anderson P. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of eIF2α reduces the levels of eIF2-GTP available for initiation of translation and contributes to lowered global protein synthesis coincident with induced translational expression of genes that function in the stress response. The levels of the transcription factor ATF4 are increased in response to phosphorylation of eIF2α during amino acid limitation, ER stress, or hypoxia.

The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of ATF4 mRNA contains two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that are conserved among species and regulate translation. Under nonstressed conditions, low level eIF2α phosphorylation favors reinitiation of translation at uAUG2 by scanning ribosomes, which precludes translation of the ATF4 ORF. Under stressed conditions, highly phosphorylated eIF2α decreases ribosome assembly and favors re-initiation of translation at the ATF4 ORF located downstream of uORF2, resulting in ATF4 protein production. The human ATF5 gene has at least two exon1s, exon1α and exon1β (19Hansen M.B. Mitchelmore C. Kjærulff K.M. Rasmussen T.E. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the gene is transcribed into at least two mRNAs encoding the same single 30-kDa protein. We designated them ATF5-R1 and ATF5-R2. These exon1s encode alternative 5′-UTRs of ATF5 mRNA, designated ATF5-5′-UTRα and ATF5-5′-UTRβ. Whether these alternative 5′-UTRs have different properties for the expression of the ATF5 protein remains to be elucidated. Alignment of the 5′-UTRα of human, mouse, and rat ATF5 mRNA reveals high identity and the presence of two putative translation start sites (uAUG1 and uAUG2). It also reveals mRNA with a similar two-uORF configuration (Fig. 1C). These observations led us to investigate the potential role of 5′-UTR in the translational control of ATF5 expression. In this study, we report that a uORF located in the ATF5-R1 mRNA inhibited the translation of ATF5 mRNA. This repression was released by stresses, including nutrient limitation and exposure to arsenite, via eIF2α phosphorylation. The 5′-UTR of ATF5-R2 mRNA inhibited translation of ATF5 mRNA, but amino acid limitation did not release the translational repression. These findings suggest that translation of ATF5 mRNA is differentially regulated by the alternative 5′-UTRs, and ATF5 induction via 5′-UTRα may be a protective response of cells that are deprived of amino acids or exposed to oxidative stress.

The resultant ATF5 5′-UTRα or -β fragment was inserted into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which was digested with NcoI, blunted with T4DNA polymerase, and digested with NheI to produce pGL3-Basic-ATF5-5′-UTRα or pGL3-Basic-ATF5-5′-UTRβ. pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was digested with MluI and NheI to produce a CMV promoter/enhancer fragment. This fragment was inserted into the pGL3-Basic-ATF5-5′-UTRα and pGL3-Basic-ATF5-5′-UTRβ, which were digested with MluI and NheI to produce pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC and pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRβ-LUC. As a 5′-UTR-less control plasmid, pGL3-CMV was constructed by inserting the above CMV promoter/enhancer fragment into pGL3-Basic digested with MluI/NheI. A mutation of the first ATG in the uORF1 of pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC at position +74 to +76 by replacement of the bases ATG with TTG to construct pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα mt1-LUC was introduced by PCR with the mutagenic primers ATF5-uAUG1mt-F, 5′-CCCGGCCTTGGCTCTGTAG-3′, and ATF5-uAUG1mt-R, 5′-CTACAGAGCCAAGGCCGGG-3′. A mutation of the first ATG in the uORF2 of pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC at position +196 to +198 by replacement of the bases ATG with TTG to construct pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRαmt2-LUC was introduced by PCR with the mutagenic primers ATF5-uAUG2mt-F, 5′-CTGCAGCCTTGGAGTCTTC-3′, and ATF5-uAUG2mt-R, 5′-GAAGACTCCAAGGCTGCAG-3′. To mutate both of the ATGs in uORF1 and -2, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRαmt1-LUC with the primers ATF5-uAUG2mt-F and ATF5-uAUG2mt-R. All mutagenic sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The resultant mutagenic plasmids were digested with NarI and NheI to produce ATF5-5′-UTRαmt1, ATF5-5′-UTRαmt2, and ATF5-5′-UTRαmt3. pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC was digested with NarI and NheI to remove the wild-type ATF5-5′-UTRα sequence. Then the ATF5-5′-UTRαmt1, ATF5-5′-UTRαmt2, and ATF5-5′-UTRαmt3 fragments were inserted into pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC/NarI/NheI to produce pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRαmt1-LUC, pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRαmt2-LUC, and pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRαmt3-LUC. The ATF5uORF/luciferase in-frame fusion construct was generated as follows (Fig. 3A). An ATF5-5′-UTR in-frame fusion fragment was amplified by PCR using pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC as a template. The primers used were ATF5-uORF-F and ATF5-uORF-R-IF, 5′-P-CTGTAGCACAGGTGCTGGGC-3′. The PCR product was digested with NheI, and the resultant ATF5-5′-uORF2 in-frame fusion fragment was inserted into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which was digested with NcoI, blunted with T4DNA polymerase, and digested with NheI to produce pGL3-Basic-ATF5-5′-UTRα-IF. The CMV promoter/enhancer fragment was inserted into pGL3-Basic-ATF5-5′-UTRα-IF, which was digested with MluI and NheI to produce pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC-IF. The above procedure was applied to pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRαmt1-LUC-IF, pCMV-hATF5-5′UTRαmt2-LUC-IF, and pCMV-hATF5-5′UTRαmt3-LUC-IF. The cloning led to fusion between the ATF5 uORF2 stop codon and the ATG codon of the luciferase coding sequence to produce uORF2 and luciferase fusion proteins. uORF and uORF uAUG(–) expression vectors were constructed by deletion of the luciferase coding region of pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC and pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRαmt3-LUC. Each construct was digested with MscI/XbaI, blunted with T4DNA polymerase, and self-ligated to produce pCMV-uORF and pCMV-uORF-AUG(–). As a carrier plasmid that did not contain the uORF and luciferase sequences, the luciferase sequence was removed from pGL3-CMV by digesting the plasmid with NheI/XbaI, blunted with T4DNA polymerase, and self-ligated to produce pGL3-CMV(LUC–). Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI), and pSV-β-gal (GE Healthcare) were used as internal controls for beetle luciferase expression. Human HRI cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA from HepG2 cells as a template. The primers used were hHRI-F, 5′-CGCGAATTCTATGCAGGGGGGCAACTCC-3′, and hHRI-R, 5′-CCACTGGCGGCCGCTCATCCCACGCCCCCATC-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI. The resultant human HRI coding region of the cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3.1-FLAG vector (8Watatani Y. Kimura N. Shimizu Y.I. Akiyama I. Tonaki D. Hirose H. Takahashi S. Takahashi Y. Life Sci. 2007; 80: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which was digested with EcoRI and NotI to produce pcDNA3.1-FLAG-hHRI. Expression plasmids for eIF2α S51A and eIF2α S51D were kindly provided by D. Ron (New York University, School of Medicine, New York). Preparation of RNA and Quantification of Transcripts—Total RNA was isolated from cells using a GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma). Five μg of total RNA was treated with 3 units of DNase I (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Reverse transcription using 0.5 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA and (dT)12–18 primers (GE Healthcare) was performed with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse-transcribed first strand cDNA was quantified with a real time quantitative PCR system, the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system, or ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system, using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). The following oligonucleotides were used for the amplification of 80-, 147-, or 103-bp fragments of the cDNA corresponding to beetle luciferase, Renilla luciferase, or β-galactosidase: beetle luciferase primers, 5′-ACAAGGATGGATGGCTAC-3′ and 5′-CTTCAGGCGGTCAACGAT-3′; Renilla luciferase primers, 5′-ATGGGATGAATGGCCTGATA-3′ and 5′-GCTGCAAATTCTTCTGGTTCT-3′; and β-galactosidase primers, 5′-GCTGCATAAACCGACTACACAAA-3′ and 5′-GCCGCACATCTGAACTTCAG-3′. For the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system, the samples were first heated at 50 °C for 2 min and then at 95 °C for 10 min and amplified during 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. For the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system, the samples were first heated at 50 °C for 2 min and then at 97 °C for 10 min and amplified during 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The relative luciferase mRNA level was obtained as the ratio of beetle luciferase mRNA to Renilla luciferase mRNA or beetle luciferase mRNA to β-galactosidase mRNA. All values are the mean ± S.E. calculated from the results of three independent experiments. Luciferase Assay—Cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The cell lysates were used to determine luciferase activity with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and Lumat LB 9501 (EG and G Berthold, Badwildbad, Germany). Luciferase activities were normalized with sea pansy luciferase activity. All values are the mean ± S.E. calculated from the results of three independent experiments. Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 70 mm urea, 2% SDS, and 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% for in-frame fusion proteins and 10% for the others) and electrophoretically transferred onto a Trans-Blot transfer membrane or Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a wet transfer system or a semi-dry transfer system. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a 5% nonfat milk solution in TTBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with various antisera, including an anti-luciferase antibody (1:1000), an anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:5000) (Promega, Madison, WI), an anti-FLAG antibody (1:5000) (Sigma), an anti-eIF2α antibody (1:1000), and an anti-phospho-eIF2α antibody (1:1000) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) in TTBS for 40 min at room temperature, then washed three times in TTBS, 2.5% nonfat milk, and incubated with an anti-goat secondary antibody (1:3000), an anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:3000), or an anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:3000) in TTBS, 2.5% nonfat milk for 20 min at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were detected by ECL Western blotting detection regent (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ATF5 5′-UTRα Contains Conserved uORFs—Fig. 1B and Fig. 6A show the 81 and 65% identity between human cDNA and mouse cDNA for ATF5 exon1α and exon1β (19Hansen M.B. Mitchelmore C. Kjærulff K.M. Rasmussen T.E. Pedersen K.M. Jensen N.A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The alignment of the 5′-UTR sequences from human, mouse, and rat ATF5-R1 transcripts reveals a high degree of similarity, and the presence of two additional translation start sites, uAUG1 and uAUG2. The 5′-leader sequence for human ATF5-R1 is 319 nucleotides in length and contains two uORFs (uORF1 and uORF2) preceding the ATF5 coding region. uORF1 and uORF2 have a Kozak match of A/G at –3 and G at +4 of A(+1)UG, and these uAUGs, as well as the ATF5 initiation codon, are found within a sequence context that allows initiation of translation by ribosomes (20Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 263: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The alignment of the amino acid sequences for the uORFs in these species also shows a high degree of similarity (Fig. 1D). The second uAUG delineates an ORF overlapping 53 nucleotides with the ATF5 ORF. In contrast, the relative positions of the upstream AUG and uORFs from exon1β of human and mouse ATF5 showed no significant similarities. The conservation of these 5′-UTRα uORFs among species suggests that they are functionally important for the regulation of ATF5 expression. These observations led us to focus on the effects of the uAUGs in modulating the translation of the downstream coding sequence. ATF5 5′-UTRα Represses Translation of the Downstream Coding Sequence—We investigated whether ATF5 5′-UTRα can regulate translation of the downstream ORF. 5′-UTRα was cloned upstream of the luciferase reading frame, driven by the CMV promoter/enhancer in an expression vector (pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC) (Fig. 2A). The second uAUG delineates an ORF overlapping 80 nucleotides with the luciferase ORF. The construct was transfected into HeLaS3 cells. Fig. 2B shows that the luciferase activity was repressed when 5′-UTRα was present, whereas the luciferase mRNA level was not repressed. To test the generality of this phenomenon, we analyzed the effect of the 5′-UTR on the luciferase activity of COS7 cells. Translational suppression was also seen in COS7 cells. These results suggest that ATF5 translation is strongly repressed by the 5′-UTRα of the ATF5 transcript, and this translational regulation may be a general phenomenon in different cell lines. Mutations in Upstream AUGs Abolish the Repressor Effect of the 5′-UTRα—To determine the importance of the uAUGs of the 5′-UTRα in regulating ATF5 translation, we constructed a series of plasmids (derived from pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC) containing a point mutation for each uAUG or both. After transfection of these constructions into both HeLaS3 and COS7 cells, cellular extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity and luciferase mRNA level (Fig. 2B). Luciferase activity was up-regulated by mutation of the AUG within the second uAUG (5′-UTRαmt2), whereas mutation of the first uAUG (5′-UTRαmt1) did not result in up-regulation of luciferase activity. Compared with the wild-type leader sequence, mutation of the second uAUG led to increases by 17.5-fold (HeLaS3) or 23.5-fold (COS7) in luciferase activity. When both the first and the second uAUG were mutated (5′-UTRαmt3), the repressor effect was also absent, because the luciferase activity was over the control level. These results show that the repression of luciferase activity because of the presence of the ATF5 5′-UTRα occurs at the translational level and that uAUG2 is strongly involved in this repression. This repression of luciferase expression was also demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). Luciferase protein expression was down-regulated by the ATF5-5′-UTRα, whereas the mRNA levels were similar among all constructs. Translation Initiation at the Upstream ORF—The results described above suggest that the ATF5 uORF sequence is translated after initiation of the uAUG2 codon. To test directly the possibility that the uORF can be translated, we generated a construct in which the ATF5 uORF2 was fused in-frame to the luciferase ORF (pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC-IF) (Fig. 3A) and transiently transfected into cultured cells. Transfected cell extracts were purified and analyzed for luciferase expression by Western blotting using a specific antibody that recognizes luciferase. As a control β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pSV-β-gal was co-transfected, and β-galactosidase protein was also detected using a specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B (lane 2), uORF2-LUC fusion protein was expressed at a similar level to the luciferase protein expressed from the correct AUG. As expected, this protein has a molecular weight slightly higher than that of the luciferase protein. These data demonstrate that uORF2 is efficiently translated. We next addressed the possibility that the uORFs encode peptides that inhibit ATF5 translation of the downstream ORF in trans. The reporter plasmid pCMV-LUC or pCMV-hATF5-5′-UTRα-LUC was transfected together with increasing amounts of an ATF5 uORF expression plasmid encoding the putative uORF peptides (pCMV-uORF) (data not shown). A control experiment was performed by co-transfecting the"
https://openalex.org/W2144816616,"The lateral division of the central amygdala (CeAL) is the target of ascending fibers from the pain-responsive and stress-responsive nuclei in the brainstem. We show that single fiber inputs from the nociceptive pontine parabrachial nucleus onto CeAL neurons form suprathreshold glutamatergic synapses with multiple release sites. Noradrenaline, acting at presynaptic alpha2 receptors, potently inhibits this synapse. This inhibition results from a decrease in the number of active release sites with no change in release probability. Introduction of a presynaptic scavenger of Gbetagamma subunits blocked the effects of noradrenaline, and botulinum toxin A reduced its effects, showing a direct action of betagamma subunits on the release machinery. These data illustrate a mechanism of presynaptic modulation where the output of a large multiple-release-site synapse is potently regulated by endogenously released noradrenaline and suggests that the CeA may be a target for the central nociceptive actions of noradrenaline."
https://openalex.org/W2032244100,"Synaptogenesis is a highly regulated process that underlies formation of neural circuitry. Considerable work has demonstrated the capability of some adhesion molecules, such as SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins, to induce synapse formation in vitro. Furthermore, Cdk5 gain of function results in an increased number of synapses in vivo. To gain a better understanding of how Cdk5 might promote synaptogenesis, we investigated potential crosstalk between Cdk5 and the cascade of events mediated by synapse-inducing proteins. One protein recruited to developing terminals by SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins is the MAGUK family member CASK. We found that Cdk5 phosphorylates and regulates CASK distribution to membranes. In the absence of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation, CASK is not recruited to developing synapses and thus fails to interact with essential presynaptic components. Functional consequences include alterations in calcium influx. Mechanistically, Cdk5 regulates the interaction between CASK and liprin-alpha. These results provide a molecular explanation of how Cdk5 can promote synaptogenesis."

The depletion of dopaminergic neurons in PD is thought to result from programmed cell death (13Bredesen D.E. Rao R.V. Mehlen P. Nature. 2006; 443: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), a process that is critical for eliminating cells in development and homeostasis. The most common form of programmed cell death is Type I/apoptosis, which can be triggered through extrinsic and intrinsic cell death pathways (14Buss R.R. Sun W. Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Activation of the intrinsic pathway centers on the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria, including cytochrome c (15Edinger A.L. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c normally shuttles electrons between complexes III and IV in intermembrane space of mitochondria, but once released into the cytoplasm it complexes with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 to form an active apoptosome (16Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Because apoptosome formation quickly leads to executioner caspase activation and apoptosis, the release of cytochrome c is tightly regulated. Pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family facilitate cytochrome c release by causing transient membrane disruptions, referred to as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP; 17Green D.R. Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 97-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Once unrestrained, Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak trigger MOMP. In healthy cells Bax and Bak are blocked by anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (18van Delft M.F. Huang D.C. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Apoptotic stimuli can disrupt these interactions to disinhibit Bax and/or Bak and cause MOMP. Pro-apoptotic BH3-only members of the family bind to anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thereby freeing Bax and Bak to cause MOMP and release cytochrome c. The cytotoxic actions of PQ clearly involve reactive oxygen species (ROS), but its specificity for dopaminergic neurons and possible involvement of the intrinsic cell death pathway are unclear (9Di Monte D.A. Lancet Neurol. 2003; 2: 531-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although positively charged, PQ is actively transported across the blood-brain barrier by the same neutral amino acid transporter used by l-valine and l-dopa (12Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L.

Inside neurons, PQ induces oxidative stress by producing superoxide anions through redox cycling (11McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Dopaminergic neurons may be particularly sensitive to high ROS because of dopamine metabolism that creates hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals, which in turn react with nitric oxide to form highly toxic peroxynitrite (21Bharath S. Hsu M. Kaur D. Rajagopalan S. Andersen J.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). High ROS production stretches metabolic resources as the cell removes misfolded proteins, replaces oxidized lipids, and repairs damaged DNA (22Filomeni G. Ciriolo M.R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 2187-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cells that cannot compensate for this oxidative stress undergo default apoptosis or necrosis under severe conditions, but PQ-treated cells can be protected by superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics (23Peng J.

In the present study, we investigated PQ-induced cell death, which shows morphological and biochemical features that are consistent with apoptosis. PQ induced high levels of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Loss-of-function approaches demonstrated that Bak knockdown protected cells from PQ, and Bak-deficient mice were resistant to PQ neurotoxicity.

Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide, CalceinAM, and TMRE were from Molecular Probes-Invitrogen (Eugene, OR). SK-N-SH Cell LinesParental lines of SK-N-SH were obtained from ATCC maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown and treated in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 10% O2 at 37 °C. Thawed vials of SK-N-SH cells were used for no more than 15 passages. Treatment ConditionsTypically, the cells were plated at 3.4 × 104/cm2 (3.0 × 105/well) in each well of a 6-well plate and grown for 24 h prior to experimental procedures. Cell death was induced by incubation with 200 or 400 μm paraquat/PQ (unless otherwise indicated) for 18 h. When cycloheximide (1 μm) or z-VAD-fmk (50 μm) were used, they were added to media at time 0. Staurosporine was used at 250 nm. Assessment of Cell Viability and ApoptosisTo assay nuclei for apoptotic morphology, the cells were incubated in medium containing 25 μm Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature, and the images were captured using a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescent microscope with a 20× FLUOR objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG 12-bit CCD camera using Image-Pro Software (3–6 images/well). For CalceinAM/propidium iodide viability assay, the cells were incubated in medium containing 5 μm CalceinAM and 100 ng/ml propidium iodide for 15 min at 37 °C, and then the images were captured with a fluorescent video microscope (3–6 images/well). For ΔΨ cells were incubated in medium containing 50 nm TMRE for 20 min at 37 °C and kept on ice until analysis with a BD FACScan. Cytochrome c Release from MitochondriaThe cells were fractionated into cytosolic and heavy membrane fractions, as previously described (27Ethell D.W. Green D.R. LeBlanc A.C. 2nd Ed. Apoptosis Techniques and Protocols. Humana Press, New York2001: 21-34Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250 mm sucrose and homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 22,400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were the cytosolic fraction, and the pellets were mitochondria-rich. The pellets were resuspended in mitochondria buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 10% glycerol and further centrifuged at 22,400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were heavy membrane/mitochondrial fractions. The fractions were separated and immunoblotted with cytochrome c-specific antibody (no. 556433; BD Biosciences). Stable SK/Bcl-2 LinesStable Bcl-2-expressing SK-N-SH lines were made by transfecting SK-N-SH cells with His6-tagged human Bcl-2/pcDNA3 (gift of Dr. Doug Green) using Lipofectamine 2000, followed by selection for G418 resistance. Expression of the transgene was confirmed by immunoblotting whole cell extracts with anti-His antibody (sc-8036; Santa Cruz). ImmunoblottingWhole cells lysates were prepared from treated cells in Laemmli buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were sonicated to disrupt genomic DNA and then boiled in sealed tubes for 5 min. Equal volumes of samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (4–15% gradient gels; Bio-Rad), separated, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Amersham Biosciences) in Tris-glycine-MeOH buffer. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation of the membrane with 1% cold fish gelatin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were probed with primary antibodies specific for actin (A-2066; Sigma) caspase-3 (no. 622701; Biolegend), Bak (no. 556382; BD Biosciences), Bax (no. 556467; BD Biosciences), Bid (no. 550365; BD Biosciences), Bik (no. 557040; BD Biosciences), BNip3 (B7931; Sigma), Mcl-1 (Ms-683-P0; Lab Vision), and Noxa (OP-180; Calbiochem). Primary antibodies were incubated in 1% milk in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, with rocking. The blots were rinsed three times for 15 min with PBST and then incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse An097; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen; and anti-rabbit 611-132-127; Rockland) at 1:1000 in PBST for 45 min at room temperature, with rocking. The bands were detected using an Odyssey scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). RNA Isolation and qPCRThe cells were rinsed with PBS, and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen). One-tenth volume of chloroform was added, and the solutions were mixed by vortex. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase (containing RNA) was extracted and mixed with 1/10 volume of 5 m NaAC (pH 5.2). RNA was precipitated by mixing with equal volumes of isopropanol at room temperature for 30 min. Precipitated RNA was concentrated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g (4 °C) for 30 min and then rinsed with RNase-free 90% EtOH, followed by a second centrifugation. After removal of trace EtOH, the RNA pellet was allowed to air dry for 5–10 min and resuspended in RNase free 10 mm Tris. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry (A260), and 1 μg of total RNA was used for each reverse transcriptase reaction with Superscript III (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers, at 65 °C for 5 min, on ice for 1 min, at 50 °C for 60 min, and at 70 °C for 15 min. Each qPCR contained 1/50th of a single reverse transcription reaction (20 ng of initial template), primers, and qPCR master mix containing SYBR green (Abgene, UK). Primer sets that cross an intronexon boundary were preferentially used to prevent background amplification of genomic DNA. Triplicate reactions for each oligonucleotide primer set were prepared and run simultaneously in a 96-well plate using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system with the following conditions: 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C for 40 cycles. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and actin primers served as internal controls. siRNASmall interfering RNA (siRNA) for human Bak, Bax, and BNip3 were designed with the Whitehead Institute siRNA selection program (28Yuan B.B. Latek R. Hossbach M. Tuschl T. Lewitter F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W130-W133Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The sequences for siRNA were: human BNip3 sense, 5′-GAA GAU GGG CAG AUC AUG UUU; human BNip3 antisense, 5′-ACA UGA UCU GCC CAU CUU CUU; human Bak sense, 5′-CCG ACG CUA UGA CUC AGA CUU; human Bak antisense, 5′-CUC UGA GUC AUA GCG UCG GUU; human Bax sense, 5′-CCG CCU CAC UCA CCA UCU GUU; and human Bax antisense, 5′-UUG GCG GAG UGA GUG GUA GAC. Those siRNA were synthesized at the DNA/RNA Peptide Synthesis Facility in the Beckman Research Institute at the City of Hope Medical Center (Duarte, CA). Noxa siRNA were purchased (sc-37305; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Duplexed siRNA was transfected into SK-N-SH cells with HiPerFect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Knockdown was confirmed with immunoblots, using whole cell lysates. ImmunostainingWild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Hollister, CA). They received two intraperitoneal injections of either saline or 10 mg/kg PQ separated by a 1-week interval and were sacrificed 2 days after the second injection. This time point was chosen because it coincides with the onset of cell loss in the SNpc (46McCormack A.L. Atienza J.G. Johnston L.C. Andersen J.K. Vu S. Di Monte D.A. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The mice were deeply anesthetized and intracardially perfused with heparinized saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. All of the animal studies were done according to National Institutes of Health and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. The brains were excised and cryoprotected by immersion in sucrose solution prior to sectioning on a cryostat. Coronal sections through the entire midbrain were made at 40 μm and stored in preservative at -20 °C until use. Free floating sections were rinsed in PBS and antigen recovered by immersing the sections in 80 °C 10 mm citrate (pH 8.5) for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was then depleted by immersing sections in 3% H2O2 for 10 min and rinsing three times in PBS. The sections were blocked by incubation in 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h, and the sections were incubated with primary antibody in PBST (1% normal goat serum) at 4 °C for 48 h. Primary antibodies used were anti-Noxa (IMG-451 at 1:200; Imgenex), anti-Bak (TC-102 at 1:200; Calbiochem), anti-BNip3 (B7931 at 1:100; Sigma), and anti-TH (T-2928 at 1:800; Sigma). The sections were rinsed three times with PBST for 10 min each, then incubated in appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse BA-9200 or anti-rabbit BA-1000, both from Vector Labs) for 2 h at room temperature, and processed with ABC Vectastain as per the manufacturer's specifications (Vector Labs). The sections were developed with 600 μm diaminobenzidine in PBS for 5–20 min, with 1.5 × 10-3%H2O2. Midbrain sections from six PQ-treated and six saline-treated mice were used for immunostaining. SNpc in each section was traced using a mouse brain stereotaxic atlas as a guide (29McCormack A.L. Di Monte D.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and immuno-positive cells were counted within those boundaries. Cell counts were done for BNip3 on six sections, Noxa on five sections, and Bak on four sections. The statistical significance was established from using Student's t test S.E. Bak Knock-out MiceEight-week old mice that were deficient in Bak (strain B6-129-Bak1tm1Thsn/J) and the appropriate control strain (C57Bl/6J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals received three intraperitoneal injections of either PQ or saline spaced 1 week apart. The mice were sacrificed 1 week after the last injection. A block containing the midbrain was immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C prior to cryoprotection in graded sucrose solutions. The tissue block was snap frozen in cold isopentane and sectioned into 40 μm sections on a cryostat for stereological cell counting. Stereology Cell CountingFor stereological cell counting, a series containing every sixth section throughout the entire substantia nigra was immunostained with an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (1:800; Pel Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) and counterstained with 0.5% Cresyl violet as previously described (11McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 30Gundersen H.J. Jensen E.B. J. Micrsocopy. 1987; 147: 229-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (3042) Google Scholar). The substantia nigra was delineated at low magnification and subsequently sampled at high magnification (StereoInvestigator; MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Stereological estimates were made of both the number of TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra and the total number of nigral neurons using the optical fractionator method to ensure that loss of TH immunoreactivity was due to neuronal loss and not a down-regulation of the marker (11McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The co-efficient of error ranged from 0.07 to 0.09 (19Goldman S.M. Tanner C.M. Oakes D. Bhudhikanok G.S. Gupta A. Langston J.W. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). PQ Induces ApoptosisApoptotic cells usually display a condensed brightly stained nucleus (Fig. 1A). PQ significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in cultures of SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells treated for 18 h (Fig. 1B). This cell death could be blocked by the ribosome inhibitor cycloheximide or the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Another feature of apoptotic cells is the activation of caspase 3 and the cleavage of caspase substrates such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and both occurred in PQ-treated cells (Fig. 1C). These findings were consistent over three separate experiments and in studies involving longer time points (not shown). A key step in the intrinsic cell death pathway is the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Subcellular fractionation showed dose-dependent increases of cytochrome c in cytosolic extracts, indicative of release (Fig. 1D). Cytochrome c release in response to PQ could be blocked by cycloheximide, but not z-VAD-fmk, indicating caspase-independent release. Together, these findings demonstrate that PQ neurotoxicity induces typical apoptosis, which requires new protein synthesis and caspase activity. To determine whether cycloheximide and z-VAD-fmk blocked cell death and not simply the appearance of apoptotic nuclei, we also evaluated cells for viability using calceinAM (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1) and YOPRO3 (supplemental Fig. S1) assays. Cultures treated with PQ showed a significantly lower percentage of viable cells compared with controls. Cycloheximide and z-VAD-fmk provided significant protection against PQ-induced death, at least until the time of assay. To determine whether MOMP may be relevant for PQ-induced apoptosis, we generated SK-N-SH cell lines that stably express anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (supplemental Fig. S1). SK/Bcl-2 clones were highly resistant to PQ neurotoxicity (Fig. 2A). The resistance of SK/Bcl-2 clones to PQ was consistent over three experiments. These findings establish that PQ-induced apoptosis can be blocked by at least one anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, suggesting that the mechanism may involve MOMP. To confirm that PQ-induced cell death is apoptotic, as opposed to necrotic or caspase-independent, we evaluated inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) using the fluorescent tracer TMRE. During necrotic cell death, permeability transitions cause the matrix to swell and burst, disrupting ΔΨ and releasing cytochrome c simultaneously. In contrast, during apoptosis, the structural integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane is maintained through MOMP and cytochrome c release, until active caspases cleave critical proteins and dissipate ΔΨ (31Waterhouse N.J. Goldstein J.C. von Ahsen O. Schuler M. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). FACS analysis of TMRE stained SK-N-SH cells showed that PQ reduced the percentage of cells with ΔΨ, compared with controls (Fig. 2B), and that this effect could be blocked by cycloheximide or by Bcl-2 overexpression in SK/Bcl2 cells. Significantly, z-VAD-fmk prevented the loss of ΔΨ in cells treated with PQ (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that PQ neurotoxicity does not directly disrupt inner mitochondrial membrane integrity but that loss of ΔΨ is a downstream, caspase-dependent process. Cycloheximide-mediated protection established that PQ neurotoxicity requires new protein synthesis that may include pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. We evaluated expression patterns of key Bcl-2 family members using qPCR and immunoblots. Bak and Bax are key players in MOMP as bak-/-/bax-/- cells are resistant to DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and many other apoptotic stimuli (32Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T.

Interestingly, PQ did not induce bax mRNA (Fig. 3A) or Bax protein (Fig. 3B). Bak is constitutively localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it is inhibited by Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 (34Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 35Willis S.N. Fletcher J.I. Kaufmann T. van Delft M.F. Chen L. Czabotar P.E. Ierino H. Lee E.F. Fairlie W.D. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Kluck R.M. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Science. 2007; 315: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). PQ induced bcl-xL and bfl-1/A1 expression (Fig. 3A) but not mcl-1. Protein levels of Bcl-xL and Bfl-1 were also higher (Fig. 3B). Anti-apoptotic members use direct binding to prevent Bak and Bax from causing MOMP and permitting cytochrome c release. This inhibition can be disrupted by BH3-only members that bind to anti-apoptotic members, freeing Bak and Bax to cause MOMP. PQ induced the BH3-only members bnip3, noxa, and bid (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, BNip3 and Noxa bind to Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, respectively, two important inhibitors of Bak. BNip3 (1.6x) and Noxa (2.5x) protein levels were also higher after PQ treatment. Full-length Bid is cytoplasmic until cleaved by caspases-8, -10, or -2 to form tBID, which then translocates to mitochondria and facilitates both Bak and Bax activation. Although PQ potently induced Bid expression in SK-N-SH cells, it is noteworthy that SH-SY5Y cells, the parental line of SK-N-SH cells, do not express caspase-8 because of DNA methylation (36Eggert A.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PQ induces the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bak and two of its activators,"

Modlin R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 297-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and in normal catabolism, it is continuously released in the serum and cleared from the circulation by the kidney. The replacement of renal function by hemodialysis does not efficiently remove β2-m. The persistent increase of its plasma concentration is associated with β2-m deposition in the osteotendineous system, which is the specific target tissue of this type of amyloidosis. Among extra-cerebral amyloidoses, DRA represents the most striking case of tissue-specific targeting. Although other organs can be involved, bones and ligaments never escape amyloid deposition. Homma (2Homma N. Nephron. 1989; 53: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) first pointed out that collagen might be involved in determining this tissue specificity and demonstrated a collagen/β2-m interaction. dialysis-related amyloidosis β2-microglobulin form of β2-m lacking the first six N-terminal residues glycosaminoglycan dialysis-related amyloidosis atomic force microscopy matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. We have recently determined the binding properties governing the collagen/β2-m interaction, and we found that the latter is quite weak but is enhanced when β2-m is truncated at the N-terminal end, and the pH is reduced from 7.4 to 6.4 (3Giorgetti S. Rossi A. Mangione P. Raimondi S. Marini S. Stoppini M. Corazza A. Viglino P. Esposito G. Cetta G. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We subsequently demonstrated that fibrillar collagen (type I), which is abundant in skeletal tissues, is a potent promoter of β2-m fibrillation at 37 °C and pH 6.4 (4Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Rossi A. Fogolari F. Corazza A. Esposito G. Gliozzi A. Bellotti V. J. Biol.

Incubation of β2-m in the presence of fibrillar collagen yielded amyloid fibrils, the morphology of which was similar to that of ex vivo fibrils extracted from the amyloid deposits of patients affected by DRA. We hypothesized that the positively charged patches distributed over the collagen surface could promote an increase of β2-m concentration in the solvent surrounding the collagen fiber and also the proper orientation of β2-m that facilitates an ordered polymerization (4Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Rossi A. Fogolari F. Corazza A. Esposito G. Gliozzi A. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16521-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Type I collagen must assume its highly ordered fiber conformation, typical of bones and ligaments, to promote amyloid formation and deposition. When microfibrils alignment is more disordered, as in the skin (5Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar), collagen, although very abundant in this district, does not represent a good inducer of amyloid fibril deposition. In fact, cutaneous amyloidosis is rare in DRA, although a few cases have been reported (6Miyata T. Nakano T. Masuzawa M. Katsuoka K. Kamata K. J. Dermatol. 2005; 32: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a constitutive component (7Lindahl U. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 98: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) of amyloid deposits, including those associated with DRA. In vitro studies have shown that GAGs enhance the nucleation of amyloid-β peptides (8McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and favor fibril formation and stabilization (9Castillo G.M. Lukito W. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Heparin and at a lesser extent heparan sulfate are reported to significantly increase the rate of fibrillation of α-synuclein (10Cohlberg J.A. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and gelsolin (11Suk J.Y. Zhang F. Balch W.E. Linhardt R.J. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2234-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Extensive experimental evidence show that among GAGs, heparin is particularly effective in accelerating both the fibril formation (11Suk J.Y. Zhang F. Balch W.E. Linhardt R.J. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2234-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and extension (12Yamamoto S. Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Tsutsumi Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that such behavior is highly dependent on the sulfate groups present in this GAG (11Suk J.Y. Zhang F. Balch W.E. Linhardt R.J. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2234-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the enhancement of aggregation by heparin and other GAGs are still unknown. Furthermore, in vivo studies have demonstrated the coincident deposition of amyloidogenic protein and GAGs (13Snow A.D. Kisilevsky R. Lab. Investig. 1985; 53: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar), and in a mouse model of amyloid protein A (AA) amyloidosis a resistance against the amyloid deposition can be achieved through the overexpression of heparanase, which degrades heparan sulfate (14Li J.P.

A key role of GAGs in causing the amyloid deposition is also proved by the effectiveness of therapeutic agents able to displace GAGs from the amyloid fibrils (15Kisilevsky R. Lemieux L.J. Fraser P.E. Kong X. Hultin P.G. Szarek W.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The investigation of the effects of heparin on the fibrillation of β2-m is particularly relevant because heparin is commonly used as an anticoagulant in the therapeutic treatment of patients affected by DRA (16Ikizler T.A. Schulman G. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2005; 46: 976-981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Heparin has been reported to inhibit the depolymerization of β2-m fibrils in vitro (17Yamaguchi I. Suda H. Tsuzuike N. Seto K. Seki M. Yamaguchi Y. Hasegawa K. Takahashi N. Yamamoto S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1080-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and to promote the extension of preformed fibril seeds, both in the presence (12Yamamoto S. Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Tsutsumi Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and in the absence (18Myers S.L. Jones S. Jahn T.R. Morten I.J. Tennent G.A. Hewitt E.W. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2311-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), of trifluoroethanol. Finally, the exposure of heparin to ΔN6β2-m, which is an ubiquitous constituent of the natural β2-m fibrils, allows the formation of amyloid fibrils even in physiologic buffer (19Borysik A.J. Morten I.J. Radford S.E. Hewitt E.W. Kidney Int. 2007; 72: 174-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study we have tested the effect of the co-presence of collagen and heparin on the fibrillogenesis of full-length β2-m. We have mainly used atomic force microscopy to investigate the sample morphology and limited proteolysis to study the conformation of β2-m in the fibrils obtained in the presence of heparin. We performed light scattering measurements to test the effect of heparin on the aggregation process of β2-m. Overall, our data indicate that the enhancing effect of heparin on amyloidogenesis is associated with an increased oligomerization of β2-m. Expression and Purification of Recombinant β2-m–β2-m was produced as recombinant protein according to the procedure reported previously (20Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein solution was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm by using an extinction coefficient (A1 cm1%) of 16.17. Preparation of Type I Fibrillar Collagen–Type I collagen was purified from calf skin as described previously (3Giorgetti S. Rossi A. Mangione P. Raimondi S. Marini S. Stoppini M. Corazza A. Viglino P. Esposito G. Cetta G. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purity of the collagen was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration of the collagen solutions was determined by the hydroxyproline assay according to Huszar et al. (21Huszar G. Maiocco J. Naftolin F. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fibrillar collagen was prepared by solubilizing purified collagen in 5 mm acetic acid. The solution was diluted 1:1 with a phosphate buffer (0.001 m magnesium chloride, 0.272 m sodium chloride, 0.005 m potassium chloride, 0.003 m potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.016 disodium hydrogen phosphate) pH 7.5 and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Aggregation of β2-m–Lyophilized β2-m was dissolved in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.4, at the concentration of 2 mg/ml and centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 1 h to remove large aggregates. The supernatant was collected and filtered with a 20-nm pore filter; the protein concentration was then determined using a Jasco V-530 spectrophotometer. Aggregation experiments were performed at protein concentrations in the 40–50 μm range for AFM (atomic force microscopy) experiments and 160–170 μm range for thioflavin T assay, after acidification of the protein solution to pH 6.4 by using an HCl solution at pH 2. The final ammonium acetate concentration was in the 12–30 mm range. 20 μg of fibrillar collagen were suspended in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.4 and were added to the protein solution. The sample was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 20 μm heparin sodium salt, low molecular weight (4000–6000) from porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma-Aldrich). Furthermore, the same experimental conditions were used for the aggregation experiments in the presence of 1 mg/ml of ΔN6β2-m. Thioflavin T Assay–Quantification of amyloid fibril formation was performed with the method described by LeVine (22LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T concentration was 5 μm, and the buffer used was 50 mm glycine, pH 8.5. Measurements were made using a LS50 PerkinElmer spectrofluorometer with excitation at 455 nm; emission was collected at 485 nm. Slits were set at 5 mm. Limited Proteolysis and MALDI-TOF Experiments–The aggregate constituted by fibrillar β2-m grown on collagen in the presence of heparin was separated from the supernatant and washed twice with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Comparative limited proteolysis experiments were performed on soluble β2-m and fibrils obtained from β2-m at pH 4.0 (20Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and at pH 6.4 in the presence of collagen and heparin. Experiments were carried out by incubating the samples with trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) and endoprotease AspN (Roche). Enzymatic digestions were all performed in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.5) at 37 °C using an enzyme-to-substrate ratio 1:100 (w/w). The extent of the reaction was monitored on a time course basis by sampling the incubation mixture at different time intervals. Peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Micromass spectrometer (Waters) in linear mode. The sample was solubilized in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, and the protein solution was mixed 1:1 with a solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid, 10 mg/ml in acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid 7:3 (v:v), applied onto the metallic sample plate and air dried. Mass calibration was performed using a sample of β2-m soluble standard. Atomic Force Microscopy–Aggregation of β2-m in the presence of collagen and heparin was performed as described above, but a lower heparin concentration was employed (from 2 to 9 μm). The protein concentration was in the range between 17 and 50 μm. In addition, four or five aliquots of fibrillar collagen (instead of one) were added to the protein solution to allow sampling at different times of the aggregation reaction. Details of sample preparation, including pre-sonication of collagen, are the same described previously for aggregation experiments in the presence of collagen alone (4Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Rossi A. Fogolari F. Corazza A. Esposito G. Gliozzi A. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16521-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For AFM inspection, each collagen aliquot was extracted from the protein solution, deposited onto freshly cleaved mica, gently washed with buffer, and dried under a nitrogen stream. AFM images were acquired in tapping mode using a Multimode Scanning Probe microscope (Digital Instruments-Veeco, Santa Barbara, California), equipped with a “E” scanning head (maximum scan size 10 μm), and driven by a Nanoscope IV controller. Single beam uncoated silicon cantilevers (type OMCL-AC160TS, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were used. The drive frequency was around 300 kHz; the scan rate was between 0.3 and 0.8 Hz. Vertical displacements were calibrated measuring the depth of grating notches (180 nm) and the half-unit cell steps (1 nm) obtained by treating freshly cleaved mica with hydrofluoric acid. The horizontal displacements of the piezoelectric tubes were calibrated using a 3-μm pitch diffraction grating. Dynamic Light Scattering–Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments). This instrument exploits backscatter detection (173 °C) together with non-invasive detection optics (NIBS technology) and yields size distributions obtained by the analysis of the correlation function using an algorithm based on CONTIN. The latter uses the following power approximation for the scattered intensity: I(r) ∼ r6, r < 100 nm; I(r) ∼ r2, r ≥ 100 nm (23Khlebtsov N.G. Colloid J. 2003; 65: 652-655Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, due to the high polydispersity of our system, such analysis only provides a qualitative estimate of the size distributions. Therefore, we chose to base the analysis of dynamic light scattering data on the comparison of the auto-correlation functions in the absence and in the presence of heparin. Experiments were performed incubating β2-m at 37 °C in ammonium acetate 50 mm, pH 6.4. A set of experiments was also performed under the same conditions, but at pH 7.4. The protein concentration was between 260 and 300 μm. We tested heparin concentrations of 2 and 0.6 μm. Before starting the experiment, the protein solution was filtered with a 20-nm pore filter, and the protein concentration was determined after filtration using a Jasco V-530 spectrophotometer. The pH stability of the sample was checked as a function of time; the measurements at pH 7.4 were done under nitrogen to avoid possible pH changes induced in the small sample volume by the presence of atmospheric CO2. Cross-linkage of β2-m Oligomers–β2-m at 100 μm in phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) was incubated with 200 μm disuccinimidyl glutarate, used as a cross-linker (freshly prepared in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions), at room temperature for 30 min. This condition represents a cross-linker to protein ratio of 2:1. The reaction was quenched with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). An aliquot of the cross-linked protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (24Laemmli K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207530) Google Scholar), and the spots corresponding to monomeric and dimeric species were excised from the gel, washed in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, in 50% acetonitrile, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 56 °C for 45 min, and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The gel pieces were washed several times with the buffer, resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and incubated with 200 ng of endoprotease AspN (ROCHE) overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant containing peptides was analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in reflection mode. Mass calibration was performed using a peptide standard mixture provided by the manufacturer. Subsequently the peptide mixtures obtained by endoprotease AspN digestion were submitted to hydrolysis with 200 ng of trypsin (Sigma) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. To test the effect of heparin on the aggregation of β2-m under pathophysiological conditions, we incubated β2-m at 37 °C and pH 6.4 in the presence of type I fibrillar collagen and heparin. The aggregation process was investigated as a function of the incubation time by tapping mode atomic force microscopy. In a previous study (4Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Rossi A. Fogolari F. Corazza A. Esposito G. Gliozzi A. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16521-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that β2-m fibrillation under these conditions is strictly localized and associated with the presence of the collagen surface. In the absence of collagen, aggregation experiments performed in the presence of heparin did not give rise to fibril formation. By contrast, in the presence of collagen and heparin, the formation of thin filaments around 1 nm in diameter was observed already after 17-h incubation (Fig. 1a), whereas after 24 h fibrils were formed. Fig. 1b shows a network of fibrils connecting two isolated collagen fibers, which can easily be recognized due to the characteristic-banding pattern of collagen. A third collagen fibril, shorter and thinner than the other ones and also surrounded by β2-m fibrils, is visible in the upper left part of the image; non-fibrillar aggregates are also present. At 48 h fibrils were arranged into planar bundles (Fig. 2a). By contrast, under the same conditions but in the absence of heparin, fibrils were still absent, as shown in Fig. 2b, which displayed a typical pattern obtained in this case. Several collagen fibers of different diameters are visible; the banding pattern is hidden by the presence of proteinaceous material completely surrounding collagen. The inset shows a magnification of the protein material in the background of Fig. 2b, which does not exhibit yet any fibrillar arrangement, whereas annular protofibrils are occasionally observed.FIGURE 2Tapping-mode-AFM images of β2-m incubated at 37 °C and pH 6. 4 in the presence of fibrillar collagen (a and c, with 9 μm heparin; b and d, without heparin) (see under “Results”).

Fig. 2c shows the typical close-packed arrangement of fibrils in planar sheets, as observed previously for ex vivo β2-m amyloid fibrils purified from patients affected by dialysis-related amyloidosis (4Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Rossi A. Fogolari F. Corazza A. Esposito G. Gliozzi A. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16521-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fibrils originated from collagen fibers, which clearly exhibited their banding pattern. Clumps of non-fibrillar material were also present in this sample. In the absence of heparin, fibrils were observed after 4 days incubation (Fig. 2d, inset), whereas larger fibril bundles were found after 9 days (d). The heights of fibrils obtained in the presence and in the absence of heparin were 2.3 ± 0.4 and 2.0 ± 0.4 nm, respectively. Within the experimental error, these values are compatible and are in agreement with those measured for ex vivo β2-m amyloid fibrils (4Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S.

Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A closer inspection of the early stages of the aggregation process in the presence of collagen and heparin is reported in Fig. 3. At the start of the aggregation, globular material was observed (Fig. 3a). These globules had a height of 0.80 ± 0.03 nm and an apparent width of 32 ± 1 nm (the latter is influenced by the tip size). After 2 h this material appeared in part organized into small clusters (Fig. 3b); a statistical analysis of the aggregate sizes yielded a height of 0.95 ± 0.05 nm and an apparent width of 40 ± 2 nm. After 4 h short protofibrils, in some cases organized into rings, were observed (Fig. 3c). The protofibril height was 0.93 ± 0.02 nm, whereas the length was 92 ± 3 nm. The sample texture observed after 4 h resembles that in the background of Fig. 1a, corresponding to 17 h of aggregation, although in the latter a much larger number of rings are visible and longer, straight filaments are also present. For an easier comparison, a portion of Fig. 1a is reported in Fig. 3d at the same scale of Fig. 3, a–c. Although collagen fibers were not always visible in the images presented here, all images were obtained by engaging the AFM tip in close proximity to the collagen network. The filament and fibril sizes reported above were obtained from the height in cross-section of the topographic AFM images; these sizes were reduced with respect to fully hydrated conditions due to the drying procedure applied to the sample to facilitate its adhesion to the mica substrate. A correction factor of about 1.4 was determined based on measurements of the height of globular proteins under full hydration conditions and after drying using a nitrogen stream. 3S. Giannini, G.

We have previously reported that in similar conditions, but without heparin, the thioflavin assay of β2-m was negative. We have now confirmed the previous data, but in the presence of heparin, thioflavin positive aggregates become detectable in solution (Fig. 4). According to the thioflavin assay the fibrillar conversion of full-length β2-m is further accelerated by the presence of ΔN6β2-m at a concentration that per se and within this time course scale does not generate any thioflavin positive aggregate. To test whether the presence of collagen and heparin might affect the arrangement of the polypeptide chain in β2-m fibrils, we employed limited proteolysis, which is an excellent tool to detect the presence of different polypeptide conformations and states of association. Using this technique others and we have shown that the first strand of β2-m becomes flexible and susceptible to proteases when the protein is in the fibrillar state (26Monti M. Principe S.

Ashcroft A.E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 20: 1628-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that trypsin can specifically cleave fibrillar β2-m at the peptide bond between Lys-6 and Ile-7, and this bond is fully protected when β2-m is in the globular state (26Monti M. Principe S. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Merlini G. Clark A. Bellotti V. Amoresano A. Pucci P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have now obtained similar results by monitoring the proteolytic susceptibility of amyloid fibrils grown on collagen in the presence of heparin by using two different enzymes (trypsin and endoprotease AspN). The products obtained exposing the complex collagen-amyloid fibrils to these proteases are substantially identical to those resulting from fibrils formed in vitro at low pH. As an example, the cleavage patterns obtained with trypsin on globular β2-m, on fibrils of β2-m formed in vitro at pH 4.0 and fibrils grown on collagen in the presence of heparin are reported in Fig. 5. It is worth noting that all the cleavage sites described in the past (20Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P.

Here we describe extended male development in a hominin species, Paranthropus robustus . Ranking a large sample of facial remains on the basis of dental wear stages reveals a difference in size and robusticity between young adult and old adult males. Combined with estimates of sexual dimorphism, this pattern suggests that male reproductive strategy focused on monopolizing groups of females, in a manner similar to that of silverback gorillas. However, males appear to have borne a substantial cost in the form of high rates of predation."
https://openalex.org/W2162738875,"Our visual system imposes structure onto images that usually contain a diversity of surfaces, contours, and colors. Psychological theories propose that there are multiple steps in this process that occur in hierarchically organized regions of the cortex: early visual areas register basic features, higher areas bind them into objects, and yet higher areas select the objects that are relevant for behavior. Here we test these theories by recording from the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We demonstrate that the V1 neurons first register the features (at a latency of 48 ms), then segregate figures from the background (after 57 ms), and finally select relevant figures over irrelevant ones (after 137 ms). We conclude that the psychological processing stages map onto distinct time episodes that unfold in the visual cortex after the presentation of a new stimulus, so that area V1 may contribute to all these processing steps."

In higher organisms, the V-ATPase complex can also be found in the plasma membrane of polarized cells involved in acid secretion such as the ruffled membrane of bone osteoclasts or the apical membrane of renal intercalated cells. The vacuolar ATPase is a large, multisubunit complex, which can be divided into a water-soluble ATPase domain and a membrane-bound proton pore. The two domains are termed V1 and V0, respectively, in analogy to the F1 and F0 of the related F1F0-ATP synthase. In yeast, the V1-ATPase domain contains subunits AB(C)DEFGH, whereas the membrane-bound V0 is made of subunits acc′c″de. Much like the F-ATP synthase, the V-ATPase is a rotary molecular motor enzyme (5Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G-H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

The remaining subunits C, E, G, and H are involved in forming a peripheral stator domain that provides a structural link between the catalytic domain (A3B3) and the membrane-bound a subunit. In the related F-ATP synthase, it is now well established that there is a single peripheral stalk, which, in the case of the bacterial enzyme, is formed by two copies of the membrane-anchored b subunits and the δ subunit (7Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The situation in the vacuolar ATPase, however, is more complicated in that there appear to be multiple peripheral stalks that connect the catalytic domain to the membrane-bound a subunit, possibly via the V-ATPase-specific H and C subunits. Using electron microscopy and single particle image analysis, we have previously shown that the C and H subunits are positioned in the interface connecting the V1 and V0, where they are connected to the A3B3 domain via elongated protein densities bound at the periphery of the B subunits (8Wilkens S.

However, based on electron microscopic images of the intact V-ATPase and the isolated V1-ATPase domain, we had speculated earlier that the number of peripheral stalks might be three as, especially in images of the intact V-ATPase, each of the three B subunits seemed to have an elongated protein density bound at its periphery (8Wilkens S.

During dissociation, the interaction between soluble and membrane domains involving the peripheral stalks has to be broken, and as a result of that process, subunit C dissociates from the separated V1 and V0 (18Curtis K.K. Francis S.A. Oluwatosin Y. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8979-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To be able to understand the structural mechanism of enzyme dissociation, knowledge of the number of peripheral stalks and the nature of their interaction with the other subunits of the stalk domain and the complex are essential. We therefore decided to determine the copy number of the E and G subunits in the yeast V1-ATPase by two different mass spectrometry approaches. First, native electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to obtain a measurement of the molecular mass of the intact V1-ATPase complex that was accurate enough so that the subunit stoichiometry could be deduced. Second, we used known amounts of isotope-labeled subunits as internal standards to directly determine the copy number of subunits E and G in yeast V1. Results from both approaches were in excellent agreement and indicated that yeast V1-ATPase complex contains three copies each of the E and G subunits. Based on this result and our earlier electron microscopy images, we propose a structural model of the complex in which three peripheral stalks, via interaction with C, H, and a subunits, connect the V1 and V0 domains in intact yeast vacuolar ATPase. Yeast V1-ATPase PurificationV1-ATPase was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SF838-5Aα vma10Δ::kanMX expressing a FLAG-tagged VMA10 in plasmid pRS315 (CEN6, LEU2) as described previously (19Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, one colony of the FLAG-Vma10p yeast strain was transferred into 5 ml of liquid SD leucine-dropout medium. The inoculum volume was gradually increased to 250 ml and then transferred into 8 liters of YPD in a fermenter (Electrolab). Yeast was grown to an A600 of 4-5 and harvested via low speed centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 1:1 w/v and frozen overnight at -20 °C. Frozen cell pellet was thawed in room temperature water, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 mm dithiothreitol were added. Cells were lysed with 10 passes through a M110-L Microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp.) cell disruptor. An additional 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added after the final pass. Crude lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 250,000 × g, 4 °C, and the supernatant was passed over a 5-ml anti-FLAG M2 column (Sigma). The column was washed with 30 column volumes (CV) of TBS and eluted in 3 CV of TBS containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. V1-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated down to 1 ml and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR 16/50 gel filtration column attached to an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Gel filtration was performed in TBS at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. V1-containing fractions were pooled and frozen in aliquots in liquid N2 for storage. Cloning of Yeast V-ATPase Subunits E and GAn Escherichia coli E subunit expression construct was generated as a fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP) by subcloning the wild-type VMA4 open reading frame (minus the N-terminal Met) from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA into a pMAL-c2e vector (New England Biolabs) with a PreScission protease cleavage site in place of the stock enterokinase site, using the following primers: pM4, forward, 5′-GACAAGGTACCGTCCTCCGCTATTACTGCTTTTGAC-3′, and pM4, reverse, 5′-GTGCCAAGCTTCAATCAAAGAACTTTCTTGTCTTG-3′. Forward and reverse primers contained KpnI and HindIII digest sites, respectively. The resulting MBP fusion construct, pM4, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pM4 construct was transformed into Rosetta 2 E. coli cells (Novagen) and plated on LB agar containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. An E. coli FLAG-tagged G subunit expression construct was generated by subcloning the FLAG-tagged VMA10 open reading frame from the previously described pRS315 construct (19Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) into the first multiple cloning site of a pET-Duet-1 vector (Novagen), using the following primers: pDuet1G, forward, 5′-GATATACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGA-3′, and pDuet1G, reverse, 5′-CATTATGCGGCCGCTTACAAGGCATTGATATGGACTTCAG-3′. Forward and reverse primers contained NcoI and NotI digest sites, respectively. The resulting construct, pG, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pG construct was transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen) and plated on LB agar containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Protein Expression and PurificationSingle colonies of pM4-expressing cells were picked and grown overnight at 37 °C in a 25-ml inoculum of LB containing antibiotics. The entire 25 ml was used to inoculate 1 liter of M9 medium containing 1 g of [15N]ammonium chloride (Spectra Stable Isotopes). 1 liter of culture was grown at 37 °C to an A595 = 0.6, at which point the temperature was lowered to 16 °C. After 1 h, culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in Column Buffer (20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7) up to a final volume of 25 ml, and frozen overnight at -20 °C. Frozen cell pellet was thawed in room temperature water and treated with 1 μg/ml lysozyme and 10 μg/ml DNase I for 30′ on ice with gentle, intermittent shaking. Cells were sonicated for three cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off at 50% power using a Virtis VirSonic 100 sonicator and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g to clarify lysate. Lysate was diluted 1:5 in Column Buffer and applied to a 20-ml amylose resin column (New England Biolabs) at ∼1 ml/min, washed with 30 CV of Column Buffer, and then eluted in 1.5 CV of Column Buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Fractions containing MBP fusion protein were dialyzed in DEAE binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8) overnight at 4 °C. MBP fusion was then passed over a 5-ml DEAE column, washed with 10 CV of DEAE binding buffer, and then eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 100 mm NaCl over 40 CV. Fractions containing clean fusion protein were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 1 ml using Vivaspin 20 concentrator columns with a 50-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Fusion protein was then digested using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) and 5 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 4 °C. E subunit was separated from MBP by gel filtration (Superdex 75 HR 16/50) in TBS. E subunit-containing fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and stored in liquid N2. For purification of subunit G, single colonies of pG-expressing cells were picked and grown overnight at 37 °C in a 25-ml inoculum of LB containing antibiotics. The entire 25 ml was used to inoculate 1 liter of M9 medium containing 1 g of [15N]ammonium chloride (Spectra Stable Isotopes). 1 liter of culture was grown at 37 °C to an A595 = 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells lysate was prepared as above, diluted 1:5 in TBS, and applied to a 5-ml anti-FLAG M2 column at ∼1 ml/min. The column was washed with 30 CV of TBS and eluted in 3 CV of TBS containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. G subunit-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 1 ml, and subjected to gel filtration as above. Purified G subunit-containing fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and stored in liquid N2. Protein Concentration DeterminationProtein concentrations were routinely estimated by measuring UV absorbance in 6 m guanidine-HCl (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). For more accurate concentration determination, three samples each of V1 and individual E and G subunits were subjected to quantitative amino acid analysis (University of Texas Medical Branch). Electrospray Ionization Mass SpectrometryV1-ATPase sample was subjected to buffer exchange to 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, by using an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter device with a cut-off of 10,000 Da (Millipore, Bedford). The sample was sprayed from solution of 2 μl containing ∼0.5 μm (∼0.3 mg/ml). The macromolecular mass spectrometry measurements were performed in positive ion mode using first generation modified Q-TOF 1 and LCT instruments (Micromass, Manchester, UK) (21van den Heuvel R.H. van Duijn E. Mazon H. Synowsky S.A. Lorenzen K. Versluis C. Brouns S.J. Langridge D. van der Oost J. Hoyes J. Heck A.J. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 7473-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 22Lorenzen K.

To detect intact gas-phase ions from large protein complexes, it is generally required to cool the ions collisionally by increasing the pressure in the first vacuum stages of the mass spectrometer (23Tahallah N. Pinkse M. Maier C.S. Heck A.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Chernushevich I.V. Thomson B.A. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1754-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The pressures were optimized to balance preservation of noncovalent interactions and promote efficient ion desolvation in the interface region of the instrument. In this way, we were able to attain sharp ion signals enabling confident accurate mass determination, and consequently, the stoichiometry of the V1-ATPase complexes from the mass spectra. Furthermore, nanoelectrospray voltages were optimized for generation of the macromolecular protein complexes; the needle voltage was 1,500 V, and the sample cone voltage was 150 V. Mass Spectrometry of Individual Subunits of the V1-ATPaseV1-ATPase was denatured by diluting in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid at a concentration of ∼0.5 μm. Mass measurements were performed in positive ion mode using an electrospray ionization time-of-flight instrument LCT (Micromass, Manchester, UK) essentially as described previously (22Lorenzen K. Versluis C. van Duijn E. van den Heuvel R. H.H. Heck A. J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 268: 198-206Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Isotope-labeled Subunit Titration and MALDI-Mass SpectrometryIncreasing amounts of 15N-labeled E and G subunits were mixed with a determined amount of yeast V1-ATPase, and the resulting protein mixture was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Bands containing both unlabeled and 15N-labeled E and G subunits were excised from the gels with a clean razor blade. Gel bands were diced into cubes of <1 mm3, washed three times in 400 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, 50% acetonitrile, shrunk in 100 μl of 100% acetonitrile, and dried for 30 min in a SpeedVac with heating. 25 μl of trypsin was added to the dried gel slices, and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the swelled gel slices. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube, and the remaining gel slices were extracted twice with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O for 15 min at room temperature. The combined extracts were dried for 1 h in a SpeedVac with heating. Dried peptide pellets were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, purified with a ZipTip, and then pipetted onto a stainless steel MALDI probe at 1:4 and 1:10 dilutions in a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fluka) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide samples were analyzed using a first generation Bruker Autoflex MALDI-TOF. Raw mass spectra were exported to CSV files using open source mMass software and processed using in-house scripts written in Ruby. Baseline was calculated as described previously (25Gras R. Müller M. Gasteiger E. Gay S. Binz P.A. Bienvenut W. Hoogland C. Sanchez J.C. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3535-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Raw spectra were divided into 40-Da windows (si), within which both median (simed) and fifth percentile (silow) signal intensity values were calculated. Noise was defined as ni = 2(simed - silow) for a given window si. The local noise envelope for a given window si was defined as simed ± ni. The signal trend and noise envelope were calculated by cubic spline interpolation (26Gough B. 2nd Ed. GNU Scientific Library Reference Manual. Network Theory Ltd., Bristol, UK2006Google Scholar) of the si data points. The noise floor, or simed - ni, was subtracted from the intensity value of each data point to provide a baseline correction. The noise ceiling, or simed + ni, was used as a threshold to accept or reject peaks. The width of each isotopic envelope was defined as the maximum width that completely contained all peaks above the noise threshold. An isotopic envelope was rejected if the envelope was perturbed by noise or overlapping signal from other peptides. Mass spectra were obtained from digests of three gels each for E + V1 and G + V1 at various ratios. 4-8 peak pair ratios from validated pairs of isotopic envelopes were averaged together for each titration point for the G and E subunit, respectively. A 1:1 peak ratio of 14N- and 15N-containing peptides was interpolated using the least squares linear regression analysis. V1-ATPase Subunit Stoichiometry by Native Mass SpectrometryThe gentle nature of electrospray ionization and the spectacular advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation enable the direct analysis of large intact macromolecular protein complexes. This field, nowadays termed macromolecular or native mass spectrometry, focuses on the structural and functional analysis of the dynamics and interactions occurring in protein complexes. For this method, the sample of interest is electrosprayed from an aqueous solution of a volatile buffer such as ammonium acetate. Desolvation of the protein assemblies in the ion source interface generates multiply charged ions of the intact complexes that can be analyzed by the mass spectrometer. Native mass spectrometry has been used to obtain accurate information about stoichiometry, stability, and dynamics of protein complexes (21van den Heuvel R.H. van Duijn E. Mazon H. Synowsky S.A.

Here, we applied macromolecular mass spectrometry to investigate the composition of V1-ATPase from the yeast S. cerevisiae. Before the analysis of V1-ATPase under pseudophysiological native solvent conditions, we first analyzed the complex under denaturing solvent conditions. From the resulting mass spectra, we were able to determine the accurate masses of each subunit present in the complex. The obtained subunit masses are given in Table 1, together with the predicted masses of the subunits derived from the gene sequences. The only subunit not detected by this approach was subunit D. The absence of subunit D in the mass spectra might be due to the relatively hydrophobic nature of the polypeptide. On the basis of the gene-predicted amino acid sequences, we concluded that most subunits lacked the N-terminal methionine residue, except subunit G, which in our purifications also contains the N-terminal FLAG tag. For subunits B and H, the masses were very close to the expected masses. For the others, we observed slightly higher experimental masses, with mass increases likely to be related to post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal acetylation (+42 Da).TABLE 1Comparison from theoretical and measured masses of V1-ATPase-associated proteins and the intact- and subunit depleted V1-ATPase complexesExperimental massesTheoretical massesSubunitsMass differencesDaaStandard errors represent the maximum mass error obtained from the full width at half-maximum of the most intense peak for each charge state distributionDaDa67,642.1 ± 28.067,592.5A+49.657,630.5 ± 32.257,618.2B+12.3–29,063.0D–26,387.3 ± 4.526,340.2E+47.113,374.1 ± 1.013,330.2F+43.913,752.4 ± 1.313,707.6GbN-terminal Met + FLAG tag+44.854,298.1 ± 22.154,284.8H+13.3ComplexesNameComposition593,576 ± 3,000592,454IA3B3DE3FG3H+1,122553,544 ± 2,000552,406IIA3B3DE2FG2H+1,138428,305 ± 1,600427,195IIIA2B2DE2FG2H+1,110a Standard errors represent the maximum mass error obtained from the full width at half-maximum of the most intense peak for each charge state distributionb N-terminal Met + FLAG tag Open table in a new tab Next, we investigated V1-ATPase by macromolecular mass spectrometry. Fig. 1 shows a representative native mass spectrum of yeast V1-ATPase obtained from an aqueous solution of the protein in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. The spectrum reveals three individual charge state distributions centered around m/z values of 10,000, 11,400, and 11,500, respectively, with the most abundant distribution around m/z 11,500. The protein mass could be easily determined by using the well resolved multiple charge states of the protein. Thus, mass determination of the ion series with the highest m/z values (around 11,500) yielded a molecular mass of 593,576 ± 3,000 Da (Table 1, complex I). When we sum the theoretical masses of each subunit (i.e. as predicted from the gene sequences) in the stoichiometry A3B3DE3FG3H, we obtain a mass of 592,454 Da, which is a very close match to the observed mass of the complex. This mass is only 0.19% higher than the measured mass for this complex. The observed deviation between the theoretical and experimental mass can be partly explained by the fact that we observed higher experimental masses for each individual subunit under denaturing conditions but also by incomplete desolvation, which may leave several water or buffer molecules attached to the protein complex (29Heck A.J. Van den Heuvel R.H. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2004; 23: 368-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 33Sobott F. McCammon M.G. Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Philos. Transact. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 2005; 363: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). To address the first issue, if we sum the experimental derived masses of the subunits in an A3B3DE3FG3H stoichiometry, we come to a mass of 592,971 Da, a value that is now only off by 0.1%. Therefore, we conclude with high confidence that the subunits A, B, E, and G are present in three copies in this complex I, whereas D, F, and H are only present as a single copy. The second ions series centered around m/z 11,400 had a determined mass of 553,544 ± 2,000 Da (Table 1, complex II). The closest theoretical matching mass is 552,406 Da, corresponding to a complex of A3B3DE2FG2H stoichiometry. Thus, when compared with the most abundant complex I, the complex II lacks one copy of E and one copy of G. The last ion series centered around m/z values of 10,000 had a mass of 428,305 ± 1,600 Da (Table 1, complex III). Here, we can unambiguously assign the mass to a subcomplex of V1-ATPase with a stoichiometry of A2B2DE2FG2H (427,195 Da). Thus, in contrast to complex I, the subunits A, B, E, and G are present only in two copies in the complex III. The zero charge convoluted mass spectrum (Fig. 1, inset) semiquantifies the relative abundance of each complex in our purification. We estimated that in the preparation used for electrospray mass spectrometry, the complexes I, II, and III represented 60, 15, and 25%, respectively. In two other experiments, the estimated ratios were 57/17/26% and 72/12/16% for complexes I, II, and II, respectively (not shown). This indicates some variability in the integrity of the V1-ATPase, possibly due to sample preparation and/or electrospray ionization (see below). Nevertheless, the data show that the majority of V1-ATPase complexes have three copies of E and three copies of G. We also hypothesize from our data that the subunits E and G are strongly correlated, consistent with these two subunits forming a heterodimer because in the complexes I, II, and III, each time the copy numbers for E and G were equal. Only very minor amounts of individual E and G subunits could be seen in the low m/z range in the native mass spectra of yeast V1-ATPase, suggesting that the two subcomplexes II and III were alread"
https://openalex.org/W2169899675,"The organization of neuronal wiring into layers and columns is a common feature of both vertebrate and invertebrate brains. In the Drosophila visual system, each R7 photoreceptor axon projects within a single column to a specific layer of the optic lobe. We refer to the restriction of terminals to single columns as tiling. In a genetic screen based on an R7-dependent behavior, we identified the Activin receptor Baboon and the nuclear import adaptor Importin-α3 as being required to prevent R7 axon terminals from overlapping with the terminals of R7s in neighboring columns. This tiling function requires the Baboon ligand, dActivin, the transcription factor, dSmad2, and retrograde transport from the growth cone to the R7 nucleus. We propose that dActivin is an autocrine signal that restricts R7 growth cone motility, and we demonstrate that it acts in parallel with a paracrine signal that mediates repulsion between R7 terminals."

The regulation of these membrane proteins is still incompletely understood. Using the male reproductive tract as a model system in which water and glycerol transport are critical for the establishment of fertility, we now report a novel pathway for the regulation of aquaporin 9 (AQP9) permeability. AQP9 is the major aquaglyceroporin of the epididymis, liver, and peripheral leukocytes, and its COOH-terminal portion contains a putative PDZ binding motif (SVIM). Here we show that NHERF1, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and AQP9 co-localize in the apical membrane of principal cells of the epididymis and the vas deferens, and that both NHERF1 and CFTR co-immunoprecipitate with AQP9. Overlay assays revealed that AQP9 binds to both the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of NHERF1, with an apparently higher affinity for PDZ1 versus PDZ2. Pull-down assays showed that the AQP9 COOH-terminal SVIM motif is essential for interaction with NHERF1. Functional assays on isolated tubules perfused in vitro showed a high permeability of the apical membrane to glycerol, which is inhibited by the AQP9 inhibitor, phloretin, and is markedly activated by cAMP. The CFTR inhibitors DPC, GlyH-101 and CFTRinh-172 all significantly reduced the cAMP-activated glycerol-induced cell swelling. We propose that CFTR is an important regulator of AQP9 and that the interaction between AQP9, NHERF1, and CFTR may facilitate the activation of AQP9 by cAMP.

Significant water reabsorption leading to a marked increase in sperm concentration and luminal hypertonicity occurs in the epididymis (5Levine N. Marsh D.J. J. Physiol. 1971; 213: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 11Clulow J. Jones R.C. Hansen L.A. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 79: 915-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Turner T.T.

In addition, glycerol, a metabolic substrate for epididymal sperm, is accumulated in the lumen of the distal epididymis (14Cooper T.G. Brooks D.E. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1981; 61: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the more distal regions of the epididymis and in the vas deferens, water secretion driven by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 2The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorCFcystic fibrosisNHERF1Na/H exchanger regulatory factor 1cpt-cAMPchlorophenylthio cAMPIPimmunoprecipitationGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineBBMbrush border membranePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideTBSTris-buffered salineaaamino acid(s)DPCdiphenylcarbamyl chloride. 2The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorCFcystic fibrosisNHERF1Na/H exchanger regulatory factor 1cpt-cAMPchlorophenylthio cAMPIPimmunoprecipitationGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineBBMbrush border membranePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideTBSTris-buffered salineaaamino acid(s)DPCdiphenylcarbamyl chloride.-dependent chloride transport occurs and controls the fluidity of the luminal content (15Wong P.Y.

Although the epididymis is among the most seriously affected organs in cystic fibrosis (CF), very little is known about the mechanisms that lead to the marked decrease in male fertility that occurs in this disease. Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of male infertility (15Wong P.Y. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17van der Ven K. Messer L. van der Ven H.

Androl. 2004; 27: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CFTR plays a critical role in the anatomy and function of the epididymis and vas deferens. A large number of men with CF have no vas deferens, and/or absence or atrophy of some regions of the epididymis (19Anguiano A. Oates R.D. Amos J.A. Dean M. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Maher T.A. White M.B. Milunsky A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1992; 267: 1794-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 20Oates R.D. Amos J.A. J. Androl. 1994; 15: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that these abnormalities were the consequence of defective embryonic development. However, recent studies have indicated that dysfunction of the epididymis and vas deferens in patients with cystic fibrosis might be the results of a progressive atrophy of these tissues that may occur after birth and reach maximum intensity at adult age (21Gaillard D.A. Carre-Pigeon F. Lallemand A. J. Urol. 1997; 158: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Blau H. Freud E. Mussaffi H. Werner M. Konen O. Rathaus V. Arch. Dis. Child. 2002; 87: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that prevention strategies could be developed to help the CF-affected male population preserve their reproductive function.In a variety of epithelia, water channels (aquaporins) are involved in transepithelial bulk water flow driven by an osmotic gradient (reviewed in Ref. 23King L.S. Kozono D. Agre P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In mammals, aquaporins are divided into two subgroups based on their permeability characteristics: the strict “aquaporins” (AQP0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8) are selective for water and the “aquaglyceroporins” (AQP3, 7, 9, and 10) are permeable to neutral solutes in addition to water. AQP11 and AQP12 have recently been identified and are more distantly related to the other members of the aquaporin family (24Zardoya R. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 397-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins show a wide range of distribution in organs that are actively involved in water movement (25Brown D. Katsura T. Kawashima M. Verkman A.S. Sabolic I. Histochem.

AQP9 has been identified as the major aquaglyceroporin in the excurrent duct of the male reproductive tract, the liver, and peripheral leukocytes (30Badran H.H. Hermo L.S. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: F685-F696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the male reproductive system, it is constitutively expressed in the apical stereocilia of principal cells along the entire length of the epididymis and vas deferens, as well as in the apical membrane of non-ciliated cells of the efferent ducts (32Pastor-Soler N. Bagnis C. Sabolic I. Tyszkowski R. McKee M. Van Hoek A. Breton S. Brown D. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This aquaglyceroporin allows passage of a wide range of solutes, including glycerol, urea, mannitol, and sorbitol, in addition to water (35Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B.

Thus, AQP9 provides a potential route for transepithelial fluid and solute transport in the epididymis. The promoter region of AQP9 contains a putative steroid hormone receptor-binding site (35Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and sex-linked differences in AQP9 expression were reported in the liver (37Nicchia G.P. Frigeri A. Nico B. Ribatti D. Svelto M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Androgens control AQP9 expression in the adult epididymis (30Badran H.H.

Cell. 2005; 97: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and Aqp9 mRNA increases markedly during the first 4 weeks of postnatal development (31Da Silva N. Silberstein C. Beaulieu V. Pietrement C. Van Hoek A.N. Brown D. Breton S. Biol. Reprod. 2006; 74: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the acute regulation of AQP9 function has not been well characterized. The presence of a putative PDZ (PSD-95, Drosophila discs large protein, ZO-1) binding motif, SVIM, in the COOH terminus of AQP9 indicates the potential intervention of PDZ proteins in its regulation. PDZ proteins are scaffolding proteins that facilitate the association of multiprotein complexes, a process that is essential for the phosphorylation of some transporters, channels, and receptors (39Brone B. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C20-C29Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Physiol. (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). NHERF1 (Na/H exchanger regulatory factor; SLC9A3R1) is a major apical PDZ protein that contains three protein interaction domains: PDZ domain 1 (PDZ-1), PDZ domain 2 (PDZ-2), and a sequence located in the COOH terminus that binds to the family of Merlin/Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (MERM) proteins (41Gonzalez-Agosti C.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2951-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NHERF1 is involved in the cAMP regulation of a variety of transporters, including Na+/H+ exchanger type 3 (NHE3), CFTR, Na+-Pi cotransporter IIa (Npt2 or NaPi Iia) (reviewed in Refs. 39Brone B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 6863-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Water transport and solute transport represent crucial events in the establishment and maintenance of male fertility, and we postulated that CFTR might be involved in their regulation. The present study is aimed at characterizing the functional contribution of AQP9 to apical glycerol permeability and at determining whether the apical PDZ protein NHERF1, and the PDZ-binding protein, CFTR, could participate in its regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFunctional Studies on Epididymal Tubules Perfused in Vitro—Epididymal tubules were dissected from the initial segments of the epididymis in a cold preservation solution containing 56 mm Na2HPO4, 13 mm NaH2PO4, and 140 mm sucrose, as described previously (47Bagnis C. Marsolais M. Biemesderfer D. Laprade R. Breton S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F426-F436PubMed Google Scholar). They were then transferred into a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope, and peritubular and luminal perfusions were performed (solutions in Table 1). The basolateral solution composition was based on normal plasma values, and the apical solution was based on previous epididymal micropuncture studies (5Levine N. Marsh D.J. J. Physiol. 1971; 213: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). After an initial control period, the apical membrane permeability to glycerol was estimated from the initial rate of increase in cellular volume induced upon isotonic replacement of either 60 or 120 mm raffinose (an impermeant solute in the epididymal tubule) with glycerol. Digital images of perfused tubules were captured at 15- or 30-s intervals, as described in the text, using a Nikon Coolpix 995 camera and were analyzed using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). For each time point, the height of epithelial cells was measured at 5-6 different locations along the tubule, and the values were averaged. Cell volume was assessed from these values and expressed as percentage of initial control volume, as we have previously published for kidney proximal tubules (48Breton S. Beck J.S. Cardinal J. Giebisch G. Laprade R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F656-F664PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rates of cell swelling were determined from four cell volume values measured at 15-s intervals during the first minute of glycerol exposure. The effects of 500 μm phloretin, an AQP9 inhibitor, or 100 μm chlorophenylthio cAMP (cpt-cAMP) on glycerol-induced cell swelling were examined. We also examined the effects of three different CFTR inhibitors, DPC (500 μm), GlyH-101 (25 μm), and CFTRinh-172 (5 μm). GlyH-101 and CFTRinh-172 are previously characterized specific CFTR inhibitors kindly provided by Alan Verkman (University of California, San Francisco) (49Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H.

An affinity purified anti-rat AQP9 antibody raised in chicken (Chemicon International; Temecula, CA) was also used for Western blotting of material immunoprecipitated using our rabbit anti-AQP9 antibody. An affinity purified chicken polyclonal antibody was raised against a GST-NHERF1 fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 270-358 (IC270), which we used previously for the generation of a polyclonal rabbit antibody (41Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of AQP9 was generated in the Massachusetts General Hospital Peptide/Protein Core Facility, and some of the peptide was biotinylated. Three different anti-CFTR antibodies were used for immunofluorescence and Western blot detection. AME-4991 is the whole serum of a previously characterized antibody raised in rabbit against a synthetic 13-residue peptide of the carboxyl terminus of rat CFTR (51Golin-Bisello F. Bradbury N. Ameen N. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C708-C716Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A commercial rabbit affinity purified antibody against amino acid residues 1468-1480 of human CFTR (ACL-006 from Alomone) and a monoclonal antibody against amino acids 1377-1480 of human CFTR (Clone 24-1, MAB25031 from R&D Systems) were also used.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Sexually mature male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with Nembutal (7.5 mg/100 g body weight intraperitoneal; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and perfused via the left ventricle with PBS (0.9% NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) followed by a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 10 mm sodium periodate, 75 mm lysine, and 5% sucrose in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, as described previously (32Pastor-Soler N.

Reprod. 2002; 66: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), or with PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde (for CFTR labeling). Epididymis and vas deferens were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS, mounted for cryosectioning in Tissue-Tek OCT compound 4583 (Sakura Fintek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA), and quick frozen. Sections were cut at a thickness of 5 μm using a Reichert-Jung 2800 Frigocut cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) and picked up onto Superfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). For indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, sections were hydrated for 15 min in PBS and treated for 4 min with 1% SDS in PBS, an antigen retrieval technique that we have previously described (52Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 5 min and then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 15 min. Affinity purified rabbit anti-AQP9 antibody was applied at a dilution of 1:3200 in a moist chamber for 90 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed in high salt PBS (PBS containing 2.7% NaCl) twice for 5 min and once in normal PBS. Goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to CY3 was then applied for 1 h at room temperature followed by washes as above. Sections were double-stained by subsequent incubation with anti-NHERF1 antibody diluted 1:50 followed by donkey anti-chicken IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, or with anti-CFTR antibody MAB25031 diluted 1:10, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Double labeling was also performed using anti-AQP9 chicken antibody diluted 1:50 followed by anti-CFTR AME-4991 antibody diluted 1:50.Slides were mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Digital images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse 800 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon instruments, Inc., Melville, NY) using an Orca 100 CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ), analyzed using IPLab scientific image processing software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA), and imported into Adobe Photoshop image editing software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA).Apical Membrane Preparation—Epithelial cell apical membranes were isolated using the brush border membrane (BBM) Mg2+ precipitation technique, as previously described (32Pastor-Soler N. Bagnis C. Sabolic I. Tyszkowski R. McKee M. Van Hoek A. Breton S. Brown D. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Pastor-Soler N. Isnard-Bagnis C. Herak-Kramberger C. Sabolic I. Van Hoek A. Brown D. Breton S. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1716-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that AQP9 is significantly enriched in epididymal BBM (32Pastor-Soler N. Bagnis C. Sabolic I. Tyszkowski R. McKee M. Van Hoek A. Breton S. Brown D. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology) using albumin as standard.IP and Co-IP Assays—Anti-AQP9 rabbit antibody was conjugated to magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein A, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The epididymal BBM preparation (250 μg) was pre-cleared by two consecutive 30-min incubations with non-conjugated magnetic beads. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed in 1 ml of IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm IGEPAL CA-630, 10% glycerol, 1% bovine serum albumin, complete protease inhibitors) for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes in 1 ml of IP buffer, beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli reducing sample buffer, and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Beads were captured using a magnetic particle concentrator (Invitrogen), and eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, as described below. For some experiments, the anti-AQP9 antibody was preincubated with the non-biotinylated AQP9 peptide prior to immobilization on the beads. In separate experiments, CFTR and AQP9 co-IP assays were performed using rabbit anti-CFTR antibody (Alomone) and our rabbit anti-AQP9 antibody, which were bound and cross-linked to immobilized protein A using the Seize X Protein A immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). This procedure allowed for Western blot detection of proteins in the IP material using antibodies raised in the same species as that used for the IP. Total proteins from rat epididymis and lung were isolated using the ProFound lysis buffer (Pierce) complemented with protease inhibitors. CFTR co-IP was performed by incubating the immobilized anti-CFTR antibody sequentially with 1 mg of lung extract for 4 h, then with 1 mg of epididymis extract enriched with BBM overnight. This sequence was reversed to perform the AQP9 co-IP. After three washes, proteins were eluted in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) with reducing agent and protease inhibitors, incubated for 45 min at 23 °C, and analyzed by Western blotting.Immunoblotting (SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting)—Total epididymis homogenates, BBM samples, or IP eluates were diluted in sample buffer, and loaded onto Tris glycine polyacrylamide 4-20% gradient gels (Lonza, Rockland, ME). 4-12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) were used for the analysis of CFTR/AQP9 co-IPs. After SDS-PAGE separation, proteins were transferred onto Immuno-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (anti-AQP9, -NHERF1, or -CFTR) diluted in TBS containing 2.5% milk. After three washes in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and a 15-min block in 5% milk/TBS, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (either goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-chicken IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After five further washes, antibody binding was detected with the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Kodak imaging films.Phosphatase Assay—330 μg (50 μl) of epididymis total homogenate was incubated with 100 μl of 1 mm Tris, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min at 30 °C. 30 Units (30 μl) of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) was then added (water was added in the control sample) and the solution was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Dephosphorylation was terminated by the addition of 180 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (2 times). 30 μl of each sample (containing 27 μg of protein) were then subjected to electrophoresis and Western blot, as described above.Preparation of Recombinant NHERF1—Human full-length NHERF1 (amino acids (aa) 1-358) and NHERF1 truncated fusion proteins containing PDZ1 (aa 11-97), PDZ2 (aa 149-236), PDZ1 and PDZ2 (aa 11-236), PDZ2 and the COOH-terminal portion (aa 149-358), and NHERF1 lacking both PDZ domains (aa 270-358) were amplified by PCR, subcloned into the BamHI-NotI sites of pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences), and expressed in Escherichia coli, as described previously (43James M.F.

Here, we show that activation of the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), a common molecular response to several drugs of abuse, increases both duration of the upstate and action potential firing during the upstate. This effect of CREB is mediated by enhanced N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) function: increased CREB activity increases both NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents and surface level of NMDARs, while inhibition of NMDARs abolishes the effect of CREB on upstate duration. Furthermore, mimicking the effect of CREB by pharmacological enhancement of NMDAR function in the NAc in vivo suppressed novelty- and cocaine-elicited locomotor activity. These findings suggest that by enhancing NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, CREB activation promotes the proportion of time NAc neurons spend in the upstate. This effect, along with the CREB enhancement of NAc membrane excitability (Dong, Y., Green, T., Saal, D., Marie, H., Neve, R., Nestler, E. J., and Malenka, R. C. (2006) Nat. Neurosci. 9, 475-477), may counteract drug-induced maladaptations in the NAc and thus ameliorate the addictive state."

Apoptosis is the physiological process responsible for the demise of superfluous, aged, damaged, and ectopic cells and is essential during embryonic development and for maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis (1Garrido C. Kroemer G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Among the numerous proteins implicated in apoptosis is Scythe (BAT3; HLA-B associated transcript; Bag 6). Scythe has been shown to interact with Reaper, a central regulator of developmental apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster (2Thress K. Henzel W. Shillinglaw W. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6135-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Thress K. Evans E.K. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To date, no Reaper homologues have been discovered in vertebrate species, but Reaper and associated Drosophila regulators Hid and Grim can induce apoptosis in mammalian systems (4Tait S.W.

The interaction between Scythe and Reaper is required for Reaper-induced apoptosis in Xenopus egg extracts and results in the release of an as yet unidentified Scythe-bound apoptotic-inducing factor, leading to rapid mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. Immunodepletion of Scythe prevented reaper-induced apoptosis (2Thress K. Henzel W. Shillinglaw W. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6135-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Thress K.

We found that inactivation of Scythe in the mouse resulted in lethality associated with pronounced developmental defects in the lung, kidney, and brain (6Desmots F. Russell H.R. Lee Y. Boyd K.

Co-incident with organogenesis defects was widespread aberrant apoptosis and proliferation, and a resistance of Scythe-null cells to apoptosis (6Desmots F. Russell H.R. Lee Y. Boyd K. McKinnon P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10329-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A critical step in apoptosis is often the permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, leading to the release of proteins that are normally localized behind the outer mitochondrial membrane (7Spierings D. McStay G. Saleh M. Bender C. Chipuk J. Maurer U. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 310: 66-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).

In apoptotic cells, AIF relocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus where it exerts its pro-apoptotic activity via chromatin condensation and large scale DNA fragmentation (12Cregan S.P.

Here, we show that Scythe interacts with and regulates the stability and location of AIF after apoptotic stimuli mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Thus, AIF action is impaired in Scythe-/- cells, which could account for their resistance to select apoptotic stimuli. Our data provide new insight into apoptotic regulation by Scythe and its relationship to the pro-apoptotic protein AIF. Cells and Culture ConditionsHuman embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator. Primary culture of MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were obtained from E13.5 WT and Scythe-/- embryos and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin, 25 mm Hepes and non-essential amino acid in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator. Primary MEFs were not used beyond passage eight. DNA Constructs and TransfectionFull-length Scythe (FL-Scythe) and truncated Scythe variants (Scy-NΔ380 or CΔ482), full-length AIF (FL-AIF), and truncated AIF (tAIF) (all HA-tagged) cDNA were cloned into a murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector that contained an internal ribosome entry site to allow coincident expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Human AIF full-length sequence corresponds to amino acids 1–612 (GenBank™ accession number AF 100928), whereas truncated AIF lacks the 100 first amino acids containing the mitochondrial location sequence. After co-transfection with ecotropic packaging constructs in 293T cells, individual viruses were harvested daily for 3 days and then pooled. MEFs (1 × 106 cells per 10-cm diameter culture dish) were infected three times (3-h intervals) with 10 ml of ecotropic virus-containing supernatant supplemented with 8 μg of Polybrene (Sigma). For transient transfections, fusion proteins were generated by cloning Scythe and AIF (both full-length sequences) cDNA into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). Mutants of Scythe cDNA were cloned into a pcDNA3-HA vector. For transient transfection Nucleofector™ technology (Amaxa Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoblotting and ImmunoprecipitationMEFs were homogenized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche)). Proteins were separated on 8 or 4–12% NOVEX Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and detected using antibodies to Scythe (6Desmots F. Russell H.R. Lee Y. Boyd K. McKinnon P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10329-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), AIF (Sigma), HA (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), GFP (Molecular probes), FLAG-M2 (Sigma), or Actin (Santa Cruz). To study protein-protein interactions, 293T cells or MEFs were trypsinized 48 h after transfection, washed with PBS, and cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (described above) and sonicated. Lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of the indicated antibodies, followed by a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads and washed three times in lysis buffer. Immune complexes were boiled in 2× sample buffer, separated on an 8 or 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), and then electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunofluorescence StudiesCells grown on tissue culture-treated glassed slides (BD Falcon) were treated or transfected as indicated, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and washed several times in PBS. For cells transfected with GFP-AIF or Scythe fusion proteins, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 nm of a red fluorescent dye that stains the mitochondria in live cells (MitoTracker Red CMXRos; Molecular Probes), then loading solution was replaced with prewarmed medium and cells were directly observed using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS Sp2). Co-localization analysis has been performed using ImageJ (WCIF ImageJ package) with the plug-in Intensity Correlation Analysis. For cells transfected with MSCV- or pcDNA3-HA-tagged protein, cells were incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST)), followed by anti-HA antibody at 1 μg/ml in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBST for 5 min, and then incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Cy3) 1 h in the dark. After being washed three times in PBST for 5 min, cells were mounted in Vectashield solution and examined under a confocal microscope (Leica TCS Sp2). Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase AssaysFor the GFP-AIF stability experiment, WT and Scythe-/- MEFs were transfected with pEGFP or pEGFP-AIF. For endogenous AIF stability experiments, WT, Scythe-/-, or Scythe-/- transduced with MSCV-FL-Scythe MEFs were used. Then cells were washed with PBS and preincubated for 60 min with methionine- and leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 4 mm glutamine. Cells were labeled for 2 h in the same medium with 10 μCi/ml of l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Science), and chased in complete media. During the chase, in all experiments cells were treated with 1 μm TG. At various times after termination of labeling, cells were isolated in lysis buffer (described above), sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and soluble proteins were quantified using a Bio-Rad assay. Proteins (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP or polyclonal rabbit anti-AIF antibodies as indicated. Immune complexes recovered by protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with lysis buffer were denatured and electrophoretically separated on NOVEX 8% Tris glycine denaturing gels (Invitrogen), then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Dried membranes were coated with EN3HANCE and subjected to autoradiography. Corresponding lysates (Lysates 35S) were loaded as control for an equal amount of proteins, as well as equal incorporation of 35S. Quantification of the bands was performed by the Image processing tool kit software (Reindeer Graphics, Inc.). Apoptosis AssaysMEFs were cultured at 1 × 106 per 10-cm diameter culture dish. These cells were treated with 1 μm thapsigargin, 100 μm 2-APB, 50 nm staurosporine, 100 ng/ml Fas, 20 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α, 10 μm camptothecin, and 20 μm hydrogen peroxide, for 24 h. Apoptosis was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of cells stained with Annexin V FITC/propidium iodide (Alexis Biochemicals) or by measuring DEVD-caspase activity (using the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AMC). For the rescue experiment, after Scythe-GFP transfection, Annexin-V FITC/propidium iodide was counted only on GFP positive cells. In other experiments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and TUNEL assay was performed using ApopTag Apoptosis Detection Systems (Serologicals Corporation). Quantitative RT-PCRWT and Scythe-/- MEFs (0.4 × 106) were treated with 1 μm TG for 24 h. RNA extraction was performed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and 2.5 μg of extracted RNA were converted into cDNA using random primers (Amersham Biosciences) and reverse transcriptase with Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR for GAPDH and AIF were performed in triplicates, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and 54 °C for 30 s were carried out in a 12-μl volume containing 75 ng of cDNA, 300 nm custom made primers, and 6 μl of iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). All primers were custom made at Sigma-Proligo and tested to ensure amplification of single bands with no primer-dimers. PCR efficiencies for different pairs of primers were verified by a standard curve method on serially diluted templates and were found to be comprised between 85 and 108% as requested using the formula E = 10(-1/P) - 1. Real-time PCR data were collected using the MiniOpticon2™ real-time cycler (Bio-Rad). Relative quantities of the transcripts were calculated by normalizing to the quantity of GAPDH transcript, using the formula 2-ΔΔCt. The GAPDH and AIF set of primers that produced PCR products of 101 and 188 bp, respectively, are for GAPDH, 5′-TGAAGCAGGCATCTGAGGG (forward) and 5′-CGAAGGTGGAAGAGTGGGAG (reverse) and for AIF, 5′-ACCTCAGCAACTGGACCATGG (forward) and 5′-GTCTTGGCCAACTCAACATTG (reverse). Scythe-/- MEFs Are Resistant to Thapsigargin-induced Cell DeathWe previously found that Scythe-/- primary cortical neurons were more resistant than WT cells to cell death resulting from endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling induced by TG or menadione (6Desmots F. Russell H.R. Lee Y. Boyd K. McKinnon P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10329-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of Scythe in this phenomenon, we examined the sensitivity of WT and Scythe-/- MEFs to treatment with several agents. By analyzing Annexin V positive cells using flow cytometry (Fig. 1A), we found that Scythe-/- MEFs are more resistant to various pro-apoptotic agents, and particularly to TG, compared with WT MEFs. Several time points and concentrations of TG were tested using either Annexin V or crystal violet staining (supplemental Fig. S1). A 24-h treatment with 1 μm TG was then used in this study. Apoptotic resistance of Scythe-/- MEFs to TG was also confirmed by measuring caspase 3/7 activity (Fig. 1B). To confirm that resistance to TG-induced cell death is dependent upon Scythe, we reintroduced Scythe in Scythe-/- MEFs by retroviral transduction and found that apoptosis levels of GFP-Scythe positive cells were similar to WT, whereas vector alone did not rescue apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Scythe Interacts with the Apoptosis-inducing Factor AIFTG was shown to induce mitochondrial permeability transition and the release of AIF (15Sanges D. Marigo V. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1629-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of Scythe in cortical neurons (6Desmots F. Russell H.R. Lee Y. Boyd K. McKinnon P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10329-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and that of AIF in embryonic stem cells, increases resistance to cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress (16Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.Y. Ravagnan L. Ferri K.F. Zamzami N. Wakeham A. Hakem R. Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Mak T.W. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Kroemer G. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated the possible relationships between Scythe and AIF. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that endogenous Scythe and AIF strongly interact together (Fig. 2A). Scythe and eAIF interaction was also obtained in MEFs after transfection of Scythe-FL or certain Scythe mutants (Scythe-CΔ482, lacking the C-terminal sequence or Scythe-NΔ380, lacking the N-terminal sequence as shown in Fig. 2B). We found an interaction between Scythe-FL and eAIF and also between the C-terminal mutant and eAIF in MEFs, but not with Scythe-NΔ380 mutant (Fig. 2C). We transfected 293T cells with an N-terminal fluorescent full-length-AIF fusion protein (GFP-AIF) and FL-Scythe or Scythe mutants, and found a strong interaction between GFP-AIF and Scythe-FL or CΔ482-, but again not with the NΔ380-Scythe mutant (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that AIF interacts with Scythe within a region encompassing its N terminus. To determine the specificity of this interaction and if it involves the ubiquitin-like N-terminal domain of Scythe, we tested the interaction between Scythe and RAD23, which also contains a ubiquitin-like domain, and found that RAD23, even when highly expressed, does not interact with AIF (data not shown). This suggests that the interaction between AIF and Scythe is mediated by the N-terminal region of Scythe but this interaction is independent of the ubiquitin-like region. Finally, we found an interaction between in vitro translated Scythe and AIF, which suggests a direct physical interaction can occur between these two proteins (Fig. 2E). Scythe Modulates GFP-AIF TurnoverTo further investigate the interplay between Scythe and AIF during apoptosis, we used GFP-AIF fusion protein and checked its expression in WT and Scythe-/- cells. We found that the GFP-AIF protein level was markedly reduced in Scythe-/- cells compared with WT cells, whereas GFP protein expression is similar in both cell types (Fig. 3A). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 fully restored GFP-AIF expression in Scythe-/- cells, indicating that proteasomal degradation of GFP-AIF is increased in the absence of Scythe. Surprisingly, we observed that GFP-AIF overexpression induces apoptosis by itself, without need for an additional apoptotic treatment. Therefore, we checked if the attenuated GFP-AIF protein level in Scythe-/- cells correlated with lower apoptosis. GFP-AIF induced apoptosis in WT cells and to a lesser extent in Scythe-/- cells (Fig. 3B). MG132 treatment restored both GFP-AIF stability and the apoptotic activity in Scythe-/- cells. To confirm that the level of apoptosis induced by GFP-AIF is dependent on Scythe, we reintroduced Scythe in Scythe-/- MEFs. Transfected Scythe restored GFP-AIF expression (Fig. 3C) and GFP-AIF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3D) in Scythe-/- cells. To further investigate the connection between Scythe and GFP-AIF protein levels described above, we used pulse-chase analysis to determine whether GFP-AIF fusion protein stability is affected by loss of Scythe. Cells transfected with either GFP or GFP-AIF were metabolically labeled with l-[35S]methionine and chased for various periods of time. Total lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, resolved on denaturing gels, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 3E). The half-life of GFP was around ∼8 h in WT and Scythe-/- MEFs. In contrast, that of GFP-AIF was only ∼2 h in Scythe-/- cells, but ∼5 h in WT cells. These results confirmed that Scythe markedly influences the stability of GFP-AIF. Decreased Expression of Endogenous AIF after TG Treatment in Scythe-/- Cells Contributes to Their Resistance to ApoptosisThe previous experiments were obtained using transfected AIF. We then checked endogenous expression of AIF (eAIF) in control and TG-treated WT and Scythe-/- cells (Fig. 4A). We observed a decrease in eAIF protein level after TG treatment in WT cells, but this was more pronounced in Scythe-/- cells (Fig. 4A). The decrease in eAIF expression occurred at a post-translational level because RT-PCR analysis showed unchanged Aif gene expression in these cells upon TG treatment (Fig. 4B). The lower eAIF protein level observed in Scythe-/- cells could result from indirect compensatory developmental mechanisms after Scythe inactivation, rather than a direct stabilizing activity of Scythe. Hence, we checked for eAIF expression after re-introduction of Scythe into Scythe-/- MEFs treated with TG and found that eAIF expression was increased in these cells as compared with Scythe-/- cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that eAIF stability is directly influenced by Scythe. We therefore checked the stability of eAIF using pulse-chase analysis in WT and Scythe-/- or Scythe-/- cells transduced with MSCV-FL-Scythe (Scythe-/-T-Sc.FL). During the chase, cells were treated with 1 μm TG. eAIF half-life was reduced in Scythe-/- cells treated with TG compared with WT (Fig. 4D). In addition, when Scythe-/- cells were transduced with a Scythe expression vector and treated with TG, eAIF stability was restored (Fig. 4D). To confirm that resistance to TG-induced cell death is dependent on AIF expression, we overexpressed full-length AIF (FL.Flag.AIF) or a truncated mutant of AIF (T.HA.AIF) lacking the N-terminal sequence containing the mitochondrial localization sequence, in Scythe-/- MEFs by retroviral transduction. T.HA.AIF and FL.FLAG.AIF expression were checked by Western blot (Fig. 4E) and as expected, only FL.FLAG.AIF is decreased after TG treatment in Scythe-/- cells. Moreover, full-length AIF overexpression restored sensitivity of Scythe-/- cells to apoptosis (Fig. 4F). These results demonstrated that in Scythe-/- cells, AIF stability is markedly reduced and this potentially contributes to their increased resistance to apoptosis induced by TG. Scythe and AIF Co-localize in the Cytosol after TG TreatmentTo determine the site of action of Scythe on AIF stability, we examined the location of these two proteins in control and TG-treated MEFs. We transfected GFP-Scythe and GFP-AIF fusion proteins alone and different versions of Scythe (HA-Scy-FL or the cytosolic mutant of Scythe, HA-Scy-CΔ482) within GFP-AIF and checked their location using confocal microscopy in control or TG-treated WT and Scythe-/- cells. The results obtained with WT and Scythe-/- cells were similar. Representative images are shown in Fig. 5. GFP-AIF clearly co-localized with MitoTracker and the mitochondria in control cells and to the nucleus after TG treatment (Fig. 5A). GFP-Scythe was nuclear in control cells and partially co-localized with MitoTracker in TG-treated cells, suggesting that it is subject to nuclear export during apoptosis (Fig. 5B). We observed a similar nuclear export of endogenous Scythe after TG treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). Then, we transfected MEFs with HA-FL-Scythe or HA-Scy-CΔ482 (mutant of Scythe that co-localized with the mitochondria as shown in supplemental Fig. S3) with GFP-AIF, and cells were treated with TG. In control cells, HA-FL-Scythe, immunodetected using HA antibody, was predominantly nuclear (Fig. 5C), whereas HA-Scy-CΔ482 and GFP-AIF co-localized in the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm of these cells (Fig. 5D). After TG treatment, FL-Scythe or the cytosolic mutant of Scythe and GFP-AIF co-localized in the cytosol. These results suggest that the cytosol is a main site of interaction between Scythe and AIF in cells undergoing apoptosis. Inactivation of Scythe leads to a variety of developmental defects involving the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system, resulting in either midgestational or perinatal lethality (6Desmots F. Russell H.R. Lee Y. Boyd K. McKinnon P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10329-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Coincident with these abnormalities are widespread apoptosis and proliferation defects (6Desmots F. Russell H.R. Lee Y. Boyd K. McKinnon P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10329-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Very little is known about how this important protein functions as an apoptotic regulator in mammalian cells. Initial biochemical evidence that Scythe plays a role in apoptosis comes from the formation of a caspase-3-cleaved Scythe C-terminal fragment with pro-apoptotic activity after ricin treatment (17Wu Y.H. Shih S.F. Lin J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19264-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and also the interaction of Scythe with immediate early gene X-1 that is involved in the control of apoptosis and cellular growth (18Kumar R. Lutz W. Frank E. Im H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More recently, Scythe has been identified as a regulator of p53 transcriptional activity, suggesting a role in the response to genotoxic stress (19Sasaki T. Gan E.C. Wakeham A. Kornbluth S. Mak T.W. Okada H. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 848-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a novel role of Scythe relevant for its apoptotic function. Previously, Scythe has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. In Xenopus egg extracts, the binding of (Drosophila) Reaper to Scythe promoted cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation leading to cell death (2Thress K. Henzel W. Shillinglaw W. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6135-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Thress K. Evans E.K. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, Scythe was proposed to sequester an unknown apoptotic factor that is sufficient, when released upon Reaper addition, to induce apoptosis (3Thress K. Evans E.K. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that AIF could be such a factor in a mammalian system. AIF was originally linked to a caspase-independent death pathway (14Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3451) Google Scholar), although it has been proposed that mitochondrial release of AIF occurs downstream of cytochrome c release, either independently or concomitantly with caspase activation (20Otera H. Ohsakaya S. Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). p53-dependent caspase 2 activation has recently been linked to AIF release from mitochondria after cisplatin treatment (21Seth R. Yang C. Kaushal V. Shah S.V. Kaushal G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31230-31239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, MEFs from mice deficient in both caspase 3 and 7 were shown defective in nuclear translocation of AIF (22Lakhani S.A. Masud A. Kuida K. Porter Jr., G.A. Booth C.J. Mehal W.Z. Inayat I. Flavell R.A. Science. 2006; 311: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), suggesting that AIF release requires caspases activation. In this study, we found an interaction between the AIF and Scythe and have provided biochemical evidence for a regulatory role for Scythe in modulating AIF stability and location after TG treatment. We showed that Scythe is able to regulate AIF protein levels, thus modulating apoptosis. In addition, we observed a protection of Scythe-/- MEFs from AIF-driven apoptosis, probably because of the destabilization of AIF in these cells. Accordingly, a recent study established that AIF release from mitochondria is necessary for mediating apoptosis induced by TG (15Sanges D. Marigo V. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1629-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and showed that down-regulation of AIF by RNA interference prevents cell demise when calcium homeostasis is disrupted by TG. Another report indicated that the two ubiquitin-like domains of Scythe interact with the proteosomal Xrpn10c subunit and that these domains are required for normal development of the Xenopus embryo (23Kikukawa Y. Minami R. Shimada M. Kobayashi M. Tanaka K. Yokosawa H. Kawahara H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6373-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The proteasome machinery is implicated in the normal control of apoptosis or proliferation via its ability to regulate degradation of a wide variety of molecules involved in these functions (24Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar, 25Hershko A. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 26Miller J. Gordon C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3224-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Welchman R.L. Gordon C. Mayer R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In Scythe-/- cells, endogenous AIF protein half-life was shorter after pro-apoptotic treatment, further supporting a role for Scythe in regulating AIF function. This conclusion is supported by our finding that Scythe expression restores the level of AIF expression in Scythe-/- cells and increases AIF-driven apoptosis. The proteasome is involved in this phenomenon because we could maintain AIF protein level and consequently increase apoptosis in Scythe-/- cells using a proteasome inhibitor. Moreover, overexpression of AIF in Scythe-/- cells restores their sensitivity to apoptosis. Together, our data indicate that Scythe is important for regulating AIF protein stability, via a mechanism involving the proteasome and that the decreased level of AIF in Scythe-/- cells is likely to be involved in their resistance to apoptosis. Scythe co-localized with AIF in the cytosol of TG-treated cells suggesting that Scythe transiently affects the nuclear translocation of AIF during apoptosis. A plausible hypothesis is that Scythe could protect AIF from degradation and perhaps favor its apoptotic action in the cytosol. Indeed, whereas the function of AIF in the nucleus is well documented (13Cheung E.C. Joza N. Steenaart N.A. McClellan K.A. Neuspiel M. McNamara S. MacLaurin J.G. Rippstein P. Park D.S. Shore G.C. McBride H.M. Penninger J.M. Slack R.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4061-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), its action in the cytoplasm has recently emerged where it has been shown to activate caspase 7 (28Kim J.T. Kim K.D. Song E.Y. Lee H.G. Kim J.W. Chae S.K. Kim E. Lee M.S. Yang Y. Lim J.S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6375-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Scythe, by stabilizing and maintaining AIF in the cytosol may function as a central regulator of the action of AIF. In summary, our data describing a novel regulatory complex between Scythe and AIF thereby provide new insights into the basic physiology of cell death.

We demonstrate here a central role for stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, c-Kit, in tuning the responsiveness of sensory neurons to natural stimuli. Mice lacking SCF/c-Kit signaling displayed profound thermal hypoalgesia, attributable to a marked elevation in the thermal threshold and reduction in spiking rate of heat-sensitive nociceptors. Acute activation of c-Kit by its ligand, SCF, resulted in a reduced thermal threshold and potentiation of heat-activated currents in isolated small-diameter neurons and thermal hyperalgesia in mice. SCF-induced thermal hyperalgesia required the TRP family cation channel TRPV1. Lack of c-Kit signaling during development resulted in hypersensitivity of discrete mechanoreceptive neuronal subtypes. Thus, c-Kit can now be grouped with a small family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Ret and TrkA, that control the transduction properties of sensory neurons.

Thus, c-Kit can now be grouped with a small family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Ret and TrkA, that control the transduction properties of sensory neurons. Somatic sensations such as warming, cooling, gentle touch, and pain are each initiated by activation of sensory neurons. Specific types of sensory neurons, whose cell bodies are located in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, subserve different sensory modalities. Specialized sensory neurons called nociceptors are responsible for the transduction of painful thermal and mechanical stimulation of the skin. Knowledge about molecules and ion channels that are necessary for the normal transduction of painful thermal and mechanical stimuli is still incomplete (Lewin and Moshourab, 2004Lewin G.R. Moshourab R. Mechanosensation and pain.J. Neurobiol. 2004; 61: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that thermosensitive ion channels of the TRP family are important for the transduction of noxious heat or cold by nociceptive sensory neurons (Jordt et al., 2003Jordt S.E. McKemy D.D. Julius D. Lessons from peppers and peppermint: the molecular logic of thermosensation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The most complete evidence exists for the capsaicin-activated ion channel TRPV1 that can be activated by thermal stimuli in the noxious range (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6541) Google Scholar, Tominaga et al., 1998Tominaga M. Caterina M.J.

The cloned capsaicin receptor integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli.Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Mice lacking TRPV1 have altered pain behavior and do not respond to the noxious irritant capsaicin (Caterina et al., 2000Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Impaired nociception and pain sensation in mice lacking the capsaicin receptor.Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar, Davis et al., 2000Davis J.B. Gray J.

Atkinson K. et al.Vanilloid receptor-1 is essential for inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia.Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). An important feature of pain is the fact that injury and inflammation lead to heightened sensitivity to stimuli that would normally be only mildly painful. This phenomenon is called hyperalgesia, and the prevention of hyperalgesia is a hallmark of effective analgesia. TRPV1 may become an important analgesic target because this channel is required for the expression of thermal hyperalgesia provoked by inflammation (Caterina et al., 2000Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Impaired nociception and pain sensation in mice lacking the capsaicin receptor.Science. 2000; 288: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar, Davis et al., 2000Davis J.B. Gray J.

Atkinson K. et al.Vanilloid receptor-1 is essential for inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia.Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Molecules upregulated in inflamed tissue such as nerve growth factor (NGF) can sensitize peripheral nociceptors to thermal stimuli (Lewin et al., 1993Lewin G.R. Ritter A.M. Mendell L.M. Nerve growth factor-induced hyperalgesia in the neonatal and adult rat.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2136-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NGF signaling via its receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA is necessary for the survival of subpopulations of peripheral neurons during periods of programmed cell death (Huang and Reichardt, 2003Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Trk receptors: roles in neuronal signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). It has been known for many years that the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that require NGF are all nociceptors (Lewin and Mendell, 1993Lewin G.R. Mendell L.M. Nerve growth factor and nociception.Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 353-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). NGF/TrkA signaling is required for neuronal survival during embryonic development, but in mature animals NGF is also a physiological mediator of inflammatory hyperalgesia (Lewin et al., 1994Lewin G.R. Rueff A. Mendell L.M. Peripheral and central mechanisms of NGF-induced hyperalgesia.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1903-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, Woolf et al., 1994Woolf C.J.

Nerve growth factor contributes to the generation of inflammatory sensory hypersensitivity.Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Thus, NGF can produce a profound and long-lasting thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in man and animals (Lewin et al., 1993Lewin G.R. Ritter A.M. Mendell L.M. Nerve growth factor-induced hyperalgesia in the neonatal and adult rat.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2136-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Petty et al., 1994Petty B.G. Cornblath D.R. Adornato B.T.

Neurol. 1994; 36: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). NGF can also potentiate TRPV1-mediated and noxious heat-activated ionic currents (Iheat) in isolated DRG neurons (Galoyan et al., 2003Galoyan S.M. Petruska J.C. Mendell L.M. Mechanisms of sensitization of the response of single dorsal root ganglion cells from adult rat to noxious heat.Eur. J.

Nerve growth factor acutely sensitizes the response of adult rat sensory neurons to capsaicin.Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Indeed, NGF injected into animals produces thermal hyperalgesia that requires the presence of TRPV1 (Chuang et al., 2001Chuang H.H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Bradykinin and nerve growth factor release the capsaicin receptor from PtdIns(4,5)P2-mediated inhibition.Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Around half of the nociceptors in the adult DRG possess TrkA receptors; the remainder, defined by the expression of c-Ret, downregulate TrkA during early postnatal development (Luo et al., 2007Luo W. Wickramasinghe S.R. Savitt J.M. Griffin J.W. Dawson T.M. Ginty D.D.

McMahon S.B. Tackling pain at the source: new ideas about nociceptors.Neuron. 1998; 20: 629-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Ret mediates signals elicited by the glial-derived neurotophic factor (GDNF) ligand family (Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. The GDNF family: signalling, biological functions and therapeutic value.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). The c-Ret receptor and its coreceptors GFRα2 and -3 are present in nociceptive neurons, some of which are heat sensitive and express TRPV1 receptors (Malin et al., 2006Malin S.A. Molliver D.C. Koerber H.R. Cornuet P. Frye R. Albers K.M. Davis B.M. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family members sensitize nociceptors in vitro and produce thermal hyperalgesia in vivo.J.

GFR alpha2/neurturin signalling regulates noxious heat transduction in isolectin B4-binding mouse sensory neurons.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is some evidence for a role of the GDNF family ligands neurturin and artemin in regulating noxious heat transduction by sensory neurons (Malin et al., 2006Malin S.A. Molliver D.C. Koerber H.R. Cornuet P. Frye R. Albers K.M. Davis B.M. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family members sensitize nociceptors in vitro and produce thermal hyperalgesia in vivo.J.

GFR alpha2/neurturin signalling regulates noxious heat transduction in isolectin B4-binding mouse sensory neurons.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GDNF signaling is however not required for survival of nociceptive sensory neurons (Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002Airaksinen M.S. Saarma M. The GDNF family: signalling, biological functions and therapeutic value.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, Luo et al., 2007Luo W. Wickramasinghe S.R.

In addition to the Trk and c-Ret receptors, sensory neurons are known to express other receptor tyrosine kinases like c-Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) (Hirata et al., 1993Hirata T. Morii E. Morimoto M. Kasugai T. Tsujimura T. Hirota S. Kanakura Y. Nomura S. Kitamura Y.

Rossant J. Reith A. Bernstein A. Contiguous patterns of c-kit and steel expression: analysis of mutations at the W and Sl loci.Development. 1991; 113: 1207-1221PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Kit/SCF signaling system has interested geneticists for almost a century: allelic mutations in SCF (Steel, Sl) or c-Kit (W) give rise to dominant white spotting pigment phenotypes (Little, 1915Little C.C. the inheritance of black-eyed white spotting in mice.Am. Nat. 1915; 49: 727-740Crossref Google Scholar), and their analysis provided the first genetic evidence for an essential function of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in mammalian development (Besmer, 1991Besmer P. The kit ligand encoded at the murine Steel locus: a pleiotropic growth and differentiation factor.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SCF/c-Kit signaling has diverse functions in the development of primordial germ cells, melanocytes, and hematopoietic lineages (mast cells and erythroid progenitors) (Besmer, 1991Besmer P. The kit ligand encoded at the murine Steel locus: a pleiotropic growth and differentiation factor.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The embryonic or perinatal lethality in mutants homozygous for loss-of-function Sl or W alleles has hampered the study of c-Kit/SCF signaling functions in the adult (Besmer, 1991Besmer P. The kit ligand encoded at the murine Steel locus: a pleiotropic growth and differentiation factor.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Reith et al., 1990Reith A.D. Rottapel R. Giddens E. Brady C. Forrester L. Bernstein A. W mutant mice with mild or severe developmental defects contain distinct point mutations in the kinase domain of the c-kit receptor.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the availability of inbred W mutant substrains, originally established during intensive inbreeding regimens to select for postnatal survival of homozygote mutants (Russell and Lawson, 1959Russell E. Lawson F.A. Selection and inbreeding for longevity of a lethal type.J. Hered. 1959; 50: 19-25Google Scholar), as well as transgenic approaches that rescue the hematopoietic defect in c-Kit mutants permit the generation of adult mice completely lacking c-Kit function (Waskow et al., 2002Waskow C. Paul S. Haller C. Gassmann M. Rodewald H.R. Viable c-Kit(W/W) mutants reveal pivotal role for c-kit in the maintenance of lymphopoiesis.Immunity. 2002; 17: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, nervous system phenotypes have not been reported in such animals. Here we define key functions of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit and its ligand SCF in peripheral pain and mechanosensation, using genetic and electrophysiological approaches. Our analysis reveals two distinctive roles for c-Kit signaling: (1) c-Kit provides a key input to regulate the heat sensitivity of nociceptors; (2) c-Kit signaling regulates the function of discrete types of mechanosensitive sensory neurons, and loss of c-Kit leads to mechanoreceptor hypersensitivity. Our finding that c-Kit is an essential regulator of nociceptor sensitivity identifies it as a potential new target for pain therapy. We first characterized the distribution and neurochemistry of c-Kit-positive neurons within the DRG using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Figure 1). We could detect c-Kit mRNA in about 20% of DRG neurons, primarily small-diameter putative nociceptors, as well as in a subpopulation of middle to large sized DRG neurons (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1B′). We employed double immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against c-Kit together with antibodies against other markers to define further the neurochemical phenotype of c-Kit-positive neurons. We found that around 80% of c-Kit+ neurons were of small size and positive for peripherin, which is a good marker of unmyelinated C-fibers (Goldstein et al., 1991Goldstein M.E. House S.B. Gainer H. NF-L and peripherin immunoreactivities define distinct classes of rat sensory ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1D′). The remaining 20% of c-Kit+ cells were somewhat larger and were positive for heavy chain neurofilament, which is characteristic of cells that are myelinated (Figures 1E, 1F, and 1F′). Thus, it appears that two populations of c-Kit+ cells exist, the majority being nociceptors and a smaller proportion being myelinated mechanoreceptors. Small-diameter nociceptors can be divided into two major neurochemical classes, those that express the NGF receptor TrkA and the pain-related neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP), and neurons that largely lack neuropeptides but express the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase. The latter subpopulation of nociceptors can also be defined by their cell-surface binding of the isolectin B4 (IB4) and expression of the ionotropic P2X3 receptor (Snider and McMahon, 1998Snider W.D. McMahon S.B. Tackling pain at the source: new ideas about nociceptors.Neuron. 1998; 20: 629-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). We found that among small-diameter sensory neurons c-Kit protein was largely restricted to the TrkA population. Thus, the majority of c-Kit+ sensory neurons (>95%) expressed TrkA (Figures 1G, 1H, and 1H′), while small numbers were positive for c-Ret (Figures 1I, 1J, and 1J′) or exhibited IB4 binding (Figures 1K, 1L, and 1L′). Consistent with this, most c-Kit+ neurons were peptidergic, as determined by coexpression of CGRP (Figures 1M, 1N, and 1N′) or SP (Figures 1O, 1P, and 1P′). We also found that more than half of the c-Kit+ cells expressed the cation channel TRPV1 or the purine receptor P2X3 (Figures 1Q, 1R, 1R′, 1S, 1T, and 1T′). Since many c-Kit+ neurons are P2X3 positive, they may be identical with an appreciable population of TrkA-positive neurons that also express P2X3 (Ramer et al., 2001Ramer M.S. Bradbury E.J. McMahon S.B. Nerve growth factor induces P2X(3) expression in sensory neurons.J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 864-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In summary,c-Kit defines a subpopulation of peptidergic TrkA+ neurons, predominantly small-diameter nociceptors, the majority of which express the TRPV1 and P2X3 ion channels. Since it was clear that a subpopulation of C-fiber nociceptors express the c-Kit receptor, we also asked if its ligand SCF is normally present in the skin of adult mice. We found specific immunoreactivity for SCF in the upper layers of the epidermis (Figure 1V), an area of the skin that is richly innervated by peptidergic C-fibers (Kruger et al., 1989Kruger L. Silverman J.D. Mantyh P.W. Sternini C. Brecha N.C. Peripheral patterns of calcitonin-gene-related peptide general somatic sensory innervation: cutaneous and deep terminations.J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 280: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of c-Kit prompted us to undertake a genetic analysis of its function in somatic sensation. We employed a mouse strain harboring the original dominant-spotting W allele, first recognized in the early 1900s by Durham (Durham, 1911Durham L.M. Further experiments on the inheritance of coat colour in mice.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1911; 6: 93-94Google Scholar) and defined genetically by Little as having a lethal effect when homozygous (Little, 1915Little C.C. the inheritance of black-eyed white spotting in mice.Am. Nat. 1915; 49: 727-740Crossref Google Scholar, Rifaat, 1954Rifaat O.M. White spotting in mice and rabbits.Genetica. 1954; 27: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This allele results from a point mutation in the 5′ intron splice donor site downstream of the exon encoding the transmembrane domain (Hayashi et al., 1991Hayashi S. Kunisada T. Ogawa M. Yamaguchi K. Nishikawa S. Exon skipping by mutation of an authentic splice site of c-kit gene in W/W mouse.Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Previous analyses of dominant-spotting mice have demonstrated that the W allele is a null (Nocka et al., 1990Nocka K. Tan J.C. Chiu E. Chu T.Y. Ray P. Traktman P. Besmer P. Molecular bases of dominant negative and loss of function mutations at the murine c-kit/white spotting locus: W37, Wv, W41 and W.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). We used a specific inbred substrain of the c-KitW/+ mouse line (WB-pedigree, Jackson Labs) established during an inbreeding procedure in which parental animals were selected on the basis of enhanced postnatal survival in their homozygous mutant c-KitW/W offspring (WA, WB, WC, and WD pedigrees, see also Russell and Lawson, 1959Russell E. Lawson F.A. Selection and inbreeding for longevity of a lethal type.J. Hered. 1959; 50: 19-25Google Scholar). Crosses between heterozygous c-KitW/+ mice from the WB strain of animals yielded a small proportion (6%) of viable c-KitW/W mutant mice surviving for longer than 4 weeks (Figure 2A). To increase further the number of adult c-KitW/W mutants, we used a transgenic rescue strategy to overcome the lethal anemia in c-KitW/W mutants. We crossed a transgenic mouse line overexpressing erythropoietin into the c-KitW/+ strain (Ruschitzka et al., 2000Ruschitzka F.T. Wenger R.H. Stallmach T. Quaschning T. de Wit C. Wagner K. Labugger R. Kelm M. Noll G. Rulicke T. et al.Nitric oxide prevents cardiovascular disease and determines survival in polyglobulic mice overexpressing erythropoietin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 11609-11613Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and the resulting progeny were then interbred, resulting in an increase in the proportion of surviving c-Kit mutants to 28%. We refer to mutant c-KitW/W and c-KitW/W;Epotg animals as c-Kit−/− in the rest of the manuscript. We first analyzed c-Kit−/− mice in behavioral tests of acute thermal and mechanical nociception. Mice lacking c-Kit function demonstrated a marked hypoalgesia to radiant heat stimuli, with an average increase of 40% for foot withdrawal latency compared to wild-type littermates (p < 0.001 unpaired t test) (Figure 2B). In contrast, in a test of mechanical nociception, the force threshold for foot withdrawal of c-Kit−/− mutants was decreased by on average 20% compared to control mice (p < 0.001 unpaired t test) (Figure 2B). Such altered responses to acute nociceptive stimuli may have several underlying causes, including neuronal loss or altered innervation patterns of the skin or dorsal spinal cord. We analyzed semithin sections and ultrathin electron micrographs of the saphenous nerve, a pure cutaneous nerve innervating the skin of the lower hindlimb, to determine the numbers of nonmyelinated (C-fibers) and myelinated (Aδ nociceptors and Aβ mechanoreceptors) axons. No major changes in the number of fibers in c-Kit−/− mutant animals were observed (Figures 3A and 3B; see below). In addition, immunohistological analyses of skin preparations revealed a normal innervation of the dermis, epidermis, and other target tissues (e.g., arterioles, muscle) in mutant mice (see Figure S1 available online). The c-KitW allele permits the detection of a mutant c-Kit protein, although this is expressed at lower levels than the normal gene product (Nocka et al., 1990Nocka K. Tan J.C. Chiu E. Chu T.Y. Ray P. Traktman P. Besmer P.

Paul S. Haller C. Gassmann M. Rodewald H.R. Viable c-Kit(W/W) mutants reveal pivotal role for c-kit in the maintenance of lymphopoiesis.Immunity. 2002; 17: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The neurochemical nature of c-Kit+ neurons in mutant mice was unchanged, except the proportion of c-Kit+ neurons expressing the purine-activated channel P2X3 was reduced in mutant mice (28% reduction, p < 0.001, unpaired t test) (Figure 3C). It has been shown that erythropoietin may itself have neuroprotective effects when administered to mice (Campana and Myers, 2003Campana W.M. Myers R.R. Exogenous erythropoietin protects against dorsal root ganglion apoptosis and pain following peripheral nerve injury.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, our anatomical analyses were carried out on both c-Kit−/− and c-Kit−/−;Epotg mice, and the counts of A-fiber and C-fiber axons were not different between animals with or without the Epotg (Figure S2A). These results suggest that erythropoietin overexpression has little influence on normal programmed cell death in the mouse. The lack of neuronal cell death and the normal innervation patterns of the skin and spinal cord suggested that the marked changes in acute pain behavior in c-Kit mutants were due to functional alterations in primary afferent nociceptors. We analyzed the physiological properties of individual sensory neurons of c-Kit−/− mutants using the isolated skin-nerve preparation. Due to the marked thermal hypoalgesia of c-Kit−/− mutant mice, we first focused on examining the response properties of noxious heat-sensitive polymodal nociceptors. We recorded from a total of 72 C-fiber nociceptors in control and c-Kit−/− mice and noted that the proportion of noxious heat-sensitive neurons (so called C-mechanoheat, CMH fibers) found in the mutant was not significantly altered compared to control (68% in c-Kit−/− compared to 72% in wild-type, see also Table S1). However, the CMH fibers recorded in c-Kit−/− mutants displayed a substantial reduction in their sensitivity to noxious heat (Figure 4A). This was reflected in a large reduction in the average spike rate of CMH fibers in c-Kit−/− mice in response to a standard heating stimulus of the receptive field (Figure 4B). The average number of spikes from CMH fibers in c-Kit mutants was 4.5-fold smaller than that found in wild-type neurons (mean spike count to the heat stimulus 14.1 ± 2.5 spikes in c-Kit−/− mutants compared to 65.9 ± 9.5 spikes in controls, p < 0.001 unpaired t test). Not only was the total response reduced, but the temperature threshold for the first and second spike was elevated by between 5°C and 7°C in c-Kit−/− mice compared to controls (Figure 4C). We then went on to examine the properties of C-fiber nociceptors in c-Kit+/− mice to test if the functional deficit in C-fibers is observed with c-Kit haploinsufficiency. Interestingly, we also observed a reduction in noxious heat sensitivity of CMH fibers in c-Kit+/− mice that was quantitatively indistinguishable from that observed in c-Kit−/− mice (Figures S3A and S3B). In cutaneous nerves, CMH fibers make up 60%–70% of all nociceptors, and so it was initially puzzling how deletion of the c-Kit receptor, which is expressed in around 20% of C-fibers, could lead to such a large reduction in the noxious heat sensitivity of CMH fibers. However, we found that when the distribution of the total heat response of individual units in control mice was plotted, around 47% of the units could be characterized as “high responders” (>60 spikes/stimulus) (Figure S3C). An analysis of the data from mice with c-Kit mutations revealed that the majority of these “high responder” CMH fibers were essentially absent. These data suggest that a subpopulation of “high responding” CMH fibers require c-Kit signaling to maintain their normally high sensitivity to noxious heat (Figure S3C). The reduction in CMH fiber noxious heat sensitivity that we observed in c-Kit−/− mice might conceivably arise as a result of the overexpression of erythropoietin in some of the mice examined. In order to control for this possibility, we made an extensive analysis of single C-fiber properties in c-Kit+/+;Epotg mice that had been derived from matings between Epotg and c-Kit+/− mice. However, we found that the physiological properties of CMH fibers, including spike rates and heat thresholds, were essentially identical to those found in c-Kit wild-type mice (Figures S2B and S2C). The spiking rates of C-fiber nociceptors and myelinated AM-fibers to a series of suprathreshold mechanical stimuli were not significantly altered (Figure 4D and data not shown). However, the median von Frey hair force (vFT) required to evoke spikes from myelinated AM fibers in c-Kit−/− mice was significantly lower than that found in controls (median vFT, 2.5 mN in c-Kit−/− mice compared to 3.6 mN in control, p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test see also Figure S4 and Table S1). The effect on AM mechanosensitivity might account for the observation that paw withdrawal threshold was lower in c-Kit−/− mice (Figure 2B). Thus far, our data did not show that c-Kit signaling in the adult animal is necessary for maintaining noxious heat sensitivity. For example, it is also feasible that SCF/c-Kit signaling during development sets the heat sensitivity of polymodal nociceptors. To address this issue, we used imatinib (also called STI571 and Gleevec/Glivec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals), which is a potent c-Kit receptor blocker. We treated mice with clinically effective doses of imatinib (0.1 mg/g administered subcutaneously) for 6"
https://openalex.org/W2150119709,"Human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are a family of 15 serine proteases mainly known for their biomarker utility in various neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Despite significant progress in understanding their clinical application, little is known about the activation mechanism(s) of this important family of enzymes. Emerging evidence indicates that KLKs are activated in a stepwise manner, which is a characteristic of proteolytic cascades. Thus far, KLK cascades have been implicated in semen liquefaction and skin desquamation. Many members of the KLK family have been reported to be active in seminal plasma and/or skin, suggesting their involvement in common proteolytic cascades. KLK14, in particular, is highly active and has recently been proposed as one of the key trypsin-like proteases involved in skin desquamation. This study aims to elucidate a probable cascade-mediated role of KLK14 by 1) examining KLK14-mediated cleavage of a heptapeptide library encompassing activation sites of the 15 KLKs and 2) verifying activation of certain candidate downstream targets of KLK14 (i.e. pro-KLK1, -KLK3, and -KLK11). Heptapeptides encompassing activation motifs of KLK2, -3, -5, and -11 were cleaved with a high (≥85%) cleavage efficiency. Activation of these candidates was confirmed using full-length recombinant proteins. Pro-KLK11, -KLK3, and -KLK1 were rapidly activated in a concentration-dependent manner. Pro-KLK3 regulation was bidirectional because activation was followed by inactivation via internal cleavage of active KLK3. We are proposing a putative cascade model, operating through multiple KLKs. Identification of novel members of such proteolytic cascades will aid in further defining mechanisms involved in seminal/skin homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2028949787,"Agonist-dependent activation of G protein-coupled receptors induces diversified receptor cellular and signaling properties. Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) are two endogenous ligands that activate adrenoceptor (AR) signals in a variety of physiological stress responses in animals. Here we use cardiomyocyte contraction rate response to analyze the endogenous beta(2)AR signaling induced by Epi or NE in cardiac tissue. The Epi-activated beta(2)AR induced a rapid contraction rate increase that peaked at 4 min after stimulation. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)AR induced a much slower contraction rate increase that peaked at 10 min after stimulation. Whereas both drugs activated beta(2)AR coupling to G(s) proteins, only Epi-activated receptors were capable of coupling to G(i) proteins. Subsequent studies showed that the Epi-activated beta(2)AR underwent a rapid phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and subsequent dephosphorylation on serine residues 355 and 356, which was critical for sufficient receptor recycling and G(i) coupling. In contrast, the NE-activated beta(2)ARs underwent slow GRK2 phosphorylation, receptor internalization and recycling, and failed to couple to G(i). Moreover, inhibiting beta(2)AR phosphorylation by betaARK C terminus or dephosphorylation by okadaic acid prevented sufficient recycling and G(i) coupling. Together, our data revealed that distinct temporal phosphorylation of beta(2)AR on serine 355 and 356 by GRK2 plays a critical role for dictating receptor cellular events and signaling properties induced by Epi or NE in cardiomyocytes. This study not only helps us understand the endogenous agonist-dependent beta(2)AR signaling in animal heart but also offers an example of how G protein-coupled receptor signaling may be finely regulated by GRK in physiological settings."
https://openalex.org/W2069075828,"JAM-C is an adhesion molecule that is expressed on cells within the vascular compartment and epithelial cells and, to date, has been largely studied in the context of inflammatory events. Using immunolabeling procedures in conjunction with confocal and electron microscopy, we show here that JAM-C is also expressed in peripheral nerves and that this expression is localized to Schwann cells at junctions between adjoining myelin end loops. Sciatic nerves from JAM-C-deficient [having the JAM-C gene knocked out (KO)] mice exhibited loss of integrity of the myelin sheath and defective nerve conduction as indicated by morphological and electrophysiological studies, respectively. In addition, behavioral tests showed motor abnormalities in the KO animals. JAM-C was also expressed in human sural nerves with an expression profile similar to that seen in mice. These results demonstrate that JAM-C is a component of the autotypic junctional attachments of Schwann cells and plays an important role in maintaining the integrity and function of myelinated peripheral nerves."
https://openalex.org/W2077375327,"Thrombin exosite 1 binds the predominant γA/γA-fibrin form with low affinity. A subpopulation of fibrin molecules, γA/γ′-fibrin, has an extended COOH terminus γ′-chain that binds exosite 2 of thrombin. Bivalent binding to γA/γ′-fibrin increases the affinity of thrombin 10-fold, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Because of its higher affinity, thrombin dissociates 7-fold more slowly from γA/γ′-fibrin clots than from γA/γA-fibrin clots. After 24 h of washing, however, both γA/γ′- and γA/γA-fibrin clots generate fibrinopeptide A when incubated with fibrinogen, indicating the retention of active thrombin. Previous studies demonstrated that heparin heightens the affinity of thrombin for fibrin by simultaneously binding to fibrin and exosite 2 on thrombin to generate a ternary heparin-thrombin-fibrin complex that protects thrombin from inhibition by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II. In contrast, dermatan sulfate does not promote ternary complex formation because it does not bind to fibrin. Heparin-catalyzed rates of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin were 5-fold slower in γA/γ′-fibrin clots than they were in γA/γA-fibrin clots. This difference reflects bivalent binding of thrombin to γA/γ′-fibrin because (a) it is abolished by addition of a γ′-chain-directed antibody that blocks exosite 2-mediated binding of thrombin to the γ′-chain and (b) the dermatan sulfate-catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II also is lower with γA/γ′-fibrin than with γA/γA-fibrin clots. Thus, bivalent binding of thrombin to γA/γ′-fibrin protects thrombin from inhibition, raising the possibility that γA/γ′-fibrin serves as a reservoir of active thrombin that renders thrombi thrombogenic.

Thrombin plays a critical role in coagulation (1Mann K.G. Butenas S. Brummel K. Arter. Throm. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As a potent procoagulant, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, activates platelets, and amplifies its own generation by activating upstream factors (f.) 2The abbreviations used are: f.factorChzchromozymeDSdermatan sulfateFPRD-Phe-Pro-ArgGPglycoproteinHCIIheparin cofactor IIIIathrombinRUresponse unitReqRU equilibriumSPRsurface plasmon resonancet½half time of dissociationYPRD-Tyr-Pro-Arg. V, VIII, and XI. The procoagulant activity of thrombin is tightly regulated by inhibitors and by effector molecules that redirect the activity of thrombin. Inhibition is mediated by antithrombin in a reaction that is accelerated by glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin or heparan sulfate. Thrombomodulin is an important thrombin effector located on the endothelial cell surface. Once bound, the substrate specificity of thrombin is altered such that it no longer functions as a procoagulant but instead serves as an activator of protein C and thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor, thereby initiating anticoagulant and anti-fibrinolytic pathways, respectively.

The exquisite substrate specificity of thrombin and its tight regulation result, at least in part, from the presence of two positively charged exosites that flank the active site (2Page M.J.

Exosite 1 is used for docking thrombin with its substrates, orienting the reactants such that the appropriate bonds are presented to the active site for cleavage. Exosite 1 also is used in the regulation of thrombin. Thus, the NH2 terminus of heparin cofactor II (HCII), a secondary inhibitor of thrombin, binds exosite 1 and this interaction renders HCII specific for thrombin (5Pike R.N. Buckle A.M. Le Bonniec B.F. Church F.C. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Exosite 1 also mediates thrombin binding to thrombomodulin. In contrast, exosite 2 mainly is used to tether thrombin to cells or other reactants. For example, exosite 2 mediates the binding of thrombin to GP 1bα on the platelet surface or to the chondroitin sulfate moiety of thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface (6De Candia E.

Heparin also utilizes exosite 2 to bind thrombin and to bridge it to antithrombin, thereby accelerating inhibition. The interaction of thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor with fibrin is exosite-mediated (8Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Pospisil C.H. Weitz J.I. Biophys.

However, a subset of fibrin molecules binds thrombin with 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than the bulk fraction (10Meh D.A. Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol.

These fibrin molecules, which possess a variant form of the γA-chain with an extended COOH terminus that is designated γ′, are termed γA/γ′ (12Wolfenstein-Todel C. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6146-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thrombin binds to this γ′-chain extension via exosite 2 (13Lovely R.S. Moaddel M. Farrell D.H. J. Thromb.

This occurs through the formation of a ternary heparin-thrombin-fibrin complex wherein thrombin binds γA/γA-fibrin via exosite 1 and heparin binds simultaneously to fibrin and to exosite 2 on thrombin, thereby bridging the thrombin to the fibrin (15Hogg P.J. Bock P.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol.

Formation of this ternary heparin-thrombin-fibrin complex protects thrombin from inactivation by antithrombin and HCII. This protection reflects the inability of the serpin-bound heparin molecule to bridge to thrombin because exosite 2 is occupied by the fibrin-bound heparin (17Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The extent of protection is greater for HCII than it is for antithrombin. This reflects the fact that, in addition to bridging of thrombin to HCII by heparin, the NH2 terminus of HCII must also bind to exosite 1, which is already occupied. The phenomenon of thrombin protection when bound to fibrin may explain the limited capacity of heparin to block fibrin accretion in venous thrombosis models and the recurrent ischemic events that occur despite heparin treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes (18Weitz J.I. Buller H.R. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Agnelli G. Sonaglia F. Haematologica. 2002; 87: 757-770PubMed Google Scholar). Both exosites of thrombin are engaged when the enzyme is incorporated within the ternary heparin-thrombin-fibrin complex. This bivalent binding protects thrombin from inhibition (17Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Likewise, both exosites also are occupied in the high affinity interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′-fibrin (14Pospisil C.H. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21584-21591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether thrombin bound to γA/γ′-fibrin is protected from inhibition by antithrombin and HCII. This is an important question because epidemiological studies suggest that elevated levels of γA/γ′-fibrinogen are a risk factor for thrombosis (20Lovely R.S. Falls L.A. Al Mondhiry H.A.

To begin to address this issue, we (a) used surface plasmon resonance to better elucidate the mode of binding of thrombin to γA/γA- and γA/γ′-fibrin, (b) examined the extent to which γA/γA- and γA/γ′-fibrin sequester thrombin and modulate its clotting activity, and (c) compared the capacity of γA/γA- and γA/γ′-fibrin to protect bound thrombin from inhibition by antithrombin and HCII.

After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 125I-YPR-thrombin was separated from unincorporated YPR and 125I by size exclusion chromatography on a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TS). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and aliquots were counted for radioactivity in a γ-counter. 125I-YPR-thrombin concentration was 7.1 μm, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm (23Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), with a specific radioactivity of 680,000 counts/min/μg protein. D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (FPR) (EMD Chemicals, Inc., San Diego, CA) modified thrombin was prepared as described (23Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol.

Fibrinogen Preparation—γA/γ′- and γA/γA-fibrinogen were isolated by fractionation of fibrinogen on a DEAE-Sepharose column (14Pospisil C.H. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 units/ml aprotinin. About 300 mg of fibrinogen was loaded onto a 2.5 × 20-cm DEAE-FF-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 39 mm Tris-phosphoric acid, pH 8.8 (buffer A). The column was developed with a concave gradient to 50% buffer B (500 mm Tris-phosphoric acid, pH 4) followed by a linear gradient to 100% B. Chromatography was performed using a high pressure liquid chromatography system (Beckman 32 Karat; Beckman-Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The two fractions of fibrinogen were pooled separately and precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. Fibrinogen pellets were washed twice with 25% ammonium sulfate and then resuspended in TS. The γA/γA-fibrinogen pool was diluted to 10 mg/ml and applied to a sheep anti-human f.XIIIa column. The eluate was again ammonium sulfate-precipitated and dissolved in TS. Preparations were verified to be free of f.XIIIa activity by examining thrombin-clotted samples for γ-γ dimers on SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Fibrinogen (γA/γ′ or γA/γA) or ovalbumin was bound to separate flow cells of a CM5 chip in a BIAcore 1000 using an amine coupling kit (BIAcore; GE Healthcare). Injection was continued until 7000 response units (RU) of fibrinogen or 2500 RU of ovalbumin was adsorbed. Flow cells were treated with 1 m ethanolamine and then washed with 20 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (HBS) buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Tween 20 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Flow cells were then treated with two injections of 300 μl of 100 nm thrombin at 5 μl/min to ensure complete conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Using saturating quantities of the γ′-peptide-directed antibody, 30% of the immobilized fibrin was determined to be in an accessible orientation. For binding studies, 20-μl aliquots of FPR-thrombin (0–5000 nm) were injected into the flow cells, followed by a 1-min wash to monitor dissociation. No regeneration of the flow cells between injections was necessary. Peak RU values (Req) were determined for each thrombin concentration and were corrected for the RU values with ovalbumin. Req values were converted to mass of FPR-thrombin, using the relation 1 pg = 1 RU (BIAtechnology Handbook; BIAcore). Moles of FPR-thrombin bound/mole of fibrin were calculated and plotted versus moles-free FPR-thrombin, and the data were analyzed by nonlinear regression of a one- or two-site rectangular hyperbola using TableCurve (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The results are reported as means ± S.E. of two determinations. The ability of the γ′-peptide to compete with γ-thrombin binding to γA/γ′-fibrin also was assessed by surface plasmon resonance. A CM5 chip with adsorbed γA/γ′-fibrin was prepared as described above. Aliquots of 5 μm γ-thrombin containing 0–25 μm γ′-peptide were injected, and Req values were determined. Inhibition Kinetics—Thrombin inhibition was determined in a continuous assay by monitoring residual thrombin activity within fibrin clots. Samples containing 400 nm antithrombin or HCII, 2.7 μm γA/γA-or γA/γ′-fibrinogen, 400 μm Chz-Th, and 1 μg/ml heparin or 5 μg/ml DS were prepared in a multiwell plate. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 2.5 units/ml Atroxin and 2.2 nm thrombin. Atroxin was used in addition to thrombin to ensure that both forms of fibrinogen clotted at a similar and rapid rate. The reactions were monitored at 405 and 450 nm in a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Clot formation occurred within 45 s. Absorbance values subsequent to this were analyzed with respect to time (t) by nonlinear regression analysis of the equation A = Vo/k1 × (1 – ek1 × t) + Ao to obtain k1, the apparent, pseudo first-order rate constant of inhibition (26Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where Vo is the initial reaction rate and Ao is the initial absorbance at 405 nm. The k1 value was multiplied by (1 + [Chz-Th]/Km) to correct for competition of the chromogenic substrate in the continuous assay, using a Km of 15 μm. The apparent second-order rate constant (k2,app) was obtained by dividing k1 by the inhibitor concentration. Thrombin Dissociation from Intact Fibrin Clots—Stock solutions consisting of 3 μm γA/γA-, γA/γ′-, or unfractionated fibrinogen in TS containing 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Tween 20 (TS-TwCa), and 50,000 counts/min of 125I-YPR-thrombin were prepared. 125-μl aliquots were added to microcentrifuge tubes, and clots were formed around truncated plastic inoculation loops (Bac-Loop; Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) by incubation with 100 nm thrombin for 30 min at 37 °C. The clots were then removed from the tubes and washed three times with TS for 5 min. After quantifying radioactivity with a γ-counter, clots were suspended in 5 ml of TSTwCa in 50-ml conical tubes and incubated with gentle agitation for 24 h at 23 °C. A parallel series of clots were incubated in TS-TwCa containing 2 m NaCl to account for nonspecific binding. At intervals, clots were removed into 0.5 ml of the bathing buffer and the radioactivity was determined. The fraction of 125I-YPR-thrombin remaining in the clot at each time point was calculated as a percent of the initial amount, and time courses were fit to a two-phase exponential decay curve with zero end point to determine the rates of dissociation. The two phases reflect rapid dissociation of the unbound, fluid fraction of thrombin and the slower dissociation of the fibrin-bound fraction. The residual thrombin activity of the washed clots was determined by measuring their capacity to release fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen. After incubation for 24 h, clots were washed twice for 5 min in TSTwCa and their radioactivity was determined. Each clot was then placed in a tube containing 500 μl of a 3-μm solution of unfractionated fibrinogen in TS-TwCa buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. At intervals, 50-μl aliquots were removed into tubes containing 150 μl of cold 100% ethanol. After vortexing, the tubes were maintained on ice until processed. Fibrinogen was pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 4 min), and the supernatants were removed and dried in a Speedvac (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) overnight. The samples were then reconstituted to their original volume with water and assayed for fibrinopeptide A by radioimmunoassay, as previously described (27Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Thrombin Binding to γA/γA- and γA/γ′-Fibrin—To better elucidate the nature of the enhanced affinity of thrombin for γA/γ′-fibrin, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used. γA/γA-or γA/γ′-fibrinogen was immobilized in separate flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip. Flow cells were treated with 100 nm thrombin to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. Ovalbumin adsorbed to a separate flow cell served as a control. Successively higher concentrations of FPR-α-thrombin or FPR-γ-thrombin were injected into the flow cells, followed by a dissociation step after each run. After the experiment, Req values were determined by the instrument software. Values were corrected for background signal in the ovalbumin flow cell, and the data were plotted against the input thrombin concentration (Fig. 1). Prior determination of the amount of fibrinogen adsorbed with the γ′-peptide-directed antibody permitted calculation of stoichiometries of interaction. The binding of α-thrombin to γA/γA-fibrin occurred via a single site with a Kd of 3.4 ± 0.5 μm and a molar stoichiometry of 2.9 ± 0.5 thrombin/fibrin. This Kd value is comparable with the value of 2.3 μm obtained for binding of thrombin to intact γA/γA-fibrin clots (14Pospisil C.H. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21584-21591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry likely reflects the dimeric nature of the fibrin molecule. In contrast, binding of α-thrombin to immobilized γA/γ′-fibrin was mediated by two sites with Kd values of 11 ± 0.8 and 1100 ± 290 nm, respectively. These values are in agreement with Kd values of 100 and 1500 nm reported for the respective high and low affinity sites on intact γA/γ′-fibrin clots (14Pospisil C.H. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21584-21591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The molar stoichiometry of the higher affinity site was 0.5 ± 0.1 thrombin/fibrin, whereas that of the lower affinity site was 3.4 ± 0.5. The lower stoichiometry of the higher affinity binding site may reflect the presence of only one γ′-chain in the γA/γ′-fibrin molecule. γ-thrombin was used in place of α-thrombin to reveal the role of exosite 1 in binding fibrin. For γ-thrombin binding to γA/γ′-fibrin, a single binding site with a Kd of 9 μm and a molar stoichiometry of 1 was observed (Fig. 1). No binding of γ-thrombin to γA/γA-fibrin was detected. In a subsequent experiment, a synthetic peptide analog of the COOH-terminal sequence of the γ′-chain abrogated binding of γ-thrombin to γA/γ′-fibrin (Fig. 2). The Kd value of the γ′-peptide for γ-thrombin determined from this experiment is 3.8 μm, comparable with the value of 1.0 μm obtained in direct binding experiments (14Pospisil C.H. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21584-21591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These data confirm that thrombin binding to the γ′-chain of fibrin is mediated solely by exosite 2. Although the binding parameters determined by SPR are comparable with those obtained in fibrin clots, fibrin on the SPR biosensor chips is likely monomeric, whereas that in intact clots is polymeric. This is relevant to the interaction of thrombin with γA/γ′-fibrin because it is hypothesized that the higher affinity binding results from interaction with two adjacent fibrin monomers within the protofibril (8Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Pospisil C.H. Weitz J.I. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 112: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fibrin monomers would not be expected to polymerize when adsorbed to the carboxydextran surface of the biosensor chip. However, the carboxydextran matrix may serve as a spacer that renders bound fibrin molecules sufficiently mobile such that thrombin can bridge individual fibrin monomers. Thrombin-mediated bridging would remain sensitive to exosite antagonists, consistent with the results obtained here. Further support for this type of interaction comes from the observation that antibodies, because of their bivalent nature, have been observed to bridge immobilized antigen in SPR experiments (28Luo J. Zhou J. Zou W. Shen P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the SPR data presented here are consistent with those observed using fibrin clots (14Pospisil C.H. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21584-21591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Dissociation of Thrombin from Fibrin Clots—Both intact clot and SPR analyses reveal that γA/γ′-fibrin has higher affinity for α-thrombin than γA/γA-fibrin. However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon translates into greater retention of thrombin by γA/γ′-fibrin clots than by γA/γA-fibrin clots. To address this, fibrin clots formed around plastic loops were immersed in buffer, and dissociation of 125I-YPR-thrombin from the clots was monitored over time (Fig. 3). Intact, three-dimensional clots were used in these experiments to model dissociation of thrombin from thrombi. Control experiments, performed in the presence of 2 m NaCl, demonstrated that there was minimal nonspecific binding of 125I-YPR-thrombin to the fibrin clots (open symbols). Dissociation of 125I-YPR-thrombin from γA/γA-fibrin clots was rapid and reached 83% after 24 h. In contrast, only 25% of 125I-YPR-thrombin dissociated from γA/γ′-fibrin clots in the same time period. Retention of fibrin binding ligands in clots is determined by two parameters, diffusion in the fluid phase and binding with the fibrin phase (29Diamond S.L. Anand S. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2622-2643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data were analyzed using a two-phase exponential decay model (lines), where the rates reflect macroscopic dissociation from the intact clot. The first phase demonstrated a rapid rate of thrombin dissociation from all three forms of fibrin with a half-life (t½) of 1–2 h. This rate was comparable with that obtained in the presence of 2 m NaCl and reflects macroscopic dissociation of the unbound fraction of thrombin from the fluid phase of the clot. The second phase reflects retarded diffusion due to thrombin adsorption by fibrin. This phase yielded a slower rate of dissociation with a t½ of thrombin dissociation from γA/γA-fibrin clots of 13.9 h. The t½ value of the slow phase of thrombin dissociation was 3.3-fold longer from unfractionated fibrin clots and 7.1-fold longer from γA/γ′-fibrin clots. It is notable that thrombin dissociation from clots prepared from unfractionated fibrinogen, which contain only ∼10% γA/γ′-fibrin, more closely resembled that from γA/γ′-fibrin clots. These data reveal that γA/γ′-fibrin clots retain thrombin more avidly than do γA/γA-fibrin clots and that the presence of even small amounts of γA/γ′-fibrin slows the rate of dissociation of thrombin. Although γA/γ′-fibrin clots retain more thrombin, both exosites are engaged in its interaction with this form of fibrin. Consequently, it is unclear whether thrombin bound to γA/γ′-fibrin clots retains catalytic activity against macromolecular substrates. To address this, thrombin activity of clots that had been washed for 24 h was determined by immersing them in fibrinogen-containing buffer for 30 min and monitoring fibrinopeptide A generation over this time period. Fibrinogen cleavage, rather than chromogenic activity, was determined so that the availability of exosite 1 of clot-associated thrombin could be assessed. Although γA/γ′-fibrin clots retained more thrombin than γA/γA-fibrin clots, the extent of fibrinopeptide A cleavage was similar with the two types of clots (Fig. 4). This likely reflects the fact that fibrin-bound thrombin is unable to cleave fibrinogen. Therefore, by virtue of the lower affinity interaction, thrombin associated with γA/γA-fibrin is more accessible to fibrinogen than that associated with γA/γ′-fibrin. Consequently, thrombin associated with unfractionated fibrin clots had greater fibrinogen cleaving activity than that associated with either individual form of fibrin because unfractionated fibrin clots contain more thrombin than γA/γA-fibrin clots. These data demonstrate that thrombin bound to fibrin clots remains active but that higher affinity binding to γA/γ′-fibrin clots reduces the capacity of thrombin to release fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen. Protection of Thrombin from Inhibition by Binding to γA/γ′-Fibrin—Fibrin-bound thrombin is resistant to heparin-catalyzed inactivation by antithrombin and HCII (16Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C.

The scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (cav1) can inhibit the activity of TGF-β, perhaps by forming membrane invaginations that enfold TGF-β receptors. The study goals were 1) to evaluate how allergen challenge affects lung expression of cav1 and the density of caveolae in vivo 2) to determine whether reduced cav1 expression is mediated by interleukin (IL)-4 and 3) to measure the effects of decreased expression of cav1 on TGF-β signaling. C57BL/6J, IL-4-deficient mice, and cav1-deficient mice, sensitized by intraperitoneal injections of phosphate-buffered saline or ovalbumin (OVA) at days 0 and 12, received intranasal phosphate-buffered saline or OVA challenges at days 24, 26, and 28. Additionally, another group of C57BL/6J mice received IL-4 by intratracheal instillation for 7 days. We confirmed that the OVA-allergen challenge increased eosinophilia and T-helper type 2-related cytokine levels (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage. Allergen challenge reduced lung cav1 mRNA abundance by 40%, cav1 protein by 30%, and the number of lung fibroblast caveolae by 50%. Administration of IL-4 in vivo also substantially decreased cav1 expression. In contrast, the allergen challenge did not decrease cav1 expression in IL-4-deficient mice. The reduced expression of cav1 was associated with activation of TGF-β signaling that was further enhanced in OVA-sensitized and challenged cav1-deficient mice. This study demonstrates a previously unknown modulation of TGF-β signaling by IL-4, via cav1, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for controlling the effects of TGF-β and thereby ameliorating pathological airway remodeling.

Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 23Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 can be prevented by caveolin-1 (cav1), one of three members of the caveolin protein family (24Razani B. Zhang X.L. Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Bottinger E.P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6727-6738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Cav1 plays a crucial role in the formation of caveolae, 50-100-nm wide omega-shaped plasma membrane invaginations that are found in fibroblasts, muscle cells, capillary endothelium, and type I pneumocytes (25Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Within caveolae, cav1 modulates many signaling proteins, including those in the TGF-β pathway (26Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The scaffolding domain (residues 82-101) of cav1 confers this regulation by binding and releasing these proteins in a controlled fashion (26Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the effects of cytokines, released during allergic inflammation, may regulate the expression and function of cav1 and thereby indirectly affect the signaling and pathological effects of TGF-β. We used a mouse model of airway inflammation to establish that allergic modulation of cav1 expression is mediated by IL-4. Intratracheal instillation of IL-4 results in cav1 down-regulation in contrast to no change in cav1 expression in allergen-challenged IL-4-deficient mice. We then showed that TGF-β signaling is exaggerated by this IL-4-activating allergen challenge in cav1-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Mice—C57Bl/6J, C57Bl/6-IL-4tmlNmt/J (IL-4-deficient), C.129S2-Stat6tm1Gru/J (STAT6-deficient), and Cavtm1Mls/J (cav1-deficient) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The genetic background for the cav1 knock-out mice is a mixture of C57BL/6J and 129S6/SvEv. The resulting chimeric animals were then crossed to C57BL/6J mice for six generations. The animal experiments were conducted using a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Hawaii. Cell Isolation and Culture—Mouse lung fibroblasts were extracted from C57Bl/6J, Cavtm1Mls/J, and C.129S2-Stat6tm1Gru/J mice. Lung tissues were digested with 0.0025% Trypsin (Invitrogen) and 1 mg/ml collagenase type I (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, l-glutamine, and pyridoxine hydrochloride (Invitrogen) and incubated with stirring in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The digestion medium was removed, and the cells were placed into 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The digestion was repeated on the remaining tissue for a total of three digestion cycles. The cell suspension was filtered through one thickness of sterile gauze and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, counted with a hemocytometer, and plated at 50,000 cells/cm2. Lung fibroblasts were used at confluence and between passages 3 and 5. The cells were treated for 48 h with 10 ng/ml of recombinant IL-4 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and/or 2 ng/ml of TGF-β (Sigma) or anti IL-4 antibody (catalog number AF-204NA; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Allergen Challenge and Intratracheal Instillation of IL-4—Female 8-week old C57BL/6J (C57), IL-4-deficient, and cav1-deficient (cav1Δ) mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injections on days 0 and 12 with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, negative control) or 50 μg of OVA (Sigma-Aldrich) adsorbed onto 0.5 mg of alum in 200 μl of PBS (n = 10 to 15 mice per group). Mice were challenged with intranasal administration of 50 μl of either PBS or OVA (0.4 mg/ml) on days 24, 26, and 28 under brief isofluorane anesthesia. On day 29, the mice were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture, and BAL was performed. Right lung tissue was used for histology and electron microscopy, and left lung tissue was reserved for RNA and protein extraction. To test whether cav1 regulation was mediated by IL-4, female 8-week-old C57 mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine prior to intratracheal inoculation with PBS or IL-4 (Prepro Tech, Rocky Hill, NJ)/anti-IL-4 (gift from Dr. Finkelman, University of Cincinnati) as described by Perkins et al. (27Perkins C. Wills-Karp M. Finkelman F.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 118: 410-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). BAL fluid, blood, RNA, and protein extracts were analyzed for cytokine levels, complete blood count, and mRNA abundance or immunoassay of TGF-β and connective tissue proteins, respectively. Eosinophil Count, Cytokine Levels in BAL Fluid, and Serum OVA-specific IgE Level—Following intratracheal injection with 1 ml of PBS, BAL fluid was collected from each mouse and centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 20 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was stored at -80 °C until tested for cytokine levels. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS to determine cell counts. Cytospin preparations were made with a maximum of 2.5 × 105 cells/slide using a Shandon Cytospin centrifuge (Shandon Lipshaw Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Eosinophil counts were performed as described previously (28Ikeda R.K. Nayar J. Cho J.Y. Miller M. Rodriguez M. Raz E. Broide D.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IL-4 and IL-5 levels were measured in BAL fluid using mouse Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit Cytometric Bead Array™ (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IL-13 levels were measured using IL-13 Quantikine ELISA™ (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). TGF-β1 content of BAL fluid was measured using mouse/rat/porcine TGF-β1 Quantikine ELISA™ (R&D Systems catalog number MB100). Each sample was directly measured for active TGF-β1. In addition, each sample was treated with acetic acid/urea and NaOH/HEPES according to the manufacturer's protocol, to activate latent TGF-β1 to the immunoreactive form, allowing measurement of the total amount of TGF-β1 in the samples. Gene and Protein Expression—Total RNA was extracted from cell or tissue samples using the RNeasy™ kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were treated with 0.05 unit/ml of DNase I (Qiagen) at 20 °C for 15 min. Total RNA (5 μg) was converted into first strand cDNA using random hexamers (SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR™; Invitrogen). The level of expression of cav1 was detected by semi-quantitative real time PCR using commercially available cav1 primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems). Total protein was extracted by homogenizing 0.5 g of frozen lung tissues on ice in 10 ml of CellLytic MT buffer (Sigma) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and 5 mm EDTA. Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and protein concentrations in supernatants were determined by the Bradford assay (Bradford reagent; Bio-Rad). Total protein (60 μg) was combined with reducing Laemmli buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, cooled on ice, and loaded into wells of a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with primary antibodies including anti-cav1 (RDI-caveol1abm, Fitzgerald, Concord, MA), anti-Smad2 (51-1300; Zymed Laboratories, Inc. San Francisco, CA), and anti-p-Smad2 (3104; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Appropriate ECL-peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). For densitometry, digital images of autoradiographic film were captured using Gel Logic 200 and Kodak MI software (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, Rochester, NY). This software was used to measure the mean intensity from regions of interest corresponding to bands (e.g. cav1) to be measured. The intensity of the target bands was normalized to that of the β-actin band to obtain a relative level of proteins of interest on an unsaturated exposure. Electron Microscopy—Right middle lobe lung tissue or cell culture samples were fixed by immersion in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.35. The fixed samples were then washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in LX-112 epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (70-80 nm) were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, viewed, and digitally photographed on a LEO912 EFTEM at 100 kV. For each sample, at least 70 sections were counted by investigators blinded to the identity of the sections, and the number of caveolae was reported per nm of cell membrane (ImageJ software, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gene expression is often regulated by IL-4 through a STAT6-dependent mechanism. To demonstrate that the STAT-6 binding element of the cav1 promoter binds STAT6 in vivo, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation according to a standard protocol (29Kuo M. Allis C. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) with modifications. Mouse lung tissues (25 mg) were incubated in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixation was stopped by dilution with glycine (0.125 m). The cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated in 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture for 15 min at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 rpm, and the pellets were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in 50 mm HEPES, 2.5% glycerol, 410 mm NaCl, 0.03 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. The pellets were resuspended in chromatin immunoprecipitation sonication buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The soluble chromatin was sonicated (10-15 pulses at 5-s/pulse) to shear the genomic DNA. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-p-STAT6 antibody (Upstate, Temecula, CA) or with normal rabbit IgG (noAb). Cross-linking was reversed in the immunoprecipitated complexes by incubation in 200 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 12 h with proteinase K treatment (150 μg/ml). PCR was performed on the immunoprecipitated complexes for the detection of the cav1 promoter using forward primer 5′-TCCACTGAAGGACCTTTCCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGAGATATTTGCTTCGAGGCC-3′. These primers specifically amplified the 137-bp region containing the putative STAT6-binding site within the cav1 promoter. The samples were quantified by semi-quantitative real time PCR in duplicate from four independent immunoprecipitations. The 137-bp PCR fragment containing the putative STAT6-binding site in cav1 promoter was end-labeled using the Biotin 3′ end DNA labeling kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. The nucleo-protein binding was done in 11 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 ng/μl Poly(dI·dC). 2.5 or 5 μg of nuclear lysate was incubated with the radiolabeled probe for 30 min at 25 °C. For the oligonucleotide competition experiments, the extracts were preincubated with various amounts of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide on ice for 20 min before the radiolabeled probe was added. The following competitors were used in these experiments: Putative STAT6 binding site on cav1 promoter, 5′-TTCTACGTTTTTCCCTAGAACAGAATCCTAA-3′ and 5′-TTAGGATTCTGTTCTAGGGAAA AACGTAGAA-3′ and STAT6 consensus binding site as previously described (30Gray M.J. Poljakovic M. Kepka-Lenhart D. Morris Jr., S.M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 353: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) 5′-GATCTTTCTTATGAAC-3′, and 5′-GATCGTTCATAAGAAA-3′. TGF-β Signaling Pathway Activation—The activation of the TGF-β pathway was evaluated by measuring the level of expression of p-Smad2 (Western blot) in vivo and by measuring the level of expression of the luciferase gene reporter under the regulation of Smad response element in vitro (plasmid provided by Dr. Aristidis Moustakas, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Mouse fibroblasts were extracted from lung tissue and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using the GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by the manufacturer. The cells were harvested for luciferase activity assays after a 24-h incubation period. For luciferase activity assays, a Turner Designs Luminometer model TD-20/20 genetic reporter system (Sunnyvale, CA) was used. Evaluation of Fibrosis—Lung tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, embedded in paraffin, and stained with trichrome stain. All of the samples were processed as a batch under identical conditions. Scoring was performed by investigators blinded to the coding of the samples. Two grading scales were established prior to the observation of the lung sections under 200× power. The grading scale for trichrome stain observed around the airways and blood vessels was as follows: 1 indicates a marginal peribronchial and perivascular blue trichrome stain; 2 indicates a slight increase in peribronchial and/or perivascular trichrome stain; 3 indicates an increase in trichrome stain in all airways and all vessels; and 4 indicates dramatically increased stain in all airways and vessels. We used the following grading scale for parenchymal fibrosis: 0 indicates no to marginal stain; 1 indicates slight and consistent increase; 2 indicates increased, uniform stain throughout the parenchyma; and 3 indicates, dramatic increase. The final score for each sample reflected the grading using both scales. Statistical Analysis—The results were expressed as the means ± S.D. A two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance between compared groups. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Data entry, management, and statistical analysis were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To determine whether cav1 participates in airway remodeling based on its potential interaction with the TGF-β signaling pathway, we studied cav1 expression and caveolae in the well established OVA-allergen challenge model (31Shinagawa K. Kojima M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). OVA-Allergen Challenge Causes an Inflammatory Response Associated with Reduced Expression of cav1—We confirmed the expected pulmonary inflammation in the OVA-sensitized and challenged mice in our experiments by comparing various inflammatory parameters in these samples to PBS-treated control mice. After allergen exposure, BAL cell count increased 4-fold (significantly different from baseline, p < 0.01). One-week of OVA-allergen challenge caused a BAL eosinophilia (p < 0.001, n ≥ 10; Table 1). In addition, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels were increased in BAL fluid from OVA-sensitized and challenged mice, (p < 0.001, n ≥ 10; Table 1).TABLE 1Eosinophils, Th2 cytokines, and TGF-β level in BAL of PBS- or OVA-challenged C57, IL-4-deficient, and cav1-deficient mice or PBS or IL-4 intratrachaelly injected C57.StrainTreatmentEosinophilIL-4IL-5IL-13TGF-β%pg/mlpg/mlpg/mlpg/mlC57PBS5.6 ± 1.91.3 ± 0.54 ± 15.1 ± 1.276 ± 42C57OVA59.7 ± 615.6 ± 4.6265 ± 163265 ± 77738 ± 159C57PBS II0.9 ± 0.614 ± 104.4 ± 3.63.8 ± 3.7285 ± 232C57IL-4 II43 ± 2288 ± 844.8 ± 36.2158 ± 661,142 ± 470IL-4PBS02.8 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.51.4 ± 20IL-4OVA2.1 ± 2.15.8 ± 2.93.4 ± 0.24.3 ± 3.491 ± 50cav1ΔPBS0.74 ± 0.311.6 ± 0.72.5 ± 1.110.6 ± 1.9284 ± 94cav1ΔOVA56.7 ± 5.419.7 ± 7.399.3 ± 33.1278 ± 86920 ± 121 Open table in a new tab We then investigated the expression of cav1 and formation of caveolae. As determined by qPCR, the amount of cav1 mRNA in the lung of OVA-sensitized and challenged animals was reduced by 40% compared with PBS-sensitized and challenged mice (p < 0.001). Western blot assays showed a decrease in cav1 protein (30% reduction, p < 0.05), which corresponded to a decreased number of caveolae, as observed by transmission electron microscopy (50% reduction, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). In addition, a group of eight C57 females was sensitized with OVA and challenged with PBS, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The inflammatory response (BAL eosinophilia, Th2-related cytokine levels) and the level of cav1 expression were similar to those measured in PBS-sensitized and challenged mice. Therefore, we did not further include these OVA-sensitized, PBS-challenged mice in our analysis. IL-4 Down-regulates the Expression of cav1—A 2,600-bp promoter region of the murine cav1 gene was analyzed with the TRANSFACT and MATINSPECTOR transcription factor data bases (www.genomatrix.de and transfac.gbf.de). The in silico analysis revealed several STAT family binding sites (STAT3 at -2,351 to -2,333 bp, STAT6 at -1,880 to -1,861 bp, and STAT5 at -1,221 to -1,202 bp). Both STAT3 and STAT5 are activated by a wide variety of cytokines, growth factors, and other stimuli. STAT6 is the primary signal transducer specifically activated in response to IL-4 or IL-13 stimulation (32Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). We first analyzed whether cav1 expression was mediated by IL-4 or IL-13. Lung fibroblasts were treated with IL-4, IL-13, and anti-IL-4 receptor α antibody. In vitro studies indicated that cav1 gene was IL-4-mediated and not IL-13-mediated (Fig. 2, A and B). We then investigated the in vivo regulation of cav1 gene expression in C57 mice receiving intratracheal IL-4 and in allergen-challenged IL-4-deficient mice. After seven daily inoculations, we measured an expected increase in total cell count (3.8 ± 2 × 105 versus 0.5 ± 0 × 105 cell/ml), eosinophils, IL-4, IL-13, and TGF-β level in BAL fluid of IL-4-treated mice, compared with PBS-treated animals (Table 1). Cav1 mRNA and cav1 protein levels were reduced by 40% in the lungs of mice treated with intratracheal instillation of IL-4, compared with control mice (n = 6) (Fig. 1). By contrast, the abundance of cav1 mRNA was not diminished in OVA-sensitized and challenged IL-4-deficient mice compared with PBS-sensitized and challenged mice (n = 3-6) (Fig. 1). As expected IL-4-deficient mice did not develop a strong immune response after allergen challenge (Table 1). Given the known association between STAT6-dependent pathways and IL-4, we sought to determine whether STAT6 binds to the cav1 promoter in vivo, as a possible mechanism for IL-4 regulation of cav1 transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-phospho-STAT6 antibody (anti-p-STAT6) on chromatin fragments extracted from mouse lungs that had been previously stimulated with IL-4, PBS, or OVA. DNA precipitated with anti-p-STAT6 yielded PCR-amplified cav1 promoter fragments (Fig. 2C). Anti-p-STAT6 immunoprecipitated chromatin from lungs of STAT6-deficient mice did not reveal PCR amplification of the cav1 promoter. 3.4- and 24-fold enrichment of cav1 promoter fragment was measured by qPCR in the IL-4-stimulated and in OVA-sensitized and challenged samples, respectively, compared with PBS-control lung tissues. STAT6 specifically bound to the cav1 promoter in vivo in response to IL-4 treatment and OVA-allergen challenge. To confirm binding of STAT6 to the cav1 promoter, electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments were conducted. Incubati"
https://openalex.org/W2061695953,"Proton-translocating ATPases are central to biological energy conversion. Although eukaryotes contain specialized F-ATPases for ATP synthesis and V-ATPases for proton pumping, eubacteria and archaea typically contain only one enzyme for both tasks. Although many eubacteria contain ATPases of the F-type, some eubacteria and all known archaea contain ATPases of the A-type. A-ATPases are closely related to V-ATPases but simpler in design. Although the nucleotide-binding and transmembrane rotor subunits share sequence homology between A-, V-, and F-ATPases, the peripheral stalk is strikingly different in sequence, composition, and stoichiometry. We have analyzed the peripheral stalk of Thermus thermophilus A-ATPase by using phage display-derived single-domain antibody fragments in combination with electron microscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the existence of two peripheral stalks in the A-ATPase, each one composed of heterodimers of subunits E and G arranged symmetrically around the soluble A(1) domain. To our knowledge, this is the first description of phage display-derived antibody selection against a multi-subunit membrane protein used for purification and single particle analysis by electron microscopy. It is also the first instance of the derivation of subunit stoichiometry by tandem mass spectrometry to an intact membrane protein complex. Both approaches could be applicable to the structural analysis of other membrane protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2013889053,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the protein dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, is unique among ATP-binding cassette transporters in that it functions as an ion channel. In CFTR, ATP binding opens the channel, and its subsequent hydrolysis causes channel closure. We studied the conformational changes in the pore-lining sixth transmembrane segment upon ATP binding by measuring state-dependent changes in accessibility of substituted cysteines to methanethiosulfonate reagents. Modification rates of three residues (resides 331, 333, and 335) near the extracellular side were 10–1000-fold slower in the open state than in the closed state. Introduction of a charged residue by chemical modification at two of these positions (resides 331 and 333) affected CFTR single-channel gating. In contrast, modifications of pore-lining residues 334 and 338 were not state-dependent. Our results suggest that ATP binding induces a modest conformational change in the sixth transmembrane segment, and this conformational change is coupled to the gating mechanism that regulates ion conduction. These results may establish a structural basis of gating involving the dynamic rearrangement of transmembrane domains necessary for vectorial transport of substrates in ATP-binding cassette transporters.

Despite their diverse functions, they share a common basic architecture comprised of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that function as a pathway for the permeation of substrates and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The highly conserved NBDs are the molecular motors that transform the chemical potential energy of ATP into conformational changes that drive substrate molecules through the TMDs (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical, structural, and genetic studies have led to a common mechanism in which ATP binding and hydrolysis induce the formation and dissociation of an NBD dimer, respectively. This regulated switch induces conformational changes in the TMDs to mediate vectorial transport of substrates across cell membranes (2Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 3Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

However, the structural bases for the propagation of conformational changes in the NBDs to the TMDs, and the conformational changes in TMDs are not well understood.Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C member 7), the product of the cystic fibrosis gene, is unique among ABC transporters in that its TMDs provide a conductive channel for anions. Phosphorylation of serines in the regulatory domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase activates CFTR (see Fig. 1A). Once phosphorylated, ATP-induced dimerization of NBDs opens the channel, and their subsequent dissociation upon ATP hydrolysis closes the channel (5Gadsby D.C. Vergani P. Csanady L. Nature. 2006; 440: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Despite extensive biochemical, structural, and functional studies, the nature of conformational changes in TMDs associated with CFTR channel gating remains elusive.The structure of the pore of CFTR is poorly understood. It is not known how many of the predicted 12 transmembrane segments contribute to formation of the pore. Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that the sixth transmembrane segment (TM6) in TMD1 plays a key role in the pore structure and determining its functional properties (6Dawson D.C.

We have investigated the structure of TM6 and probed for its conformational changes during channel gating using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (13Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Each residue in and flanking TM6 (amino acids 325–353) was replaced individually with cysteines, and the rates of modification by water-soluble thiol-reactive reagents were assessed in different channel gating states. State-dependent differences in the effects of Cd2+ and reactivities of sulfhydryl reagents were interpreted as reflecting changes in the local environment and accessibility of the substituted cysteines to the aqueous phase. During channel opening, there is a structural rearrangement in TM6 that results in decreased accessibility of three residues near the extracellular end to the aqueous phase. This conformational change is local, because it does not affect nearby porelining residues, and furthermore, it is required for the channel to open. These results establish a structural basis for CFTR gating involving ATP-induced conformational changes in TMDs, which may be relevant for other members of the ABC transporter family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology–Mutations were constructed in pSP-CFTR (14Hasegawa H. Skach W. Baker O. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V. Verkman A.S. Science. 1992; 258: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) plasmid containing the cDNA of human CFTR, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Each cDNA was linearized and transcribed using a SP6 promoter based in vitro transcription method (Ambion, Austin, TX). For channel expression, Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNA, stored at 18 °C, and used for recordings 2–5 days after injection. All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.Electrophysiology–Conventional two-electrode voltage-clamp methods were used to measure membrane currents in CFTR expressing oocytes, using an OC-725C oocyte clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments) connected to a computer via an ITC-18 interface (Instrutech Corp, Elmont, NY). Single oocytes were placed in a chamber (25 μl of volume) containing LCa96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, by NaOH) and continuously perfused at the rate of 1.5 ml/min. Pulse software (HEKA Electronics, Inc.) was used to ramp the applied transmembrane potential (Vm) at regular intervals. Vm was clamped at -20 mV in between the voltage ramps. Transmembrane current (Im) and Vm were digitized at 50 Hz during the voltage ramps and written directly onto hard disk. In data analysis with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) software, a fifth order polynomial was fitted to the raw, monotonically increasing Im - Vm data from each voltage ramp. The whole oocyte membrane conductance and the reversal potential (Vrev) were evaluated simultaneously as the slope (dIm/dVm) and the x-intercept of the polynomial, respectively.CFTR channels were stimulated by external application of forskolin (10 μm) and IBMX (1 mm or 20 μm) in LCa96. Vm was ramped from -60 to 20 mV in 5 s and repeated at 10-s intervals, and the change in conductance was evaluated at -20 mV. In experiments designed to measure kinetics, Vm was ramped from -40 to 0 mV in 950 ms and repeated at 1-, 2-, or 5-s intervals depending on the rate of modification.For patch clamp experiments, the oocyte vitelline membranes were removed manually, and the oocytes were transferred to a recording chamber containing standard bath solution. The pipette and bath solution contained 138 mm N-methyl d-glucamine, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 136 mm HCl, pH 7.4, with HCl. 20–30 GΩ seals were obtained by gentle suction. Single CFTR channel currents were recorded in cell-attached configuration, at a pipette potential of ±100 mV via an Axopatch 200B amplifier, filtered at 100 Hz, digitized online at 500 Hz using an ITC-18 board, and recorded on disk by Pulse software. CFTR channels were activated by forskolin (10 μm) and IBMX (1 mm). The experiments were performed at room temperature. Current records of at least 5-min duration were idealized using half-amplitude threshold crossing for each experimental condition by TAC software (Bruxton, Seattle, WA) for Po evaluation. The total number of channels in a patch was assumed to be the maximum number of open channel current levels observed over the full duration of the experiment (5–15 min). The data were fitted and modeled using Igor Pro (Wave Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR).For kinetic analysis, the current records were filtered digitally at 50Hz and idealized using half-amplified threshold crossing, with imposition of fixed dead time of 6.5 ms. Events lists were fitted with a simple model in which all principal gating transitions were pooled into a closed-open scheme, and flickery closures were modeled as pore blockage events resulting in the three state closed-open-blocked scheme (C-O-B). Rate constants rCO, rOC, rOB, and rBO were extracted by a simultaneous fit to the dwell time histograms of all conductance levels, as described (15Csanady L. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mean interburst and burst durations were then calculated as τib = 1/rCO and τb = (1/rOC)(1 + rOB/rBO), respectively. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's unpaired (2-tailed) t test was used to determine the significance (p < 0.05).Cysteine Modification–Stock solutions of 100 mm MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Canada) were made, and aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. For every experiment, single aliquots were thawed and diluted in LCa96, or in LCa96 containing forkolin and IBMX to the indicated concentration and used immediately. The effects of externally applied MTSEA, MTSET, MTSES, and Cd2+ on whole oocyte conductance, and the percentage of change in conductance was calculated for each oocytes. MTS reagents were applied for 3–8 min until modification reached a steady state. The whole cell conductance was plotted as a function of cumulative time and fitted by a single exponential function. The MTS concentration was raised to 1 mm to measure slowest rates and lowered to 100 μm and to 10 μm to measure the fastest rates. The lowest MTS concentration sufficient to produce a measurable change in conductance (within 3 min) was used to calculate the apparent second order reaction rate constant (k = 1/([MTS]τ)1).Statistical Methods–One-way analysis of variance with posthoc Donnet's test (PrismGraphPad) was used to assess the statistical significance of any change in cAMP-activated conductance following exposure to Cd2+ and MTS reagents (see Fig. 1C). A p value <0.01 was the threshold for statistically significant effect. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. unless specified otherwise. Student's unpaired (two-tailed) t test was used to assess the statistical significance for all other experiments.RESULTSIdentification of Substituted Cysteines Accessible to Cd2+ and MTSEA–In this study, each of 29 consecutive residues between amino acids 325 and 353 comprising extracellular loop 3 and TM6 (Fig. 1A) was substituted one at a time with cysteine (except for native Cys343), and the mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Twenty-six of the 28 mutants produced CFTR Cl- currents following activation with a mixture of forskolin (10 μm) and IBMX (1 mm). We examined the effects of two thiol-reactive agents on channel function: Cd2+, a cation capable of binding to SH groups, and MTSEA, a partially ionized primary amine. We assumed that Cd2+ only binds to those cysteines with side chains in a water-accessible surface, whereas MTSEA might also modify residues partially buried in the membrane (16Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Applications of dithiothreitol, Cd2+, or MTSEA (all reagents at 1 mm) were without significant effect on the whole cell Cl- conductance of oocytes expressing wild type CFTR (Fig. 1B). The positively charged residue Arg334 influences Cl- permeation properties and is therefore expected to be near the aqueous pore (9Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Application of Cd2+ to activated R334C CFTR reduced whole cell Cl- conductance by >80%, with the inhibition completely reversible upon Cd2+ removal (Fig. 1C). A brief application of dithiothreitol accelerated reversal associated with the removal of Cd2+. Subsequent application of MTSEA sharply and irreversibly increased the Cl- conductance, confirming previous studies (10Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Subsequent application of Cd2+ was without further effect, suggesting that both MTSEA and Cd2+ reacted with the same cysteine, viz. Cys334, and its complete modification by MTSEA abolished the binding of Cd2+. Representative experiments of other Cys-substituted CFTR mutants can be found in supplemental Fig. S1.Fig. 1D summarizes the effects of external Cd2+ and MTSEA on the whole cell conductances of various cysteine-substituted CFTR mutants. Both Cd2+ and MTSEA had significant effects on the conductances of only five (I331C, L333C, R334C, K335C, and T338C) of the 26 Cys-substituted channels examined. Cd2+ had a small but significant potentiating effect on K329C channels, but MTSEA, which by itself is without any significant effect, was able to abolish the potentiating effect of Cd2+ (supplemental Fig. S2). Surprisingly, MTSEA did not have a functional effect on any residues that were not identified by Cd2+ reactivity, even though it can permeate the membrane to reach residues on the other side of the ion permeation gate, as evidenced by its modification of K95C, a residue that is on the cytoplasmic side of the channel (17Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Linsdell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8945-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed on activated channels that undergo rapid transitions between the closed and open states. Thus, the observed reactivities represent composite of reactivities with closed and open channel conformations. The thiol side chains of these residues are presumably exposed to the aqueous phase during part or all of the gating cycle, and their modification by Cd2+ and MTSEA affected either the single-channel conductance or channel gating.Accessibility of Substituted Cysteines to MTSEA in the Inactive Closed State–To determine whether there was a state dependence to the observed reactivities, we examined the reactivity of these five residues (residues 331, 333, 334, 335, and 338) to MTSEA applied to the external side of the channel in the closed state. Before activation of CFTR by the cAMP mixture, the conductance of CFTR-expressing oocytes was very low and comparable with control water-injected oocytes. The oocytes were exposed to MTSEA (1 mm) for 3 min before cAMP stimulation, when the channels were in the inactive closed state. The MTSEA was then washed away, and the channels were subsequently activated by perfusion of the cAMP mixture. The effect of Cd2+ on whole cell Cl- conductance was then assayed. We reasoned that if a cysteine side chain was not accessible to MTSEA in the channel closed state, the activated channel would retains its sensitivity to Cd2+, whereas if the cysteine was modified by MTSEA in the closed state, then subsequent application of Cd2+ to activated channels would be without effect on whole cell conductance. An example of this protocol applied to R334C-CFTR expressing oocytes is shown in Fig. 2A. The normal inhibitory effect of Cd2+ was nearly absent for channels that had been pre-exposed to MTSEA in the closed state. The magnitude of the loss of Cd2+ sensitivity was similar to that observed for activated R334C-CFTR that had been modified by MTSEA (e.g. Fig. 1C). The results for all five Cys-substituted channels are summarized in Fig. 2B. Strikingly, for all the five Cys-substituted channels that were pre-exposed to MTSEA in the closed state, the normal inhibitory effect of Cd2+ was either absent or substantially reduced. These results suggest that the thiol side chains of cysteines in these five positions are accessible to MTSEA in the inactive closed state.FIGURE 2Effects of extracellular MTSEA applied to CFTR channels in the closed state. A, representative experiment in which MTSEA (1 mm) was applied for 3 min to R334C-CFTR channels that are closed. Upon stimulation by IMBX/forskolin, Cd2+ was applied, and its effect on whole cell conductance was measured. B, summary of effects of Cd2+ on MTSEA-modified I331C, L333C, R334C, K335C, and T338C channels. The percentage of change in whole cell conductance affected by Cd2+ is plotted for each Cys-substituted CFTR. MTSEA was applied either after activation by IBMX (solid bars; aM) or before IBMX activation (hatched bars; bM), when the channels were closed. For comparison, the effect on Cd2+ on unmodified channels (uM) is included.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Effects of Cd2+ and MTSEA on Substituted Cysteines in E1371Q-CFTR–To study the accessibility of substituted cysteines in the open state, the effects of Cd2+ and MTSEA were examined for CFTR channels bearing the E1371Q mutation. This Glu to Gln mutation in NBD2 prevents ATP hydrolysis without affecting ATP binding and stabilizes the open state of the channel by almost 1000-fold compared with WT-CFTR (19Vergani P. Lockless S.W. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 2005; 433: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 20Stratford F.L. Ramjeesingh M. Cheung J.C. Huan L.J. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the average burst duration of this mutant is 7–8 min (19Vergani P. Lockless S.W. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 2005; 433: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), most of the channels bearing this mutation are likely to be locked in the open state for the entire duration of the experiment (3–5 min). Hence, the observed effects of Cd2+ and MTS reagents, on E1371Q CFTR represent effects on open channel state. As shown in Fig. 3A, the open probability (Po) of wild type CFTR channels was about 0.2, whereas it was nearly 1 for E1371Q-CFTR. The open probability of various mutant channels in 1371E (WT), and in Gln1371 background can be found in supplemental Fig. S3. Depending on the position of the introduced cysteine, dramatic differences in the magnitude of the functional effects between Glu1371 (WT) and Gln1371 channels were observed. For example, whereas L333C in the Glu1371 (WT) channel was inhibited by either Cd2+ or MTSEA, neither reagent was particularly effective when this mutation was present in the Gln1371 background (Fig. 3B). MTSEA had a small potentiating effect on K335C in the wild type channel background, whereas it was inhibitory in the “locked open” 1371Q channels (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the pore-lining residues R334C and T338C exhibited very small or no differences in their functional effects in the Glu1371 and Gln1371 channels, respectively. The differences between Glu1371 and Gln1371 backgrounds in the effects of Cd2+ and MTSEA on I331C, L333C, R334C, K335C, and T338C channels are summarized in Fig. 3 (C and E), respectively. The differences in the magnitude of MTS modification suggest that in E1371Q background there is a significant change in TM6 structure. This structural change, which manifests as a change in the efficacy of MTS modification, affects some residues but has no effect on nearby pore-lining residues.FIGURE 3Effects of extracellular Cd2+ and MTSEA applied to CFTR channels in the open state.

This analysis was carried out in both Glu1371 (WT) and Gln1371 backgrounds (Fig. 4A; summarized in Fig. 4 (B and C); MTSET data can be found in supplemental Fig. S4). The cysteine residues R334C and T338C, postulated to be pore-lining residues, showed no changes in their rates of modification by either MTSEA or MTSES. In contrast, I331C, L333C, and K335C reacted faster in the Glu1371 background (Fig. 4, B and C). These results reveal clearly that modification of I331C, L333C, and K335C by both these reagents was much slower in the Gln1371 mutational background than in the WT Glu1371 channels. The modification rates of both positively and negatively charged reagents were reduced, indicating that the slower reactivities were due to steric effects rather than electrostatic ones. The difference in reaction rates between WT and Gln1371 channels was greatest for K335C, which reacted nearly 800 times more slowly in E1371Q background. L333C showed a relatively smaller 10-fold decrease, and I331C reacted 5-fold slower (Fig. 4, B and C) in E1371Q channels. Because activated WT channels (Glu1371 background) are in the open state for a significant fraction of time (Po ≈ 0.2), the measured reaction rates in the WT channel background represent weighted sums of the open and closed state reaction rates. Because the reactivity is much slower in the channel open state (Gln1371), the measured rates in wild type channels (Glu1371) therefore underestimate the true closed state reaction rates. Thus, the differences in reactivities between the closed and open states are likely to be larger than measured differences between Glu1371 and Gln1371 channels. Alternatively, it is possible that the observed reaction rates in E1371Q mutational background are due to a change in the channel structure induced by the mutation and not related to structural changes associated with open channel state.FIGURE 4MTSEA, and MTSES modification rates of residues in TM6 in WT and E1371Q backgrounds.

The length of the black bar connecting the symbol shows fold change in the rates between the open and closed conformation states.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Modification Rates Depend on CFTR Channel Po–In Xenopus oocytes, the cAMP-mediated activation of CFTR occurs by means of an increase in the open probability of CFTR channels (21Liu X. Smith S.S. Sun F. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To confirm that the modification rates depend on the channel Po, we examined the effects of MTSEA and MTSES on oocytes under two different activating conditions. In the presence of 0.02 mm IBMX, the whole cell conductance of oocytes is only 20–30% of the conductance elicited by 1 mm IBMX (Fig. 5, A and B). This decreased conductance is due to a proportional decrease in the channel Po as a smaller fraction of the total channels is active at any given time. Comparisons of the effects of MTSEA and MTSES on Cys-substituted channels under minimal (0.02 mm IBMX) and maximal (1 mm IBMX) activation conditions are summarized in Fig. 5C. All of the residues except L333C had varying but significant differences in the magnitude of the functional effect by MTS reagents. For example, under minimally active conditions, the stimulatory effect of MTSEA on R334C and K335C conductance was greater than under maximally active conditions. MTSES, however, had a smaller inhibitory effect on R334C and K335C when minimally activated. For I331C, the inhibitory effect of both MTSEA and MTSES was larger under minimally active conditions. The observed differences in the magnitude of the functional effects suggest that conformation of these residues changes with the open probability of the channel.FIGURE 5Effects of MTSEA, and MTSES depend on CFTR activation levels.

Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae are now often resistant to multiple drugs. In France, where the problem is particularly significant, ∼50% of the isolates have decreased susceptibility to β-lactams, most often combined with resistance to other classes of antibiotics such as erythromycin, tetracyclines, or sulfonamides (1Maugein J.

The formation of long-lived covalent adducts by β-lactam antibiotics within the PBP active site results in growth arrest or cell death (2Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Studies of the mechanisms of pneumococcal resistance to β-lactams have been performed for the past two decades through the employment of techniques ranging from epidemiological to structural analyses, and have converged on a common fact: S. pneumoniae resists β-lactams by introducing amino acid substitutions into key PBPs, which have then a decreased affinity for these antibiotics (3Hakenbeck R. Grebe T. Zahner D. Stock J.B. Mol Microbiol. 1999; 33: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The altered enzymes retain nonetheless their physiological activities. Of the six pneumococcal PBPs, three are modified in most resistant strains: PBP2b, PBP2x, and PBP1a (4Dowson C.G. Hutchison A. Brannigan J.A. George R.C. Hansman D. Linares J. Tomasz A. Smith J.M.

These low-affinity PBPs are encoded by mosaic genes that combine sequence fragments from various origins, including closely related species such as Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis (7Dowson C.G.

Although the geographic extent of resistance has been attributed to the spread of a small number of initial clones (9McGee L. McDougal L. Zhou J. Spratt B.G. Tenover F.C. George R. Hakenbeck R.

Examination of the sequences and crystal structures of PBP2x variants have revealed the existence of at least two distinct mechanisms for reducing the affinity of this enzyme for β-lactams (10Pernot L.

The transpeptidase (TP) domains of low-affinity PBPs typically contain between 20 and 40 amino acid substitutions (when compared with PBPs from the β-lactam-susceptible R6 strain). Many of the substitutions are likely irrelevant to the resistance mechanism, as they have been imported through homologous recombination with mutations that truly decrease the affinity for β-lactams. We have shown recently that out of 41 substitutions in PBP2x from the highly resistant strain 5204, only 6 contribute significantly to lowering the affinity for β-lactams (11Carapito R. Chesnel L. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1771-1777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). penicillin-binding protein transpeptidase glycosyltransferase cefotaxime penicillin G 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid root-mean-square glutathione S-transferase polyethyleneglycol. penicillin-binding protein transpeptidase glycosyltransferase cefotaxime penicillin G 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid root-mean-square glutathione S-transferase polyethyleneglycol. PBP2b and PBP2x are often referred to as primary determinants of β-lactam resistance, because cultivation of pneumococci in the presence of low amounts of piperacillin or cefotaxime selects for mutations in PBP2b or PBP2x, respectively (12Grebe T. Hakenbeck R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 829-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the levels of resistance conferred by low-affinity PBP2b and/or PBP2x variants are limited by the inhibition of the other unmodified PBPs. High levels of resistance are achieved only upon further alteration of PBP1a (13Barcus V.A. Ghanekar K. Yeo M. Coffey T.J. Dowson C.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 126: 299-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Reichmann P. Konig A. Marton A. Hakenbeck R. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Smith A.M.

Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Low-affinity PBP1a is therefore the most troublesome PBP from a clinical point of view. PBP1a is a bifunctional, class A enzyme, in that it consists of a short cytoplasmic region, an N-terminal membrane anchor segment, followed by a glycosyltransferase domain (GT), a linker region and a TP domain (17Macheboeuf P. Contreras-Martel C. Job V. Dideberg O. Dessen A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 673-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a soluble, proteolyzed form of PBP1a from strain R6 reveals that the TP domain, whose fold is typical of the serine penicilloyl transferase family of enzymes, is flanked by a short C-terminal region and an N-terminal β-strand-rich region, which carries a small peptide of the glycosyltransferase domain and serves as a linker between the two catalytic units (18Contreras-Martel C. Job V. Di Guilmi A.M. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Dessen A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Among 47 publicly available different sequences representing the TP domains from PBP1a variants (residues 264–654), 7 are very similar to the sequence of PBP1a from strain R6 with 1 to 4 amino acid substitutions. In contrast, 39 sequences are clearly mosaic and are presumably all from strains with reduced susceptibility to β-lactams. They carry between 13 and 60 substitutions over the entire TP domain. Individual reversion of the substitutions in PBP1a from strain 3191 (19Smith A.M. Klugman K.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which harbors 52 mutations in the TP domain, reduced the level of resistance in only two cases: a L539W substitution that is present in only two sequences, and the TSQF to NTGY substitutions at positions 574–577, which are present in nearly all mosaic sequences (38 out of 39). Here we present the crystal structure of a soluble form of PBP1a from the highly resistant pneumococcal strain 5204 (MICpenG = 6.0 mg·liter-1; MICCTX = 12.0 mg·liter-1) (20Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croize J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44448-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This PBP1a carries 48 substitutions when compared with the R6 strain, including 45 within the TP domain. The reaction between penicillin G and cefotaxime, and four different PBP1a clinical variants, as well as point mutants in positions 574–577, were also studied. The impact of these PBP1a variants on resistance was measured. The results are interpreted within the framework of the crystal structures of PBP1a from strains R6 and 5204. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis–Pneumococcal strains 4790, 5204, 5245, 5259 (University Hospital, Grenoble, France), and R6 were used as sources of genomic DNA for the amplification of pbp1a genes. The fragments encoding the extracellular region of PBP1a (residues 37–719, henceforth noted PBP1a) were PCR-amplified and introduced as BamHI/XhoI fragments in place of the pbp2x fragment in pGEX-S-pbp2x*-f1 (21Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This vector had been previously modified by site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate a second undesired BamHI site (GGATCC into GGGTCC) in the f1 region. Site-directed mutagenesis of pbp1a genes from strains R6 and 5204, to introduce or revert mutations T371A and TSQF(574–577)NTGY, were performed using Kunkel's automated method (22Kunkel T. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 23Carapito R. Gallet B. Zapun A. Vernet T. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 355: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) following production of single-stranded plasmids. In addition, replacement of residues 490–570 of 4790-PBP1a by the corresponding residues from 5245-PBP1a, was performed by employing a two-step PCR strategy. Three fragments were amplified: the region of 4790-PBP1a N-terminal to the target region, the zone C-terminal to the target region, and the 490–570 region of 5245-PBP1a. The three fragments were combined in a second PCR experiment, and introduced as a BamHI/XhoI fragment into modified pGEX-4T1-f1 (in which a BamHI site had been removed). All clones were verified by double-stranded sequencing (Cogenics Genome Express, Grenoble). Protein Expression and Purification–PBP1a variants were produced by employing the same methodology used for PBP1a from strain R6 (18Contreras-Martel C. Job V. Di Guilmi A.M. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Dessen A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 684-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), albeit in this work protein expression was performed in Escherichia coli MC1061 cells grown in autoinduction medium (24Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar) complemented with 100 mg·liter-1 of ampicillin, initially for 3 h at 37 °C and subsequently for 21 h at 20 °C. After similar lysis, centrifugation, and glutathione affinity steps, PBP1a variants were purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.2 m KCl. Yields were between 4 and 12 mg per liter of culture, depending on the variant. Purity was greater than 95% as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Crystallization and Data Collection–5204-PBP1a* was prepared for crystallization trials by initial digestion the GST-PBP1a fusion protein with a 1:1000 trypsin:protein ratio for 1 h. The asterisk denotes the proteolyzed form used for crystallization, corresponding mostly to the TP domain. The resulting protein, which consists of two associated peptides (residues 47–70 and 264–653), was subsequently purified from the GST tag with a second glutathione chromatography step, which was followed by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ HR 5/5) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. After elution of the protein with a linear gradient to 0.5 m NaCl, 5204-PBP1a* was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.0 and 0.1 m NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 4 mg/ml prior to crystallization. The homogeneity and identity of the sample were verified by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry using a Q-TOF Micro spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with an electro-spray ion source operated with a needle voltage of 3 kV, and sample cone and extraction voltages of 55 and 2 V, respectively. Spectra were recorded in the 500–2100 range of mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The sample was infused at 1 μm by diluting the sample in H2O/CH3CN (1/1 v/v), 0.2% formic acid. The data are treated by the Masslynx software (Waters). Measured masses were 2635.3 ± 0.2 Da and 43401 ± 5 Da, corresponding to the tryptic fragments 47–70 (predicted m = 2635 Da) and 264–653 (predicted m = 43395 Da). Crystals appeared in a variety of conditions in pH values ranging from 5.5 to 8.5 with different precipitants (PEG, (NH4)2SO4, NaCl). The best crystals were prepared in 0.1 m MES pH 6.0, 21% PEG 6000, 17 mm BaCl2 at 15 °C. Crystals were cryo-cooled after sequential transfer into crystallization solutions containing increasing amounts of ethylene glycol, until a maximum value of 20%. A dataset was collected to 1.9 Å at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF-Grenoble) ID14-EH3 beamline at 0.931 Å. Data processing was carried out with XDS (25Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRE (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) by employing the structure of PBP1a* from strain R6 as a model (PDB code 2C6W) in which active site residues were removed in order to avoid bias, and all residues differing between the two proteins were replaced by alanines.

J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The calculations were carried out in the absence of water molecules, and a sphere of radius of 1.5 Å was used. Acylation Efficiencies–The k2/K parameter was measured by following the decrease of the intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins (32Di Guilmi A.M. Mouz N. Andrieu J.P. Hoskins J. Jaskunas S.R. Gagnon J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5652-5659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at various concentrations of a large excess of antibiotic, using a SFM-400 stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic). Measurements were performed at 37 °C in a 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 buffer with 0.6 μm protein and 50–1000 μm of penicillin G or cefotaxime. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission was measured above 305 nm using a cut-off filter. The apparent pseudo-first order rate constant kapp was determined by non-linear fitting of the fluorescence data to equation Fluot = Fluo0·exp(-kapp·t) + a·t + c using the Bio-Kine software (Bio-Logic), where the a·t + c accounts for the slightly drifting fluorescence signal at the end of the reaction. The efficiency of acylation k2/K was determined by least squares linear fitting to the equation kapp = (k2/K)·[antibiotic] with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The mosaic variants of PBP1a showed no change of intrinsic fluorescence upon binding of penicillin G. Thus, the pseudo first-order rate constant for the acylation of the mosaic protein by penicillin G was measured by direct competition with cefotaxime (33Graves-Woodward K. Pratt R.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In these cases, kapp(penG) = kapp(mixture) - kapp(CTX), where kapp(penG) is the apparent rate of the reaction with penicillin G at the concentration of this antibiotic in the mixture, kapp(mixture) is the rate constant measured with a mixture of penicillin G and cefotaxime and kapp(CTX) is the rate constant measured in the absence of penicillin G but with the same concentration of cefotaxime as that present in the mixture. Transformations and Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations–The non-encapsulated S. pneumoniae R6 strain was used as a recipient for genetic transformation with 5204-pbp2x and various pbp1a variants. To prevent correction of the introduced mutations by the Hex mismatch repair system of the bacteria, an altered R6 strain (hexA::spc) (34Claverys J.P. Lacks S.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 133-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used when point mutations were introduced. Transformation and measurements of minimal inhibitory concentrations by E-tests were performed as described previously (20Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croize J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44448-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sequence Comparisons–As with other low-affinity PBPs of clinical origin, the mosaicity of PBP1a defies attempts at phylogenetic-like classification. However, it appears that, with a single exception, the mosaic PBP1a sequences all share a common block of substitutions spanning residues 540–612, which includes between 10 and 18 substitutions. This sequence block is characterized by the four consecutive substitutions at positions 574–577 that were found to be important for resistance (19Smith A.M. Klugman K.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This ubiquitous sequence block is combined in various ways with a variety of other blocks. The only mosaic sequence that does not contain the above-mentioned sequence block is entirely devoid of substitution in its C-terminal part following position 533. In the course of sequencing the PBPs of 23 pneumococcal clinical isolates from the University Hospital in Grenoble, we encountered four distinct groups of mosaic PBP1a sequences, represented by strains 5204, 4790, 5245, and 5259. An alignment of the sequences corresponding to the TP domains of these PBPs is shown in Fig. 1. Sequences from strains 5204, 4790, and 5245 are very similar, and carry 45, 46, and 52 substitutions in the TP domain, respectively, with respect to PBP1a from drug-sensitive strain R6. They are from resistant strains with MICpenG values ≥ 1.5 μg·ml-1, and carry the TSQF(574–577)NTGY substitutions within the 540–612 sequence block, as well as the T371A substitution within the first catalytic motif, next to the active site Ser370. Seven substitutions near the C terminus of the TP domain are absent in 5204-PBP1a and present in PBP1a from strains 4790 and 5245. 4790-PBP1a differs from the two other close sequences by the absence of 9 substitutions, an additional one and a different one in the 495–570 segment. PBP1a from strain 5259 is unusual in that it lacks the T371A substitution, and has no substitution following residue 533, thus lacking the abovementioned mutations in residues 574–577. The TP domain of 5259-PBP1a nevertheless carries 33 mutations, including 24 that are in common with 5204- and 5245-PBP1a. The originating strain 5259 has only a mildly reduced susceptibility to penicillin G (MICpenG = 0.19 μg·ml-1). These four clinical variants of PBP1a, and that from the reference susceptible strain R6, gave us the opportunity to test the impact of their differences on β-lactam resistance. Functional Characterization of PBP1a from Clinical Variants–The recombinant extracellular domains of PBP1a variants from strains R6, 5259, 4790, 5204, and 5245 were produced as GST fusion proteins, and the kinetics of the reaction of each fusion protein with penicillin G and cefotaxime were measured by following the decrease of intrinsic fluorescence that follows binding of the antibiotic. The reaction between PBPs and β-lactams is classically described by Reaction 1, E+IK-1⇄EIk2→EI*k3→E+PREACTION 1 where E is the enzyme, I is the β-lactam, and EI is a non-covalent complex with the dissociation constant K. The covalent acyl-enzyme EI* is formed with the rate constant k2, and finally the enzyme is deacylated with the rate constant k3, to regenerate an active enzyme and release an inactivated compound P. The measured acylation efficiencies, characterized by the second order rate constant k2/K are presented in Table 2.TABLE 2Acylation efficiencies of, and resistance conferred by, PBP1a variants of clinical origins Reactions were performed at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, and 0.2 m KCl. Rate constants are given with the standard error calculated from two independent experiments with five measurements of kapp each. The susceptible strain R6 (MICCTX < 0.016 μg·ml–1) was cotransformed with 5204-pbp2x.PBP1ak2/KMIC CefotaximePenicillin GCefotaximem–1·s–1μg·ml–1R669000 ± 1500011000 ± 7000.2552598600 ± 6004000 ± 5500.384790820 ± 160700 ± 100.755204430 ± 110480 ± 715245420 ± 90440 ± 401 Open table in a new tab The values of k2/K obtained with R6-PBP1a are consistent with previously published results (32Di Guilmi A.M. Mouz N. Andrieu J.P. Hoskins J. Jaskunas S.R. Gagnon J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5652-5659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mosaic PBP1a proteins have decreased acylation efficiencies by factors of 3 to 25 for cefotaxime, and 8 to 164 for penicillin G. Thus, the alterations in our variants of PBP1a have a greater effect decreasing the reactivity toward penicillin than toward cefotaxime, a cephalosporin. The acylation efficiencies of 5204- and 5245-PBP1a do not differ significantly, indicating that the seven additional substitutions of 5245-PBP1a at the C-terminus of the TP domain are not involved in the low-affinity for β-lactams. The k2/K of 5245-PBP1a for cefotaxime and penicillin G are 1.6- and 2-fold smaller than those of 4790-PBP1a, implying that the differences at 10 positions in the 490–570 region also have a rather limited effect on the reactivity toward β-lactams. The combined effect of the 34 substitutions within the 5259-PBP1a transpeptidase domain, which do not include neither the highly prevalent TSQF(574–577)NTGY substitutions nor the active site T371A mutation, is modest but significant, indicating that mutations other than the aforementioned substitutions can also participate in the decreased affinity of PBP1a for β-lactams. To associate the kinetic observations and the in vivo resistance phenomenon, the four pbp1a genes of clinical origin were introduced into the susceptible recipient strain R6. In order to reveal the effect of mosaic pbp1a genes, and because of the fact that a low affinity PBP1a is incapable of conferring resistance on its own, a fact which is linked to the essential nature and high affinity of R6-PBP2x for cefotaxime, it was necessary to co-transform pbp1a variants together with 5204-pbp2x, which encodes a PBP2x with a very low affinity for cephalosporins (20Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croize J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44448-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The other pneumococcal PBPs are either non-essential, or, as in the case of PBP2b, have a naturally low affinity for cephalosporins. Therefore, resistance to cefotaxime can be conferred by altering only pbp2x and pbp1a. The MIC value for cefotaxime was measured and results are given in Table 2. The PBP1a proteins with the lowest k2/K confer the highest resistance levels. Interestingly, even the modestly decreased efficiency of acylation of 5259-PBP1a increases the resistance level. Role of the T371A and TSQF(574–577)NTGY Mutations–The TSQF(574–577)NTGY block of mutations has been shown to be an important determinant of the level of resistance conferred by PBP1a from strain 3191 (19Smith A.M. Klugman K.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another potentially important substitution is T371A, which lies adjacent to Ser370, the active site nucleophile; notably, the same substitution is observed in many mosaic PBP2x variants and has been shown to influence the acylation efficiency of this latter protein (35Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of these mutations on the reactivity of PBP1a toward β-lactams, a set of six variants were constructed, where the T371A and TSQF(574–577)NTGY mutations were introduced individually or together into R6-PBP1a. The reverse substitutions were also introduced into 5204-PBP1a. The recombinant extracellular domains fused to GST were produced, and their efficiencies of acylation by cefotaxime and penicillin G were measured (Table 3).TABLE 3Acylation efficiencies of, and resistance conferred by, PBP1a point-mutants Reactions were at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, and 0.2 m KCl.

We show for the first time that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) binds glucose and glucose metabolites with high affinity, resulting in significantly altered PPARα secondary structure. Glucose decreased PPARα interaction with fatty acid metabolites and steroid receptor coactivator-1 while increasing PPARα interaction with DNA. Concomitantly, glucose increased PPARα interaction with steroid receptor coactivator-1, DNA binding, and transactivation of β-oxidation pathways in the presence of activating ligands. Heterodimerization of PPARα to the retinoid X receptor-α resulted in even larger increases in transactivation with the addition of glucose. These data suggest that PPARα is responsible for maintaining energy homeostasis through a concentration-dependent regulation of both lipids and sugars and that hyperglycemic injury mediated by PPARα occurs not only indirectly through elevated long chain fatty acid levels but also through direct action of glucose on PPARα.

Energy homeostasis is a highly complex and strictly regulated process. Free fatty acids compete with glucose for oxidation, and increased free fatty acid concentrations are associated with reduced muscle glycogen synthesis. Dysregulation at any step may elicit severe pathophysiological complications, as seen in diabetes. Maintained low levels of blood glucose are critical for preventing or delaying the clinical complications of diabetes, such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (1Zhang Y. Lee F.Y.

Although the liver plays essential roles in the control of blood glucose levels by modulating gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis, the specific mechanism(s) of this regulation is unclear. Several studies suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), 2The abbreviations used are: PPARαperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor αLCFAlong chain fatty acidSRC-1steroid receptor coactivator-1RXRαretinoid X receptor αG-1-Pglucose-1-phosphateG-6-Pglucose-6-phosphatePPREperoxisome proliferator response elementL-FABPliver fatty acid-binding proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineLSCMlaser scanning confocal microscopy. 2The abbreviations used are: PPARαperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor αLCFAlong chain fatty acidSRC-1steroid receptor coactivator-1RXRαretinoid X receptor αG-1-Pglucose-1-phosphateG-6-Pglucose-6-phosphatePPREperoxisome proliferator response elementL-FABPliver fatty acid-binding proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineLSCMlaser scanning confocal microscopy. a ligand-regulated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, contributes to this regulation. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α long chain fatty acid steroid receptor coactivator-1 retinoid X receptor α glucose-1-phosphate glucose-6-phosphate peroxisome proliferator response element liver fatty acid-binding protein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline laser scanning confocal microscopy. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α long chain fatty acid steroid receptor coactivator-1 retinoid X receptor α glucose-1-phosphate glucose-6-phosphate peroxisome proliferator response element liver fatty acid-binding protein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline laser scanning confocal microscopy. PPARα is highly expressed in liver and is the target of potent hypolipidemic drugs, such as fibrates, used to treat cardiovascular disease (2Kersten S. Mandard S. Escher P. Gonzalez F.J. Tafuri S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although a variety of compounds bind and activate PPARα, long chain fatty acids (LCFA) and their metabolites (i.e. long chain fatty acyl-CoAs, LCFA-CoA) function as high affinity, endogenous ligands (3Lin Q.

Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 299S-304SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding initiates PPARα transcription of multiple genes in fatty acid and glucose metabolism while concomitantly down-regulating genes in insulin signaling (7Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Bodzioch M. Kawecka-Jaszcz K. J. Phys. Pharm. 2005; 56: 149-162PubMed Google Scholar), and PPARα-null mice are protected from high fat diet-induced insulin resistance (11Guerre-Millo M. Rouault C.

Protein Expression and Purification—The bacterial expression vector containing murine PPARα (pET-PPARαΔAB) was expressed in the BL21(DE3)pLysS strain of Escherichia coli as described (3Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and purified by cation exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Dialyzation, quantification, and protein quality were analyzed as previously described (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This truncated version, rather than the full-length protein, was used for the pure protein studies because of solubility issues with the full-length protein and difficulties with its recombinant purification. Although this recombinant protein was lacking the A/B domain, the entire DNA-binding domain and ligand-binding domain were present. This truncated version is expected to show ligand binding properties identical to those of the full-length receptor based upon similar experiments with PPARγ (12Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). However, the A/B region of PPARα has been found to have a transactivating function through the ligand-independent transactivation domain (AF-1 activity) (14Hi R. Osada S. Yumoto N. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35152-35158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and for this reason, the full-length protein was used for the coimmunoprecipitation, DNA binding, and transactivation assays. Glucose Binding Assay—The direct binding of glucose and the glucose metabolites (glucose-1-phosphate, G-1-P; glucose-6-phosphate, G-6-P) to 100 nm PPARαΔAB was determined by quenching of intrinsic PPARαΔAB aromatic amino acid fluorescence as previously described for nonfluorescent fatty acids and fatty acyl-CoAs (4Hostetler H.A.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7669-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Emission spectra from 300 to 400 nm were obtained at 24 °C by excitation at 280 nm with a PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). The data were corrected for background (buffer, fluorescent ligands, and solvent effects), and the maximal intensities were used to calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) and the number of binding sites as previously described (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Autoglycation—To determine whether PPARα autoglycation could occur under the conditions of the binding and circular dichroism assays, 100 nm PPARαΔAB was incubated with 1 μm 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose supplemented with cold glucose for a final concentration of 20 mm at room temperature for 30 min in PBS. Following incubation, the mixture was applied to a filtration device (Microcon; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and centrifuged to remove free glucose. The resulting protein-glucose mixture was washed three times with excess glucose to determine whether the radioactive glucose was permanently bound (covalent) or could be removed. Each flow-through and retentate was examined for activity with a scintillation counter as compared with no protein controls. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroic spectra of 0.8 μm PPARαΔAB were taken in the absence and presence of glucose and glucose metabolites with a J-710 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Inc., Easton, MD) as previously described (4Hostetler H.A.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7669-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Glucose concentrations below (0.6 μm) and above (6 μm) a 1:1 protein to glucose ratio were examined, whereas the physiological concentrations found in the unstressed rat liver (11 μm G-1-P, 0.2 mm G-6-P) were examined for metabolites (15Stewart J.M. Dewling V.F. Wright T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ten scans were averaged for the percentage of composition of secondary structures by three different methods (SELCON3, CDSSTR, and CONTIN/LL) with the software package CDPro (16Sreerama N. Woody R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar) as previously described (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Fatty Acid and Acyl-CoA Binding—PPARα binding affinity for a fluorescent 16 carbon fatty acid analog (BODIPY C-16, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and its CoA thioester (BODIPY C-16-CoA, produced and purified as previously described for acyl-CoAs (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)) was determined. Because of solubility issues with the BODIPY compounds, PPARαΔAB binding affinity was first determined by quenching of intrinsic PPARαΔAB aromatic amino acid fluorescence as described above for glucose. Because both glucose and the BODIPY compounds resulted in quenching of PPARαΔAB intrinsic fluorescence, BODIPY fluorescence was used for determining the effect of glucose on BODIPY fatty acid and fatty acyl-CoA binding. For binding assays, 100 nm PPARαΔAB protein was titrated with increasing concentrations of BODIPY C-16 or BODIPY C-16-CoA in the presence of 6 mm glucose. For displacement assays, binding of 100 nm PPARαΔAB protein with 50 nm BODIPY C-16 or BODIPY C-16-CoA was measured, and the effect of glucose on BODIPY displacement was measured as a decrease in fluorescence intensity. Emission spectra from 490 to 540 nm were obtained at 24 °C by excitation at 460 nm with a PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). The data were corrected for background (buffer, fluorescent ligands, and solvent effects), and the maximal intensities were used to calculate the percentage of change in BODIPY C-16 and BODIPY C-16-CoA binding as well as the dissociation constant (Kd), inhibition constant (KI), and number of binding sites as previously described (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—COS-7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Murine L-cell (L arpt- tk-) fibroblasts were grown as previously described (17Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29139-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—COS-7 cells were transfected with mammalian expression vectors for full-length PPARα (pSG5-PPARα) (18Patsouris D. Mandard S. Voshol P.J. Escher P. Tan N.S. Havekes L.M.

A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was replaced with serum-free, glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen) 20 h post-transfection and incubated for an additional 2 h. Cell lysis, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot procedures were conducted as previously described for liver homogenate with fatty acyl-CoAs (5Hostetler H.A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7669-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mg of cell lysate was mixed with activating ligand and/or glucose as indicated in the figure legend, and the cell lysates were incubated with antibody-linked resin for 1.5 h at room temperature. Eluted proteins were examined by Western blot analysis. The values were normalized to the amount of PPARα protein detected, and the samples in the presence of 10 μm clofibric acid and in the absence of glucose were arbitrarily set to 100%. NoShift DNA Binding Assays—Full-length PPARα and RXRα RNA was prepared from the mammalian expression plasmids pSG5-PPARα (18Patsouris D. Mandard S. Voshol P.J. Escher P. Tan N.S. Havekes L.M.

To obtain quantitative data, the NoShift™II PPAR transcription factor assay kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) was utilized per the manufacturer's instructions with in vitro synthesized full-length PPARα (2 μl) and RXRα (2 μl) lysates. Glucose was added to the incubation mixtures as indicated in the figure legend. Luminescence was measured with a Microlite ML3000 microtiter plate luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Chantilly, VA). The values are presented as the percentage of binding where clofibric acid-induced DNA binding (positive control) is arbitrarily set to 100%. Transactivation Assays—COS-7 cells grown in 6-well culture plates were transfected with 1 μg of each full-length mammalian expression vector (pSG5-PPARα (18Patsouris D. Mandard S. Voshol P.J.

Noon D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar), and 0.05 μg of the internal transfection control plasmid pRL-CMV (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection incubation, the medium was replaced with serum-free, glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 2 h, and then the ligands were added, and the cells were grown for an additional 24 h. Arachidonic acid was added to cells as a complex with bovine serum albumin as previously described (22Spector A.A. Hoak J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To ensure adequate nuclear levels of these ligands (clofibric acid, arachidonic acid, and glucose) for interaction with PPARα (21Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noon D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 23Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), higher concentrations were used for the cell-based transactivation experiments than for the pure protein experiments. Firefly luciferase activity, normalized to Renilla luciferase (for transfection efficiency), was determined with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured with a Microlite ML3000 microtiter plate luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.). Determination of Intracellular Glucose Concentration and Nuclear Distribution—COS-7 and L-cells were seeded onto 10-cm culture dishes (for determination of total intracellular glucose concentration) or Lab-Tek chambered cover glass (for determination of nuclear distribution) and cultured as described above for 24 h. The cells were washed two times with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in serum-free, glucose-free DMEM (Invitrogen) to ensure utilization of exogenous glucose. For total intracellular glucose determination and nuclei isolations, the media were replaced with fresh serum-free, glucose-free DMEM supplemented with either 6 μm or 6 mm glucose, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min or 2 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the culture media were removed and examined for glucose content as compared with controls. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and placed on ice. For total intracellular glucose concentration, the cells were lysed in M-PER® buffer (Pierce) containing 150 mm sodium chloride and protease inhibitors for 10 min at room temperature. Protein content of cell lysate was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and used to estimate total cell number. The nuclei were isolated with the Nuclei EZ Prep nuclei isolation Kit (Sigma) per the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclei were diluted and counted with a hemocytometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Glucose content for cell lysates, nuclei, and cytoplasmic components was determined by the Autokit Glucose CII (Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA) per the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of glucose distribution, the medium was replaced with PBS containing 1.25 μm Syto59 DNA-binding dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and background images were taken. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with PBS containing 6 μm 6-NBD-glucose, a fluorescent, nonhydrolyzable glucose analog (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Following incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and imaged in fresh PBS (see below). Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM)—LSCM studies were performed with a ×63 Plan-Fluor oil immersion objective, N.A.1.45, an Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss, Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY), and MRC-1024 fluorescence imaging system (Bio-Rad) as previously described (17Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29139-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The Syto59 and NBD-glucose probes were excited with laser 488/568 lines with a krypton-argon laser (Coherent, Sunnyvale, CA). Emission from NBD-glucose was recorded by a photomultiplier after passing through a 522/D35 emission filter and emission from Syto59 was collected with a 680/32 emission filter, both under manual gain and black level control. The objective was focused to acquire 0.3-μm confocal slice images through median sections of cells in the field. The cells were excited for 0.1-s intervals, regulated by a computer-controlled shutter and Laser Sharp software (Bio-Rad). The images were analyzed using Image J software from the National Institutes of Health (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The number of pixels of NBD-glucose colocalized with the Syto59 (nuclear localization) as well as the number of NBD-glucose pixels not colocalized with Syto59 (cytoplasmic) were averaged over several replicates (n = 5, ∼20 cells each) to obtain the percentage of distribution of NBD-glucose. Calculation of Intracellular and Nuclear Glucose Concentrations—The amount of NBD-glucose in the nucleus was calculated based upon the percentage of distribution (determined by LSCM fluorescence imaging) in nuclei versus cytoplasm (plus plasma membrane) from the medial cross-sectional plane. Estimated cellular protein concentration and cellular volumes were as described (25Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Atshaves B.P. Woldegiorgis G. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2484-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and final concentrations were calculated from the amount of glucose in the whole cell or nucleus divided by the estimated respective volumes of the whole cell and nucleus. To determine whether NBD-glucose distribution was similar to glucose distribution, the amount of glucose in purified nuclei was compared with the amount of glucose in the cytoplasmic fraction. Calculation of Nuclear PPARα Concentrations—Liver homogenates from male C57BL/6 mice were prepared and quantified as previously described for coimmunoprecipitation (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Liver homogenates and known amounts of purified PPARα protein (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously for PPARα coimmunoprecipitation (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Protein bands were quantified by densitometry, utilizing a single-chip charge-coupled device video camera FluorChemimager and accompanying FluorChem image analysis software from Alpha Innotech (San Leandro, CA). Total cell number, intracellular volume, and nuclear volume were 1.7 × 108 cells/g of liver, 6.2pL, and 1.8pL, respectively, as determined previously (26Drochmans P. Wanson J-C. Mosselmans R. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Buira I. Poch E. Sanchez O. Fernandez-Varo G. Grau M. Tebar F. Ramirez I. Soley M. J. Cell Physiol. 2004; 198: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Final concentrations were calculated from the amount of PPARα protein in the whole cell or nucleus divided by the estimated respective volumes of the whole cell and nucleus. Statistical Analysis—All of the results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance between samples in the presence or absence of glucose was determined by using the Student's t test with p < 0.05. PPARα Exhibits High Affinity for Glucose and Glucose Metabolites—To determine whether glucose itself directly affects PPARα, PPARα binding of glucose and glucose metabolites was examined. The addition of glucose decreased the intrinsic fluorescence of PPARα, corresponding to ligand binding (4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This change in fluorescence with increasing glucose yielded a sharp saturation curve with a maximal change noted at ∼100 nm (Fig. 1A), which transformed into a linear reciprocal plot (inset), indicating high affinity of PPARα for glucose at a single binding site. Multiple replicates (n = 4) yielded a Kd = 2.0 ± 0.4 nm, similar to those obtained previously for unsaturated LCFA and LCFA-CoA (3Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Hostetler H.A. Petrescu A.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18667-18682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Hostetler H.A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7669-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is a ligand binding effect, not a covalent modification, because bound radiolabeled glucose was displaced with an excess of nonradiolabeled glucose under the conditions utilized in these assays (data not shown). This suggests that PPARα is highly sensitive to glucose prior to any physical manifestation, such as autoglycation, seen much later in chronic instances such as diabetes. To determine specificity for glucose, PPARα affinity for glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P; Fig. 1B) and glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P; Fig. 1C) was examined. Both glucose metabolites decreased PPARα fluorescence, indicating strong saturable binding at a single site; G-1-P Kd = 25.3 ± 3.5 nm, G-6-P Kd = 63.2 ± 6.6 nm. These data demonstrate that both glucose and its metabolites directly interact with PPARα with high affinity. PPARα Binding to Glucose Results in Changes to PPARα Secondary Structure—To determine whether ligand binding altered PPARα conformation, CD was used to determine glucose effects on PPARα secondary structure. The CD spectra of PPARα exhibited a large peak in molar ellipticity at 192 nm and two concomitant negative peaks at 207 and 222 nm (Fig. 1D and E, filled circles). Because maximal glucose binding was noted near a 1:1 glucose to PPARα protein molar ratio, lower (3:4, 0.6 μm, open circles) and higher (15:2, 6 μm, open triangles) ratios than 1:1 were examined, both resulting in diminished minima and maxima (Fig. 1D). Although glucose metabolites (Fig. 1E; G-1-P, open circles; G-6-P, open triangles) significantly altered PPARα spectra in a similar manner as glucose, higher concentrations were required to elicit maximal CD changes, consistent with their weaker affinity. When multiple replicates (n = 3-4) of CD spectra were analyzed for the percentage of composition of α-helices, β-sheets, turns, and unordered structures, the addition of 0.6 and 6 μm glucose, 11 μm G-1-P, and 0.2 mm G-6-P resulted in similar changes (Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2069291704,"Recognition of cognate Rho GTPases by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) is fundamental to Rho GTPase signaling specificity. Two main GEF families use either the Dbl homology (DH) or the DOCK homology region 2 (DHR-2) catalytic domain. How DHR-2-containing GEFs distinguish between the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 is not known. To determine how these GEFs specifically recognize the two Rho GTPases, we studied the amino acid sequences in Rac2 and Cdc42 that are crucial for activation by DOCK2, a Rac-specific GEF, and DOCK9, a distantly related Cdc42-specific GEF. Two elements in the N-terminal regions of Rac2 and Cdc42 were found to be essential for specific interactions with DOCK2 and DOCK9. One element consists of divergent amino acid residues in the switch 1 regions of the GTPases. Significantly, these residues were also found to be important for GTPase recognition by Rac-specific DOCK180, DOCK3, and DOCK4 GEFs. These findings were unexpected because the same residues were shown previously to interact with GTPase effectors rather than GEFs. The other element comprises divergent residues in the β3 strand that are known to mediate specific recognition by DH domain containing GEFs. Remarkably, Rac2-to-Cdc42 substitutions of four of these residues were sufficient for Rac2 to be specifically activated by DOCK9. Thus, DOCK2 and DOCK9 specifically recognize Rac2 and Cdc42 through their switch 1 as well as β2–β3 regions and the mode of recognition via switch 1 appears to be conserved among diverse Rac-specific DHR-2 GEFs.

Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). They are active when bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and become inactive in the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state following GTP hydrolysis. Activation involves the exchange of GDP for GTP (15Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar).

GEFs control the function of small GTPases through at least two mechanisms. On one hand they catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange activity of Rho GTPases in response to appropriate activation signals. On the other hand they dictate the spatial and temporal contexts in which the activation of GTPases occurs, and thereby contribute to the specificity of Rho GTPase signaling pathways (16Erickson J.W.

Dbl-related GEFs share a catalytic domain of about 200 amino acids called the Dbl homology (DH) domain. Detailed information on how GEFs interact with Rho GTPases is available for Dbl-related but not CDM GEFs. Determination of the three-dimensional structures for a number of DH domains, alone or in complex with their cognate Rho GTPases, has provided insights into how Rho GTPases are specifically recognized by GEFs as well as the mechanism of the exchange reaction. These structural studies have also revealed that divergent amino acid residues in the β2–β3 regions of Rac and Cdc42 are the major determinants of specific interactions with DH-domain containing GEFs (26Aghazadeh B.

Members of one subfamily include DOCK2 and DOCK180, which activate Rac to mediate cellular processes such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis (6Fukui Y. Hashimoto O. Sanui T. Oono T. Koga H. Abe M.

Interestingly, the physiological activation of Rac by these GEFs requires their association with a regulatory protein ELMO1 (Engulfment and Motility) (6Fukui Y. Hashimoto O. Sanui T. Oono T. Koga H.

Blood. 2003; 102: 2948-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Another distantly related subfamily of CDM GEFs includes DOCK9, also called Zizimin1, which specifically activates Cdc42. DOCK9 has been shown to induce filopodia formation, however, the exact physiological roles of this subfamily have not been defined (35Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To date, no information regarding elements in Rac and Cdc42 that mediate specific interactions with CDM GEFs is available. Here, we identify the main determinants in Rac2 and Cdc42 that mediate their specific activation by DOCK2 and DOCK9. Interestingly, we found that divergent residues in the switch 1 regions of Rac2 and Cdc42, in addition to divergent amino acids in β2–β3 regions, play critical roles in the specific activation of these GTPases by DOCK2 and DOCK9. These observations suggest that CDM family GEFs and DH family GEFs use different elements to specifically recognize and activate cognate GTPases. Plasmids and MutagenesispCG plasmids expressing DOCK2, ELMO1, and Rac2 cDNAs were previously described (14Janardhan A. Swigut T. Hill B. Myers M.P. Skowronski J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E6Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DOCK9 (KIAA1058), DOCK3 (KIAA0299), and DOCK4 (KIAA0716) cDNA clones were obtained from Takahiro Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan. Cdc42 cDNA was kindly provided by Linda Van Aelst, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York. DOCK2 and ELMO1 truncation mutants and Rac2/Cdc42 chimeras were constructed using PCR. DOCK180-(1111–1616), DOCK2-(1115–1645), DOCK3-(1023–1519), and DOCK4-(551–1078) fragments comprising their DHR-2 domains were amplified by PCR. Point mutations were generated with the QuikChange XLII site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All cDNAs were subcloned into pCG vectors specifying N-terminal myc (EQKLISEEDL), His7-myc (HHHHHHHEQKLISEEDL), or a 30-amino acid long HA-Flag-AU-myc quadruple (tag) (YPYDVPDYADYKDDDDKDTYRYIEQKLISEEDL) epitope tag. Recombinant ProteinsRecombinant GST-myc-GTPases or His7-myc-DHR-2 domains (DOCK2-(1115–1645) and DOCK9-(1358–2068)) were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli strain as described previously (14Janardhan A.

Virol. 2003; 77: 8116-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For purification of GST-myc-GTPases, bacterial pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (LB: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice before sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g in an SS34 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were supplemented with Triton X-100 to 1% final concentration and 100 μl of packed glutathione-conjugated agarose beads were added per 750 ml of starting bacterial cultures. Samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 5 times with 10 bead volumes of LB and then eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Eluates were dialyzed to 50% glycerol in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and stored at –20 °C. Recombinant His7-myc-DHR-2 domains were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer, dialyzed to 50% glycerol in TBS, and stored at –20 °C. GST Pull-down Assay5-μg aliquots of GST-myc-GTPases were incubated with extracts prepared from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells expressing DOCK9, DOCK2, and ELMO1 in 500 μl of LB supplemented with 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. 5 μl of packed glutathione-conjugated agarose beads were added and samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with ice-cold LB, incubated for 10 min at 80 °C in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting for the myc epitope. p21-binding Domain (PBD) Pull-down AssayHEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with a total of 20 μg of plasmid DNA (1–2 μg of myc-GTPase alone or together with myc-DOCK2 and myc-ELMO1 (2 μg each) or myc-DOCK9 (10 μg) expression vectors and the appropriate amount of an empty pCG vector) using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (14Janardhan A. Swigut T. Hill B. Myers M.P. Skowronski J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E6Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). tag-Rac2, or tag-Cdc42, was used as an internal control. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of LB buffer supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100 and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge (5415C) for 10 min at 4 °C. 1 ml of cleared extract was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μg of GST-PBD of p21-activated kinase 1 bound to glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (14Janardhan A. Swigut T. Hill B. Myers M.P. Skowronski J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E6Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed as described above. Chemiluminescent signals were quantified using FluorChem Imaging System and software (Alpha Innotech, Cannock, United Kingdom). GTPγS Activation AssaysAliquots of detergent extracts containing 50 μg of proteins were supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and incubated with, or without, 0.1 mm GTPγS at 25 °C for 15 min. The nucleotide exchange reaction was terminated by adding MgCl2 to 10 mm, placing samples on ice, and subjecting them to PBD pull-down assays. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange AssayExchange assay was performed as previously described (37Watabe-Uchida M. John K.A. Janas J.A. Newey S.E. Van Aelst L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-myc-GTPases (∼2 μg) were incubated in 20 μl of loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm [3H]GDP (12.7 Ci/mmol)) for 25 min at 25 °C. The reaction was supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2, followed by 10 min incubation at 25 °C. Samples were then placed on ice, supplemented with ice-cold reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP) alone or together with a His7-myc-DHR-2 domain, to a final volume of 100 μl, and incubated at 25 °C. 20-μl aliquots were taken at time 0, and after 20 and 40 min of incubation, and added to 900 μl of ice-cold termination buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2). Samples were then filtered through nitrocellulose filters (BA85; Schleicher & Schuell), washed extensively with ice-cold termination buffer, and air-dried filters counted in Aquasol (PerkinElmer). Immunoblot AnalysisProteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and the membrane incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (5% Carnation powdered milk and 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-T)) containing anti-myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody. Membranes were washed in TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Pennsylvania, PA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed in TBS-T, treated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (GE Healthcare), and exposed to an x-ray film, or imaged using FluorChem Imaging System. Two Elements in the N-proximal Regions of Rac2 and Cdc42 Mediate Activation by DOCK2-ELMO1 and DOCK9To address how Rho GTPases are recognized by their cognate CDM family GEFs, we studied the interactions of Rac2 and Cdc42 with DOCK2 and DOCK9. DOCK2 activates Rac but not Cdc42, whereas DOCK9 activates Cdc42 but not Rac (6Fukui Y. Hashimoto O. Sanui T. Oono T. Koga H. Abe M. Inayoshi A. Noda M. Oike M. Shirai T. Sasazuki T.

We focused on DOCK2 and DOCK9 because they belong to the subfamilies of CDM proteins that are most divergent from each other. The amino acid sequences of the catalytic DHR-2 domains of DOCK2 and DOCK9 share 19% amino acid identity. To assess how Rac2 and Cdc42 selectively interact with DOCK2 and DOCK9, a series of chimeric Rac2/Cdc42 proteins were generated based on the locations of amino acid differences in their sequences (Fig. 1). The critical chimeras had Rac2 and Cdc42 amino acid sequences swapped at positions 39 between the switch 1 region and β2 strand, and/or at positions 58 between the β3 strand and switch 2 region (Fig. 1). Wild-type Rac2 and Cdc42 proteins and their chimeras were transiently expressed alone or together with DOCK9, or DOCK2 and ELMO1, in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) cells. As internal controls wild-type Rac2, or Cdc42, proteins tagged with a 30-amino acid long N-terminal peptide tag (tag-) were used. This modification permitted the control and test GTPases to be separated by SDS-PAGE. All proteins were tagged at their N termini with the myc epitope to facilitate their detection by immunoblotting. Detergent extracts were prepared from transfected cells and the GTP-bound forms of the GTPases were precipitated with the PBD of p21-activated kinase 1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (PBD-GST) and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Total GTPases present in detergent extracts and PBD-bound GTPases were resolved by SDS-PAGE, detected by immunoblotting for the myc epitope, and quantified by direct imaging of the chemiluminescent signals. The results of experiments to identify Cdc42 sequences that mediate specific activation by DOCK9 are shown in Fig. 2A. Expression of DOCK9 strongly stimulated the binding of Cdc42 to PBD (compare lanes 8). In contrast, no such effect was seen when DOCK9 was coexpressed with Rac2 (compare lanes 1). Thus the ability of DOCK9 to specifically activate Cdc42 was reproduced in a transient expression assay in HEK 293T cells. Interestingly, a chimeric GTPase comprising amino acids 1 to 58 of Cdc42 joined to amino acids 59 to 192 of Rac2 (C58R) was activated by DOCK9 almost as well as wild-type Cdc42 (Fig. 2A, histogram, compare lanes 7 with 8). In contrast, the reciprocal R58C chimera was severely defective for activation by DOCK9 (compare lanes 6 with 7 and 8). These observations indicated that divergent amino acids in the N-proximal 58 residues of Cdc42 are instrumental for its activation by DOCK9. Interestingly, chimeric proteins with Rac2 and Cdc42 sequences swapped at positions 39, such as C39R and R39C58R, were severely defective for activation by DOCK9 (compare lanes 3 and 4 with 7 and 8). As a control, chimeric GTPases were loaded with GTPγS in cell extracts and tested for their abilities to bind PBD in pull-down assays. These experiments revealed that all GTPases retained binding to PBD (see supplemental Fig. S1A). Together these observations suggested that at least one divergent amino acid residue located in the β1 strand and/or switch 1 region as well as at least one in the β2–β3 region of Cdc42 mediate specific activation of this GTPase by DOCK9. Similar experiments were performed to identify elements in Rac2 that mediate specific activation by DOCK2. The test and control GTPases were transiently co-expressed with DOCK2 and ELMO1 in HEK 293T cells. ELMO1 was included in these experiments because this protein was reported to enhance the ability of DOCK2 to activate Rac through binding to DOCK2 and thereby relieving the inhibition of its catalytic domain function (39Lu M. Kinchen J.M. Rossman K.L. Grimsley C. Hall M. Sondek J. Hengartner M.O. Yajnik V. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, Rac2, but not Cdc42, was strongly activated by co-expression of DOCK2 and ELMO1. Significantly, the R58C chimera was activated by DOCK2-ELMO1 to about 50% of the level seen with the wild-type Rac2 (histogram, compare lanes 6 with 1 and 8), whereas the reciprocal chimera C58R was not responsive (compare lanes 7 with 6 and 8). These observations suggested that divergent amino acid residues located in the 58-amino acid long N-proximal region of Rac2 are instrumental for activation by DOCK2-ELMO1. Notably, the R39C and C39R58C chimeras were severely defective for activation by DOCK2-ELMO1 (compare lanes 2 and 5 with 1 and 6). Together, the above observations indicated that divergent amino acid residues located in the β1 strand and/or switch 1 and in β2–β3 region of Rac2, or Cdc42, cooperate to mediate specific activation of these GTPases by their cognate CDM family GEFs. Divergent Amino Acid Residues in the Switch 1 Region and the β3 Strand of Rac2 Mediate Specific Activation by DOCK2To identify amino acid residues in Rac2 that mediate specific activation by DOCK2-ELMO1, divergent residues in the N-terminal region of this GTPase were substituted with the corresponding residues in Cdc42 (Rac2-to-Cdc42 substitutions). The mutant GTPases were tested for their abilities to bind to and be activated by DOCK2-ELMO1 as well as by DOCK9. The effects of Rac2-to-Cdc42 amino acid substitutions on the ability of Rac2 to bind DOCK2-ELMO1 and DOCK9 were assessed in pull-down assays. Wild-type and mutant myc-tagged Rac2 proteins were expressed in E. coli as GST fusions (GST-myc-GTPases). Purified GST-myc-GTPases were incubated with extracts prepared from HEK 293T cells ectopically expressing myc-tagged DOCK9, DOCK2, and ELMO1 and protein complexes precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the myc epitope. As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type GST-myc-Rac2 precipitated DOCK2 and ELMO1 but not DOCK9 (lane 1). Conversely, wild-type GST-myc-Cdc42 precipitated DOCK9 but not DOCK2 or ELMO1 (compare lanes 1 and 10). Thus, these data demonstrate that the specific binding of Rac2 and Cdc42 to their cognate CDM family GEFs is reproduced in pull-down assay. Interestingly, the pull-down assays identified three of the 14 divergent amino acid residues in the N-terminal region of Rac2 as major determinants of specific recognition by DOCK2-ELMO1. Rac2-to-Cdc42 substitution of alanine 27 (Ala-27) or glycine 30 (Gly-30), located in the N-proximal region of switch 1, or of tryptophan 56 (Trp-56), located in the β3 strand, severely compromised the ability of Rac2 to precipitate DOCK2 and ELMO1 (compare lanes 2, 3, and 7 with lane 1). We also tested the effects of substitutions of valine 51 (Val-51) and asparagine 52 (Asn-52) in the β3 strand, which we found to be important for the activation of Rac2 by DOCK2 (see below). However, these changes had little if any detectable effect on the ability of Rac2 to bind DOCK2-ELMO1 (compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 1). We concluded that divergent amino acid residues Ala-27 and Gly-30 in the switch 1 region and Trp-56 in the β3 strand of Rac2 are required for specific binding to DOCK2-ELMO1. Next, mutant Rac2 proteins were tested for their abilities to be activated by DOCK2-ELMO1. As shown in Fig. 3B, individual Rac2-to-Cdc42 substitutions for Ala-27, Gly-30, or Trp-56 significantly diminished Rac2 activation by DOCK2-ELMO1 (Fig. 3B, histogram, compare lanes 2, 3, and 7 with 1). Strikingly, mutating both Ala-27 and Gly-30 in the switch 1 region rendered Rac2 essentially unresponsive to DOCK2-ELMO1 (compare lane 4 with 1–3). Interestingly, Rac2-to-Cdc42 substitution of Val-51 or Asn-52 in the β3 region modestly decreased activation by DOCK2-ELMO1, even though neither of these changes detectably affected Rac2 binding to DOCK2-ELMO1 in pull-down assays (compare lanes 5 and 6 with 1; see Fig. 3A). The negative effects of the V51Y and N52T changes on Rac2 activation were more clearly seen when these substitutions were combined with the W56F change in Rac2-(VN51YT,W56F) (Fig. 3B histogram, compare lane 8 with 5–7). These observations indicated that divergent residues at positions 27 and 30 in the switch 1 region and those at positions 51, 52, and 56 in the β3 strand of Rac2 are critical for the specific activation of Rac2 by DOCK2-ELMO1. Although the Rac2-to-Cdc42-mutated Rac2 proteins did not detectably associate with DOCK9 in pull-down assays, we nevertheless, tested their abilities to be activated by DOCK9 in the transient expression assay in HEK 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, Rac2 GTPases with amino acid substitutions in the switch 1 region were not responsive to DOCK9. In contrast, Rac2-(W56F) and Rac2-(VN51YT,W56F) with changes in the β3 strand were m"

However, the purpose of GSK3β involvement in spindle microtubule assembly and accurate chromosome segregation remains obscure. Here, we report that GSK3β interacts with the spindle-associated protein Astrin both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, Astrin acts as a substrate for GSK3β and is phosphorylated at Thr-111, Thr-937 ((S/T)P motif) and Ser-974/Thr-978 ((S/T)XXX(S/T)-p motif; p is a phosphorylatable residue). Inhibition of GSK3β impairs spindle and kinetochore accumulation of Astrin and spindle formation at mitosis, suggesting that Astrin association with the spindle microtubule and kinetochore may be dependent on phosphorylation by GSK3β. Conversely, depletion of Astrin by small interfering RNA has no detectable influence on the localization of GSK3β. Interestingly, in vitro assays demonstrated that Astrin enhances GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of other substrates. Moreover, we showed that coexpression of Astrin and GSK3β differentially increases GSK3β-mediated Tau phosphorylation on an unprimed site. Collectively, these data indicate that GSK3β interacts with and phosphorylates the spindle-associated protein Astrin, resulting in targeting Astrin to the spindle microtubules and kinetochores.

GSK3 has two structurally similar isoforms in mammals, GSK3α and GSK3β, that are ubiquitously expressed and differ in their N- and C-terminal regions (2Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Earlier reports indicated that not only are the developmental profiles of GSK3α and GSK3β expression different but also the regulation and functions of these two proteins are not always identical (6Wang Q.M.

Factors known to influence the functions of GSK3β include the phosphorylation of GSK3β itself, the subcellular localization of GSK3β, the protein-protein interaction of GSK3β, and the phosphorylation state of GSK3β substrates (1Ali A.

Insulin-mediated inhibition of GSK3 was mediated through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, with the phosphorylation at position Ser-21 and Ser-9 in GSK3α and GSK3β, respectively (11Cohen P.

GSK3β also has a preference for pre-phosphorylated substrates, recognizing the consensus sequence (S/T)XXX(S/T)-p. In this sequence the first S/T residue is the target for GSK3β phosphorylation, X is any amino acid, P denotes the phosphorylatable residue, and the S/T located at the C terminus is the phosphorylation priming site (12Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14042-14048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a number of proteins, including Axin and Tau, are phosphorylated by GSK3β without pre-phosphorylation. Recombinant Tau is phosphorylated at Ser-396 by GSK3β directly at an (S/T)P motif (3Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem.

In fact, GSK3β phosphorylates many microtubule-associated proteins, including Tau, MAP1B, MAP2, APC, CRMP-2, and neurofilament, to regulate microtubule growth and stability and reduce their binding ability with microtubules (2Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar, 3Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem.

Therefore, establishing and dynamic balancing of the microtubules depends on spatial-temporal regulation by GSK3β activity. Microtubules (MTs) dynamics need to be controlled through the cell cycle, especially in spindle apparatus assembling for successfully segregating chromosomes. In mammals, GSK3β involvement has been reported in the polarized anchoring of MTs at the cell periphery (17Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other recent studies found that GSK3 β interacts with spindle apparatus during mitosis and accumulates at centrosomes and inhibiting GSK3β causes defects in extended astral microtubules and chromosome misalignment during mitosis (18Wakefield J.G. Stephens D.J. Tavare J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Tighe A. Ray-Sinha A. Staples O.D. Taylor S.S. BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, identifying the interacting partners and candidate substrates for GSK3β in spindle microtubule assembly has great importance. Astrin is a non-motor spindle-associated protein essential for cell cycle progression (20Chang M.S. Huang C.J. Chen M.L. Chen S.T. Fan C.C. Chu J.M. Lin W.C. Yang Y.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This protein has a large coiled-coil domain at its C terminus and forms dimers or high order structures under physiological conditions (22Gruber J. Harborth J. Schnabel J. Weber K. Hatzfeld M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4053-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Astrin-depleted cells exhibit centrosome instability and malformation of the spindle, leading to mitosis arrest and subsequent apoptosis (20Chang M.S. Huang C.J. Chen M.L. Chen S.T.

Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1710-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A recent study also showed that in the absence of Astrin, kinetochore-microtubule attachments are impaired, leading to premature sister chromatid separation and centriole disengagement (24Thein K.H. Kleylein-Sohn J. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that Astrin is important to spindle apparatus organization and chromosome segregation. To explore the molecular targets for GSK3β that are involved in spindle microtubule assembly and accurate chromosome segregation, this investigation used a biochemical approach to search for proteins that specifically interact with GSK3β. This work presents a conceptual framework linking GSK3β and spindle-associated protein Astrin and shows that the association of Astrin with spindle MTs and kinetochore requires GSK3β kinase. In particular, the GSK3β-Astrin complex increases GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation on unprimed sites, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be a recurring theme in spindle regulation. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, streptomycin, and Lipofectamine™ were purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmid Constructions—Astrin fragments were amplified from plasmid DNA by PCR, cloned into pAS2-1 (Clontech), and completely sequenced. Plasmids pET-Astrin, pET-Astrin aa 1-608, pET-Astrin aa 609-1193, aa pET-Astrin 1-478, and pET-Astrin aa 479-1193, which express His-tagged Astrin, His-tagged N terminus-Astrin (corresponding to amino acids 1-608), His-tagged C terminus-Astrin (corresponding to amino acids 609-1193), His-tagged Astrin aa 1-478, and His-tagged Astrin aa 479-1193 in Escherichia coli BL21/(DE3), respectively, were constructed by inserting Astrin DNA fragments into the BamHI and XhoI sites, BamHI and EcoRI sites and EcoRI and XhoI sites of pET-32a (Novagen). Plasmid pcDNA-Astrin, pcDNA-Astrin aa 479-1193, and pcDNA-Astrin aa 609-1193 express hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Astrin, HA-tagged Astrin aa 479-1193, and HA-tagged Astrin aa 609-1193, respectively. Plasmid GFP-Astrin, which expresses GFP-tagged Astrin protein, was constructed using the pEGFPC2 vector (Clontech) ligated at the restriction sites BglII and XhoI. Human GSK3β was fused to the GAL4 transcription activation domain by subcloning into the pACT2 vector. Plasmid pGEX-GSK3β encodes a GST-tagged GSK3β fusion protein. Plasmid pCMV-FLAG-GSK3β, which expresses FLAG-tagged GSK3β, was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified GSK3β DNA fragment into pCMV-FLAG. To determine the correctness of all cloned sequences, nucleotide sequencing was performed by ABI PRISM™ 3730 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Yeast Two-hybrid System—Standard techniques were used for the yeast two-hybrid system (25Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 26Chien C.T.

Biol. 1997; 63: 173-196PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the Astrin gene fragments were cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pAS2-1 vector (MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System, Clontech). The human GSK3β was fused to the GAL4 transcription activation domain by subcloning into the pACT2 vector (MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System). Yeast YRG-2 (Stratagene) was co-transformed with the pAS2-1-Astrin plasmid DNA (GAL4 BD) and pACT2-GSK3β plasmid DNA (GAL4 AD). Positive clones were selected based on the ability of the cells to grow on Trp, Leu, and His dropout media supplemented with 3-aminotriazole (an inhibitor of HIS3) together with a blue colony color by β-galactosidase filter assay. GST Pulldown Assay—E. coli BL21(DE3) (pGEX-GSK3β) was cultured in 3 ml of LB medium at 37 °C to the mid-log phase. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the expression of GST fusion proteins. After culturing for 3 h, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in 100 μl of a lysis buffer, B-Per (Pierce), containing 10 μl of leupeptin, aprotinin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was centrifuged again at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C with a T15A22 rotor in a HITACHI CF R15 centrifuge. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) were then added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated under shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After washing, the beads were added to the lysate (300 μl) prepared from E. coli lysate containing His-tagged Astrin proteins. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 1h to allow binding between a GST-GSK3β protein and His-tagged Astrin proteins, including His-Astrin, His-Astrin aa 1-608, or His-Astrin aa 609-1193. The beads were subsequently washed with NETN buffer. An equal volume of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer was then added to the mixture, and proteins were extracted from the beads by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were finally analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells (1 × 107) transfected with pcDNA-Astrin and pCMV-FLAG-GSK3β were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The lysate was prepared by adding 1 ml of immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) to the cells. Then the lysate was centrifuged using a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was added to anti-FLAG antibody (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein-A/G-agarose beads (30 μl) (Calbiochem) were added to the lysate, and the mixture was incubated with shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were finally collected by centrifugation and washed three times with immunoprecipitation assay buffer. Proteins binding to the beads were eluted by adding 20 μl of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hemagglutinin antibody. For native immunoprecipitation assays, cells were synchronized in different phases of the cell cycle and lysed by immunoprecipitation assay buffer. After immunoprecipitation, the proteins were pooled and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed either by the anti-Astrin antibody or by the anti-hNinein antibody. Cell Culture, Synchronization, RNA Interference and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin and streptomycin (1100 IU/ml and 100 mg/ml, respectively). For synchronization, cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) or 200 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma). RNA interference mediated by duplexes of 21-nt RNAs was performed on human HeLa cells as described previously (54Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T.

The following siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were used: Astrin sense 5′-CUACAGAGCCUGACUCUCUtt and anti-sense 5′-GAGAGUCAGGCUCUGUAGtt (22Gruber J. Harborth J. Schnabel J. Weber K. Hatzfeld M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4053-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Ambion). A scrambled siRNA duplex was used as the negative control (Ambion). For transient transfection studies, HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at a density of 8 × 105 cells per well in a 12-well plate. Transfection with plasmid DNA and duplex RNA was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—After transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 25 °C followed by methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. The fixed cells were probed with rabbit anti-hNinein serum (1:500, our preparation), rabbit anti-Astrin antibody (1:500, our preparation), mouse anti-Astrin antibody (1:500, our preparation), rabbit anti-Aurora A (1:500, our preparation), rabbit anti-pericentrin (1:500, Abcam), mouse anti-BubR1 (1:250, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-CENP-E (1:250, Abcam), mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibody (1:1000; GTU-88, Sigma), and mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:1000; DM 1A, Sigma). DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml). Immunofluorescent cell images were acquired using an Olympus LSM Fluoview 500 Confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus). Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems). All data were collected during the same session to avoid potential differences due to fading. Images were then measured for area and total pixel number for each image by circumscribing spindle contours and selecting that region for quantitation. Pixel number was obtained by multiplying the selected area by pixel intensity. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—The cell extracts were prepared in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100,10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of total lysates were used for further analyses or loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE, which changed the acrylamide:bis ratio from 37:1 to 100:1, and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were incubated with the membrane at the titer of 1:1000 to 1:2500 at 4 °C for 2 h. The membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 10 min, repeated 3 times. Secondary antibodies against mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing with 0.1% Tween 20 for 3 × 30 min. Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added to develop the membrane. Kinase Reaction—The His-tagged Astrin proteins were incubated with recombinant GSK3β (25 units, New England Biolabs) in the kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) with or without [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) at 30 °C for 30 min followed by autoradiography. To demonstrate whether protein phosphorylation but not other post-translational modifications caused the electrophoretic mobility shift, λ-phosphatase (100 units per reaction, New England Biolabs) was used to verify this finding. Identification of Astrin as a Novel GSK3β-interacting Protein—To elucidate the functions of GSK3β in MT assembly, this study investigated whether GSK3β and Astrin form a complex in the spindle apparatus. A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed with recombinant activation domain-tagged GSK3β and binding domain-tagged Astrin, which showed that GSK3β interacts strongly with Astrin (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the assay was performed with deleted Astrin and revealed that an N-terminal coiled-coil region, encompassing residues 481-608, interacted with the GSK3β (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, no interaction was observed between GSK3α, a protein similar to GSK3β, and Astrin. We, therefore, conclude that Astrin binding to GSK3β is specific. To confirm the interaction between GSK3β and Astrin in vitro, recombinant GSK3β was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with purified hexahistidine (His6)-tagged Astrin or fragments of Astrin, amino acids 1-608 or 609-1193. His-tagged Astrin or His-tagged Astrin aa 1-608 was specifically pulled down by GSK3β in vitro (Fig. 1B). We next examined whether GSK3β and Astrin interact with each other in physiological condition. Lysates were prepared from HeLa cells at interphase or mitotic phase of the cell cycle, which were monitored using the expression of cyclins as an indicator. Immunoblot analysis revealed that both GSK3β and Astrin were coimmunoprecipitated by anti-GSK3β antibody but not by anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1C), indicating that these two proteins interact in vivo. To compare the subcellular localization of these two proteins more directly, double indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed on HeLa cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that during interphase, GSK3β and Astrin were diffused in the cell. In mitotic cells, when cells progressed from prophase to anaphase, accumulation of GSK3β and Astrin at the spindle apparatus was observed (Fig. 2). When the cell entered the telophase, GSK3β and Astrin did not form assemblies at the midbody, although some Astrin appeared at the midbody. This suggests that complex formation between GSK3β and Astrin is enhanced in the presence of spindle apparatus.FIGURE 2Astrin and GSK3β interact and co-localize at the spindle during prophase to anaphase of the cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized at the indicated cell cycle stages by double thymidine block and release. Cells were stained with antibodies against Astrin (green) and GSK3β (red). All images merged together with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of DNA (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Astrin Is a Substrate of GSK3β—To investigate whether Astrin is a substrate of GSK3β, in vitro kinase assays were performed. Assays were carried out using His-tagged Astrin, His-tagged Astrin aa 903-1193 (coiled-coil II domain), His-tagged Astrin aa 481-902 (coiled-coil I domain), or His-tagged Astrin aa 1-481 (N-terminal head region) as substrates incubated with GSK3β in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Labeling results showed that His-tagged Astrin, His-tagged Astrin aa 903-1193, and His-tagged Astrin aa 1-481 were phosphorylated by GSK3β. No incorporation of 32P into the His-tagged Astrin aa 481-902 was observed (Fig. 3A). These data demonstrate that Astrin is phosphorylated by GSK3β in vitro in two regions in Astrin, from amino acids 1 to 481 and 903 to 1193. A recent phosphoproteome analysis of the human mitotic spindle also detected the presence of certain phosphorylation sites on Astrin, the phosphorylation region of which is the same as those observed in the present study (13 sites locate at N-terminal region aa 1-481 and 1 site locate at C-terminal region aa 903-1193) in the presence of two potential GSK3β phosphorylation sites (29Nousiainen M. Sillje H.H. Sauer G. Nigg E.A. Korner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5391-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B, cluster I and II, upper panel). These two sites, Thr-111 and Thr-937, were related to the proline directed motif, (S/T)P motif. It is also reported that GSK3β phosphorylation site consisted of a priming motif, (S/T)XXX(S/T)-p. Based on this motif algorithm, cluster III consists of a set of two Ser/Thr residues, designated Ser-974 and Thr-978. To verify that GSK3β indeed phosphorylated these predicted Astrin sites, T111A, T937A, S974A/T978A, or T937A/S974A/T978A, with candidate serine/threonine sites altered to alanines, were constructed. Compared with wild-type Astrin, the phosphorylation by GSK3β of the four mutants was reduced (Fig. 3B, middle panel). These results provide strong evidence for direct phosphorylation of Astrin by GSK3β. The effects of these mutants on GSK3β phosphorylation of Astrin were quantitated, normalized, and expressed as percentages as shown in Fig. 3B, lower panel, suggesting that GSK3β phosphorylates Astrin at these motifs. To further determine the relevance of these phosphorylation sites, HeLa cells were transfected with either wild-type GFP-tagged Astrin or GFP-tagged Astrin 4A, which contains quadruple mutations of Thr-111/Thr-937/Ser-974/Thr-978 mutated to alanine. Meanwhile, the spindles were detected by immunostaining with α-tubulin antibody. Confocal microscopy revealed GFP-tagged Astrin at the spindle apparatus, overlapping with α-tubulin. The GFP-tagged Astrin 4A was still present primarily at the spindle apparatus, whereas the cell displayed an abnormal spindle morphology (Fig. 3C). We next investigated whether the phosphorylation of Astrin could be also detected in vivo. HeLa cells were synchronized at mitosis with nocodazole. Astrin protein derived from mitotic cells migrated slower in an SDS-PAGE than did that from interphase cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, the protein from the mitotic cell migrated as fast as that from the interphase cell after the protein was treated with λ-phosphatase (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that Astrin was phosphorylated in mitotic cells. To determine that Astrin is phosphorylated by GSK3β during the mitotic phase, we cultured HeLa cells in a medium that contained LiCl or SB-415286 (30Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) to inhibit the function of GSK3β and reveal the level of Astrin. The data showed that mitotic Astrin exhibited slower migration in SDS-PAGE which was significantly reduced by the treatment with GSK3β inhibitors (Fig. 4B, lanes 4-6), indicating that Astrin was phosphorylated by GSK3β at mitosis. Because the inhibition of GSK3β reduced the phosphorylation of Astrin, little alteration in the total Astrin levels were seen, whereas α-tubulin was analyzed as a loading control. We also noted that LiCl or SB-415286 treatment induces cyclin B1 levels in asynchronous cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that inhibiting GSK3β activity induced cell arrest in G2/M phases. GSK3β Kinase Activity Is Essential for the Spindle Localization of Astrin—To assess more clearly whether Astrin phosphorylation by GSK3β is required for localization at the spindle apparatus, we used GSK3β inhibitors and analyzed the mitotic Astrin localization. The α-tubulin and γ-tubulin were used to define the spindle MTs structure and centrosome position. HeLa cells were synchronized at G2/M by thymidine-nocodazole treatment and then treated with either Me2SO or GSK3β inhibitors, LiCl and SB-415286. Me2SO-treated cells at the metaphase presented primarily with bipolar mitotic spindle, two spindle poles/centrosome/cell, and normal localization of Astrin or centrosomal proteins (Fig. 5A). LiCl-treated cells and SB-415286-treated cells frequently presented a spindle organization defect such as spindle organize asymmetry with the site of maximum spindle intensity within one pole (Fig. 5, B and C). We also found that inhibiting the GSK3β kin"

Rho GTPases belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and act as molecular switches by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. They are involved in the regulation of some of the most fundamental processes of cell biology common to all eukaryotes, including the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the regulation of signaling pathways that control cell morphology, polarity, adhesion, and movement (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases mediate a diverse set of cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and intracellular traffic. As each of these functions is important for the initiation and progression of cancer, Rho GTPases appear to be promising targets for anti-tumoral drugs (2Fritz G. Kaina B. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). RhoB, in contrast with its close relatives RhoA and RhoC, plays a negative role in oncogenesis and may thus act as a tumor suppressor (3Huang M. Prendergast G.C. Histol. Histopathol. 2006; 21: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of RhoB decreases with increasing tumor aggressiveness in lung cancers, head and neck carcinomas, and glioblastomas (4Adnane J. Seijo E. Chen Z. Bizouarn F. Leal M. Sebti S.M.

First, unlike most of the small GTPases, RhoB has a short half-life (16Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).

Second, compared with other prenylated Rho GTPases that are exclusively farnesylated or geranylgeranylated, RhoB has been reported to be both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated in vivo (27Adamson P.

Third, RhoB is associated with the plasma membrane and with early endosomes and pre-lysosomal compartments, whereas RhoA and RhoC appear to be mainly cytoplasmic (10Milia J. Teyssier F. Dalenc F.

Consistent with its endosomal location, RhoB modulates the traffic of several receptors through the endocytic system (30Ellis S. Mellor H.

Hordijk P. Neefjes J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2661-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, RhoB has also been implicated in the intracellular trafficking of AKT (38Adini I. Rabinovitz I. Sun J.F. Prendergast G.C. Benjamin L.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2721-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and in controlling the outward movement of Src to the plasma membrane (39Sandilands E. Cans C. Fincham V.J. Brunton V.G.

Taken together, these findings highlight the important role that RhoB plays in the subcellular targeting of signaling molecules. However, the molecular mechanisms by which RhoB modulates endosomal trafficking and exerts such myriad effects remain largely unclear. To elucidate the role of RhoB in these intracellular processes, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify effector proteins that interact specifically with RhoB. This screen identified LC2, the light chain associated with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1A, as a novel binding partner for RhoB. LC2 was characterized as a subunit of MAP1A, and MAP1A/LC2 has been determined to be an adaptor protein that facilitates the interaction of MAP1A with other signal transduction components or structural proteins (40Halpain S. Dehmelt L. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The ability of MAP1A/LC2 to interact with RhoB provides new insights into the involvement of RhoB and the microtubule cytoskeleton in the mechanisms underlying the controlled subcellular targeting of signaling molecules.

Standard PCR procedures were used to insert restriction sites into plasmids for cloning. Truncated cDNAs were generated using oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Constructs–The cDNA encoding the bait RhoBv14Δ4 was inserted into pGBKT7 vector (Clontech) in-frame at the 3′ end of a Gal4 DNA-binding domain; the cDNAs encoding RhoBv14Δ4, RhoBwtΔ4, or RhoBwtΔ18 were inserted into the pLex12Tetra plasmid (a generous gift of Dr. J. Camonis, Institut Curie, France). Plasmids encoding CAAX (where A is aliphatic amino acid) box deleted, constitutively active Rho GTPases (RhoA, RhoC, RhoG, Rac1, Cdc42, TC10, and TCL) fused to LexA-BD in pBTM116 were kindly provided by Dr. A. Blangy (CRBM-CNRS, France). Bacterial Expression Vectors–The cDNAs encoding RhoAv14 or RhoBv14 were inserted into the pGSTparallel2 vector from Dr. P. Sheffield (41Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), in-frame at the 3′ of glutathione S-transferase. RhoB C-terminal hypervariable coding regions were inserted after PCR amplification into pGSTparallel2 vector. Mammalian Expression Vectors–Myc-tagged LC2 cDNA and HA-tagged RhoB cDNAs were inserted into pIRESpuro2 (Clontech). The bait plasmid pGBKT7-RhoBv14Δ4 was introduced into yeast strain AH109 by the lithium acetate-mediated method, and concentrated overnight culture of yeast expressing the bait protein was mated to a yeast culture of strain Y187 containing a pretransformed human brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library constructed in pACT2 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Growth on medium lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ade, and a β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay were used to isolate cDNAs encoding candidate interacting proteins, following the Yeast Protocols Handbook instructions (Clontech). Gal4-BD or Gal4-BD-lamin fusions were used as negative control baits. For the yeast two-hybrid binary assays performed using the LexA-based two-hybrid system, the prey vector pACT2/LC2 was cotransformed with pBTM116-RhoGTPase constructs into the L40 yeast strain, using the lithium acetate method. Transformants were plated onto a Trp- and Leu-deficient medium and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. A colony-lift filter assay was used to detect β-galactosidase activity, according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook instructions (Clontech). Observation of a blue color within 4 h was considered a positive result. HeLa (human carcinoma ATCC CCL-2) and U87-MG cells (human glioblastoma ATCC HTB-14) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in either growth medium or serum-free media for 24 h before experiments with additions of EGF (Sigma) or GGTI-298 (Calbiochem), lovastatin (Sigma), or R115777 (Janssen). Transfection experiments were performed using jetPEI (PolyPlus) for plasmids and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for siRNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNAs against MAP1A (siMAP1A-1 and siMAP1A-2, respectively, 5′-CGGAGGUUUGAGGACUUUATT-3′ and 5′-CGUGAGUGGUACCAACAAAATT-3′) were designed and synthesized as oligonucleotides by Qiagen. siRNA against RhoB (siRhoB) was described previously (24Skuli N. Monferran S. Delmas C. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Favre G. Toulas C. Cohen-Jonathan-Moyal E. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For control siRNA (siControl) a nonspecific sequence (5′-ACUCUAUCUGCACGCUGACUU-3′) synthesized by Eurogentec was used as a control. For the GST pulldown assays, the GST fusion protein was induced overnight in 1 liter of Escherichia coli BL21 cells by addition of 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After centrifugation and freezing, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors (Sigma). After centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was bound to 500 μl of pre-washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer, and the purity of the bound GST fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Transfected myc-LC2 HeLa cell lysate (1 mg) or brain extract (100 μg) was added to 10 μg of GST-Rho beads in 500 μl of bacterial lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice with interaction buffer, resuspended directly in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS electrophoresis and Western blot with anti-Myc or anti-MAP1A antibodies. For GTP or GDP loading, GST-Rho beads were preincubated with 10 μm GDP or GTPγS in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA at 30 °C and then washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 before incubation with the cell lysate used for GST pulldown assays. For analysis of the level of activated RhoB, GTP-bound RhoB protein was measured using the method initially described by Ren et al. (42Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) using the GST fusion protein containing the Rho binding domain of the downstream effector rhotekin and adapted to RhoB (33Gampel A. Mellor H. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amount of GTP-bound RhoB and the total amount of RhoB in cell lysates was determined by Western blot using polyclonal anti-RhoB antibodies. For brain extract, adult mouse brains were homogenized in 100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). For cell extracts, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors). After centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation experiments, cell extract (500 μg) from cells transfected with myc-LC2 or 2.5 mg of U87 cell lysate was incubated with monoclonal anti-RhoB antibody (4 μg) and with 50 μl of magnetic anti-mouse IgG (Dynal) for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-RhoB or anti-Myc antibodies. For U87 experiments, NuPAGE™ 4-12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) were used and immunoblotted with anti-MAP1A and anti-RhoB antibodies. For cell fractionation, transfected cells (4 × 107) were resuspended in homogenization buffer (8% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, and protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)), and endosomal fractions were prepared on discontinuous sucrose gradient as described previously (43Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). For visualization of proteins on Western blots, the ECL Western blotting substrate detection system was used (Pierce). Data shown were representative at least of three separate experiments. U87 or HeLa myc-LC2 transfected cells were plated onto acid-washed glass coverslips and fixed 24 h later for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and then washed with PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then washed again in PBS, incubated with 0.1% sodium borohydride for 10 min, and then with PBS containing 3% BSA for 30 min. The cells were rinsed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies in PBS plus 1% BSA and then with secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature in PBS, 1% BSA. After rinsing, cells were mounted on slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Images were taken with an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Yena, Germany) using a sequential mode of acquisition with a 63× 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. The green channel was acquired using the 488 Ar+ laser line and detected between 505 and 545 nm; the red channel was acquired using the 633 nm HeNe laser line and detected between 645 and 760 nm. Using the sequential mode and spectral separation allowed us to avoid any bleed through in the red channel and ensured correct colocalization. Colocalization of RhoB with MAP1A or α-tubulin was quantified using Metamorph Imaging System software package (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) At least 10 fields were quantified for each staining. The percent colocalization is indicative of the area of RhoB-stained fluorescent pixels overlapping that of cytoskeleton markers. Visualization of spatial correlation was done by graphing the intensity values of those markers along a given line with separate traces for red and green components, using Metamorph software. Identification of LC2 as a Specific RhoB Partner Using the Yeast Two-hybrid System–In an attempt to identify RhoB effector proteins, we employed a two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library with RhoBv14Δ4 as bait; this construct is equivalent to the constitutively active Val-12 mutation in Ras and lacks the C-terminal CAAX motif to prevent prenylation modification in yeast cells during the experiments. RhoBv14Δ4 was fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD) and used as a bait to screen a human brain cDNA library fused to a Gal4-activating domain. Approximately, 2 × 106 independent clones were screened. Of the 43 colonies that grew on selective medium, 23 clones were positive in the β-galactosidase selection assay. These 23 clones were tested in binary two-hybrid experiments against Gal4-BD-RhoBv14Δ4 as well as against Gal4-BD or Gal4-BD-lamin as control baits. We obtained six confirmed positive clones; after sequencing, four independent clones were found to have the identical cDNA sequence. The cDNA sequence was 2133 nucleotides in length with an open reading frame of 729 nucleotides, coding for 241 amino acids (Fig. 1). A computer BLAST search in the human GenBank™ data base revealed that this cDNA sequence encoded the 241 C-terminal amino acids of microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A), and corresponded to its associated light chain (LC2). MAP1A/LC2 is translated as a polyprotein precursor (44Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Muller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is proteolytically cleaved into the heavy and the light chains (45Togel M. Eichinger R. Wiche G. Propst F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the interaction of the constitutively active form of RhoB with LC2, we performed a binary two-hybrid association assay using wild-type RhoBΔ4 fused with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We found that LC2 interacted more strongly with the constitutively active form of RhoB (Gal4-BD-RhoBv14Δ4) than with wild-type RhoB (Gal4-BD-RhoBwtΔ4) (Table 1). Because the primary structure of Rho GTPases is highly conserved and the proteins are at least 50-55% homologous to each other, we performed yeast two-hybrid binary association assays using several Rho family members as baits cloned into a LexA-BD plasmid, which is known to be more specific than the Gal4-BD system. Despite the high degree of amino acid sequence homology between different Rho family members, only the constitutively active form of RhoB (LexA-BD-RhoBv14D4) interacted with LC2 in the yeast two-hybrid system, whereas no interaction was detected with the constitutively active mutants of CAAX-deleted RhoA, RhoC, RhoG, Rac1, Cdc42, TC10, and TCL (Table 1). RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC have around 90% amino acid homology, with the most divergence in the hypervariable domain that includes the 18 C-terminal amino acids. We thus tested the hypothesis that this C-terminal region could be involved in interaction of LC2 with RhoB. Deletion of this region completely abolished the interaction with LC2 in the two-hybrid assay (Table 1), demonstrating the critical role these 18 C-terminal amino acids play in the specificity of the LC2/RhoB interaction.TABLE 1Yeast two-hybrid interactions Yeast two-hybrid interactions between RhoB and LC2. Yeast AH109 or L40 cells were cotransformed with expression vectors encoding Gal-4 or the LexA DNA-binding and activation domains fused with indicated protein.

To this end, a Myc tag was added at the N terminus of LC2, and the fusion protein was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Recombinant GST-RhoBv14 protein was produced in E. coli and then bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with myc-LC2-expressing HeLa cell lysate. As shown in Fig. 2A, immunoblotting with anti-Myc (labeled HeLa-mycLC2) showed that LC2 interacted strongly with GST-RhoBv14 beads, weakly with GST-RhoAv14 beads, and did not interact with the GST beads negative control. Because LC2 is associated with the MAP1A heavy chain in vivo (46Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether RhoB also interacts with LC2 in its MAP1A heavy chain-associated form. To this end, mouse brain extracts containing large amounts of MAP1A (47Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated with GST-RhoBV14 beads in GST pulldown experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A (labeled Brain), immunoblotting with anti-MAP1A antibody revealed a specific band corresponding to endogenous MAP1A when brain extracts were incubated with GST-RhoBv14 beads. No signal was detected when brain extracts were incubated with GST-RhoAv14 beads or control GST beads. To verify that the interaction between MAP1A/LC2 and RhoB was dependent on the GTP loading of RhoB, we preincubated GST-RhoB beads with 10 μm GDP or GTPγS before incubation with cell lysate. Fig. 2B shows that the GTP-bound form, but not the GDP-bound form, of RhoB interacted with LC2 in myc-LC2-expressing HeLa cell lysate or MAP1A in brain extracts. This indicates that the interaction was highly dependent on GTP loading. To analyze the role of the RhoB C-terminal domain in the RhoB/LC2 interaction using a GST pulldown assay, we generated a C-terminal deletion of GST-RhoBv14. Recombinant GST-RhoBv14Δ18 protein was produced and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. We showed that the deletion of the 18 C-terminal amino acids of RhoB resulted in a weak interaction with LC2 in HeLa-myc LC2 extract and with MAP1A in brain extract (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the C terminus is required for the interaction with MAP1A/LC2.

https://openalex.org/W1973803669,"Defects in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) are the molecular basis of certain cancers, including hematological malignancies. The defects are often caused by mutations in coding regions of MMR genes or promoter methylation of the genes. However, in many cases, despite that a hypermutable phenotype is detected in a patient, no mutations/hypermethylations of MMR genes can be detected. We report here a novel mechanism that a mutation in the MLH1 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) leads to MMR deficiency. A relapsed leukemia patient displayed microsatellite instability, but no genetic and epigenetic alterations in key MMR genes were identifiable. Instead, a 3-nucleotide (TTC) deletion in the MLH1 3′-UTR was found in the patient's blood sample. The mutant MLH1 3′-UTR was found to significantly reduce the expressions of both a firefly luciferase reporter gene and an ectopic MLH1 gene in model cell lines. Consistent with these observations, a significant reduction in the steady-state level of MLH1 mRNA was observed in white blood cells of the patient. These findings suggest that the mutant MLH1 3′-UTR can cause a severely reduced/defective MMR activity conferring leukemia relapse, likely by down-regulating MLH1 expression at the mRNA level. Although the exact mechanism by which the mutant 3′-UTR down-regulates the MLH1 mRNA is not known, our findings provide a novel marker for cancers with MMR defects.

Genetic instability is considered both a hallmark of cancer and a pre-disposing condition that can lead to cancer. Multiple cellular mechanisms exist to prevent genetic instability, including a highly complex DNA damage response network and several DNA repair pathways.

The MMR system relies on the highly conserved MutS homolog (MSH) and MutL homolog (MLH) proteins for its function. In humans, at least three MSH genes (MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6) and four MLH genes (MLH1, MLH3, PMS1, and PMS2) have been identified. The MSH gene products form the MSH2-MSH6 (also called MutSα) and MSH2-MSH3 (MutSβ) heterodimers, whereas the MLH gene products constitute heterodimers of MLH1-PMS2 (MutLα), MLH1-PMS1 (MutLβ), and MLH1-MLH3 (MutLγ) (1Li G.M. Front Biosci. 2003; 8: 997-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The importance of MMR in maintaining genomic stability is underscored by the fact that defects in this system are the genetic basis of certain types of hereditary and sporadic human cancers, including hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) (1Li G.M. Front Biosci. 2003; 8: 997-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Lynch H.T. de la Chapelle A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 3Modrich P.

Interestingly, despite that all above MSH and MLH genes are implicated in MMR, almost all MMR deficient cancers are associated with alterations in MSH2 and MLH1 (2Lynch H.T. de la Chapelle A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 3Modrich P. Lahue R. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) characterized by either genetic mutations in these genes or hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter, which epigenetically silences the MLH1 expression (1Li G.M. Front Biosci. 2003; 8: 997-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The selectively targeting on MSH2 and MLH1 for alterations in HNPCC and other MMR deficient cancers appears to be consistent with the fact MSH2 or MLH1 is an obligating subunit in each of the MutS and MutL heterodimers, whereas the other MSH and MLH components are functionally redundant (5Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Tumor cells defective in MMR display a genome-wide mutator phenotype, e.g. frequent alterations in simple repetitive DNA sequences, a phenomenon called microsatellite instability (MSI) (2Lynch H.T. de la Chapelle A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 3Modrich P. Lahue R. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). However, not all cancer cells with MSI have identifiable mutations or epigenetic modifications in MMR genes (6Gu L. Cline-Brown B. Zhang F. Qiu L. Li G.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5758-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Chung D.C. Rustgi A.K. Ann. Int. Med. 2003; 138: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Rustgi A.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3049-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For example, ∼30% of MSI-positive HNPCC tumors are not associated with genetic or epigenetic alterations in any of the above MMR genes (2Lynch H.T. de la Chapelle A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional mechanisms are responsible for MMR deficiency in these MSI-positive tumors. In this study, we demonstrate that a 3-nucleotide deletion in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of MLH1 is associated with a relapsed leukemia patient displaying a mutator phenotype identical to cells defective in MMR. The mutant MLH1 3′-UTR appears to destabilize MLH1 mRNA and reduce MLH1 expression. Although exactly how the mutant MLH1 3′-UTR destabilizes MLH1 transcripts is unknown, the implication of this result for regulation of MMR in eukaryotic cells is discussed. Our findings here reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which the MMR system can be impaired. Patient and Patient SamplesPatient AML0805 was diagnosed as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with cytogenetics showing a 45, XY, t(8, 21)(q22;q22), del(9) (q22q32) karyotype on August, 2005 at the University of Kentucky Hospital and treated with standard “7 + 3” cytarabine plus idarubicin in which the patient went into complete remission (including negative FISH for t(8, 21). This was followed by four courses of high dose cytarabine as postinduction therapy. However, the patient relapsed on June, 2006. Whole blood samples were obtained from the diagnostic (AML0805) and the relapsed patient (AML0606) according to an approved Institute Review Board protocol. Whole blood cells were fractionated by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation, and the mononuclear white blood cell compartment was isolated and used to prepare genomic DNA and RNA using the FlexiGene DNA kit or QIAamp RNA blood mini kit (Qiagen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and TransfectionHeLa-S3 and 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% balanced air at 37 °C and transfected using FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) at a 3:2 ratio of transfection reagent (μl) to DNA (μg). Single-strand Conformation Polymorphism and DNA SequencingMutations in the 3′-UTR of the MLH1 gene were screened using PCR-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing, essentially as described (9Murata H. Khattar N.H. Kang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5696-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Mao G. Pan X. Zhu B.B. Zhang Y. Yuan F. Huang J. Lovell M.A. Lee M.P. Markesbery W.R. Li G.M. Gu L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PCR primers ex19F (CAAA CAGGGAGGCTTATGA) and ex19R (AAATAA GAAATTATGTTAAGACACATC) and 3′-utrF (CGCGCTCGAGATATGGTTATTTATGCACTGTGG) and 3′utrR (CCCACTACGTGCAGAGCCT GTGACATGTTCAAGA) were used to amplify part of exon 19 and the upstream sequence of the 3′-UTR and the downstream sequences of the 3′-UTR (see Fig. 2A), respectively. Construction and Expression of the Luciferase Reporter with Wild-type and Mutant MLH1 3′%Wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT) MLH1 3′-UTR were cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3 vector to produce pLuc+ WT-3′-UTR and pLuc+MT-3′-UTR, respectively. The SV40 late poly(A) signal and SV40 enhancer in the pGL3 vector were deleted during this cloning step. The constructs were co-transfected with a Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK; Promega Corp.) into HeLa-S3 cells (∼2.5 × 105), and the transfected cells were allowed to grow for 48 h prior to harvest. Luciferase expression was quantified using the Dual-Glo™ luciferase assay system and a Lumat luminometer (Lumat; EG&G Berthold). A relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing the firefly luminescence to the Renilla luminescence. The pGL3 vector was used as a positive control, and the promoterless pGL3 vector was used as a negative control. Construction and Expression of MLH1 with WT and MT 3′-UTRThe MLH1 gene was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/His C vector (Invitrogen), generating pcDNA3.1/HisC-MLH1. The WT and MT MLH1 3′-UTR amplified from genomic DNA derived from the patient's diagnostic or relapsed blood samples, respectively, were cloned downstream of the MLH1 gene in pcDNA3.1/HisC-MLH1 to generate pc-WT MLH1 3′-UTR and pc-MT MLH1 3′-UTR. The bovine growth hormone poly(A) sequence was deleted from the plasmid during this cloning step. The constructs were transfected into 293T cells, which were defective in MLH1 because of promoter hypermethylation, and MLH1 expression in each vector was determined by Western blot using a chemiluminescent system (GE Healthcare). Analysis of mRNA Stability293T cells were transiently transfected with pGL3 containing WT/MT 3′-UTR in 24-well plates. 24 h later, the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of actinomycin D (Sigma) to stop the transcription of the reporter gene. Cell aliquots were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h after the treatment. Total RNA was extracted from the treated cells and employed to prepare the first-strand cDNA using TaqMan® reverse transcription regents (Applied Biosystems) and random hexamer primers. Both the luciferase mRNA and β-actin mRNA were amplified from the cDNA using regular and real-time quantitative RT-PCR in a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA level in each case was measured using the power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The luciferase mRNA level was normalized with that of β-actin mRNA by dividing the fluorescence emission intensity of the luciferase reporter with that of β-actin at the threshold cycle (CT). The stability of MLH1 mRNA was determined similarly using total RNA (1 μg) derived from patient samples after treatment with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min. MSI AnalysisFive standard microsatellite markers from five different chromosomes (CHLC.GGAA4D07, D8S135, MfD257, ACTC, GGAA2E02) were used to determine MSI in AML0805 and AML0606 as described (9Murata H. Khattar N.H. Kang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5696-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Mao G. Pan X. Zhu B.B. Zhang Y. Yuan F. Huang J. Lovell M.A. Lee M.P. Markesbery W.R. Li G.M. Gu L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, frameshift mutations in mononucleotide runs in exon 2 of CASPASE-5 and intron 5 of FANCD2 were investigated using the primers and conditions reported elsewhere (11Offman J. Gascoigne K. Bristow F. Macpherson P. Bignami M. Casorelli I. Leone G. Pagano L. Sica S. Halil O. Cummins D. Banner N.R. Karran P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Statistical AnalysisData from dual-luciferase assays and real-time quantitative PCR were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software). Mean values (±S.D.) were calculated. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance, and post-test was processed using Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests. Data were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Identification of a Mutator Phenotype in a Relapsed Leukemia PatientWe recently investigated the impact of MMR deficiency on diagnostic and relapsed leukemia and provided compelling evidence showing that loss of MMR function is closely associated with leukemia relapse (12Mao, G., Yuan, F., Absher, K., Jennings, C. D., Howard, D. S., Jordan, C. T., and Gu, L. (2008) Cell Res. in pressGoogle Scholar). Although the vast majority of the cases defective in MMR in the aforementioned study were because of either mutations in key MMR genes MSH2 and MLH1 or epigenetic modifications in the promoter region of MLH1, a patient, as described below, was found to carry a novel mutation that also lead to a mutator phenotype. This patient was diagnosed with AML on August 2005 and received standard chemotherapy (see “Experimental Procedures”). After achieving complete remission, the patient underwent relapse on June 2006. Blood samples collected from the patient at both the initial diagnosis and the relapse were designated as AML0805 and AML0606, respectively (12Mao, G., Yuan, F., Absher, K., Jennings, C. D., Howard, D. S., Jordan, C. T., and Gu, L. (2008) Cell Res. in pressGoogle Scholar). To determine whether the patient was associated with MMR defects, genomic DNA from blood samples of the patient was tested for MSI. Among five standard microsatellite markers examined, polymorphic PCR products were detected in a dinucleotide repeat marker ACTC between the patient's diagnostic and relapsed blood cells (Fig. 1A), indicative of MSI (13Boland C.R. Thibodeau S.N. Hamilton S.R. Sidransky D. Eshleman J.R. Burt R.W. Meltzer S.J. Rodriguez-Bigas M.A. Fodde R. Ranzani G.N. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5248-5257PubMed Google Scholar). Instability was also examined in mononucleotide repeat markers CASPASE-5(A)10 (Fig. 1B) and FANCD2(T)10 (Fig. 1C), where a run of 10 adenines and 10 thymines were present in exon 2 of CASPASE-5 and intron 5 of FANCD2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 (D and E), frameshift mutations of these mononucleotide repeats were observed in the patient's relapsed sample (see MT sequence in Fig. 1, D and E). These observations strong suggest that the relapsed leukemia adopted a hypermutable phenotype during chemotherapy. Identification of a 3-Nucleotide Deletion in the 3′-UTR of MLH1 in the Relapsed Sample of the PatientThe mutator phenotype in the relapsed sample of the leukemia patient prompted us to search for alterations in key MMR genes MSH2 and MLH1 using PCR-based SSCP analysis, followed by DNA sequencing. This analysis did not reveal any mutations in exons and exon-intron junctions of either gene (data not shown). Hypermethylation analysis was also performed, but no such epigenetic modification was detected in the promoter region of MLH1 or MSH2 (data not shown). However, we did observe a deletion mutation in the MLH1 3′-UTR (Fig. 2). Two sets of primers were used to amplify the 3′-UTR and adjacent DNA sequence of MLH1. One primer set amplified exon 19 and the 3′-UTR, and the other set amplified the 3′-UTR and downstream untranscribed DNA sequences (Fig. 2A). Both primer pairs generated one set of PCR products common to AML0805 (diagnostic sample) and AML0606 (relapsed sample), and one set of PCR products unique to AML0606. These bands were designated 1–4 and 1′-3′, as shown in Fig. 2, B and C. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that bands 1–4 corresponded to the wild-type MLH1 3′-UTR sequence (Fig. 2D, left). In contrast, DNA sequencing of bands 1′ and 2′ (products of primers ex19F and ex19R) and 3′ (a product of primers 3′utrF and 3′utrR) revealed the presence of a 3-nucleotide (TTC) deletion in the 3′-UTR of MLH1 in AML0606 (Fig. 2D, center and right). The observation of both wild-type and mutated alleles of the 3′-UTR seems to suggest a heterozygous mutation. However, based on the information from this and previous studies, we believe that the mutation is a homozygous one. First, the DNA used in this experiment was extracted from a heterogeneous population of white blood cells, which was likely to include leukemic and non-leukemic cells. Secondly, previous studies have revealed that individuals with heterozygous defects (e.g. germline mutations in HNPCC or heterozygous knockouts in mice) of an MMR gene generally possess a functional MMR system and do not display MSI (14Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The identification of MSI in the patient relapsed blood sample suggests a complete loss of MMR function in a significant fraction of leukemic cells. Therefore, the detection of both the wild-type and mutant MLH1 3′-UTR is likely caused by the presence of both MMR proficient and deficient cells in the samples analyzed. Functional Effect of the MT 3′-UTR on Reporter Gene Expression and mRNA StabilityTo determine whether the 3-nucleotide deletion in the MLH1 3′-UTR altered expression of upstream coding sequences, the WT or MT MLH1 3′-UTR was cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3A). The reporter gene constructs were transfected into HeLa-S3 cells, and the expression of the luciferase and the stability of the reporter transcript were quantified in transfected cells. The results showed that the reporter construct with the MT 3′-UTR reproducibly produced ∼2-fold lower luciferase activity than the construct with the WT 3′-UTR (Fig. 3B). Quantification of luciferase mRNA by real-time RT-PCR also showed a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.01) in the stability of the firefly luciferase transcript with the MT 3′-UTR. These results clearly indicate that the 3-nucleotide deletion in the MLH1 3′-UTR has significant functional effects on reporter gene expression and stability of transcripts from an upstream reporter gene. Functional Effect of the MT 3′-UTR on MLH1 ExpressionThe effect of the MT MLH1 3′-UTR on expression of an ectopic copy of MLH1 was also examined. For this experiment, the MLH1 gene with WT or MT 3′-UTR was cloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (PCMV) in the vector pcDNA3.1. MLH1 was expressed from this construct with an N-terminal His6 tag (Fig. 4A). The constructs also included the gene encoding neomycin resistance and expressed the corresponding polypeptide, which conferred neomycin resistance to transfected cells. These expression constructs were transiently transfected into human kidney cell line 293T, in which the endogenous MLH1 gene was epigenetically silenced by promoter methylation (15Cejka P. Stojic L. Mojas N. Russell A.M. Heinimann K. Cannavo E. di Pietro M. Marra G. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the expression of ectopic MLH1 was monitored by Western blot. The neomycin resistance protein was used as an internal control. The results show that a much lower level of MLH1 was produced by the expression construct with the MT MLH1 3′-UTR (Fig. 4B). Thus, the 3-nucleotide deletion in the MLH1 3′-UTR reduces expression of either MLH1 or the luciferase reporter gene. These results suggest that the MT 3′-UTR may non-specifically decrease the stability and/or expression of co-linear RNA transcripts in cis. To determine the effect of the MT 3′-UTR on the stability and/or steady-state level of MLH1 mRNA in relapsed leukemia of the patient, mRNAs isolated from the patient's relapsed (AML0606), and diagnostic (AML0805) white blood cells were analyzed for the steady-state level of MLH1 by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), the MLH1 cDNA in AML0606 was at least 33% less abundant than in AML0805. The reduction in mRNA levels in AML0606 is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the impact of the 3′-UTR mutation on MLH1 cDNA expression could be underestimated by these data because the blood sample used for this experiment likely included a heterogenous mixture of cells with different MLH1 genotypes. These observations support a role for the MT 3′-UTR in leukemia relapse in AML0606. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors also contribute to the relapse. This study characterizes the MLH1 genotype in a relapsed leukemia patient, who was previously diagnosed with AML. The results indicate that leukemia relapse was associated with a 3-nucleotide deletion in the 3′-UTR of MLH1 and that the MT MLH1 3′-UTR reduced MLH1 expression in vivo. In particular, the steady-state level of the MT MLH1 transcript in the patient's relapsed blood (AML0606) was much lower than the steady-state level of the WT MLH1 transcript in AML0805 (Fig. 4). This is likely due to the fact that the MT MLH1 3′-UTR destabilizes mRNA transcripts in cis, as shown here by its effects on transcripts from a proximal firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2). This paper reports the novel observation that a 3-nucleotide deletion in the MLH1 3′-UTR reduces MLH1 expression in vivo, which could in turn reduce MMR efficiency. Although there is ample precedent for 3′-UTRs regulating expression of the proximal upstream gene (16Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 17Li X.L. Andersen J.B. Ezelle H.J. Wilson G.M. Hassel B.A. J. Biol.

Pellegrini N. Urtizberea J.A. Guicheney P. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, this is the first report of a functional regulatory role for the 3′-UTR of a human MMR gene. It will be of interest to determine the frequency at which this mutation occurs in leukemia patients treated with or without chemotherapy, in patients with other types of cancer (including HNPCC), and in healthy individuals. Although this study only reports one patient, we actually identified the same mutation in 3 out of 53 AML patients (12Mao, G., Yuan, F., Absher, K., Jennings, C. D., Howard, D. S., Jordan, C. T., and Gu, L. (2008) Cell Res. in pressGoogle Scholar). Because blood samples available from the other two patients were collected during the course of their chemotherapy, it is difficult to perform similar analyses as described for patient AML0606. In addition, we have no clue if the mutation is therapy-induced or pre-existing at the diagnosis. Although these data must be interpreted with caution due to small sample number, they suggest a higher than expected frequency of this mutation in AML patients. Based on the fact that the mutation was detected in relapsed but not diagnostic cells of the AML patient, it is possible that the MT 3′-UTR could play a role in disease relapse. Because the MT MLH1 3′-UTR appears to destabilize the MLH1 transcript in white blood cells from AML0606 (Fig. 4C and D), it is predicted that these cells could be hypomorphic for MLH1 and therefore functionally deficient in MMR. This possibility is consistent with the observation that AML0606 cells are MSI-positive in one of five microsatellite markers tested and contain frameshift mutations in mononucleotide repeat sequences of CASPASE-5 and FANCD2 genes (Fig. 1), both of which have been shown to be important targets for the mutation in MSI-positive cancers (11Offman J. Gascoigne K. Bristow F. Macpherson P. Bignami M. Casorelli I. Leone G. Pagano L. Sica S. Halil O. Cummins D. Banner N.R. Karran P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the MT MLH1 3′-UTR destabilizes proximal RNA transcripts is not known. Previous studies show that cis-acting DNA sequence elements in 3′-UTRs and trans-acting protein factors influence mRNA stability. For example, the AU-rich element is an extensively studied cis-acting element commonly found in eukaryotic 3′-UTRs that binds to a cognate protein, AU-rich element binding protein, and their interaction stimulates mRNA turnover (19Hew Y. Lau C. Grzelczak Z. Keeley F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24857-24864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis shows that the 3′-UTR of MLH1 does not contain any AU-rich element. However, secondary structure analysis (21Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10164) Google Scholar) of the WT and MT 3′-UTR of MLH1 showed that the TTC-deletion identified in this study lies in a large stem-loop structure. The deletion of 3-nucleotide in the region reduced the size of stem-loop and created a new small stem-loop (supplemental Fig. 1). The impact of altering the size of this stem-loop and loop numbers on MLH1 mRNA structure, stability and/or capacity to bind trans-acting protein factors is not known. Recent studies implicate microRNA molecules as important regulators of gene expression, whose effects are often mediated through interactions with 3′-UTRs. It is highly possible that the microRNA structure change caused by the 3′-UTR mutation may allow different microRNAs to bind, which may have a negative effect on the mRNA stability. It is noteworthy that the 3′-UTR mutation seems to have more negative effect on the protein level than the mRNA level (compare results in Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that the mutation has an impact on both the transcription and translation of MLH1. However, the molecular basis by which the 3′-UTR mutation down-regulates MLH1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels remains to be investigated.

Although studies of zebrafish indicate that fibroblast growth factor (Fgf), Hedgehog (Hh), and the T-box transcription factors, No tail (Ntl) and T-box gene 16 (Tbx16), regulate myogenesis, the hierarchy of these factors has not been determined. Recently, another transcriptional cofactor, Smarcd3, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, has been shown to be required for heart muscle formation in mouse. In zebrafish, fgf8 and ntl expression commences during blastula stages, whereas myogenesis, as indicated by myod expression, does not begin until much later during mid-gastrula stages. smarcd3b expression, on the other hand, becomes enriched in the marginal zone just prior to the beginning of myod expression. Overexpression of smarcd3 shifts the onset of myod and myf5 expression earlier, and myod and myf5 expression in adaxial cells, the earliest muscle precursors, requires Smarcd3, indicating that Smarcd3 is the limiting factor that regulates the onset of myogenesis. Smarcd3 physically interacts with Ntl, and Smarcd3 overexpression fails to rescue myod expression in ntl mutants, demonstrating that function of Smarcd3 depends on Ntl activity.

We propose a model in which cooperative activity of Fgf, Ntl, and Smarcd3 is required for the onset of myogenesis, with Smarcd3b serving as the primary regulator of the timing of myogenesis onset. The initial step in muscle formation is induction of myogenesis in a small group of cells that subsequently proliferate and differentiate into various muscle cell types. Numerous factors have been implicated in the initial induction of myogenesis, but the precise hierarchy of the genetic pathway leading to the onset of myogenesis is still incompletely understood. We have studied the early steps in myogenesis using zebrafish, an excellent system to analyze the genetic control of induction and specification of muscle cells (1Ochi H. Westerfield M. Dev. Growth Differ. 2007; 49: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, myod is the earliest muscle-specific gene expressed during myogenesis; its expression first appears in small triangular patches just lateral of the embryonic shield, or organizer, at mid-gastrulation, 70-75% epiboly stages (2Weinberg E.S. Allende M.L. Kelly C.S. Abdelhamid A. Murakami T. Andermann P. Doerre O.G. Grunwald D.J. Riggleman B. Development. 1996; 122: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar). As the embryonic axis forms, myod expressing cells line up adjacent to the notochord and are called adaxial cells that are slow muscle and muscle pioneer precursors (3Hirsinger E. Stellabotte F. Devoto S.H. Westerfield M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) 3The abbreviations used are: Fgffibroblast growth factorHhHedgehogMOmorpholino oligonucleotideNtlNo tailTbx16T-box gene 16. and the T-box transcription factors, No tail (Ntl), and Spadetail (Spt, Tbx16) play important roles in mesoderm formation and subsequent muscle development. In zebrafish, expression of both fgf and tbx genes begins in the blastoderm margin before the beginning of gastrulation (4Reifers F. Bohli H. Walsh E.C. Crossley P.H. Stainier D.Y. Brand M. Development. 1998; 125: 2381-2395PubMed Google Scholar, 5Goering L.M. Hoshijima K. Hug B. Bisgrove B. Kispert A. Grunwald D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9410-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In fgf8 mutant zebrafish embryos (acerebellar, ace), myod expression in axial mesoderm and subsequently in muscle pioneers is interrupted (4Reifers F. Bohli H. Walsh E.C. Crossley P.H. Stainier D.Y. Brand M. Development. 1998; 125: 2381-2395PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Fgf8 signaling in the somite is also required for terminal differentiation of a subset of fast muscle cells in the lateral somite (6Groves J.A. Hammond C.L. Hughes S.M. Development. 2005; 132: 4211-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that Fgf signaling is involved in muscle development from early myogenesis to terminal muscle fiber differentiation. In either ntl or tbx16 (spt) single mutant embryos, myod expression is delayed until segmentation stages (2Weinberg E.S. Allende M.L. Kelly C.S. Abdelhamid A. Murakami T. Andermann P. Doerre O.G. Grunwald D.J. Riggleman B. Development. 1996; 122: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar, 7Amacher S.L. Draper B.W. Summers B.R. Kimmel C.B. Development. 2002; 129: 3311-3323PubMed Google Scholar), and myod expressing cells fail to form in ntl;tbx16 double mutant embryos (7Amacher S.L. Draper B.W. Summers B.R. Kimmel C.B. Development. 2002; 129: 3311-3323PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that Ntl and Tbx16 are together essential for expression of myogenic genes (5Goering L.M. Hoshijima K. Hug B. Bisgrove B. Kispert A. Grunwald D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9410-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Amacher S.L. Draper B.W. Summers B.R. Kimmel C.B. Development. 2002; 129: 3311-3323PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Fgfs and Tbxs regulate each others expression (8Griffin K. Patient R. Holder N. Development. 1995; 121: 2983-2994PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, fgf and tbx genes are well established as essential regulators of myogenesis. However, there is a long delay between blastula stage, when fgf and tbx gene expression begins in the blastoderm margin, and the mid-gastrula stage when muscle precursors first express myod. This gap suggests that additional factors must regulate the most proximal steps in the induction of myogenesis. fibroblast growth factor Hedgehog morpholino oligonucleotide No tail T-box gene 16. Previous studies have implicated Hedgehog (Hh) in zebrafish myogenesis (9Du S.J. Devoto S.H. Westerfield M. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10Wolff C. Roy S. Ingham P.W. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Zebrafish shhb (previously tiggy winkle hh) is expressed in the embryonic shield from the beginning of gastrulation at 50% epiboly, and shha expression starts slightly later at 60% epiboly, just before myod expression begins (11Krauss S. Concordet J.P. Ingham P.W. Cell. 1993; 75: 1431-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Hh might function as the unknown regulator of the onset of myogenesis. Recently, however, we showed that slow muscle precursors form independently of Hh signaling, whereas Hh is essential for commitment of muscle precursor cells to the slow fate (3Hirsinger E. Stellabotte F. Devoto S.H. Westerfield M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that Hh signaling is not required for the initial steps of muscle development. SWI/SNF is a nucleosome remodeling complex that facilitates the function of transcriptional activators by opposing chromatin-dependent repression of transcription (12Martens J.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The vertebrate SWI/SNF complex consists of 7-13 subunits, and it contains one of the two ATPases, Smarca4 (previously BRG1) or Smarca2 (BRM), that are functional homologs of yeast SWI2 (12Martens J.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the SWI/SNF complex interacts with tissue-specific transcription factors that operate during development (13Seo S. Richardson G.A. Kroll K.L. Development. 2005; 132: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Lickert H. Takeuchi J.K. Von Both I. Walls J.R. McAuliffe F. Adamson S.L. Henkelman R.M. Wrana J.L. Rossant J. Bruneau B.G. Nature. 2004; 432: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), suggesting that these transcription factors function in the context of DNA that is assembled into higher-order chromatin structures. During muscle development, Smarca4 promotes MyoD, Mef2D, and Myogenin-mediated muscle differentiation (15de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 16Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Smarcd3 (previously Baf60c) was purified as a component of the human SWI/SNF complex by immunoaffinity purification with an antibody directed against Smarca4 (17Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that Smarcd3 is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (17Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). More recent analysis showed that Smarcd3 regulates heart development by recruiting Smarca4 to Tbx5 (14Lickert H. Takeuchi J.K. Von Both I. Walls J.R. McAuliffe F. Adamson S.L. Henkelman R.M. Wrana J.L. Rossant J. Bruneau B.G. Nature. 2004; 432: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Thus, several chromatin-remodeling factors seem to be essential for the activity of tissue-specific transcription factors in developing muscle, and one or more of them may serve as the proximal regulator of the onset of myogenesis. Consistent with our previous studies, we show that Fgf and Ntl induce myod and myf5 expression independently of Hh activity. To explore how Fgf and Ntl regulate the onset of myod expression, we studied the function of smarca4 and smarcd3 in early myogenesis. We cloned the zebrafish duplicates, smarcd3a and smarcd3b, and find that although smarca4 is ubiquitously expressed throughout gastrulation, smarcd3b mRNA becomes enriched in the marginal zone at mid-gastrula stages when myod expression begins. Later smarcd3b is expressed in the notochord. Functional analysis of Smarcd3b reveals that the onset of myod and myf5 expression can be shifted to earlier developmental stages by precocious expression of Smarcd3b, and induction of myod and myf5 expression disappears in embryos depleted of Smarcd3b by morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) injection. Furthermore, Smarcd3b interacts physically with Ntl and fails to induce myod in ntl mutant embryos, demonstrating that the function of Smarcd3b depends on Ntl. We propose a model in which cooperative activity of Fgf, Ntl, and Smarcd3 leads to the onset of myogenesis in mesoderm, with Smarcd3b serving as the primary regulator of the timing of myogenesis onset. AnimalsEmbryos were obtained from the University of Oregon zebrafish facility, produced using standard procedures (18Westerfield M.

Plasmid ConstructionGene-specific primers to amplify full-length zebrafish smarcd3b and part of smarcd3a cDNA were designed based on the available Ensemble zebrafish genome assembly (Zv4). Zebrafish genome informatics analysis (based on the Zv6 assembly) reveals that smarcd3a lies on chromosome 2 at location 29,590,697-29,535,800 base pairs (bp) and smarcd3b lies on chromosome 7 between 50,094,643 and 50,113,890 bp. Full-length zebrafish smarcd3b were obtained from 8-somite stage embryos and partial zebrafish smarcd3a was obtained from 24 hpf embryos by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The smarcd3b sequence was cloned into the EcoRI site of pCS2 (pCS2-smarcd3b). Zebrafish Smarcd3 sequences were deposited at NCBI (EF552706). In Vitro mRNA SynthesisCapped mRNAs were transcribed from linearized DNA templates with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription kits (mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 or SP6, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. smarcd3b was synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase from the pCS2-smarcd3b plasmid linearized by KpnI. Dominant negative smarca4 was synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase from pCS2-DNxBrg1 (smarca4) plasmid linearized by NotI (13Seo S. Richardson G.A. Kroll K.L.

SU5402 and Cyclopamine TreatmentsSU5402 (25Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) (Calbiochem) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and cyclopamine (26Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) was dissolved in 95% ethanol (EtOH). Embryos in their chorions were treated with 30 μm SU5402 or 100 μm cyclopamine from the 40% epiboly stage to Bud stage or somite stages. Treatments were performed in 12-well plates, 40 embryos per well, in 1 ml of fish water. No effects were observed by exposure to Me2SO or EtOH vehicle alone at the same concentration as used for the experimental treatments. Treated embryos were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and processed for in situ hybridization. In Vitro Translation, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot AnalysisThe PCR product of ntl was cloned into pCS2+MT (pCS-myc-ntl) and pCMV-3Tag (Stratagene) (pCMV-flag-ntl). smarcd3b was cloned into pCMV-3Tag (pCMV-flag-smarcd3b). Proteins were produced by in vitro translation using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). After translation, 20 μl of Myc-Ntl containing lysate was added to 20 μl of FLAG-Smarcd3b containing lysate and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C for binding. Dilution buffer (360 μl of 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with Protease inhibitor and anti-Myc antibody-conjugated beads (Sigma) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were collected and washed four times with dilution buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Induction of Muscle Precursors by Fgf and Ntl Is Independent of Hh ActivityNumerous studies have shown that Fgf signaling, Ntl, Tbx16, and Hh signaling are required for muscle development in zebrafish. hh expression starts just before myod expression, whereas fgf8 and ntl are expressed earlier, prior to gastrulation (Fig. 1A). Recently, we showed that slow muscle precursors, the adaxial cells, form independently of Hh signaling (3Hirsinger E. Stellabotte F. Devoto S.H. Westerfield M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous observations, myod expression in adaxial cells and myf5 expression in paraxial mesoderm are unaffected in embryos treated with the Hh inhibitor, cyclopamine, from 40% epiboly stage to Bud stage (Fig. 1, H-N), whereas myod expression is completely suppressed in embryos treated with cyclopamine from Bud stage to 8 somite stage (Fig. 1N). Thus, Hh activity is required for maintenance rather than induction of myogenic gene expression. In contrast, embryos treated with the Fgf receptor (Fgfr) inhibitor, SU5402, from the 40% epiboly stage to Bud stage lack myod and myf5 expression (Fig. 1, B-G and N). We confirmed that ntl and tbx16 expression disappears in embryos treated with the Fgfr inhibitor, whereas snai1a expression remains in the paraxial mesoderm (data not shown). Thus, Fgf and Hh have distinct roles in the formation of slow muscle precursors. Furthermore, we find myod expression is expanded in embryos overexpressing fgf8 and ntl and the same expanded myod expression is observed in embryos overexpressing fgf8 and ntl that are treated with the Hh inhibitor (Fig. 1, O-T). Thus, Fgf and Ntl induce muscle precursors and this induction is independent of Hh activity. Ubiquitously Expressed Smarca4 Participates in Early MyogenesisThere is a long delay between when fgf and tbx gene expression begins in the blastoderm margin, and when muscle precursors first express myod (Fig. 1A). In addition, simultaneous injection of fgf8 and ntl fails to shift the onset of myogenesis to earlier developmental times (Fig. 4T). Thus, something other than the onset of Fgf8 and Ntl expression must regulate the timing of myod expression. One possibility is that Fgf and Ntl require additional factors to induce myod expression, and such factors may not be expressed until later. To test this hypothesis, we examined candidate factors, Smarca4, containing an ATPase domain that is essential for ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling, and Smarcd3 that is expressed in skeletal muscle in mouse (17Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that Smarcd3 regulates the transcriptional activity of Tbx5, a T-box transcription factor, by recruiting Smarca4 to Tbx5 (14Lickert H. Takeuchi J.K. Von Both I. Walls J.R. McAuliffe F. Adamson S.L. Henkelman R.M. Wrana J.L. Rossant J. Bruneau B.G. Nature. 2004; 432: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Thus, Smarca4 and Smarcd3 are good candidates for regulating myogenesis. To learn whether Smarca4 may be the factor that controls the onset of myod expression, we examined the expression of smarca4 and whether Smarca4 regulates myod expression. Dominant negative Smarca4 slightly reduces myod expression (Fig. 2, E-H). Because smarca4 is ubiquitously distributed throughout the embryo during gastrula stages (Fig. 2, A-D) and is known to regulate several other developmental processes, such as neurogenesis (13Seo S. Richardson G.A. Kroll K.L. Development. 2005; 132: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it is an unlikely candidate for specific regulation of myogenesis onset. So, we then identified and cloned two zebrafish smarcd3 genes (supplemental Fig. S1). smarcd3b Expression Is Enriched in Mesodermal Cells Just Before myod Expression BeginsZebrafish smarcd3b transcripts are maternally supplied and ubiquitously distributed until the 50% epiboly stage (data not shown). Later, smarcd3b expression becomes enriched in mesodermal cells (Fig. 2I, arrows). As development proceeds, smarcd3b transcripts appear in the tail bud region (Fig. 2, J and K) and in the notochord (Fig. 2M). Transcripts from smarcd3a, the duplicate gene, are also supplied maternally. However, unlike smarcd3b, smarcd3a transcripts are ubiquitously distributed until segmentation stages, and then only later, are restricted to somites (data not shown). Thus, Smarcd3b is a good candidate to act together with Ntl as a regulator of myogenesis. Double labeling for smarcd3b and ntl expression indicates that they are co-expressed in the marginal zone during late gastrula stages and in the notochord during segmentation stages (Fig. 2, I-M). We also find that cells co-express smarcd3b, ntl, and myod by the 75% epiboly stage (Fig. 2, N-Q, arrows). Together, these results indicate that zebrafish smarcd3b is expressed with ntl in muscle precursor cells. Because Fgf signaling regulates both ntl expression and myogenesis (8Griffin K. Patient R. Holder N. Development. 1995; 121: 2983-2994PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that Fgf signaling also regulates mesodermal expression of smarcd3b. We find that mesodermal expression of smarcd3b requires Fgf signaling (Fig. 3, A-H). Smarcd3b Depletion Suppresses Early MyogenesisTo learn whether Smarcd3b is required for the onset of myogenesis, we examined myod and myf5 expression in embryos injected with splice blocking MO. We confirmed that injection of MO results in the production of aberrantly spliced smarcd3b transcripts (supplemental Fig. S2). Although myod expression is apparent by the 75% epiboly stage in control embryos, we do not observe myod expression in smarcd3b-MO-injected embryos (Fig. 4, A and B), and myod expression is still missing at Bud stage (Fig. 4, C and D). myf5 expression is also blocked in smarcd3b-MO injected embryos (Fig. 4, E and F, bracket). In contrast, ntl, shha, tbx16, and snai1a are expressed normally in smarcd3b-MO injected embryos (Fig. 4, G-L, data not shown), suggesting that Smarcd3b function is not required for formation of the notochord and paraxial mesoderm. Although smarcd3b-MO suppresses early myogenesis, muscle formation eventually recovers (supplemental Table S1), suggesting that some other Smarcd, such as Smarcd3a expressed in somites, may provide later support for myogenesis. Thus, Smarcd3b regulates the initial onset of myogenesis. Overexpression of Smarcd3b Shifts the Onset of myod and myf5 Expression to Earlier Developmental TimesWe tested whether Smarcd3b regulates the timing of myod and myf5 expression. The onset of myod and myf5 expression normally occurs at the 70-75% epiboly stage, and myod and myf5 expression is undetectable earlier at the 50% epiboly stage (Fig. 4, M and T). In contrast to fgf8 and ntl injection (Fig. 4, N, O, and T), smarcd3b significantly increases myod expression in the dorsal blastoderm margin (Fig. 4, P and T), where the endogenous fgf8 and ntl transcripts are present. We find that myod expression can be induced by Smarcd3b as early as the 30% epiboly stage (Fig. 4, S and T). Parasagittal sections reveal that the myod expression induced by Smarcd3b is restricted to the mesendodermal layer (Fig. 4Q). Although smarcd3b mRNA slightly increases the number of muscle pioneers, there are no apparent differences in the number of slow muscle cells (supplemental Table S1). These results indicate that Smarcd3b is the limiting factor that regulates the onset of myod expression and that expressing Smarcd3 earlier than normal leads to precocious induction of myod and myf5 expression in the mesendoderm. Function of Smarcd3b Depends on NtlTo analyze the position of Smarcd3 within the genetic pathway that regulates muscle development, we examined whether Smarcd3b can induce myod expression in ntl and fgf8 mutants or in embryos with disrupted Hh signaling. As previously reported, myod expression is absent at Bud stage in ntl mutants (Fig. 5C) (2Weinberg E.S. Allende M.L. Kelly C.S. Abdelhamid A. Murakami T. Andermann P. Doerre O.G. Grunwald D.J. Riggleman B. Development. 1996; 122: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar) and we do not detect myod expression in smarcd3b-injected ntl mutants (Fig. 5, A-D). In addition, injection of smarcd3b mRNA fails to induce myod in fgf8 mutant embryos (Fig. 5, E and F). These results indicate that function of Smarcd3b depends on Ntl and Fgf activity. In contrast, injection of smarcd3b mRNA shifts myod expression earlier in cyclopamine-treated embryos (Fig. 5H), as in wild-type embryos (Fig. 5G), indicating that Hh activity is not required for the function of Smarcd3b. Our observation that Smarcd3b depends on Ntl activity, together with previous work indicating that mouse Smarcd3 recruits Smarca4 to Tbx5 (14Lickert H. Takeuchi J.K. Von Both I. Walls J.R. McAuliffe F. Adamson S.L. Henkelman R.M. Wrana J.L. Rossant J. Bruneau B.G. Nature. 2004; 432: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), suggests that Smarcd3b may interact, either directly or indirectly, with Ntl. Proteins were produced by in vitro translation using the reticulocyte lysate. We find that FLAG-tagged Smarcd3b co-immunoprecipitates with myc-tagged Ntl (Fig. 5I), indicating that zebrafish Smarcd3b interacts with Ntl. We also find that Ntl binds to Smarca4. However, we could not observe that Smarcd3b enhances this interaction (Fig. 5J). We also confirmed that Ntl directly binds to the 1/2 T-site of the myod promoter (Fig. 5K) (27Yang H.W. Kutok J.L. Lee N.H. Piao H.Y. Fletcher C.D. Kanki J.P. Look A.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7256-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that Fgf, Ntl, Smarcd3b, and Smarca4 act together to regulate the onset of myogenesis in zebrafish. The Time Lag between the Onset of fgf and ntl Expression and the Onset of myod and myf5 Expression Indicates Missing Factors That Regulate MyogenesisPrecise timing of induction, specification, and differentiation of particular cell types is critical for organogenesis. Sequential activation and repression of genes is a common mechanism used to regulate developmental timing. During zebrafish myogenesis, myod and myf5 are initially expressed by cells adjacent to the notochord (2Weinberg E.S. Allende M.L. Kelly C.S. Abdelhamid A. Murakami T. Andermann P. Doerre O.G. Grunwald D.J. Riggleman B. Development. 1996; 122: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar). Signal transduction pathways, such as Fgf and Hh, and the transcription factor Ntl are known to regulate myod and myf5 expression during skeletal muscle development. Because these molecules participate in numerous other aspects of development, however, their specific roles in the induction of muscle cells are still unclear. We demonstrate that Fgf and Ntl regulate the formation of slow muscle precursors independently of Hh activity. However, there is a long delay between blastula stages, when fgf and tbx gene expression begins in the blastoderm margin, and late gastrula stages when muscle precursors first express myod. This gap suggested that additional factors control the timing of the onset of myogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Smarcd3 proteins fulfill this role. Smarcd3b expression appears in the marginal region just prior to the onset of myogenesis, Smacd3b is necessary for the onset of myogenesis and expressing Smarcd3b in the marginal zone at earlier developmental stages concomitantly shifts myogenesis earlier. Hh Signaling in Muscle DevelopmentIn zebrafish, hh gene expression begins just before the onset of myod expression, and overexpression of shha mRNA is sufficient to induce myod expression in paraxial mesoderm (2Weinberg E.S. Allende M.L. Kelly C.S. Abdelhamid A. Murakami T. Andermann P. Doerre O.G. Grunwald D.J. Riggleman B. Development. 1996; 122: 271-280PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the Myf5 epaxial somite enhancer is Shh-dependent and directly regulated by Gli in mouse (28Gustafsson M.K. Pan H. Pinney D.F. Liu Y. Lewandowski A. Epstein D.J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Teboul L. Summerbell D. Rigby P.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2870-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, Hh signaling has been considered to be a good candidate for regulating the induction of myogenesis (30Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 747-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). On the other hand, however, we previously showed that slow muscle precursors form independently of Hh signaling (3Hirsinger E. Stellabotte F. Devoto S.H. Westerfield M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and our results presented here further demonstrate that Hh is not involved in the initial induction of myod expression. Instead, we find that Hh signaling is required for maintenance of myod expression after muscle precursor cells converge toward the midline and join the adaxial cell layer next to the notochord. Consistent with this interpretation, analysis of sonic you (shha) mutants revealed defects in maintenance of myf5 and myod expression and in timely terminal differentiation of muscle cells in zebrafish (31Coutelle O. Blagden C.S. Hampson R. Halai C. Rigby P.W. Hughes S.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); and, in mouse, Shh is required for Myf5-dependent epaxial muscle determination (32Borycki A.G. Brunk B. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Chiang C. Emerson Jr., C.P. Development. 1999; 126: 4053-4063PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Hh signaling functions primarily in specification and differentiation of muscle cells rather than in induction of myogenesis. The Chromatin-remodeling Factor, Smarcd3, and Ntl Cooperatively Regulate the Onset of MyogenesisGenes are packaged into chromatin structures that can modulate transcriptional activation and repression. The SWI/SNF complex facilitates the functions of transcriptional activators by altering chromatin structure (33Sudarsanam P. Winston F. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). During myogenesis in mammals, Smarca4, a SWI/SNF component, is required for MyoD, Mef2D, and Myogenin-mediated muscle differentiation (15de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 16Ohkawa Y. Marfella C.G. Imbalzano A.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, Smarca4 also regulates retinal and neural crest development in zebrafish (34Gregg R.G. Willer G.B. Fadool J.M. Dowling J.E. Link B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6535-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Eroglu B. Wang G. Tu N. Sun X. Mivechi N.F. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2722-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), neurogenesis in Xenopus (13Seo S. Richardson G.A. Kroll K.L. Development. 2005; 132: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and surface ectoderm and fetal epidermal keratinocyte formation in mouse (36Indra A.K. Dupe V. Bornert J.M. Messaddeq N. Yaniv M. Mark M. Chambon P. Metzger D. Development. 2005; 132: 4533-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, Smarca4 functions not only in muscle development but also in numerous other developmental processes. Most chromatin remodeling factors control expression of large numbers of genes and are typically expressed ubiquitously, although Smarcd2 is strongly expressed in pancreas and Smarcd3 is specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle of mouse (17Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Hence, Smarcd2 and Smarcd3 are unusual; their restricted expression patterns suggest that some chromatin remodeling factors may act in a tissue-specific or target-specific manner. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that knockdown of Smarcd3b activity reduces myod and myf5 expression without affecting expression of other well known markers of paraxial mesoderm or notochord (Fig. 4). Thus, Smarcd3b controls the expression of a restricted subset of genes in a restricted set of tissues. Vertebrate SWI/SNF complexes contain one of the two ATPases, Smarca2 (BRM) or Smarca4 (BRG1), plus a variable subset of the Brg-associated factors, including Smarcd. Together, these results indicate that various combinations of Brg-associated factors may provide the specificity of action required to regulate the subsets of genes required for development of different cell types, tissues, and organs. We envisage a mechanism that can explain how Fgf and Ntl regulate the onset of myogenesis (Fig. 5L). During the late blastula period, Fgf and Ntl in the marginal zone promote mesoderm formation (37Griffin K.J. Kimelman D. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Draper B.W. Stock D.W. Kimmel C.B. Development. 2003; 130: 4639-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). smaca4 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the embryo during blastula and gastrula stages. Smacd3b enhances the interaction between Smaca4 and tissue-specific transcription factors, whereas the Smacad3 protein fails to interact directly with Smaca4 (14Lickert H. Takeuchi J.K. Von Both I. Walls J.R. McAuliffe F. Adamson S.L. Henkelman R.M. Wrana J.L. Rossant J. Bruneau B.G. Nature. 2004; 432: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). By midgastrula stage, Smarcd3b accumulates in the marginal zone and, together with Ntl and Smaca4, activates myod and myf5 transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2077365027,"We have described an autoantibody against β3 (GPIIIa49–66), a region of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 that is unique. It induces platelet fragmentation in the absence of complement via antibody activation of platelet NADPH oxidase and 12-lipoxygenase to release reactive oxygen species, which destroy platelets. To study the mechanism of anti-GPIIIa antibody-induced platelet fragmentation, we screened a human single chain Fv antibody library with the GPIIIa49–66 peptide. Nine monoclonal antibodies were identified that were capable of binding to GPIIIa49–66. Surprisingly, binding avidity for GPIIIa49–66 did not correlate with activity of induction of platelet fragmentation. We therefore investigated the requirements for platelet fragmentation. Mutations were introduced into the heavy chain complementary-determining region-3 of clones 11, 43, and 54 by site-directed mutagenesis. The capability of these clones to induce platelet fragmentation or bind to GPIIIa49–66 subsequently changed. Molecular modeling of these clones with their mutants revealed that the ability to induce platelet fragmentation is affected by the side chain orientation of positively charged amino acids in the heavy chain of residues 99–102. Thus, a structural change in the conformation of anti-GPIIIa49–66 antibody contributes to its binding to the β3 integrin and subsequent antibody-induced platelet fragmentation and aggregate dissolution.

The extracellular domain of the β3 integrin subunit consists of a head and stalk region (6Bennett J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3363-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The head includes a βA domain with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif and one hybrid domain. The stalk consists of a PSI (plexin/sema-phorin/integrin) domain, four tandem epidermal growth factor repeats, and a β tail domain (7Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Although the function of the PSI domain is incompletely understood, a PlA2 polymorphism of the β3 integrin (Leu-33 to Pro-33) has been linked to this region, which leads to an increased risk of thrombotic events (8Undas A. Brummel K. Musial J. Mann K.G. Szczeklik A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Szczeklik A. Undas A. Sanak M. Frolow M. Wegrzyn W. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the PlA2 allele is associated with greater affinity of the αIIbβ3 integrin for fibrinogen (10Andrioli G. Minuz P. Solero P. Pincelli S. Ortolani R. Lussignoli S. Bellavite P. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Michelson A.D. Furman M.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Mascelli M.A. Hendrix C. Coleman L. Hamlington J. Barnard M.R. Kickler T. Christie D.J. Kundu S. Bray P.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, the PlA2 polymorphism can result in a severe form of alloimmune thrombocytopenia (12Davoren A. Curtis B.R. Aster R.H. McFarland J.G. Transfusion (Bethesda). 2004; 44: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Winters J.L. Jennings C.D. Desai N.S. Dickson L.G. Ford R.F. Vox Sang. 1998; 74: 256-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the PSI domain can be considered as a domain with strong immunogenicity as well as the potential to regulate the binding of αIIbβ3 integrin to fibrinogen. We have reported previously that the anti-platelet autoantibody developed in HIV-1-ITP patients is immunodominant against GPIIIa49–66 (a region that crosses the PSI and hybrid domains) (3Nardi M. Tomlinson S. Greco M.A. Karpatkin S. Cell. 2001; 106: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Li Z. Nardi M.A. Karpatkin S.

Investig. 2004; 113: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how antibody interacts with this region between the PSI and hybrid domains to induce the downstream signaling and oxidative platelet fragmentation. To investigate the detailed mechanism of antibody-induced binding and fragmentation, monoclonal antibody is required because some polyclonal antibodies often have cross-reactivity with other antigens. However, attempts at raising monoclonal antibody against human GPIIIa49–66 in mice were unsuccessful. This is likely due to homology sequences shared with human GPIIIa49–66 leading to mouse immune tolerance. We therefore switched to the phage surface display antibody technology system. Phage surface display antibody technology has been successfully employed to generate antibody that specifically blocks the activated form of αIIbβ3 integrin (14Schwarz M. Rottgen P. Takada Y. Le Gall F. Knackmuss S. Bassler N. Buttner C. Little M. Bode C. Peter K. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1704-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and to investigate the anti-αIIbβ3 autoantibody profile from patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura or Glanzmann thrombasthenia after receiving blood transfusions (15Jacobin M.J.

In the present study, we have employed human scFv (single chain fragment of the variable region) Tomlinson I + J libraries to generate human anti-GPIIIa49–66 monoclonal antibody. Each library contains over 100 million different scFv fragments cloned in the phagemid vector pIT2. The library sizes of I and J are 1.47 × 108 and 1.37 × 108 constructs, respectively (16Clackson T. Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Nature. 1991; 352: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 17Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R. Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Midgley C. Lane D. Winter G.

Both libraries are based on a single human framework for VH (V3–23/DP-47 and JH4b) and Vκ (O12/O2/DPK9 and Jκ1) with side chain diversity incorporated at positions in the antigen-binding site that make contacts to antigen in known structures and are highly diverse in the mature repertoire. Thus, these libraries can be used to screen antibodies against virtually any given antigen. Therefore, we used these libraries to better understand the mechanism of antibody-induced oxidative platelet fragmentation with respect to interaction with the PSI and hybrid domains of the β3 integrin subunit. In the present study, we show that 1) eight scFv monoclonal antibodies induce platelet fragmentation; 2) there is no correlation between binding activity and ability to induce platelet fragmentation; 3) the presence and position of positively charged amino acids in the complementary-determining region-3 (CDR3) of the heavy chain can affect platelet fragmentation as well as binding; 4) these scFv monoclonal antibodies are capable of destroying platelet aggregates; and 5) one of the scFv antibodies tested decreases the platelet count and prolongs the bleeding time in mice. These results strongly suggest that a specific structural conformation is required for antibody-induced platelet fragmentation and that appropriate scFv antibodies might be useful clinically in the dissolution of platelet thrombi. MaterialsAll reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise designated. Human scFv Tomlinson I + J libraries were kindly provided by MRC Geneservice (Cambridge, UK). Screening of the Phage Display Peptide LibraryGPIIIa49–66-biotin peptide (130 nm) was incubated with 1012–1013 phage from the Tomlinson I or J library in 2% nonfat milk in PBS at room temperature for 3 h. Avidin-agarose beads were then added overnight at 4 °C, centrifuged, and washed with 0.1% Tween 20 and PBS 20 times, and positive phages were eluted with trypsin/PBS by shaking for 10 min at room temperature. Eluted phages were then titered and amplified following the protocol provided by MRC Geneservice for the next round of panning. After three rounds of panning, positive phage clones were randomly picked up from the plate. ELISAsPlastic microtiter plates (Corning) were coated with 1 μg/well GPIIIa49–66 at 4 °C overnight. The plate was then blocked and washed with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl) and 2% nonfat milk. Our stock concentration of scFv was standardized to 5 × 1012 phage/ml or 12.4 μg/ml, which is 8.3 nm. 100 μl of serially diluted (1:10 initial dilution, 1:2/step) human scFv antibody was then added to the microtiter plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were washed in the same buffer. The dilution of the second antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (GE Healthcare, 27-9421-01), was 1:500. Induction of Platelet Particle FormationGel-filtered human platelets were prepared from platelet-rich plasma obtained from blood collected in 0.38% sodium citrate utilizing a Sepharose 2B column preincubated with Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4). 1 × 107 gel-filtered platelets/ml were labeled with either anti-GPIIb-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody (3B2) or anti-GPIIIa-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody (Ancell, Bayport, MN) to 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 6 min at room temperature, and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer. 10 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled platelets (107/ml) were then incubated with human scFv anti-GPIIIa49–66 antibody (5–40 μg/ml) and 75 μl of Tyrode's buffer for 0–4 h at 37 °C and stored in an ice bucket prior to measurement of the percentage of platelet particles by flow cytometry. Further particle formation was arrested at 0 °C. Fluorescently labeled platelet particles were measured by flow cytometry, employing a FACScan (BD Biosciences) as reported previously (3Nardi M. Tomlinson S. Greco M.A. Karpatkin S. Cell. 2001; 106: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Debris and dead cells were excluded using scatter gates. Only cells with low orthogonal light scattering were included in the sorting gates. Gates were adjusted for control platelets by exclusion of other blood cells. Fluorescently labeled intact platelets were monitored in the right upper quadrant with the y axis measuring forward scatter and the x axis measuring fluorescence. A shift in fluorescent particles from the right upper quadrant to the left upper and lower quadrants reflected the percentage of platelet particle induction of 10,000 counted platelets/particles. Destruction of Platelet-Fibrinogen Aggregates in Vitro1 × 107 platelets were incubated with 100 mg/ml fibrinogen and 10 μm ADP for 30 min with shaking at 37° to create platelet aggregates. Excess reagents were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min. The platelet aggregates were then resuspended in PBS on a counting chamber, and the number of platelets/aggregate was counted. Anti-GPIIIa49–66 antibody was then added for various time intervals, and the remaining number of platelets/aggregate was enumerated. Bleeding TimeThe mouse tail vein was severed 2 mm from its tip and blotted every 30 s on a circular sheet of filter paper to obtain an objective measurement. The variation of the bleeding time was recorded after absence of blood on the filter paper. Bleeding time differences were recorded by an unbiased observer and confirmed by two other observers. Site-directed MutagenesisTwo mutation primers (forward and backward) targeted for amino acids at positions 99 and 101 were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. The 5′ and 3′ fragments of mutant heavy chain cDNA were amplified using the mutant primers. The full-length mutant heavy chain cDNA fragment was assembled by splicing overlap extension PCR. The mutant heavy chain cDNA was then cloned into the pIT2 expression phage vector between the restriction enzyme cutting sites of SfiI and XhoI. Molecular ModelingThe heavy and light chain amino acid sequences of clones 11, 43, and 54 and their mutants were used to generate the molecular model through WAM-Web antibody modeling. The side chains of amino acids at positions 99 and 101 in the heavy chain have been labeled with different colors using Rasmol software. Generation of Human scFv Anti-GPIIIa49–66 Monoclonal AntibodiesTomlinson I + J libraries were used to screen against a biotin-conjugated GPIIIa49–66 peptide. After each round of screening, binding activities of phage clones were examined by ELISA (Fig. 1A). After a second round of panning, positive phage clones from library J were enriched. Because the binding activities of phage clones from library I were not increased after three rounds of panning, we focused on phage clones from library J. After three rounds of panning, scFv clones were randomly chosen from the bacterial plate, and individual scFv antibodies were made from each clone. The binding activity for GPIIIa49–66 was examined by ELISA (Fig. 1B). All nine clones were found to bind to GPIIIa49–66 with varying activity, with the absorbance reading varying from 3 to 40 times background (Fig. 1B). Two clones tested did not bind to β3-/- intact mouse platelets, indicating specificity of binding to intact β3 platelets (data not shown). Effect of scFv Antibodies on Platelet Fragmentation and Destruction of Platelet AggregatesWe then tested the ability of each clone to induce platelet fragmentation. We found that not all clones induced platelet fragmentation (Fig. 2A) and that the binding activity (Fig. 1B) did not correlate with platelet fragmentation. This suggested that a specific conformation induced by the antibody is more important than the avidity of binding. For example, clone 43 bound to GPIIIa49–66 (Fig. 1B) but did not induce platelet fragmentation. In contrast, clone 54 had weak binding to GPIIIa49–66 but induced significant platelet fragmentation (Fig. 2A). We confirmed the findings with clones 43 and 54 by measuring the binding and ability to induce platelet fragmentation against a standard curve created with clone 11, a potent binding and functional antibody. Fig. 1C demonstrates similar binding for clones 43 and 54, which is about 6-fold less potent compared with clone 11. Fig. 2B demonstrates similar platelet fragmentation function for clones 11 and 54, which is about 24-fold compared with clone 43. We also tested the functional ability of clones 37, 41, 49, and 54 to disaggregate/destroy ADP-induced in vitro platelet aggregates. All clones tested destroyed platelet aggregates in the same manner as antibody from an HIV-1 patient (Fig. 2C). We also tested the ability of the absent functional fragmentation clone 43 to inhibit strong functional fragmentation clones 54 and 11. As noted in Fig. 2D, clone 43 inhibited fragmentation induced by clones 54 and 11, whereas no such inhibition was noted with irrelevant clone CG2. One functional clone tested, clone 11, increased the in vivo bleeding time 3-fold (n = 11; p = 0.001 compared with 43) (Fig. 2E) and decreased the platelet count by ∼30% from 1.096 ± 0.039 to 0.740 ± 0.020 million/μl; p < 0.003. Sequence Analysis of the Heavy and Light Chains of Antibody ClonesNine clones had sequences for both heavy and light chains. The alignment of sequences is shown in Fig. 3. All clones shared the same framework. The CDR2 and CDR3 of both heavy and light chains are shown. Differences in the sequences were found in the HCDR-2 (positions 50, 52–54, 56–57, and 59), HCDR-3 (positions 99–102), LCDR-2 (positions 50 and 53), and LCDR-3 (positions 91–94 and 96) regions. Many positively charged amino acids (Arg, Lys, and His) were found in both the HCDRs and LCDRs. Specific conserved amino acids were not found in all functional clones. Of interest was the observation that only clone 43 had Arg at both positions 101 and 102 in HCDR3. Function of Mutants of Clones 11, 43, and 54A series of mutant clones was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of positively charged amino acids. The amino acids in HCDR3 of clones 11 (Lys-100, Ser-101), 43 (Tyr-99, Arg-101), and 54 (Arg-99, Ser-101) were exchanged to generate mutants 11M1, 43M, and 54M (Fig. 4A). In clone 11, Lys-100 and Ser-101 were mutated to Ser-100 and Lys-101 to generate mutant 11M1. Lys-100 and His-102 were mutated to Gly to generate mutant 11M2 (Fig. 4A). In clone 43, Tyr-99 and Arg-101 were mutated to Arg-99 and Tyr-101 to generate mutant 43M. In clone 54, Arg-99 and Ser-101 were mutated to Ser-99 and Arg-101 to generate mutant 54M. The binding activities of mutants 11M1, 11M2, 43M, and 54M were then examined by ELISA (Fig. 4B). The binding activity of clones 11M2 and 43M decreased compared with their wild-type sequences, whereas 54M increased and 11M1 remained the same compared with their wild-type sequences. In addition, 43M gained the ability to induce platelet fragmentation, whereas 11M1, 11M2, and 54M decreased their platelet fragmentation function (Fig. 4C). Of particular note was 11M2, which still had some binding activity as well as function without Lys-100 and His-102 of HCDR3. These data suggest that a specific conformation is required and that the positively charged amino acids in HCDR3 may affect antibody function. Molecular ModelingTo examine the structural differences between the wild-type and mutant clones, molecular models of clones 11, 43, and 54 and their mutant clones were generated by computer programs WAM and Rasmol (Fig. 5). According to the molecular models, although clones 43M and 54M have different side chain orientations of Arg compared with their wild-type sequences, we found that 43M has similar Arg side chain orientation to 54. 54M has similar Arg side chain orientation to 43. When correlated with the functional assay of clones 43, 54, 43M, and 54M, these observations suggest that a specific conformation is required for inducing platelet fragmentation. In contrast, comparing clone 11 with clones 43 and 54, we have not found significant differences in the side chain orientation of Lys-100 and His-102 in clone 11 with Lys-101 and His-102 in clone 11M1. This is consistent with the fact that there is no significant difference in function between 11 and 11M1. αIIbβ3 integrin function has been intensively studied (6Bennett J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3363-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although there is still disagreement as to how the αIIbβ3 integrin transforms from a low affinity to a high affinity state, it is generally accepted that the αIIbβ3 integrin transmits conformational changes bidirectionally: inside-out and outside-in signaling (19Shattil S.J. Newman P.J. Blood. 2004; 104: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Clustering of the αIIbβ3 integrin subunit is required for outside-in signal transmission. It has been proposed that during the conformational change of αIIbβ3 integrin, the reorganization of hydrogen bonds in the interface between the α7 helix of the βA domain allows the hybrid domain and the rigidly connected PSI domain to swing out. This results in a 70-Å separation of the αIIb and β3 stalks at their “knees,” a feature noted in electron microscopic images of active forms of αIIbβ3 integrin in the presence or absence of ligand (7Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that our antibody may induce the PSI domain to swing out and cluster the β3 subunit. This is supported by our recent discovery that a biotin-labeled peptide capable of binding to GPIIIa49–66 requires anti-biotin antibody-induced clustering to induce oxidative platelet fragmentation. 4Z. Li, M. A. Nardi, R. Pan, W. Zhang, and S. Karpatkin, unpublished data. How such a movement leads to activation of 12-lipoxygenase and NADPH oxidase in platelets is still not clear. In the present study, we have clearly shown that nine monoclonal antibodies against GPIIIa49–66 can be generated by panning with Tomlinson I + J scFv libraries. It is unlikely that these antibodies target other molecules on the platelet surface, as could be the case with polyclonal antibody. Further specificity of our scFv monoclonal antibody was demonstrated by its inability to react with β3-/- mouse platelets. Of great interest was the observation that binding avidity for the GPIIIa49–66 peptide did not correlate with the ability to induce platelet fragmentation. Clone 43 does not induce platelet fragmentation despite its avid binding to the GPIIIa49–66 peptide, whereas the other eight clones induce fragmentation. It is likely that the 43 binding conformation is different compared with the antibodies that induce fragmentation. Those antibodies that induce platelet fragmentation are indeed doing this through the β3 integrin because they fail to induce platelet fragmentation with platelets from β3-/- mice. Clones 11 and 43 bind to wild-type mouse platelets by flow cytometry in a similar manner as patient antibody (data not shown). In addition, mutation analysis of clones 11, 43, and 54 shows that changing the positions of positively charged amino acids in the HCDR3 region alters the function of antibody-induced platelet fragmentation, suggesting that the positively charged amino acid side chain orientation may affect antibody-induced platelet fragmentation. GPIIIa49–66 (CAPESIEFPVSEARVLED) contains five negatively charged amino acids, four glutamic and one aspartic acid. It is therefore not surprising that there are many positively charged amino acids (Arg, Lys, and His) in the CDRs of both heavy and light chains of our antibodies. Compared with other anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies, our antibodies do not contain RGD sequences; therefore, it is unlikely that our antibodies can cross-react with the RGD binding site of αIIbβ3 integrin (20Jacobin M.J. Robert R. Pouns O. Laroche-Traineau J. Nurden A. Peter K. Little M. Clofent-Sanchez G. Clin. Immunol (Orlando). 2003; 108: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that the positively charged amino acids in the HCDR3 play a role in inducing platelet fragmentation, this result does not exclude the possible role(s) of other CDRs in heavy and light chains. In fact, after we mutated both positively charged amino acids in 11 HCDR3, 11M2 still retained some platelet fragmentation capability, suggesting that other regions also contribute to induce platelet fragmentation. Nevertheless, our data establish the concept that a specific conformation with β3 is required for antibody-induced platelet fragmentation. The αIIbβ3 integrin has been utilized as a therapeutic target for thrombosis and occlusion due to coronary artery stenting (21Bhatt D.L. Topol E.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 22Sanz L. Kristensen P. Blanco B. Facteau S. Russell S.J. Winter G. Alvarez-Vallina L. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Side effects of these drugs are thrombocytopenia and bleeding. Development of a different approach to inhibit arterial platelet thrombi by disaggregation/lysis of platelet thrombi with the specific scFv anti-GPIIIa49–66 antibody may be of clinical value.

Ligand residues involved in type II binding are located predominantly in the C-terminal region that forms an extended β-sheet, whereas residues involved in type I binding are located in the α-helical and preceding loop central portion of the molecule. To test whether the central residues are sufficient to determine specificity toward type I receptors, activin A/BMP chimeras were constructed in which the central residues (45–79) of activin A were replaced with corresponding residues of BMP2 and BMP7. The chimeras were assessed for activin type II receptor (Act RII) binding, activin-like bioactivity, and BMP-like activity as well as antagonistic properties toward activin A and myostatin. ActA/BMP7 chimera retained Act RII binding affinity comparable with wild type activin A, whereas ActA/BMP2 chimera showed a slightly reduced affinity toward Act RII. Both the chimeras were devoid of significant activin bioactivity in 293T cells in the A3 Lux reporter assay up to concentrations 10-fold higher than the minimal effective activin A concentration (∼4 nm). In contrast, these chimeras showed BMP-like activity in a BRE-Luc assay in HepG2 cells as well as induced osteoblast-like phenotype in C2C12 cells expressing alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, both the chimeras activated Smad1 but not Smad2 in C2C12 cells. Also, both the chimeras antagonized ligands that signal via activin type II receptor, such as activin A and myostatin.

The ligands of TGF-β family share a distinct structural signature known as the “cysteine knot scaffold” (8Vitt U.A. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Activins adopt this prototypical disulfide-linked dimeric structure and contain two subunits termed β-chains. Genes encoding four different β subunits, βA, βB, βC, and βE, have been identified in the human, theoretically offering a possibility of an array of activin dimers, although only activin A (βA-βA), activin-B (βB-βB), and activin AB (βA-βB) have been documented to be biologically active (9Phillips D.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In each monomer two pairs of antiparallel β-strands stretch out from the cysteine core of the dimer to form short and long fingers. The characteristic curvature of these fingers creates concave and convex surfaces on the ligand. At the base of the fingers, each monomer has an α-helix, which together with the pre-helix loop and the inner concave surface of the fingers of the other monomer form the “wrist” region (10Greenwald J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) were first identified as molecules that induce bone and cartilage formation in rodents (12Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). BMPs are a large family (more than 20 members) with extremely complex and diverse roles both in development and adult life (12Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W.

For example, BMP7 has a role in kidney morphogenesis and bone formation during development and is involved in regulating gonadal function in the adult (15Luo G. Hofmann C. Bronckers A.L. Sohocki M.

BMPs, like activins, signal via type II and type I receptors (19Nohe A. Hassel S. Ehrlich M. Neubauer F. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. J. Biol.

Although BMP type I receptors (ALK3, ALK6, and ALK2) are largely specific for BMP family, it is not true for type II receptors. BMP RII binds only BMPs (21Kawabata M. Chytil A. Moses H.L. J. Biol.

Smith J.C. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The receptor activation mechanism for activin involves initial binding to its type II receptor (Act RII or IIB), which leads to the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of its type I receptor (ALK4) followed by activation of intracellular signaling molecules, Smad2 and -3 (25Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lebrun J.J. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

The specific amino acid residues of activin A involved in the underlying intermolecular interactions within the activin/Act RII-ECD/ALK4-ECD complex can be deduced now based on relevant structural and functional data. The activin A/Act RIIB interface involves hydrophobic (Ile-30, Ala-31, Pro-32, Pro-88, Leu-92, Tyr-94, and Ile-100) and ionic/polar (Arg-87, Ser-90, Lys-102, Glu-111) residues on activin A and overlaps the interface determined in the BMP7/Act RII structure (11Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The activin A/ALK4 interface is not very well characterized. Based on the crystal structure of BMP2 in complex with ALK3 (29Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), it has been predicted that all type I receptors bind to the wrist epitope of their respective ligands irrespective of affinity. Substantiating this model, an allosteric conformational change was observed in the wrist region of BMP7 after binding to the Act RII-ECD, and this may allow for the cooperative type I/type II receptor assembly induced by TGF-β superfamily members (30Wuytens G. Verschueren K. de Winter J.P. Gajendran N. Beek L. Devos K. Bosman F. de Waele P. Andries M. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9821-9827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ligands that exhibit high affinity for type II receptors while being deficient in their ability to recruit type I receptors can act as antagonists. For example, an activin A/C chimera retaining its type II receptor binding was shown to be devoid of activin-like activity and, consequently, possessed activin and myostatin antagonistic properties (31Muenster U. Harrison C.A. Donaldson C. Vale W. Fischer W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36626-36632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, a point mutation in the finger region (M108A) of activin yielded a ligand that binds the type II receptor and has a biological activity 3 orders of magnitude lower than wt and antagonized activin A in 293T cells (32Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study we highlight the switch in affinity toward BMP type I receptor by introducing multiple residues of BMP2 or BMP7 into the activin A wrist region and the antagonistic properties of these chimeras. The ActA/BMP chimeras presented in this study were characterized with respect to their binding affinities for Act RII, their ability to disrupt activin signaling, and their ability to switch to BMP receptor I activation as well as their antagonistic properties. SDS-PAGE gels (4–12%) used were from Bio-Rad, 125I-labeled activin A was prepared using chloramine T method as described previously (33Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J.

The ActA/BMP constructs used in this study were in the pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant BMP2, BMP7, and myostatin were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Phospho-Smad1 and Phospho-Smad2 antibodies were purchased from Cellular Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Construction of Chimeras–Chimeras were generated by two-step introduction of BMP base pairs into the activin A sequence. First, plasmids containing sequences for ActA/BMP2 45–52, ActA/BMP2 73–79, ActA/BMP7 45–52, and ActA/BMP7 73–79 were generated by “long PCR” (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 12 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 58 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C; final extension, 10 min at 72 °C) using a pGem vector containing the wt activin A sequence with a FLAG tag inserted at the N terminus of the mature activin region as template and primers introducing base pairs encoding for the respective homologous BMP2 or BMP7 residues (45–52 and 73–79). Blunt linear products were ligated overnight at 16 °C using T4 ligase (Invitrogen). To subclone chimeras from pGem into pCDNA, another PCR was performed (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; final extension, 10 min at 72 °C) using the pGem plasmids containing the DNA of the chimeras as a template and a forward primer containing an NheI site 169 bp upstream of the N-terminal FLAG sequence (NheI pr) together with a reverse primer containing an XhoI site annealing to the C terminus of the chimeras (XhoI pr). The resulting products were cut with NheI and XhoI and then ligated overnight at 16 °C into an NheI-XhoI cut pCDNA cassette containing the remaining wt activin A sequence. To obtain the cassette an NheI site was introduced by silent mutation 169 bp upstream of the mature activin A in pCDNA. The Act/BMP2 45–79 and ActA/BMP7 45–79 chimeras were constructed by “overlapping PCR” using the above produced plasmids as templates. In four separate PCRs (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; final extension, 10 min at 72 °C) using pCDNA containing the sequence for either ActA/BMP2 45–52, ActA/BMP2 73–79, ActA/BMP7 45–52, and ActA/BMP7 73–79 as template together with NheI pr or XhoI pr, respectively, as well as primers introducing base pairs encoding for BMP2 or BMP7 residues 53–72, two pieces of overlapping DNA were generated for each chimera. In a second PCR (initial denaturation, 5 min at 94 °C; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and final extension, 10 min at 72 °C), the two overlapping DNAs of BMP2 (to generate ActA/BMP2 45–79) as well as the two overlapping DNAs of BMP7 (to generate ActA/BMP7 45–79) were combined, and NheI pr as well as XhoI pr were used as primers. The resulting products were cut with NheI and XhoI and ligated into the pCDNA cassette described above. All of the PCRs were performed using 2.5 units of Takara DNA polymerase (Takara, Madison, WI) along with 0.2 unit of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels (Bio-Rad). To amplify the constructs, the plasmids were transformed into Top 10 competent bacteria by chemical transformation. Mini- and maxipreps as well as gel purifications were carried out using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) kits. Expression and Purification of Chimeric Proteins–For protein expression, ActA/BMP2 and ActA/BMP7 chimeric plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using polyethyleneimine as described (34Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). In brief, 293T cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine in polylysine-coated 15-cm cell culture plates. After removal of the media, cells were washed with serum-free media, and 11 ml of serum-free medium was added to the cells. A solution of 36 μg of polyethyleneimine and 24 μg of plasmid DNA in 1.2 ml of serum-free medium was prepared, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then added to each cell culture dish. Cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 3 h, fetal calf serum was added to the cells to a final concentration of 10%. After 72 h, crude media containing chimeric proteins were harvested and filtered through a 5-μm nylon filter to separate cell debris. Then 1 m MES buffer, pH 6.2, was added to the filtrate to a final concentration of 50 mm along with 0.5 ml of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose bead suspension (Sigma). The media were left overnight at 4 °C under mild shaking conditions to allow protein binding to the beads. Then the suspension was poured into columns (10 cm × 1 cm; Bio-Rad) equipped with a one-way stop cock, the flow-through and 15 ml of additionally added 50 mm MES washing buffer were discarded, and ActA/BMP chimeras bound to the M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads were eluted in 5 fractions of each 1 ml of glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.8. Fractions were neutralized with 100 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 8, and then subjected to HPLC purification. Chimeras were separated in a single gradient run using a C4 column (2.1 × 150 mm, particle size, 5 μm; pore size, 300 Å; Vydac, Hesperia, CA) on an HP1100 HPLC machine (HP1100; Hewlett Packard). 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) as well as 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid dissolved in 90% acetonitrile (solvent B) were used as solvents. The gradient used was: min 0, 20% solvent B; min 40, 50% solvent B; min 41, 100% solvent B; min 45, 20% B, followed by a 12-min post-run with 20% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Chromatograms showed single peaks at 35.1 and 33.4 min for ActA/BMP2 and ActA/BMP7 chimeras, respectively. Peak fractions were collected, quantified by comparing the peak areas of the chimeras with those of known activin A amounts, dried down in the presence of bovine serum albumin, and redissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 mm glutamine to a final chimera concentration of 10 mg/ml and 0.01% bovine serum albumin. Proteins were stored at –80 °C. Western Blot and Silver Staining–Crude medium, anti-FLAG column eluate, and HPLC fractions were checked for ActA/BMP chimera expression by Western blot. The samples were run under reducing and nonreducing conditions on 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) along with known amounts of wt activin A as well as multi-marker (Sigma). Affinity-purified primary antibodies raised in rabbit against activin A residues 81–113 (kindly provided by Joan Vaughan, Peptide Biology Lab, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) were used in combination with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). The proteins were visualized using alkaline phosphatase substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. A protein silver staining method was used for the visualization of impurities not detectable by the βA antibody. The samples were run on 4–12% gradient SDS gels, then fixed for 15 min with 50% methanol followed by treatment for 15 min with 50 mm dithiothreitol and for 20 min with 0.1% silver nitrate solution. The excess of silver nitrate was sequestered by the addition of 25 ml of a 3% Na2CO3 solution containing 0.1% formaldehyde for 30 s. Protein bands were then visualized by the addition of another 50 ml of the 3% Na2CO3 solution containing 0.1% formaldehyde. Competitive Binding Studies of Chimeras–The Act RII binding assay was performed as previously described (32Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293T cells grown in 24-well plates coated with polylysine and seeded at a density of 150,000 cells/well were transfected with mouse Act RII using Perfectin® (GenLantis, San Diego, CA). After 48 h the cells were incubated with increasing doses of the wt activin A or chimeras in the presence of a constant amount of iodinated wt activin A tracer (200,000 cpm/well) for 2 h in HDB (12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl) containing 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgSO4. After incubation, binding buffer was removed, and the cells were washed 3 times with HEPES dissociation buffer and then lysed with 1% SDS solution for 20 min. Radioactivity in the cell lysates was measured using a γ counter (APEX Micromedic Systems, Horsham, PA). Transfection and Luciferase Assays in HepG2 Cells–HepG2 cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in α-modification of Eagle's medium (Fisher Mediatech, Pittsburgh, PA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine. Cells grown in 24-well plates (surface area ∼1.75 cm2) were transfected with the bone morphogenetic protein-responsive BRE-Luc reporter plasmid (35Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase, and pCDNA3 empty vector in a ratio of 0.9 μg/0.1 μg/0.05 μg using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 24 h, fresh medium was added, and cells were treated with increasing doses of activin A, BMP-2, BMP-7, ActA/BMP2 chimera, or ActA/BMP7 chimera as indicated for 16–24 h. Then cells were harvested in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA), and luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activities using standard methods. Transfection and Luciferase Assays in HEK 293T Cells–293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates coated with polylysine at a density of 150,000 cells/well. After 24 h cells were transfected overnight with a mixture of A3 Lux (25 ng) and β-galactosidase (25 ng) reporter plasmids, the transcription factor FAST2 (50 ng), and empty pCDNA3 vector (400 ng) using Perfectin® transfection reagent (GenLantis) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Then the cells were treated with increasing doses of wt activin A or ActA/BMP chimeras for 16–24 h. The cells were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 25 mm glycylglycine, 4 nm EGTA, 15 mm MgSO4 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using standard methods. To assess antagonistic properties of the ActA/BMP chimeras, the cells were treated alternatively either with 100 pm wt activin A or 500 pm myostatin in the presence of increasing doses of the chimeras for 16–24 h. Inhibition of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Release from Rat Interior Pituitary Cells–The assay was performed as previously described (32Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated cells from male Sprague-Dawley rat interior pituitaries from several animals were combined and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well in βPJ medium (as detailed in Ref. 36Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Bruhn T. Douglas C. Dalton D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and appropriate growth factors (36Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Bruhn T. Douglas C. Dalton D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). After 24 h cells were treated with increasing doses of wt activin A or ActA/BMP chimera (0–40 nm) in the presence or absence of 100 pm wt activin A. 72 h later media were harvested, and the concentration of the secreted FSH was determined by radioimmunoassay. Differentiation and Alkaline Phosphatase Assays in C2C12 Cells–C2C12 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Fisher Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. Cells were subjected to differentiation under low serum conditions. In brief, C2C12 cells were plated at 3 × 10 4 cells/well in 94-well plates in 50 μl of differentiation media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% horse serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine). Three hours later, cells were treated with differentiation media containing 10 nm wt activin A or wt BMPs or ActA/BMP chimeras as shown to a total volume of 100 μl/well. Cells were allowed to differentiate for 5 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator and assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity using standard methods (37Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, for quantitative alkaline phosphatase assays, triplicate wells were washed once in HDB and lysed for 60 min in 100 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm glycine, pH 9.6, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2. Lysates were incubated with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 100 mm glycine, pH 9.6, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2 until color developed and was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. Pictures of differentiated cells were taken in low magnification (20×), bright field conditions without fixation using a Canon EOS Elan II camera. Phospho-Smad Analysis in C2C12 Cells–C2C12 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. C2C12 cells were plated in 6-well plates. After 24 h cells were treated with 1 or 5 nm wt activin A, wt BMP-2, wt BMP7, or ActA/BMP chimera for 30 and 60 min. Cells were lysed on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors. The protein concentration was determined in the lysates. Total protein (67 μg) was loaded onto 10% SDS gels and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with anti-phosphorylated Smad1 (1:1000) or anti-phosphorylated Smad2 (1: 1000) by Western blotting. Bands were detected by horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence and exposure to BioMax Light Kodak film. Selection of the Region for Chimera Construction–Based on available structural information, residues involved in ALK3 binding of BMP2 are located in both wrist and finger regions of BMP2 (29Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently two activin A mutants containing a point mutation in finger 2 (32Harrison C.A.

Concurrently, these mutants were devoid of activin-like activity and consequently possessed activin and myostatin antagonistic properties. Following our hypothesis that TGF-β fami"
https://openalex.org/W2078171377,"Iron-dependent regulator (IdeR), a metal ion-activated pleiotropic transcription factor, plays a critical role in maintaining the intracellular iron homeostasis in Mycobacteria, which is important for the normal growth of the cells. This study was initially performed in an attempt to elucidate all potential interactions between the various domains of IdeR that occur in living mycobacterial cells. This led to a hitherto unidentified self-association for the SH3-like domain of IdeR. Further studies demonstrate that the SH3-like domain interacts with different partners in the dimeric forms of IdeR depending on the levels of metal ions in the environment: it undergoes inter-subunit self-association in the metal-free DNA-non-binding form, but interacts with the N-terminal domain in the metal-bound DNA-binding form in an intra-subunit manner to finely modulate the transcription repression activity of IdeR. Our more detailed mapping studies reveal that the SH3-like domain uses an overlapping surface to participate in these two interactions, which therefore occur in a mutually exclusive fashion. This novel mechanism would allow an effective and cooperative interconversion between the two functional forms of IdeR. Our data also demonstrate that a disturbance of the interactions involving the SH3-like domain impairs the transcription repression activity of IdeR and delays the growth of mycobacterial cells.

This led to a hitherto unidentified self-association for the SH3-like domain of IdeR. Further studies demonstrate that the SH3-like domain interacts with different partners in the dimeric forms of IdeR depending on the levels of metal ions in the environment: it undergoes inter-subunit self-association in the metal-free DNA-non-binding form, but interacts with the N-terminal domain in the metal-bound DNA-binding form in an intra-subunit manner to finely modulate the transcription repression activity of IdeR. Our more detailed mapping studies reveal that the SH3-like domain uses an overlapping surface to participate in these two interactions, which therefore occur in a mutually exclusive fashion. This novel mechanism would allow an effective and cooperative interconversion between the two functional forms of IdeR. Our data also demonstrate that a disturbance of the interactions involving the SH3-like domain impairs the transcription repression activity of IdeR and delays the growth of mycobacterial cells. Ferrous ion (Fe2+) is an essential cofactor for a large number of proteins, functioning in many vital physiological processes (1Andrews S. Robinson A. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, excessive free Fe2+ is extremely harmful to cells under aerobic conditions by catalyzing the formation of highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (2Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). As a result, strict cellular homeostasis of free Fe2+ must be effectively maintained for all living organisms. In mycobacteria, the iron-dependent regulator (IdeR) 3The abbreviations used are: IdeRiron-dependent regulatorAmpampicillinAtcanhydrotetracyclineDP2,2′-dipyridylDTTdithiothreitolHyghygromycinKankanamycinp-PDMp-phenylenedimaleimideTMPtrimethoprimEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinemDHFRmurine dihydrofolate reductase. 3The abbreviations used are: IdeRiron-dependent regulatorAmpampicillinAtcanhydrotetracyclineDP2,2′-dipyridylDTTdithiothreitolHyghygromycinKankanamycinp-PDMp-phenylenedimaleimideTMPtrimethoprimEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinemDHFRmurine dihydrofolate reductase. has been identified as a pleiotropic transcription regulator that regulates the expression of a number of iron-acquisition genes, thus playing a critical role in maintaining the intracellular iron homeostasis (3Schmitt M.P.

IdeR has also been found to regulate the expression of genes functioning in the storage of iron and resistance to oxidative stress (4Dussurget O. Rodriguez G.M. Smith I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Gold B. Rodriguez G.M. Marras S.A. Pentecost M. Smith I. Mol.

Voskuil M.I. Gold B. Schoolnik G.K. Smith I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3371-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Similar deletion of the ideR gene in Mycobacteria smegmatis, a non-virulent and fast growing mycobacterium, engendered the cells defective in repressing the expression of the iron-acquisition genes even in the presence of excessive iron (4Dussurget O. Rodriguez G.M. Smith I. Mol.

Homologues of IdeR have also been found in a variety of other Gram-positive bacteria (8Gunter-Seeboth K. Schupp T.

Immun. 1995; 63: 4284-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Fe2+ to IdeR/DtxR transforms it from a metal-free DNA-non-binding form to a DNA-binding form that is able to specifically bind to a conserved “iron box” operator DNA sequence (5Gold B.

Besides Fe2+, other transition metal ions such as Co2+,Ni2+,Zn2+,Cd2+, and Mn2+ are also able to activate IdeR/DtxR to its DNA-binding form under in vitro conditions (13Chou C.J. Wisedchaisri G.

Data of crystal structure determination revealed that the DNA-binding form of IdeR/DtxR exists as homo-dimers with each monomer consisting of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain connected via a highly flexible linker (15Pohl E.

The C-terminal domain was also designated as the SH3-like domain, in view of its similar folding pattern but hardly any sequence similarity to that of the commonly existing SH3 domains of eukaryotic proteins (17Feese M.D. Ingason B.P. Goranson-Siekierke J. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 76: 5959-5966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Wisedchaisri G. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol.

A. 1999; 96: 6119-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to that of the DNA-binding form, the structural information of the DNA-non-binding form of IdeR/DtxR is still very limited. Data from NMR studies revealed that the N-terminal domain of DtxR undergoes a significant conformation change during the transformation from its DNA-binding to DNA-non-binding form, changing from a well organized structure to a partially disordered “molten globule” state (21Twigg P.D. Parthasarathy G. Guerrero L. Logan T.M. Caspar D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11259-11264Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been generally believed that the IdeR/DtxR dimers dissociate into monomers during this structural transformation. Nevertheless, dimers were also occasionally observed for the DNA-non-binding form of IdeR/DtxR (13Chou C.J. Wisedchaisri G. Monfeli R.R. Oram D.M. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Beeson C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12480-12490Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which was interpreted as such that the dimerization sub-domain in the molten globule state somehow is still able to weakly mediate the dimerization process (13Chou C.J. Wisedchaisri G. Monfeli R.R. Oram D.M. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Beeson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53554-53561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Semavina M. Beckett B. Logan T.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12480-12490Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Whether regions other than the dimerization sub-domain also contribute to this dimerization process is a question that has not been addressed. The SH3-like domain has been known to play a role in forming the DNA-binding form of IdeR/DtxR, mainly based on the determination of its crystal structure (17Feese M.D. Ingason B.P. Goranson-Siekierke J. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 76: 5959-5966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Wisedchaisri G. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1155-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although hardly visible in the initially reported crystal structures of the DNA-binding forms of IdeR/DtxR (15Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25White A. Ding X. vanderSpek J.C. Murphy J.R. Ringe D. Nature. 1998; 6692: 502-506Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the SH3-like domain was later found to interact with the N-terminal domain, contributing to metal ion binding in the better refined structures (16Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Feese M.D. Ingason B.P. Goranson-Siekierke J. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 342: 1155-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In such structures, the orientation of the SH3-like domain was found to be slightly different in each of the IdeR/DtxR monomers, suggesting a dynamic nature of the interaction between the SH3-like and N-terminal domains, the meaning of which is hardly known. In an attempt to examine whether the domain-domain interactions in IdeR/DtxR revealed by these in vitro studies (17Feese M.D. Ingason B.P. Goranson-Siekierke J. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 6119-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) indeed occur in vivo, we unexpectedly revealed the hitherto unidentified self-association of the SH3-like domain of IdeR. Further in vitro studies demonstrate that this novel interaction largely occurs in the DNA-non-binding form of IdeR in the absence of metal binding, using a surface that overlaps with the one used by the SH3-like domain to interact with the N-terminal domain. The physiological significance of these interactions involving the SH3-like domain was also demonstrated in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Escherichia coli DH5α, Top10, and BL21(DE3) strains were cultured routinely in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C. M. smegmatis ATCC607 was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid media or on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates (supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 80, and the indicated antibiotics). M63 minimal media (supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 1 mm MgSO4, and the indicated antibiotics) were used in survival assays for protein-protein interaction detection. M. tuberculosis H37Rv was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid media or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates (supplemented with 10% oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase, 0.5% glycerol, and 0.5% Tween 80 and the indicated antibiotics). For colony-forming unit counting, M. tuberculosis H37Rv cells were cultured on Löwenstein-Jensen medium. Concentrations for chemicals and/or antibiotics added in the culture media were as follows: ampicillin (Amp) at 100 μg/ml, kanamycin (Kan) at 50 μg/ml (for the E. coli) or 25 μg/ml (for M. smegmatis), hygromycin (Hyg) at 200-250 μg/ml (for the Escherichia coli) or 50 μg/ml (for Mycobacteria), trimethoprim (TMP) at 10 μg/ml, anhydrotetracycline (Atc) at 50 ng/ml. The M. smegmatis strains were routinely cultured at 37 °C except for protein-protein interaction detection, where the culture temperature was shifted to 30 °C. M. tuberculosis H37Rv strains were routinely cultured at 37 °C. Construction of the Plasmids Used for Detecting Protein-Protein Interactions in Mycobacteria—In our developed mycobacterial mDHFR-protein fragment complementation assay system, the two fusion proteins were expressed from two compatible E. coli-Mycobacteria shuttle vectors, designated as pLCTetR1/2 and pLC3, respectively (see Fig. 1A). pLCTetR1/2 is an extra-chromosomal plasmid with four to eight copies in each mycobacteria cell; however, pLC3 is an integrative plasmid with only a single copy in each mycobacterial cell. The pLCTetR1/2 vector was constructed as follows. The DNA fragment containing P1/tetO sequence was prepared as described (26Ehrt S. Guo X.V. Hickey C.M. Rvou M. Monteleone M. Riley L.W. Schnappinger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and then was digested with HindIII and EcoRV before being subcloned into the pAL5,000-originated E. coli-mycobacteria shuttle vector pSUM40 (kindly provided by Dr. Ainsa (27Ainsa J.A. Martin C. Cabeza M. de la Cruz F. Mendiola M.V. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 176: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Subsequently inserted into this plasmid was an EcoRV and KpnI double-digested DNA fragment encoding yeast GCN4 protein, a (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)2 flexible polylinker and the mDHFR F[1,2] fusion protein, as amplified from the plasmid pBluscript-mDHFR-F[1,2] (kindly provided by Prof. Michnick (28Pelletier J.N. Campbell-Valois F.X. Michnick S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12141-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). The region encoding GCN4 in this new plasmid was removed by digesting with EcoRV and ClaI and then replaced by an oligonucleotide fragment encoding the FLAG tag and a multiple cloning site (see Fig. 1A for its detailed sequence). The constructed plasmid was named as pDFmyc1/2. Finally, a DNA fragment encoding the tetR gene of the E. coli Tn10 transposon (amplified from the genome of E. coli XL1-blue and the intrinsic HindIII restriction site of the tetR gene was synonymously mutated via overlapping PCR) was fused to the downstream of a DNA fragment containing the Hsp60 promoter of M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (amplified from the genome of M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin) via overlapping PCR, before being digested with HindIII and inserted into pDFmyc1/2. The plasmid with transcriptions controlled by PHsp60 and P1/tetO promoters in opposite directions was selected and designated as pLCTetR1/2. The pLC3 vector was constructed as follows. The first step of the construction was with virtually the same procedure as that for generating pDFmyc1/2 except that the DNA fragment encoding yeast GCN4 protein, a (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)2 flexible polylinker and the mDHFR-F[3] fusion protein was amplified from the plasmid pBluescript-mDHFR-F[3] (kindly provided by Dr. Michnick (28Pelletier J.N. Campbell-Valois F.X. Michnick S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12141-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)). The new constructed plasmid was thus designated as pDFmyc3. The DNA fragment encoding test protein (designated as X here) was then inserted into the multiple cloning site (all were inserted between NotI and BamHI in this study) of pDFmyc3. To avoid potential incompatibility between the pLCtetR1/2 and pLCmyc3, the whole expression cassette of DHFR-F[3] fusion proteins was unloaded by cleaving with HindIII and KpnI and then inserted into the pMV306(HygR) vector (kindly provided by Dr. Clifton Barry, National Institutes of Health) to generate pLC3-X. The physical maps of pLCTetR1/2 and pLC3 can be obtained upon request. Detection of Protein-Protein Interactions in M. smegmatis—pLCTetR1/2 and pLC3 carrying the DNA-fragment encoding the indicated test proteins (each ∼300 ng) were co-transformed into M. smegmatis-competent cells by electroporation. Co-transformed bacteria were selected on Middlebrook 11 agar media (containing 0.5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml Amp, 25 μg/ml Kan, and 50 μg/ml Hyg) at 37 °C. The well separated colonies were then transferred into liquid Middlebrook 7H9 media (supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 80, and the same amount of above three antibiotics) and grown at 37 °C to late log phase. The cultured cells were washed twice with M63 medium, diluted to A600 0.001, before being spotted onto M63 agar plates (supplemented with 0.5% glycerol, the three antibiotics, 10 μg/ml TMP, and 50 ng/ml Atc) and cultured at 30 °C for ∼5-7 days. The test was performed at 30 °C instead of 37 °C to avoid any possible impairment of high temperature on the folding and subsequent interaction of the fusion proteins, as demonstrated by Pelletier et al. (28Pelletier J.N. Campbell-Valois F.X. Michnick S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12141-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) when applying mDHFR-protein fragment complementation assay in E. coli. Site-specific Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—DNA encoding full-length IdeR was amplified from the genome of M. smegmatis ATCC607 directly. The DNA fragments encoding all IdeR variants were digested with NcoI and NotI before being subcloned onto pET21bm (a modified pET21b plasmid in which the initial NdeI restriction site was mutated to a NcoI restriction site) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. His tags were fused to the C termini of all expressed proteins for the purposes of affinity purification and Western blot detection. The sequences of encoding genes were all verified by DNA sequencing. The detailed sequences of all primers used in this study can be found in supplemental Table S2. For protein expression, all E. coli transformants were cultured in LB/Amp media at 37 °C to A600 ∼0.5, induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h before being harvested by centrifugation. All recombinant proteins were purified according to the following procedure. The cells were re-suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole, at pH 7.4 (5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was also added for the purification of the cysteine-substituted proteins) before being lysed by ultra-sonication. The cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation, loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column before the bound IdeR proteins were eluted with 100-500 mm imidazole. Collected protein samples were then dialyzed against a dialysis buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to remove the imidazole (5 mm dithiothreitol was also added in the dialysis buffer for cysteine-substituted IdeR mutant proteins) and stored at -80 °C before use. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA-based method using bovine serum albumin as standard. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed on aÁCTA Purifier system using a pre-packed Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences Biotech). Protein sample (100 μl) was loaded and then eluted with buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The elution profile was recorded as the value of the light absorption at 220 nm (due to the absence of Trp, Tyr, and Phe residues in the SH3-like domain of IdeR). Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking—Cross-linking of purified SH3-like domain of IdeR was carried out with glutaraldehyde by the following procedures. The purified proteins (1 mg/ml) were first treated with indicated concentration of glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, and then quenched on ice with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for another 10 min. The cross-linked products were then analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Non-denaturing Pore Gradient PAGE—Non-denaturing pore gradient polyacrylamide gel with a gradient from 6% to 45% was prepared mainly according to the methods described by Ausubel et al. (29Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingdom R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Wiley, New York1997Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed at 100 V for indicated time at a temperature of 4 °C. Molecular Docking and Structure Analysis—Homo-multimeric docking of the SH3-like domains of IdeR was carried out utilizing the ClusPro program (30Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J. Bioinformatics. 2003; 20: 45-50Crossref Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 31Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J.

The selection of residues for cysteine scanning mutagenesis described in Fig. 3 was based on following two criteria: (i) it should be located at or near the interaction surface of docked oligomers; (ii) Cα-Cα distances between two same residue on assembled oligomers should be <10 Å. The analysis of crystal structures and the calculation of the distances between indicated residues were all performed with PyMOL. Detection of Disulfide Bonds—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with plasmid pET21m which carries the DNA fragment encoding the SH3-like domain with the indicated position being substituted with cysteine residue. The transformed cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h (37 °C), collected, and re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1.4 mm K2HPO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, before being lysed by ultrasonication and clarified by centrifugation. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by BCA method. Formation of disulfide bonds in cysteine-substituted SH3-like domains was induced by ambient oxygen during the ultrasonication treatment. The non-reducing condition was kept by the addition of 5× Laemmli loading buffer (supplemented with 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 25 mm EDTA). The reducing condition was maintained by the addition of 50 mm DTT in replaced of N-ethylmaleimide and EDTA into the 5× loading buffer. The samples separated with 12% SDS-PAGE (50 μg each lane) were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected with monoclonal antibody against His tag. The bands were visualized immunochemically by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG. Cysteine-specific Cross-linking—The cysteine-specific cross-linking was performed according to methods previously described (33Bonner J.J. Chen D. Storey K. Tushan M. Lea K. J. Mol.

Briefly, protein samples were treated with o- or p-PDM (at 500 μm, dissolved in Me2SO) and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min (Me2SO alone was added for negative control). The reaction was stopped by quenching with 10 mm DTT. The active or inactive forms of the IdeR proteins (of ∼2 μm) were maintained, respectively, by adding 200 μm CoCl2 or 3 mm DP for 10 min at room temperature before cross-linking treatment. Spin Labeling and EPR Measurements—Spin labeling of the IdeR(C102D/H173C) protein and the following EPR measurement were performed as previously described (35Wu J. Voss J. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10123-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, purified IdeR(C102D/H173C) protein (at 5 mg/ml) was first dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 3 h to remove the trace amount of DTT before being labeled with 1 mm maleimide-PROXYL overnight at 4 °C. The labeled samples were concentrated to a final concentration of 250 μm by ultrafiltration after all free probes were removed by thoroughly dialysis (against with 20 mm Tris-HCl, containing 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The EPR spectra were collected over an 80-Gauss scan width (at room temperature) or over 120-Gauss scan width (at 150 K) using the modulation amplitude of 2.5 Gauss and a microwave power of 8 milliwatts. EMSA—Binding of IdeR to operator DNA was performed as described by Spiering et al. (23Spiering M. Ringe D. Murthy J. Marletta M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3808-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 33-bp mbtA operator DNA was prepared by directly annealing two synthesized complemented oligonucleotides (one was labeled with FAM at its 5′-end). The binding reaction mixture was incuba"

The data unravel a possible molecular mechanism for Rem2-induced angiogenesis and suggests Rem2 as a potential novel target for treating pathological angiogenesis. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a complex process that involves many steps including endothelial cell proliferation, migration and invasion, tube formation, and vessel maturation. Angiogenesis is involved in disease states such as arthritis and atherosclerosis, and is particularly important for the growth, invasion, and metastatic spread of tumors (1Weidner N. Folkman J. Important Adv. Oncol. 1996; : 167-190PubMed Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 1211-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation is therefore of obvious importance, very little is known about cell cycle control in endothelial cells. The Ink4a-Arf locus encodes two tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and p19ARF (p14 ARF in humans) that up-regulate the activities of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) 3The abbreviations used are: Rbretinoblastoma proteinRGKRem/Rad/Gem/KirHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellHMEChuman microvascular endothelial cellGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRNAiRNA interferenceHAhemagglutininWTwild typeshRNAshort hairpin RNACMVcytomegalovirusCaMcalmodulin.3The abbreviations used are: Rbretinoblastoma proteinRGKRem/Rad/Gem/KirHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellHMEChuman microvascular endothelial cellGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRNAiRNA interferenceHAhemagglutininWTwild typeshRNAshort hairpin RNACMVcytomegalovirusCaMcalmodulin. and the p53 transcription factor, respectively (3Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The p16INK4a protein inhibits the activity of cyclin D-dependent kinases, thereby maintaining Rb in its hypophosphorylated, growth-suppressive state (3Sherr C.J. McCormick F. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). p19ARF antagonizes Mdm2 activity, resulting in a p53 transcriptional response that leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Loss of p16INK4a or p19ARF function is a critical event for tumor promotion as evidenced by extinguished expression of the p16INK4a and p19ARF protein in a variety of tumors (4Ruas M. Peters G.

Interestingly, p19ARF loss affects the normal development of the eyes of newborn mice, where persistence of the hyaloid vasculature in the vitreous results in destruction of both the lens and neuroretina, directly implicating p19ARF in regulation of pathological angiogenesis (6McKeller R.N.

Rem2 is a recently identified member of the Rem/Rad/Gem/Kir (RGK) family of Ras-related GTPases that share structural features that are different from other Ras-related proteins (8Finlin B.S. Shao H.

These include non-conservative amino acid substitutions within regions known to be involved in guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, extended N and C termini, and a conserved C-terminal motif thought to mediate membrane association but lacking a prenylation site present in other Ras-like molecules (10Del Villar K.

Two important functions of RGK proteins are the regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity and cell shape associated with angiogenesis (11Finlin B.S. Crump S.M. Satin J. Andres D.A. Proc.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RGK proteins interact with 14-3-3 and calmodulin and Gem regulates endothelial shape changes required for angiogenesis (12Piddini E. Schmid J.A. de Martin R. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4076-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that 14-3-3, together with calmodulin, regulates the subcellular distribution of Rem2 between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and this distribution has been correlated to cell shape changes (12Piddini E. Schmid J.A. de Martin R. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4076-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N. Yamada Y. Seino Y.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1923-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, given past research efforts, little is known about the cell function of the RGK family of GTPases, particularly Rem2. Here we show a novel function for Rem2 as a suppressor of p19ARF transcription, partially dependent on 14-3-3 protein binding to promote accelerated endothelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that ectopic Rem2 promotes angiogenesis in vitro and is expressed in endothelial cells of the RIP1 tag2 mouse model of pancreatic disease. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Infection–Large T SV40 temperature-sensitive endothelial cells (ts T endothelial cells) were subcloned from a polyclonal population of brain capillary endothelial cell line, derived from H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mice, and display endothelial cell-specific characters, such as expression of von Willebrand factor and uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein (16Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty clones were expanded and 3 clones selected based on the lowest number of background colonies that grew at 39 °C. Experiments were performed with clones 5 and 12 (LTEC5 and LTEC12: large T endothelial Cell 5 and 12) that have virtually no background growth at 39 °C (see Fig. 1). The functional screen was carried out with clone LTEC5, which showed lowest background in repetitive experiments, and genes discovered were later retested in mouse ts T endothelial cells LTEC5 and LTEC12. All results are shown with LTEC5 cell line. Ecotropic retroviral supernatants were produced by transfection of genes into Phoenix packaging cells by calcium-phosphate precipitation. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the tissue culture medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and added to target cells. High titer retroviral library supernatants derived from mouse whole brain (Clontech) were used to infect 2 × 106 ts T endothelial cells. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were plated at a density of ∼1 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish and 48 h after infection the cells were shifted to 39 °C (the non-permissive temperature for the transforming SV40 T antigen). Colonies of cells appeared only in the library-infected populations. These colonies were picked, expanded, and pro-viral inserts identified by re-cloning into library vector (pLIB) and identified by sequencing. To analyze whether the rescue was due to expression of a retroviral library-derived cDNA, a second round with re-cloned library cDNA was performed. Primary HUVECs were isolated from umbilical veins and cultured in medium containing RPMI 1640 and M199 (1:1), 20% human serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 33 mg/ml glutamine. 500,000 HUVECs at passage 2-3 were electroporated with 9 μg of RGK expressing vector by a previously described method (17Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to recover and 200,000 cells plated on fibronectin-coated plates to determine growth rate after 3 days. Immunohistochemistry was performed concurrently as described below. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum on gelatin-coated plates. Ecotropic receptor was electroporated into HMEC-1 cells following a described method and clones selected with Zeomycin. Stable HMEC-1 ecotropic receptor expressing cells were then infected with high titer GFP, Rem2HA, or Ras v12 virus and injected into mice for Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay (see below). cDNA and RNAi Constructs–For overexpression studies we used the TBX3, pBabe Zeo Ecotropic Receptor, LZRS-p19ARF (RED), pBabe-Ras v12, and GFP constructs as previously described (18Brummelkamp T.R.

Following identification of Rem2 from the functional screen, wild type mouse Rem2 was constructed by PCR from the same library used in the screen (whole brain pLib-cDNA retroviral library from Clontech). Primers for Rem2 with a N-terminal HA tag where designed and cloned back into pLib vector (same as cDNA library) using EcoRI and NotI sites (forward, 5′-gatcGAATTCGCCATGGCTTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCGCACGTGCCCTACAAACACGAGCTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-gatcGCGGCCGCTCAGAGCACAGAGAGGTCGTGACATGACCTGGA-3′). We reasoned that wild type (WT) Rem2 was more biologically relevant than a constitutively active mutant because WT Rem2 would be dependent on GDP-GTP cycling and specific GEFs or GAPs in the cell. 4Dr. John Collard, personal communication. For transient expression studies, wild type Rem2 cloned into Myc-tagged pME18S constructs were a kind gift from Walter Hunziker and Pascal Beguin (13Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H.

Rem2 14-3-3 and CaM point binding mutants (Myc tagged) were also provided by Walter Hunziker and Pascal Beguin. For mouse p53 shRNAi the sequence is published elsewhere (19Dirac A.M. Bernards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11731-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For mouse p19ARF we targeted the following sequence: GTTCGTGCGATCCCGGAGA. RNAi directed against 14-3-3γ was cloned into pSUPER and was a gift from Dr. T. Suzuki (20Sumioka A. Nagaishi S. Yoshida T. Lin A. Miura M. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42364-42374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For mouse Rem2 we targeted the following Rem2 sequences: 1) GCGGCGGGCCCAAGCTGTA, 2) GCCCGCTCCCGGGAGGTAT, and 3) CGGGGGATGCCTTTCTCAT. Western Blotting, Immunohistochemistry, and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter–Western blots were probed with antibodies against: 14-3-3γ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), α-tubulin (Sigma), p53 (Santa Cruz), p21 (Santa Cruz), p14ARF (Neomarker), p19ARF (Abcam), CDK4 (Santa Cruz), HA tag (Santa Cruz), Myc tag (4AE Roche), Cyclin A (Santa Cruz), Cyclin D (Santa Cruz), p107 (Santa Cruz), and p27 (Santa Cruz). A polyclonal antibody for Rem2 was developed against the following peptide sequence CVPRNAKFFKQRSRS. The day 28 bleed was used at 1:750 dilution in 1% milk TBS, Tween 20. Western blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) following the instructions of the manufacturer. For visualization of actin, we used BODIPY 650/665-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). For detection of trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9 a polyclonal anti-H3K9-Me antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were used. 300 cells displaying only high levels of signal were selected and the number of cells containing trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 were counted by light microscopy (equivalent expression levels to cells at 39 °C). Myc-tagged Rem2 was detected using 9E10 and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) as a secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained using TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes). Cells were embedded in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, VT) and analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM510 with the appropriate filter settings. For the quantification of nuclear exclusion of Rem2 and its mutants, 60-70 Rem2 expressing cells from three independent experiments were randomly selected and a single confocal xy-plane was imaged through the middle of the cell. Rem2 exclusion was arbitrarily scored as none, partial, or complete based on its colocalization with the nuclear TO-PRO-3. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR–Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and a subsequent clean-up RNeasy protocol (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). 250 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA following instructions from the manufacturers and the resulting cDNA was analyzed by PCR. Primers for p19ARF used were: Exon 1β forward: 5′-GTCGCAGGTTCTTGGTCACTGTGA-3 and Exon 2 of p16 reverse: 5′-GTCCTCGCAGTTCGAATCTGC-3′. Primers for mouse Rem2 were: forward, 5′-CGTGGGGGAGAGTGGCGTGGG-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACGAGTGTTGTGGTGGAGAGC-3′ producing a 445-bp fragment. Primers were annealed at 60 °C at 27-35 cycles as described in the figures. Colony Formation Assay and β-Galactosidase Staining–Cells were plated at low density after retroviral infection with genes of interest and left at 32 °C overnight. The following day, plates were shifted to 39 °C and left for 2-6 weeks, depending on the gene being investigated. Plates were then washed, fixed in methanol, and stained with Coomassie Blue for 1 h, washed, and air-dried. β-Galactosidase staining was performed as described before and 300 cells counted for blue signal per condition described (21Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5650) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of cell numbers of colony formation assay was performed using Student's t test with Excel software. Luciferase Assays–Equal numbers of HEK cells were transfected with 1-3 mg of CMV-RGK, 2 mg of luciferase construct, and 1 mg of CMV-β-galactosidase. Total protein was measured and 4 mg measured for luciferase activity and 8 mg for β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase counts were corrected to β-galactosidase levels. Matrigel Tube Formation, Scratch Assay, and RIP1 tag2 Model–Matrigel tube formation assay was performed by applying growth factor-reduced Matrigel in 24-well plates, allowed to polymerize, and 1 × 105 cells were seeded in serum-free media for 16 h. Tube formation was photographed and assessed. Scratch assay was performed by plating an equal number of cells in gelatin-coated plates, grown to confluence, scratched at least five times with a plastic pipette tip, and migrated into the wound photographed the following day. Frozen sections of the angiogenic model of pancreatic carcinoma, RIP1 tag2, were provided by Dr. Oriol Casanovas. Briefly, sections were fixed in acetone at -20 °C for 10 min, blocked in 0.3% H2O2 for 5 min, 20% horse serum for 30 min and 1:200 dilution of Rem2, rabbit serum (from control rabbit), or CD31 (Pharmingen) applied overnight in 10% horse serum/phosphate-buffered saline. The next day sections were developed using an ABC method (Vector) with dimethylaminoazobenzene (rapid stain), counterstained with hematoxylin (1:5 dilution), mounted in DepEx, and visualized with light microscopy. Blood vessel count was assessed in 10-μm serial sections (first section for CD31, second section for Rem2) using “hot spot” methodology described previously (1Weidner N. Folkman J. Important Adv. Oncol. 1996; : 167-190PubMed Google Scholar). Functional Screen in Endothelial Cells Identifies Rem2–To study the genes involved in the p53/Rb pathway in mouse endothelial cells, we subcloned a mouse endothelial cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 T antigen (ts T) to identify a clone with no background in repetitive experiments (16Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were given the acronym LTEC5 for Large T endothelial cell, clone number 5. This mutant binds and inactivates both pRb and p53 at 32 °C allowing the cells to proliferate indefinitely at this temperature. At 39 °C, however, the mutant T antigen is degraded, so that p53 and pRb are released, resulting in cell cycle arrest (see Fig. 1A, inset i). Acidic β-galactosidase staining of endothelial cells and their flattened morphology suggests that 91% of cells undergo a senescence-like arrest at 39 °C (Fig. 1A, insets i and ii). To further characterize the cell cycle arrest we assessed the state of trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9, an established marker of cell senescence (22Braig M. Lee S. Loddenkemper C. Rudolph C. Peters A.H. Schlegelberger B. Stein H. Dorken B. Jenuwein T. Schmitt C.A. Nature. 2005; 436: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). We found that 99.6% of cells express high levels of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 at 39 °C, and only 1.3% of cells at 32 °C express similar levels to the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 1A, insets iii and iv). Furthermore, we found that the endothelial cell cycle arrest is reversible supporting other data that rodent senescence is p53 dependent and reversible (see supplementary information, Fig. S1, panel A) (19Dirac A.M. Bernards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11731-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Finally, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the mouse endothelial cells demonstrates that they arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (see supplementary information, Fig. S1, panel B). To investigate whether cell cycle arrest in these endothelial cells is dependent on the p53 pathway, a main regulator of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we used shRNA-mediated persistent RNA interference to knock down the p53 and p19ARF tumor suppressor genes. Fig. 1B shows that reduced levels of p53 and p19ARF proteins rescue the temperature shift-induced cell cycle arrest and thus causes immortalization at 39 °C. The results indicate that the endothelial cell arrest at 39 °C is dependent on the p53 pathway in endothelial cells (Fig. 1B). Given that loss of p19ARF or p53 resulted in rescue of the cell cycle arrest, we propose an in vitro genetic model to screen for genes that can modulate the p53-induced senescence-like cell cycle arrest in mouse endothelial cells (Fig. 1, A and B). A functional genomic screen was performed in the ts T mouse endothelial cells using a mouse whole brain cDNA library (Clontech). Sequencing genomic DNA recovered from a rare colony that proliferated at 39 °C identified Rem2. Rem2 is a new member of the RGK family of Ras-like GTPases (Rad, Gem (Kir), Rem and Rem2), which have a previously described role in aspects of the angiogenic cascade (12Piddini E. Schmid J.A. de Martin R. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4076-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Pan J.Y. Fieles W.E. White A.M. Egerton M.M. Silberstein D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consequently, we focused on Rem2. Re-cloning wild type Rem2 into the same vector from the library, we found that ectopic Rem2 rescued the p53 cell cycle arrest to immortalize endothelial cells (Fig. 2A). As a control already known to regulate the p53 pathway via p19ARF suppression (18Brummelkamp T.R. Kortlever R.M. Lingbeek M. Trettel F. MacDonald M.E. van Lohuizen M. Bernards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6567-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we overexpressed TBX3 and found that the endothelial cell cycle arrest was rescued (Fig. 2, A and B). Oncogenic Ras (Ras v12) expression caused endothelial cell cycle arrest as expected (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of expression of the ectopic Rem2 protein after 2 weeks reveals that it is not degraded at 39 °C and therefore was sufficient to rescue a p53 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we focused on the role of Rem2 in endothelial cells. Rem2 Suppresses p19ARF/p14ARF Expression in Endothelial Cells–To elucidate the mechanism of the Rem2-induced bypass of the p53-dependent endothelial cell cycle arrest, endothelial cell clones that overexpress Rem2 at 39 °C were picked and expanded for further analysis. A total of 13 clones were first analyzed for SV40 Large T antigen (T) and Rem2 expression levels (see supplementary information, Fig. S2, panel A). Next we determined the p53 status of those endothelial clones that expressed various levels of Rem2 and not T (see supplementary information, Fig. S2 panel B). Cisplatin causes activation of wild type p53 and subsequently one of its targets, p21CIP, making it a useful tool to determine whether p53 is wild type and functional. Following treatment with cisplatin, p53 and p21CIP were both activated in all endothelial cell clones, demonstrating that ectopic Rem2 expression was able to bypass a wild type p53-induced cell cycle arrest and that this response was uniform for all clones. We continued to investigate those endothelial clones that expressed a range from low to high levels of Rem2 protein expression with a wild type p53. Because p53/Rb regulate the G1 phase of the cell cycle (see supplementary information, Fig. S1, panel B), we next performed Western blot analyses of genes regulating the G1-S phase of the endothelial cell cycle (see supplementary information, Fig. S2, panel C) and found that the most significant change caused by ectopic Rem2 was the suppression of p19ARF protein levels (Fig. 3A). To verify that ectopic Rem2 specifically regulated the p19ARF protein levels, we designed three individual shRNA constructs to knock down Rem2, resulting in ∼70% knockdown (Fig. 3B, inset i). The use of three shRNAi constructs reduces the chances of off target effects to nil. Loss of ectopic Rem2 by shRNAi resulted in restoration of the p53 pathway, with increased p19ARF and p53 protein levels following Rem2 RNAi treatment with any of the three individual constructs (Fig. 3B, inset ii). Moreover, functional analyses demonstrated that loss of ectopic Rem2 resulted in reduced colony formation at 39 °C, not seen in p53 and Rem2 RNAi double-treated cells (Fig. 3B, inset iii, first 4 panels). This data supports the idea that ectopic Rem2 suppresses p19ARF expression leading to increased proliferation. Loss of endogenous Rem2 in p53 null-treated endothelial cells had no effect on colony formation assay suggesting that activation of Rem2 is needed before suppressing p19ARF expression (Fig. 3B, inset iii, fourth panel). To further establish that the Rem2-mediated effects on p19ARF are needed for proliferation we overexpressed p19ARF in Rem2 expressing mouse endothelial cell clones by retroviral infection (70% infection levels) and performed colony formation assay. Re-introduction of p19ARF expression inhibited Rem2-induced proliferation demonstrating that p19ARF is essential for the proliferative effects of ectopic expression of Rem2 (Fig. 3B, inset iii, bottom left panel). The use of a GFP RNAi construct demonstrates that the effects of the Rem2 RNAi on proliferation are specific (Fig. 3B, inset iii, bottom right panel). Quantification of the colony formation assay demonstrates the clear differences between treatments (Fig. 3B, inset iv). To further investigate the mechanism of regulation of p19ARF by Rem2, we assessed the mRNA levels following Rem2 ectopic expression. Using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR we found that the endogenous levels of Rem2 mRNA are low in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (Fig. 3C, last lane). We found that in mouse endothelial cell clones, which at 39 °C expressed low to moderate levels of Rem2 based on protein expression (see supplementary information, Fig. S1, panel B), p19ARF was transcriptionally suppressed (Fig. 3C). Next, we determined where ectopic Rem2 localizes in the cells. In agreement with previous work we found that ectopic Rem2 was localized in the cytoplasm of mouse endothelial Rem2 clones (13Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D and see supplementary information, Fig. S4, panel B). The use of antibodies against the HA tag confirm the cytoplasmic location of the ectopic Rem2 protein. This suggests that the effect of Rem2 on the p53 pathway is indirect. To functionally assess if Rem2 can accelerate primary HUVEC proliferation rates and to rule out any effects of SV40 large T antigen that may have been undetected in the mouse endothelial cells (see supplemental Fig. 2B), we overexpressed wild type Rem2 and measured primary HUVEC proliferation. Ectopic WT Rem2 increased HUVEC proliferation rates above controls, demonstrating that ectopic Rem2 induces endothelial cell proliferation (Fig. 3E, inset i). Importantly we found that ectopic Rem2 completely suppressed p14ARF protein expression in HUVEC, supporting the data in mouse endothelial cells that overexpressed Rem2 suppresses p14ARF and p19ARF expression (Fig. 2E, inset ii). 14-3-33 Protein Binding Is Involved in Cell Localization of Rem2 and Suppression of p19ARF Expression–We found Rem2 in the cytoplasm and so investigated a role for 14-3-3 proteins in mediating the Rem2 effects for three reasons. First, Rem2 and 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to physically interact in the cytoplasm (13Beguin P. Mahalakshmi R.N. Nagashima K. Cher D.H. Kuwamura N. Yamada Y. Seino Y. Hunziker W. Biochem.
