https://openalex.org/W2133058625,"Studies of germanium and silicon by x-ray diffraction reveal that their crystal structure changes at high pressures from the semiconducting diamond-type structure to the metallic white tin structure, in analogy to the known ""gray"" to ""white"" transition in tin itself."
https://openalex.org/W2036448590,"In two laboratories utilizing different age subjects and recording techniques, Negro subjects had higher skin resistance than a comparable white population. There was no difference in other autonomic variables or autonomic reactivity. Reasons for this racial difference may offer a better physiological explanation for galvanic skin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2090319205,"For a hundred years students of the Pleistocene have looked for evidence of the climatic change which initiated the Pleistocene epoch. Glacial deposits on the continents have been of little help because of their discontinuity and because of the destructive effect of later glaciations. Hence, Pleistocene geologists have turned to the uplifted Pliocene-Pleistocene marine sediments of the Mediterranean region. In the absence of evidence of a single, clearly defined climatic change in this sedimentary section, they have agreed to define the beginning of the Pleistocene by the first appearance of Anomalina baltica, a species of benthic Foraminifera tolerant of cool water. This definition leaves much to be desired: It rests on a single benthic species whose areal distribution must have been partly determined by local conditions on the sea floor; it is useless outside of the Mediterranean region; and there is no convincing evidence that the first appearance of Anomalina baltica in the Mediterranean coincided with the onset of the first glaciation."

Uric acid appears in the excreta when it is a dietary constituent, although most of it is apparently absorbed and stored internally. Surprisingly, ammonia is a major excretory product."
https://openalex.org/W1965381818,"A recessive gene immutans (im) is responsible for abnormal chloroplast development which results in variegation in Arabidopsis plants. Somatic mutability is simulated, though only functional disorder is involved. Cysteine and low temperature favor normal function, while homocysteine interferes with chloroplast development without producing an adverse effect on the growth of the mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2003048700,Absorption lines in the ν2 band of water vapor at 6.3 micrometers have been fully resolved by using a tunable semiconductor laser. Three atmospheric water vapor lines near 5.32 micrometers were studied in detail and found to have line widths two to four times narrower than the width calculated by Benedict and Kaplan.
https://openalex.org/W2086518385,"A biochemical polymorphism of coelomic hemerythrin has been found in the sipunculid Golfingia gouldii; the electrophoretically ""fast"" and ""slow"" coelomic hemerythrins differ in their oxygen equilibria and by a single peptide in tryptic and chymotryptic ""fingerprints."" All individuals of this sipunculid have the same vascular hemerythrin, which is electrophoretically different from any of the coelomic hemerythrins. Vascular and coelomic hemerythrins of another sipunculid, Dendrostomum cymodoceae, have quite different ""fingerprints."" Thus, on the basis of two separate types of evidence the tissue-specific hemerythrins appear to have a distinct genetic basis. The embryological and phylogenetic implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2062011899,"Tape recordings were made of the underwater noises of captive sea lions swimming in a concrete pool at night. When approaching pieces of fish that were thrown into the water, the sea lions emitted trains of sound signals like those of the bat and the porpoise. A detailed analysis of these noises shows that they meet the criteria of a pulse-modulated sonar system and, in fact, reveal an amazing sophistication so far as echo ranging is concerned."
https://openalex.org/W1990763320,"Immature octopods (Tremoctopus violaceus) have been found with numerous fragments of tentacles of the coelenterate Physalia attached to the suckers of their dorsal arms. The probable method of acquisition, the evidence of adaptation for holding the tentacles, and the possibility that the octopod uses these coelenterate tentacles as offensive and defensive weapons are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2066280795,"Wheat mutants with increased seedling resistance to terbutryn (2-tert-butylamino-4-ethylamino-6-methylthio-s-triazine) and tomato mutants with increased resistance to diphenamid (N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide) were selected by the experimenters out of populations grown from seeds treated with ethyl methanesulfonate. Induced mutations may thus provide a tool for breeding crop cultivars with increased resistance to certain herbicides."

https://openalex.org/W2018643507,"Measurements of the potassium and argon content of the Sikhote Alin iron meteorite, by activation analysis, enable a potassium-argon ""age"" of 1.7 × 109 years to be calculated. Such an age is vastly different from all the ages previously measured for iron meteorites."

https://openalex.org/W1977822824,"The production of air pollution instrumentation is a rapidly growing sphere of interest. Air pollution instruments can be divided into two classes; those for measuring pollutant concentrations in the immediate proximity of the instrument, and those for measuring concentrations over a long path length or at locations remote from the instrument. With few exceptions, the latter category comprises laser-based instruments that are still in early stages of development. The most widely used instruments currently are based on wet chemical techniques, which were among the first to be developed and whose capabilities are thus most clearly defined by experimental data. Electrochemical transducers appear to represent a significant advance in pollutant detection. Gas chromatography is being used increasingly for pollutant monitoring because of its ability to separate similar pollutants before their concentrations are measured. An alternative, and potentially more promising physical method is microwave spectroscopy. Solid state electrochemical transducers are another development that holds promise. Miniature electrochemical cells constructed using solid electrolytes exhibit a conductivity above a voltage threshold characteristic of each gas, and the conductivity varies linearly with gas concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2026558531,"Lipoproteins from patients receiving therapeutic doses of iodine-131 were isolated by density-gradient techniques. The binding of circulating thyroid hormones by beta lipoproteins (those of low density) was negligible. Alpha lipoproteins (those of high density) bound appreciable amounts. The bulk, however, was bound by proteins of density higher than 1.23 g/ml."

https://openalex.org/W2252295117,"In Shapley's report on the use of rain-making as a weapon in Indochina, a number of scientists express their opposition to such practices. Although one can sympathize with scientists who see their research put to ends other than those they envisioned, it is short-sighted to carp against each new technique for warfare. Wars seem to be part of human existence, and there are degrees of inhumanity in the way wars are fought. It would seem that causing a rainstorm to turn a terrain to mud is a more humane way of fighting than bombing the area. In World War I, millions of soldiers were ordered to leave their trenches and charge the opposing lines, whereupon they were gunned down. Should we return to that mode of fighting as a more humane method? We may wish that there were no wars. But we may wish that in vain. A more useful approach may be to study how to conduct wars in ways that destroy or maim fewer people than has hitherto been the case. Language: en"
