https://openalex.org/W2071430673,"The small proteoglycan decorin is known to interact with type I collagen fibrils, thereby influencing the kinetics of fibril formation and the distance between adjacent collagen fibrils. The structurally related proteoglycan biglycan has been proposed not to bind to fibrillar collagens. However, when osteosarcoma cells were cultured on reconstituted type I collagen fibrils, both decorin and biglycan were retained by the matrix. Immunogold labeling at the electron microscopic level showed that both proteoglycans were distributed along collagen fibrils not only in osteosarcoma cell-populated collagen lattices but also in human skin. Reconstituted type I collagen fibrils were able to bind in vitro native and N-glycan-free biglycan as well as recombinant biglycan core protein. From Scatchard plots dissociation, constants were obtained that were higher for glycanated biglycan (8.7 × 10-8 mol/liter) than for glycanated decorin (7 × 10-10 mol/liter and 3 × 10-9 mol/liter, respectively). A similar number of binding sites for either proteoglycan was calculated. Recombinant biglycan and decorin were characterized by lower dissociation constants compared with the glycanated forms. Glycanated as well as recombinant decorin competed with glycanated biglycan for collagen binding, suggesting that identical or adjacent binding sites on the fibril are used by both proteoglycans. These data suggest that, because of its trivalency, biglycan could have a special organizing function on the assembly of the extracellular matrix.

These data suggest that, because of its trivalency, biglycan could have a special organizing function on the assembly of the extracellular matrix. In the extracellular matrix, large aggregating proteoglycans as well as small, non-aggregating proteoglycans are found. Members of the former family, for example aggrecan and versican, provide the tissues with resistance to compressive forces. Members of the latter family, for example decorin and biglycan, are multifunctional proteoglycans that interact with other matrix macromolecules and regulate their functions (see (1Kjellén L.

Decorin carries one (and biglycan most often two) glycosaminoglycan chains. Their core proteins are characterized by N-terminally located glycosaminoglycan attachment sites followed by a cysteine-rich region, several leucine-rich repeats, and a C-terminally located conserved disulfide loop(4Krusius T.

Homologous core proteins are found in the keratan sulfate proteins lumican (7Blochberger T.C. Vergnes J.-P. Hempel J. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 347-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fibromodulin(8Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The specific association of decorin with fibrillar collagen has been shown by immunostaining at the electron microscopic level (9Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Fleischmajer R. Fisher L.W. MacDonald E.D. Jacobs Jr., L. Perlish J.S. Termine J.D. J. Struct.

While the dermatan sulfate chain plays only a minor role in this interaction(14Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the importance of the core protein for binding has convincingly been demonstrated(12Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 13Vogel K.G. Koob T.J. Fisher L.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and a binding domain has been assigned to its C-terminal part(15Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Pogany G. Vogel K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At the electron microscopic level, decorin appeared regularly arrayed at or near the d- and e-bands in the gap zone of type I collagen fibrils(9Pringle G.A. Dodd C.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Scott J.E. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 165-181Google Scholar, 18Scott J.E. Haigh M. Biosci. Rep. 1985; 5: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Lumican and fibromodulin are also interacting with fibrillar collagens, but their binding sites are different from the one occupied by decorin(14Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Scott J.E. Haigh M. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the binding of decorin to the surface of collagen fibrils, the lateral assembly of triple helical collagen molecules is delayed(12Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 20Rosenberg L. Tang L.H. Choi H.U. Johnson T. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 225-239Google Scholar), and the final diameter of the collagen fibrils becomes thinner(21Vogel K.G. Trotter J.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction between decorin and type I collagen has recently been questioned(22Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a solid phase binding assay, decorin interacted efficiently only with type VI and not with type I collagen. Immunoelectron microscopy of several tissues(23Linsenmayer T.F. Bruns R.R. Mentzer A. Mayne R. Dev. Biol. 1986; 118: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Keene D.R. Engvall E. Glanville R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1995-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) suggests the participation of type VI collagen mainly in distinct microfibrillar and “beaded filament” structures deposited between collagen fibrils. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that type VI collagen acts as linking moiety between type I collagen and decorin. Tight association of decorin with type VI collagen was found in rabbit cornea(25Takahashi T. Cho H.-I. Kublin C.L. Cintron C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and immunolocalization studies indicated the presence of biglycan in non-mesenchymal tissues where decorin had not been found(26Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Gehron Robey P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, biglycan was also detected in connective tissues, e.g. in dermis, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels(5Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Gehron Robey P. J. Histochem.

J. 1993; 290: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It exhibited a predominantly pericellular location and was considered to play a role in growth control(28Fedarko N.S. Vetter U.K. Weinstein S. Gehron Robey P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Despite the homology of the core protein of biglycan with the collagen-binding family members decorin, fibromodulin, and lumican, its co-localization with dermal collagen fibrils could not be detected by immunocytochemistry at the electronmicroscopic level(10Fleischmajer R. Fisher L.W. MacDonald E.D. Jacobs Jr., L. Perlish J.S. Termine J.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Likewise, biglycan did not show a specific effect on collagen fibril formation in vitro(29Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, however, evidence for an interaction between biglycan and fibrillar collagen will be provided, thus adding this proteoglycan to the list of connective tissue-organizing macromolecules. The human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Rabbit antisera against biglycan, decorin, and proteoglycan-100 were those previously used(30Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt B. Kresse H. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An antiserum against human fibromodulin was kindly provided by Dr. Anna Plaas (Shriners Hospital, Tampa, FL). There was no cross-reactivity between the different antisera. A mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained after immunization with pepsin-solubilized bovine type VI collagen. For immunocytochemistry of biglycan and decorin, affinity-purified antisera were used. Type I collagen was prepared from calf skin by pepsin digestion. Further purification for the removal of types III and V collagen was performed by sequential NaCl precipitation at acid and neutral pH, respectively(31Fujii T. Kühn K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1975; 356: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Jacalin-agarose was from Sigma, and collagenase was from Advance Biofactures (Lynbrook, NY). Decorin was prepared from the secretions of human skin fibroblasts after labeling with [35S]sulfate for 72 h or with [35S]methionine for 16 h(30Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt B. Kresse H. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, as described(32Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Due to the low expression of biglycan in cultured skin fibroblasts, at the most 5% of the total radioactivity in the final preparation was represented by this proteoglycan. For the preparation of radioactively labeled biglycan, MG-63 cells were similarly incubated with 35S-labeled metabolic precursors. Labeling was also performed in the presence of tunicamycin (0.2 μg/ml) after preincubating the cultures for 16 h with the same inhibitor concentration. Secreted proteoglycans were obtained by chromatography on DEAE-Trisacryl M as described(32Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that 6 M urea was included in the starting buffer. The ion exchange column (0.8 × 6 cm) was then washed with 10 ml of 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 M NaCl, 6 M urea, and protease inhibitors followed by 10 ml of the same solution without urea. Small proteoglycans were desorbed with 1 M NaCl in urea-free buffer. For the removal of proteoglycan-100, which is a major contaminant in these preparations (33Schwarz K. Breuer B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the eluate of the DEAE column was directly applied to a 0.8 × 6-cm column of jacalin-agarose and equilibrated and eluted with 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 M NaCl. Biglycan and decorin are not retained by the lectin. Decorin was removed by immune reaction with a monospecific antiserum against deglycosylated human decorin, using immune globulins that had been immobilized on protein A-Sepharose. Employing 9 mg of protein A-Sepharose for the treatment of the secretions from a 75-cm2 culture flask yielded preparations where at the most 2% of the radioactivity was represented by decorin. Acid-soluble type I collagen was dissolved in 17 mM acetic acid (4.4 mg/ml), neutralized by adding PBS ( 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salinePG-100proteoglycan-100. )(140 mM NaCl in 18 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The fibrils formed were collected, suspended in 300 μl of PBS/mg of collagen, and dispersed by ultrasonication. The incubation mixture contained (in a final volume of 600 μl) 0.17 mg of collagen and radioactively labeled ligand in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Controls were incubated without collagen. After 5 h at 37°C under constant mixing, the pellet was washed with PBS, and bound and free radioactive ligands were quantitated. Proteins remaining in the supernatant were precipitated by addition of 1 volume of chloroform and 3 volumes of methanol, digested with chondroitin ABC lyase(34Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. phosphate-buffered saline proteoglycan-100. Plasmid P16 containing a full-length human biglycan cDNA sequence (5Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. L. Fisher (NIDR, National Institutes of Health). Clone D6 containing the coding region of human decorin core protein has been previously described(35Beavan L.A. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schönherr E. Snigula F. Leroy J.G. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9856-9862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the biglycan cDNA, a HindIII fragment (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was generated that contained the information for amino acids 4-343 of the secreted form of the core protein. The fragment was cloned into the BamHI restriction site of pRSET A (Invitrogen) and expressed as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant proteins were extracted with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose spin column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with 8 M urea and 0.5 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 (buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A until the A280 was below 0.01. Further washings were with 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma) in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5 (buffer B). Elution was achieved by applying 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80 in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 4.0. Appropriate fractions were diluted with buffer B to an A280 of about 0.03, made 0.05% with bovine serum albumin, and dialyzed for 48 h at 4°C against 20 times the sample volume of 1 M urea, 2 mM glutathione (reduced), 0.005% Tween 80 in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. After dialysis overnight against 0.2 × PBS, insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation, and 1.5-ml aliquots of the supernatant were lyophilized and reconstituted with 300 μl of H2O by brief sonication. For the expression of recombinant decorin core protein, a BstUI-EcoRI fragment was prepared, which carried the information for amino acids 15-329 of the mature protein. It was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI restriction site of pRSET A. All further steps were precisely as described above. For the preparation of radioactively labeled proteins, M9 minimal medium was used, which was substituted with amino acids (except methionine and cysteine) and with thiamine. MgSO4 was replaced by MgCl2. Induced cultures (A600 about 0.5) were then incubated for 3 h in the presence of 0.37 MBq/ml of [35S]sulfate, and the same amount of radiosulfate was added after the first 1.5 h of incubation. The purification procedures were as described above. Human skin fibroblasts and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells were maintained in monolayer culture and embedded in type I collagen lattices exactly as described before(11Greve H. Blumberg P. Schmidt G. Schlumberger W. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In some experiments, metabolic labeling with [35S]sulfate (final radioactivity, 0.74 MBq/ml) started at the time of the preparation of cell-populated collagen lattices, and the media components were supplemented with the radioactive precursor accordingly. In other experiments, type I collagen fibrils (0.67 mg) were suspended in 200 μl of medium, and 5-μl aliquots were dotted on coverslips. 30 min later, MG-63 cells were transferred to the coverslips and maintained in culture for 1 day. Immunostaining for biglycan and decorin was performed as described(27Schönherr E. Beavan L.A. Hausser H. Kresse H. Culp L.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Staining for PG-100 and fibromodulin was performed analogously. For immunocytochemistry at the electron microscopic level, collagen lattices were pre-fixed and incubated under sterile conditions with affinity-purified antibodies against decorin (17 μg of protein/ml of PBS) and biglycan (20 μg of protein/ml), respectively, or with monoclonal anti-type VI collagen antibodies (30 μg/ml) followed by incubation with either gold-labeled protein A (12 nm) or gold-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (6 nm) as described(11Greve H. Blumberg P. Schmidt G. Schlumberger W. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lattice samples were then washed, fixed with Karnovsky's reagent, post-fixed with OsO4, and embedded in Epon 812(41Miosge N. Flachsbart K. Goetz W. Schultz W. Kresse H. Herken R. Histochem. J. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For immunocytochemistry of skin, a biopsy was taken from the upper arm of a 7-year-old boy and immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Ultrathin sections were processed and embedded in Lowicryl K4M as described(38Völker W. Frick B. Robenek H. J. Microsc. (OxF.). 1985; 138: 91-95Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical labeling was performed by floating formavar-coated nickel grids, section side down, on 20-μl droplets of 10 mM NH4Cl, affinity-purified antibody, diluted 1:50 in PBS and protein A-gold. The specificity of the immunolabeling was tested by omitting the primary antibody and by using non-immune serum or “unspecific” IgG instead. Further processing was as described above. For biochemical analysis of proteoglycans retained in the collagen lattice, the lattices were incubated with 50 bovine tendon collagen units of collagenase in 100 μl of 25 mM Tris/HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2 containing additionally 10 mM CaCl2 for 15 min at 45°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed with 100 μl of enzyme-free buffer. Both supernatants were combined and subjected to immune precipitations. Neither biglycan nor decorin core proteins were degraded by the enzyme. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (39Svoboda M. Meuris S. Robyn C. Christophe J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were performed as described (30Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt B. Kresse H. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the quantification of recombinant proteins, standards (bovine serum albumin, 1-30 μg) and samples were electrophoresed on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were stained with 0.1% (w/v) amido black 10B in methanol/acetic acid/H2O (9:2:9 by volume) and destained in methanol/acetic acid/H2O (45:1:4, by volume). Stained bands were cut out and eluted with 300 μl of 25 mM NaOH, 0.04 mM EDTA in 50% aqueous ethanol before the absorbance at 630 nm was determined. Under our tissue culture conditions, normal skin fibroblasts produce only very small quantities of biglycan. To study the interaction between biglycan and collagen, MG-63 osteosarcoma cells were used, which usually synthesize more biglycan than decorin. These cells, like fibroblasts, are able to retract collagen gels albeit at somewhat slower velocity. After 4 days of culture in collagen lattices, biglycan was the predominant small proteoglycan retained in gels populated by MG-63 cells, whereas decorin was retained in fibroblast cultures (Fig. 1). The retention of biglycan was not due to its higher molecular weight compared with decorin because PG-100, which is similar in size to biglycan and which does not bind to collagen(33Schwarz K. Breuer B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was predominantly released into the medium, and only minor quantities were retained in the lattice (Fig. 2). Further experiments demonstrated that the collagenous matrix was required for the retention of biglycan. MG-63 cells were maintained on coverslips on which distinct spots had been coated with reconstituted collagen fibrils. Immunostaining for biglycan, decorin, and fibromodulin indicated that these proteoglycans were associated with the fibrillar matrix and with the cells themselves. PG-100 was observed exclusively in association with the cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3Immunostaining of MG-63 cells plated on top of reconstituted collagen type I fibrils with monospecific antisera for small proteoglycans. In vitro reconstituted type I fibrils were bound to some areas of coverslips, and MG-63 cells were grown for 24 h on these slips. Fixed cells were stained with Coomassie Blue (A) to demonstrate the presence and absence of coated proteins. Immunostainings were performed with the preimmune serum for biglycan (B, 500-fold dilution) and with antisera for biglycan (C, 500-fold dilution), decorin (D, 500-fold dilution), PG-100 (E, 100-fold dilution), and fibromodulin (F, 500-fold dilution), respectively.

Immunoelectron microscopy was therefore used to study the localization of small proteoglycans along collagen fibrils. It is shown in Fig. 4 that after 2 days of culture, the cells had produced sufficient quantities of biglycan and decorin to show their association with fibrils. Because of the reported high affinity binding of decorin to type VI collagen, we also tested for the presence of this collagen type. Though the most prominent staining for type VI collagen was present on non-fibrillar extracellular material (not shown), we also found type VI-specific staining associated with collagen fibrils (Fig. 4C). Thus, the formation of a sandwich between types I and VI collagen and the small proteoglycans cannot be excluded, but it may also be possible that type VI collagen is bound by fibril-associated proteoglycans. Immunostaining experiments using cell-populated collagen lattices suffer from the inherent drawback that the antigens under investigation have to be synthesized within the short experimental period. Immunoelectron microscopy of human dermis was therefore used to study the localization of biglycan and decorin under the condition of a metabolic equilibrium. Fig. 5 indicates that both biglycan and decorin could be found in association with fibrillar collagen. Excessive quantities of decorin did not quench the positive staining for biglycan (Fig. 5C). To investigate the specificity of [35S]sulfate-labeled biglycan for the binding to collagen fibrils, highly purified type I collagen was used for fibril reconstitution. In a Scatchard plot, a straight line was obtained (Fig. 6A). From the known specific radioactivity (17 × 104 cpm/μmol uronic acid) and the previously determined composition of biglycan (160 uronic acid residues/molecule) (33Schwarz K. Breuer B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a Kd value of 8.7 × 10-8 mol/liter was calculated. This value is very close to the Kd value of 3 × 10-8 mol/liter reported for the interaction of decorin from bovine tendon with type I collagen(40Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Using 300 kDa as relative molecular mass of collagen, the number of biglycan binding sites per collagen molecule was estimated to be 0.046. This value, too, is similar to 0.054 binding sites per molecule previously calculated for decorin(40Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, decorin obtained from fibroblast secretions appeared to interact with reconstituted type I collagen fibrils with greater affinity than the proteoglycan from tendon (Fig. 6B). For a high affinity site, a Kd value of about 7 × 10-10 mol/liter was calculated. The interaction with a second site, which accommodates the majority of ligand molecules, could be characterized by a Kd value of 3 × 10-9 mol/liter. Using higher doses of decorin (up to 7 nmol per assay) additional binding could be detected (data not shown), and a Kd value of 2 × 10-6 mol/liter and a total of 0.043 binding sites per collagen molecule were calculated. Shortage of material prevented a search for low affinity biglycan binding sites. The interaction between type I collagen and biglycan was independent of the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides of the core protein. [35S]Methionine-labeled biglycan was prepared from the secretions of MG-63 cells treated with tunicamycin. It is evident from Fig. 7 that N-glycan-free biglycan bound at least as well as the fully glycanated form of the proteoglycan. In an independent approach to study small proteoglycan binding, [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled fusion proteins of biglycan and decorin were expressed in Escherichia coli. Renatured proteins were used in binding assays. It is shown in Fig. 8 that both proteins were able to interact with type I collagen fibrils. The Scatchard plots obtained indicated that the carbohydrate-free biglycan exhibited with 5 × 10-11 mol/liter (3 × 10-11 mol/liter in a separate experiment), a much smaller Kd value than the native proteoglycan (Fig. 9). The Kd for decorin was with 3 × 10-10 mol/liter similar to the high affinity value obtained for glycanated decorin.Figure 9Scatchard plots of the interaction of recombinant biglycan (A) and recombinant decorin (B), respectively, to reconstituted type I collagen fibrils. One of three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The availability of recombinant proteins made it possible to investigate whether or not identical binding sites on collagen were occupied by both core proteins. Recombinant biglycan as well as recombinant and native decorin were able to inhibit the binding of native biglycan to type I collagen (Table 1). This conclusion was corroborated in two further experiments using different preparations of recombinant core proteins.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab This communication provides evidence for an interaction of biglycan with reconstituted collagen fibrils by showing that biglycan associates with the fibrils in cell-populated collagen lattices and by the demonstration that native as well as recombinant biglycan bind to purified type I collagen fibrils. These in vitro observations are strengthened by the finding of a co-localization of biglycan and fibrillar collagen in human dermis. Furthermore, in a recent study, collagen fibrils of human articular cartilage were found to be decorated with biglycan as well as with decorin(41Miosge N. Flachsbart K. Goetz W. Schultz W. Kresse H. Herken R. Histochem. J. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), thus supporting the potential relevance of the biglycan-collagen interaction under in vivo conditions. Previous studies had shown that chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteins occupied d- or e-bands in the gap zone of collagen fibrils, whereas a- or c-bands were the locations of keratan sulfate proteins(19Scott J.E. Haigh M. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fibromodulin is located at a different site than decorin(14Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The competition experiments performed in this study allow the conclusion that decorin and biglycan either use the same site along the fibril or that steric hindrance occurs when one of two adjacent binding sites is occupied. With regard to decorin-collagen interaction, Scott (17Scott J.E. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press, London1993: 165-181Google Scholar, 42Scott J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) has proposed a model where the glycosaminoglycan chains of fibril-bound decorin form antiparallel duplexes with each other, thereby regulating the distance between adjacent fibrils. An analogous binding of biglycan and collagen adds a further dimension to this model since the two glycosaminoglycan chains of biglycan could form bridges to two separate collagen fibrils. It could easily be envisaged that biglycan as a trivalent ligand contributes even more substantially than the bivalent decorin to the organization of a collagenous matrix. A further aspect of the potential biological importance of the interaction between type I collagen and biglycan can be deduced from the findings that osteoblasts and MG-63 cells respond to treatment with transforming growth factor β with an induction of type I collagen and biglycan biosynthesis(43Wrana J.F. Maeno M. Hawrylyshyn B. Yao K.-L. Domenicucci D. Sodek J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 44Breuer B. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Biglycan and decorin were both found to bind and potentially to inactivate this cytokine(2Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). An increase of transforming growth factor β, e.g. after bone injury, could, therefore, initiate a self-regulatory circuit of extracellular matrix production and growth factor activity. This circuit would depend on the interaction of biglycan and type I collagen since decorin becomes down-regulated upon transforming growth factor β treatment (44Breuer B. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In light of the present results, it seems surprising that until very recently previous attempts failed to demonstrate the association of biglycan with collagen. A negative immunostaining result(11Greve H. Blumberg P. Schmidt G. Schlumberger W. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), however, could be explained by the assumption that the reactive epitope(s) of the biglycan core protein became masked by the interaction with matrix molecules. In a very recent study(45Riessen R. Isner J.M. Blessing E. Loushin C. Nikol S. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 962-974PubMed Google Scholar), it was found indeed that on a light microscopic level, biglycan staining co-localized with intense collagen type I and III staining in atherosclerotic lesions. The failure of observing biglycan-collagen interactions under in vitro conditions (29Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is more difficult to explain. It seems reasonable to assume that even subtle changes in the tertiary structure of the core protein and/or differences in the composition of the glycosaminoglycan chains and the asparagine-bound oligosaccharides may influence the binding properties. Our purification procedure for intact biglycan avoided the use of guanidine hydrochloride, a strong denaturing agent. On the other hand, recombinant core proteins could successfully be renatured, as indicated, for example, also by the strong competition of recombinant decorin for endocytosis of glycanated decorin by fibroblasts. ( 2H. Hausser, E. Schönherr, and H. Kresse, unpublished result. ) Though biglycan was detected on the surface of fibrils in cell-populated collagen lattices, the apparent Kd value for biglycan was 2 orders of magnitude higher than the respective value for decorin, the data being calculated on the basis of in vitro studies with reconstituted type I collagen fibrils. As the core proteins of both proteoglycans have a basic isoelectric point(4Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 5Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems possible that in case of a biglycanated core protein there is a greater chance than in case of a monoglycanated one that the collagen binding site becomes inaccessible, due to interactions with acidic glycosaminoglycan chains. The data could indicate that the stability of biglycan collagen complexes is also lower in vivo than the stability of decorin collagen complexes. However, Scatchard plots with reconstituted fibrils should be interpreted cautiously since in tissues, mixed fibrils of tightly regulated diameter are present(46Henkel W. Glanville R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 47Fessler J.H. Fessler L.I. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 81-103Google Scholar), which may behave differently with respect to proteoglycan binding. An unexpected result was the finding of the very low dissociation constant for the complex between recombinant biglycan and collagen fibrils. In interpreting this Kd value, the observation should be considered that biglycan appears to be capable of self-association(48Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which also seems to be relevant under physiological ionic conditions(30Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt B. Kresse H. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If self-association occurs preferentially on surfaces, the quantity of fibril-bound biglycan would have been selectively overestimated. This aspect of the study deserves further attention. In summary, our data provide evidence for an interaction between biglycan and fibrillar collagen, which can be found in vitro and in vivo. This conclusion is not at variance with previous proposals that biglycan may play a role in the regulation of cell behavior (26Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Gehron Robey P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) but adds a further aspect to the potential functions of the proteoglycan with respect to matrix assembly and growth factor binding.

https://openalex.org/W2049815423,"The Ras-binding domain (RBD) of human Raf-1 was purified from Escherichia coli, and its interaction with Ras was investigated. Its dissociation constant with p21ras•guanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate was found to be 18 nM, with a slight preference for H-ras over K- and N-ras. Oncogenic forms bind with slightly lower affinity. The affinity of RBD for effector region mutants or the GDP-bound form of p21ras is in the micromolar range, which means that 100-fold lower affinity is not sufficient for signal transduction. The rate of the GTPase of p21ras is not modified by RBD. Since Pi release is found not to be rate limiting, the Ras-Raf signal of the cell may be terminated by the intrinsic GTPase of p21ras."

We hypothesize that other critical regulators of apoptosis must be subject to dephosphorylation. INTRODUCTIONApoptosis is a form of cell death defined by morphological criteria(1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 2Eastman A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 121: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The earliest event observed in a cell undergoing apoptosis is chromatin condensation at the nuclear membrane, whereas other organelles remain intact. This is generally followed by nuclear fragmentation, cell surface blebbing and cell shrinkage. Loss of membrane integrity is a late event. These changes occur as a consequence of many initiating stimuli such as glucocorticoid-mediated killing of thymocytes(3Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar), growth factor withdrawal(4Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Lymphokine Res. 1986; 5: 289-299PubMed Google Scholar), and cytotoxic T-cell killing(5Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, a wide variety of cytotoxic agents induce apoptosis(6Barry M.A. Behnke C.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 2353-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 7Eastman A. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar).Much interest in apoptosis has been generated by the observation that genes such as bcl-2 can prevent cells from dying(8Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). There are now many genes and drugs that can either cause or prevent apoptosis, but there is little understanding of the pathways that induce this form of cell death. Accordingly, there is no framework for understanding how any gene or drug modulates the eventual cell death. The current experiments were designed to address this important gap in our understanding.The origin of the chromatin condensation and therefore an initiating event in apoptosis is thought to be DNA fragmentation. Usually, this fragmentation arises from internucleosomal digestion of genomic DNA (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Several reports that apoptosis occurs without such DNA digestion can be explained by the finding that DNA breaks at >50-kilobase pair frequency are sufficient to induce the morphological changes of apoptosis(9Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C. Morris I.D. Hickman J.A. Wakeling A.E. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 10Brown D.G. Sun X.-M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3037-3039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the signal transduction pathways leading to apoptosis, we have attempted to identify an endonuclease that produces the DNA digestion, so that we can subsequently understand the upstream events that regulate its activation.Mammalian cells contain a variety of endonucleases any of which could be involved in apoptosis(11Eastman A. Barry M.A. Cancer Invest. 1992; 10: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). A Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease has frequently been implicated in apoptosis, but many cells appear to lack this endonuclease or lack the increase in Ca2+ required to activate it. Even former proponents of a Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease have recently suggested that Ca2+ may be involved in a signal transduction pathway rather than as a direct activator of the endonuclease(12Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Hanson K. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our laboratory identified an alternate endonuclease, deoxyribonuclease II, that was activated by decreased intracellular pH with no requirement for Ca2+(13Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In human HL-60 cells, apoptosis can be induced rapidly by many drugs. Using the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, we established that apoptotic cells underwent selective inhibition of pH regulation leading to a 0.8 pH unit acidification with no change in intracellular Ca2+(14Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were sorted on a flow cytometer, and only the acidic cells had the morphology and DNA digestion of apoptosis. These results were consistent with apoptosis resulting from intracellular acidification.The current experiments were designed to investigate whether intracellular acidification was more generally associated with the induction of apoptosis. We have therefore extended our studies to a common physiological model of apoptosis; specifically, a system in which apoptosis is induced by removal of a growth factor. We report on an IL-2( 1The abbreviations used are: IL-2interleukin-2AMacetoxymethyl esterEIPAethylisopropylamiloridepHeextracellular pHpHiintracellular pHTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. )-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line CTLL-2 and establish that intracellular acidification, but not increased Ca2+, also correlates with apoptosis in this model. We further demonstrate that the acidification can be explained by alteration in the set-point of the Na+/H+-antiport. However, we also show that an acidic pH is not required for apoptosis. This has led to a hypothesis that may explain the regulation of apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHoechst 33342 and the acetoxymethyl esters of carboxyl-SNARF-1, indo-1, and EGTA were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell culture supplies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.Cell CultureIL-2-dependent murine cytotoxic T-lymphocyte CTLL-2 cells (15Baker P.E. Gillis S. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) were maintained at a density of 0.1-2.0 × 105 cells/ml. The cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated (56°C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, 90 pM recombinant IL-2, 100 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 25 mM HEPES, 30 mM NaHCO3, 0.12 μM Na2SeO4, and 0.1 mM cystine HCl at pH 7.4. In several experiments, cells were incubated in medium at various pH. This was achieved by making complete medium at either pH 8.0 with 50 mM HEPES or 5.5 with 50 mM Mes. These media were mixed to obtain the required final pH. Sodium bicarbonate was added to 20 mM as required. The pH values were always measured after mixing, as well as at the end of the experiment to confirm that no drift had occurred.DNA DigestionDNA digestion in cells was measured by electrophoresis as described previously(13Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 16Eastman A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells are lysed directly in the wells of the gel and high molecular weight genomic DNA remains trapped in or near the well. Smaller fragments down to 180 base pairs are resolved in the gel. DNA is visualized with ethidium bromide.Flow CytometryCell cycle analysis was performed on cells fixed in ethanol and stained with propidium iodide as described previously(17Sorenson C.M. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4484-4488PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular pH (pHi) and Ca2+ were measured as described previously(14Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 16Eastman A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For pHi measurements, cells were loaded for 1 h with 2 μM carboxyl-SNARF-1 AM and analyzed on a flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission measured at 585 and 640 nm. For Ca2+ measurements, cells were loaded with 1 μM indo-1 AM and analyzed on a flow cytometer with excitation at 355 nm and emission measured at 405 and 485 nm. For both measurements, cells were maintained at 37°C in complete medium, including bicarbonate during analysis unless otherwise noted. Quantitation of the number of cells in various populations was obtained by drawing regions on the profiles and excluding cells with fluorescence <50 to avoid cells that either do not load with dye or that have lost membrane integrity. The pHi and Ca2+ measurements were obtained by ratioing the fluorescence emissions at the two appropriate wavelengths and generating a pH calibration curve or using a Ca2+ dissociation equation(18June C.H. Rabinovitch P.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1990; 33: 37-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were also sorted based on these ratios and collected into separate tubes on ice and analyzed for DNA digestion.As an additional assay for apoptosis, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 5 min and analyzed on a flow cytometer with excitation at 355 nm and emission measured at 440 nm. This assay detects an increased rate of accumulation of Hoechst 33342 into apoptotic cells which is thought to be due to very early changes in membrane permeability(19Ormerod M.G. Sun X.-M. Snowden R.T. Davies R. Fearnhead H. Cohen G.M. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). pHi and Hoechst 33342 fluorescence were measured simultaneously by first incubating cells with carboxyl-SNARF-1 AM for 1 h in complete medium, then washing once and resuspending the cells in medium at defined pHe containing Hoechst 33342. As needed, the medium also contained 20 μM EIPA to inhibit the Na+/H+-antiport. Analysis was performed after 5 min, a time shown in initial experiments to equilibrate the pHi, and results were displayed as a two-dimensional contour plot of 585/640 ratio for pH versus Hoechst 33342 fluorescence.RESULTSDNA Digestion and ApoptosisCytotoxic T lymphocyte CTLL-2 cells require IL-2 for survival and proliferation. Upon removal of IL-2, these cells degrade their DNA in a manner characteristic of apoptosis. To determine the kinetics of appearance of DNA digestion, cells were harvested at various times after removal of IL-2, and the DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis for the appearance of 180-base pair DNA fragments (Fig. 1A). In the presence of IL-2, no digested DNA was observed. Following removal of IL-2, DNA digestion was significantly above background at 12 h, reaching a maximum around 16 h.The cell cycle phase dependence of apoptosis following removal of IL-2 was assessed. Cells were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). By 4 h following removal of IL-2, cells began to accumulate in the G1 phase, and by 8 h, most of the cells had exited the S phase. At 16 h, the time at which DNA digestion appeared maximum, most of the cells remained arrested in the G1 phase. Not until 20 h did a significant number of cells begin to appear in the sub-G1 population as is frequently observed in apoptotic cells. However, these sub-G1 cells rapidly disintegrate into many fragments, so quantitation of this population is not possible. Up to the time that the cells disintegrate, they also exclude trypan blue. These results show that DNA digestion occurs several hours before loss of membrane integrity and cell disintegration.Figure 2:Cell cycle analysis of CTLL-2 cells following withdrawal of IL-2. Relative DNA content was assessed by fixing cells, staining with propidium iodide, and analyzing by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intracellular pHWe have previously observed intracellular acidification in human HL-60 and ML-1 cells following incubation with etoposide(14Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 20Morana S. Li J. Springer E.W. Eastman A. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 153-158PubMed Google Scholar). For those studies, we adapted the flow cytometer to measure pHi which facilitated detection of large pH shifts in individual cells as opposed to only small shifts observed when the average of a total population was measured in a spectrofluorimeter. CTLL-2 cells were loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, carboxyl-SNARF-1, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The data are displayed in a two-dimensional scatter plot according to the fluorescent intensities at two emission wavelengths (Fig. 3). The cells exhibit a large variation in loading of the fluorescent dye, but in a control population, all the cells lie close to a single line extending outward from the origin. By comparison with a standard curve, the mean pHi in these cells was 7.4 when the pHe was 7.40. Cells to the right of this line would be more acidic, whereas cells to the left would be more alkaline.Figure 3:Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular pH changes in individual CTLL-2 cells following withdrawal of IL-2. At the indicated times following withdrawal of IL-2, cells were loaded with carboxyl-SNARF-1, then analyzed by flow cytometry, and displayed as a two-dimensional scatter plot according to the fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths of 585 and 640 nm. Quantitation was performed by drawing regions around each population excluding the cells with fluorescence <50 and presenting the results as histograms: A, cells with normal pH; B, acidic cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Twelve hours following removal of IL-2, a second population of cells began to appear to the right of the control population. As previously seen with HL-60 and ML-1 cells(14Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 20Morana S. Li J. Springer E.W. Eastman A. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 153-158PubMed Google Scholar), this population was not a continuum of cells with decreasing pHi, but rather a distinct population with a more acidic pHi. The mean pHi of this acidic population was 6.7. The fluorescence intensity of the acidic cells was lower than the normal cells, suggesting that the acidic cells have a reduced uptake or increased efflux of carboxyl SNARF-1. However, the measurement of pHi is independent of the intracellular dye concentration as it is the ratio of fluorescence emissions that is used to calculate pH. Quantitation of the number of cells in each population was obtained by drawing regions around these cells; these values are presented as histograms in Fig. 3.The number of acidic cells increased throughout the experiment with concomitant decrease in the control population. At 12 h, approximately 7% of the cells were in the acidic population. The number of acidic cells increased to 20, 30, and 48% at 16, 20, and 24 h, respectively. The time of acidification correlated closely with the time of the DNA digestion and occurred prior to fragmentation of the cells or loss of membrane integrity as assayed by trypan blue.Intracellular Ca2+The flow cytometer was also used to investigate whether increased intracellular Ca2+ occurred following withdrawal of IL-2 (Fig. 4). The intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the control cells was about 90 nM when the cells were incubated in normal medium with an extracellular Ca2+ concentration of 1.8 mM. At 16 h following removal of IL-2, about 12% of the cells had shifted to the right which represents an increased intracellular Ca2+. This number increased to 44% by 24 h. Unlike the pH shift in which a second population was observed, these cells showed a heterogeneous increase. Of the cells with increased Ca2+, the average Ca2+ concentration was 600 nM, whereas the maximum was around 1 μM.Figure 4:Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular Ca2+ changes in individual CTLL-2 cells following withdrawal of IL-2. At the indicated times following withdrawal of IL-2, cells were loaded with indo-1, then analyzed by flow cytometry, and displayed as a two-dimensional scatter plot according to the fluorescence intensities at emission wavelengths of 405 and 485 nm.

Cells were analyzed 16 h after removal of IL-2. The cells were separated into the 40% most acidic and 40% most alkaline or those with the 40% highest and 40% lowest intracellular Ca2+. Cells were collected directly on to ice and then analyzed for DNA digestion (Fig. 1B). Almost all of the DNA digestion was observed in the acidic cells as well as in the cells with high Ca2+. This demonstrated that the acidified cells were also those with increased Ca2+, so it did not resolve the question as to which of these signals might be associated with DNA digestion.Modulation of Intracellular pH and Ca2+CTLL-2 cells were incubated with the Ca2+ chelator EGTA to determine whether this would block the intracellular Ca2+ increase and suppress DNA digestion following removal of IL-2. Incubation of CTLL-2 cells in the presence of IL-2 and 5 mM EGTA for 16 h caused a slight shift to the left in the two-dimensional dot plot consistent with a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ to near zero (Fig. 5). Following removal of IL-2 for 16 h, 26% of the cells shifted to the high Ca2+ region, but this increase was completely inhibited by the presence of EGTA. Incubation of cells with the acetoxymethyl ester form of EGTA to chelate intracellular Ca2+ was unable to prevent the increase in Ca2+, suggesting that the source of Ca2+ was the extracellular medium. Parallel samples were also analyzed for changes in intracellular pH (Fig. 6). Following removal of IL-2, about 30% of the cells underwent intracellular acidification, but the addition of EGTA did not reduce this number. When the cellular DNA was analyzed following removal of IL-2, DNA digestion still occurred in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that intracellular acidification rather than increases in Ca2+ correlated with DNA digestion.Figure 5:Modulation of intracellular Ca2+ by EGTA and ionomycin in CTLL-2 cells following withdrawal of IL-2.

Similarly, calcium ionophores can cause either intracellular acidification or alkalinization(22Barry M.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 1985; 313: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated the effect of ionomycin on intracellular pH and Ca2+, as well as on DNA digestion. Ionomycin (1 μM) in the presence of IL-2 increased intracellular Ca2+ in the majority of cells to 400 nM, and after removal of IL-2, a subpopulation was observed with even higher Ca2+ (Fig. 5). In contrast, ionomycin inhibited intracellular acidification following removal of IL-2 (Fig. 6). Ionomycin appeared to decrease the carboxyl-SNARF-1 fluorescence in many cells, but there was clearly no cells in the acidic population. Ionomycin also markedly inhibited DNA digestion (Fig. 1C). These results confirm that acidification rather than increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration correlates with apoptotic DNA digestion.Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters TPA can also protect cells from apoptosis(26McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Lopez-Rivas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The addition of 10 nM TPA to CTLL-2 cells at the time of removal of IL-2 inhibited both the acidification and DNA digestion up to at least 24 h (data not shown). These cells still accumulated in the G1 phase but produced no sub-G1 population of apoptotic cells. Intracellular pH could also be modulated by the readdition of IL-2 at any time point, which immediately prevented more cells from undergoing intracellular acidification as well as preventing further DNA digestion, although readdition of IL-2 could not reverse acidification (data not shown).pH RegulationThe origin of the intracellular acidification was investigated further. We previously hypothesized that the intracellular acidification was due to selective loss of pH regulation while maintaining an electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (14Barry M.A. Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2349-2357PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Accordingly, we determined which proton regulators were responsible for normal regulation of pH in these cells. CTLL-2 cells were acid loaded by transient exposure, then removal of ammonium chloride. The rate of pH recovery was then measured continuously on the flow cytometer (Fig. 7). The intracellular pH returned to 7.3 in about 10 min in bicarbonate-free medium, and this recovery could be inhibited by concurrent incubation with the Na+/H+-antiport inhibitor EIPA (20 μM). Parallel studies with the H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin (1 μM) had little effect on the rate of pH recovery. Hence, these cells appear to use primarily the Na+/H+-antiport to protect against intracellular acidification.Figure 7:Identification of proton transport mechanisms operating in CTLL-2 cells. Cells were loaded with carboxyl-SNARF-1 for 1 h, then analyzed continuously by flow cytometry in the absence of bicarbonate; the lines represent the mean pH of the cell population. Ammonium chloride (10 mM) was added to cells at the indicated time, then removed rapidly by centrifugation after 10 min followed by one wash. The first part of the curve is representative of the pHi changes that occur prior to the acid-loading step. Following acid loading, cells were allowed to recover either in control medium (Cont) or medium containing 1 μM bafilomycin (Baf) or 20 μM EIPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A more detailed analysis of the pH changes that occur in CTLL-2 cells was performed. Following the induction of apoptosis, cells were equilibrated for 5 min at different pHe and the pHi was measured (Fig. 8). During the final 5 min, the cells were also incubated with Hoechst 33342; this helps to discriminate the normal from apoptotic cells as the latter show enhanced Hoechst fluorescence. When pHe was between 7 and 7.9, the undamaged cells were able to maintain their pHi close to 7.4; at lower pHe, these cells still maintained their pHi above pHe. In contrast, the pHi in apoptotic cells was lower than pHe except under the most acidic conditions. If these apoptotic cells were completely unable to regulate pHi, then the line for pHi would be parallel to, but more acidic than the pHe by an amount dependent upon the electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane. However, the two lines were not parallel, rather they converged around pH 6.3. To determine whether the convergence of these two lines was due to the Na+/H+-antiport, cells were equilibrated in the presence of EIPA; under these conditions, the pHi dropped dramatically at acidic pHe. In contrast, incubation of control cells with EIPA for 5 min had no effect on the pHi because EIPA only prevents recovery from an acid load as occurs in the apoptotic cells, but does not itself cause acidification. Parallel experiments in the presence of bicarbonate had negligible effect on these profiles (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the apoptotic cells still possess a functional Na+/H+-antiport, but that its set-point has changed.Figure 8:The dependence of pHi on pHe in normal and apoptotic CTLL-2 cells. Fifteen hours after withdrawal of IL-2, cells were loaded with carboxyl-SNARF-1 for 1 h, then equilibrated in medium of various pHe containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and as required, 20 μM EIPA. After 5 min, pHi was measured by flow cytometry. A-F represent examples of the experimental results. Cells at pHe = 7.40 (A, C, E) or 6.45 ("

https://openalex.org/W1517497091,"We have used serum-deprived cultures of wild type and genetically modified PC12 cells to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which monosialoganglioside (GM1) rescues neuronal cells from apoptotic death elicited by withdrawal of trophic support. Our findings indicate that GM1-promoted survival can be mediated in part by the Trk NGF receptor as well as by TrkB, and potentially by tyrosine kinase receptors for additional neurotrophic growth factors. Experiments employing K-252a, an inhibitor of Trk kinases, and PC12 cells overexpressing a dominant inhibitory form of Trk both indicate that a portion of the survival-promoting activity of GM1 is evoked by receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. In consonance with this we find that GM1 stimulates Trk tyrosine autophosphorylation and Trk-associated protein kinase activity. These observations may provide a mechanism to account for the reported in vitro and in vivo trophic actions of GM1."

A burst of synthesis terminates after the addition of about 250 nucleotides, a length corresponding to that of newly synthesized poly(A) tails in vivo. Further elongation is slow.

Thus, the control mechanism truly measures the length of the poly(A) tail. The stimulatory action of PAB II is similar on long and short tails.

Long tails differ from short ones only in that they do not permit the simultaneous stimulation of poly(A) polymerase by CPSF and PAB II. Consequently, elongation of long tails is distributive.

The 3′-end of the poly(A) tail is not sequestered in the protein-RNA complex when the correct length has been reached. Neither ATP hydrolysis nor turnover of the polymerized AMP is involved in length control. The poly(A) tails found at the 3′-ends of nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs are added during RNA processing in the cell nucleus and are later shortened after the RNA has been transported into the cytoplasm. The poly(A) tail has at least two different functions: the initiation of translation and the regulation of mRNA breakdown (reviewed by Sachs (1990), Jackson and Standart(1990), Bachvarova(1992), Wickens(1992), Sachs(1993), and Sachs and Wahle(1993)). A role in the export of mRNA from the cell nucleus is also possible (Wickens and Stephenson, 1984; Eckner et al., 1991). Evidence for a role in translation initiation has been provided by genetic experiments in yeast (Sachs and Davis, 1989, 1990), studies on RNA introduced by electroporation into a number of different cell types (Gallie, 1991), in vitro translation experiments (Munroe and Jacobson, 1990), and microinjection of RNAs into oocytes (Galili et al., 1988; Vassalli et al., 1989; Paris and Richter, 1990; Sheets et al., 1994). The oocyte studies suggest that not only the presence or absence of a poly(A) tail is important but that its length can determine translational efficiency. Although this does not prove that tail length is also important for translation in other cells, regulated changes in poly(A) tail length have been described that are correlated with changes in translation in somatic cells (Robinson et al., 1988). Evidence for a role of the poly(A) tail in the regulation of mRNA degradation comes from the observation that deadenylation is the first and rate-limiting step in the breakdown of at least some unstable mRNAs both in mammals and in yeast (Wilson and Treisman, 1988; Shyu et al., 1991; Muhlrad and Parker, 1992; Decker and Parker, 1993; Muhlrad et al., 1994). Sequences in the 3′-untranslated region and the coding sequence can control the half-life of the mRNA by influencing the rate of deadenylation (Shyu et al., 1991; Muhlrad and Parker, 1992; Lowell et al., 1992). A control of the rate of deadenylation is useful only if the length of poly(A) initially added in the cell nucleus is also controlled. In mammalian cells, newly synthesized bulk poly(A) is approximately 200-250 nucleotides long (Brawerman, 1981). Individual mRNAs that have been examined, c-fos and several c-fos-β-globin chimeras, have initial poly(A) tails of 150-300 nucleotides (Schiavi et al., 1994). A limitation of poly(A) tail synthesis to approximately 200 nucleotides has been observed during in vitro polyadenylation in crude nuclear extracts (Sheets and Wickens, 1989). Nuclear polyadenylation is preceded by an endonucleolytic cleavage of the primary transcript at the site of poly(A) addition. In vitro, specific polyadenylation of a “precleaved” RNA already ending at the poly(A) site has been reconstituted from three proteins purified from mammalian tissue (reviewed by Wahle and Keller (1992) and Sachs and Wahle(1993)). Poly(A) polymerase, the enzyme that catalyzes polyadenylation, is devoid of any pronounced specificity with regard to the RNA substrate and is also almost inactive on its own (Wahle, 1991a). Two other proteins activate the enzyme. One of these is the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), ( 1The abbreviations used: CPSFcleavage and polyadenylation specificity factorAMPPNPadenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphateATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)BSAbovine serum albuminPAB IIpoly(A) binding protein IIntnucleotide(s). )which binds the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA that is present in almost every mRNA precursor (Bienroth et al., 1991; Keller et al., 1991; Murthy and Manley, 1992). The second stimulatory factor is a poly(A)-binding protein (PAB II), which binds the growing poly(A) tail (Wahle, 1991b; Wahle et al., 1993). Each of these two factors directs poly(A) polymerase specifically to RNAs carrying the respective protein binding site, either AAUAAA or an oligo(A) tail of at least 10 nucleotides. However, poly(A) polymerase works most efficiently when it is stimulated by both factors simultaneously (Wahle, 1991b). The enzyme on its own is entirely distributive. When held on the RNA by the combined efforts of CPSF and PAB II, the enzyme attains sufficient processivity to synthesize a complete poly(A) tail in one single binding event. Either stimulatory factor alone leads only to a very small increase in processivity (Bienroth et al., 1993). cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) bovine serum albumin poly(A) binding protein II nucleotide(s). The polyadenylation apparatus reconstituted as described above also reproduces the length control observed either in vivo or in extracts. Once a poly(A) tail length of close to 250 nucleotides has been reached, further elongation becomes very slow (Wahle, 1991b; Bienroth et al., 1993). This paper describes the reproduction of true length control in vitro and presents evidence that it is due to a switch from processive to distributive synthesis. PAB II was taken from the peak fraction of the preparation described earlier (Wahle et al., 1993). Protein concentration was 0.47 mg/ml as determined by a Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976) and 0.54 mg/ml as determined by quantitative amino acid analysis of a dialyzed aliquot (Wahle et al., 1993). Calculations were based on a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. CPSF was purified by a modification of the procedure of Bienroth et al.(1991). Spermine-agarose chromatography was left out. The pool of the poly(A)-Sepharose column was concentrated by centrifugation through Centricon-30 and further purified by gel filtration on a Superose 6 prep grade fast protein liquid chromatography column. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated on Centricon-30. Purity and activity were comparable with those of published preparations (Bienroth et al., 1991). Total protein concentration as determined by a Lowry assay (Scopes, 1987) was 0.52 mg/ml. Concentration measurements by densitometric scanning of the 73-kDa subunit in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and comparison to a BSA standard gave 0.13 mg/ml, assuming equimolar amounts of all subunits. Active CPSF as determined in a gel retardation assay (Bienroth et al., 1991) with excess L3pre RNA was at least 200 pmol/ml, corresponding to 0.07 mg/ml. The latter concentration was the basis of calculations. Poly(A) polymerase was a gift from Georges Martin. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli from the bovine cDNA (Wahle et al., 1991; Raabe et al., 1991) under the control of a T7 promoter with 6 N-terminal histidine residues. It was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Hochuli et al., 1987) followed by chromatography on a MonoQ-fast protein liquid chromatography column. ( 2G. Martin and W. Keller, personal communication. )The protein was nearly homogeneous on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The specific activity in the presence of Mn2+ and saturating amounts of oligo(A) primer was 19 × 106 units/mg, very similar to the activity of the 60-kDa proteolytic fragment purified from calf thymus (Wahle, 1991a). ( 3T. Wittmann and E. Wahle, unpublished results. )The concentration of poly(A) polymerase (0.15 mg/ml) was based on a comparison with a BSA standard on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Yeast poly(A) polymerase purified to homogeneity from recombinant E. coli (Lingner et al., 1991b) was a gift from Pascal Preker. Dilution buffer for all proteins was 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml methylated BSA, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol. The standard polyadenylation substrate L3pre, derived from the L3 polyadenylation site of adenovirus-2, and conditions for its synthesis by SP6 RNA polymerase have been described (Christofori and Keller, 1988; Bienroth et al., 1993). RNA was made without a cap. Products were run on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 1 × TBE, 8.3 M urea (Sambrook et al., 1989), and the RNA was eluted overnight at 37°C in 750 mM ammonium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, mixed with 0.1 volume of buffer-saturated phenol. The RNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. No carrier tRNA was added. The amount of RNA obtained was calculated from the specific activity of [α-32P]UTP and the number of U residues in the RNA. Transcription reactions also produced a small amount of a slightly shorter transcript. Because it was polyadenylated with the same efficiency as the correct RNA, no attempt was made to separate the two. Polyadenylated RNAs were made from gel-purified L3pre by the nonspecific Mn2+-dependent polyadenylation reaction essentially as described (Wahle, 1991b; Bienroth et al., 1993). RNAs with poly(A) tails of the desired lengths were gel-purified as above. Poly(A) tail lengths were determined on analytical polyacrylamide gels with end-labeled DNA fragments as markers. L3pre lacking poly(A) (expected size, 65 nucleotides) had an apparent length of approximately 70 nucleotides. tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim) was dissolved, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in water. Concentration measurements assumed that A260 = 1 corresponded to 40 μg/ml. Poly(A) (Boehringer Mannheim) was dissolved in water, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and dialyzed exhaustively against water. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically with ϵ258 =9800. Measurements after complete alkaline hydrolysis with ϵ259 = 15,400 (3′-AMP, pH 13) were in excellent agreement (less than 4% deviation). As analyzed by 5′-end labeling with polynucleotide kinase and gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, the poly(A) had a very heterogeneous size distribution. Most chains were longer than 200 nucleotides with a large fraction longer than the longest marker (622 nucleotides). SP6 RNA polymerase, yeast hexokinase, proteinase K, ATPγS, and AMPPNP were from Boehringer Mannheim. RNAguard, Superose 6 prep grade, and other fast protein liquid chromatography columns and equipment were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., radiolabeled nucleotides were from Amersham, Centricon-30 filtration devices were from Amicon, Inc., and polyethyleneimine plates for thin-layer chromatography were from Merck. Polyvinyl alcohol (cold water soluble) was from Sigma, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Diagen (Hilden, FRG). Methylated BSA was made as described (Wahle, 1991b). Reactions contained, in 25 μl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (measured at 1 M and room temperature), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2.6% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EDTA, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mg/ml methylated BSA, 0.5 mM ATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4 units of RNAguard, 80 fmol of radiolabeled substrate RNA, 9 fmol of poly(A) polymerase, 100 fmol of CPSF, and 200 fmol of PAB II. For some experiments, tRNA was added at 2.5 μg/reaction, and 18 fmol of poly(A) polymerase was used. For longer poly(A) tails, the amount of PAB II was increased as indicated for individual experiments. Incubations were at 37°C for the time indicated. For kinetic experiments, larger reaction mixtures (e.g. 10× = 250 μl) were assembled on ice in the absence of ATP and then prewarmed at 37°C. Polyadenylation was started by the addition of ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2-fold concentrated proteinase K digestion buffer (Wahle, 1991a) and water to a final volume of 100 μl. Digestion was carried out with 10 μg of proteinase K and 2.5 μg of tRNA for 30 min at 37°C. RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, dissolved in formamide loading buffer, and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels (40 cm long) in 1 × TBE, 8.3 M urea (Sambrook et al., 1989). Rates of polyadenylation were calculated from estimates of average poly(A) tail length after different times of reaction. Incorporation of [32P]AMP into unlabeled RNA was measured by adsorption to DE81 paper (Stayton and Kornberg, 1983). In experiments in which the production of ADP and AMP in polyadenylation reactions was measured by polyethyleneimine thin-layer chromatography, incorporated nucleotides were taken to be those remaining at the origin. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run according to Laemmli(1970). Nucleotides were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine plates with 1 M formic acid, 0.5 M LiCl as a solvent. Derivatives of the precleaved polyadenylation substrate RNA L3pre carrying poly(A) tails of different lengths were prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used in polyadenylation assays with purified poly(A) polymerase, CPSF, and PAB II. These reactions with premade poly(A) tails faithfully reproduced the length control seen during de novo poly(A) synthesis. An L3pre derivative carrying 30 adenylate residues at its 3′-end was elongated to an average tail length of approximately 250 nucleotides within 1 min or less. Further elongation was slow. This corresponds to the kinetics described previously (Wahle, 1991b; Bienroth et al., 1993). A derivative of the same RNA already carrying 250 adenylate residues did not undergo the initial burst of rapid elongation; it was only elongated in the slow mode (Fig. 1). RNAs with intermediate tail lengths were elongated rapidly to a tail length of 250 nucleotides before the elongation rate decreased (see below). Thus, the length control mechanism measures the length of the poly(A) tail present, rather than the time that poly(A) polymerase has spent elongating the substrate RNA. Further evidence for this conclusion will be presented below. From the same experiment one may also conclude that, whereas the burst of elongation of short tails is processive, the slow elongation of long tails is distributive. In the reaction, substrate RNA was present in excess over poly(A) polymerase. Elongation of a small fraction of the short tails to a length of 250 nucleotides with no extension of the majority of the substrate at early times is indicative of the processive nature of the reaction as described before (Bienroth et al., 1993). Under the same conditions, the entire population of RNA molecules carrying long tails was elongated in a synchronous manner, demonstrating a distributive behavior of the polymerase. Some shortening of the substrate, evident in Fig. 1, was due to an apparently nonspecific 3′-exonuclease activity that contaminates CPSF preparations. Exonucleolytic degradation of the labeled substrate RNA could be suppressed by the addition of tRNA (see below). However, for the sake of simplicity, this was not done in most experiments. Length control was only observed in reactions containing poly(A) polymerase with both stimulatory factors, CPSF and PAB II. When the reaction was carried out with either factor alone, elongation was slow even though a 10-fold higher concentration of poly(A) polymerase was used compared with the reaction containing both stimulatory factors (Fig. 2). The low rate of polyadenylation is due to the distributive nature of the reaction under these conditions (Bienroth et al., 1993). Most importantly, when poly(A) tail length was plotted versus time (Fig. 2B), no sudden drop in chain growth rate was observed at any particular tail length. A progressive decrease in the chain growth rate in the CPSF-dependent reaction is probably caused by the increasing distance between the CPSF binding site and the 3′-end to be elongated. The decrease in rate in the PAB II-dependent reaction is likely to be due to the decreasing ratio of PAB II to poly(A) (see below). Standard reaction conditions included 80 fmol of RNA, 100 fmol of CPSF, 200 fmol of PAB II, and 9 fmol of poly(A) polymerase. When the concentration of CPSF in the reaction was increased, length control was unchanged. Likewise, a 2-fold or 10-fold increase in PAB II concentration did not relieve length control (data not shown, but see Fig. 4). Measurements of the initial rate of poly(A) chain growth showed that the standard amount of PAB II was optimal with 9 or 180 fmol of poly(A) polymerase. Whereas at the higher concentration of poly(A) polymerase a significantly larger fraction of precursor RNA was elongated immediately after the start of the reaction, the initial rate of chain growth was not affected; it was 20-25 nt/s at either concentration of poly(A) polymerase (Fig. 3 and data not shown). This confirms the processive nature of the reaction. Other experiments showed that, in contrast, the elongation of long tails was proportional to the concentration of poly(A) polymerase, as expected for a distributive reaction (see below).Figure 3The initial rate of burst elongation. An 8× reaction mixture was assembled with L3pre-A30 in the absence of ATP. Compared with the standard conditions, a 20-fold higher concentration of poly(A) polymerase was used (180 fmol/25 μl). A 25-μl aliquot was withdrawn (0 min time point). The rest of the mixture was prewarmed for 3 min at 37°C and then kept at this temperature. 25-μl aliquots were drawn up into a pipette tip, expelled into prewarmed tubes containing ATP, drawn up into the same pipette tip, and transferred to proteinase K digestion buffer. The size of DNA markers (in nucleotides) is indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The requirement for only a 2-3-fold molar excess of PAB II over RNA was surprising. An estimate of a packing density of 1 PAB II molecule/23 adenylate residues (Wahle et al., 1993) suggests that the amount of PAB II used in these experiments is sufficient to coat the short oligo(A) tails present at the beginning of the reaction but not the long tails generated during elongation. Therefore, the PAB II requirement was tested during burst elongation of different initial poly(A) tail lengths (Fig. 4). As mentioned above, burst elongation at optimal PAB II concentrations always generated the same final poly(A) tail length, irrespective of the initial tail length. Higher concentrations of PAB II did not overcome the length limitation; in fact, they were inhibitory with respect both to the tail length generated and the number of molecules elongated. Suboptimal concentrations of PAB II also led to shorter average poly(A) tails. With 80 fmol of an A20 tail, 200 fmol of PAB II were optimal (8 adenylates/PAB II based on initial tail length), with an A80 tail, 300 fmol of PAB II were optimal (20 adenylates/PAB II), and with an A150 tail, 400 fmol of PAB II were optimal (30 adenylates/PAB II). Although it is apparent that optimal elongation requires more than a single molecule of PAB II for each poly(A) tail, the effect of different PAB II concentrations was not very strong, and the interpretation of PAB II titrations in this type of reaction is not straightforward (see “Discussion”). Thus, the PAB II requirement was also tested in the elongation of poly(A) tails in the absence of CPSF. This simpler reaction showed a much more pronounced dependence on the exact PAB II concentration. The elongation of 80 fmol of an RNA with an A350 tail was most efficient with 1200 fmol of PAB II. This corresponds to a ratio of between 1 PAB II/23 adenylate residues, based on the initial tail length, and 1 PAB II/30 adenylate residues, based on the final tail length of 450 nucleotides. Higher concentrations of PAB II were inhibitory. Additional titrations, some of them with shorter poly(A) tails, gave comparable ratios (Table 1), their accuracy being limited by the number of nucleotides added during the reaction. Saturation of the same molar quantities of shorter tails at lower concentrations of PAB II is not only further evidence that coating of the tail is required but also demonstrates that the experiments measured the stoichiometry of the PAB II requirement rather than the affinity of PAB II for poly(A). In the elongation of a simple unlabeled poly(A) primer with radiolabeled ATP, the amount of PAB II required for maximum incorporation was also proportional to the amount of poly(A) present. Saturation was achieved near 35 nucleotides/PAB II monomer (Fig. 5). Inhibition became apparent with amounts of PAB II exceeding 1/30 adenylate residues. In these experiments, AMP incorporation at the optimum levels of PAB II was between 20 and 38% of the poly(A) added as a primer. The optimal ratio of protein to poly(A) based on the initial poly(A) concentration may thus be slightly overestimated.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 5PAB II dependence of poly(A) elongation in the absence of CPSF. A 34× reaction was assembled lacking CPSF, PAB II, RNA, and ATP. Poly(A) polymerase was included at 360 fmol/25 μl. The mixture was split into three equal aliquots, which received unlabeled high molecular weight poly(A) at 273, 137, and 55 pmol of AMP/25 μl, respectively. 25-μl aliquots of each mixture were mixed with PAB II as indicated. Reactions were started by the addition of ATP and transfer to 37°C. After 30 min, they were stopped by application to DE81 paper. Background was determined by application of ice-cold reaction mixtures lacking PAB II to DE81 paper immediately after the addition of ATP. The value obtained (0.8 pmol of AMP) was subtracted from the incorporation measured in all other reactions.

In the experiments described in Table 1, excessively long tails were elongated by 100 or more nucleotides in the presence of the optimal PAB II concentration, whereas PAB II-independent elongation was barely detectable. In fact, more precise measurements showed that the elongation rate of long tails was, if anything, slightly higher than the elongation rate of short tails at their respective PAB II optima (Table 2). Similarly, poly(A) polymerase assisted by CPSF was only 5-fold slower on long compared with short tails. This may reflect the distance between the 3′-end being elongated and the CPSF binding site. A serious deficiency of long tails was apparent only in the presence of both PAB II and CPSF; long tails were extended 300-fold more slowly than short tails. Whereas the simultaneous presence of both factors increased the elongation rate for short tails by a factor of 300-1000 compared with either factor alone, the effect was only 2-5-fold for long tails (Table 2). When, in the presence of both stimulatory factors, the concentration of poly(A) polymerase was increased up to 10-fold, the elongation rate of long tails increased proportionally (data not shown). This is further evidence for a distributive mechanism as discussed above. The rate of extension of long tails in the presence of both CPSF and PAB II was at least as high as with either factor alone and about 50-fold higher than in the absence of any stimulatory factor (near 0.1 nt/min under these conditions). Thus, length control is not due to an inhibition of the elongation of long poly(A) tails. Neither is it due to a lack of interaction between poly(A) polymerase and CPSF or PAB II. Rather, it is caused by the inability of long tails to mediate the simultaneous effects of PAB II and CPSF on poly(A) polymerase that are the basis for the burst of processive elongation of short tails.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A simple possibility for length control would be the length-dependent formation of an RNA-protein complex that prevents further elongation by sequestering the 3′-end of the RNA. Although the lack of inhibition evident from Table 2 does not suggest this model, it can be more rigorously tested by the use of an enzyme that elongates the RNA nonspecifically. One such enzyme is poly(A) polymerase of yeast. Because the yeast enzyme does not respond to mammalian CPSF and PAB II (Lingner et al., 1991a, 1991b) (additional data not shown), a 90-fold larger amount of yeast poly(A) polymerase compared with the mammalian enzyme was used for reasonable chain growth rates. No control of poly(A) tail length was found. With an RNA carrying 30 A residues, the initial rate of elongation was 14 nt/min until a total tail length of 70 As had been reached. The elongation rate was 8 nt/min in the interval between 125 and 300 adenylates and 6 nt/min between 300 and 500 adenylates. In a control reaction with a second aliquot of the same reaction mixture, mammalian poly(A) polymerase showed the expected kinetics. When a mixture of short and long premade tails was used, yeast poly(A) polymerase in the presence of CPSF and PAB II elongated both substrates at similar rates (25 nt/min for short tails and 10 nt/min for long tails), whereas the mammalian enzyme first elongated the short tails to nearly 250 adenylates before it touched the long tails (Fig. 6). In conclusion, these experiments suggest that there is no sequestration of the 3′-end of the poly(A) tail to terminate elongation. When in an experiment as shown in Fig. 6 both yeast and mammalian poly(A) polymerase were present simultaneously, no sequestration was observed either. In more general terms, CPSF and PAB II are not sufficient for length control. The mammalian poly(A) polymerase is needed, because, in the presence of the two stimulatory factors, this enzyme but not the yeast enzyme is capable of processive burst elongation. DNA polymerases as well as RNA polymerases have exonucleolytic activities (Brutlag and Kornberg, 1972; Kornberg and Baker, 1992; Surratt et al., 1991; Kassavetis and Geiduschek, 1993), and the same has been claimed for poly(A) polymerase (Abraham and Jacob, 1978; Tarui and Minamikawa, 1989). Therefore, the possibility was considered that exonucleolytic shortening of the poly(A) tail might play a role in length control. For these experiments, the exonuclease activity contaminating the CPSF preparation (see above) had to be suppressed by tRNA as a nonspecific competitor. This did not cause any change in length control. When under these conditions poly(A) synthesis was abruptly stopped at a late stage by ATP depletion with hexokinase and glucose, the poly(A) tails that had been synthesized were completely stable, even though they exceeded a length of 250 nucleotides (data not shown). When a mixture of short and excessively long tails was exposed to the polyadenylation factors in the absence of ATP, both were completely stable during extended incubations. Upon addition of ATP, short tails were preferentially extended in a processive manner (Fig. 7). Finally, when under similar conditions [α-32P]ATP was used to elongate unlabeled L3pre RNA, AMP production (as a result of exonucleolytic excision of incorporated nucleotides) was at the limit of detection, at most 5% of the net incorporation. Analysis of additional aliquots of the same reaction by gel electrophoresis demonstrated that length control was normal, and both the gel pattern and calculations showed that incorporation was almost exclusively into the polyadenylation substrate and not the tRNA used to suppress the exonuclease (data not shown). In conclusion, exonuclease activity is not involved in poly(A) tail length control. Tests under stringent conditions have also not detected any poly(A)-degrading activity in poly(A) polymerase itself.3 We have previously reported that poly(A) polymerase can use ATP analogs with nonhydrolyzable β-γ bonds (Bienroth et al., 1993). Length control is also functional with these analogs; in a kinetic experiment, elongation with AMPPNP proceeded approximately 50-fold more slowly than with ATP and slowed down at a tail length of about 200 nucleotides. After 90 min, when elongation had become very slow, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was added to fresh oligoadenylated precursor RNA. This fresh substrate was still elongated, effectively competing out the previously made tails (data not shown). Thus, in spite of the long incubation time, inactivation of proteins was not the reason for the decrease in the elongation rate. Experiments with ATPγS also showed normal length control with an elongation rate intermediate between ATP and AMPPNP (data not shown). In a competition between long and short tails, the polyadenylation machinery almost exclusively selected the short RNA in the presence of ATP, ATPγS, or AMPPNP (Fig. 8). Thus, the hydrolysis of the β-γ bond of ATP is not required for length control. (All experiments involving AMPPNP were done in the presence of hexokinase and glucose to exclude possible ATP contaminations. In control experiments with ATP, hexokinase completely abolished polyadenylation within seconds.) From the same experiments, one may also conclude that length control is essentially insensitive to large changes in the rate of chain elongation. This confirms that, as discussed above, the length control mechanism truly measures the length of the poly(A) tail present. The cell controls the length of poly(A) tails in three ways: during synthesis in the nucleus, during shortening in the cytoplasm, and, at least in special cases, during readenylation in the cytoplasm. The first type of control, limitation of poly(A) tail synthesis to a length of approximately 250 nucleotides, can be reconstituted from three purified proteins, poly(A) polymerase, CPSF, and PAB II. The two stimulatory factors, which are also responsible for the primer specificity of the polyadenylation reaction, act by forming a complex that includes poly(A) polymerase and the substrate RNA. This complex is able to synthesize a full-length poly(A) tail processively without disintegration (Bienroth et al., 1993). The length of poly(A) tails generated during this processive burst of synthesis was higher in this study than in previous experiments (Wahle, 1991b). The reason seems to be that length control depends on certain properties of poly(A) polymerase.3 Whereas previously the proteolytically shortened poly(A) polymerase from calf thymus (Wahle, 1991a) was used, the experiments reported here were carried out with a full-length protein purified from recombinant E. coli. This observation suggests that length control is not rigid and may be subject to regulation. Once a full-length tail has been made, polyadenylation essentially terminates by a transition from processive to distributive elongation. Direct evidence for a distributive elongation of long poly(A) tails is a synchronous elongation of all RNA molecules under conditions of limiting poly(A) polymerase and a dependence of the elongation rate on the concentration of poly(A) polymerase. By both criteria, elongation of short tails is processive. The processivity of the latter reaction has also been demonstrated by a primer challenge experiment (Bienroth et al., 1993). Also, under conditions that only allow distributive elongation of short tails (presence of only one stimulatory factor), there is no significant difference between the elongation rates of short and long tails. Thus, a switch from processive to distributive elongation as the mechanism for length control also explains the protein requirements of the reaction; only those conditions that are appropriate for processive elongation of short tails show length control. This includes the presence of both CPSF and PAB II and the use of a homologous poly(A) polymerase. Under all other conditions, long and short tails behave quite similarly. Also, under conditions appropriate for length control, long tails still grow at a rate far exceeding the unstimulated rate observed with poly(A) polymerase alone. Thus, there is no lack of stimulation by individual factors and no inhibition of the elongation of long tails. In particular, the two RNA binding factors do not sequester the 3′-end of the RNA in a nonaccessible complex once the correct length has been reached. There is only a specific inability of long tails to mediate the interaction of all three proteins that is responsible for processive elongation. The length control mechanism involves a true measurement of poly(A) tail length, as evidenced by the function of length control with premade poly(A) tails of different lengths, the lack of sensitivity to large changes in the rate of elongation, and the ability of the polyadenylation machinery to discriminate between short and long tails when challenged with a mixture of the two. What is the yard stick that the polyadenylation complex uses to measure poly(A) tail length? The most obvious possibility is that the complex senses the number of PAB II molecules it contains. PAB II can coat high molecular weight poly(A) at a stoichiometry of nearly 25 nt/protein (Wahle et al., 1993), and there is no reason why it should not do so during poly(A) tail elongation. In the absence of CPSF, elongation of a poly(A) tail clearly requires its binding of multiple molecules of PAB II. The optimal amount of PAB II tends to be slightly less than expected from measurements of binding stoichiometry; thus elongation may be most efficient when tails are not completely coated. The requirement for a similar amount of PAB II in the presence of CPSF is more apparent when the poly(A) tails present at the start of the reaction are longer (Fig. 4). This reveals that the experiment is probably unable to measure the true PAB II optimum. The higher concentrations that are optimal for the long tails generated during the reaction are inhibitory for the short ones present initially (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). If the measurement of poly(A) tail length involves coating the tail with PAB II, one might predict that, at the low PAB II concentrations sufficient to induce processive elongation of short tails, length control should not be functional. Evidently, this is not the case. This might mean that the termination of processive elongation depends on poly(A) tail length in a manner not involving the number of PAB II molecules. However, detailed kinetics always showed a lack of synchrony during burst elongation (Fig. 3). Thus, the number of PAB II molecules bound to an individual poly(A) tail may differ from what is calculated from the molar ratio in the entire reaction, because the population of RNA molecules is probably heterogeneous. Some molecules may recruit a sufficient amount of PAB II to terminate processive synthesis, whereas others may be devoid of PAB II and thus also fail to be elongated efficiently. Regardless of the exact mechanism, a disruption of the polyadenylation complex must take place once 250 As have been polymerized. The nature of this event remains to be determined. From careful in vivo pulse-labeling studies of HeLa cells, Sawicki et al.(1977) concluded that there were two distinct modes of adenosine incorporation into nuclear poly(A) tails. Synthesis of a full-length poly(A) tail of about 230 nucleotides was found to take less than a minute. In addition, poly(A) tails that were already full-length at the time of pulse labeling were subject to a slower end addition with 5-10 nucleotides added in a 2-min pulse. It is reassuring that the kinetics described here for the purified in vitro system can fully account for the in vivo incorporation kinetics.

Bromamines differed from HOBr/OBr- in that bromamines reacted slowly with H2O2, were not reduced by dimethyl sulfoxide, and had absorption spectra similar to those of chloramines, but shifted 36 nm toward higher wavelengths. Mono- and di-bromo derivatives (RNHBr and RNHBr2) of the βamino acid taurine were relatively stable with half-lives of 70 and 16 h at pH 7, 37°C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4903-4910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be the physiologic substrate for EPO. Two problems make it difficult to measure bromide oxidation by isolated leukocytes or the purified peroxidase enzymes. First, MPO and EPO catalyze the oxidation of chloride, and products of chloride oxidation can oxidize other halides in secondary, non-enzymatic reactions. For example, HOCl/OCl- oxidizes bromide to HOBr/OBr-. H2O2+H++Cl-→H2O+HOCl HOCl+Br-→Cl-+HOBr HOCl/OCl- and other chlorinating agents also react with ammonia and amines to produce chloramines, which contain covalent nitrogen-chlorine bonds(11Thomas E.L. Learn D.B. Grisham M.B. Everse J. Peroxidases: Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 83-104Google Scholar). Chloramines retain the two oxidizing equivalents of HOCl/OCl- and might oxidize bromide to HOBr/OBr- or undergo exchange with bromide and be converted to bromamines(12Ritter C.L. Malejka-Giganti D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HOCl+RNH2→H2O+RNNCl Br-+RNHCl→Cl-+RNHBr Therefore, the formation of bromamines or other brominated products does not necessarily indicate that bromide was oxidized by MPO or EPO. The second problem is that HOBr/OBr- is reduced by H2O2, resulting in the loss of oxidizing and brominating activity. The net result of bromide oxidation and HOBr/OBr- reduction is the conversion of 2 mol of H2O2 to 2 mol of water and one of molecular oxygen (O2), which is the same result that would be obtained by adding catalase. H2O2+H++Br-→H2O+HOBrH2O2+HOBr→H2O+H++Br-+O2 Reduction of HOBr/OBr- by H2O2 is accompanied by formation of singlet oxygen, which rapidly releases energy as light and forms O2(13Kanofsky J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5991-5993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under some conditions, the light emitted by singlet oxygen provides an indirect measure of the amount of bromide that was oxidized to HOBr/OBr-(14Kanofsky J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5596-5600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the detection of singlet oxygen would not indicate whether bromide was oxidized by MPO or EPO or by products of chloride oxidation. Moreover, singlet oxygen may also be produced in the reduction of HOCl/OCl- by H2O2. Little or no singlet oxygen is detected when MPO (15Kanofsky J.R. Wright J. Miles-Richardson G.E. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or EPO (16Kanofsky J.R. Hoogland H. Wever R. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9692-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is incubated with H2O2 and chloride, probably as a result of inactivation of the enzyme. Similarly, HOCl/OCl- does not accumulate in the medium(17Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MPO is rapidly inactivated by HOCl/OCl-, bringing chloride oxidation to a halt and leaving H2O2 in the medium. The production of chlorinating agents is observed only when chloride oxidation takes place in the presence of a trap for HOCl/OCl-. The trap may be an aromatic compound that undergoes rapid chlorination to yield a stable product with a carbon-chlorine bond (18Harrison J.E. Schultz J. Ahmad F. Cancer Enzymology. Vol. 2. Academic Press, Inc., New York1976: 305-316Google Scholar, 19Foote C.S. Goyne T.E. Lehrer R.I. Nature. 1982; 301: 715-716Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Hurst J.K. Albrich J.M. Green T.R.

One mol of chloramine is produced per mole of H2O2 when the enzyme, chloride, and amine concentrations are sufficiently high(11Thomas E.L. Learn D.B. Grisham M.B. Everse J. Peroxidases: Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 83-104Google Scholar). The rapid reaction of HOCl/OCl- with the amine prevents inactivation of the enzyme by HOCl/OCl- and the reduction of HOCl/OCl- by H2O2. Unlike HOCl/OCl-, chloramines are not reduced by H2O2(11Thomas E.L. Learn D.B. Grisham M.B. Everse J. Peroxidases: Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 83-104Google Scholar, 23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Because chloramine derivatives of α-amino acids are unstable, the β-amino acid taurine is often used as a trap for HOCl/OCl-. Chlorination of taurine yields relatively non-toxic, anionic, membrane-impermeable oxidants (22Thomas E.L. Infect. Immun. 1979; 25: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B.

Mutation Res. 1987; 188: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that can be measured based on the ability of chloramines to oxidize sulfhydryl compounds such as Nbs, thioethers such as methionine, or iodide ion (23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Mono- and di-chloramine derivatives of taurine are much less reactive than HOCl/OCl-, particularly in the oxidation of disulfide bonds and chlorination of phenols(23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Leukocytes contain high levels of taurine in the cytosol(27Learn D.B. Fried V.A. Thomas E.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 48: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), probably to trap oxidized forms of chloride and bromide and protect the cells against oxidation and halogenation. Peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of bromide in the presence of α-amino acids yielded unstable bromamines (7Cramer R. Soranzo M.R. Patriarca P. Blood. 1981; 58: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kanofsky J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that rapidly decomposed to products without oxidizing and brominating activity(29Wajon J.E. Morris J.C. Inorg. Chem. 1982; 21: 4258-4263Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unlike chloramines, the bromamines were reduced by H2O2(28Kanofsky J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients of 415-420 M-1•cm-1 were reported for mono-bromamines at 289 nm(29Wajon J.E. Morris J.C. Inorg. Chem. 1982; 21: 4258-4263Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), similar to the value of 429 M-1•cm-1 obtained for mono-chloramines at 252 nm(23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to characterize the oxidants produced by incubating MPO or EPO with H2O2 and bromide in the absence of chloride or with physiologic levels of both bromide and chloride, using taurine as a trap for oxidized forms of bromide and chloride. As described below, 1 mol of bromamine was produced per mole of H2O2 when the enzyme, bromide, and taurine concentrations were sufficiently high. Bromamine formation prevented the reduction of HOBr/OBr- by H2O2, and all of the H2O2 was consumed in bromide oxidation before reduction of bromamines by H2O2 could take place. In addition, trapping of HOCl/OCl- by the amine prevented the oxidation of bromide in secondary non-enzymatic reactions. Therefore, enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of bromide or chloride in mixtures of the two ions could be measured by analyzing the mixture of bromamines and chloramines that was produced. MPO and EPO were purified (30Bozeman P.M. Learn D.B. Thomas E.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) from cytoplasmic granules of human granulocytes and stored at −70°C in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.7. The ratio of 430 to 280 nm absorbance was 0.86 ± 0.04 (mean ± S.D.) for three preparations of MPO, and the ratio of 415 to 280 nm absorbance was 1.00 ±.04 for three preparations of EPO, indicating a high degree of purity and no cross-contamination. Concentrations were calculated assuming extinction coefficients of 89,000 and 112,000 M-1• cm-1/iron of MPO (31Agner K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1963; 17: S332-S338Crossref Google Scholar) and EPO(32Bolscher B.G.J.M. Plat H. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 33Carlson M.G.C. Peterson C.G.B. Venge P. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1875-1879PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the MPO dimer (34Andrews P.C. Krinsky N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4211-4218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was half the indicated concentration of the heme-like chromophore(35Hurst J.K. Grisham M.B. Everse J. Peroxidases: Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar). Bromine (Br2), sodium hypochlorite (4-6%), H2O2 (30%), and potassium bromide were from Fisher Chemical Co. Sodium chloride (containing 0.005% bromide and 0.001% iodide) was from BDH Limited, Poole, United Kingdom. Dimethyl sulfoxide (high performance liquid chromatography grade) was from Aldrich. Taurine, DETAPAC, superoxide dismutase, 2-mercaptoethanol, and Nbs2 were from Sigma. Catalase crystals (Boehringer Mannheim) were washed twice by centrifugation in water and dissolved at 0.3 mg/ml in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 15 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Taurine (0.2 M) and DETAPAC (0.1 M) were adjusted to pH 7 with KOH. Fresh 0.1 M potassium bromide solutions were prepared daily in water. H2O2 was diluted into autoclaved water and the concentration determined from the extinction coefficient of 70 M-1• cm-1 at 230 nm. To prepare Nbs, 100 ml of a 1 mM Nbs2 solution in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 10 mM taurine, 0.3 mM DETAPAC, 1 μg of superoxide dismutase/ml, and 1 μg of catalase/ml in 15 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was reduced with 4 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol(23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To prepare 5 mM HOBr/OBr-, bromine (25 μl) was added to 4.5 ml of cold 1.0 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and then diluted with 87 ml of cold water. The concentration was confirmed by diluting the HOBr/OBr- solution 10-fold into 0.1 M taurine with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, measuring absorbance at 288 nm, and calculating the concentration of the mono-bromamine derivative assuming an extinction coefficient of 430 M-1• cm-1. To prepare 5 mM HOCl/OCl-, sodium hypochlorite was diluted 20-fold into 0.1 M KOH, and this solution was diluted 50-fold into 0.1 M taurine in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Absorbance at 252 nm was measured(23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and the concentration of the mono-chloramine derivative was calculated assuming an extinction coefficient of 429 M-1• cm-1. Based on this calculation, the hypochlorite solution in KOH was diluted to 5 mM with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chloride or bromide was carried out in 1 ml total volume of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37°C. The concentration of oxidants was measured by the assay based on oxidation of two molecules of the sulfhydryl compound Nbs to the disulfide Nbs2(23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 36Aune T.M. Thomas E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures were placed on ice, and 0.05 ml of 0.3 mg/ml catalase was added, followed by 0.05 ml of 0.2 M taurine, 1.5 ml of the Nbs solution, and 5 ml of 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 0.3 mM DETAPAC in 30 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Absorbance at 409 nm was measured(37Bozeman P.M Learn D.B Thomas E.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the oxidant concentration (mM) was calculated from the difference in absorbance between the control and sample, times the ratio of the final and starting volumes (7.6), divided by the extinction coefficient for Nbs (14.05 mM-1• cm-1), all divided by 2, because each oxidized chlorine or bromine atom oxidizes two molecules of Nbs. Results shown are the mean of duplicate determinations, and the mean standard error was ±2 μM. Absorption spectra of mono- and di-bromamine derivatives of the amine compound taurine are compared in Fig. 1. Identical spectra were obtained with other primary amines. The mono-bromamine had a single peak at 288 nm. The di-bromamine had major and minor peaks at 241 and 336 nm, each 47-48 nm distant from the mono-bromamine peak. Extinction coefficients of mono- and di-bromamines are compared with values for the analogous chloramine derivatives (23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) in the legend. Bromamine spectra were similar to chloramine spectra but shifted 36 nm toward higher wavelengths. The absorbance at 288 nm and either 241 or 336 nm provided a method to measure amounts of mono- and di-bromamine in mixtures of the two. Results of adding the same amount of HOBr/OBr- to solutions containing various amounts of taurine are shown in Fig. 2. The highest ratio of 241:288 nm absorbance was obtained when the ratio of HOBr/OBr- to amine was 2:1, consistent with formation of the di-bromamine. The 288 nm absorbance increased sharply at higher amine concentrations. With 1 mM taurine, or a ratio of HOBr/OBr- to amine of 1:2, half of the oxidized bromine atoms were in the mono-bromamine and half in the di-bromamine. With 10 mM taurine, 90% of the bromine atoms were in the mono-bromamine. The solution obtained at 100 mM taurine contained only the mono-bromamine, in that the ratio of 288 to 241 nm absorbance did not increase at higher amine concentrations. For comparison, the same amount of HOCl/OCl- was added to solutions containing various amounts of taurine (not shown). The yields of mono- and di-chloramine were calculated from absorbance at 205 and 252 nm(23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The highest ratio of 205:252 nm absorbance was obtained at a 2:1 ratio of HOCl/OCl- to amine, consistent with formation of the di-chloramine. With 1 mM taurine, 90% of the oxidized chlorine atoms were in the mono-chloramine. The ratio of 252 to 205 nm absorbance reached a maximum at 10-30 mM amine. The results indicate that the reaction of HOBr/OBr- with amines tended to produce di-halo rather than mono-halo derivatives when compared with the formation of chloramines. To obtain a solution in which 90% of the oxidizing equivalents were in the mono-halo derivative, a 20-fold excess of amine over HOBr/OBr- or a 2-fold excess of amine over HOCl/OCl- was required. In addition to the characteristic absorption spectra of the bromamines, differences in stability and chemical reactivity made it possible to distinguish between bromamines and HOBr/OBr-. The rate of loss of oxidizing activity of bromamines is shown in Fig. 3. Less than 5% decomposition was observed in the first hour. About half the amount of the mono-bromamine was still present after 4 days. Loss of the di-bromamine was faster and similar to the decomposition of HOBr/OBr-. Decomposition appeared exponential with half-lives of 70 h for the mono-bromamine and 16 h for the di-bromamine or HOBr/OBr-. As shown in Fig. 4, HOBr/OBr- was reduced rapidly by dimethyl sulfoxide with a 1:1 stoichiometry, consistent with reduction of HOBr/OBr- to bromide and oxidation of the sulfoxide (CH3SOCH3) to the sulfone (CH3SO2CH3). The reaction was complete within the time required for mixing even on ice. In contrast, bromamines did not react with a 2-fold excess of dimethyl sulfoxide within 1 h at 37°C. These results indicate that mono- and di-bromamine solutions obtained at HOBr/OBr- to amine ratios of 1:200 and 2:1 did not contain detectable amounts of free HOBr/OBr-, which would have been instantly reduced by dimethyl sulfoxide. Moreover, hydrolysis of bromamines to yield HOBr/OBr - was too slow to be measurable within 1 h at 37°C. The difference in reactivity of HOBr/OBr- and bromamines with dimethyl sulfoxide was the same as with HOCl/OCl- and chloramines(23Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there was a difference in the reactivity of chloramines and bromamines with H2O2. As shown in Fig. 5(left), HOBr/OBr- was rapidly reduced by H2O2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry, consistent with reduction of HOBr/OBr- to bromide and oxidation of H2O2 to water and O2. The reaction was complete within the time required for mixing on ice. HOCl/OCl- was also instantly reduced by H2O2 (not shown). Bromamines were reduced with a 1:1 stoichiometry when incubated with H2O2 for 30 min at 37°C (Fig. 5, left). The di-bromamine was reduced faster than the mono-bromamine, but both were reduced within 30 min (Fig. 5, right). In contrast, chloramines did not react with H2O2 within 1 h at 37°C (not shown). Reduction of bromamines could be the result of direct attack of H2O2 on bromamines, or the bromamines could hydrolyze to yield HOBr/OBr-, which would then react with H2O2. The results obtained with dimethyl sulfoxide and H2O2 indicate that hydrolysis was undetectable and that bromamines reacted directly with H2O2. HOBr+H2O2→H2O+H++Br-+O2RNHBr+H2O2→RNH2+H++Br-+O2RNBr2+H2O2→RNH2+2H++2Br-+2O2 Differences in the reactivity of chloramines and bromamines with H2O2 provided a method to measure amounts of chloramines and bromamines in mixtures of the two. When mixtures were incubated with excess H2O2 for 30 min at 37°C, only chloramines remained (Fig. 6). The amount of oxidant that was reduced by H2O2 was equal to the amount of bromamines. Oxidation of bromide by HOCl/OCl- and chloramines was compared (Table 1). First, HOBr/OBr- and HOCl/OCl- were added to solutions containing a 200-fold excess of amine to obtain the mono-bromamine and mono-chloramine. The 288 to 252 nm absorbance ratios were 2.4 and 0.21 for the bromamine and chloramine, and there was no significant change in the spectra within 1 h at 37°C.Tabled 1 When HOCl/OCl- was added to a bromide solution and then the amine was added, the mono-bromamine was the only observed product, as indicated by the high absorbance ratio. The results indicate that HOCl/OCl- rapidly oxidized bromide to HOBr/OBr-. When the amine was added, all of the HOCl/OCl- was gone, and only HOBr/OBr- was available to react with the amine. In contrast, when HOCl/OCl- was added to the amine to form the mono-chloramine and then bromide was added, the mono-chloramine was the only product, and there was no change within 1 h at 37°C. The mono-chloramine did not oxidize bromide to HOBr/OBr-, and there was no exchange of bromide with the oxidized chlorine atom of the chloramine. Similarly, when HOCl/OCl- was added to a mixture of the amine and bromide, only the mono-chloramine was obtained. Although the oxidation of bromide by HOCl/OCl- was a fast reaction, the reaction of HOCl/OCl- with the amine was much faster when the bromide/amine ratio was 1:100. Once the mono-chloramine was formed, it did not oxidize bromide or undergo exchange with bromide. The results indicate that when a high concentration of amine was present, the addition of HOCl/OCl- did not result in the formation of bromamines. Bromamines were obtained only when HOBr/OBr- was added. In other experiments, 0.5 mM HOCl/OCl- was added to 0.25 mM taurine to obtain the di-chloramine, and then 1 mM bromide was added. There was no change in the spectrum within 1 h at 37°C, indicating that the di-chloramine did not oxidize bromide or undergo exchange with bromide. On the other hand, the di-bromamine was the major product when 0.5 mM HOCl/OCl- was added to a mixture of 1 mM bromide and 0.25 mM taurine. Therefore, HOCl/OCl- reacted faster with bromide than with the amine when the bromide/amine ratio was 4:1. Amine concentrations of at least 10 mM were required to block the oxidation of bromide by HOCl/OCl-. Rates of bromide oxidation by MPO and EPO were compared with 100 mM taurine as a trap for HOBr/OBr- (Fig. 7). With both enzymes, an oxidant accumulated in the medium that could be measured at the end of the incubation by adding catalase to remove H2O2 and then adding Nbs and measuring the oxidation of 2 Nbs to Nbs2. As shown below, the oxidant was identified as the mono-bromamine. At a high level of bromide (10 mM), the yield of bromamine was stoichiometric, 1 mol of bromamine/mol of H2O2. Therefore, all of the H2O2 was used in bromide oxidation, and all of the HOBr/OBr- was trapped by the amine. At equal enzyme concentrations (0.1 μM heme), faster bromide oxidation was obtained with EPO than with MPO. In addition, EPO produced a stoichiometric yield of bromamine at lower bromide concentrations. With MPO, the yield was much less than stoichiometric when bromide was less than 1 mM. Under conditions that gave less than 1 mol of bromamine/mol of H2O2, the yield as well as the rate was increased by raising the enzyme concentration. These results suggest that the enzymes lost activity during the incubations and that the production of bromamine stopped when enzyme activity went to zero. As shown below, MPO was converted to the Compound II form under these conditions. MPO was incubated with excess bromide (10 mM), 0.1 mM H2O2, and various concentrations of taurine, and the absorption spectra of the products were measured (Fig. 8). Similar results were obtained with EPO (not shown). With 0.05 mM taurine, which would be enough to trap 0.1 mM HOBr/OBr- as the di-bromamine, the 241 nm peak of the di-bromamine and the 288 nm peak of the mono-bromamine were observed, indicating a mixture of the two. When the amount of taurine was increased to 10 mM or higher, the spectra shifted, and only the 288 nm peak of the mono-bromamine was observed. The yields of mono- and di-bromamine were calculated from the 241 and 288 nm absorbance and plotted versus taurine in the inset. The yield of stable oxidants was less than 1 mol/mol of H2O2 when the amine concentration was less than 10 mM. With 0.1 mM taurine, which was equal to the amount of H2O2 added, the yield of oxidant was 50%. Half of the oxidized bromine atoms were in 0.025 mM mono-bromamine and half in 0.0125 mM di-bromamine. The results indicate that the di-bromamine was a major product at low amine concentrations. As described below, the low yield of oxidants at low amine concentrations was the result of reduction of HOBr/OBr- and the di-bromamine by H2O2. Absorption spectra of the enzyme (MPO) rather than the product (bromamines) are shown in Fig. 9. Absorbance of 0.1 mM bromamine was higher than that of 0.2 μM enzyme, but there was no overlap of the bromamine ultraviolet absorbance with the visible spectrum of MPO. When MPO was incubated with low bromide (0.2 mM), 0.1 mM H2O2, and excess taurine (100 mM), a low yield of bromamine was obtained. MPO was converted to the Compound II form under these conditions, as indicated by the shift of absorbance from 430 to 456 nm and the increased absorbance at 625 nm (Fig. 9, left). The ratio of 625 to 456 nm absorbance was 0.25, indicating that little or no Compound III was present(38Hoogland H. van Kuilenburg A. van Riel C. Muijsers A.O. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There was a substantial loss of absorbance that increased with time, consistent with destruction of the heme group by excess H2O2. The same results were obtained in the absence of bromide (not shown), indicating that H2O2 rather than products of bromide oxidation destroyed the heme group. When catalase was added to remove the excess H2O2, what was left of the heme absorbance shifted back to 430 nm, consistent with reversion of Compound II to ferric MPO. Compound II is an intermediate in the oxidation of one-electron donors such as phenols and aromatic amines by peroxidase enzymes, but Compound II does not oxidize two-electron donors such as halide ions(11Thomas E.L. Learn D.B. Grisham M.B. Everse J. Peroxidases: Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 83-104Google Scholar, 35Hurst J.K. Grisham M.B. Everse J. Peroxidases: Chemistry and Biology. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar, 39Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, accumulation of MPO in the Compound II form accounts for the slowing of the rate of bromide oxidation and the low yield of bromamine at low bromide concentrations. A low yield of oxidants was also obtained when MPO was incubated with high bromide (10 mM), 0.1 mM H2O2, and low taurine, but there was no shift or loss of MPO absorbance at low taurine concentrations (Fig. 9, right). In other experiments, no loss of MPO or EPO activity was observed when the incubation mixtures were diluted to lower the bromide concentration, and activity was measured in an assay that is proportional to the amount of active enzyme(30Bozeman P.M. Learn D.B. Thomas E.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the low yield of oxidants was the result of reduction of HOBr/OBr- and bromamines by H2O2 rather than inactivation of the enzymes. Reduction of HOBr/OBr- and bromamines by H2O2 was confirmed by measuring the production of O2 by the MPO-H2O2-bromide system, using an O2 electrode. One mol of O2 was produced per 2 mol of H2O2 within 2 min at 37°C by the mixture of 0.1 μM MPO, 0.1-0.3 mM H2O2, and 10 mM bromide. The yield of O2 was the same as when catalase rather than MPO was added. Production of O2 by the MPO-H2O2-bromide system with 0.1 mM H2O2 was cut in half by 0.1 mM taurine, and no O2 was produced when 10 mM taurine was present. Therefore, trapping of HOBr/OBr- by high levels of amine prevented the reduction of oxidants by H2O2. The yield of stable oxidants obtained with and without chloride was compared (Fig. 10). In the absence of chloride, EPO produced a higher yield of bromamine than MPO at low bromide concentrations. At high bromide (1-10 mM), both MPO and EPO produced 1 mol of bromamine/mol of H2O2. With 100 mM chloride, MPO produced 1 mol of oxidant/mol of H2O2 regardless of the bromide concentration. As shown below, the oxidants were mixtures of chloramines and bromamines. The yield was low with EPO, 100 mM chloride, and no bromide, but approached 1 mol/mol of H2O2 when bromide was present. No stable oxidants were obtained in the absence of an amine to trap HOCl/OCl- and HOBr/OBr-. MPO and EPO were incubated with 100 mM chloride, various concentrations of bromide, 0.1 mM H2O2, and 100 mM taurine. Absorption spectra of the stable oxidants were measured (Fig. 11). In the absence of bromide, only the 252 nm peak of the mono-chloramine was observed. As bromide was increased, the spectra spread and shifted, and the 288 nm peak of the mono-bromamine was observed. For comparison, the spectra obtained with 10 mM bromide and no chloride are shown. Concentrations of the chloramine and bromamine were calculated from the 252 and 288 nm absorbance. With MPO, the mixtures of oxidants obtained with 100 mM chloride and 0.1, 1, and 10 mM bromide contained 6, 30, and 83% bromamine. With EPO, the mixtures contained 88, 93, and 95% bromamine. Assuming a variation of 0.001 absorbance unit at each wavelength, the accuracy was ±4%. Similar results were obtained with an independent method, making use of the ability of H2O2 to reduce bromamines but not chloramines. MPO and EPO (0.1 μM) were incubated with 100 mM chloride, various concentrations of bromide, 0.1 mM H2O2, and 100 mM taurine for 30 min at 37°C. The enzymes were removed by passing the incubation mixtures through centrifugal ultra-filters with a 30 kDa cut-off (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Portions of the filtrates were incubated with and without excess H2O2 (0.2 mM) for 30 min at 37°C. Catalase was added, and then concentrations of the oxidants were measured with Nbs. With MPO, the mixtures obtained with 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mM bromide contained 6, 8, 30, 55, and 70% bromamine. With EPO, the mixtures contained 78, 82, 82, 95, and 95% bromamine. The standard error of replicate determinations was ±5 μM, or 5% of the total oxidant. Bromide was preferred over chloride as a substrate for both MPO and EPO, although the preference was stronger with EPO. For example, when chloride was 100 mM and bromide was 1 mM, MPO used 0.07 mM H2O2 in chloride oxidation and 0.03 mM H2O2 in bromide oxidation, indicating a 40-fold preference for bromide. EPO used 0.01 mM H2O2 in chloride oxidation and 0.09 mM H2O2 in bromide oxidation, indicating a 1000-fold preference for bromide. Both enzymes produced a mixture of oxidants at physiologic levels of bromide (0.1 mM) and chloride (100 mM). When the enzymes were incubated with H2O2 and both bromide and chloride, trapping of HOCl/OCl- by high levels of an amine prevented the non-enzymatic oxidation of bromide to HOBr/OBr-. The reaction of HOCl/OCl- with the amine to form chloramines was faster than the oxidation of bromide by HOCl/OCl-, and chloramines did not oxidize bromide under the conditions of these experiments, all at neutral pH. Chloramines also did not undergo detectable exchange with bromide within 1 h at 37°C. Therefore, the composition of the mixtures of chloramines and bromamines provided a direct measure of the amounts of chloride and bromide that were oxidized by the enzymes. Chloramines and bromamines could be quantified from their characteristic absorption spectra and by selective reduction of the bromamines with H2O2. Trapping oxidized forms of bromide with high levels of amines also prevented the reduction of HOBr/OBr- by H2O2. The reaction of HOBr/OBr- with amines to form bromamines was much faster than the reduction of HOBr/OBr- by H2O2 when the amine/bromide ratio was 100:1 or higher. Although bromamines were reduced by H2O2, reduction of bromamines was much slower than reduction of HOBr/OBr-. All of the H2O2 was consumed in bromide oxidation before reduction of bromamines could occur, and 1 mol of bromamine was produced per mol of H2O2. At low amine concentrations, trapping of HOBr/OBr- was less effective, and the major product was the di-bromamine, which reacted faster than the mono-bromamine with H2O2. Substantial reduction of HOBr/OBr- and bromamines was observed when the amine concentration was less than 10 mM. When no amine was present, bromide was oxidized to HOBr/OBr-, and HOBr/OBr- was reduced by H2O2. No oxidant accumulated in the medium, and 1 mol of O2 was produced per 2 mol of H2O2. MPO and EPO were not inactivated under these conditions, indicating that the enzymes were not readily inactivated by HOBr/OBr- or that rapid reduction of HOBr/OBr- by H2O2 protected the enzymes against inactivation. The enzymes were also not readily inactivated by singlet oxygen, which should have been produced under these conditions. When no chloride was present and bromide was less than 1 mM, MPO produced less than 1 mol of bromamine/mol of H2O2, despite the presence of high levels of amine. Under these conditions, MPO was converted to the Compound II form, which underwent further irreversible inactivation by the excess H2O2. EPO appeared to be less likely to be converted to the Compound II form and was able to produce 1 mol of bromamine/mol of H2O2 at bromide concentrations as low as 0.1 mM. Trapping HOBr/OBr- with taurine had advantages compared with other methods that have been used to detect products of bromide oxidation. For example, proteins (8Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M.

Med. 1990; 71: 2025-2041Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have been used as traps for brominating agents. Proteins contain reactive groups such as the thioether portion of methionine residues that are readily oxidized by halogenating agents, but which do not yield stable halogenated products. Aromatic compounds must be used at low concentrations to avoid problems with solubility, toxicity, or interference in peroxidase-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, these compounds may trap only a small portion of the brominating agents that are formed, and may not be able to prevent the non-enzymatic oxidation of bromide by HOCl/OCl-. Under physiologic conditions, concentrations of ammonia, amine compounds, and protein amino groups are very high. Trapping of HOCl/OCl- by these nitrogen compounds should prevent the non-enzymatic oxidation of bromide. However, non-enzymatic oxidation may occur in experiments with isolated leukocytes. Secretion of MPO by neutrophils and the release of H2O2 into the extracellular medium result in chloride oxidation in the medium(45Test S.T. Weiss S.J. Adv. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1986; 2: 91-116Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If both chloride and bromide are present and no amine is added as a trap for HOCl/OCl-, the nitrogen compounds released into the medium by the cells (46Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10404-10413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may not be adequate to prevent the non-enzymatic oxidation of bromide by HOCl/OCl-. Trapping of HOBr/OBr- by high levels of ammonia and amines in vivo may also prevent the reduction of HOBr/OBr- and bromamines by H2O2. However, the amount of nitrogen compounds released by isolated leukocytes may not be adequate. Even when excess amine is added, H2O2 may reduce HOBr/OBr- and bromamines if the activity of secreted peroxidase enzymes in the medium is low and the rate of H2O2 production is greater than the rate at which H2O2 is consumed in bromide oxidation. Similarly, if the amount of H2O2 produced exceeds the amount of bromide, oxidation of bromide will stop as bromide is depleted, and the excess H2O2 may reduce bromamines that were produced before bromide was depleted. In studies with isolated leukocytes, evidence for the formation of brominating agents was obtained(8Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S. Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 9Mayeno A.N. Curran A.J. Roberts R.L. Foote C.S. J. Biol.

Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Reduction of HOBr/OBr- and bromamines by H2O2 may account for these results. If reduction of HOBr/OBr- and bromamines does occur, then bromide should appear to inhibit leukocyte O2 uptake because the peroxidase and bromide catalyze the formation of up to 1 mol of O2/2 mol of H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W2059510815,"In an attempt to define the basis for sphingolipid regulation of cell proliferation, we studied the effects of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase inhibition by threo1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) on NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors. PDMP treatment resulted in a time-dependent decrease in GlcCer levels and an increase in cellular ceramide levels. PDMP abolished serum and IGF-1-stimulated cell proliferation, as measured by a reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation, protein, and DNA levels. However it did not affect IGF-1-mediated early signaling events, including receptor tyrosine kinase, MAP kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities. Two-color flow cytometry with propidium iodide and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine monophosphate labeling revealed an arrest of the cell cycle at G1/S and G2/M transitions in an asynchronous population of cells. These changes were time dependent, with maximal effects seen by 12-24 h. Removal of PDMP from the cell medium resulted in reversal of the cell cycle changes, with cells re-entering the S phase. The cell cycle arrest at the G1/S and G2/M transitions was confirmed in cells synchronized by pretreatment with nocodazole, aphidicolin, or hydroxyurea, and released from blockade in the presence of PDMP. A decrease in the activities of two cyclin-dependent kinases, p34cdc2 kinase and cdk2 kinase, was observed with PDMP treatment. When cell ceramide levels were increased by N-acetylsphingosine, comparable changes in the cell cycle distribution were seen. However, sphingomyelinase treatment was without effect. Therefore, it appears that ceramide mediates in part the inhibitory effect of GlcCer synthase inhibition on IGF-1-induced cell proliferation in 3T3 cells. The rapid production of decreased cyclin-dependent kinase activities by PDMP suggests that one of the crucial sites of action of the inhibitor lies in this area.

We observed that treatment of 3T3 cells with the GlcCer synthase inhibitor abolished the proliferative response to either IGF-1 or serum. We also observed that PDMP did not affect early signal transduction events in response to serum or IGF-1, but it did block cell cycle progression in association with an inhibition of cell cycle-dependent kinases.

These cultures provided the asynchronous population of cells. Eighteen to 24 h prior to IGF-1 treatment, cells were growth arrested by replacement with the same medium, containing low serum (0.5%). IGF-1 was dissolved in the medium and added to cultures, while PDMP was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, dried under nitrogen, and reconstituted in medium by sonication prior to addition to cultures.

The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at the University of Michigan Cancer Center's core facility. Cells were washed twice with 8 ml of cold PBS, scraped from Petri dishes with 2 ml of cold methanol, and transferred to screw cap tubes. Chloroform (2 ml) was added, and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was reextracted with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and the supernatants were pooled.

The lower layer was transferred to a glass tube, dried under nitrogen, and used for measuring ceramide and GlcCer levels. Ceramide was measured by spotting lipid extracts and ceramide standards (0.2-2.0 μg) on thin layer chromatography plates and separating with chloroform/acetic acid (9:1).

Following the experimental treatments, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). After 30 min on ice, the cell extracts were clarified by centrifuging 10 min at 14,500 × g at 4°C. Protein was determined with the Bio-Rad DC reagent, and kinase activity was measured using 20-30 μg of lysate protein in a reaction mixture consisting of 1 mM peptide substrate in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, and 100 μM ATP (1-2 μCi) in a total volume of 30 μl. After a 10-min incubation at 30°C, 10% trichloroacetic acid was added and, after brief centrifugation, a 10-μl aliquot of the supernatant was applied to phosphocellulose paper discs. The disks were washed with 2 liters of 1% phosphoric acid and twice with water, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. The appropriate blanks (counts/minute in the absence of enzyme and substrate peptide) were deducted from the total counts/minute, and the activity expressed as pmol of 32P/mg protein.

Cell lysates were prepared as described above for the assay of p34cdc2 kinase activity. Equal amounts of lysate protein (200 μg) were incubated with 2.5 μg of antibody for 1 h or overnight at 4°C. A 30-μl aliquot of Protein A Plus/Protein G-agarose suspension was added and agitated for 1 h at 4°C. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 4 min at 4°C. The beads were washed twice with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 and three times with kinase buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. After removal of the last supernatant, the agarose pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of a reaction mixture consisting of 40 μg of histone H1, 25 μM ATP (2.5 μCi), and 10 mM MgCl2 in the kinase buffer, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. A 15-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted on phosphocellulose discs and the discs washed as described above. Another aliquot was used for measuring histone H1 phosphorylation, using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For this, 15 μl of the reaction mix was boiled with Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on a 12% gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and dried and the phosphorylated histone visualized by autoradiography. The lysates prepared as described for the kinase activity assay were mixed with 1 × Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on 12% gel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to poly(vinylidine fluoride) membranes as recommended by the manufacturer. The blots were first incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and probed with anti-cdk2 or anti-cdc2 kinase antibodies. The immune complexes were detected using the ECL reagents or 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (ICN) and quantitated by video densitometry as above. Northern analysis was performed as described previously(28Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Asynchronously growing 3T3 cells were treated for indicated periods with or without PDMP. The total cell RNA was isolated using the Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA was dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantitated by spectrometry as well as quantitative agarose gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts of total RNA were denatured in formaldehyde and formamide, fractionated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, and transferred to BA-S nitrocellulose membranes. The RNA was then hybridized to an [α-32P]dCTP randomly labeled 283-base pair cdc2 cDNA fragment. This probe was generated by reverse transcribed-PCR from 3T3 cells using primers 5′-GGC ACC ATA TTT GCT GAA CTA GC-3′ and 3′-CGG TTT TAC CGT GAC TTA GTA GG-5′, subsequently cloned into Invitrogen PCR II vector by TA cloning and verified by DNA sequencing(29Lee M.G. Nurse P. Nature. 1987; 327: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). After overnight hybridization, the membranes were washed in high stringency conditions (twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1 × SDS at room temperature for 15 min each, twice with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1 × SDS at 55°C for 30 min each), air dried, and the hybridization bands were visualized by autoradiography. As an internal control to assure equal RNA loading, the membranes were stripped and rehybridized with 139-base pair glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment as described above. This probe was generated by reverse transcribed-PCR from 3T3 cells using primers 5′-ATA TGA ATT CTC CAT GGT GGT GAA G-3′ and 5′-ATG GGA AGC TTG TCA TCA-3′, also cloned into Invitrogen PCR II vector by TA cloning and verified by DNA sequencing(30Rappolee D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). All DNA fragments were labeled using the Prime-a-Gene kit. The hybridization bands on the autoradiograms were quantitated by video densitometry. The inclusion in medium of 10% serum or 10 nM IGF-1 for 18 h to serum-deprived cells markedly stimulated DNA synthesis, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The addition of 20 μM PDMP inhibited both the basal and growth factor-stimulated thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1). The effect of PDMP was dose dependent, with an observed IC50 of 15 μM for both IGF-1 and serum-stimulated proliferation. Some inhibition was seen with PDMP concentrations as low as 5 μM. PDMP also decreased cell protein and DNA content/dish, as previously reported in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (16Shayman J.A. Deshmukh G.D. Mahdiyoun S. Thomas T.P. Wu D. Barcelon F.S. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22968-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time dependence of the inhibition of cell proliferation by the GlcCer synthase inhibitor was assessed by delaying exposure of the cells to inhibitor following the addition of IGF-1. PDMP inhibited IGF-1-stimulated thymidine incorporation, and the extent of inhibition was attenuated as the duration of exposure to PDMP was shortened (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with the interpretation that the anti-proliferative effect of PDMP is the result of secondary metabolic effects and not due to the inhibitor itself. Important steps in the cascade of early signaling events following IGF-1 binding are the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase, MAP kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-kinase). Cells were growth arrested by serum deprivation, treated for 18 h with or without 50 μM PDMP, and then incubated with or without 10 nM IGF-1 for 5 or 30 min. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor was examined by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The stimulation by IGF-1 of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 97-kDa IGF-1 receptor β subunit was unaffected by PDMP (Fig. 3). Other proteins demonstrating increased phosphorylation with IGF-1 stimulation were similarly unaffected. Similarly, 24 h of pretreatment with 50 μM PDMP had no discernible effect on IGF-1 stimulation of MAP kinase (Fig. 4 A) and PI-3-kinase (Fig. 4B) activities. These results clearly indicated that these initial events in growth factor action were not altered by PDMP pretreatment. The cell cycle progression of WT-3T3 cells exposed to the GlcCer synthase inhibitor was analyzed by flow cytometric analysis of DNA synthesis by BrdU incorporation and DNA content by propidium iodide-staining. Three distinct cell populations corresponding to G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were readily observed in an asynchronously growing population of untreated cells (Fig. 5A). Twenty-four h following exposure to 50 μM PDMP, marked and reproducible decreases in the percent of cells in the S phase and increases in the percent of cells in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle were observed (Fig. 5B). The cell cycle blockade by PDMP was reversed by incubating the cells in inhibitor-free culture medium for 24 h. This resulted in cell cycle redistribution with an increase in the percentage of S phase cells and a decrease in G2/M cells (Fig. 5C). The time dependence of the PDMP effect on cell cycle arrest in asynchronously growing cells was studied. A time-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in G2/M with a concomitant decrease in cells in the S phase was observed (Fig. 6A). These changes occurred in a parallel manner consistent with a block at both G1/S and G2/M. PDMP treatment for as little as 2 h resulted in significant changes in the distribution of cells. The peak effect was observed by 12 h with the percentage of cells in the G2/M phases increasing by >40% and the percentage of cells in the S phase decreasing by >50%. Cellular levels of ceramide and GlcCer were measured in parallel cultures treated similarly. A representative thin layer chromatography plate showing the separation of these lipids is shown in Fig. 7. The presence of N-acetylsphingosine can be seen in cells treated with this C2-ceramide in both solvent systems, demonstrating its cellular incorporation. Time-dependent increases in cell ceramide were observed, with levels increasing more than 3-fold by 24 h (Fig. 6B). GlcCer levels decreased by greater than 70% at 24 h. These changes in sphingolipid levels were consistent with the well-characterized ability of PDMP to inhibit GlcCer synthesis(15Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Inokuchi J. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 183-213PubMed Google Scholar). Cell protein/dish over the same time period decreased as well (not shown). The apparent correlation between PDMP-induced cell cycle arrest and increased ceramide levels was examined further. Cells were treated with cell-permeable short chain ceramide, N-acetylsphingosine, or with sphingomyelinase. Both treatments significantly increased the levels of endogenous ceramides (Fig. 7) to levels comparable to those observed with PDMP treatment. Exposure of cells to 10 μMN-acetylsphingosine resulted in an increase in the fraction of cells in G2-M but did not decrease the fraction in S phase. However, sphingomyelinase failed to mimic the cell cycle effects of PDMP (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The possible association between cell cycle block and increased ceramide levels was examined further in synchronized cells (Fig. 8, A and B). Cells were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation and then stimulated with 10 nM IGF-1. Treatment with IGF-1 for 18 h resulted in an almost 4-fold increase of cells in S phase, with a concomitant reduction in G0/G1 phase, and a small, but significant increase in G2/M cells. Addition of PDMP with IGF-1 blocked the increase in S phase cells, the majority of cells being arrested in G0/G1. Neither N-acetylsphingosine nor sphingomyelinase treatment inhibited entry of cells into the S phase. In contrast to the asynchronously growing cells, the G2/M population displayed no significant difference in the presence or absence of PDMP or N-acetylsphingosine. The effect of newly described inhibitors of GlcCer synthase on the cell cycle distribution was also determined. BML-130 is the DL-analog of threo-PDMP in which pyrrolidine and palmitic acid substitute for the morphiline and decanoic acid groups, respectively(31Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipken R.E. Rivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). IV-231B is the D-enantiomer of an analog of BML-130 in which the benzene ring has been replaced by the alkenyl chain of sphingosine(32Carson K.G. Ganem B. Radin N.S. Abe A. Shayman J.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 2659-2662Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The latter compound inhibits GlcCer synthase, depleting cells of GlcCer, but does not result in ceramide accumulation(31Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipken R.E. Rivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). Treatment with each inhibitor resulted in the accumulation of cells in G2/M; however, only PDMP treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Several agents arrest growth at specific stages of cell cycle. Growth synchronization can be achieved following release from this blockade. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on cells treated with three cell cycle blockers (Fig. 9). A 16 h treatment with aphidicolin (4 μM) or hydroxyurea (10 mM) arrested cells in G0/G1, with 85-90% cells in that stage (Fig. 9, panels B and C). Treatment with 2.5 μM nocodazole blocked cell cycle progression in G2/M, as shown by the high proportion (90%) of cells in that stage (Fig. 9, panel D). The cell cycle distribution was studied when cells were released from this blockade in the presenc"

Because SOD1 is a homodimeric enzyme, dimerization of mutant and wild-type SOD1 subunits could dominantly alter the activity, stability, or localization of wild-type SOD1 subunits. To explore these possibilities, we used transient and stable gene transfection to express high levels of either of two mutant human SOD1 subunits in the presence of limited levels of wild-type mouse and/or human SOD1 subunits. Although both mutant subunits displayed diminished half-lives and free radical scavenging activities, their presence caused no change in the half-life or activity of wild-type SOD1 subunits. Our data indicate that mutant subunits do not dominantly affect the function of wild-type SOD1 subunits. These findings, together with observations that many mutant SOD1 subunits retain significant stability and activity, suggest that motor neuron damage in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is caused by the acquisition of injurious properties by mutant SOD1 subunits.

The interactions between the subunits of purified homodimeric SOD1 are very stable in vitro(11Fridovich I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

However, a recent study reported that one line of transgenic mice expressing an FALS-linked human (Hu) SOD1 mutant develop motor neuron disease, despite elevated levels of total SOD1 activity(15Gurney M.E.

Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Since expression of wild-type HuSOD1 at high levels does not cause motor neuron disease, the simplest interpretation of these data is that the mechanism by which mutant subunits cause motor neuron death involves an acquisition of injurious properties. However, it is important to note that disease was absent in transgenic mice expressing the codon 4 (Ala → Val) FALS variant of HuSOD1, despite robust transgene expression(15Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.-X. Chen W. Zhai P. Sufit R.L. Siddique T. Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar). As the Ala → Val mutation diminishes both the half-life and specific activity of the mutant enzyme subunit(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), it is possible that where mutations do not substantially diminish enzyme activity or longevity, the mechanism of motor neuron degeneration involves a gain of injurious property by the mutant enzyme, whereas when enzyme function is severely compromised, it is a loss of free radical scavenging activity which underlies disease. Indeed, the chronic inhibition of SOD1 in rat spinal cord organotypic cultures causes apoptotic death of neurons(16Rothstein J.D. Bristol L.A. Hosler B. Brown Jr., R.H. Kuncl R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4155-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). If loss of SOD1 activity underlies disease in those SOD1-linked FALS cases in which the activity or half-life of the mutant enzyme is severely compromised, then it remains possible that dimerization of mutant subunits with wild-type subunits causes a diminution in the activity and/or stability of wild-type subunits and that this phenomenon is an important factor in disease. To test whether mutant SOD1 subunits can affect the activity or stability of wild-type subunits, we used transient and stable transfection of primate and murine cells to express high levels of mutant HuSOD1 subunits in the presence of wild-type mouse (Mo) or Hu SOD1 subunits to favor the dimerization of newly synthesized wild-type subunits with newly synthesized mutant subunits. For these studies, we selected two mutants (G41D and G85R) that possess little or no activity and markedly diminished polypeptide half-life(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Because SOD1 dimers are very stable molecules in vitro(11Fridovich I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1986; 58: 61-97PubMed Google Scholar, 17Epstein C.J. Avraham K.B. Lovett M. Smith S. Elroy-Stein O. Rotman G. Bry C. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that newly synthesized SOD1 subunits might dimerize shortly after synthesis and remain associated until degradation of the dimer. However, our data indicate that, in one case (HuSOD1-G85R), mutant SOD1 subunits do not form stable dimers with wild-type SOD1 subunits. More importantly, in the other case (HuSOD1-G41D), mutant and wild-type subunits readily dissociated and exchanged in vivo. These data indicate that even severely compromised SOD1 mutants lack the ability to influence the activity or longevity of wild-type SOD1 subunits. The FALS-linked G41D mutation was introduced, by polymerase chain reaction strategies, into a plasmid clone of the human genomic sod-1 gene (pHGSOD-SVneo), which contains the entire human sod-1 gene within a 14-kilobase DNA fragment flanked by EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites(17Epstein C.J. Avraham K.B. Lovett M. Smith S. Elroy-Stein O. Rotman G. Bry C. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-kilobase PstI-XbaI restriction endonuclease fragment of human sod-1 DNA, which encompasses all of exon 2, was excised and subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene Inc, La Jolla, CA). The G41D mutation was then introduced using a three-primer polymerase chain reaction involving a mutated synthetic oligonucleotide that spans codon 41 and two primers that are complementary to sequences in the plasmid vector. The amplified product was digested with PstI and XbaI and inserted into pBluescript. Plasmids carrying mutated sequences were initially identified by restriction enzyme digestion (the G41D mutation destroys a StuI restriction endonuclease site), with additional confirmation by nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire exon 2 and flanking mRNA splicing signals. The complete gene was reassembled by ligating an NdeI-XbaI subfragment of the mutant plasmid with EcoRI-NdeI and XbaI-EcoRI fragments of the parent pHGSOD-SVneo plasmid in a three-way ligation. The integrity of the reassembled plasmids was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion. The wild-type and mutant HuSOD1 cDNA expression plasmids used in this study have been described previously(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H.

Two cultured cell lines were used for transient and stable gene transfection studies. In COS-1 cells, previously described pEF-BOS expression plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant human SOD1 cDNAs were used(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C.

Transient transfection was performed using methods described by Chen and Okayama(18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). In experiments to coexpress wild-type and mutant HuSOD1, expression plasmids were mixed at a ratio of 1:5 (wild-type to mutant). As a control, wild-type HuSOD1 expression plasmid was mixed (1:5) with a pEF-BOS expression plasmid that codes for a deletion mutant of human APP695 comprising the NH2-terminal 22 codons and the COOH-terminal 104 codons of the human (Alzheimer) amyloid precursor protein. Experimental manipulations, such as metabolic radiolabeling or analysis of SOD1 activity, on these transiently transfected COS-1 cells were carried out 48 h after transfection. Stably transfected lines of mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were derived by selection with the drug G418, following transfection (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) with the wild-type and mutant (G41D) pHGSOD-SVneo plasmids described above. The pHGSOD-SVneo plasmid contains a 3-kilobase fragment that contains a transcription unit for the gene that confers resistance to the neomycin analog G418(19Elroy-Stein O. Bernstein Y. Groner Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Colonies were screened for expression of wild-type and mutant HuSOD1 by metabolic radiolabeling for 20 min with [3535S]cysteine and immunoprecipitation with SOD1 antibodies as described(14Borchelt D.R.

To assess the level of SOD1 free radical scavenging activity, extracts of cells were prepared by freeze-thaw lysis in 0.125 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, with 20% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and SOD1 activities were determined as described previously(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 20Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). The half-lives of SOD1 polypeptides were measured by pulse-chase metabolic radiolabeling with [3535S]cysteine, followed by immunoprecipitation of labeled SOD1, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation, and PhosphorImaging. In transiently transfected COS-1 cells, a single mixture of wild-type or mutant SOD1 encoding DNA was transfected into a 60-mm dish of COS-1 cells using the reagent DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) or the methods of Chen and Okayama(18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were split into four replicate 2-cm dishes. After an additional 24 h, the cells were labeled, and SOD1 polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with either of two previously described polyclonal antisera raised against intact erythrocyte HuSOD1 polypeptide, or a synthetic HuSOD1 peptide (amino acids 125-137; DDLGKGGNEESTK), which is completely identical in MoSOD1 and HuSOD1(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Both antisera gave identical results. The SOD1(125-137) peptide antiserum recognized both HuSOD1 and MoSOD1, with only weak reactivity for COS-1 SOD1, whereas the antiserum to erythrocyte HuSOD1 recognized all three species of SOD1. The immunoreactivity of these antisera was fully competed by excess peptide or whole protein, respectively (not shown). Immunoprecipitated polypeptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. Radiolabeled SOD1 polypeptide bands were quantified with a Molecular Dynamics (Mountain View, CA) PhosphorImager. To estimate half-lives of the wild-type HuSOD1 and each mutant, the percent of radiolabeled SOD1 polypeptides remaining in the cells after a given period of chase was plotted on a log10 scale and fit to a curve with the assumption that degradation follows first-order kinetics (Cricket Graph III, Computer Associates International, Inc.). Naive COS-1 cells were lifted from culture dishes by treatment with 5 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min then resuspended in 5-10 volumes (packed cells) of deionized water. The cells were lysed by two cycles of freeze-thaw. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was adjusted to 10 mM NaPO4, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM KPO4, and 140 mM NaCl. The supernatant was divided into 30-μl portions, and 200 ng of purified human erythrocyte SOD1 (Sigma) was added. After varied periods of time at 37°C, the reactions were chilled to 4°C and loaded onto SOD1 assay gels. To determine whether mutant subunits can affect the activity or stability of wild-type SOD1 subunits, we focused on two previously characterized mutants (G41D and G85R), which display diminished specific activity (50 and 100% reduction) and polypeptide half-life (60 and 70% reduction)(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Each mutation substitutes a charged amino acid for uncharged glycine, altering the rate of electrophoretic migration of the dimeric holoenzyme on SOD1 assay gels(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Transient expression of wild-type and mutant (G37R and G41D) HuSOD1 in COS-1 cells yielded novel free radical scavenging activities in such assay gels (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3, filled and open arrowheads, HuSOD1 homodimer and human/monkey heterodimer, respectively); no activity could be detected for HuSOD1-G85R (lane 4), as noted in a previous study(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that cotransfection of two unlinked plasmids yielded coexpression in each transfected cell, plasmids encoding wild-type and G37R HuSOD1 were mixed, transfected, and SOD1 activity assessed by the gel assay (Fig. 1, lane 5). Previous studies of lymphoblasts from heterozygous FALS (G37R) individuals demonstrated the ability of HuSOD1-G37R subunits to heterodimerize with wild-type subunits(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The appearance of activities (lane 5, open arrow) that migrate between homodimeric wild-type HuSOD1 (filled arrow) and homodimeric HuSOD1-G37R (filled arrowhead) in these assay gels clearly establishes that mutant and wild-type expression plasmids enter cells simultaneously and are coexpressed, yielding heterodimeric wild-type/G37R HuSOD1(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Activities with the mobility of mutant and wild-type human SOD1 heterodimers were also detected after cotransfection of wild-type and G41D HuSOD1 expression plasmids (lane 6, open arrow). Heterodimers of human and monkey SOD1 (open arrowheads) were detected in all transfections. We focused initially on the G85R subunit, reasoning that if the inactive G85R subunit could stably combine with wild-type SOD1, then the combination of the G85R charge variant subunit with active wild-type subunits should create a novel species of activity (like that observed for G37R and wild-type subunits in lane 5, open arrow). Alternatively, the mutant subunit could diminish (or eliminate) the activity of the wild-type subunit when present in heterodimers. Neither of these outcomes was observed as the only active enzyme we detected in cotransfections of G85R and wild-type (lane 7) comigrated with the wild-type enzyme generated in control transfections (lane 8). Moreover, the level of wild-type HuSOD1 homodimer activity was undiminished (compare lanes 7 and 8) even when five times more G85R expression plasmid, relative to wild-type expression plasmid, was used in the transfection mixture. Metabolic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that the synthetic rate of G85R subunits in these experiments exceeded that of wild-type subunits by 3-4-fold (Fig. 2). After cotransfection with wild-type SOD1 and G85R HuSOD1, the cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [3535S]cysteine for 20 min and then incubated in unlabeled medium for varied periods followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation with SOD1 antiserum. As the G85R SOD1 subunits display accelerated electrophoretic migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis relative to wild-type polypeptides (14; Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 5) the synthetic rate of HuSOD1-G85R wild-type subunits could easily be determined. PhosphorImaging showed that the synthesis of mutant subunits exceeded the rate of wild-type subunits by 3-4-fold (Fig. 2, lane 9). Further analysis of labeled SOD1 remaining in cells after incubation in unlabeled medium demonstrated that the degradation of the G85R and wild-type polypeptides followed independent kinetics (lanes 9-12), with each displaying a half-life indistinguishable from that of each individual polypeptide when expressed alone (lanes 1-8). Data from two determinations are displayed graphically below the figure. Previous studies have established that Hu- and MoSOD1 form active heterodimers(17Epstein C.J. Avraham K.B. Lovett M. Smith S. Elroy-Stein O. Rotman G. Bry C. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 19Elroy-Stein O. Bernstein Y. Groner Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To examine interactions between HuSOD1-G41D subunits and wild-type SOD1, we stably transfected mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells with a ~14-kilobase human genomic DNA fragment, contained within the plasmid pHGSOD-SVneo (17Epstein C.J. Avraham K.B. Lovett M. Smith S. Elroy-Stein O. Rotman G. Bry C. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 19Elroy-Stein O. Bernstein Y. Groner Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) encoding either wild-type SOD1 or a gene mutated to encode HuSOD1-G41D. Mutant and wild-type pHGSOD-SVneo plasmids yielded a similar number of G418-resistant colonies. Cloned cell lines were screened by metabolic radiolabeling with [3535S]cysteine and immunoprecipitation with SOD1 antiserum to identify cultures in which the synthetic rate of human polypeptides exceeded that of mouse polypeptides (MoSOD1 and HuSOD1 possess 3 and 4 cysteines, respectively). For wild-type HuSOD1, a clone was identified in which the synthetic rate of human polypeptide was three to four times greater than mouse polypeptide (Fig. 3, lane 2). For G41D HuSOD1, a colony was isolated in which the human polypeptide was synthesized at two to three times the rate of mouse polypeptide (Fig. 3, lane 6). In cells expressing wild-type HuSOD1, both MoSOD1 and HuSOD1 polypeptides possessed half-lives of ≥ 48 h (Fig. 3, lanes 2-5). In contrast, the half-life of the HuG41D mutant was ≤ 7 h, but the half-life of the MoSOD1 remained ≥ 48 h (Fig. 3, lanes 6-9). To determine whether HuSOD1(G41D) and MoSOD1 subunits form heterodimers as seen in previous transfection assays with wild-type HuSOD1(17Epstein C.J. Avraham K.B. Lovett M. Smith S. Elroy-Stein O.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), extracts of N2a cells expressing wild-type or G41D SOD1 were analyzed by gel assay. In cells expressing the wild-type HuSOD1, nearly all MoSOD1 subunits appeared to be heterodimerized with human SOD1 subunits (Fig. 4, lane 2, open arrow)(17Epstein C.J. Avraham K.B. Lovett M. Smith S. Elroy-Stein O. Rotman G. Bry C. Groner Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 19Elroy-Stein O. Bernstein Y. Groner Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of homodimeric MoSOD1 in cells expressing the G41D mutant (lane 3) was comparable to that of the parental N2a cells (lane 1) despite the high rate of HuSOD1-G41D synthesis (see above). Although the short half-life of HuSOD1-G41D subunits precluded the accumulation of significant levels of activity, low levels of heterodimeric Hu-G41D/MoSOD1 (lane 4, open arrowhead) and homodimeric HuSOD1-G41D (lane 4, filled arrowhead) could be detected. To our knowledge, the dissociation constant of SOD1 subunits is unknown; however, one study has documented the slow exchange of SOD1 subunits in physiologic buffers at 0°C(22Malinowski D.P. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of SOD1 subunit exchange at physiologically relevant temperatures, lysates of COS-1 cells (prepared by freeze-thaw in water followed by phosphate and saline buffering) were mixed with purified erythrocyte HuSOD1. Within 10 min at 37°C, heterodimeric SOD1 activities (Fig. 5, lane 4) with mobility intermediate between homodimeric HuSOD1 and homodimeric COS-1 SOD1 could be detected. The amount of heterodimeric activity increased steadily with time, up to 2 h (Fig. 5, lane 7, open arrow). These data indicate that SOD1 subunits are capable of rapid exchange. In the present study, we demonstrate that the half-lives and free radical scavenging activities of wild-type SOD1 subunits are unaltered in settings in which the rate of mutant (FALS) SOD1 subunit synthesis substantially exceeds that of wild-type subunits. Although both mutants we examined display markedly diminished half-life with reduced specific activity (14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) (and thus, when heterodimerized, are good candidates to diminish wild-type subunit activity or stability), neither was found to affect the half-life or activity of wild-type subunits. Whether mutant SOD1 subunits can affect the activity or stability of mutant subunits is largely dependent upon the stability of the dimeric interaction and the relative concentration of each subunit. Because our data indicate that SOD1 subunits exchange rapidly and that mutant subunits are relatively short lived, it becomes nearly impossible for mutant subunits to affect either the activity or stability of wild-type subunits. At equilibrium, a newly synthesized wild-type subunit will have a greater likelihood of dimerizing with a preexisting wild-type subunit (which will be in greater concentration) than a newly synthesized mutant subunit. The present data suggest that the mechanism underlying dominant inheritance of FALS does not involve a diminution of wild-type SOD1 subunit half-life or free radical scavenging activity as a result of heterodimerization with mutant subunits. Thus for any heterozygous FALS individual with a mutation in SOD1, the level of remaining SOD1 activity will be at least 50% of normal. Combined with the finding that some FALS SOD1 mutants retain wild-type activity and significant stability(14Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.-S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), we conclude that it is unlikely that a partial loss of free radical scavenging activity underlies motor neuron degeneration in FALS. The simplest interpretation of the biochemical data described here is that the dominant character of SOD1-linked FALS is due to a gain of some injurious property by mutant SOD1 subunits. Motor neuron disease in transgenic mice expressing the FALS variant HuSOD1-G93A, in which a 3-fold increase in total SOD1 activity levels was observed (15Gurney M.E. Pu H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C. Polchow C.Y. Alexander D.D. Caliendo J. Hentati A. Kwon Y.W. Deng H.-X. Chen W. Zhai P. Sufit R.L. Siddique T. Science. 1994; 264: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar), offers further support for this conclusion, as does motor neuron disease in transgenic mice expressing the stable and active G37R FALS SOD1 mutant.2 The key questions that remain unresolved are the nature of the gained injurious property(ies) and the basis for the apparent selective targeting of motor neurons. These uncertainties leave open additional possibilities, including one in which wild-type SOD1 possesses activities beyond free radical catabolism in motor neurons and that it is these activities that are most severely diminished by FALS-linked mutations. If SOD1 possesses alternative functions, then it remains possible that interactions between mutant and wild-type subunits, however transient, are sufficient to alter some aspect of wild-type SOD1 function. Examples of this type of process include the URE2 gene product in yeast, where a conformationally altered form of URE2 interacts with wild-type URE2, causing conformational changes that diminish function(23Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Other examples of these phenomena include the p53 oncogene where dimerization of mutant and wild-type p53 subunits causes the wild-type subunit to acquire the nonfunctional conformation of mutant subunits(24Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Both of these mechanisms share features with the apparent mechanism of prion replication(25Weissmann C. Science. 1994; 264: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Cohen F.E. Pan K.-M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that mutant subunits do not alter the free radical scavenging activity of wild-type subunits. The absence of evidence for alternative SOD1 functions or activities favors the idea that rather than loss of free radical scavenging (or other) activities, mutant SOD1 subunits cause motor neuron degeneration by gain of as yet undefined deleterious properties. We thank Dr. Shigekazu Nagata for graciously providing the pEF-BOS expression plasmid and Dr. Yoram Groner for providing the pHGSOD-SVneo plasmid."

https://openalex.org/W2071115409,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are multifunctional peptides intimately involved in the process of extracellular matrix remodeling. We recently showed that TGF-β stimulates the human α2(I) collagen gene by increasing the affinity of an Sp1-containing transcriptional complex bound to an upstream sequence termed the TbRE (Inagaki, Y., Truter, S. and Ramirez, F.(1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 269, 14828-14834). Here, we report that the TbRE-bound complex also mediates the inhibitory signal of TNF-α. Nuclear proteins from cells treated with TNF-α bind to the TbRE sequence substantially more strongly than those from untreated cells. Additionally, TNF-α increases binding of a second protein complex that recognizes the negatively <i>cis</i>-acting element located immediately next to the TbRE. Thus, we postulate that TNF-α counteracts the TGF-β-elicited stimulation of collagen gene expression through overlapping nuclear signaling pathways. One modifies the TGF-β-targeted transcriptional complex, probably by reducing its stimulatory effect on collagen transcription. The other acts on the binding of the adjacent factor, presumably by increasing its effectiveness in repressing the activity of the collagen promoter. The convergence of the TGF-β and TNF-α pathways on the same sequence of the α2(I) collagen promoter is yet another example of combinatorial gene regulation achieved through composite response elements."

We have isolated and characterized a bifunctional enzyme, designated E1, from K. pneumoniae, which first enolizes the diketone to the phosphoene-diol 6, then dephosphorylates this compound to the aci-reductone 7(1Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24785-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In K. pneumoniae this metabolite represents a branch point in the methionine salvage pathway, in that it can be converted to 8 and formate, or to CO, formate and methylthiopropionic acid(7Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21466-21469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The work described here was undertaken in order to characterize the enzyme(s) in K. pneumoniae involved in the metabolism of 7. For comparison the metabolism of 7 in rat liver was also investigated. The characterizations of the reaction(s) of the aci-reductone 7 requires substantial quantities of this compound. We have been unable to develop a viable chemical synthesis of 7 or the diketone 5, probably due to the presence of the methylthio substituent at C-4. This substituent predisposes the diketone to β-elimination and oxidation. Previously we have reported the synthesis of the desthio analogs of compounds 7 and 5 (compounds I and III), and shown them to be alternate substrates for the reactions undertaken by the bacterial enzymes of the methionine salvage pathway (1Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24785-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) These reactions are shown in Fig. S2. Enzyme activity, both E2 and E3, was identified by the disappearance of the substrate III as monitored by the decrease in its characteristic absorbance at 305 nm. III was generated in situ by the action of the enolase-phosphotase (E1) from K. pneumoniae on compound I. The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) included 1.5 mMI, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 5 μg of catalase, 5 μg of E1 (0.1 unit, 1 unit = 1 μmol of formate formed from I/min/mg protein), 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, at 25°C. The purification of E2 from K. pneumoniae is described elsewhere(7Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21466-21469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of the rat liver enzyme E3 is as follows. Frozen rat livers (40 g) (Pel-Freez), in 100 ml 0.5 mM MgSO4, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 M KPi, pH 7.5, were homogenized in a Waring blender 2 times for 30 s at 4°C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 20 min then at 22,000 × g for an additional 40 min. To the supernatant fluid (107 ml) was added dropwise with stirring 57 ml of acetone at −20°C over 15 min while maintaining the temperature between −7 and −10°C, by means of a dry ice glycerol bath. The suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 50 min in precooled tubes at −10°C. To the supernatant fluid (140 ml) 110 ml of acetone (−20°C) were added as described above. After centrifugation the precipitate was taken up in 0.5 mM MgSO4, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5 (buffer A), to a final volume of 30 ml and dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer A for 10 h. Any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. To the supernatant fluid (45 ml) was added ammonium sulfate (14.7 g) to 55% saturation. The suspension was stirred for 30 min at 4°C and then centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The precipitate was taken up in buffer A to a final volume of 10 ml and dialyzed twice against 1 liter of buffer A for 10 h. The protein solution (total final volume 18 ml) was applied in 6-ml batches onto a Bio-Gel P-60 column (100-200 mesh, 2.5 × 40 cm, Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated and eluted with buffer A. Fractions (5 ml) were collected. The active fractions, 16 and 17, were pooled and chromatographed on a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus. To 5 ml of protein solution 2.2 ml of a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate in buffer A were added, and the solution was applied onto a phenyl-Superose 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (buffer B). At a flow rate of 0.4 ml the column was eluted with 4 ml of buffer B, then 4 ml of 100 to 60% buffer B in a linear gradient, then 30 ml of 60 to 0% buffer B in a linear gradient. Fractions (0.8 ml) nos. 25 and 26 containing enzyme activity were combined. SDS-PAGE of E3 indicated a purity of >90%. Table 1 shows the results of a typical purification.Tabled 1 The synthesis of I from 2-oxopentanoic acid is described in Myers et al.(1Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24785-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction, in a total volume of 1 ml, contained 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.15 mM compound III, and enzyme to be assayed. The reaction proceeded for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by heating for 2 min in a boiling water bath and then cooled to 4°C. To the cooled solution were added 20 μl of NAD (50 mM) and 20 μl (34 units) of formate dehydrogenase (20 mg/ml in 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5). The reaction was monitored at 340 nm and was allowed to go to completion. Measurement was by means of an O2 electrode (Hansatech Instruments) at 30°C, in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction mixture contained 50 mM KPi pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.15 mM compound III, and enzyme to be assayed. The reaction (total volume 1.0 ml) contained 250-500-μl aliquots of the reaction mix to be assayed, 500-750 μl of 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, 10 liters of 10 μM NADH. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 units (10 μl) of bovine heart lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. The reaction was allowed to go to completion. Analysis was done by HPLC monitored by a refractive index detector. A Waters organic acid column (300 × 7.8 mm) was used and eluted with 5 mM H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. E1 and catalase in 1.0 ml of buffer, 50 mM KPi, 0.5 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5) were degassed for 15 min using a water aspirator at 4°C. The reaction vessel was then purged with argon and stirred for an additional 15 min under a stream of argon. The cycle of degassing and argon flushing was repeated. Compound I was then added to the reaction mix (final concentration 8 mM), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min to allow for the conversion of I to III. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme (E2 or E3) in degassed buffer, followed by the addition of 98.3%18O2 to a pressure of 1 atm. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min followed by quenching the reaction by the addition of 50 μl of 2 M HClO4 to precipitate the protein. The protein was removed by centrifugation in a bench top centrifuge, and the reaction mixture was brought to pH 9.0 by the addition of sodium hydroxide. The reaction mixture was then lyophilized and the salts removed by precipitation by the addition of ethanol. The organic acid products were derivatized and subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry. The following modification of the method of Hutchinson and Mabuini (8Hutchinson C.R. Mabuni C.T. J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 1977; 13: 571-574Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was employed. The sodium salt of the organic acid reaction products, formate, oxopentanoate, and butyrate, was reacted under an atmosphere of nitrogen, with a 2-fold excess of p-phenylphenacyl bromide and 1 eq of 18-crown-6 in 1:1 (v/v) dry acetonitrile:benzene at reflux for 24 h. The suspension was evaporated to dryness using a stream of nitrogen. The resulting residue was taken up in methylene chloride, applied onto a PrepSep™-Si normal phase silica extraction column (Fischer Scientific), and eluted with methylene chloride (2 ml) then diethyl ether (5 ml). The combined eluates were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was taken up in toluene (1 ml) for purification by HPLC. HPLC purification of the derivatized acids was done using a column (10 × 250 mm) of LiChrosphere Si-100 10-μm spherical normal phase silica gel (Merck) eluted with toluene at 1.0 ml/min. Peak detection, A285 nm, was accomplished using an Isco V4 absorbance detector. One-minute fractions were collected, and those containing pure p-phenylphenacyl-derivatized acids were pooled. The solvent was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Derivatized reaction products co-eluted with authentic p-phenylphenacylbutyrate, p-phenylphenacylformate, and p-phenylphenacyloxopentanoate. The purity of the derivatized reaction products was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR data (CdCl3), δ (ppm). For p-phenylphenacyl formate: 8.28 (s, 1H, -O2C H), 8.01 (td, 2H, aromatic), 7.73 (td, 2H, aromatic), 7.64 (td, td, 2H, aromatic), 7.50-7.40 (m, 3H, aromatic), and 5.48 (s, 2H, -COCH2O2CH). For p-phenylphenacyl butyrate: 8.05 (td, 2H, aromatic), 7.75 (td, 2H, aromatic), 7.68 (td, td, 2H, aromatic), 7.55-7.45 (m, 3H, aromatic), 5.38 (s, 2H, -COCH2OR), 2.52 (t, 2H, -COCH2R), 1.77 (m, 2H, COCH2CH2CH3), and 1.02 (t, 3H, COCH2CH2CH3). For p-phenylphenacyloxopentanoate: 7.80 (td, 2H, aromatic), 7.52 (td, 2H, aromatic), 7.45 (td, td, 2H, aromatic), 7.38-7.26 (m, 3H, aromatic), 5.31 (s, 2H, -COCH2OR), 2.70 (t, 2H, -COCOC H2R), 1.53 (m, 2H, COCOCH2C H2CH3), and 0.78 (t, 3H, COCOCH2CH2CH3). Mass spectrometry was performed using electron or chemical ionization with a Finnegan-Mat 90 spectrometer. The absence of a chromophoric cofactor of E2 led us to investigate the existence of a metal or dissociable cofactor by a variety of methods. Incubation of E2 with the iron-specific chelating agents α,α′-dipyridyl (10-3M), O-phenanthroline (10-4M), and 1,2-dihydroxy-benzene-3,5-disulfonate (10-2M) showed no more than 8% inhibition. Compounds such as ethylxanthate (10-5M), toluene-3,4-dithiol (10-5M), and diethyldithiocarbamate (10-5M) that are highly specific for copper were also ineffective as inhibitors(9Oka T. Simpson F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). E2 was concentrated to ~40 μM in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and submitted for electrospray mass spectrometry. Protein under native conditions 1:1 buffer, 0.2% acetic acid, gave a mass ion of 20,196 ± 10. Protein run under denaturing conditions, 1:1 buffer, 50% acetonitrile, 5% acetic acid, gave identical mass ion. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was performed to look for iron and zinc. Metal determinations were performed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy with a Perkin-Elmer model 4100 ZL instrument. Protein, prepared as describe for electrospray mass spectrometry, was diluted in 0.2% metal-free nitric acid (Baker). Aliquots (10 μl) of sample were loaded into pyroltically coated graphite tubes with an AS-70 automatic sampling device. The metal and zinc content is less than 0.01 g atom/mol of enzyme. In partially purified extracts of K. pneumoniaeIII is converted to formate and 2-ketopentanoic acid, with concomitant O2 uptake(1Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24785-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the oxidation of III can proceed non-enzymically and is inhibited by catalase(1Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24785-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21466-21469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation of III by crude bacterial extracts in the presence of catalase is not completely abolished. The oxidation of III must, therefore be partially enzymatic. We wanted to isolate and characterize the enzyme(s) responsible for the oxidation of III. In order to accomplish this we inhibited the non-enzymic oxidation of III in bacterial extracts with catalase and then searched for a protein fraction which can overcome this inhibition. We made the assumption that the enzymic oxidation of III is not inhibited by catalase. This strategy proved successful. We isolated, and purified to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-PAGE), an enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of III. This enzyme will be referred to as E2. The enzyme is monomeric and has a molecular weight of 20,000. No evidence for the presence of a cofactor was obtained. The stoichiometry of the reaction was examined. The reaction mixture contained 95 nmol of compound III, 5 μg of E2, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 0.5 ml (standard assay conditions). The reaction was allowed to proceed until O2 uptake ceased. At this point 90 nmol of O2 were consumed. A simultaneous formate assay (formate dehydrogenase) determined 73 nmol of formate. HPLC analysis (organic acid column) identified butyrate (92 nmol), and confirmed formate (84 nmol) as reaction products. To further identify the reaction products, a large scale enzymic reaction (5.0 mM compound III) was performed and the products generated were examined by 1H NMR. Analysis of the product mixture confirmed the enzymatic production of formate and butyrate. The 1H NMR spectrum of the enzymatic reaction products contained a singlet at δ = 8.47 ppm which was assigned to HCOO-K+ (compare standard HCOO-Na+ δ = 8.46 ppm). The spectrum also contained the following signals: 1) δ = 2.17 ppm (triplet); 2) δ = 1.56 ppm (multiplet); 3) δ = 0.90 ppm (triplet). These signals are in excellent agreement with authentic sodium butyrate. No evidence for the generation of any other compound was provided by 1H NMR. To further characterize the reaction, [C-1-3H]III (specific activity, 75,000 cpm/μmol) was prepared(7Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21466-21469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E2 was added to isotopic III under standard assay conditions. Examination of the reaction mixture by HPLC showed 50% of added radioactivity as formate, 40% in H2O, and 5% as an unidentified compound. Formate isolated by HPLC had a specific activity of 78,000 cpm/mol. ( 2[C-1-3H] III is enzymatically generated from [C1-3H] I (specific activity, 150,000 cpm/μmol). This generation is shown in Fig. R3. In the conversion of C-1-labeled I to III, 50% of the tritum originally in I should be found in solvent water, and the specific activity of [C-1-3H]III should be 75,000 cpm/μmol. insert graphic )No radioactivity was found in butyric acid. There results establishes that formate is formed primarily, possibly exclusively, from C-1 of III. The stoichiometry of the reaction requires formation of another “1-C” compound. It is likely that this compound is derived from C-2 of III. To identify this compound we synthesized [2-14C]III (specific activity, 30,000 cpm/μmol). Upon the action of enzyme on [2-14C]III no radioactivity was found in the quenched reaction mixture. We concluded that the compound derived from C-2 of III is a volatile, water insoluble compound. We have identified this molecule by its reaction with deoxyhemoglobin as carbon monoxide (7Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21466-21469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out under standard assay conditions in a gas-tight cuvette. Upon completion of the reaction deoxyhemoglobin was added with a syringe, and the mixture was scanned between 500-650 nm and 370-450 nm. The absorption maximum of deoxyhemoglobin at 555 nm disappeared, and new absorption maxima at 569 and 539 nm appeared. The Soret band shifted from 430 to 419 nm (Fig. 1, A and B). These data indicate the binding of carbon monoxide to deoxyhemoglobin(10Waterman M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum for carbomonoxyhemoglobin remains until the ratio of deoxyhemoglobin to compound III exceeds one, at which point the deoxyhemoglobin spectrum begins to emerge as dominant. Concentration of the reaction mixture, followed by gel filtration chromatography determined that the 14C-moiety is associated with hemoglobin. This result establishes C-2 of III as the source of CO, and that C-2 is not converted to any other reaction products. It is concluded that E2 catalyzes as shown in Fig. R1. insert graphic To identify the site of dioxygen attack in the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of III, the reaction was carried out in 18O2. The mass spectra of the derivatized reaction products show that one atom of 18O2 was incorporated into formate and butyrate (Table 2). A second 18O2 experiment was done and the infra red spectrum of carbomonoxyhemoglobin was determined. The spectrum was consistent with that of 16O2 carbomonoxyhemoglobin, i.e. no 18O incorporation into CO occurs(11Maxwell J.C. Caughey W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 The action of rat liver homogenates on [14C-2] compound I, Fig. S2(the preparation of which is described in (1Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24785-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (7Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21466-21469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was examined. To 150 nmol of 14C-2 compound I, 50 mM KPi, 0.5 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5, was added 0.5 mg of protein in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min and quenched with 2 M HClO4. The diketone was converted to α-ketopentanoic acid (28%), 65% remained as the unconverted diketone, 7% of the radioactivity was found as unidentified products. [14C]ketopentanoate and I were identified by HPLC chromatography using the organic acids column as described in the methods section. By analogy the natural substrate 5 (Fig. S1) would be converted to the α-keto acid precursor of methionine. This experiment established that the diketone 5 is a likely intermediate in the methionine salvage pathway in rat liver, and that 7 is an intermediate in the conversion of 5 to 8. We therefore investigated the metabolism of III in rat liver. As above, we fractionated rat liver homogenate in order to find a protein fraction which would catalyze the oxidation of III in the presence of catalase, which inhibits non-enzymic oxidation of III. Such a fraction was found and this activity was purified to near homogeneity, >90% as indicated by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein has a molecular mass of 29,000 daltons. No spectral evidence for the presence of a cofactor was obtained. The stoichiometry of this enzymatic reaction, however, was different than that of E2. E2 catalyzes the formation of CO, formate, and butyrate from I, whereas this enzyme (E3) catalyzes the formation of formate and oxopentanoic acid from I. The reaction mixture contained 100 nmol of compound III generated under standard assay conditions. The reaction was allowed to proceed until O2 uptake ceased. At this time, 93 nmol of O2 were consumed. A simultaneous formate assay determined 78 nmol of formate. HPLC analysis identified, 2-keto pentanoate (89 nmol), and confirmed formate (80 nmol) as reaction products. E3 catalyzes as shown in Fig. R2. insert graphic The action of E3 on compound III was examined using 18O2 as the oxygen source in order to determine the site of dioxygen attack. The data from the mass spectrometry of the derivatized reaction products show that a single 18O2 atom appears in formate and the carboxyl group of 2-oxopentanoate (Table 2). The studies described above were done with compound III, an analog of 1,2-dihydroxy-5-methylthiopentene anion (7, Fig. S1). We carried out experiments to determine whether the natural metabolite is a substrate for E2, and E3. Compound 7 (80 nmol) was enzymatically prepared as described previously (1Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24785-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was added to 40 μg of E2 in an oxygen electrode under our standard assay conditions. Total O2 consumption was 75 nmol; 68 nmol of methylthiopropionic acid and and 67 nmol of formate were produced. A parallel experiment examined the action of E3 on compound 7. O2 consumption was 73 nmol, 60 nmol of α-keto acid, and 68 nmol of formate were generated. These data sugest that the natural metabolite, 1,2-dihydroxy-5-methylthiopentene anion, is a substrate for both E2 and E3. In the methionine salvage pathway S-methylthioadenosine (MTA) is converted to methionine. We had previously reported that MTA is converted to 2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane 5 which, in turn, is converted to the aci-reductone 7 (Fig. S1). The final conversion of 7 to the α-keto acid precursor of methionine probably occurs non-enzymically in K. pneumoniae. We have also purified an enzyme from K. pneumoniae which converts 7 to CO, formate, and β-S-methylthiopropionic acid. All enzymes and intermediates of the methionine salvage pathway in K. pneumoniae have now been identified. In rat liver MTA is also converted to methionine, it has been established that 5 is a likely metabolite in the conversion of MTA to methionine(12Trackman P.C. Abeles R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have isolated and purified an enzyme from rat liver which converts 5 to the α-keto acid precursor of methionine. No corresponding enzyme is found in K. pneumoniae. The results reported here strongly suggest that the methionine salvage pathway in rat liver involves similar reactions as in K. pneumoniae. In the course of this work we have isolated two dioxygenases E2 and E3. Some information concerning their mechanism of action has been obtained. Carbon monoxide forming enzymes are rare. To date the only mammalian carbon monoxide-forming enzyme is heme oxygenase, which is operative in the pathway of heme degradation(13Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme acts on protohemin IX to form biliverdin and carbon monoxide. Three other carbon monoxide-forming enzymes have been identified in the fungus Aspergillus flavus and in the bacteria Pseudomonas putida and Arthrobacter sp. Ru61a. These enzymes are dioxygenases which are involved in heterocyclic ring cleavage reactions (14Westlake D.W.S. Talbot G. Blakley E.R. Simpson F.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1959; 5: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15De Beyer A. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Bott G. Schmidt M. Rommel T.O. Lingens F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Quercertinase from A. flavus is a copper-containing dioxygenase which oxidatively cleaves the ring of quercertin to yield carbon monoxide and depside (2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinolcarboxylic acid). When 18O2 is used as the dioxygen source, the enzyme incorporates one 18O molecule into the 2 and 4 positions of the depside, but not into carbon monoxide. When [3-14C]quercertin was used as a substrate, all of the radioactivity was present in the carbon of carbon monoxide(17Simpson F.J. Talbot G. Westlake D.W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1960; 2: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The product distribution of the carbon monoxide-forming enzyme from K. pneumoniae (E2) is analogous to that of quecertinase. Recently studies of the CO-forming dioxygenase from the bacterium Arthrobacter sp. Ru61a have indicated an analogous reaction to that of E2, in which no metal or chromophoric cofactor has been identified(18Bauer I. De Beyer A. Tshisuaka B. Fetzner S. Lingens F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 299-304Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reaction of E2 represents a 1,3-oxygenolytic attack which results in the oxidative cleavage of two carbon-carbon bonds. A proposed mechanism for the formation of carbon monoxide from compound III is described in Fig. 2. This mechanism necessitates the formation of a five membered cyclic peroxide intermediate, which then decomposes to form products. Fig. 2 represents the addition of oxygen to the carbanion tautomer of the aci-reductone to form the hydroperoxide anion which then attacks the C-3 carbonyl. The reactions of carbanions with molecular oxygen have been well studied(19Barton Jones J. Chem. Soc. Pt. III. 1965; : 3563-3570Crossref Google Scholar). An investigation of the autoxidation of ketone and ester anions by Gersmann and Bickel (20Gersmann H.R. Bickel A.F. J. Chem. Soc. 1971; 12c: 2230-2237Google Scholar) have shown that the primary products of these reactions are α-hydroperoxides, which can be isolated in high yields. The formation of the peroxide intermediate has also been proposed by Abell and Schloss (21Abell L.M. Schloss J.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7883-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as an intermediate in oxygenase side reactions of carbanion forming enzymes. They determined that the expression of oxygenase activity was dependent on the accessibility of the carbanionic intermediate to molecular oxygen and on the ability of the enzyme to stabilize the initially formed peroxide anion through protonation with an enzymic group or through metal coordination. There is some reluctance, however, to accept the simple one-step mechanism for the formation of the hydroperoxy anion from the reaction of a carbanion with molecular oxygen, as it involves a violation of the spin conservation rule(22Russel G.A. Adv. Chem. Sci. 1968; 75: 174-180Crossref Google Scholar). Instead, a stepwise single electron transfer from the carbanion to molecular oxygen could be proposed for the formation of the hydroperoxy anion intermediate. Carbon monoxide is a readily extruded functional group in many reactions and its extrusion from the cyclic peroxide intermediate may proceed by a radical, or a concerted mechanism(23Tsuji Ohno Synthesis. 1969; : 157-169Google Scholar, 24Stark B.P. Duke A.J. Extrusion Reactions. Pergamon, Oxford1967: 16-46Crossref Google Scholar). E3 is a dioxygenase which also utilizes the aci-reductone as a substrate. E3, however, directs a 1,2-oxygenolytic attack on the substrate. A speculative reaction mechanism is depicted in Fig. 3. This mechanism suggests the formation of a dioxetane as an intermediate which subsequently decomposes to form products. The reaction to form the alkyperoxide intermediate from the attack of the carbanion on O2 is the same as that described for E2. The reaction differs from that of E2 in that the alkyperoxide anion intermediate adds to C-2 to form the dioxetane, rather than C-3 to form the five-membered cyclic peroxide. The fact that this enzyme, as well as E2, is not inhibited by catalase suggests that an alkylperoxide intermediate is not released into solution. The metabolism of the aci-reductone 7 has been investigated in both the K. pneumoniae and rat liver. This compound is metabolized enzymatically in rat liver by a dioxygenase to the α-keto acid precursor of methionine. This enzyme represents the final enzymatic transformation of the methionine salvage pathway which needed to be identified. In K. pneumoniae this metabolite represents a branch point in the pathway, whose metabolism can follow two possible routes. This molecule can either undergo a non-enzymatic oxidation to the α-keto acid precursor of methionine, or can be acted upon by the CO-forming enzyme to yield CO, formate, and methylthiopropionic acid. Recent experiments in mammals, which establish CO as a neurotransmitter(25Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H.

To evaluate the regulatory influence of different homo- and heterodimers, NF-κB subunits were analyzed for transcriptional activity in vitro using test templates containing two types of NF-κB recognition elements (the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer and the IFN-β-positive regulatory domain II (PRDII)) as well as IFN-β PRDIII-PRDI-PRDII linked to the −56 minimal promoter of rabbit β-globin. Recombinant NF-κB subunits (p50, p65, c-Rel, p52, and IκBα) and interferon regulatory factor 1 were produced from either Escherichia coli or baculovirus expression systems. Transcriptional analysis in vitro demonstrated that 1) various dimeric complexes of NF-κB differentially stimulated transcription through the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer or PRDII up to 20-fold; 2) recombinant IκBα specifically inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription in vitro; and 3) different NF-κB complexes and interferon regulatory factor 1 cooperated to stimulate transcription in vitro through the PRDIII-PRDI-PRDII virus-inducible regulatory domains of the IFN-β promoter. These results demonstrate the role of NF-κB protein dimerization in differential transcriptional activation in vitro and emphasize the role of cooperativity between transcription factor families as an additional regulatory level to maintain transcriptional specificity.

Transcriptional activation of eukaryotic gene expression in response to developmental or environmental signals requires the assembly of multiple DNA-binding proteins with specific DNA regulatory domains in a stereospecific nucleoprotein complex (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). Changes in the specific combination of transcription factors associated with a particular gene by modification, de novo synthesis, or protein-protein interaction may account for developmental or temporal regulation of transcription. Protein-protein interactions between transcription factors also confer a level of transcriptional specificity that would not be achieved by individual proteins(1Buratowski S.

Two broad groups of transcription factors, general transcription factors and upstream activators, are involved in the accurate transcription of mRNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase II.

Mutations in basic residues of TFIIB that crucially affect the interaction with acidic activators fail to bind activator proteins such as VP16 and do not respond to activation, but still function in basal transcription. These observations suggest that interaction between an acidic activator and TFIIB is required for transcriptional activation (6Roberts S.G.E. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R.

In this study, recombinant NF-κB subunits and IRF-1 proteins were produced from either Escherichia coli or baculovirus expression systems and were used to examine NF-κB-dependent and IFN-β promoter-mediated transcription in vitro. These experiments demonstrated that 1) various dimeric complexes of NF-κB differentially stimulated transcription through two distinct NF-κB elements; 2) recombinant IκBα specifically inhibited NF-κB-dependent activation; and 3) different NF-κB heterodimers and IRF-1 cooperated to activate transcription in vitro through the PRDIII-PRDI-PRDII virus-inducible regulatory domains of interferon-β.

In vitro transcription templates HS-RβG, PRDII × 2, and PRDI × 2 were a kind gift from N. MacDonald and C. Weissmann and were described previously(8MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Naf D. Gallant P.

Skup D. Hiscott J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 323-333PubMed Google Scholar) and (23Cohen L. Hiscott J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); refer also to Fig. 3). Test transcription templates containing the insert sequences of the HIV-1 enhancer, the HIV-1 enhancer mutant, and the PRDIII-PRDI-PRDII elements (P512) (see Fig. 3) were synthesized chemically and flanked by a 5′-ClaI-compatible overhang (CG) on the top strand and a 5′-HindIII-compatible overhang (TCGA) on the bottom strand. These sequences were inserted into the ClaI-HindIII fragment at position −56 of PRDII-RβG to replace the PRDII sequence. For construction of the reference template ΔRβG, HS-RβG was digested with SalI, filled in with Klenow enzyme, and self-ligated to block one of two AccI sites. The resulting plasmid was digested with AccI, treated with exonuclease III, and ligated, yielding an internal reference plasmid with a 22-bp deletion (residues 704-725). An upstream SV40 enhancer sequence was removed by digestion with HindIII and EcoRI, fill in with Klenow enzyme, and self-ligated. All constructions were verified by sequencing. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were isolated from E. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) following 3 h of induction with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 37°C. Bacterial extracts in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fusion proteins were enzymatically cleaved by thrombin (Sigma) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl2, and 2.5 mM CaCl2 for 2-4 h at room temperature. The final cleaved protein products were eluted from the beads in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl2 and stored with the addition of 1 mM dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Recombinant p52 protein was eluted with 15 mM glutathione as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein without cleavage. For the production of polyhistidine-tagged protein, recombinant baculoviruses were prepared by using a BaculoGold™ transfection kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmingen). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses and cultured for 4 days at 28°C. Infected cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). Recombinant proteins were purified by using rapid affinity purification with His-Bind metal chelation resin under nondenaturing conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen, pET system manual) (76). HIV oligonucleotide (5′-AGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCC-3′), the PRDII (P2) probe (5′-GGGAAATTCCGGGAAATTCC-3′), and the PRDI (P1) probe (5′-GGGAGAAGTGAAAGTG-3′) were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ γ-32P]ATP. The binding mixture (20 μl) contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 62.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). After 20 min of incubation with labeled probe at room temperature, the mixture was loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel prepared in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA and electrophoresed at 200 V for 2-3 h. The in vitro transcription reactions were carried out with nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (HeLaScribe, Promega) essentially as described previously (11Cohen L. Hiscott J. Virology. 1992; 191: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Cohen L. Lacoste J. Parniak M. Daigneault L. Skup D. Hiscott J.

Transcription reactions (25 μl) contain 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 8.5% glycerol, 10 units of RNasin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 4 units of HeLa nuclear extract, the indicated amount of purified recombinant proteins, 250 ng of each test and reference template, 8 mM MgCl2, and 0.4 mM NTP. To generate NF-κB heterodimers for the in vitro transcription assays, an equal molar ratio of individual NF-κB subunits was mixed in renaturation buffer, and heterodimers were allowed to form for 1 h at 37°C. RNA from the transcription reaction was harvested after 1 h of incubation at 30°C by a small-scale guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure(62Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). The test RβG transcripts and the reference transcripts from ΔRβG and p901 were quantitated by S1 nuclease mapping as described previously ((12Cohen L. Lacoste J. Parniak M. Daigneault L. Skup D. Hiscott J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 323-333PubMed Google Scholar); refer to Fig. 3). To obtain relatively large amounts of protein for in vitro studies, the E. coli glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system and baculovirus expression system were used to express NF-κB and IRF proteins. The cDNAs encoding the NF-κB subunits p50, p52, and IκBα were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (Fig. 1A) and purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the purity was estimated from Coomassie-stained gels at 60, 80, and 60% for p50, p52, and IκBα, respectively (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-3). The p65, c-Rel, p50/p65 fusion, IRF-1, and IRF-2 proteins were expressed in baculovirus as polyhistidine-tagged proteins (Fig. 1B). These polyhistidine-containing recombinant proteins were isolated from insect cell lysates under native elution conditions by a rapid affinity purification using His-Bind metal chelation resin. The purified recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their apparent molecular masses were slightly higher than predicted: 85, 85, 75, 50, and 48 kDa for p50/p65, c-Rel, p65, IRF-1, and IRF-2, respectively. The purity was estimated at >80% for p50/p65, p65, and IRF-1; 60% for IRF-2; and only 10% for c-Rel (Fig. 1C, lanes 4-8). The DNA binding activity of the recombinant NF-κB proteins was assessed in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the HIV-1 enhancer and P2 probes.

First, we examined the role of the two pathways of insulin signaling, Ras-dependent and wortmannin/LY294002-sensitive, in glycogen synthase activation. Although negative dominant Ras (Ras17N) induction in PC12 cells markedly decreased activities of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) and pp90 S6 kinase in response to insulin or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), activation of glycogen synthase by these agents was unaffected by negative dominant Ras induction. In contrast, wortmannin and 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, antagonized glycogen synthase activation in response to insulin or IGF-I. Next, we examined the contribution of pp70 S6 kinase, one of the wortmannin/LY294002-sensitive signaling molecules on glycogen synthase activation. Immunosuppressant rapamycin completely blocked activation of pp70 S6 kinase by insulin or IGF-I, but rapamycin alone or in combination with induction of negative dominant Ras failed to antagonize glycogen synthase activation by these hormones. These data suggest that 1) activation of Ras-MAP kinase is not necessary for stimulation of glycogen synthase and 2) activation of wortmannin/LY294002sensitive pathway, independent of pp70 S6 kinase, plays a key role in glycogen synthase regulation in PC12 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1972310895,"We describe a novel method for the enzymatic synthesis of neoglycoproteins. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Arthrobacter protophormiae (Endo-A) had high levels of transglycosylation activity. The enzyme activity of Endo-A was markedly increased by adding 4-L-aspartylglycosylamine (GlcNAc-Asn) to the reaction mixture. Digesting (Man)6(GlcNAc)2 with the enzyme in the presence of GlcNAc-Asn gave a mixture of hydrolytic ((Man)6GlcNAc) and transglycosylic ((Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn) products. By means of transglycosylation, (Man)6GlcNAc was transferred en bloc to the partially deglycosylated ovalbumin glycopeptide (EEKYN(GlcNAc) LTSVL) concomitant with the hydrolysis of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn. The structure of the transglycosylation product was designated as (Man)6(GlcNAc)2-peptide by amino acid composition and sequence analysis as well as ion mass spectrometry. The enzyme also transferred oligosaccharide to partially deglycosylated ribonuclease B (GlcNAc-protein) during the hydrolysis of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn. Native ribonuclease B had (Man)5-9 (GlcNAc)2 as its heterogeneous N-linked sugar chains. High performance liquid chromatography showed that all of the N-linked sugar chains of the synthetic neoribonuclease of the pyridylamino derivatives were modified to (Man)6(GlcNAc)2.

High performance liquid chromatography showed that all of the N-linked sugar chains of the synthetic neoribonuclease of the pyridylamino derivatives were modified to (Man)6(GlcNAc)2. Asparagine-linked glycosylation begins with the transfer of the precursor oligosaccharide (Glc)3(Man)9(GlcNAc)2 to a nascent polypeptide, and the precursor oligosaccharide is modified by Golgi enzymes, which generate a heterogeneous assortment of oligosaccharide structures(1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). Therefore, naturally occurring glycoproteins have a high degree of heterogeneity in their oligosaccharide moiety. For example, human serum immunoglobulin G contains over 30 varieties of biantennary N-linked sugar chains(2Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Sutton B.J. Fernandes D.L. Leung A. Stanworth D. Rademacher T.W. Mizuochi T. Taniguchi T. Matsuta K. Takeuchi F. Nagano Y. Miyamoto T. Kobata A. Nature. 1985; 316: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). It is difficult to study the biological roles of individual oligosaccharides because they are highly heterogeneous in glycoproteins. There are several approaches to the analysis of the functions of the individual sugar chains in glycoproteins. Besides conventional analysis with specific glycosidases(3Kobata A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis can now identify the role of individual sugar chains in glycoproteins(4Matzuk M.M. Biome I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 5Matzuk M.M. Keene J.F. Biome I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2409-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The properties of naturally occurring and recombinant glycoproteins produced in different heterologous cells can also be prepared(6Hsieh P. Rosner M.R. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2548-2554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shares B.T. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5646-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, these DNA-mediated studies call for the isolation and preparation of the genes that code for glycoproteins, and the structures of the sugar chains vary according to the host cell. Therefore, a method for remodeling oligosaccharides that are heterogeneous in terms of size and branching into homogeneous sugar chains would be useful. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.96) releases N-linked oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins by cleaving the di-N-acetylchitobiose unit. This enzyme is important in glycoprotein research, because it can be used to recover both the N-linked oligosaccharides and partially deglycosylated proteins without damaging them. Arthrobacter protophormiae produces endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (called Endo-A) ( 1The abbreviations used are: Endo-Aendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Arthrobacter protophormiaeHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPApyridylaminoConAconcanavalin Adansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. )when cultured in medium containing ovalbumin; the purification and properties of the enzyme have been reported(10Takegawa K. Nakoshi M. Iwahara S. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that Endo-A has strong transglycosylation activity and that GlcNAc is transferred to the reducing end of (Man)6GlcNAc during chitobiose cleavage by this enzyme(11Takegawa K. Yamaguchi S. Kondo A. Iwamoto H. Nakoshi M. Kato I. Iwahara S. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 849-855PubMed Google Scholar). Endo-A can transfer (Man)6GlcNAc to various acceptors, such as glucose, mannose, and gentiobiose(12Takegawa K. Yamaguchi S. Kondo A. Kato I. Iwahara S. Biochem. Int. 1991; 25: 829-835PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that Endo-A can transfer (Man)6GlcNAc to 4-L-aspartylglycosylamine (GlcNAc-Asn). Therefore, we predicted that Endo-A would be useful for synthesizing not only novel oligosaccharides but also neoglycopeptides or neoglycoproteins. Transglycosylation is a type of hydrolysis in which the glycosyl moiety of the substrate, instead of water, is transferred to other hydroxy compounds. In addition, many exoglycosidases and endoglycosidases have transglycosylation or transfer reaction activities that have been used in the synthesis of various glycosides (reviewed in (13Nilsson K.G.I. Trends Biotechnol. 1988; 6: 256-264Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and (14Cote G.L. Tao B.Y. Glycoconjugate J. 1990; 7: 145-162Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, there is little information available on the enzymatic synthesis of neoglycoproteins by endoglycosidases. Here we examined the transglycosylation activity catalyzed by Endo-A toward GlcNAc-peptide derived from ovalbumin. We also describe the synthesis of neoglycoprotein by Endo-A. endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Arthrobacter protophormiae high performance liquid chromatography pyridylamino concanavalin A 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. Endo-A was obtained from culture fluid of A. protophormiae as described(10Takegawa K. Nakoshi M. Iwahara S. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn was prepared from ovalbumin by the procedure of Huang et al.(15Huang C.-C. Mayer Jr., H.E. Montgomery R. Carbohydr. Res. 1970; 13: 127-137Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) using Dowex 50W-X2 column chromatography. Dansyl derivatives of asparaginyl glycopeptides were prepared by the method of Gray(16Gray W.R.

Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B (RNase B) was purchased from Sigma (Type III-B) and further purified by ConA-Sepharose 4B column chromatography.

Pepsin was purchased from Sigma. The standard oligosaccharides (Man)5-9GlcNAc were prepared from ovalbumin or porcine thyroglobulin by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase digestion. The oligosaccharide (Man)5(GlcNAc)2 was prepared from (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn by hydrazinolysis according to Hase et al.(20Hase S. Koyama H. Daiyasu H. Takemoto H. Hara S. Kobayashi Y. Kyougoku Y. Ikeda T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and GlcNAc-Asn was prepared from (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase digestion. Partially deglycosylated glycopeptide was isolated from ovalbumin by means of pepsin digestion according to Ishihara et al.(21Ishihara H. Takahashi N. Ito J. Takeuchi E. Tejima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 669: 261Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Crystalline ovalbumin (2 g) was heat-denatured and digested with 20 mg of pepsin in 40 ml of 0.15 M HCl-citrate buffer (pH 1.4) in the presence of toluene to avoid bacterial contamination. The reaction mixture was lyophilized and dissolved in 20 mM NH4HCO3. The clear supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (1.0 × 111 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM NH4HCO3. Fractions containing the carbohydrates were pooled, dried, and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (1.0 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM NH4HCO3. Peptic glycopeptides obtained by these procedures were further separated by means of HPLC with a Wakosil 5C-18 column (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The carbohydrate peak was collected and partially deglycosylated by the Flavobacterium endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The reaction mixture was applied once more to HPLC, and a peak of a single peptide containing a GlcNAc residue was collected. Analyses of the amino acid composition, molecular weight, and amino acid sequence revealed that the structure of the GlcNAc-containing peptide was Glu-Glu-Lys-Tyr-Asn(GlcNAc)-Leu-Thr-Ser-Val. The amino acid sequence of the GlcNAc-peptide was in agreement with the data from the mRNA sequence of ovalbumin reported by McReynolds et al.(22McReynolds L. O'Malley B.W. Nisbet A.D. Fothergill J.E. Givol D. Fields S. Robertson M. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1978; 273: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Pyridylamination of oligosaccharides and HPLC analysis of pyridylamino (PA) oligosaccharides proceeded as described(23Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Standard PA oligosaccharides were obtained from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. The molecular weight of oligosaccharides or glycopeptides was estimated by ion spray mass spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer API-III) according to Bruins et al.(24Bruins A.P. Covey T.R. Henion J.D. Anal. Chem. 1987; 59: 2642-2646Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Amino acids were hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl for 24 h at 100°C in evacuated, sealed glass tubes and then evaluated using an amino acid analyzer (Hitachi L8500). The amino acid sequence of the GlcNAc-peptide from ovalbumin was determined using a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 477A). Phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives were separated and identified with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (model 120A). The elution position of GlcNAc-Asn was directly identified by means of conventional sequencing as described(25Takegawa K. Yoshikawa M. Mishima T. Nakoshi M. Iwahara S. Biochem. Int. 1991; 25: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar). Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was assayed using (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn-dansyl as the substrate(10Takegawa K. Nakoshi M. Iwahara S. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit was defined as the amount yielding 1 μmol of GlcNAc-Asn-dansyl/min at 37°C under our assay conditions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in a 17% acrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS by the method of Laemmli(26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. We found that exposing Endo-A to a mixture of monosaccharides or oligosaccharides increased the apparent enzyme activity(11Takegawa K. Yamaguchi S. Kondo A. Iwamoto H. Nakoshi M. Kato I. Iwahara S. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 849-855PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takegawa K. Nakoshi M. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Iwahara S. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1991; 71: 278-288Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We determined that Endo-A has powerful transglycosylation activity and that it transfers GlcNAc to the reducing end of (Man)6GlcNAc during chitobiose cleavage. We initially investigated the effects of GlcNAc-Asn upon Endo-A activity. About 50 μmol of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn-dansyl was incubated at 37°C with 0.005 unit of Endo-A in 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 6.0. The enzyme activity was measured after an incubation with various concentrations of GlcNAc or GlcNAc-Asn for 10 min. The enzyme activity increased with increasing amounts of GlcNAc or GlcNAc-Asn. GlcNAc-Asn enhanced activity more than GlcNAc, and the relative activity with 80 mM GlcNAc-Asn to that without GlcNAc-Asn was about 1300% (Fig. 1A). These results suggested that (Man)6GlcNAc was transferred to GlcNAc-Asn and that the transglycosylation caused an increase in GlcNAc-Asn-dansyl liberation. To confirm the transglycosylation products, 30 μg of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2 (21 nmol) prepared from (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn by hydrazinolysis was incubated with 0.004 unit of Endo-A in 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) in the presence of various concentrations of GlcNAc-Asn for 10 min at 37°C (total volume, 20 μl). After the incubation was stopped by boiling for 3 min, the reaction mixtures were applied to Sephadex G-15 to remove any remaining GlcNAc-Asn and then lyophilized prior to amino acid analysis. Peaks containing neutral sugars were collected and hydrolyzed with 6 M HCl for 12 h, and then the incorporation of the asparagine residues into oligosaccharides was measured using an amino acid analyzer. The asparagine incorporation increased with increasing concentrations of GlcNAc-Asn (Fig. 1B). This result showed that GlcNAc-Asn was attached to (Man)6GlcNAc during cleavage of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2. The attachment of GlcNAc-Asn to (Man)6GlcNAc was also confirmed as an increase in the molecular weight by means of ion mass spectrometry (data not shown). Reaction mixtures containing 0.004 unit of Endo-A, 100 nmol of GlcNAc-peptide prepared from ovalbumin as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) in a total volume of 20 μl were incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was started by adding 50 μg (33 nmol) of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn and stopped by boiling for 3 min at 100°C. The reaction mixture was then directly analyzed by HPLC. Only one major peak (P-1) was obtained without (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn in the reaction mixture (Fig. 2A-I). However, another peptide peak (P-2) was generated in the presence of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn (Fig. 2A, II). This peak was collected and hydrolyzed with 6 M HCl or 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, and the amino acid or amino sugar contents were investigated using an amino acid analyzer. The amino acid composition of P-2 was identical to that of P-1, except that the GlcNAc content was doubled. This result suggested that the transfer of (Man)6GlcNAc to the GlcNAc-peptide occurred through the transglycosylation of Endo-A. To further confirm the structure of P-2, we analyzed P-1 and P-2 by means of ion mass spectrometry, and they yielded molecular ion peaks of 1398 and 2573, respectively (data not shown). These results indicated that a neoglycopeptide had been synthesized by the transglycosylation of Endo-A and that the product (Man)6(GlcNAc)2-peptide was easily separated from GlcNAc-peptide and detected by HPLC. We determined the optimal conditions for neoglycopeptide formation by Endo-A as follows. Changes during the transfer of the GlcNAc-peptide to the oligosaccharide by Endo-A are shown in Fig. 2B. In the initial stage of the reaction, much (Man)6(GlcNAc)2-peptide was synthesized by the transglycosylation activity of the enzyme. However, as the reaction proceeded, the transglycosylation product (Man)6(GlcNAc)2-peptide was gradually hydrolyzed by the enzyme once again. To investigate the effect of pH on the yield of the neoglycopeptide, the reaction was performed at various pH values, and the amounts of the enzyme products were measured after 10 min at 37°C. The enzyme was active and stable above pH 4.0. Transglycosylation did not occur at pH 3.0, and the optimum pH level for neoglycopeptide synthesis was 6.0 in ammonium acetate buffer (data not shown). The effect of the GlcNAc-peptide concentrations on the production of the neoglycopeptide was investigated by performing the reaction with various concentrations of GlcNAc-peptide for 10 min at pH 6.0. Increasing GlcNAc-peptide concentrations increased the production of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2-peptide (Fig. 3A). Because of the solubility, however, we could not add or test higher concentrations of GlcNAc-peptide. The effect of the substrate concentration on the production of the neoglycopeptide was investigated in the presence of various concentrations of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn at pH 6.0. The level of neoglycopeptide increased with increasing amounts of the substrate up to 80 nmol (final concentration of 4 mM), and concentrations above 4 mM were not as effective (Fig. 3B). The production of neoglycopeptide in the presence of various concentrations of Endo-A was investigated. The amount of neoglycopeptide increased with the enzyme concentration, of which around 8 milliunits (0.4 unit/ml) was optimal (Fig. 3C). The results described above show that Endo-A can synthesize a neoglycopeptide. To test whether a neoglycoprotein could be made, we synthesized neoribonuclease by means of the transglycosylation activity of Endo-A under the optimal reaction conditions described above. To raise the efficiency of the transglycosylation activity of Endo-A, RNase B, which was partially deglycosylated by Flavobacterium endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase to give GlcNAc-protein, was denatured with 6 M guanidine HCl. After dialysis with distilled water for 2 days, denatured GlcNAc-RNase was lyophilized and used in this experiment. The reaction conditions for transglycosylation by Endo-A were as follows. 1 mg of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn was incubated with 0.01 unit of Endo-A in 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) in the presence of lyophilized GlcNAc-RNase (3.0 mg) (total volume, 50 μl). After incubation for 10 min at 37°C, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and placed on a column (1.5 × 6 cm) containing ConA-Sepharose 4B at 4°C. Most of the GlcNAc-RNase passed through the ConA column. However, some bound to the column, but it was eluted with buffer containing 1 M α-D-methyl mannoside (Fig. 4). To characterize the ConA-bound RNase further, both forms were pooled and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNase that did not bind to the ConA column had the same molecular weight as GlcNAc-RNase (Fig. 5D). The molecular weight of the bound RNase was increased by about 2,000, and it migrated to the position of native RNase B (Fig. 5E). When bound RNase was incubated with 0.01 unit of the Flavobacterium endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, it was deglycosylated again and migrated to the position of GlcNAc-RNase (Fig. 5F). These results showed that Endo-A transferred the oligosaccharide (Man)6GlcNAc from (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn to GlcNAc-RNase. Therefore, we called the bound RNase “neo-RNase,” and set out to find whether (Man)6GlcNAc was actually linked to it.Figure 5:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of neo-RNase.

One of the two forms of RNase (500 μg) was incubated with 0.1 unit of the Flavobacterium endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase at 37°C for 12 h. After the N-linked sugar chains were partially released from the protein moiety, the reaction mixtures were pyridylaminated and analyzed by HPLC. PA oligosaccharides from the native RNase B separated into five peaks (peaks (Man)5GlcNAc-PA to (Man)9GlcNAc-PA) (Fig. 6A). Liang et al.(28Liang C.-J. Yamashita K. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the N-linked sugar chains of RNase B are (Man)5-8(GlcNAc)2. However, we found a small amount of (Man)9(GlcNAc)2. The N-linked sugar chain of neo-RNase consisted entirely of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2 (Fig. 6B). These results showed that the heterogeneous N-linked sugar chains (Man)5-9(GlcNAc)2 of the RNase B were converted into homogeneous (Man)6(GlcNAc)2 by the oligosaccharide-transferring mechanism of Endo-A. Some reports have described the attachment of naturally occurring N-linked sugar chains to proteins. Mencke and Wold (29Mencke A.J. Wold F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14799-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the glycosyl-asparagine derivatives obtained by Pronase digestion of ovalbumin are coupled to bovine serum albumin by reductive amination with NaCNBH3. Yan (30Yan S.-C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) has reported that glycosyl-Asn derivatives can be coupled to bovine β-casein and bovine pancreatic RNase A by a transglutaminase. These methods are useful for attaching oligosaccharides to proteins, but there are several problems. It is often difficult to prepare glycosyl-asparagine derivatives by Pronase digestion, because many glycopeptides are resistant to proteases. This procedure also yields unexpected changes in the protein structure and activity. Most importantly these methods cannot be used to attach the oligosaccharides to all of the original glycosylation sites of the native glycoprotein molecules. Therefore, these strategies may change the conformation of the protein moiety. Endo-A has powerful transglycosylation activity, and, during chitobiose cleavage of (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, (Man)6GlcNAc is transferred to the C-4 hydroxy group through a β-linkage of GlcNAc(11Takegawa K. Yamaguchi S. Kondo A. Iwamoto H. Nakoshi M. Kato I. Iwahara S. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 849-855PubMed Google Scholar). Trimble et al.(31Trimble R.B. Atkinson P.H. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H.

Alexander S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4540-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) (Endo-F), have glycerol attached to their reducing ends. We examined the oligosaccharide-transferring activity of commercial preparations of Endo-F and Endo-H (endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Streptomyces plicatus)(33Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes did not transfer oligosaccharides to GlcNAc-peptides or GlcNAc-proteins (data not shown). Bardales and Bhavanadan (34Bardales R.M. Bhavanadan V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that endo-α-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Diplococcus pneumoniae has not only transglycosylation activity but also transfer activity (reversed hydrolysis). When Galβ1 →3GalNAc was incubated with D. pneumoniae endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in the presence of glycerol, the trisaccharide Gal-GalNAc-glycerol was synthesized by the transfer activity of the enzyme. To examine the reverse hydrolysis activity of Endo-A, (Man)6GlcNAc and GlcNAc-peptide from ovalbumin were mixed and incubated with Endo-A under various conditions. However, we could not detect any reverse hydrolysis product (data not shown). The substrate specificity of the Endo-A is very similar to that of Endo-CII from Clostridium perfringens(35Ito S. Muramatsu T. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 171: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 36Tai T. Yamashita K. Ito S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6687-6694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it hydrolyzes primarily high mannose type oligosaccharides(10Takegawa K. Nakoshi M. Iwahara S. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular weight of Endo-A (approximately 80,000) is quite different from other endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, such as Endo-H (37Robbins P.W. Trimble R.B. Wirth D.F. Hering C. Maley F.

Morita Y. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (267 amino acids), and Endo-F1(38Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Schrader W.P. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3868-3872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (289 amino acids), all of which show similar substrate specificity. There are several amino acid residues that are well conserved in all endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases(17Takegawa K. Mikami B. Iwahara S. Morita Y. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We cloned and sequenced the Endo-A gene and found that the N-terminal half of the amino acid sequence of the enzyme had low identity with other endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases (36Tai T. Yamashita K.

Iwahara, manuscript in preparation. )Studies are in progress to determine which amino acid residues or domains of Endo-A protein contribute to the high transglycosylation activity. Here we reported a new method for the conversion of N-linked sugar chains that uses the transglycosylation activity of Endo-A (Fig. S1). This method is useful for attaching the same N-linked sugar chains to all the original glycosylation sites of glycoprotein molecules. No effective method is currently available for the conversion of heterogeneous N-linked sugar chains to homogeneous N-linked sugar chains in glycoproteins. We described for the first time a one-step procedure for the preparation of neoglycoproteins using the transglycosylation activity of endoglycosidase A. The use of glycosyltransferases in the synthesis of neoglycoproteins has not been extensively investigated. In general, glycosyltransferases are present at low concentrations and are bound to intracellular membranes. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of the enzymes is very limited. Therefore, these transferases are not stable, are difficult to purify, and require nucleotide sugars as donors. On the other hand, Endo-A can transfer the oligosaccharides en bloc, has broad pH stability(10Takegawa K. Nakoshi M. Iwahara S. Yamamoto K. Tochikura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and does not require nucleotide sugars for the reaction. Because of the substrate specificity of the enzyme, however, the conversion of the N-linked oligosaccharides by Endo-A is limited. Endo-A specifically acts upon high mannose type oligosaccharides, and it did not have transglycosylation activities toward complex oligosaccharides (data not shown). Our data showed that the GlcNAc-peptide (10 amino acids) derived from ovalbumin is a better acceptor than bovine RNase B (GlcNAc-protein) for the transglycosylation reaction of Endo-A. Endo-A can readily deglycosylate native bovine RNase B but shows very little oligosaccharide-transferring activity toward the native form of partially deglycosylated RNase (data not shown). Considering the steric effects of the protein moiety on the accessibility of glycosylation sites to Endo-A, it seems that steric factors have a more direct influence upon the transglycosylation rather than upon hydrolytic activity. Therefore, the reaction conditions should be further examined to obtain the optimal transglycosylation activity of Endo-A. Fan and Lee ( 3J.-Q. Fan and Y. C. Lee, personal communication. )have found that Endo-A has high transglycosylation activity in the presence of organic solvents, such as acetone, Me2SO, and N,N,dimethylformamide. Moreover, Endo-A exerted exclusive transglycosylation activity in a reaction mixture containing acetone, and a hydrolysis product was undetectable under these conditions. These organic solvents may increase the yield of neoglycoproteins by Endo-A. The method presented here is suitable and practical for the improved synthesis of neoglycoproteins.

Here, we have further analyzed the association of one such chaperone, calnexin, with human major histocompatibility complex class II α and β subunits and the invariant chain. Calnexin associates with transport-competent invariant chain trimers (p33 or p41), as well as ER-retained trimers (p35/33 or p43/41), suggesting that ER retention of the latter is not because of calnexin association. Neither the replacement of the transmembrane segment of the DRβ subunit with a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor nor deglycosylation of any of these proteins with tunicamycin or endoglycosidase H treatment abolished calnexin association. Using a cell-permeabilization system, we were unable to observe association of newly synthesized glycopeptides with calnexin, arguing that calnexin may not act like a simple lectin for association with glycoproteins. The results indicate that neither transmembrane regions nor N-linked glycans are exclusively responsible for calnexin association. Based on our data and the observations of others, we suggest that these features may have varying significance for different glycoproteins in determining their interaction with calnexin.

Proper conformational maturation of such proteins is vital for their function (1Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Eilers M.

Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Several monomeric and multimeric proteins in the ER have been shown to transiently associate with resident ER proteins, such as BiP/GRP78 and GRP94, collectively known as chaperones (reviewed in (6Gething M-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar) and (7Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Association of different proteins with such chaperones is transient, and their dissociation coincides with the folding, assembly, and transport of proteins(8Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T. Hartl F.U.

The chaperones are believed to exert a control on the interactions within and between polypeptides, thus limiting the formation of incorrect structures.

Recently, we reported the association of calnexin with MHC class II α and β chains, the associated invariant chain, and partially assembled αβ-invariant chain complexes(14Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). There are four forms of invariant chain (p33, p35, p41, and p43) in humans generated by the alternative initiation of translation (p33 versus p35 and p41 versus p43) and alternative splicing (p33 versus p41 and p35 versus p43)(18Strubin M.

In the absence of class II, p33 and p41 forms, which lack the N-terminal 16 residues, exit the ER, whereas the longer forms (p35 and p43) are retained(20Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T.

Similarly, class II α and β chains expressed alone remain in the ER. In normal circumstances, cells expressing all four isoforms of invariant chain generate mixed trimers that are retained in the ER(22Arunachalam B. Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Marks M.S. Blum J.S. Cresswell P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each invariant chain subunit is thought to bind to one MHC class II αβ dimer, forming a transport-efficient nonamer complex through a series of intermediates(24Roche P.A. Marks M.S. Cresswell P. Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 25Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3478-3482PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of the α and β chains is believed to mask the invariant chain ER retention signal, resulting in transport of the complex through the Golgi apparatus into the endocytic pathway. Calnexin associates with these chains individually and remains associated until the complete nonamer is formed(14Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Chaperones associate with a variety of newly synthesized proteins perhaps by recognizing some common feature(s). Recently, BiP has been shown to preferentially bind peptides containing a subset of aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids in alternating positions(26Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J.

Attempts have been made to find the feature that is recognized by calnexin. Using various truncated mutants of MHC class I heavy chain, Margolese et al.(27Margolese L. Waneck G.L. Suzuki C.K. Degen E. Flavell R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17959-17966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that replacement of the transmembrane segment and cytoplasmic domains of class I heavy chain with a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor resulted in loss of calnexin association. However, the same group observed that a soluble, truncated mutant of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) α chain lacking a transmembrane region retained a trace level of association with calnexin. Ou et al.(16Ou W-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) reported that preventing the glycosylation of secretory glycoproteins by tunicamycin treatment of cells abolished most calnexin association. Recently, Hammond et al.(15Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) reported that altering the glycosylation state of influenza hemagglutinin and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, either by tunicamycin treatment or by inhibiting the trimming of N-linked glycans by glucosidase inhibitors, resulted in complete loss of calnexin association, suggesting that calnexin may interact with the N-linked carbohydrates of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Here, we have analyzed this question using MHC class II α and β subunits and the associated invariant chain and report that neither the transmembrane region nor N-linked glycosylation of these proteins is exclusively responsible for their association with calnexin. However, both play a significant role. Based on our data and existing information in the literature, we propose that various features on glycoproteins are recognized by the calnexin. The transmembrane region, glycosylation state, or unidentified feature(s) may have varying significance for different proteins in establishing a detectable interaction, explaining the conflicting observations with different proteins. HeLa cells, the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line Swei, and the MHC class II-negative TxB hybrid line 174 X CEM.T2 (T2) were maintained at 37°C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 20 μg/ml gentamicin. The anti-calnexin monoclonal antibody AF8 was the generous gift of Dr. M. Brenner(12Hochstenbach F. David V. Watkins S. Brenner M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Drickamer (30Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3022-3029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding both the p33 and p35 forms of human invariant chain(31Strubin M. Mach B. Long E.O. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), p41 and p43 forms of human invariant chain, HLA-DRα chain (32Lee J.S. Trowsdale J. Travers P.J. Carey J.

Chem. 1981; 256: 5827-5839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the respective groups. cDNAs encoding only p33 and p41 forms of human invariant chain were generated by mutating the ATG initiating p35 and p43 translation into CTG on p35/33 and p43/41 cDNAs, respectively, by the Kunkel method (35Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Muta-gene kit (Bio-Rad). All the cDNAs were cloned into the pAR2529 vector under the control of the phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter (36Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 8: 8122-8126Crossref Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) and are referred pAR.p35/33, pAR.p33, pAR.43/41, pAR.p41, pAR.CHL, pAR.DRα, and pAR.DRβ. The cDNA construct (GPI-DRβ1) coding for a chimeric protein comprising the first two extracellular domains of DRβ1 fused with the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker derived from human placental alkaline phosphatase was a gift from Drs. Ed Collins and D. C. Wiley and was cloned in pcDNAI/Neo (Invitrogen) plasmid under the control of the phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The glycosylation substrate (RRYQNSTEL) was previously described(37Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It was synthesized by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). The peptide was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and shown to be single species by mass spectrometry. Iodination (125I) of the peptide was performed as described(38Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1990; 345: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Invariant chain isoforms, CHL, DRα, DRβ1, and GPI-DRβ1 were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using a vaccinia-based expression system. Cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase and then transfected with plasmids carrying cDNA for the proteins of interest under the control of phage T7 promoter. Replication of virus in cells results in the synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase, which in turn enhances the synthesis of mRNA from DNA that is under T7 promoter. Transient expression of specific proteins using recombinant vaccinia was achieved by following the protocol described earlier(21Lamb C.A. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5998-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent HeLa monolayer cultures were infected with vTF7-3 suspended in Opti-MEM at a multiplicity of infection of 20 for 30 min at 37°C. Excess virus was removed, and the infected cells were transfected with cDNAs in Opti-MEM using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). 3 h after infection, cells were cultured in medium containing 10% FCS. Cells (106-107) expressing specific proteins were deprived of methionine by incubation in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 3% dialyzed FCS for 1 h and then pulsed with [35S]methionine (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) (0.25-0.5 mCi) for 15-30 min. For chasing, the cells were washed after labeling and cultured in medium containing 10% FCS and 15-fold excess of non-radioactive methionine for different periods of time. Cells were extracted in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (TS), containing 1% digitonin (Wako, Richmond, VA), 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mMNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 5 mM iodoacetamide (IAA). Post-nuclear supernatants were precleared overnight with normal rabbit serum and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.) and were then precipitated with specific antibody and protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were washed three times with TS, 0.1% digitonin. Proteins bound to specific antibody in the first immunoprecipitation were eluted under denaturing conditions by adding 100 μl of TS containing 2% SDS with or without 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and boiling for 5 min. The supernatants were diluted with 1 ml of TS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM IAA, incubated for 45 min at 25°C, and then reprecipitated with antibody and protein G-Sepharose as described above. The precipitates were washed with TS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Native invariant chain was eluted from anti-calnexin immunoprecipitates by suspending the immunoprecipitates in 0.5 ml of 0.13 M NaCl, 0.02 M bicine, pH 8.2 (BS), containing 1% polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether (C12E9). After 15 min at 25°C, the beads were pelleted and re-eluted with 0.5 ml of 1% C12E9/BS. The supernatants were pooled and cross-linked by adding dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) (Sigma) to 200 μg/ml, quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 10 mM, and then precipitated as above. Calnexin and the associated glycoproteins in a digitonin extract of cells were precipitated with the anti-calnexin antibody (AF8) and protein G-Sepharose. Non-calnexin-associated proteins were subsequently precipitated from the same extract with specific antibody and protein G-Sepharose. These protein G-Sepharose beads were suspended in 150 μl of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with or without 4.5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H. After 16 h of incubation at 37°C, pellets and supernatants were analyzed for the presence of specific protein. In brief, proteins were eluted from washed beads under reducing condition and precipitated with a conformation-independent antibody specific for the protein expressed as described above. Similarly, protein from the supernatant was precipitated, and all proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). Metabolically labeled cells were extracted in 1% C12E9/BS containing 200 μg/ml DSP for 30 min at 4°C. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 10 mM, and then proteinase inhibitors were added. Precipitation was carried out as mentioned earlier, and samples were analyzed under reducing (10.5%) or non-reducing (6%) one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels. SDS-PAGE was performed as described(23Marks M.S. Blum J.S. Cresswell P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.) were used. The plasma membrane of Swei cells were permeabilized using activated streptolysin O (Murex, Norcross, GA), as previously described(39Androlewicz M.J. Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9130-9134Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 40Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed with cold serum-free medium and incubated with activated streptolysin O for 3 min. Permeabilized cells were resuspended in 1 ml of freshly prepared intracellular transport buffer (50 mM Hepes, 78 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 8.37 mM CaCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.0) and incubated for 10 min at 37°C with the 125I-labeled peptide derived from human histone at 50 nM final concentration. The peptide with an amino acid sequence RRYQNSTEL contains an N-glycosylation acceptor site. Cells were then washed once in 1 ml of fresh intracellular transport buffer and extracted in 1 ml of 1% digitonin/TS. The extract was precipitated with concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) or using different antibodies followed by Protein G-Sepharose beads. The pellets were washed three times in 1 ml of 0.1% digitonin/TS and counted in a γ counter (LKB Compugamma CS, Turku, Finland). Recently, Jackson et al.(41Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) showed that association of calnexin with murine class I heavy chain or peptide-deficient heavy chain-β2m heterodimers slowed their intracellular transport. Rajagopalan et al., using full-length and truncated versions of calnexin, demonstrated that the intracellular localization of associated CD3ϵ (42Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) or class I heavy chain (43Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) is determined by the associated calnexin. These groups suggested that calnexin acts as an ER-retention molecule for incompletely folded or misfolded proteins in the ER. An initial question we asked was whether calnexin acts as an ER-retention molecule for invariant chain by its specific association with the ER-retained forms p35 and p43 and not with the transport-efficient forms p33 and p41(22Arunachalam B. Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether each form of invariant chain can associate with calnexin, we expressed them individually using the vaccinia virus-based expression system in HeLa cells. Cells were radiolabeled 8 h post-infection with [35S]methionine for 30 min. They were extracted in 1% digitonin/TS and immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin (AF8) (Fig. 1, lanes1 and 3) and anti-invariant chain (PIN.1) (Fig. 1, lane2) antibodies. Bound proteins were stripped from protein G beads under denaturing conditions using DTT and SDS and reprecipitated with control antibodies (Fig. 1, lane1) or conformation-independent anti-invariant chain antibodies (Fig. 1, lanes2 and 3). While there is no band seen with the control antibody (Fig. 1, lane1), anti-invariant chain antibody brought down the invariant chain (Fig. 1, lane2), showing the specificity of the technique. Proteins eluted from the anti-calnexin antibody included invariant chain, which could be reprecipitated with specific antibody (Fig. 1, lane3). The presence of bands corresponding to invariant chain in lane3 of all of the panels clearly demonstrates that all of the isoforms of invariant chain associate with calnexin. The ratio of calnexin-bound invariant chain remains more or less the same with all the isoforms (data not shown). If calnexin were the major retention molecule keeping the p35 and p43 in the ER, its association with the transport-efficient p33 and p41 forms would not be expected. The association of calnexin with all of the forms suggests that calnexin is not the major ER-retention factor for the invariant chain. p33 and p41 forms of invariant chain presumably attain a transport-competent conformation, resulting in their release from calnexin. The presence of the additional 16 residues in the N-terminal domain of p35 and p43 perhaps prevents these forms from attaining a transport-competent conformation. Alternatively, a secondary mechanism involving the interaction of the added N-terminal sequence with a cytosolic molecule may be responsible for the retention of p35 and p43. We previously showed that the invariant chain forms trimers that may contain different isoforms(22Arunachalam B. Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In cross-linking experiments, we observed two prominent bands containing invariant chain. One had a molecular weight consistent with a trimer (I3) and the other a potential hexamer (I6) of invariant chain(22Arunachalam B. Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was also possible that this higher molecular weight species could result from calnexin association. We tested this using T2 cells, a mutant cell line expressing invariant chain but not MHC class II, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min and extracted in 1% C12E9/BS containing DSP. The precleared extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin (lanes1 and 3) or anti-invariant chain (lanes2 and 4) antibodies. The primary precipitates were eluted under non-reducing condition using SDS, and the supernatants reprecipitated with control (lane1), anti-invariant chain (lanes2 and 3), or anti-calnexin (lane4) antibodies. Samples were analyzed in 6 and 10.5% gels under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. When the primary and secondary precipitations were performed with anti-invariant chain antibodies, two bands were observed under non-reducing conditions (upperpanel, lane2). They had molecular masses of approximately 90 and 180 kDa, respectively. When the anti-calnexin antibody was used for primary (lane3) or for secondary precipitations (lane4), only the 180-kDa band was observed. We and others (16Ou W-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 22Arunachalam B. Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 44David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have observed that metabolically labeling calnexin is difficult due to its low turnover rate, which is why the invariant chain bands and not the calnexin band can be seen in lane4 in the reducing gel. The results argue that the higher molecular weight band represents an I3-calnexin complex. We obtained similar results using HeLa cells transiently expressing invariant chain isoforms (data not shown). We followed different strategies to determine whether the 180-kDa band is solely the result of an I3-calnexin complex or if it contains some genuine invariant chain hexamers. Initially, we attempted to preclear calnexin from cross-linked extracts by sequential immunoprecipitation using anti-calnexin antibodies. However, we were unable to completely deplete the sample of the 180-kDa band, perhaps because the antibody did not recognize all of the calnexin-containing complex (data not shown). Another approach was based on the observation that calnexin-invariant chain association is retained in digitonin and not in C12E9 or Triton X-100(14Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here, we labeled invariant chain-positive, class II-negative T2 cells for 15 min and extracted them in 1% digitonin/TS. Proteins were precipitated with anti-calnexin antibody (Fig. 3, lanes1 and 2) and dissociated from calnexin using C12E9. They were then cross-linked with DSP. Dissociated materials were reprecipitated with control (Fig. 3, lane1) or anti-invariant chain (Fig. 3, lane2) antibodies. Samples were analyzed in 6 and 10.5% gels under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. This procedure yields less material than stripping with SDS. However, unlike in Fig. 2, only the 90-kDa trimer band and no 180-kDa band was observed (Fig. 3, lane2) under non-reducing conditions. This suggests that no hexameric invariant chain associates with calnexin. In addition, preliminary experiments in which invariant chain multimers were studied in a calnexin-negative mutant cell line showed only the 90-kDa trimer band (data not shown). We therefore believe that the invariant chain does not form genuine hexamers. Calnexin associates rapidly with newly synthesized DRα, β, and invariant chains. Invariant chain is a type II membrane protein with two N-linked glycans, and DRα and β chains are type I membrane proteins with two and one N-linked glycans, respectively. We expressed individually these proteins and another type II membrane protein, CHL, in HeLa cel"

https://openalex.org/W2067536393,"Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and other mammals in which disease appears to be caused by the accumulation of an abnormal form of a host protein, prion protein (PrP), in the brain and other tissues. The process by which the normal protease-sensitive form of PrP is converted into the abnormal protease-resistant form is unknown. Several hypotheses predict that oligomeric forms of either the normal or abnormal PrP may act as intermediates in the conversion process. We have now identified a 60-kDa PrP derived from hamster PrP expressed in murine neuroblastoma cells. Peptide mapping studies provided evidence that the 60-kDa PrP was composed solely of PrP and, based on its molecular mass, appeared to be a PrP dimer. The 60-kDa PrP was not dissociated under several harsh denaturing conditions, which indicated that it was covalently linked. It was similar to the disease-associated form of PrP in that it formed large aggregates. However, it resembled the normal form of PrP in that it was sensitive to proteinase K and had a short metabolic half-life. The 60-kDa PrP, therefore, had characteristics of both the normal and disease-associated forms of PrP. Formation and aggregation of the 60-kDa hamster PrP occurs in uninfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, which suggests that hamster PrP has a predisposition to aggregate even in the absence of scrapie infectivity. Similar 60-kDa PrP bands were identified in scrapie-infected hamster brain but not in uninfected brain. Therefore, a 60-kDa molecule might participate in the scrapie-associated conversion of protease-sensitive PrP to protease-resistant PrP."

The molecular details of these events are obscure and will require a detailed understanding of the structure function relationships of the protein, in particular those of the extracellular domain.The primary structure of this region has been deduced from the predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned human insulin receptor cDNA (2Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.-W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J.

It is composed of two disulfide-linked heterodimers, each of which is composed in turn of an Mr 135,000 α subunit, which is entirely extracellular, linked by a disulfide bond to an Mr 95,000 β subunit, which has an extracellular domain, a single α helical transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain containing the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity. The α subunit contains a cysteine-rich domain homologous to that of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and there are also possibly two fibronectin type III repeats in the extracellular domain(4Schaefer E.M. Erickson H.P. Federwisch M. Wollmer A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23393-23402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Bajaj et al.(5Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have proposed a hypothetical model of the tertiary structure of the receptor extracellular domain based on homologies between the primary structures of the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptor families of tyrosine kinases(5Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This model predicts that there are two homologous globular domains flanking the cysteine domains: domain L1 containing amino acids 1-119 and domain L2 containing amino acids 311-428. Each contains repeating structural motifs (Motifs I-V) composed of α helix, β turn β, and hypervariable structures. Since all deletions and insertions occur in the hypervariable structures in the sequence alignments obtained for these proteins with this model, it was suggested that these may represent components of ligand binding domains.For the insulin receptor this proposal has received support from recent experimental observations. Affinity labeling studies and mutagenic analyses suggest the involvement of both the NH2 terminus of the molecule (6Wedekind F. Baer-Pontzen K. Bala-Mohan S. Choli D. Zahn H. Brandenburg D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Waugh S.M. DiBella E.E. Pilch P.F.

Brandenburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8950-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in insulin binding. Furthermore, studies of the ligand properties of chimeric receptors produced from the insulin and the related IGF-1 receptors indicate that residues 1-68 (9Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C.

Soos M.A. Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Siddle K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are involved in conferring ligand specificity, although the role of the latter residues is probably minor. In addition point mutations of amino acids located within the L1 domain, Asn-15 (11Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Accili D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19143-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Phe-89(12DeMeyts P. Gu J.L. Shymko R.M. Kaplan B.E. Bell G.I. Whittaker J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Schumacher R. Mosthaf L. Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19288-19295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to compromise high affinity insulin binding.In view of this compelling evidence for the involvement of the L1 domain of the insulin receptor in ligand binding, we have undertaken, in the present study, a high resolution analysis of the residues involved by alanine scanning mutagenesis as a first step in elucidating the detailed mechanism of insulin receptor signal transduction. Since studies of insulin structure function relationships suggest a prominent role for aromatic residues in receptor interactions(14Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodon G.G. Crowfoot Hodgkin D.M. Hubbard R.E. Isaacs N.W. Reynolds C.D. Sakabe K. Sakabe N. Vijayan N.M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 319: 369-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), we performed both aromatic to alanine and charged to alanine mutagenesis. The results of these experiments indicate that the L1 domain of the insulin receptor contains an insulin binding site composed of four discontinuous polypeptide segments containing 14 amino acids, the mutation of which compromised insulin binding.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneral ProceduresAll molecular biological procedures, including agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing, were performed by standard methods(15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 391A PCR Mate synthesizer. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Porcine insulin was purchased from Bios Pacific (Emeryville, CA), and insulin radioiodinated at tyrosine A-14 of the A chain 125I-[Tyr-A14]insulin ( 1The abbreviations used are: 125I-[Tyr-A14]insulininsulin radioiodinated at tyrosine 14 of the A-polypeptide chainEBVEpstein-Barr virus. )was from Amersham Corp. Protease inhibitors were from Boehringer Mannheim. 293 EBNA cells were purchased from InVitrogen (San Diego, CA). Media for tissue culture was from Mediatech (Herndon, VA) and serum from Sigma. Anti-insulin receptor monoclonal antibody 18-44 (16Soos M.A. Siddle K. Stanley K.K. Baron M.D. Heward J.M. Luzio J.P. Bellatin J. Lennox E.S. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Drs. M. Soos and K. Siddle (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom).Oligonucleotide-directed MutagenesisOligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel(17Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). A 1.9-kilobase pair fragment of the human insulin receptor cDNA extending from a Kozak consensus initiation sequence preceded by a HindIII restriction site to the BamHI restriction site (18Whittaker J. Okamoto A.K. Thys R. Bell G.I. Steiner D.F. Hofmann C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) subcloned into the phagemid pTZ18U was used as the template for mutagenesis. Where possible, restriction sites were deleted or introduced with the specific mutation in order to permit enrichment of mutants by restriction selection or purification and to facilitate the screening of mutants.Expression of Mutant Insulin Receptor cDNAsThe mutant insulin receptor cDNAs encoding a secreted receptor extracellular domain were reconstructed in the expression vector pCDE. This a modification of pCEP4 (InVitrogen) from which the coding region for the EBV nuclear antigen has been deleted; thus, this vector contains the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter for the expression of cloned cDNAs, the EBV origin of replication for episomal replication in cells expressing EBV nuclear antigen, and a hygromycin resistance gene for the selection of stable cell lines.These constructs were expressed in 293EBNA cells (an adenovirus transformed human kidney cell line expressing EBV nuclear antigen) by transfection with 2 μg of Miniprep DNA using the commercially available lipofection reagent Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers' directions. For analysis of transient expression, media and cells were harvested 1 week after transfection. Conditioned medium was concentrated prior to assay using Centriprep 100 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA).We chose to utilize the extracellular domain for these experiments, as it is expressed in large amounts by this expression system, and insulin only binds to a single homogeneous population of binding sites in this protein which have been shown to be contained within the L1 domain(9Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. M⊘ller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus simplifying the analysis of binding data.Insulin Binding AssaysSoluble insulin receptor binding assays were performed using a microtiter plate antibody capture assay. Microtiter plates (Immulon 4, Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) were incubated with affinity purified goat anti-mouse IgG (50 μl/well of 20 μg/ml solution in 0.2 M sodium carbonate, pH 9.4) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing and blocking for 15 min with 250 μl of SuperBlock™ (Pierce), wells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with a 1:100 dilution of crude ascites of anti-insulin receptor monoclonal antibody 18-44 in SuperBlock™. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, wells were incubated for 4h at 4°C with soluble receptor, diluted to give 10-20%125I-[Tyr-A14]insulin binding in the absence of added unlabeled insulin under assay conditions. After washing with wash buffer (0.15 M sodium chloride, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), and 0.02% sodium azide (w/v)), wells were incubated overnight at 4°C with 125I-[Tyr-A14]insulin (50 pM) and varying concentrations of unlabeled insulin, in 100 μl of binding buffer. To terminate the assay, wells were aspirated and washed three times with 300 μl of ice-cold wash buffer and then counted.Insulin binding data were analyzed by the LIGAND program (20Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar) in order to obtain the Kd of the expressed protein. Trasfection and binding assays were repeated at least once to confirm the Kd of each mutant. Each result is the mean of two experiments.ImmunoblottingImmunoblotting of the insulin receptor α subunit in conditioned medium and detergent lysates of transfected cells was performed according to standard methods using a commercially available antibody directed toward the C terminus of the α subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham).RESULTSAs described previously, insulin binding to recombinant insulin receptor extracellular domain secreted by transiently transfected 293EBNA cells displayed simple kinetics with a linear Scatchard plot (data not shown)(19Markussen J. Halstrom J. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18814-18818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis with the LIGAND program (20Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar) indicated a single population of binding sites with a Kd of 1.41 ± 0.09 × 10-9M (mean ± S.E., n = 6). Since previous studies utilizing alanine scanning mutagenesis have demonstrated that meaningful changes in affinity produced by a single alanine substitution range from 2- to 100-fold (21Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), in the experiments described below we regarded any mutant with a greater than 2-fold increase in Kd, i.e.Kd greater than 2.8 × 10-9M, as causing a significant disruption in insulin-receptor interactions.The initial mutants analyzed were clustered charged/aromatic mutations. The results of these analyses are shown in Table 1, part A. None of these mutants displayed any abnormality except the the receptor with the simultaneous mutation of Phe-64 and Arg-65 (A64F/A65R), which did not appear to be secreted although Western blotting of lysates of the transfected cells revealed detectable levels of receptor precursor (data not shown), a pattern of disruption of post-translational processing indicative of impaired folding of the nascent proreceptor(11Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Accili D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19143-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schaefer E.M. Siddle K. Ellis L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13248-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of Phe-64 and Arg-65 were therefore analyzed individually (see below).Tabled 1We then proceeded to perform alanine scanning mutagenesis of individual charged amino acids (Table 1, part B). This identified Arg-14 as a major determinant of insulin binding; mutation of this residue to alanine led to the expression of a receptor whose affinity for insulin was too low to be measured by the methodology used for this study. In the same region mutation of D12 to alanine produced a 5-fold reduction in affinity for insulin (Kd = 9.12 × 10-9M). A further mutation of Glu-44 to alanine caused a 3-4 fold decrease in affinity (Kd = 6.82 × 10-9M). Mutation of Arg-65 to alanine had no effect on expression or secretion of the resulting protein, and its affinity for insulin was normal. Mutation of Glu97 resulted in impaired receptor secretion, although the precursor of this mutant protein was detectable by immunoblotting of lysates of transfected cells (data not shown), again suggesting malfolding of the mutant.We next undertook aromatic to alanine mutagenesis (Table 1, part C). This revealed 4 additional residues whose mutation significantly compromised insulin binding; Phe-39 (Kd = 35.70 × 10-9M), Phe-64 (affinity too low to be accurately measured), Phe-89 (Kd = 5.17 × 10-9M), and Tyr-91 (Kd = 3.85 × 10-9M). Phe-39 is located in a region that has previously been reported to be important for conferring insulin specificity in studies of the binding properties of chimeric insulin-IGF-1 receptors(9Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. M⊘ller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phe-89 has also previously been reported to be important for high affinity insulin binding(12DeMeyts P. Gu J.L. Shymko R.M. Kaplan B.E. Bell G.I. Whittaker J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Schumacher R. Mosthaf L. Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19288-19295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr-60 and Phe-96 led to a failure of secretion into the medium although the presence of their precursors were visualized in cell lysates by Western blotting (data not shown), suggesting that these mutations compromise the structure of the receptor. It is of interest that Phe-96 is a neighbor of Glu-97 whose mutation to alanine also caused impaired expression in the charged to alanine mutagenesis experiments, suggesting the importance of this region for folding of the molecule into a native conformation. These residues are conserved in the insulin receptor, the IGF-1 receptor, and the insulin receptor-related protein(23Shier P. Watt V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14605-14608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further emphasizing their critical roles in the maintenance of the conformation of this family of proteins.To further define the structures in which alanine mutations compromised binding, we mutated amino acids surrounding those that we had previously identified as being necessary for high affinity binding. To avoid potential structural perturbations, we did not mutate prolines, cysteines, or potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The results of these scans confirmed that the insulin binding epitope was composed of four discontinuous peptide segments; Segment 1 from Asp-12 to Asn-15, Segment 2 from Gln-34 to Glu-44, Segment 3 from Phe-64 to Tyr-67, and Segment 4 from Phe-89 to Tyr-91 (see Table 1, part D, and Fig. 1). In Segment 1, mutations produced decreases in affinity ranging from 6- to 7-fold (D12A) to too low to accurately determine (R14A).In the the second segment, mutations produced 3-fold (M38A) to 25-fold (F39A) reductions in affinity. In addition, mutations L33A, I35A, and L37A led to a failure of secretion of protein, although expression of precursor is detectable in cell lysates (data not shown). Mutations K40A, T41A, and R42A were without effect on insulin binding. In Segment 3 only mutations F64A and Y67A reduced affinity for insulin (too low to be determined and 2.2-fold, respectively). Mutations R65A and V66A produced receptors with normal affinity for insulin. In Segment 4 mutations reduced affinity from 2.5-fold (Y91A) to 6-fold (N90A).Figure 1:Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the NH2-terminal ligand binding site of the recombinant secreted insulin receptor. Data from Table 1 are expressed as a ratio of the Kd of the mutant to that of wild type recombinant insulin receptor (Kd(mut)/Kd(wt)). Results for amino acids 1-60 are shown in the upperpanel and those for amino acids 61-120 in the lowerpanel. Amino acids are designated by single-letter code. The Kd(mut)/Kd(wt) could not be accurately determined for mutations of Arg-14 and Phe-64 (designated by ∗). Kd(mut)/Kd(wt) for the mutation of N15 is 250 as indicated on the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have identified 14 amino acids organized into four discontinuous segments, which appear to be the major functional determinants of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the insulin receptor - Segment 1 (Asp-12, Ile-13, Arg-14, and Asn-15), Segment 2 (Gln-34, Leu-36, Met-38, Phe-39, and Glu-44), Segment 3 (Phe-64 and Tyr-67), and Segment 4 (Phe-89, Asn-90, and Tyr-91). Of the 14 amino acids, 3 are charged, 3 hydrophobic, 5 aromatic, and 3 are amides. The prominence of the aromatic residues further emphasizes the role of aromatic interactions in insulin receptor interactions. The predicted secondary structure of the four segments according to the model of Bajaj et al.(5Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is: Segment 1: β strand, α helix (Motifs I and II, respectively); Segment 2: β strand, loop (Motif II); Segment 3: loop (Motif III); Segment 4: loop (Motif IV).Thus, as suggested by these authors, the predicted loop structures appear to play a prominent role in ligand binding. However, in contrast to immunoglobulins(24Mariuzza R.A. Phillips S.E. Poljak R.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 139-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the ligand binding epitope is not confined to these structures as both predicted β strand and α helical structures are also involved. Precedents for this have been reported for the growth hormone receptor(21Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that the decreases in affinity observed with these mutations are probably direct effects on ligand receptor interactions rather than the consequences of misfolding of the mutant proteins. Previous analyses of protein structure and function have shown that the effects of alanine mutants tend to be localized and nondisruptive of global protein structure(21Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the case of the growth hormone-growth hormone receptor interactions, crystallographic studies have confirmed the involvement of determinants identified by scanning mutagenesis in hormone receptor interactions(25de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Second, in common with other membrane and secreted proteins (for review, see (26de Silva A.M. Balch W.E. Helenius A.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), studies of naturally occurring mutants of the insulin receptor associated with extreme insulin resistance (11Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Accili D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19143-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of secreted COOH-terminal deletion mutants of the receptor (22Schaefer E.M. Siddle K. Ellis L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13248-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that there is a strict requirement for folding into a native conformation prior to completion of post-translational processing and transport to the membrane or secretion. In the present study, all the mutants disruptive of insulin binding were secreted at levels comparable to that of the wild type protein and those of mutants that were without effect on insulin binding.Of the four segments that we have identified, Segment 1 appears to be quantitatively the most important in its contribution to the free energy of binding, probably followed by Segment 3, and then 2, with the smallest contribution coming from Segment 4. Mutation of Arg-14 to alanine results in a receptor with an unmeasurably low affinity and mutation of Asn-15 to alanine producing a greater than 200-fold decrease. Interestingly a mutation at this position has been identified in a patient with extreme insulin resistance(11Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Accili D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19143-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this mutant the asparagine was mutated to lysine and resulted in impaired folding of the receptor and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, those receptors that did reach the cell membrane exhibited a 5-fold decrease in affinity for insulin. In contrast the substitution of alanine results in the expression of a protein that appears to have native structure, since it is secreted in quantities comparable to that of the wild type receptor and post-translational processing does not appear to be impaired. The alanine substitution, however, produced a much more profound decrease in affinity than the lysine substitution, presumably because of the loss of the side chain. Phe-64 in segment 3 also appears to make a contribution to the free energy of binding comparable to that of Arg-14. However, accurate determination of the affinity of these residues will be required before we can definitively evaluate their relative contributions to the free energy of insulin binding.Studies of insulin and IGF-1 specificity with chimeric receptors have identified amino acids 1-68 as being the major determinant of insulin specificity of the secreted soluble receptor(9Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. M⊘ller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this region it appears that amino acid differences in the region 38-68 are the most important. Thus, on the basis of the results of our scanning mutagenesis, one would predict Met-38, Phe-39, and Tyr-67 to be the major determinants of specificity with the major energetic contribution being provided by Phe-39. Certainly the combined effects of mutation of these residues to alanine are consistent with the observed differences in affinities between the secreted recombinant insulin and IGF-1 receptors for insulin (9Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. M⊘ller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (assuming that resulting free energy changes of the combined mutations are additive; (27Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 37: 8509-8517Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The data acquired from scanning mutagenesis also allow us to predict the residues in the insulin receptor-related protein that contribute to the low affinity of this protein for insulin. There are significant sequence differences between the two proteins in Segments 1 and 4(23Shier P. Watt V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14605-14608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Segment 1, Asn-15 of the insulin receptor is replaced by serine in the insulin receptor related protein; and in epitope 4, Phe-89 and Asn-90 of the insulin receptor are replaced by leucine and glycine, respectively. The combination of these substitutions is likely to cause a profound decrease in affinity for insulin. Experiments are currently in progress to test these predictions.While it should be noted that these results were obtained with a recombinant receptor that has an affinity at least an order of magnitude lower than that of wild type receptor(28Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), there are good reasons to believe that the results can be extrapolated to the native receptor. Recently two models have been proposed to explain the complex kinetics of insulin binding(28Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Both propose that there are two distinct receptor binding sites on the insulin molecule and that there are two distinct insulin binding sites on each α subunit, Site 1 and Site 2. Insulin first binds to the site with higher affinity, Site 1, on one α subunit and then cross-links the two heterodimers by binding to Site 2 on the second α subunit, generating the high affinity component of the receptor interaction. Binding of a second insulin molecule in this manner disrupts the cross-linking of the first and accelerates its dissociation (negative cooperativity). In the recombinant secreted receptor and the isolated heterodimer, insulin only binds to Site 1, and hence this interaction displays a lower affinity than that of the native receptor and simple binding kinetics. From the data presented by Shaffer, it is apparent that the affinity of Site 1 is very much greater than that of Site 2. Thus it would be expected mutations producing changes in the affinity of this binding site for insulin, in the recombinant secreted receptor would also produce comparable changes in affinity of the holoreceptor. This conclusion is supported by experimental evidence for Segments 2-4. It has been reported that the relative increase in affinity for insulin of chimeric IGF-1 receptors in which amino acids 1-62 have been substituted by the corresponding region of the insulin receptor is comparable for both the secreted and full-length recombinant proteins, suggesting that the contributions to the free energy of binding of Met-38, Phe-39, and Tyr-67 that we have demonstrated will be comparable in the both forms of the receptor. Additionally, Schumacher et al.(13Schumacher R. Mosthaf L. Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19288-19295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have studied the properties of the F89A mutation in the holoreceptor, and the changes in affinity that they reported are very similar to those we have found for the secreted form of this mutant.This study thus confirms the utility of alanine scanning mutagenesis for the investigation of insulin-receptor interactions. This approach is has enabled us to map a discontinuous epitope of the insulin receptor involved in insulin binding, which contains polypeptide segments that would have escaped attention using previously employed systematic mutagenic approaches. However, while this analysis implies direct molecular interactions between this epitope and the insulin molecule, it does not provide proof of such interactions. Direct proof will require a high resolution structural analysis. INTRODUCTIONInsulin initiates signal transduction in target cells by binding to a specific cell surface receptor(1Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This probably leads to conformational changes in the extracellular domains, which are transmitted across the cell membrane and result in activation of the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity. The molecular details of these events are obscure and will require a detailed understanding of the structure function relationships of the protein, in particular those of the extracellular domain.The primary structure of this region has been deduced from the predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned human insulin receptor cDNA (2Ebina Y.

It is composed of two disulfide-linked heterodimers, each of which is composed in turn of an Mr 135,000 α subunit, which is entirely extracellular, linked by a disulfide bond to an Mr 95,000 β subunit, which has an extracellular domain, a single α helical transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain containing the tyrosine kinase catalytic activity. The α subunit contains a cysteine-rich domain homologous to that of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and there are also possibly two fibronectin type III repeats in the extracellular domain(4Schaefer E.M.

Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This model predicts that there are two homologous globular domains flanking the cysteine domains: domain L1 containing amino acids 1-119 and domain L2 containing amino acids 311-428. Each contains repeating structural motifs (Motifs I-V) composed of α helix, β turn β, and hypervariable structures. Since all deletions and insertions occur in the hypervariable structures in the sequence alignments obtained for these proteins with this model, it was suggested that these may represent components of ligand binding domains.For the insulin receptor this proposal has received support from recent experimental observations. Affinity labeling studies and mutagenic analyses suggest the involvement of both the NH2 terminus of the molecule (6Wedekind F. Baer-Pontzen K. Bala-Mohan S. Choli D. Zahn H. Brandenburg D. Biol.

In addition point mutations of amino acids located within the L1 domain, Asn-15 (11Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Accili D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

Since studies of insulin structure function relationships suggest a prominent role for aromatic residues in receptor interactions(14Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J.

The results of these experiments indicate that the L1 domain of the insulin receptor contains an insulin binding site composed of four discontinuous polypeptide segments containing 14 amino acids, the mutation of which compromised insulin binding."

INTRODUCTIONThe thrombospondins are a family of extracellular calcium binding proteins (for a review, see Adams and Lawler (1993a) and Bornstein (1992)). Thrombospondin-1 has been shown to modulate cell attachment, spreading, migration, and proliferation of various cell types in vitro. Thrombospondin-1 is expressed in many embryonic and adult tissues. By contrast, thrombospondin-4 appears to be specific to cardiac and skeletal muscle (Lawler et al., 1993a). Thrombospondin-4 was identified as cDNA clones from a Xenopus laevis stage 45 library. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that the thrombospondin-4 mRNA encodes for a peptide of 106,326 daltons. It is distinct from thrombospondin-1 and −2 in that it lacks the procollagen homology region and the type 1 repeats and has an additional type 2 repeat. The amino acid sequences indicate that thrombospondin-3 and −4 have a similar composition of structural motifs (Bornstein et al., 1993; Qabar et al., 1994). Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) ( 1The abbreviations used are: COMPcartilage oligomeric matrix proteinTBSTris-buffered saline (pH 7.6)TPCK-trysinL-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. )is also similar but lacks the NH2-terminal domain of approximately 200 amino acids that is present in all of the thrombospondins that have been sequenced to date (Oldberg et al., 1992).We have recently shown that thrombospondin-4 is present in the human genome (Lawler et al., 1993b). Evolutionary comparison of the thrombospondins by progressive sequence alignment using parsimony-based algorithms indicates that the primordial genes that gave rise to the modern thrombospondin genes diverged over 900 million years ago (Lawler et al., 1993b). Subsequent gene duplications have given rise to the known members of the thrombospondin gene family, thrombospondin-1, −2, −3, and −4, and COMP.The structural and functional properties of thrombospondin-1 have been extensively characterized (for reviews see Adams and Lawler (1993a) and Bornstein(1992)). Thrombospondin-1 is composed of 140,000-dalton polypeptides that migrate with an apparent molecular weight of 185,000 on a discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel system (Lawler and Hynes, 1986). The thrombospondin-1 polypeptides assemble to form a trimeric molecule with a molecular weight of 420,000. Thrombospondin-1 and −2 form homo- and heterotrimers (O'Rourke et al., 1992). COMP is a 100,000-120,000-dalton polypeptide that has been isolated from bovine cartilage (Hedborn et al., 1992). In the absence of reducing agent, the protein migrates with a molecular weight that is consistent with a pentameric structure (Hedborn et al., 1992; Morgelin et al., 1992). This conclusion is consistent with electron microscopic images that reveal a structure with five subunits that are similar in appearance to the thrombospondin-1 subunits but that have some differences in dimensions (Morgelin et al., 1992).In this paper, we report on the cloning, sequencing, and expression of human thrombospondin-4. A full-length cDNA construct has been used to express human thrombospondin-4 in mouse fibroblast and myoblast cell lines. The recombinant protein has a subunit molecular weight of 140,000. Electron microscopy and SDS-PAGE indicate that the thrombospondin-4 peptides assemble to form pentamers. Whereas the structure of thrombospondin-4 is distinct from thrombospondin-1, both molecules bind heparin and calcium.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Sequencing of Human Thrombospondin-4A cDNA clone, designated hTSP4-9, that contains the 3′ end of the human thrombospondin-4 sequence was isolated from a human heart library and was described previously (Lawler et al., 1993b). This sequence was identified as the human homolog of Xenopus laevis thrombospondin-4 using two phylogenetic analysis programs (Lawler et al., 1993b). A 400-base pair EcoRI to BamHI fragment from the 5′ end of this clone was used to rescreen the human adult heart cDNA library (the generous gift of Dr. Paul Allen). The probe was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP, and hybridization was performed using the Genius kit following the supplier's protocols (Boehringer Mannheim). Positive plaques were taken through successive rounds of screening with the same probe at progressively lower plaque densities. Because the library was constructed in the λZAP II vector, pBluescript II SK clones that contained the inserts were excised with helper phage and grown up directly following the supplier's protocols (Stratagene). One of the twelve clones, designated hTSP4-11, contained sequence that extended beyond the 5′ end of the signal sequence based on similarity to the X. laevis sequence (Fig. 1) (Lawler et al., 1993a). This clone and the original clone were used to determine the sequence on both strands using the chain termination method of Sanger et al.(1977) with Sequenase reagents (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Production of AntiserumThe COOH-terminal 14 amino acids (FQEFQTQNFDRFDN) of the predicted amino acid sequence of human thrombospondin-4 was synthesized with a cysteine at the amino-terminal for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as protein carriers (Immuno-Dynamics Inc., La Jolla, CA). Two rabbits were immunized interdermally with peptide-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (2.5 mg) emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. Booster injections were made intramuscularly with conjugate emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Production of antibody was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the peptide conjugated to BSA and absorbed to plastic. Antisera, designated 1258 and 1259, from both rabbits gave a strong response at dilutions up to 1:100,000 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both antibodies also stained thrombospondin-4 protein in Western blot protocols (see “Results”).Production of Fusion ProteinThe clone hTSP4-9 was ligated into the EcoRI site of the bacterial expression vector pGEX1. This clone contains the 3′ end of the human thrombospondin-4 sequence and includes the peptide that was used to produce the antiserum. The glutathione S-transferase control and the fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and thrombospondin-4 were induced with IPTG and purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as described previously (Adams and Lawler, 1993b).Transfection and Tissue CultureA cDNA clone that contains the complete coding sequence of human thrombospondin-4 was constructed by cloning an EcoRV fragment of clone hTSP4-9 between EcoRV sites in clone hTSP4-11 in the coding region and the polylinker (Fig. 1). A mixture of the thrombospondin-4 expression vector (pTSP4, 5-10 μg) and pSV2neo (0.5-1.0 μg) was transfected into NIH3T3 cells using the Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) protocol. Subsequent cell culture and selection of clones was performed as described previously (Lawler et al., 1992). To produce culture supernatant for analysis and purification of thrombospondin-4, the cells were grown to confluence in four T75 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Fresh medium was placed on the cells, and the cells were grown for 48 h. The conditioned medium was removed, diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added to 1 mM and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 5 mM. After several hours at 0°C, the culture supernatants were frozen and stored at −20°C.Purification of Recombinant Thrombospondin-4Culture supernatant (800-1200 ml) was fractionated on a column (4-6 ml) of heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech). After application of the sample, the column was eluted stepwise with 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 0.02% NaN3, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.15 M NaCl, 0.25 M NaCl, or 0.55 M NaCl. The fractions that were eluted with 0.55 M NaCl were pooled and treated with 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate and then applied to a column (2 ml) of antibody 1259 immunoglobulins conjugated to Affi-Gel HZ (Bio-Rad). The immunoglobulins were purified from the antiserum 1259 by fractionation on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia). The immunoglobulins were eluted from the column with pH 3.0 citrate/citric acid buffer and collected into tubes containing 0.1 ml of 1.0 M Tris (pH 9.5). The immunoglobulins were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline and coupled to Affi-Gel HZ according to the supplier's protocols (Bio-Rad). The thrombospondin-4 was eluted with glycine buffer (pH 2.5) containing 1 mM CaCl2 and immediately dialyzed into 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 (TBS) containing 2 mM CaCl2.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)One- dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out using the discontinuous system of Laemmli(1970) as described previously (Lawler et al., 1985). The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) or Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes and probed with the polyclonal antibodies 1258 and 1259 as described previously (Lawler et al., 1985). The bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cooper Biomedical Inc., West Chester, PA).Electron MicroscopyThrombospondin-4 in TBS containing 2 mM CaCl2 was diluted 1:5 or 1:10 with 70% glycerol, 0.15 M ammonium acetate, and 0.2 mM CaCl2 just prior to spraying. A parallel sample was adjusted to 5 mM in EDTA prior to mixing with 70% glycerol and 0.15 M ammonium acetate prepared without CaCl2. The samples were sprayed and rotary-shadowed with platinum from an angle of 6° to the horizontal by the method of Tyler and Branton(1980). A shadow thickness of approximately 12 Å was used. Replicas were coated with a 100-Å thick supporting film of carbon from an angle of 90°.RESULTSThe Sequence of Human Thrombospondin-4The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of human thrombospondin-4 is shown in Fig. 2. An open reading frame that is 961 amino acids long is predicted from the nucleotide sequence. The 3′-untranslated region is approximately 150 nucleotides long and contains a consensus polyadenylation sequence (AATAAA). Based on a message size of 3.4 kilobases, the 5′-untranslated region is approximately 350 base pairs long. The first 21 amino acids appear to comprise a signal sequence. The predictive algorithm of von Heijne(1986) indicates that the signal sequence would be cleaved after alanine(−1) and that alanine(+1) is the NH2-terminal of the mature human thrombospondin-4 peptide (Fig. 2). The mature human thrombospondin-4 peptide has a calculated molecular weight of 106,326.Figure 2The sequence of human thrombospondin-4.

Like other members of the thrombospondin gene family, the level of identity is lower at the NH2-terminal (52.3% for residues 1 to 220) than at the COOH-terminal (92.3% for residues 721 to 940). The human sequence contains three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation although one of these also fits the consensus sequence for β-hydroxylation within epidermal growth factor repeats (Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981; Stenflo et al., 1988). The second and third type 2, epidermal growth factor-like repeats of both human and X. laevis thrombospondin-4 contain potential sites for β-hydroxylation.Human thrombospondin-4 contains an RGD sequence in the third type 3 repeat (Fig. 2). The only other members of the thrombospondin gene family that have an RGD sequence in this position are human and bovine COMP (Morgelin et al. 1992; Newton et al., 1994). However, the RGD sequence that is present in all of the thrombospondin-1 and −2 proteins is in an equivalent position in the seventh type 3 repeat (Lawler et al., 1993b).Expression of Recombinant Thrombospondin-4The antibodies 1258 and 1259 reacted with the COOH-terminal peptide in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). On Western blots, these antibodies bind specifically to a fusion protein that contained the COOH-terminal globular domain of human thrombospondin-4, but do not bind to the glutathione S-transferase control (Fig. 3). The preimmune sera from both antibodies did not produce any staining (Fig. 3).Figure 3Immunoblot of fusion proteins with antibody 1259. The human thrombospondin-4 fusion protein (lanes b, d, and f) or the glutathione S-transferase control (lanes c, e, and g) were electrophoresed on a 3-10% gradient gel. A portion of the gel (lanes a;enc) was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the remainder (lanes d-g) was transferred to Immobilon-P. The transfer was divided, and lanes d and e were probed with the preimmune serum from rabbit 1259 at a 1:1000 dilution, and lanes f and g were probed with immune serum from rabbit 1259 at a 1:1000 dilution. The molecular weight standards (lane a) are: 1, myosin, 200,000; 2, β-galactosidase, 116,000; 3, phosphorylase b, 97,400; 4, BSA, 66,200; and 5, ovalbumin, 45,000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the culture supernatant from NIH3T3 or C2C12 cells that have been transfected with pTSP4 is transferred to Immobilon-P and probed with these antibodies, a polypeptide of 140,000 daltons is specifically stained (Fig. 4). In addition, a band with a molecular weight of 120,000 is variably observed (Fig. 4). The preimmune serum from both antibodies did not stain these bands (data not shown). Since the staining was more intense with antibody 1259, it was used for all subsequent studies. Neither the 140,000- nor the 120,000-dalton polypeptides are observed in the media (Fig. 4, lane a) or in the culture supernatant from NIH3T3 cells that are transfected with the pLEN-PT vector that did not contain an insert (Fig. 4, lane b). Equivalent staining patterns are observed when the expression construct is transfected into NIH3T3 (Fig. 4, lane c) or C2Cl2 (Fig. 4, lane d).Figure 4Immunoblot of recombinant thrombospondin-4. The culture supernatant from individual clones of NIH3T3 cells (lanes c and g) and C2C12 cells (lanes d and h) that were transfected with pTSP4 were electrophoresed in the presence (lanes c and d) and absence (lanes g and h) of reducing agent. Note that the C2C12-derived culture supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of TBS to reduce the serum content to 10%. Media containing 10% serum (lanes a and e) and the culture supernatant from NIH 3T3 cells that were transfected with pLEN-PT vector without an insert (lanes b and f) were electrophoresed in the presence (lanes a and b) and absence (lanes e and f) of reducing agent as a control.

The molecular weights of the principal band are indicated on the right ×10-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the absence of reducing agents, bands with apparent molecular weights of 550,000, 125,000, and 90,000 are observed in the transfected NIH3T3 (Fig. 4, lane g) and C2C12 (Fig. 4, lane h) cells. A variable amount of a band with a molecular weight of 145,000 is also observed. The 125,000-dalton protein is also present at variable levels in the media (Fig. 4, lane e), and the culture supernatant from NIH3T3 cells that are transfected with pLEN-PT without an insert (Fig. 4, lane f). Since the NIH3T3 cells grew well in much lower serum than the C2C12 cells, the NIH3T3 transfectants were used for the subsequent studies.Purification of Recombinant Thrombospondin-4When the culture supernatants from cells that are expressing recombinant thrombospondin-4 are applied to a column of heparin-Sepharose, the 140,000- and 120,000-dalton bands are retained by the column (Fig. 5). The majority of the 140,000-dalton band is eluted in the 0.25 M and 0.55 M NaCl peaks. The 120,000-dalton polypeptide is present in all of the fractions. The ratio of the 140,000-dalton polypeptide to the 120,000-dalton polypeptide varies in the different pools. The protein that flows through the heparin-Sepharose column without binding is considerably enriched in the 120,000-dalton polypeptide (Fig. 5, lane b). The amount of the 120,000-dalton polypeptide varies in the different preparations, and less is observed when the protease inhibitors diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride are included.Figure 5Heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography of the culture supernatants from a NIH3T3 cell line that is expressing recombinant thrombospondin-4. The original sample (lane a), the flow-through (lane b), and the proteins that were eluted with buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl (lane c), 0.25 M NaCl (lane d), or 0.55 M NaCl (lane e) were electrophoresed on 3-10% polyacrylamide gradient gels.

The ratio of the bands is again variable, and both bands bind antibody 1259 on Western blots (Fig. 6, lane e). In the absence of reducing agent, the material that is bound by the column electrophoreses as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 550,000 (Fig. 6, lanes b and c).

When human recombinant thrombospondin-4 is digested with TPCK-trypsin at 0°C for 20 h in the presence of calcium, a broad spectrum of proteolytic fragments is produced (Fig. 7). A considerable amount of mass is associated with high molecular mass bands of 115,000, 107,000, 97,000, 71,000, and 64,000 daltons. When the digestion is performed in the absence of calcium, the majority of mass is associated with bands of 56,000 and 42,500 daltons (Fig. 7).Figure 7Limited tryptic digestion of thrombospondin-4. Human platelet thrombospondin-1 (lanes a and b) or recombinant thrombospondin-4 (lanes c and d) was digested in the presence (lanes a and c) or absence (lanes b and d) of calcium with TPCK-trypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100. The bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (lanes a and b) or by Western blotting with antibody 1259 (lanes c and d). The molecular weights are given on the left for the thrombospondin-1 experiment (lanes a and b) and on the right for the thrombospondin-4 experiment (lanes c and d) which were run on different gels.

Like thrombospondin-1, thrombospondin-4 displays a calcium-dependent conformational change as evidenced by an increase in the length of the thin-connecting regions when the molecules are treated with EDTA (Fig. 8b). In the presence of EDTA, the thin-connecting regions of thrombospondin-4 are 28.3 ± 2.9 nm in length and terminate in globular regions that are 8.5 ± 1.2 nm in diameter (all dimensions are given as mean ± S.D. and are not corrected for thickness of replicating metal). In those images in which the thin-connecting regions are splayed out and readily resolvable, five thin-connecting regions and globular terminal domains are observed most frequently (Fig. 8, a and b). However, in the images of some of the molecules, only four thin-connecting regions with globular regions at the end are observed (Fig. 8c). A globular region is also observed in the area where the thin-connecting regions appear to be connected to each other.Figure 8Electron microscopy of purified recombinant thrombospondin-4. Thrombospondin-4 was prepared for electron microscopy in the presence (a) or absence (b and c) of 200 μM CaCl2. Whereas, in some molecules, five thin-connecting regions and the associated globular structures are resolved (a and b), some molecules appear to have only four thin-connecting regions and associated globular domains (c).

A subsequent study identified human thrombospondin-4 and established that this protein is most closely related to thrombospondin-3 and more distantly related to thrombospondin-1 and −2 (Lawler et al., 1993b). Thrombospondin-4 has apparent molecular weights of 140,000 and 550,000 in the presence and absence of reducing agents, respectively. Coomassie Blue-stained gels detect the 140,000- and 120,000-dalton polypeptides as the reduced subunits of the 550,000-dalton protein. Since both of these bands react with the antibody to the COOH-terminal peptide (antibody 1259), the difference in molecular mass is probably due to proteolytic cleavage of a 20,000-dalton fragment from the NH2-terminal of thrombospondin-4.Heparin binding is a common feature of the thrombospondins. Heparin binding consensus sequences are present in the first 90 amino acids of the thrombospondin-1 sequence. Mutagenesis of the basic amino acids in these sequences decreases the molecules ability to bind heparin (Lawler et al., 1992). Human thrombospondin-4 contains a heparin-binding consensus sequence (BBXB, where B is a basic and X is any amino acid) between amino acids 102 and 105. Whereas the data presented here indicate that thrombospondin-4 binds to heparin, we cannot preclude the possibility that a small protein that is tightly bound to thrombospondin-4 provides the heparin-binding activity. Future mutagenesis experiments will help to resolve this issue.Table 1 compares the molecular weight determinations of thrombospondin-4 with those of thrombospondin-1 and COMP. Whereas SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agent does not generally provide an accurate determination, the values that are obtained in this way for thrombospondin-1 and COMP agree well with values obtained by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation (Table 1). This suggests that the molecular weight of intact thrombospondin-4 is approximately 550,000. Upon reduction, a principal band of 140,000 daltons and a variable band at 120,000 daltons are observed. The subunit molecular weights of thrombospondin-1 and COMP as determined by SDS-PAGE are considerably higher than the molecular weights that are predicted from the amino acid sequence, indicating that the proteins electrophorese anomalously (Table 1). These proteins contain small percentages of carbohydrate that may contribute to this effect. In addition, the type 3 repeats contain a very high percentage of aspartic acid and may bind less SDS than other proteins that are used to calibrate the gel. Based on these considerations, the thrombospondin-4 subunit can be estimated to have a molecular weight of approximately 110,000. This value suggests that thrombospondin-4, like COMP, is a pentamer (Fig. 9). This conclusion is consistent with the electron microscopic images and the structural similarity to COMP (Efimov et al., 1994).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Figure 9Schematic model of thrombospondin-4. Each subunit is depicted as having globular regions (open circles) at the ends and type 2 and 3 repeats in the middle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Electron microscopy of recombinant human thrombospondin-4 is consistent with a pentameric structure. In some molecules, only four thin-connecting regions with attached globular domains can be resolved (Fig. 8c). Since we do not see evidence of different size molecular assemblies by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agent, this is most likely due to the folding of one leg underneath the remainder of the molecule or due to partial proteolysis. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small percentage of molecules have fewer than five subunits. The sequence similarity of thrombospondin-4 to thrombospondin-1 and COMP suggests that the globular domains at the ends of the thin-connecting regions are equivalent to the COOH-terminal globular domains that are observed in electron microscopic images of thrombospondin-1 and COMP (Galvin et al., 1985; Lawler et al., 1985; Morgelin et al., 1992). The molecular dimensions and calcium-dependent conformational changes that are observed in this region are consistent with this hypothesis. The length of the thin-connecting region that we have determined for thrombospondin-4 is less than that of thrombospondin-1 and equivalent to that of COMP (Lawler et al., 1985; Morgelin et al., 1992). Like thrombospondin-1 and COMP, the thin-connecting regions display considerable flexibility. INTRODUCTIONThe thrombospondins are a family of extracellular calcium binding proteins (for a review, see Adams and Lawler (1993a) and Bornstein (1992)). Thrombospondin-1 has been shown to modulate cell attachment, spreading, migration, and proliferation of various cell types in vitro. Thrombospondin-1 is expressed in many embryonic and adult tissues. By contrast, thrombospondin-4 appears to be specific to cardiac and skeletal muscle (Lawler et al., 1993a). Thrombospondin-4 was identified as cDNA clones from a Xenopus laevis stage 45 library. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that the thrombospondin-4 mRNA encodes for a peptide of 106,326 daltons. It is distinct from thrombospondin-1 and −2 in that it lacks the procollagen homology region and the type 1 repeats and has an additional type 2 repeat. The amino acid sequences indicate that thrombospondin-3 and −4 have a similar composition of structural motifs (Bornstein et al., 1993; Qabar et al., 1994). Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) ( 1The abbreviations used are: COMPcartilage oligomeric matrix proteinTBSTris-buffered saline (pH 7.6)TPCK-trysinL-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. )is also similar but lacks the NH2-terminal domain of approximately 200 amino acids that is present in all of the thrombospondins that have been sequenced to date (Oldberg et al., 1992).We have recently shown that thrombospondin-4 is present in the human genome (Lawler et al., 1993b). Evolutionary comparison of the thrombospondins by progressive sequence alignment using parsimony-based algorithms indicates that the primordial genes that gave rise to the modern thrombospondin genes diverged over 900 million years ago (Lawler et al., 1993b). Subsequent gene duplications have given rise to the known members of the thrombospondin gene family, thrombospondin-1, −2, −3, and −4, and COMP.The structural and functional properties of thrombospondin-1 have been extensively characterized (for reviews see Adams and Lawler (1993a) and Bornstein(1992)). Thrombospondin-1 is composed of 140,000-dalton polypeptides that migrate with an apparent molecular weight of 185,000 on a discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel system (Lawler and Hynes, 1986). The thrombospondin-1 polypeptides assemble to form a trimeric molecule with a molecular weight of 420,000. Thrombospondin-1 and −2 form homo- and heterotrimers (O'Rourke et al., 1992). COMP is a 100,000-120,000-dalton polypeptide that has been isolated from bovine cartilage (Hedborn et al., 1992). In the absence of reducing agent, the protein migrates with a molecular weight that is consistent with a pentameric structure (Hedborn et al., 1992; Morgelin et al., 1992). This conclusion is consistent with electron microscopic images that reveal a structure with five subunits that are similar in appearance to the thrombospondin-1 subunits but that have some differences in dimensions (Morgelin et al., 1992).In this paper, we report on the cloning, sequencing, and expression of human thrombospondin-4. A full-length cDNA construct has been used to express human thrombospondin-4 in mouse fibroblast and myoblast cell lines. The recombinant protein has a subunit molecular weight of 140,000. Electron microscopy and SDS-PAGE indicate that the thrombospondin-4 peptides assemble to form pentamers. Whereas the structure of thrombospondin-4 is distinct from thrombospondin-1, both molecules bind heparin and calcium."

In vitro, endogenous RAR γ and RXRs bound to these elements as heterodimers (RAR•RXR) but not homodimers (RAR•RAR or RXR•RXR). In cultured keratinocytes, all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and CD367 activated βRARE but not RXRE via endogenous RAR•RXR (ED50 = 2.3, 3.8, and 0.3 nM, respectively) whereas SR11237 showed no significant effect. All-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and SR11237 activated RXRE via overexpressed RXR•RXR (ED50 = 110, 120, and 11 nM, respectively), indicating interconversion between retinoic acid isomers, whereas co-overexpression of RARα or RAR γ suppressed this activation. Unlike 9cRA, CD367 neither induced formation of nor activated RXR•RXR. Overexpression of RAR or RXR mutated in transactivation domain AF-2 suppressed endogenous receptor activity over βRARE. Our data suggest that 1) in keratinocytes, RAR•RXR-mediated pathway dominates over that mediated by RXR•RXR; 2) RAR-selective CD367 and RXR-selective SR11237 can be used to identify these two distinct pathways, respectively; 3) βRARE is mainly regulated by RAR•RXR, in which RAR alone confers ligand inducibility whereas AF-2 of unliganded RXR is required for transactivation by liganded RAR AF-2; 4) lack of RXRE activity in keratinocytes is due to low endogenous levels of RXR•RXR and inhibition by RAR•RXR; and 5) interaction among RXRs is much lower than that between RAR and RXR.

RARs and RXRs are ligand-dependent transcription factors that bind to cis-acting DNA sequences called RAREs, which are composed of directly repeated hexameric half-sites with consensus sequences (5′-PuG(G/T)TCA-3′), within the transcriptional regulatory regions of target genes and thereby regulate the rate of transcription of these genes (for review see (15Leid M.

The transactivation properties and differential expression pattern of these receptors suggest that the pleiotropic effects of retinoids may be in part due to combinatorial dimerization of various RAR and RXR members whose expression is ultimately controlled in a cell type-specific way(50Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, receptor activity may be further regulated by cell-specific levels of natural retinoids such as tRA and 9cRA, which have been shown recently to be interconverted in mammalian cell lines(30Levin A.A.

To date, very little is known about the DNA binding and transactivation properties of these endogenous RAR and RXR proteins in adult human epidermal KCs, although induction of βRARE activity by retinoids was observed in human foreskin KCs (56Vollberg Sr., T. Nervi C. George M.D. Fujimoto W. Krust A. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 667-676PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed epidermal KCs(57Aneskievich B.J. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we took advantage of the special features of two distinct RAREs mentioned above, βRARE (DR5) and RXRE (DR1), to determine how at physiological concentrations RARs and RXRs act to regulate transcription in cultured normal KCs from adult human skin in response to various natural and synthetic retinoids. All-trans retinoic acid was purchased from Sigma. 9-cis retinoic acid was generously provided by P. F. Sorter, J. F. Grippo, and A. A. Levin (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ)(30Levin A.A.

Reporter genes, βRARE-tk-CAT and RXRE-tk-CAT, were constructed by inserting double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides, 5′-tcgactaAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCGCA-3′ (consensus hexameric half-sites shown in bold capital letters, random nucleotides in lower case letters, and cloning sites in italics) containing βRARE (DR5) from hRARβ2 gene promoter (39de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) and 5′-tcgaCTGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGTTCA-3′ containing RXRE(DR1) from the rat CRBPII gene promoter(42Mangelsdorf D.J.

To construct pBS-tk-CAT, a EcoO190I-NdeI fragment (379 base pairs) containing a putative AP-1 binding site (59Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) was removed from plasmid pBS(-) (Stratagene) by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, and the plasmid was recircularized using T4 DNA ligase after the EcoO190I and NdeI sites were filled in with nucleotides by DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment according to Sambrook et al.(60Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pBS-1. Then, the HindIII-EcoRI fragment (1.8 kilobase pairs), which contains a minimal promoter from the herpes simplex virus tk gene linked to the bacterial CAT gene, was isolated from pBLCAT8+ (61Klein-Hitpaß L. Ryffel G.U. Heitlinger E. Cato A.C.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and inserted into pBS-1 between sites HindIII and EcoRI to give pBS-tk-CAT. Reporter gene, βRARE3-tk-CAT, contains three head-to-tail copies of βRARE located upstream of tk-CAT in pBLCAT8+. Expression vectors used for expressing RARα, RAR γ, and RXRα are pSG5-hRARα1, pSG5-hRAR γ1, and pSG5-mRXRα, respectively. Expression vectors for the RAR and RXR dominant negative mutants, which contain limited deletions of the AF-2 domain at the C terminus (Δ(412-462) for RAR and Δ(449-467) for RXR), are pSG5-mRARαdn and pSG5-mRXRαdn(62Durand B. Saunders M. Leroy P. Leid M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 71: 73-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), respectively, and are referred to as dnRAR and dnRXR, respectively, thereafter. Keratome biopsies were obtained from buttock skin of healthy adult human volunteers as described(63Voorhees J.J. Duell E.A. Bass L.J. Powell J.A. Harrell E.R. Arch. Dermatol. 1972; 105: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Blade depth was set as 0.2 mm to cut near the epidermis-dermis junction. Thus, biopsies contained primarily epidermis with residual amounts of dermis. Typically, cells in the epidermal biopsies are composed of 95% KCs and 5% other cell types, which are primarily epidermal melanocytes and Langerhans cells. In addition, biopsies contain a few endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and dendritic cells. Therefore, the data regarding human epidermis in this study predominantly pertain to retinoid receptors in epidermal KCs. Biopsies taken were immediately kept in ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution (Sigma) prior to preparation of nuclear extracts or KC culture. All procedures involved in handling human subjects received prior approval by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board, and each individual provided written consent. Primary cultures of normal human KCs were prepared as described(64Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. Weber M.M. Sekely L.I. In Vitro Models for Cancer Research. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 245-274Google Scholar). Subcultures were expanded in a defined serum-free medium, KGM (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Keratome biopsies were treated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% (w/v) trypsin, 0.1% (w/v) EDTA at 37°C for 30 min, and trypsinization was stopped by adding fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). KCs were released from tissues by scraping. For cultured KCs, cells at stage of the third passage were collected in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline by scraping culture dishes with a rubber policeman. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described(65Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Ferrandon D. Rosales R. Vigneron M. Macchi M. Ruffenach F. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cultured KCs at the stage of the second passage were seeded into φ 100-mm dishes. At 80-90% confluence, 15 dishes of cells were transfected by lipofection with a total of 12.5 μg/dish of expression vector DNA for RAR γ and/or RXRα (at 1:1 ratio in the case with two receptors co-transfected). Cells were fed with fresh KGM 18 h after transfection and harvested 48 h thereafter. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Regular and immunological gel mobility shift assays were performed according to Rochette-Egly et al.(66Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Saunders M. Scheuer I. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with modifications. Double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides, which contain the wild type (wt) or mutated (m) retinoic acid-responsive elements from the hRARβ2 gene promoter (βRARE) and the rCRBPII gene promoter (RXRE), were labeled using [ γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mM, DuPont NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Sequences of these 5′- γ-32P-labeled probes are 5′-tcgactaAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCGCA-3′ for βRAREwt (consensus hexameric half-sites shown in bold capital letters and random nucleotides in small case letters); 5′-tcgactaAGTTTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCGCA-3′ for βRAREm1 (mutations underlined); 5′-tcgactaAGTTTTCACCGAAAGTTGTCTCGCA-3′ for βRAREm2; 5′-tcgaCTGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGTTCA-3′ for RXRwt; and 5′-tcgaCTGTCACAAGTCACAAGTCACAAGTCACAATTCA-3′ for RXREm. Mouse monoclonal antibodies used in immunological gel mobility shift assays were 4RX(19Mader S. Chen J.Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

The enzyme consisted of 1358 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 149,633 Da. In order to compare the structure of the chicken and rat enzymes, limited proteolysis was performed with the purified chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase. When the enzyme was digested with subtilisin, it was not converted from the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase type to the O2-dependent oxidase type, in contrast with the mammalian enzyme. However, the enzyme was cleaved mainly into three fragments in a manner similar to that for the rat enzyme at pH 8.2 (20, 37, and 84 kDa) and retaining a full complement of redox centers. The cleavage sites were identified by determination of amino-terminal sequences of the produced fragments. It was concluded that the 20-kDa fragment was amino-terminal, the 84-kDa fragment carboxyl-terminal, and the 37-kDa fragment an intermediate portion in the enzyme protein. On the other hand, when the enzyme was digested with the same protease at pH 10.5, the sample contained only the 20- and 84-kDa portions and lacked the 37-kDa portion. The resultant sample possessed xanthine dichlorophenol indophenol reductase activity, indicating that the molybdenum center remained intact.

An IP3R is thought to play a role in mobilizing calcium required for activation of T lymphocytes. The IP3R is a tetrameric structure comprised of four ∼300-kDa subunits encoded by a ∼10-kilobase mRNA. In the present study we determined the structure of the human type 1 IP3R expressed in T lymphocytes (Jurkats). The IP3R in human T cells had a predicted molecular mass of 308 kDa and was most similar to the non-neuronal form of the rodent type 1 IP3R. Two putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites were identified, one near the amino terminus and one near the putative channel pore at the carboxyl terminus. During T cell activation the IP3R was tyrosine phosphorylated. A site-specific anti-IP3R antibody was used to localize the carboxyl terminus of the IP3R to the cytoplasm in T cells.

Analysis of this primary structure revealed two consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites, one located adjacent to the putative channel pore and the other near the IP3 binding region. To assess whether these tyrosine phosphorylation sites could potentially play a role in regulating calcium release channel function, tyrosine phosphorylation of the IP3R was examined during T cell activation. After activation of human T cells (Jurkat) by anti-CD3 antibody, the IP3R was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Elucidation of the primary structure of the human type 1 IP3R also provided the sequence necessary to synthesize a peptide to serve as the antigen for site-specific polyclonal antibodies. These site-specific anti-IP3R antibodies were used to localize the carboxyl terminus of the IP3R to the cytoplasm and possibly to the perinuclear region. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Medium was changed every 48 h. To isolate the IP3R cDNA, 1 × 106 recombinants from a human leukemic T cell line cDNA library were screened at high stringency (final wash, 0.2 × SSC, 55°C) as described previously(26Marks A. Tempst P. Hwang K. Taubman M. Inui M. Chadwick C. Fleischer S. Nadal-Ginard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8683-8687Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The λgt11 human leukemic T cell line cDNA library was screened with the following cDNA probes: 1) a 946-bp mouse aortic smooth muscle IP3R cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 817-1763 of the mouse brain type 1 IP3R sequence(27Marks A.R. Tempst P. Chadwick C.C. Riviere L. Fleischer S. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20719-20722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 2) a 497-bp human T cell type 1 IP3R cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 5270-5766 of the mouse brain IP3R sequence( 2A. R. Marks, unpublished data. ); 3) a second ∼500-bp human T cell type 1 IP3R cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 4200-4700 of the mouse brain IP3R sequence; 4) a 600-bp type 1 IP3R cDNA was amplified from human T cell total RNA by polymerase chain reaction to fill a gap between nucleotides 6500 and 7000. Human T cell type 1 IP3R cDNAs used as probes to screen the cDNA library were amplified from total RNA using reverse transcriptase followed by the polymerase chain reaction as described previously(27Marks A.R. Tempst P. Chadwick C.C. Riviere L. Fleischer S. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20719-20722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using primers based on the published mouse brain type 1 IP3R sequence(6Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). After tertiary screening, 26 IP3R cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination methodology(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequence reported in this study was obtained entirely from cDNAs isolated from the λgt11 cDNA library with the exception of the 500 nucleotides between bp 6500 and 7000 that were sequenced from three separate amplified cDNAs. Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat T cells using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described previously(29Marks A.R. Taubman M. Saito A. Dai Y. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RNA samples (20 μg) were size fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Hybridization was at 42°C overnight in 50% formamide, 50 mM sodium phosphate, 5 × Denhardt's solution and calf thymus DNA. The final washing was with 0.2 × SSC, at 55°C for 10 min. The probe used for Northern hybridization was the 5′ 1.3 kilobases of the human T lymphocyte IP3R cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of ∼1 × 109 cpm/μg. Autoradiography was performed with a single intensifying screen at −80°C for 48 h. For both immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry we used a site-specific affinity purified polyclonal anti-IP3R antibody that we had previously shown to be specific for the IP3R both by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry (30Moschella M.C. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This antibody was directed against a synthetic peptide, IP3R2652, based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the human T cell type 1 IP3R amino acid residues 2652-2663 ((Cys)-Glu-Gln-Asn-Glu-Leu-Arg-Asn-Leu-Gln-Glu-Lys-Leu, with an amino-terminal cysteine added for coupling to keyhole lympet hemacyanin prior to immunization in rabbits as described previously(30Moschella M.C. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cell membranes were prepared using a sucrose gradient essentially as described elsewhere(31Peterson R. Biedler J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1978; 9: 289-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty μg of membrane protein was size fractionated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Semidry apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 1 h followed by 25 V for 1 h, both at 4°C as described previously(30Moschella M.C. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Filters were incubated with blocking buffer (80 mM Na2HP04, 20 mM NaH2P04, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% dry milk) for 1 h. Affinity purified rabbit anti-IP3R antibody was added at 1/100 dilution. Filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at a dilution of 1/7500 in blocking buffer. Signals were detected using the ECL detection reagents (Amersham International Inc.) followed by autoradiography. Permeabilized or unpermeabilized Jurkat cells were treated with affinity purified anti-IP3R antibody at 1/50 dilution. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum followed by incubation with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to biotin. Cells were washed and avidin-rhodamine conjugate was added at a 1/1000 dilution, followed by washing and fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. For permeabilization, cells were treated with 100% methanol at room temperature for 5 min, washed, and stained as above. Cells were also stained using a rabbit antiprotein disulfide isomerase antibody (SPA-890, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, BC, Canada) used to stain the endoplasmic reticulum. As a negative control T cells were stained using anti-IP3R antibody that had been preabsorbed with 1 mg/ml antigenic peptide at 37°C for 45 min (Fig. 6f) to demonstrate the specificity of the staining as described previously(30Moschella M.C. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Incubation at 37°C for 45 min without the antigenic peptide did not block the anti-IP3R staining of permeabilized T cells. Affinity purified rabbit anti-IP3R antibody was added to 0.5 × 106 Jurkat cells at a 1/50 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 30 min on ice followed by incubation with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate) for an additional 30 min. Cells were either immediately analyzed using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analyzer (Coulter) or fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and then analyzed within 2 days. Cells were incubated with either phosphate-buffered saline or secondary antibody alone as negative controls. Permeabilization of Jurkat cells was with 100% methanol for 5 min followed by antibody staining as described above. Three thousand cells were analyzed for each sample. Jurkat cells (2.5 × 108) were stimulated by incubating with anti-CD3 (1% culture supernatant, kindly provided by Dr. Asit Panja) at 37°C for 3 min. Control cells were treated under identical conditions except that phosphate-buffered saline was added instead of the anti-CD3 supernatant. Cells were harvested and lysed in 0.5% Brij 96, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1.8 mg/ml iodoacetamide. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C. The antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was used for immunoprecipitation and for Western blotting as described(32Letourneuer F. Klausner R. Science. 1992; 255: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 33June C.H. Fletcher M. Ledbetter J. Samelson L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1591-1598PubMed Google Scholar, 34Strauss D.

A consensus sequence for eukaryotic translational start sites (CCGCCATG) (35Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar) was present before the first in-frame ATG. The open reading frame encoded 2713 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 308 kDa. This value is consistent with the size of the IP3R protein based on immunoblot data (Fig. 3). There is 98% amino acid identity between the human and rat type 1 IP3R sequences. The neuronal specific SII exon (19Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) is excluded from the human T cell type 1 IP3R form, and the alternatively spliced SI exon is retained (Fig. 1). Three consensus sequences for nucleotide-binding sites (G-X-G-X-X-G-(nX)-K, n = 17-21;(36Wierenga R. Hol W. Nature. 1983; 302: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar)) are conserved at amino acid residues 1689-1694, 1737-1742, and 1978-1983 (Fig. 1). Two putative protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (R/K-R/K-X-S/T;(37Huganir R. Miles K. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6968-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)) are conserved at serine residues 1589 and 1717 (Fig. 1). Although the transmembrane topography of the type 1 IP3R has not been fully established experimentally, the preferred model identifies six putative transmembrane segments, designated M1 through M6 (Fig. 1), that may form the channel pore clustered near the carboxyl terminus(38Michikawa T.

The first line is the human sequence, the second line indicates the amino acid residue where there are differences with the rat form. The alternatively spliced exon denoted SI (underlined sequence) is preferentially expressed in the thymus and spleen. The alternatively spliced SII exon (underlined sequence) is excluded from the present form of the IP3R consistent with the non-neuronal splicing pattern. The amino acid sequence of the human type 1 IP3R was deduced from cDNA cloning as described under “Materials and Methods.” Two putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites are denoted by the small asterisks (∗) above residues 482-486 and 2617-2621. The large asterisks (∗) at serine residues 1589 and 1717 denote putative protein kinase A phosphorylation sites. Six putative transmembrane sequences are overlined and labeled M1 through M6. The double underlining identifies consensus sequences for nucleotide-binding sites at amino acid residues 1689-1694, 1737-1742, and 1978-1983. Two stretches of 10 amino acids that are 90% conserved between the IP3R and RyR channels are denoted by under- and overlines: residues 2001-2010, SLTEYCQGPC, with only one mismatch (I for C in the RyR); and residues 1931-1940, ILRFLQLLCE, with only one mismatch (F for L in the RyR). The exclamation marks (!) at amino acid residues 2652-2663 identifies the sequence of the synthetic peptide used to raise site-specific anti-IP3R antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Immunoblot of IP3R in human T lymphocytes and in rat brain. Rat brain homogenate (50 μg of total protein) and crude membrane preparation from Jurkat were size fractionated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and probed with affinity-purified anti-IP3R antibody. A single band migrating at ∼300,000 Da is seen in both human T lymphocytes (Jurkat) and rat brain, a nonspecific lower molecular band is seen in rat brain, but not in human T lymphocytes. Primary antibody was used at a 1:100 dilution. Position of molecular weight markers are indicated: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (prestained, migrates at 80 kDa), and ovalbumin (49.5 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The type 1 IP3R is related to the RyR/calcium release channel from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These two molecules are members of the intracellular calcium release channel family that is distinct from other known ion channel structures. Several regions of significant homology exist between the IP3R and the RyR. Two stretches of 10 amino acids are 90% conserved between the two channels: residues 2001-2010, SLTEYCQGPC, with only one mismatch (I for C in the RyR); and residues 1931-1940, ILRFLQLLCE, with only one mismatch (F for L in the RyR). In both channels these sequences are located in the putative cytoplasmic domains and could serve as binding sites for molecules that regulate both channels. Several such agents exist including calcium and caffeine although the modulatory effects of each agent differs markedly between the two channels. For example, the channels have differential sensitivities to calcium (7Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar) and caffeine activates the RyR but inhibits the IP3R(39Bezprozvanny I. Bezprozvannaya S. Ehrlich B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to these small regions of sequence identity it has been previously observed that there is approximately 40% homology between the IP3R and RyR at the carboxyl-terminal region encoding the putative transmembrane pore forming segments(40Mignery G. Sudhof T. Takei K. Camilli P. Nature. 1989; 342: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Two putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites are present at residues 482 (EDLvY) and 2617 (DsTEY) of the human type 1 IP3R. Interestingly, the site at residue 482 is not conserved in human type 2 and 3 receptors (10Yamamoto-Hino M. Sugiyama T. Hikichi K. Mattel M. Hasegawa K. Sekine S. Sakurada K. Miyakawa A. Furuichi T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. Receptors and Channels. 1994; 2: 9-22PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the site at amino acid 2617 is conserved in the human type 2 but not the type 3 receptor. The putative tyrosine phosphorylation site at amino acid 482 is near the IP3 binding region identified by Mignery and Sudhof(17Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The putative tyrosine phosphorylation site at amino acid 2617 is near the predicted channel pore region. A single ∼10-kb mRNA species was identified by Northern hybridization of Jurkat total RNA using a human T lymphocyte cDNA probe (Fig. 2). IP3R mRNA levels determined by Northern hybridization analyses were constant during T cell activation by anti-CD3 (Fig. 2). Immunoblot analysis was performed using crude homogenates from rat brain and from human T cell (Jurkat) membranes to determine the specificity of the anti-IP3R antibody. The anti-IP3R antibody recognized a single high molecular mass band (∼300 kDa) in these crude homogenates (Fig. 3). The IP3R protein in brain and T cells had similar mobilities. The sequence of the synthetic peptide used as the antigen for the anti-IP3R antibody production is 90% identical to the type 2 and 70% identical to the type 3 IP3R. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the IP3R protein that we detected represents a mixture of types 1, 2, and 3 IP3R. We used the anti-IP3R antibody to determine the cellular localization of the IP3R in human T lymphocytes (Jurkats) using two approaches. First, we analyzed immunostained cells using a FACS. Cells were stained with either preimmune serum or affinity purified anti-IP3R antibody, fixed, and fluorescence intensity was assessed by FACS analysis. Fluorescence signal was observed only on permeabilized cells (Fig. 4), nonpermeabilized cells gave no signal. These results indicated that the IP3R epitope recognized by our anti-IP3R antibody was cytoplasmic. Using a second approach, cells were fixed and stained with the same anti-IP3R antibody and analyzed using confocal microscopy (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence signals were observed only in permeabilized cells (Fig. 5, panels a-f) but not in non-permeabilized cells (not shown) indicating that the epitope recognized by this antibody was intracellular. Clumps of signal appeared to be associated with the plasma membrane. However, these signals were observed only in permeabilized cells, therefore we concluded that they must be recognizing an epitope inside the cell, rather than on the outside of the plasma membrane. In some confocal planes IP3R signal was observed in the perinuclear region (panels c and d). An antiprotein disulfide isomerase antibody was used to stain T cells to localize the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 6, a-d). The localization of the endoplasmic reticulum was similar to that of the IP3R. A preabsorbed anti-IP3R antibody did not stain T cells (Fig. 6, e and f) demonstrating the specificity of this reaction. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the IP3R was examined 3 min after T cell activation by anti-CD3. Jurkat cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. These immunoprecipitates were size fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted using the antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Several proteins were observed to be tyrosine phosphorylated in activated T cells but not in nonactivated cells (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4). Another group of proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated in both nonactivated and in activated T cells but the level of phosphorylation increased following T cell activation (Fig. 7). One of the high molecular weight phosphotyrosine proteins co-migrated with the IP3R as determined by subsequent immunoblotting of the same filter with an anti-IP3R antibody (Fig. 7, lanes 5 and 6). Phosphorylated IP3R was only detected in activated T cells (Fig. 7, lane 6). To demonstrate that this high molecular weight protein was the IP3R, the reverse experiment was performed in which the IP3R was immunoprecipitated from unactivated and activated T cells using the anti-IP3R antibody. This immunoprecipitate was size fractionated and immunoblotted using the antiphosphotyrosine antibody, demonstrating that the IP3R was tyrosine phosphorylated in the activated T cells (Fig. 7, lanes 7 and 8). In the present study we cloned the human type 1 IP3R cDNA from T lymphocytes, demonstrated its cellular localization and its phosphorylation at tyrosine. The human type 1 IP3R is structurally similar to the type 1 receptors from rodent. Based on sequence analysis, the type 1 IP3R expressed in human T lymphocytes corresponds to the non-neuronal form of the type I IP3R. IP3R heterogeneity is created by alternative splicing, and distinct areas of the brain in rats and mice express different IP3Rs(19Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A 15-amino acid sequence near the NH2 terminus and a 40-amino acid sequence located between two putative cytoplasmic phosphorylation sites determine the brain and non-brain forms of the type 1 IP3R (expressed predominately in brain and aortic smooth muscle)(19Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 41Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The human T cell type 1 IP3R form that we have sequenced includes the alternatively spliced SI exon (amino acid residues 318-332), but not the larger 40-amino acid splice, SII, at residue 1698. Interestingly, the SI exon is expressed at highest relative levels in tissues that contain T cells and/or hematopoetic cells, thymus and spleen; whereas the SII exon is expressed almost exclusively in cerebellum(19Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The type 1 IP3R in human T lymphocytes is most likely the intracellular calcium release channel required for T cell activation. As such we would expect it to be constitutively expressed. Indeed we did not observe regulation of IP3R mRNA during mitogenic activation of T lymphocytes (Fig. 2). In human T lymphocytes the type 1 IP3R is expressed predominantly in the periphery of the cytoplasm near the plasma membrane, and possibly in the perinuclear membrane (Fig. 5). The site-specific antibody used in the present study for both FACS analysis and immunolocalization allows us to assign the location of the carboxyl terminus of the IP3R to an intracellular site in T lymphocytes. No signal was seen using FACS or immunocytochemistry in nonpermeabilized cells, whereas permeabilized cells reproducibly gave a strong signal (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Therefore, the epitope recognized by our anti-IP3R antibody must be cytoplasmic. The intense staining apparently at the inner surface of the plasma membrane suggests that the T lymphocyte IP3R might also be localized to plasmalemma caveolae, as has been reported in endothelial cells(22Fujimoto T. Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and/or to endoplasmic reticulum near the plasmalemma. Khan et al.(21Khan A. Steiner J. Klein M. Schneider M. Snyder S. Science. 1992; 257: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) reported that an IP3R was found in the plasma membrane of human T lymphocytes using a polyclonal antibody raised against the entire protein. The present study adds information regarding the topography of the IP3R in the membrane because it places the carboxyl terminus in the cytoplasm. Bourguignon et al.(25Bourguignon L. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a monoclonal anti-IP3R antibody stained permeabilized but not nonpermeabilized mouse T lymphoma cells(25Bourguignon L. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the location of the epitope for the monoclonal antibody was not identified. The finding that our anti-IP3R antibody does not recognize nonpermeabilized cells either by FACS or immunofluorescence staining excludes the possibility that the receptor could be on the plasma membrane facing outward. Moreover, if the IP3R were in the plasma membrane facing outward the IP3 binding site would be extracellular, a localization that is inconsistent with the fact that IP3 is an intracellular second messenger. Thus, two possible transmembrane configurations of the channel are consistent with existing data: 1) the IP3R is on the ER; 2) the IP3R is on the plasma membrane with the bulk of the protein including the IP3 binding site in the cytoplasm. The latter configuration would make the IP3R a calcium influx channel. We believe that this configuration is unlikely because the IP3R is a relatively nonspecific cation channel(42Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). On the ER (which under physiological conditions has no gradient for sodium or potassium across its membrane(43Somlyo A. Shuman H. Somlyo A. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 828-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)), the IP3R functions as a calcium release channel due to the large electrochemical gradient for calcium. If an IP3R does exist on the plasma membrane, as has been proposed(21Khan A. Steiner J. Klein M. Schneider M. Snyder S. Science. 1992; 257: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Fujimoto T. Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 44Kuno N. Gardner P. Nature. 1987; 326: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), it could be another form of IP3R that is more selective for divalent cations than the IP3R on the ER. Our conclusion regarding the subcellular localization of the human type 1 IP3R also agrees with functional data from Mikoshiba and colleagues (45Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakade K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that an antibody which recognizes nearly the same carboxyl-terminal epitope as our antibody was capable of inhibiting IP3-induced intracellular calcium release in Xenopus oocytes. Again, these functional results would place the IP3R on the ER. Of interest, however, is the fact that the epitope for the monoclonal antibody used by Mikoshiba and colleagues (45Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakade K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) to block calcium release also overlaps the putative tyrosine phosphorylation site at amino acid residue 2617. Therefore, the possibility exists that the interference with calcium release was due to inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation. In T cells, activation of the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex results in recruitment of tyrosine kinases that are members of the src family including fyn and lck. It has been proposed that the src family of tyrosine kinases activate a phospholipase C isoform (PLCγ1) which in turn stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis leading to the generation of IP3 and subsequent activation of the IP3R. Our data showing that the IP3R is tyrosine phosphorylated during T cell activation suggest that it might also be possible that the type 1 IP3R in T cells could be a substrate for tyrosine kinases during T cell activation. Of interest, our data also agrees with that of Khan et al.(21Khan A. Steiner J. Klein M. Schneider M. Snyder S. Science. 1992; 257: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) who showed that the IP3R co-caps with the T cell receptor during T cell activation. Co-capping would place the IP3R near the TCR during T cell activation. This association with the TCR would facilitate phosphorylation of the IP3R by tyrosine kinases that are activated during T cell activation. One putative tyrosine phosphorylation site was located near the IP3 binding site. Tyrosine phosphorylation of this site could positively or negatively modulate the affinity of the IP3R for IP3. A decrease in the affinity of the IP3R for the negatively charged IP3 could be induced by the presence of an added negative charge of a phosphate group near the IP3 binding site. Alternatively, tyrosine phosphorylation could increase access to the binding site via a conformational change. A second site is near the putative channel pore region. Phosphorylation at this site could modify channel gating perhaps by inducing a conformational change in the IP3R, or by increasing the affinity of the channel for calcium due to the added negative charge of a phosphate group located near the channel pore. Thus, IP3 and tyrosine phosphorylation could be co-activators of the IP3R. Alternatively, negative regulation of the IP3R by tyrosine phosphorylation could be play a role in shutting off intracellular calcium release via the IP3R after anti-CD3 activation of the T cell receptor. The release of intracellular calcium during T cell activation occurs rapidly during the first few minutes after T cell activation. Activation is mediated by IP3, inactivation could be due to the subsequent phosphorylation of the IP3R. Both the IP3 generation and the tyrosine phosphorylation could be triggered by activation of the TCR. Thus, T cell activation via the TCR could signal both the activation and the inactivation of the IP3R/calcium release channel. Localization of the IP3R to the perinuclear region (Fig. 5) is of potential significance in T cells. Early events during T cell activation are calcium dependent(1Gardner P. Cell. 1989; 59: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). For example, translocation of NF-AT to the nucleus where it triggers interleukin 2 transcription is dependent on the activity of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin which is also a target for the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A(46Liu J. Farmer Jr., J. Lane W. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide signaling has been localized to the nucleus(47Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 48Martelli A. Gilmour R. Bertagnolo V. Neri L. Marzoll L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and the IP3R has been reported to be present in the perinuclear region of Xenopus laevis oocytes(23Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Localization of the IP3R to the perinuclear region in Jurkats suggests that the IP3R could be involved in regulating calcium flux to the nucleus of human T cells. Moreover, cyclic changes in IP3 levels have been linked to cell-cycle changes in calcium transients and inositol polyphosphate levels have recently been shown to vary in a cell-cycle dependent manner(49Ciapa B. Pesando D. Wilding M. Whitaker M. Nature. 1994; 368: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 50Balla T. Sim S.S. Baukal A.J. Rhee S.G. Catt K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for an IP3R-mediated signaling pathway in the regulation of cell cycle progression. The present study establishes that the non-neuronal form of the type 1 IP3R is expressed in human T cells. Moreover, there is now evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of an IP3R in T cells occurs during T cell activation via the TCR. Finally, IP3R protein appears to be expressed in the perinuclear region and most probably in the ER of human T cells. It remains to be determined whether distinct forms of the IP3R are expressed on separate membranes in T cells. We thank Drs. Barbara Ehrlich and James Watras for helpful discussions and for reading this manuscript."

The relationship of gene transactivation by Brn-3a to its ability to transform primary cells which is also dependent on the N-terminal region of the protein is discussed. The POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family of transcription factors are defined on the basis of a common POU domain which constitutes the DNA binding domain of these proteins and which can be subdivided into a POU-specific domain and a POU-homeodomain separated by a short linker region (for reviews, see (1Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)). In contrast to the classical homeodomain proteins, the POU proteins bind to extended DNA sequences related to the consensus octamer motif ATGCAAAT and thereby influence transcription(1Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 2Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

Thus, for example, the Pit-1 factor has been shown to be essential for pituitary gland development in both mice and humans(4Li S. Crenshaw E.B. Rawson E.J. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G.

These sequence differences between the different Brn-3 factors are paralleled by differences in their activity. Thus both Brn-3a and Brn-3c can co-operate with the Ha-ras oncogene to transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). In contrast Brn-3b does not possess this ability and can inhibit the transforming effect of Brn-3a in co-transfection experiments. ( 1T. Theil and T. Möröy, submitted for publication. )The transforming activity of Brn-3a is dependent on the N-terminal region of the protein(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar) 1 which contains a short region known as the POU-IV box that is common to several different POU-IV family members(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar, 14Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 689-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to differences in their transforming ability, the Brn-3 proteins can also have radically different effects on promoter activity. Thus, while the POU domains of all three Brn-3 factors can bind to the octamer motif, a thymidine kinase promoter containing an added synthetic octamer motif is trans-activated by co-transfection with Brn-3a and Brn-3c expression vectors and inhibited by Brn-3b(20Budhram-Mahadeo V. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although, as in the transformation experiments, Brn-3b can inhibit trans-activation by Brn-3a(20Budhram-Mahadeo V. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the ability of Brn-3a to trans-activate the target promoter is not dependent on the N-terminal region of the protein. Rather chimeric molecules containing only the POU domain of Brn-3a linked to the rest of the Brn-3b molecule are able to activate this promoter, whereas a molecule containing the Brn-3b POU domain linked to the remainder of Brn-3a represses it(21Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, the differences in the activity of the Brn-3 factors on this test promoter are determined by the POU domain. These differences in the region of the Brn-3a protein required for transactivation of an artificial test promoter and transformation suggest the possibility that transformation by Brn-3a might not involve transactivation of target genes. Alternatively, the region of Brn-3a required for transactivation may be different depending on the target promoter with some naturally occurring promoters whose protein products are necessary for transformation requiring the N-terminal domain for transactivation rather than the POU domain. To investigate this question, we have identified the gene encoding the neuronal intermediate filament protein α-internexin (22Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. of Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the first neuronally expressed target genes transactivated by Brn-3a and have shown that such transactivation requires the N-terminal region of the protein. The longest α-internexin promoter constructs contained the region of the promoter from 1219 bases upstream of the start site of transcription to 73 bases downstream linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) ( 2The abbreviations used are: CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCREcyclic AMP response element. )gene(22Ching G.Y.

The other constructs contained either 254 or 77 bases of upstream sequence linked to the identical downstream sequence(22Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. of Biol.

The artificial reporter plasmid contains the Brn-3 octamer-related binding site ATGCTAATGAGAT cloned into the BamHI site in the vector pBL CAT 2 which contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter from −105 to +51 driving expression of the CAT gene(23Luckow B.

The Brn-3a, −3b, and −3c expression vectors contain full-length cDNA or genomic clones for each of these proteins (11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T.

In all cases cells were harvested 72 h later. The amount of DNA taken up by the cells in each case was measured by slot blotting the extract and hybridization with a probe derived from the ampicillin resistance gene in the plasmid vector(27Abken H. Reifenrath B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This value was then used to normalize the values obtained in the CAT assay as a control for differences in uptake of plasmid DNA in each sample. Assays of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity were carried out according to the method of Gorman (24Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Vol 2.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214131) Google Scholar). To identify a natural target gene for the Brn-3 factors we tested the promoters of several genes which like the Brn-3 factors (10He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.W.

In each case, the gene promoter driving the gene encoding the marker CAT protein was co-transfected with vectors directing the expression of each of the forms of Brn-3(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out both into BHK-21 fibroblast cells (25Macpherson I. Stoker M. Virology. 1962; 16: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) which lack endogenous Brn-3 as well as into the ND7 cell line derived by the immortalization of primary sensory neurons (26Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Ser. B Biol.

Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In these experiments, no effect of any of the forms of Brn-3 was observed on the promoters of the genes encoding either calcitonin gene related peptide or tyrosine hydroxylase (data not shown) despite the presence of octamer-related motifs in these promoters(29Broad P.M. Symes A.J. Thakker R.V. Craig R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6999-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast the promoter of the gene encoding the neuronal intermediate filament protein α-internexin showed strong activation by both Brn-3a and Brn-3c expression vectors when co-transfected into the BHK cells, whereas the Brn-3b expression vector repressed the basal activity of the α-internexin promoter (Fig. 1). These effects were also observed when the promoter was co-transfected with the various Brn-3 expression vectors into the ND7 cell line which expresses endogenous Brn-3 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Assay of CAT activity in ND7 cells transected with the α-internexin promoter and expression vectors encoding Brn-3a (track 1), Brn-3b (track 2), Brn-3c (track 3), a mixture of the Brn-3a and Brn-3b vectors (track 4) or the empty expression vector alone (track 5).

Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As in our previous experiments(20Budhram-Mahadeo V. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Brn-3b was able to inhibit the stimulatory effect of Brn-3a when the two expression vectors were co-transfected together with the α-internexin promoter (Fig. 2). Hence the natural α-internexin promoter responds to the different forms of Brn-3 in a similar manner to the tK promoter containing added synthetic octamer-related motifs. The α-internexin promoter contains three octamer-related motifs in the region upstream of the transcriptional start site which might act as targets for Brn-3 binding(22Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. of Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, a construct containing 254 bases of upstream sequence which lacks all these motifs still responded to the various forms of Brn-3 in a manner identical to the full length construct (Fig. 3A) while a construct containing only 77 bases of upstream sequence was stimulated more strongly by Brn-3a and Brn-3c and was still repressed by Brn-3b (Fig. 3B). Hence the sequences which mediate the response of the α-internexin promoter to Brn-3 appear to be located within the 77 bases upstream of the transcriptional start site and/or the 73 bases downstream which are present within the shortest construct. In experiments involving more extensive deletions we have been unable to eliminate the responsiveness of the promoter without also eliminating its basal activity suggesting that this responsiveness is a property of the minimal α-internexin promoter. The recent observation that sequences very different from the classical octamer motif can bind Brn-3 very strongly (14Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10841-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1994; 7: 2483-2496Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar) suggests that the minimal α-internexin promoter contains such sequences allowing it to respond to Brn-3. In previous experiments we have shown that treatment of ND7 cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP results in an increase in the level of the Brn-3a mRNA and a decrease in the level of the Brn-3b mRNA(12Lillycrop K.A. Budhram V.S. Lakin N.D. Terremghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This results in a corresponding increase in the activity of a transfected tK promoter linked to a synthetic octamer motif which is not observed for the unmodified tK promoter lacking this added binding site for Brn-3 (20Budhram-Mahadeo V. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the level of the α-internexin mRNA has been shown to be increased following cyclic AMP treatment(22Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. of Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the gene promoter does not contain any cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) which normally mediate the transcriptional response to this compound (32Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore transfected ND7 cells with the constructs containing different amounts of the internexin promoter 5′ upstream sequence and measured their response to treatment with 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP. In these experiments (Fig. 4) all three constructs were stimulated by cyclic AMP with the strongest response being observed for the shortest construct paralleling its strong activation by Brn-3a. These findings together with the absence of a CRE in either the shortest construct or further upstream (22Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. of Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the Brn-3 factors may play a role in the activation of the α-internexin promoter by cyclic AMP paralleling their role in the cyclic AMP inducibility of the tK promoter carrying a synthetic octamer motif(20Budhram-Mahadeo V. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, the α-internexin promoter constructs did not respond to cyclic AMP in BHK-21 fibroblast cells which do not express Brn-3a (data not shown). As discussed above, the effects of cyclic AMP and the different forms of Brn-3 on the α-internexin promoter parallel our findings using an artificial promoter containing a Brn-3 binding site and extend them to a natural promoter. In our previous experiments using this artificial promoter(21Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we used chimeric constructs containing different regions of Brn-3a or Brn-3b (Fig. 5) to show that the ability of Brn-3a to activate this promoter was dependent on its POU domain so that for example construct 1 (AAAB) was not able to activate the promoter, whereas construct 4 (-BBA) was able to do so (21Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). We therefore tested the effect of these chimeric constructs in co-transfections with the full internexin promoter (−1219 to +73). As illustrated in Fig. 6, the effect of these chimeric constructs was completely different to that which we had previously observed. Thus for example construct 1 (AAAB) was now able to activate this promoter as was construct 3 (AABB). In contrast construct 4 (-BBA) did not activate the promoter, although unlike intact Brn-3b it did not repress it. These findings indicate, therefore, that in the case of the α-internexin promoter, the N-terminal region of Brn-3a rather than the POU domain is of critical importance for transactivation. Similar results were also obtained with the shorter α-internexin promoter constructs containing respectively 254 and 77 bases of upstream promoter (data not shown). All the chimeric constructs have previously been shown to produce similar levels of protein in the transfected cells(21Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).1 Having established that within chimeric constructs, the Brn-3a POU domain was necessary for the activation of the octamer-tK promoter but not the α-internexin promoter we wished to investigate whether either of these promoters would be affected by the isolated POU domain alone. The isolated POU domains of Brn-3a and Brn-3b with an added ATG codon to allow translational initiation were therefore cloned under the control of the strong CMV immediate-early promoter in the pJ7 vector (33Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These constructs were then co-transfected with the two promoters. Interestingly, the octamer-tK promoter was clearly transactivated by the isolated Brn-3a POU domain and inhibited by the Brn-3b POU domain (Fig. 7A). In contrast, neither of the constructs was able to activate the α-internexin promoter (Fig. 7B). Indeed both constructs were able to repress this promoter presumably by binding to the promoter and preventing the binding of endogenous Brn-3 proteins. Hence the isolated DNA binding domain of Brn-3a is able to act as a transactivation domain for the octamer-tK promoter explaining the dependence of this promoter on the source of the POU domain when it is co-transfected with different natural and chimeric forms of Brn-3. In contrast this domain is inactive on the α-internexin promoter in agreement with the data indicating that the N-terminal domain of Brn-3a is required for transactivation of this promoter. The Brn-3a transcription factor has been shown to be able to transactivate both artificial promoters containing an appropriate binding site cloned upstream of a test promoter (14Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10841-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or the natural promoters for the genes encoding proopiomelanocortin (14Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10841-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and α-internexin (this report). Here we show, however, that at least two distinct regions of the protein can independently mediate such transactivation depending on the promoter concerned. Thus in the case of the tK promoter with a cloned upstream binding site we have extended our previous findings using chimeric constructs to show that the isolated POU domain of Brn-3a can act both as a DNA binding domain and as a transactivation domain for this promoter. In contrast in the case of the α-internexin promoter, the Brn-3a POU domain is inactive either in isolation or in chimeric constructs and an N-terminal region is required for transactivation. Further studies will be required to determine whether these differences are determined by the sequence of the Brn-3 binding site in each promoter, its context relative to other transcription factor binding sites or its position relative to the transcriptional start site. The presence of two distinct activation domains in Brn-3a is paralleled in the Oct-2 POU transcription factor which contains two distinct activation domains at the N and C termini of the protein(35Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Müller-Immerglück M.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly only the N-terminal activation domain is present in the related Oct-1 factor(37Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), resulting in Oct-1 and Oct-2 having differing abilities in the activation of different octamer-containing genes such as those encoding the immunoglobulins and snRNA molecules (37Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 38Tanaka M. Lai J.-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the case of the Brn-3 factors, Brn-3b unlike Brn-3a is not able to activate either the tK-octamer or the α-internexin promoters due to differences between the two POU factors in respectively the POU domain and the N-terminal region. Interestingly, however, while intact Brn-3b represses the α-internexin promoter, the chimeric -BBA construct did not activate or repress the promoter (Fig. 6). This suggests that whilst the N-terminal region is required for activation by Brn-3a, the POU domain of Brn-3b may be involved in its ability to repress the α-internexin promoter below its basal level. This is likely to involve the recently described ability of Brn-3b to interact with Brn-3a and prevent its binding to DNA1 since such interactions between different POU proteins normally involve heterodimerization via the POU domain(34Verrijzer C.R. van Oosterhout J.A.W.N. van der Vliet P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea, unlike Brn-3b, the -BBA construct was not able to interfere with activation of the internexin promoter when co-transfected with Brn-3a (data not shown). The N-terminal region of Brn-3a which activates transcription contains the POU-IV box, a region of 40 amino acids which is also present in Brn-3c, and the other members of the POU-IV family, I-POU, tI-POU, and Unc-86(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar, 14Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10841-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly only a fragment of this POU-IV box is present in the form of Brn-3b we have used here which is derived from the major transcript in the spinal cord(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). Hence the POU-IV box may be of direct relevance to the ability of Brn-3a to activate transcription. Interestingly however, a transcript encoding a longer form of Brn-3b with additional N-terminal sequences including a complete POU-IV box has been detected in the retina (15Ziang M. Zhou L. Peng Y.W. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Nathans J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 689-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and the CNS (16Turner E.E. Jenne K.J. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 205-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), although it was absent in the spinal cord(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). This longer form of Brn-3b (also known as Brn-3.2:-) (16Turner E.E. Jenne K.J. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 205-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) has been shown to activate a promoter containing a synthetic Brn-3 binding site upstream of the prolactin promoter(16Turner E.E. Jenne K.J. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 205-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hence two distinct forms of Brn-3b may exist which differ in their ability to activate promoters which require the N-terminal region for transactivation. However, neither form would be likely to activate promoters which rely on transactivation by the Brn-3a POU domain since the POU domain common to both forms of Brn-3b is inactive in this assay. Interestingly the N-terminal region of the POU-IV box is similar to a domain found in the N terminus of all c-myc family members (14Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10841-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) which has been shown to modulate their transforming ability(39Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested (11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar) that the POU-IV box may be involved in the ability of Brn-3a to co-operate with the Ha-ras protein in transforming primary cells in the same manner as the c-myc proteins. Whatever the precise role of this box, it is clear that the N-terminal region of Brn-3a is involved both in transactivation of some promoters (this report) and transformation(11Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zörnig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar).1 Hence the transforming ability of Brn-3a is likely to be dependent on the ability of its N-terminal region to activate specific target genes whose protein products are required for transformation. Although the activation of the gene encoding the neuronal intermediate filament protein α-internexin is unlikely to be relevant to transformation of fibroblasts by Brn-3a, this gene may well represent a physiologically relevant target for Brn-3a within the nervous system. Thus the only previously described natural promoter to be activated by Brn-3a is derived from the gene encoding proopiomelanocortin which is expressed in the pituitary gland where levels of Brn-3a are so low as to be undetectable by in situ hybridization(14Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10841-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast α-internexin is widely expressed in the developing and adult nervous system (19Kaplan M.P. Chin S.S.M. Fliegner K.H. Liem R.K.H. J.

In summary, therefore, we have identified the α-internexin promoter as a target for transactivation by Brn-3a and have shown that this effect requires an N-terminal transactivation domain unlike other promoters which are dependent upon the POU domain for transactivation by Brn-3a. Further studies will be required to characterize the physiological role of the Brn-3 factors in the regulation of α-internexin expression as well as to characterize the promoters whose activation via the N-terminal domain is involved in transformation by Brn-3a."
https://openalex.org/W2064325489,"Two multifunctional receptors, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and gp330, have been implicated in the cellular uptake and degradation of a wide spectrum of functionally diverse ligands including plasma lipoproteins, proteases, and proteinase-inhibitor complexes. The two receptors show distinct tissue-specific expression patterns, suggesting different physiological functions. We have examined the cellular degradation of two serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin)-protease complexes, α1-antitrypsin-neutrophil elastase (α1AT • NEL) and α1-antichymotrypsin-cathepsin G (α1ACT • CathG) by normal murine fibroblasts (MEF) expressing LRP, and by a mutant fibroblast cell line (PEA13) which is genetically deficient for LRP. α1AT • NEL complexes bound to LRP on ligand blots and were degraded efficiently by the MEF cells, but not by PEA13 cells. Degradation of the complexes was also significantly reduced by antibodies directed against LRP, further suggesting that fibroblasts require LRP for the cellular uptake and degradation of α1AT • NEL complexes. In contrast to α1AT • NEL, MEF cells did not degrade α1ACT • CathG complexes. However, these complexes were rapidly degraded by the rat embryonal carcinoma cell line L2p58 which abundantly expresses gp330, raising the possibility that the α1ACT • CathG complex might be recognized by gp330. Both complexes were efficiently metabolized by the hepatoma cell line HepG2, presumably involving the serpin-enzyme complex receptor. The differential recognition of serpin-protease complexes by fibroblasts and hepatoma cells, however, indicates that LRP, gp330, and the serpin-enzyme complex receptor are distinct proteins.

The spectrum of ligands that bind to LRP and gp330 is very similar(4Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although binding of α2M∗ and PEA to gp330 has so far not been reported. LRP and gp330 both belong to the LDL receptor gene family which also includes a recently described very low density lipoprotein receptor(15Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and the LDL receptor itself(16Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). The activity of LRP and gp330 has been proposed to be modulated in vivo by a receptor-associated protein (RAP) of approximately 39 kDa which blocks the binding of all known ligands to either receptor (4Willnow T.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distinct tissue-specific expression patterns of the two receptors suggest different physiological functions. Whereas gp330 is highly expressed in the glomerular and proximal tubular epithelia of the kidney (20Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 667-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and in the type II pneumocytes of the lung(21Kotas R.V. Kanalas J.J. Tio F.O. Makker S.P. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 1991; 10: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), LRP is predominantly expressed in the hepatocytes, the neurons of the brain, fibroblasts, and macrophages(22Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B.S. VandenBerg S.R. Gonias S.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 37-42PubMed Google Scholar, 23Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the LRP gene in mice prevents development of homozygous defective embryos beyond day 13.5 post coitum(24Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 25Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Complete loss of all functions associated with LRP is obviously incompatible with survival beyond the embryonic stage, but loss or impairment of individual functions of LRP concerning a specific ligand might cause more limited damage in organs or tissues most dependent on this specific function. Identification of differential and/or tissue-specific recognition of a ligand by the two receptors LRP and gp330 might thus allow conclusions relating to their specific functions in vivo. The high expression of gp330 in type II pneumocytes (21Kotas R.V. Kanalas J.J. Tio F.O. Makker S.P. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 1991; 10: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) suggests a specific role for this receptor in the lung and especially in the alveolar space. In contrast, in the lung LRP is preferentially expressed in the alveolar macrophages(23Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because LRP and gp330 are expressed by defined cell populations within the lung, we have examined their possible role in the removal of complexes of the two closely related serpins α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) and α1-antichymotrypsin (α1ACT), both of which are expressed by lung alveolar macrophages and detectable in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in variable concentrations(26Burnett D.

Invest. 1986; 77: 1952-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). α1AT and α1ACT are 42% homologous to each other on the amino acid level(28Chandra T. Stockhouse R. Kidd V.J. Robson K.J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both are encoded by genes which lie in close proximity to each other on chromosome 14q32.1(30Billingsley G.D. Walter M.A. Hammond G.L. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 343-353PubMed Google Scholar). α1AT is known to protect lung structures against proteolytic damage by neutrophil elastase (NEL), which is specifically complexed and inactivated by α1AT(31Travis J. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Severe genetic α1AT deficiency is associated with a 20-30-fold increased risk for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due to insufficient inhibition of elastolytic activity(32Cox D.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 2409-2435Google Scholar, 33Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recently, defective mutants of α1ACT have also been described in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(34Poller W. Faber J.-P. Weidinger S. Tief K. Scholz S. Fischer M. Olek K.

Both inhibitors, α1AT and α1ACT, are apparently taken up and degraded together with the complexed proteases via a distinct SEC receptor which has been described in hepatoma cells and monocytes(36Perlmutter D.H.

In the present study we have investigated possible roles of LRP and gp330 for the binding and cellular uptake of α1AT•NEL and α1ACT•CathG complexes by exploring the recognition of these ligands by cell types expressing gp330, LRP, or neither receptor, as well as by HepG2 cells which contain the SEC receptor. Wild type (MEF) and LRP-deficient (PEA13) murine embryonic fibroblasts were isolated as described earlier(38Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The L2p58 rat yolk sac carcinoma cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Marilyn Farquhar, UCSD, La Jolla. Human α2-macroglobulin activated with methylamine (α2M∗) was a gift from Dudley Strickland (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase or a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and rat RAP were produced in DH5α bacteria as described(17Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human NEL, human leukocyte cathepsin G (CathG), human α1AT, and human α1ACT were purchased from Sigma. Human plasma LDL was isolated and iodinated as described (39Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). All other 125I-labeled ligands were radiolabeled by the IODO-GEN method(40Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). 10 μg of lyophilized NEL or CathG were dissolved in 100 μl of H2O and iodinated at 4°C according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction was terminated by addition of sodium tyrosine to a final concentration of 0.25 mM and incubation for 2 min at 4°C. Protease-inhibitor complexes were formed by addition of the protease inhibitor at a 3-5-fold molar excess and incubation at 22°C for 30 min. After addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 2 mM, the complexes were separated from unincorporated 125I on a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Complexes were stored at 4°C for up to 48 h. Partially purified membrane preparations from rat liver and kidney as well as from the various cell lines were prepared as described earlier (41Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by 3-10 or 4-15% SDS-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions at 30 mA for 4 h at 4°C. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters at 4°C and processed for ligand blotting as follows: nitrocellulose strips were incubated in blotting buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 80 mM NaCl, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 8) for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was replaced with blotting buffer containing the indicated iodinated ligands. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, strips were washed 3 × for 10 min in blotting buffer without bovine serum albumin and exposed to DuPont Cronex film. The specific activities of the iodinated ligands were: 125I-GST-RAP, 1000-1200 cpm/ng; 125I-α2-macroglobulin, 350-1600 cpm/ng; 125I-LDL, 250 cpm/ng; α1AT/125I-NEL, 3744-7100 cpm/ng; α1ACT/125I-CathG, 6300-8200 cpm/ng. Western blots were performed using the ECL system (Amersham) according to manufacturer's recommendations. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 12-well plates and grown for 24 h prior to the addition of 125I-labeled ligands. For determination of LDL degradation, cells were grown for 48 h in medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient newborn calf serum prior to the degradation assay to induce expression of the LDL receptor. The medium was then replaced by DMEM (without glutamine) containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and the indicated iodinated ligands. Cellular degradation of 125I-labeled proteins was measured as described previously (39Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) and is expressed as nanograms of 125I-labeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble (non-iodide) material released into the culture medium per mg of total cell protein. Protein content of cell lysates was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Complexes of 125I-labeled NEL and CathG with α1AT or α1ACT, respectively, were formed in vitro immediately following the radioiodination of the proteases as described under “Materials and Methods” and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). In both cases the majority of the 125I-labeled proteases (lanes 1 and 3) was converted to an SDS-stable complex of higher molecular weight (lanes 2 and 4) as is typical for complexes of serpins with their target proteases. Preparations of rat liver (L) or rat kidney (K) membrane proteins were separated by electrophoresis on nonreducing 3-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with the labeled complexes or with 125I-labeled GST-RAP fusion protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) to demonstrate the presence of LRP and gp330 in the respective membrane preparations. α1AT•125I-NEL complex bound only to LRP (lane 3) but not to gp330 (lane 4) on ligand blots. α1ACT•125I-CathG complexes did not bind to either protein on ligand blots (not shown). The in vitro binding properties of the α1AT•125I-NEL complex to LRP in partially purified liver membrane fractions were similar to those of other previously characterized LRP ligands (Fig. 2B), inasmuch as binding was dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ and could be abolished by coincubation with EDTA (lane 2) or GST-RAP fusion protein (lane 4).Figure 2Binding of α1-antitrypsin-125I-elastase to rat liver membranes. 700 μg of partially purified membrane proteins from rat liver and rat kidney were subjected to preparative nonreducing 3-10% SDS-gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The position of migration of LRP and gp330 (arrow), myosin (200 kDa), and phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa) in the gel is indicated. A, replicate nitrocellulose strips (approximately 50 μg of protein/strip) of liver (L) and kidney (K) membrane preparations were subjected to ligand blot analysis as described under “Materials and Methods” using 1 × 106 cpm/ml of 125I-labeled GST-RAP (lanes 1 and 2) or 1 × 106 cpm/ml α1AT•125I-NEL complex (lanes 3 and 4). Blots were exposed to DuPont Cronex film for 24 h at −70°C. B, replicate nitrocellulose strips (approximately 50 μg of protein/strip) of liver membrane proteins were preincubated at 22°C for 30 min with either blotting buffer (lane 1) or blotting buffer containing 20 mM EDTA (lane 2), 30 μg/ml GST (lane 3), or 30 μg/ml GST-RAP (lane 4). Each strip was then incubated for 1 h with α1AT•125I-NEL complex (1 × 106 cpm/ml), after which the strips were exposed to DuPont Cronex film for 24 h at −70°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cellular degradation experiments performed in cultured fibroblasts (Fig. 3) that either express LRP abundantly (MEF, open circles) or are genetically deficient for this receptor (PEA13, closed circles) confirmed the results obtained from the ligand blot experiments. α1ACT•125I-CathG complexes that did not bind to LRP on ligand blots were not degraded by either cell line (Fig. 3A). In contrast, α1AT•125I-NEL complexes which bound specifically to immobilized LRP were efficiently degraded by the LRP expressing MEF cells, but not by the PEA13 cells lacking LRP (Fig. 3B). As shown previously, PEA13 cells completely lack the ability to endocytose the LRP ligand α2-macroglobulin (Fig. 3C) due to absence of the receptor(38Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while they take up and degrade LDL normally (Fig. 3D). LDL does not bind to LRP, but to the related LDL receptor. Primary LRP-deficient fibroblasts isolated from 10.5 day mouse embryos homozygous for the LRP gene defect did also not degrade α1AT•125I-NEL complexes, indicating that the inability of PEA13 cells to degrade this ligand resulted from the LRP gene defect and not from an unrelated clonal aberration (data not shown). In contrast to the in vitro binding of α1AT•125I-NEL complexes to LRP which was blocked by coincubation with GST-RAP fusion protein, degradation of α1AT•125I-NEL by MEF cells (Fig. 4, lane 5) was reproducibly unaffected by the presence of GST-RAP in the culture medium (lane 6), while the degradation of 125I-α2M∗ (lane 1) was completely blocked by GST-RAP (lane 2). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against LRP (lane 3), but not preimmune IgG (lane 4), also substantially reduced the cellular degradation of 125I-α2M∗ as well as of α1AT•125I-NEL (lane 8), further indicating that LRP mediates the degradation of both these ligands. Degradation of α1AT•125I-NEL (lane 7) and 125I-α2M∗ (not shown) was largely inhibited by chloroquine, indicating that lysosomal processes are involved. We next explored the ability of four different cell lines, MEF, PEA13, HepG2, and the rat yolk sac carcinoma cell line L2p58, to degrade α1ACT•125I-CathG complexes. HepG2 cells have been reported to express a not yet completely characterized SEC receptor (36Perlmutter D.H. Joslin G. Nelson P. Schasteen C. Adams S.P. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and L2p58 cells have been found to express gp330 abundantly(42Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4082-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, α1ACT•125I-CathG complexes were not degraded by either MEF or PEA13 cells, however, they were efficiently metabolized by HepG2 cells and L2p58 cells. In contrast, 125I-α2M∗ was degraded much more efficiently by MEF and by L2p58 than by HepG2 cells, indicating the presence of SEC receptors in HepG2 and L2p58 cells which are unrelated to LRP (Fig. 5B). Similar to the degradation of α1AT•125I-NEL complexes by murine fibroblasts (Fig. 4), GST-RAP also had no effect on the degradation of α1ACT•125I-CathG complexes by L2p58 cells (Fig. 6, lane 5), while it effectively blocked 125I-α2M∗ degradation (lane 2). As in MEF cells, degradation of these ligands by L2p58 cells was chloroquine sensitive (lanes 3 and 6). L2p58 cells had been reported to abundantly express gp330. In an attempt to correlate the expression levels of LRP and gp330 in MEF cells and in L2p58 cells, respectively, we performed a semiquantitative Western blot analysis (Fig. 7). Crude membrane proteins from MEF (lanes 1 and 3) or L2p58 cells (lanes 2 and 4) were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. LRP (lanes 1 and 2) and gp330 (lanes 3 and 4) were then detected by incubation of the filters with specific polyclonal antibodies. While MEF cells express LRP abundantly (lane 1) L2p58 cells express only low amounts of this protein (lane 2). In contrast, murine fibroblasts are completely devoid of gp330 (lane 3), whereas L2p58 cells contain this protein (lane 4). We have studied the role of LRP in the cellular uptake and degradation of two homologous serpins, α1AT and α1ACT, complexed to their respective target proteases, NEL and CathG. We find that α1AT•NEL, but not α1ACT•CathG complexes, bind to LRP on ligand blots. Likewise, α1AT•125I-NEL, but not α1ACT•125I-CathG complexes, are efficiently internalized and degraded by fibroblasts expressing LRP. This degradation is reduced by polyclonal antibodies directed against LRP. Furthermore, murine embryonic fibroblasts genetically deficient for LRP did not degrade α1AT•NEL complexes indicating that this ligand is indeed endocytosed and degraded by normal murine fibroblasts in an LRP-dependent manner. HepG2 cells, in contrast, which have previously been reported to express a SEC receptor readily metabolized α1ACT•CathG (Fig. 5) and α1AT•NEL complexes (not shown) in agreement with earlier publications(36Perlmutter D.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both complexes were also taken up and degraded by L2p58 cells (Fig. 5 and data not shown) which besides LRP also express gp330 (Fig. 7). In contrast to other ligands recognized by LRP or gp330, degradation of neither α1AT•NEL nor of α1ACT•CathG complexes was affected by GST-RAP(4Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, binding of α1AT•NEL complexes to LRP on ligand blots was effectively blocked by RAP. Although the reasons for this difference are not entirely clear, it is possible that the α1AT•NEL binding site of LRP immobilized on nitrocellulose filters may not be in its native conformation making it more sensitive to competition by RAP. Our data support the existence of a SEC receptor on HepG2 cells which is unrelated to LRP, because HepG2 cells, but not fibroblasts, efficiently degrade α1ACT•CathG complexes. Although both cell types express LRP, as shown by their ability to degrade 125I-α2M∗, fibroblasts do so more effectively. This is a further indication for a physical distinction between the SEC receptor and LRP. An involvement of gp330 in the metabolism of α1ACT•CathG complexes is possible, but not proven at the present time. Clearly, the SEC receptor in liver-derived cells is different from gp330 which is not expressed in the liver(4Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the uptake and degradation of α1ACT•CathG complexes by L2p58 cells could involve gp330. α1AT and α1ACT both belong to the serpin class of protease inhibitors which includes about 20 different proteins including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The latter binds to both LRP and gp330 (4Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LRP can also bind α1AT•NEL complexes (this study). It is tempting to speculate that, for as yet unknown reasons, LRP and gp330 display a selective, but partially overlapping, ligand binding spectrum where some serpins might bind to one, but not to the other or to either receptor. There is growing evidence that proteinase-antiproteinase complexes directly or indirectly initiate cellular signal transduction events. For example, α1AT-proteinase complexes mediate an increase of α1AT gene expression in human monocytes and macrophages (44Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsal P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and are also a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils (45Banda M.J. Rice A.G. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, α1ACT•CathG complexes stimulate the synthesis of acute phase proteins via interleukin-6(46Kurdowska A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21023-21026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, receptor binding-competent α2M∗ has been shown to elevate intracellular second messengers in murine peritoneal macrophages (47Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and α2M∗ has been reported to substantially increase the transforming growth factor-β1 mediated proliferative response in smooth muscle cells(48Stouffer G.A. LaMarre J. Gonias S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18340-18344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is no evidence that these signal transduction events are directly mediated by LRP, although such a possibility has been discussed for the SEC receptor. However, internalization and lysosomal degradation of these complexes by LRP and/or by another endocytic receptor (e.g. possibly gp330) could be an important regulatory mechanism which turns off the signal evoked by the binding of these complexes to another unrelated signaling receptor on the cell surface. In summary, our data provide evidence for: 1) a role of LRP in the cellular metabolism of α1AT•NEL complexes, and 2) for differences in the mechanisms by which α1AT•NEL and α1ACT•CathG complexes are taken up and degraded by cells. α1AT•NEL, but not α1ACT•CathG complexes are bound and internalized by LRP which therefore appears to be distinct from the SEC receptor expressed on HepG2 cells. The availability of genetically defined cell lines which express or are devoid of LRP protein will continue to be valuable for future studies aiming at the analysis of receptor-ligand interactions of the two structurally and functionally closely related multifunctional receptors LRP and gp330.

In natural systems, the amino group at the 5 position of neuraminic acid residues is usually assumed to be acylated. Previously, synthetic de-N-acetyl-gangliosides (with free amino groups at the 5 position of neuraminic acids) have been shown to modulate cellular proliferation and tyrosine phosphokinase reactions. While indirect evidence has suggested that traces of these molecules exist naturally in certain tumor cells, further exploration has been hampered by the lack of a system showing consistent expression at an easily detectable level. Using synthetic compounds as antigens, we have developed highly specific monoclonal antibodies against de-N-acetyl-GM3 and de-N-acetyl-GD3 that require both the free amino group and the exocyclic side chain of sialic acids for recognition. Cultured human melanoma cells showed low but variably detectable levels of reactivity with these antibodies. The ability of various biologically active molecules to stimulate this reactivity was explored. Of many compounds tested, only the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein induced reactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Antibody reactivity with ganglioside extracts from genistein-treated cells was abolished by chemical re-N-acetylation and/or truncation of sialic acid side chains by mild periodate oxidation. High performance thin layer chromatography immuno-overlay analysis confirmed the presence of the novel compound de-N-acetyl-GD3 in these extracts. Several other tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested did not give the same increase in de-N-acetyl-ganglioside expression. However, the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole caused a similar accumulation of these molecules, particularly in non-adherent cells expected to be arrested at metaphase. Thus, genistein may induce de-N-acetyl-ganglioside expression by virtue of its known ability to arrest cells in the G2M phase, rather than as a general consequence of tyrosine kinase inhibition. These studies also provide a system in which to analyze the enzymatic basis of de-N-acetyl-ganglioside expression and their potential roles as growth regulating molecules."

This early biochemical signal leads to a series of changes that includes elevation of intracellular calcium, activation of the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase C, and production of lymphokines such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4. Ultimately, these modifications allow T-cell mitogenesis and clonal expansion. The antigen receptor, as well as the associated CD3 and Ζ chains do not possess intrinsic catalytic properties capable of inducing tyrosine protein phosphorylation. However, the CD3 and Ζ subunits have the ability to promote interactions between cytoplasmic tyrosine protein kinases and tyrosine phosphorylation substrates, thereby inducing the TCR signaling cascade. T-cell receptor sheep anti-mouse rabbit anti-mouse interleukin Src homology 2 monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Accumulating data indicate that antigen receptor-triggered tyrosine protein phosphorylation is initiated by p56lck and p59fynT, two Src-related tyrosine protein kinases abundantly expressed in T-cells (reviewed in Samelson and Klausner, 1992; Veillette and Davidson, 1992; Perlmutter et al., 1993; Weiss and Littman, 1994). Upon TCR stimulation, Lck and FynT are postulated to cause phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues located within the tyrosine-based activation motifs of CD3 and Ζ. This phosphorylation presumably creates docking sites for the recruitment of molecules involved in signal amplification. Recently, significant attention has been directed toward a 70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein undergoing association with TCR in activated T-cells (Chan et al., 1991; Wange et al., 1992). Through protein purification and cDNA cloning, this polypeptide (termed Zap-70) was shown to be a novel member of the Syk family of tyrosine protein kinases, exclusively expressed in T-cells and natural killer cells (Chan et al., 1992). Like Syk, Zap-70 possesses two amino-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, as well as a carboxyl-terminal catalytic region. Reconstitution experiments in Cos-7 cells have indicated that the association of Zap-70 with TCR requires signals provided by Lck or FynT (Chan et al., 1992). This idea is also supported by the finding that TCR stimulation on Jurkat T-cells failed to provoke association of Zap-70 with TCR in the absence of p56lck expression (Iwashima et al., 1994). Seemingly, the Src-related enzymes have the ability to trigger binding of the SH2 domains of Zap-70 to TCR by phosphorylating CD3 and Ζ (Wange et al., 1993; Iwashima et al., 1994; Timson-Gauen et al., 1994). Finally, as kinase-defective variants of Zap-70 are still efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated in the Cos-7 system, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap-70 is thought not to be the result of autophosphorylation. Instead, it is presumed to be mediated by Src family kinases (Iwashima et al., 1994). The importance of Zap-70 in normal T-cell physiology has been demonstrated by two lines of experimental evidence. First, Kolanus et al.(1993) reported that antibody-mediated aggregation of chimeric molecules bearing the sequence of Zap-70 linked to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of unrelated molecules is sufficient to cause an elevation of cytoplasmic calcium in T-cells. Hence, Zap-70-mediated signals are likely involved in the regulation of cytosolic calcium during T-cell activation. Second, several groups have demonstrated that the zap-70 gene is mutated in humans with selective T-cell immunodeficiency (Arpaia et al., 1994; Elder et al., 1994; Chan et al., 1994). As Zap-70-deficient individuals exhibit marked alterations in both T-cell differentiation and mature T-cell functions (Arpaia et al., 1994), this observation provides the clearest indication of the central role played by Zap-70 in TCR signaling. In this report, we have examined the regulation of Zap-70 in an antigen-specific T-cell line. By studying various BI-141 derivatives, we found that expression of activated forms of p56lck or p59fynT or co-aggregation of TCR with CD4 caused an increase in the rapidity and extent of Zap-70 tyrosine phosphorylation during T-cell activation. The activated Src-related enzymes also facilitated the association of Zap-70 with the TCR complex, a likely consequence of their ability to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 and Ζ. Evidence was also obtained that two distinct pools of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 molecules existed in activated T-cells. While one pool was stably associated with TCR, the other was complexed with a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (p120) of yet unknown identity. In addition to supporting models of Zap-70 regulation based on studies in heterologous systems, these data indicated that the regulation of Zap-70 is more complex than initially suspected. Furthermore, they raised the possibility that p120 may be an effector and/or a regulator of Zap-70 during T-lymphocyte activation. BI-141 is a CD4-negative, CD8-negative mouse T-cell hybridoma specific for the antigen beef insulin (Reske-Kunz and Rüde, 1985). BI-141 derivatives expressing the neomycin phosphotransferase alone or in combination with tyrosine 505 to phenylalanine 505 (F505) Lck, tyrosine 528 to phenylalanine 528 (F528) FynT, or mouse CD4 were previously reported (Abraham et al., 1991; Caron et al., 1992; Davidson et al., 1992). T-cells were activated by stimulation with anti-TCR Vβ8 mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) F23.1 (Staerz et al., 1985) followed by sheep anti-mouse (SAM) IgG, as outlined elsewhere (Abraham et al., 1991; Davidson et al., 1992). To ligate CD4, cells were incubated with anti-CD4 rat MAb GK1.5 (Wilde et al., 1983) and rabbit anti-rat IgG. Finally, for co-aggregation of TCR and CD4, cells were treated with MAb F23.1-MAb GK1.5 heteroconjugates (kindly given by Dr. Trevor Owens, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montréal, Québec, Canada), followed by SAM IgG. Following activation, cells were lysed by adding an equal volume of 2 × TNE buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mM EDTA), supplemented with 20 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, N-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (100 mM) and sodium orthovanadate (2 mM).

Immune complexes were collected with Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Pansorbin, Calbiochem) coupled, if indicated, to the appropriate second step antibody (either rabbit anti-mouse (RAM) IgG or rabbit anti-hamster IgG). After being recovered by centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were washed several times in lysis buffer, eluted in sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). To immunoprecipitate the TCR complex, cells were stimulated with MAb F23.1 and RAM IgG. After lysis, immune complexes were collected by the addition of S. aureus protein A (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). Control cells were treated in a similar manner, except that lysis was performed prior to the addition of RAM IgG. For these samples, TCR immunoprecipitation was achieved after supplementing the cell lysates with RAM IgG. In some cases, the TCR-depleted lysates were also subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation, using standard protocols. When specified, cells were lysed in boiling 2 × TNE buffer supplemented with 1% SDS to disrupt non-covalent complexes. After shearing the DNA and removing particulate matters by centrifugation, lysates were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS, using 1 × TNE buffer supplemented with the protease and phosphatase inhibitors outlined above. Subsequent immunoprecipitations were conducted as usual. Immunoblots were performed according to a previously described protocol (Veillette et al., 1988a). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots were done using affinity-purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.2 The antiserum directed against the linker region of Zap-70 was used for immunoblotting of Zap-70. After incubation of the Immobilon membranes (Millipore) with 125I-protein A (Amersham Corp.), immunoreactive products were detected by autoradiography and quantitated with a phosphorImager (BAS 2000, Fuji). In the past, the regulation of Zap-70 was primarily examined in non-lymphoid cell systems such as Cos-7 cells and HeLa cells (Chan et al., 1992; Straus and Weiss, 1993, Wange et al., 1993; Iwashima et al., 1994; Timson-Gauen et al., 1994). Thus, to further our comprehension of the interactions between Zap-70 and Src family kinases and to identify potential interactions with other T-cell proteins, we have evaluated the regulation of Zap-70 in the antigen-specific mouse T-cell line BI-141. Previously described derivatives expressing the neomycin phosphotransferase alone or in combination with an activated version of either p56lck (tyrosine 505 to phenylalanine 505 (F505) Lck mutant) or p59fynT (tyrosine 528 to phenylalanine 528 (F528) FynT mutant) were utilized in these studies. Consistent with the proposed roles of Lck and FynT in TCR signaling, BI-141 cells containing activated forms of these Src-like enzymes have been shown to exhibit enhanced TCR-induced tyrosine protein phosphorylation (Abraham et al., 1991; Davidson et al., 1992) (Fig. 1B) and antigen-triggered lymphokine secretion (Abraham et al., 1991; Davidson et al., 1992). We first tested the impact of F505 Lck and F528 FynT on the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap-70. After incubation with anti-TCR MAb F23.1, BI-141 cells were activated for variable lengths of time by the addition of SAM IgG. After lysis in non-ionic detergent-containing buffer, Zap-70 was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit serum against its linker region. Zap-70 tyrosine phosphorylation was then ascertained by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 1A, toppanel). This experiment showed that cells bearing activated p56lck (lanes7-12) exhibited a marked increase in TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap-70 when compared with cells expressing the neomycin phosphotransferase alone (Neo, lanes1-6). Cells containing activated p59fynT (lanes 13-18) also demonstrated an enhanced Zap-70 tyrosine phosphorylation response, albeit to a lesser extent than cells expressing F505 Lck. In all cell lines tested, no significant amount of phosphotyrosine was noted in Zap-70 in the absence of TCR stimulation (lanes1, 7, and 13). Furthermore, the induction of Zap-70 tyrosine phosphorylation was proportional to the increase in overall tyrosine protein phosphorylation observed in the various cell types (Fig. 1B). Importantly, an anti-Zap-70 immunoblot of Zap-70 immunoprecipitates verified that the augmented tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap-70 was not due to a change in its cellular abundance (Fig. 1A, bottompanel). It should be pointed out that Zap-70 immunoprecipitates from TCR-stimulated cells also contained a tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide of approximately 120 kDa (p120) (Fig. 1A). The accumulation of p120 was clearly greater in cells containing F505 Lck (lanes 8-12) when compared with neomycin-resistant cells (lanes 1-6). Moreover, it tended to be more rapid and more sustained in F528 FynT-expressing cells (lanes 14-18). The nature of p120 will be further discussed below. In addition, immunoprecipitates of Zap-70 possessed tyrosine-phosphorylated products of 85, 78, and 60 kDa. These polypeptides represent post-translationally modified versions of Zap-70.2 The impact of the activated Src-like enzymes on the ability of Zap-70 to associate with TCR was also determined. Cells were stimulated with anti-TCR MAb F23.1 and RAM IgG, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following cell lysis, TCR complexes were collected by the addition of S. aureus protein A. After several washes, associated Zap-70 molecules were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Zap-70 antibodies. Untreated control cells were lysed immediately after incubation with MAb F23.1 prior to the addition of the second step antibody. In this case, immunoprecipitation of TCR was achieved by adding RAM IgG and S. aureus protein A to the cell lysate. In the absence of TCR stimulation, no or little Zap-70 was associated with TCR (Fig. 2A, lanes1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11). However, upon engagement of TCR, there was easily appreciable binding of Zap-70 to TCR (lanes2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). In comparison with expression of the neomycin phosphotransferase alone (lanes 1-4), introduction of activated p56lck (lanes 5-8) or activated p59fynT (lanes 9-12) caused a 10-fold enhancement of the extent of Zap-70 association with TCR. To determine the stoichiometry of these interactions, Zap-70 (Fig. 2B, lanes1-6) and TCR (lanes 7-12) were individually immunoprecipitated from increasing numbers of MAb F23.1-stimulated F505 p56lck-expressing cells. The abundance of Zap-70 in each of these immunoprecipitates was measured by anti-Zap-70 immunoblotting and was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. These data demonstrated that approximately 10% of Zap-70 was complexed to TCR in activated F505 p56lck-bearing cells. This quantitation is clearly exemplified by comparing the intensity of the signal in lane12 (which corresponds to 2 × 106 cells) with those in lanes3 and 4 (which correspond to 0.25 × 106 and 0.5 × 106 cells, respectively). A similar proportion of Zap-70 bound the TCR in F528 FynT-bearing cells (Fig. 2A, lanes10 and 12). In contrast, however, only 1% of Zap-70 molecules became associated with TCR in neomycin-resistant cells (Neo, lanes2 and 4). The association of Zap-70 with TCR is based on interactions between its two SH2 domains and the tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3 and/or Ζ subunits of TCR (Wange et al., 1993; Iwashima et al., 1994; Timson-Gauen et al., 1994). In light of this notion, we wanted to confirm that Lck and FynT increased the formation of TCR-Zap-70 complexes by promoting the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3/Ζ. Cells were stimulated with MAb F23.1 and RAM IgG and lysed in non-ionic detergent-containing buffer; TCR complexes were recovered by adsorption onto S. aureus protein A. After resolving immune complexes in 12% SDS-PAGE gels, tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). This assay revealed that the activated versions of Lck (lane4) and FynT (lane6) enhanced the TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of products of 16-20 kDa, consistent with the various phosphorylated forms of Ζ (Baniyash et al., 1988; Koyasu et al., 1992). TCR immunoprecipitates from activated cells also contained tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides of 23-28 kDa, which likely corresponded to components of the CD3 complex (Wange et al., 1992; Qian et al., 1993). These findings suggested that the ability of activated Src-related enzymes to facilitate the association of Zap-70 with TCR was indeed related to their efficiency at phosphorylating CD3/Ζ. To obtain further support for this conclusion, the kinetics and extent of CD3/Ζ tyrosine phosphorylation were compared with those of Zap-70 binding to TCR. Thus, TCR immunoprecipitates from resting or activated cells were immunoblotted with either anti-Zap-70 (Fig. 3B, toppanel) or anti-phosphotyrosine (bottompanel) antibodies. These assays showed that, both in neomycin-resistant cells (lanes1-6) and in cells containing F505 p56lck (lanes7-12), the onset and extent of Zap-70 association with TCR closely followed those of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3/Ζ. Moreover, the disappearance of TCR-bound Zap-70 (toppanel) clearly coincided with the loss of tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3/Ζ (bottompanel). Previous studies have shown that expression of CD4 greatly enhanced the antigen responsiveness of BI-141 cells (Ballhausen et al., 1988), a likely consequence of the ability of this cell surface molecule to bind and activate p56lck (Veillette et al., 1988b; Rudd et al., 1988; Veillette et al., 1989; Luo and Sefton, 1990). Therefore, to study the impact of p56lck activation in a more physiological context, we tested the effects of antibody-mediated ligation of CD4 on the properties of Zap-70. CD4-positive BI-141 derivatives were incubated with anti-TCR MAb F23.1, anti-CD4 MAb GK1.5, or MAb F23.1-MAb GK1.5 heteroconjugates and subsequently activated by addition of the appropriate second step antibody. Under these conditions, little or no tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was induced by ligation of TCR or CD4 alone (Fig. 4A, lanes12 and 13, respectively). In contrast, however, marked accumulation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was provoked by co-aggregating TCR and CD4 (lane14). Changes in Zap-70 tyrosine phosphorylation were monitored by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of Zap-70 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A, toppanel). Whereas ligation with anti-TCR MAb F23.1 alone (lane4) or anti-CD4 MAb GK1.5 alone (lane5) did not cause tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap-70, co-aggregation of TCR and CD4 (lane6) promptly increased the phosphotyrosine content of Zap-70 in a manner analogous to expression of F505 p56lck (lane8). Quantitative analyses of these data indicated that Zap-70 was seven times more tyrosine phosphorylated after co-aggregation of TCR and CD4 (lane6), when compared with stimulation of TCR alone (lane4). Co-ligation of TCR with CD4 also increased the recovery of tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 by approximately 5-fold (lane6). The extent of association of Zap-70 with TCR was also determined (Fig. 4B). Antibody-mediated co-aggregation of TCR and CD4 significantly enhanced the binding of Zap-70 to TCR (lane6). Indeed, while essentially no detectable Zap-70 was bound to TCR in MAb F23.1-stimulated cells (lane4), approximately 5% of these molecules became associated with TCR in cells treated with MAb F23.1-MAb GK1.5 heteroconjugates (lane6). Next, we surveyed the relative distribution of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 molecules in activated BI-141 cells. TCR- and non-TCR-associated Zap-70 were fractionated by sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-TCR and anti-Zap-70 antibodies. The phosphotyrosine content of these two populations was then determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 5A, toppanel). The abundance of Zap-70 in these two fractions was also measured by anti-Zap-70 immunoblotting (bottompanel). In the various BI-141 derivatives tested, the majority of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 molecules was not stably associated with TCR (compare lane2 with lane8; lane4 with lane10; and lane6 with lane12). A time course of activation of F505 Lck-containing cells revealed that the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 with TCR was transient, peaking at 1 min after TCR stimulation (Fig. 5B, toppanel, lanes1-6). In contrast, the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 was more sustained in TCR-depleted lysates (lanes 7-12, toppanel). Indeed, it persisted up to 10 min after the onset of TCR stimulation (lane12). These studies also showed that tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 was present in Zap-70 immunoprecipitates obtained from TCR-depleted lysates (lanes7-12). However, it was not detected in anti-TCR immunoprecipitates (lanes 1-6), even upon longer autoradiographic exposure (data not shown). Because the association of CD3/Ζ with TCR can be dissociated by non-ionic detergents such as Nonidet P-40, we wished to verify that the detection of a non-TCR-bound pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 was not consequent to artificial dissociation of CD3/Ζ from TCR. To this end, TCR-depleted lysates were re-immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against Zap-70 (Fig. 6, lane3), Ζ (lanes4 and 5), or CD3-ϵ (lane6), and recovered polypeptides were probed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. While abundant quantities of phosphotyrosine-containing Zap-70 were present in TCR-depleted lysates (lane3, toppanel), these lysates contained little or no tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3 or Ζ (lanes4, 5, and 6, bottompanel). Since the association of Zap-70 with CD3/Ζ is known to be resistant to the presence of Nonidet P-40 (Chan et al., 1991), this observation implied that the accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 in TCR-depleted lysates was not due to post-lysis dissociation of CD3/Ζ from TCR. The experiments depicted above indicated that a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide (p120) was present in anti-Zap-70, but not anti-TCR, immunoprecipitates from activated BI-141 cells (Fig. 1A, Fig. 4A, and Fig. 5B). To characterize this product, we first wanted to ensure that it was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with Zap-70. In the study shown in Fig. 7A, no appreciable amount of p120 was present in either anti-Lck (lane2) or anti-Fyn (lane3) immunoprecipitates or in immune complexes obtained using pre-immune serum (lane1). In keeping with former reports, however (da Silva et al., 1993; Tsygankov et al., 1994; Reedquist et al., 1994), small quantities of a tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 were observed in anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates upon longer autoradiographic exposures of this immunoblot (data not shown). It is not known whether this polypeptide was identical to the p120 found in anti-Zap-70 immunoprecipitates. In a previous publication (Weil and Veillette, 1994), we also demonstrated that p120 was not present in immunoprecipitates of phospholipase C-γ1, Vav, ezrin, Hcp, and Shc. Two independent rabbit antisera generated against the linker region of Zap-70, as well as a polyclonal rabbit serum recognizing the SH2 domains of Zap-70, were evaluated in our assays (Fig. 7B). The two anti-linker sera were equally efficient at recovering the tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 (lanes2 and 4). The antiserum reacting with the Zap-70 SH2 domains also precipitated p120 (lane6), albeit at a lower efficiency. This serum was also less adequate at immunoprecipitating Zap-70 (lane6; data not shown). Similar data were obtained using an antiserum against the carboxyl terminus of Zap-70 (data not shown). Perhaps the antibodies directed against the linker region (which lies between the end of the second SH2 domain and the beginning of the catalytic region) stabilized the interaction of Zap-70 with p120, thus facilitating its recovery. Alternatively, the anti-SH2 domains and anti-carboxyl terminus sera may have lowered the immunoprecipitation of p120 by causing its displacement from Zap-70. These results implied that p120 specifically interacted with Zap-70 in activated BI-141 cells. To better understand the basis for this interaction, the effects of denaturation were examined (Fig. 7C). Cells were lysed either in standard Nonidet P-40-containing buffer (lanes1-6) or in boiling SDS-containing buffer (lanes7-12) prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-Zap-70 antibodies. An anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot of these immunoprecipitates revealed that the presence of SDS completely abolished the association of p120 with Zap-70 (lanes7-12). Although the ability to immunoprecipitate Zap-70 was also partially reduced in the SDS-containing buffer, this diminution was probably consequent to the added ionic strength provided by the detergent. The potential involvement of tyrosine-phosphorylated residues in the formation of this complex was also evaluated (Fig. 7D). Zap-70 was immunoprecipitated in the absence or presence of progressively higher concentrations of either phenylphosphate, an analog of phosphotyrosine (lanes2-6), or phosphoserine (lanes 8-12). A subsequent anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot showed that phenylphosphate caused a dose-dependent dissociation of p120 from Zap-70 (lanes 2-6), which was nearly complete at a concentration of 50 mM (lane5). A similar effect was obtained with phosphotyrosine (data not shown). In contrast, however, equivalent concentrations of phosphoserine failed to interfere with the binding of p120 to Zap-70 (lanes 8-12). In an attempt to identify p120, lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against known tyrosine phosphorylation substrates of approximately 120 kDa. The phosphotyrosine content of these products in activated BI-141 cells was then measured by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 8). No significant tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in immunoprecipitates of the 110-kDa phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase (precipitated with anti-p85 antibodies) (lane3), the 110-kDa actin-binding protein p110 (lane4), the 120-kDa GTPase-activating protein of p21ras (lane5), and the integrin-regulated tyrosine protein kinase p125fak (lanes6 and 7). Recent data also demonstrated that p120c-cbl, the cellular homolog of the Cbl oncoprotein, undergoes prominent tyrosine phosphorylation in activated Jurkat T-cells (Donovan et al., 1994). While anti-Cbl antibodies also identified a prominent 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in activated BI-141 cells (Fig. 8B, lane3), this polypeptide was not detectably associated with Zap-70. Based on this result, it appeared unlikely that the 120-kDa Zap-associated protein was Cbl. In this paper, we have studied the regulation of Zap-70 in the antigen-specific T-cell line BI-141. We found that expression of activated versions of p56lck or p59fynTcaused an appreciable increase in the rapidity, intensity, and duration of Zap-70 tyrosine phosphorylation during T-cell activation (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, using CD4-positive BI-141 derivatives, it was observed that antibody-mediated aggregation of TCR with the CD4 co-receptor allowed a greater accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 (Fig. 4A). As ligation of CD4 is known to activate p56lck (Veillette et al., 1989; Luo and Sefton, 1990), this observation further supported the notion that the recruitment of Zap-70 in TCR signaling is regulated by Src-like enzymes. We also demonstrated that activated Lck and FynT, as well as co-ligation of TCR with CD4, increased the extent of Zap-70 association with TCR by 5-10-fold (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4B). Importantly, this enhancement paralleled the ability of Lck and FynT to promote CD3 and Ζ tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Indeed, in careful time-course analyses, it was shown that the accumulation of TCR•Zap-70 complexes in activated T-cells coincided with the induction of CD3/Ζ tyrosine phosphorylation. Given the sensitivity of the anti-Zap-70 antibodies used in our studies, we were able to obtain an assessment of the stoichiometry of association of Zap-70 with TCR. Under linear assay conditions, it was estimated that roughly 1% of Zap-70 molecules became bound to TCR in activated neomycin-resistant BI-141 T-cells. This proportion rose to ∼10% in cells bearing activated versions of p56lck or p59fynT Furthermore, in CD4-positive BI-141 derivatives, approximately 5% of Zap-70 polypeptides became associated with TCR upon co-aggregation of TCR with CD4. Together, these observations supported the model proposed by others (Chan et al., 1992; Iwashima et al., 1994; Timson-Gauen et al., 1994), which was primarily based on reconstitution experiments in non-lymphoid cells. Seemingly, engagement of TCR triggers the T-cell activation cascade by allowing Lck and/or FynT to phosphorylate CD3/Ζ. This phosphorylation allows the recruitment of Zap-70 at the membrane, where it is susceptible to phosphorylation by Src-related enzymes. Membrane-associated and tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 is presumably able to phosphorylate its putative targets and/or to behave as a docking molecule, capable of recruiting additional signal transducers at the plasma membrane. These concepts are somewhat complicated by the finding that two distinct pools of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 molecules were present in activated BI-141 cells (Fig. 5). Whereas one pool was stably associated with TCR, thus fulfilling the scheme described above, a second more prominent population was not detectably associated with TCR. In light of this observation, special efforts were made to rule out the possibility that the non-TCR-bound Zap-70 was produced as a result of artificial dissociation of CD3/Ζ from TCR (Fig. 6). However, we felt confident that our TCR immunoprecipitates contained essentially all the tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3/Ζ molecules from activated BI-141 cells. Coupled with the fact that the interaction between CD3/Ζ and Zap-70 is not affected by lysis conditions similar to those used in our studies (Chan et al., 1991), it thus appeared unlikely that the existence of non-TCR-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 was consequent to in vitro disruption of the antigen receptor complex. The mechanisms of production, as well as the functions of these two groups of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 remain to be clarified. Our kinetics analyses indicated that the presence of TCR-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 was transient in activated T-cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the accumulation of non-TCR-associated polypeptides tended to be more sustained. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of both pools of Zap-70 was increased by activated Src-related enzymes (Fig. 5A), it is conceivable that they had a common origin. Possibly, the non-TCR-associated population was generated following in vivo dissociation of the TCR-bound pool, perhaps as a consequence of CD3/Ζ dephosphorylation. Although it seems somewhat less likely, it remains also possible that the two populations of Zap-70 were produced through distinct processes. Future studies will be necessary to test these possibilities. Interestingly, we noted that non-TCR-associated Zap-70 molecules from activated BI-141 cells specifically co-immunoprecipitated with a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide. In addition to lending credence to the notion that the two pools of Zap-70 may serve distinct functions during TCR signaling, this finding intimated that p120 may be either a substrate or a regulator of Zap-70. Unfortunately, however, we have not yet been able to define the identity of p120. Our results indicated that the Zap-70-associated p120 was not the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase, GTPase-activating protein, p125fak, or the 110-kDa actin-binding protein (p110) (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, it did not appear to be Cbl, a 120-kDa polypeptide recently shown to undergo prominent tyrosine phosphorylation in activated T-lymphocytes (Fig. 8B) (Donovan et al., 1994). While not formally excluded, it is also improbable that p120 was a protein kinase, as it failed to undergo phosphorylation during immune complex kinase reactions.2 Additional biochemical characterizations showed that the Zap-70•p120 complex was dissociated by boiling in the presence of SDS, implying that it was non-covalent in nature (Fig. 7C). Moreover, it could be disrupted by either phenylphosphate (Fig. 7D) or phosphotyrosine (data not shown), suggesting that it was dependent on the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine residues. However, the complex did not apparently involve the SH2 domains of Zap-70, as recombinant fusion proteins bearing this portion of Zap-70 could not recover tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 from activated T-cell lysates.2 Therefore, the putative critical sites of tyrosine phosphorylation may be situated on Zap-70 itself. Obviously, further characterization of p120 is likely to provide useful insights into the regulation and function(s) of Zap-70 in T-lymphocytes. A recent report suggested that Syk, a Zap-70-related tyrosine protein kinase expressed in at least some T-cells, also plays a prominent role in T-cell receptor signaling (Couture et al., 1994). It was observed that, unlike Zap-70, Syk is constitutively associated with TCR. Furthermore, the authors reported that TCR stimulation caused an activation of the catalytic function of Syk. They proposed that Syk-mediated signals during T-cell activation may be more proximal than those provided by Src-related enzymes or Zap-70. While it is possible that this scheme applies to a subset of T-cells, it should be pointed out that we have been unable to detect expression of Syk in BI-141 T-cells, using at least two different anti-Syk sera.2 Hence, based on our data, Syk is clearly not an essential component of the TCR signaling pathway. In summary, we have shown that the ability of Zap-70 to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and associate with TCR is markedly enhanced by expression of activated forms of p56lck and p59fynTor by ligation of TCR with the CD4 co-receptor. The extent and duration of Zap-70 association with TCR correlated with those of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 and Ζ, thus supporting the notion that Src-related enzymes initiate TCR-mediated signals by catalyzing the tyrosine phosphorylation of these TCR components. Our studies also allowed the identification of two distinct pools of tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 in activated T-cells. Whereas one pool was associated with TCR, the other was devoid of demonstrable interactions with this structure. Even though the nature and function of these two populations were not determined, it was observed that the non-TCR-associated fraction specifically co-immunoprecipitated with a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide of yet undefined identity. These data definitely add further complexity to previous models of regulation of Zap-70. Furthermore, they suggest that p120 may be a target and/or a regulator of Zap-70 in activated T-lymphocytes.

J. Microbiol. 35, 499-507), and the other (MTH) is coenzyme F420-independent (or hydrogenase-type) and oxygen-sensitive (Zirngibl, C., Hedderich, R., and Thauer, R. K.(1990) FEBS Lett. 261, 112-116). Based on the NH 2-terminal sequence of MTD, a 36-mer oligonucleotide was designed and used to identify and clone a 6.1-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment of M. thermoautotrophicum DNA. Sequencing of this fragment revealed an 825-base pair (bp) MTD encoding gene (mtd), which was expressed in Escherichia coli yielding an enzyme that, like the native enzyme, was oxygen-stable, strictly dependent on coenzyme F420, thermostable, thermophilic, and exhibited maximum activity at an acidic pH. The amino acid sequence predicts that MTD is a hydrophobic and acidic protein with no identifiable homology to MTH (von Bunau, R., Zirngibl, C., Thauer, R. K., and Klein, A.(1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 202, 1205-1208), but comparisons with coenzyme F420 utilizing enzymes revealed a conserved region at the NH2 terminus of MTD that could correspond to the ability to interact with coenzyme F420. The mtd transcript was ∼900 nucleotides long and initiated 8 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and 22 bp downstream from an archaeal promoter sequence. The mtd coding sequence was followed by several poly(dT) sequences and an inverted repeat that could be transcription termination signals.

Biochem. 202, 1205-1208), but comparisons with coenzyme F420 utilizing enzymes revealed a conserved region at the NH2 terminus of MTD that could correspond to the ability to interact with coenzyme F420. The mtd transcript was ∼900 nucleotides long and initiated 8 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and 22 bp downstream from an archaeal promoter sequence. The mtd coding sequence was followed by several poly(dT) sequences and an inverted repeat that could be transcription termination signals."
https://openalex.org/W2108645522,"FP21 is a glycoprotein which, when tracked by radioactivity in its fucosyl moiety, was previously detected in the cytosol of Dictyostelium cells after cell fractionation. This compartmentalization is confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Western blotting of cell fractions using three different antibodies. Although a substantial fraction of FP21 is also detected in the particulate fraction using these new antibodies, particulate FP21 is released by disrupting protein-protein interactions, but not membrane disruption. Since purified FP21 is susceptible to aggregation, and purified nuclei do not contain FP21, particulate FP21 is also part of the cytosol. Additional compositional and structural information provides strong evidence that FP21 does not at any time traverse the rough endoplasmic reticulum. First, cDNAs spanning the entire coding region of the FP21 gene predict no hydrophobic motifs expected to promote membrane insertion, but do predict an NH2-terminal coiled coil domain which could explain aggregation. Second, monosaccharide composition analysis of the predominant glycoform of FP21 yields 2 mol of galactose, 1 mol of xylose, and 1 mol of fucose/mol of polypeptide; FP21 from a fucosylation-defective mutant contains 1 additional mol of xylose in place of fucose. Thus the N-glycosylation sequon present in FP21 is not utilized by oligosaccharyl transferase, which resides in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These findings indicate that nascent FP21 remains in the cytosol after synthesis and is therefore glycosylated by unusual cytosolic xylosyl-, galactosyl-, and fucosyltransferases.

To study the importance of this residue in IGF-I receptor function, we mutated the analogous tryptophan residue at position 1173 of the IGF-I receptor to serine and overexpressed the mutant receptor in NIH-3T3 cells. In cell lines overexpressing this mutant IGF-I receptor, β subunit autophosphorylation was severely reduced. Additionally, the overexpressed mutant receptors exhibited a dominant-negative effect on IGF-I-stimulated autophosphorylation of endogenous mouse IGF-I receptors. Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 in intact cells by the mutant IGF-I receptors was similar to the level of IRS-1 phosphorylation seen in the parental NIH-3T3 cells, but there was no obvious dominant-negative effect on IRS-1 phosphorylation. Wheat germ agglutinin-purified mutant receptors were as active in phosphorylating poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 as wild-type IGF-I receptors, suggesting that, in intact cells, additional factors are necessary in order for the IGF-I receptor to phosphorylate IRS-1. Thymidine incorporation was severely reduced in one clone overexpressing the mutant IGF-I receptor and abolished in a second clone. Glucose uptake in both clones was reduced to about half of that seen in a cell line overexpressing wild-type IGF-I receptors. Thus, we propose that the tryptophan residue at position 1173 of the IGF-I receptor is important in the regulation of autophosphorylation in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1967084652,"The extracellular domains of the two human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors critical for binding TNF-α were examined by deletion mapping. The ligand binding capability of full-length and truncated recombinant soluble TNF receptors (TNFRs) was assessed by ligand blot analysis and their binding affinity determined by Scatchard analysis. The results showed that deletion of the fourth cysteine-rich domain of the p55 receptor (TNFR-1) did not alter ligand binding affinity significantly. Deletion of domains 3 and 4 of TNFR-1 resulted in no ligand binding, suggesting that domain 3, but not 4, of TNFR-1 binds directly to ligand. Deletion of domain 4 of TNFR-2 resulted in drastically reduced protein yield and 3-fold reduction in ligand binding affinity, while deletion of both domains 4 and 3 yielded no protein. Thus, the domain 4 of TNFR-2, but not that of TNFR-1, appears to be involved directly in binding TNF, although it is also possible that the domain 4 of TNFR-2 is involved in the correct folding of other domains.

They belong to a receptor gene superfamily that includes nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, CD27, CD30, CD40, Fas antigen, and a TNFR-related receptor protein for membrane-bound LT-β(19Beutler B.

The intracellular domains of the two TNF receptors share no similarity. They may interact with different intracellular entities to trigger different signal transduction pathways(21Tartaglia L.

Members of TNF/NGF receptor superfamily have three to six conserved cysteine-rich repeat motifs in their extracellular domain. Of the four cysteine repeats in both TNF receptors, the fourth motif and its downstream sequence up to the transmembrane domain (14Hohmann H.-P. Remy R. Brockhaus M. van Loon A.P.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14927-14934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are the least similar. Mutational analyses of TNF indicated that the intersubunit grooves of TNF trimer form at least part of the receptor binding site(6Zhang X.-M. Weber I.T. Chen M.-J. J. Biol.

Recently, Banner et al.(24Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W.

The receptor fragments in the complex showed that the four sequence domains defined by the cysteine repeat motifs were arranged, end to end, in a linear fashion with little overlap. A direct involvement of the second and the third cysteine-rich domains in ligand binding was also shown. The fourth cysteine-rich domain and its downstream sequence (domain 4) of hTNFR-1 in the complex is rather disordered and appears not to be involved in ligand binding. However, results from two independent peptide mapping studies suggested otherwise; a 20-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the domain 4 sequence of TNFR-1 and a 21-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the last 9 amino acids of domain 3 plus 12 amino acids in the beginning of domain 4 were found to inhibit both TNF-α receptor binding and in vitro cytotoxic activity(25Hwang C.

These two peptides cover a region apparently not involved in hTNFR-1 binding in the crystal structure. These data suggest that TNF-α and TNF-β may have different modes of binding TNFR-1. The binding domain of TNFR-2 has not been defined for either TNF-α or TNF-β. To compare the mode of ligand-receptor interaction between TNF-α and its dual receptors, we expressed full-length and serial C-terminal domain-truncated recombinant soluble receptors of the two human TNFRs in baculovirus expression system and compared their ligand binding capability. The data suggested that the domain 4 of TNFR-2, but not that of TNFR-1, are involved directly in binding TNF-α. Domain 4 of TNFR-2 may be also involved in the correct folding of other domains. These results also suggested the existence of a unique TNFR-2 binding site on the TNF molecule susceptible to manipulation for specific TNF receptor modulation for the development of better TNF-based therapeutic agents. The Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and High-Five insect cell lines were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). BacPAK6, genomic DNA from a derivative of Autographa california (AcMNPV) baculovirus, and transfer vector pBacPAK9 were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant hTNF-α was iodinated with Na125I (Amersham Corp., ICN, or DuPont NEN) and IODOGEN (Pierce) as described(6Zhang X.-M. Weber I.T. Chen M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24069-24075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmid DNA samples for transfection or DNA sequencing were prepared with Qiagen plasmid preparation kits (Chatsworth, CA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplifications were performed using a Perkin-Elmer kit and a model 9600 DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer). Human TNFR cDNAs were kind gifts of Immunex (Seattle, Washington). The four extracellular domains of hTNFRs are defined here as the four cysteine-rich motifs defined by Banner et al.(24Banner D.W.

Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) except that the domain 4 includes downstream sequence up to the transmembrane domain. Expression vectors of the full-length and serial C-terminal domain truncated forms of the two hTNFRs were generated by PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotide primer pairs: full-length sTNFR-1 (P1/P2), domain 4-deleted sTNFR-1 (P1/P3), domain 3- and 4-deleted sTNFR-1 (P1/P4); full-length sTNFR-2 (P5/P6), domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2 (P5/P7), domain 3- and 4-deleted sTNFR-2 (P5/P8). Starting from the 5′ end, the sequences of the primers are the following: P1, CATAGGGATCCACCATGGGCCTCTCCACCGTGC; P2, TGACCAGGGTCTAGAGTTATGTGGTGCCTGAGTCCTC; P3, AAGAGCTTCTAGATTTAGGTGCACACGGTGTTCTG; P4, TTGTCCTTCTAGATTTAGCCACACACGGTGTCCCG; P5, CCCGCGGATCCACCATG-GCGCCCGTCGCCGTC; P6, CAACTGGTCTAGATTAGTCGCCAG-TGCTCCCTTCAG; P7, CCTCGGTCTAGATTACTTGCACACCAC-GTCTGAT; P8, ACCAGATTCTAGATTAGGTGCAGATGCGGTTCTGTT. After removal of primers using size selecting filters (Centricon 30 from Amicon, Beverly, MA, or Ultrafree-MC from Millipore, Bedford, MA), PCR products were cut with BamHI/XbaI and ligated with BamHI/XbaI-cut transfer vectors pBacPAK9. The 5′ primers have a BamHI site introduced upstream to ATG start codon followed by the signal peptide sequence of the hTNFRs. The 3′ primers have an XbaI site introduced downstream to a stop codon placed at the end of the extracellular domain sequence or at the end of domain 3 or 2 sequence for expressing truncated soluble receptors. Expression with Sf9 cells was performed according to the manual provided by Invitrogen (San Diego, CA): Sf-9 cells maintained in suspension culture at 27°C in TNM-FH medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) were used to produce recombinant viruses. Transfer vector DNAs and linear BacPAK6 were co-transfected into log phase Sf-9 cells, and recombinant viruses were purified by at least two rounds of plaque assay followed by PCR screening using flanking primers. For recombinant protein production, High-Five cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/265-cm2 flask in 35 ml of serum-free Ex-cell 400 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and grown to about 80% confluence (about 3 × 107 cells/flask in 3 days) before infecting with recombinant virus at a mutiplicity of infection of 5. Seventy-two hours after viral infection, culture supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, followed by passing through a 0.2-μm filter. Recombinant receptors were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining or Coomassie Blue staining, and purified by ligand affinity chromatography as described below. PUC118tnf human TNF-α mutagenesis/expression vector has been described(6Zhang X.-M. Weber I.T. Chen M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24069-24075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PUC118tnf-transformed E. coli MV1190 was pelleted by centifugation and resuspended in 25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, with 1.0 mM each of DTT, EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0.3 g/ml. The suspension was sonicated extensively at 4°C and clarified by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. After passing through a Nalgene 0.8 μM cellulose acetate membrane, the supernatant was applied to an S-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, 1 mM DTT. The column was then washed with 5-10 column volumes of 0.2 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, and eluted with a linear gradient (0.2-1.0 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM DTT) at a flow rate of 2.3 ml/min. Fractions containing TNF-α were identified by Western blot analysis as described(6Zhang X.-M. Weber I.T. Chen M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24069-24075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 mM DTT and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with dialysis buffer. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (10-200 mM). Fractions containing TNF were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C, or else dialyzed against 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at −20°C. Recombinant soluble receptors, affinity-purified or in crude culture supernatant, were fractionated on a reducing Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel with 2%β-mercaptoethanol in the loading samples followed by Coomassie Blue or silver staining as described(6Zhang X.-M. Weber I.T. Chen M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24069-24075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Silver stain kits were from Boehringer Mannheim or LabLogix (Belmont, CA) and were used according to the supplier's manual. Purified rhTNF-α was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the protocol provided by Pharmacia (capacity 16-32 mg/g) with the following modifications. The gel was swollen with 1 mM of HCl and washed three times for 5 min each, using a total of 200 ml of 1 mM HCl/g of gel. rTNF was dissolved at 7.5 mg/3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and dialyzed three times against 500 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5 M NaCl. The volume of the ligand was made up to 5 ml with the same buffer and mixed with the washed gel (2.5 mg of rTNF/ml of swollen gel slurry) by rotating gently overnight at 4°C. Excess ligand was washed away with the same buffer, and the remaining active groups were blocked with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 for 2 h at room temperature. The gel was then washed with 3 cycles of alternative pH, using 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, each containing 0.5 M NaCl. The conjugate was stored in PBS at 4°C. Clarified infected High-Five cell culture supernatant from one T265 flask was passed through a 0.5-ml TNF affinity column by gravity. After washing with 10 ml of PBS, the column was eluted with seven 500-μl aliquots of 100 mM glycine, 100 mM NaCl, pH 2.6, into microcentrifuge tubes containing 50 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions were analyzed on a 12% Laemmli gel followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Supernatants from recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cell cultures were passed through Sephadex G-15 column (gel swollen in H2O), lyophilized, and resuspended in 0.1 volume of H2O. Aliquots (10 μl) of High-Five cell culture supernatant or 10-fold concentrated Sf9 cell culture supernatant were fractionated on a 12% non-reducing SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, the filter was incubated with 1 μCi of 125I-hTNF-α (400-800 Ci/mmol) at room temperature for 4 h, washed three times with PBS, and exposed to x-ray films for 1-3 days. The N-terminal sequence of the purified sTNFRs were analyzed as follows: purified receptors were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Immobilon membrane filters (Millipore, Belford, MA), and the protein visualized by Coomassie Blue staining as described above. The protein bands were excised from the membrane, placed in a reaction cartridge, and 20-30 cycles of Edman degradation were performed using standard protocols on an Applied Biosystems 477A-120A protein sequencer. Purified rhTNF-α (>50 pmol) was subjected to end sequence analysis directly and the data used to calculate the concentration of the TNF sample. Homogeneous rhTNF-α in PBS has an optical density of 2 A280/mg protein. Direct solid phase ligand binding assays were performed as follows; 96-well microtiter plates (Immunolon-4, Removawell, Dynatech) were coated overnight at 4°C with 25 ng and 100 ng/100 μl/well of affinity-purified full-length or truncated sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2, respectively. Each sample was diluted at least 100-fold in PBS beforehand. After blocking for 2 h with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS, the wells were washed with PBS and incubated with increasing amount of 125I-TNF in the same buffer. Control assays contained 300-fold excess of cold TNF. The wells were then washed four times with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and counted in a γ-counter after binding for 4 h at room temperature. Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by Scatchard analysis(30Rosenthal H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and ligand blot analyses were used to determine the level of rsTNFRs expression and their ligand binding capability. Fig. 1 shows the result of SDS-PAGE analyses of High-Five cell secreted full-length (24-28-kDa bands in lanes2 and 3) and domain 4-deleted sTNFR-1 (20-24-kDa bands in lanes4 and 5), as well as full-length (32-37-kDa bands in lanes6 and 7) and domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2 (16-17-kDa bands in lanes8 and 9). Each pair of lanes represents results obtained with two independent recombinant virus isolates. The molecular mass values of the core proteins predicted from the DNA sequence of the expression constructs are 20 kDa (182 amino acids) and 26 kDa (235 amino acids) for sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2, respectively. Glycosylation thus contributes at least 4-8 and 6-11 kDa to the molecular weight of sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2, respectively. With the context of the DNA sequence surrounding the ribosomal binding site modified according to Kozak's rules (28Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) in the expression vector, the recombinant baculovirus infected High-Five cells, 3 × 107 cells in a 265-cm2 ridged T-flask in 35 ml of culture medium, secreted 60-90 and 30-60 μg/ml full-length sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2, respectively, 20-30 μg/ml domain 4-deleted sTNFR-1 (sTNFR-1ΔD4), and about 3-5 μg/ml domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2 (sTNFR-2ΔD4), into the medium after 3-5 days in culture, as estimated from silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1). Recombinant sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2 constitute about 10 and 5% of the total secreted proteins, respectively. The levels of expression of the full-length soluble receptors are at least 10-fold higher than those obtained from Sf9 cells previously used by us and by others(29Loetscher H. Gentz R. Zulauf M. Lustig A. Tabuchi H. Schlaeger E.-J. Brockhaus M. Gallati H. Mannberg M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18324-18329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the SDS-PAGE/silver staining (panel A) and ligand blot (panelB) analyses of full-length and truncated sTNFR-1. sTNFR-1 with domain 4 deleted or with both domain 4 and 3 deleted were produced at about one third of the full-length sTNFR-1 (panelA, lanes 1-6). While domain 4-deleted and full-length sTNFR-1 bind equally well to ligand (panel B, lanes1-4), sTNFR-1 with domain 3 and 4 deleted shows no 125I-TNF binding (panel B, lanes 5 and 6). This result suggests that domain 3 but not domain 4 of sTNFR-1 is involved in ligand binding. On the other hand, domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2 was produced in greatly reduced yield as compared to the full-length counterpart (Fig. 1, lanes8 and 9). No recombinant protein was detectable when both domain 4 and 3 of TNFR-2 were deleted (data not shown). Ligand blot analysis using crude culture supernatants suggested that domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2 bound TNF-α poorly, and that sTNFR-2 with both domains 3 and 4 deleted did not bind TNF-α (data not shown). To better assess the ligand binding capability of full-length and domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2, they were affinity-purified before ligand blot analysis. Contrary to the results for domain 4-deleted and full-length sTNFR-1, Fig. 3(panelB) showed that domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2 (lanes 3 and 4) binds poorly to ligand as compared to the full-length sTNFR-2 (panelB, lane1 and 2). An identical SDS-PAGE gel stained with silver on the left (Fig. 3, panelA) assured that comparable amount of full-length (lanes 1 and 2) and domain 4-deleted sTNFR-2 (lanes 3 and 4) have been loaded in SDS-PAGE gel used for ligand blot analysis. A direct solid phase ligand binding assay was used to determine the binding affinity of purified sTNFRs by Scatchard analysis(30Rosenthal H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Results for one of the four ligand binding experiments are shown in Fig. 4. Panels A-D on the left are binding curves and Scatchard plots of full-length and domain 4-deleted sTNFR-1, and panelsE-H are those of sTNFR-2. Ligand binding dissociation constants (Kd) were estimated from the slopes of the Scatchard plots and average values from four separate experiments, using four different preparations of 125I-TNF and soluble receptor preparations, are listed in Table 1. Full-length sTNFR-2 (average Kd of 0.35 nM) binds TNF 3 times better than sTNFR-1 (average Kd of 1.23 nM). The Kd ratio for the domain 4-deleted sTNFR-1 to the full-length sTNFR-1 was 0.93, indicating that deletion of domain 4 of sTNFR-1 did not affect binding capacity substantially. These data suggested that domain 4 of sTNFR-1 is not involved directly in ligand binding. On the contrary, deletion of domain 4 of sTNFR-2 reduced binding affinity by 3-fold (see Kd ratio in Table 1), suggesting that the domain 4 of TNFR-2 may be also involved directly in ligand binding and/or the folding of the ligand binding domain.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The crystal structure determined by Banner et al.(24Banner D.W.

The receptor fragment, a very elongated end to end assembly of four similar domains, each representing one of the four conserved extracellular cysteine-rich domains, binds in the groove between two adjacent TNF-β subunits. The complex also shows that domain 2 and a small region of domain 3 bind ligand, while domain 4 is further from TNF. Domain 4 is described as disordered, which is unfortunate since synthetic peptides derived from the domain 4 sequence of hTNFR-1, and polyclonal antibodies against the synthetic peptides, were able to inhibit 125I-TNF binding to cell surface receptors and TNF in vitro cytotoxocity(25Hwang C.

Mizukami Y. Fukuda H. Kikuchi H. Kato S. Numao N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that domain 4 of TNFR-1 also bind TNF. Our data reported here suggested that domain 4 of TNFR-2, but not that of TNFR-1, is involved directly in ligand binding. Our data also suggest that domain 3 of TNFR-1 is involved in ligand binding, since its deletion resulted in truncated receptor unable to bind ligand (Fig. 2). However, if domain 4 of TNFR-1 is involved in ligand binding as peptide mapping results suggested, it may be that the interaction between TNF-α and domain 4 is much weaker than the sum of its interactions with other domains, thus escaping detection by our methods, even though it may be detectable with a very high concentration of proper peptides derived from domain 4 sequence of TNFR-1. The structure of TNF-β•TNFR-1 complex implied that domain 4 is away from TNF if the four domains of the receptor were arranged in a linear fashion as assumed; therefore, unless the structure of TNF-α•TNFR-1 differs substantially from that of the reported structure of TNF-β•TNFR-1(24Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), in order for domain 4 to bind TNF-α or -β, it would have to wrap around the same TNF trimer or bind to another TNF trimer in the crystal. Because the structure of domain 4, either in the ligand-receptor complex or in the uncomplexed receptor, has not been determined, this possibility cannot be ruled out. The data also suggested that not all domains of sTNFR-2 are folded independently, since the deletion of domain 4 of sTNFR-2 resulted in drastically reduced yield of sTNFRs secreted from recombinant virus infected insect cells. Improper folding during biosynthesis may result in proteins more prone to protease digestion. In addition, the results reported here suggested that the domain 4 of TNFR-2, but not that of TNFR-1, is involved in binding rhTNF-α, either directly and/or through indirect effect on the conformation of the rest of the molecule. If the domain 4 of TNFR-2 is involved directly in ligand binding, TNFR-2 may interact with TNF-α differently from TNFR-1. Since cell surface and soluble TNFR-2 bind TNF-α with higher affinity than TNFR-1(31Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), there may be a unique domain on TNF-α, but not on TNF-β, that interacts specifically with TNFR-2, thereby contributing additional free energy of binding to increase the binding affinity of TNF-α for TNFR-2 severalfold over its binding affinity for TNFR-1 (see Kd ratio in Table 1). In fact, monoclonal antibody against TNF-α has been used to show recognition of distinct regions of TNF-α by different tumor cell receptors(32Rathjen D.A. Cowan K. Furphy L.J. Aston R. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is possible since the domain 4 of TNFR-2, including the fourth cysteine-rich motif and the downstream spacer region up to the transmembrane domain, is much longer than that of TNFR-1. This region, therefore, may not only confer more flexibility on cell surface for TNFR-2, but also enhance its binding affinity for TNF-α. Moreover, although TNF-α and TNF-β share a similar folding pattern, the two are not identical in structural details. Particularly noticeable are longer loops present at the top of the bell-shaped molecule of TNF-α, which extends upward from the area in which TNF-β was shown to bind domain 3 of TNFR-1 in the crystal structure of TNF-β•sTNFR-1 complex(24Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Six amino acids in these loops in TNF-α have been shown to confer an unique lectin-like binding activity(33Lucas R. Magez S. De Leys R. Frasen L. Scheerlinck J.-P. Rampelberg M. Sablon E. De Baetselier P. Science. 1994; 263: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Alon R. Cahalon L. Hershkoviz R. Elbaz D. Reizis B. Wallach D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Lider O. J.

Conceivably, the extra loop region may also provide additional binding sites for the domain 4 of TNFR-2, if not TNFR-1. It should also be mentioned that TNF-α and TNF-β share only limited sequence identity (about 50% similarity and 30% identity). Such is also the case with the extracellular domains of hTNFR-1 and hTNFR-2. It is therefore expected that the residues interacting in the four types of complexes formed between the two pairs of ligands and receptors may not all be identical, resulting in differential binding affinities. Recent mutational analyses of TNF-α found examples of single surface residue substitutions that resulted in the loss of binding capability to both receptors without obvious changes in the conformation of TNF-α(39Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Everaerdt B. Loetscher H. Gentz R.

The finding of several TNF mutants binding preferentially to either one of the two human TNFRs (39Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Everaerdt B. Loetscher H. Gentz R. Brovkhaus M. Lesslauer W. Tavernier J. Brouckaert P.

Cytokine Network. 1994; 5: 90Google Scholar) also supports the notion that TNF-α interacts differently with the two receptors. Of particular interest are the findings that mutations of contiguous residues on human TNF-α molecule resulted in opposite receptor binding preference(39Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Tao D. Chen P.C.-H. Weber I.T. Chen M.-J. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1994; 5: 90Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TNFR-1 mediates in vivo tumor killing, while TNFR-2 mediates TNF-induced systemic toxicity, which currently limits the therapeutic usefulness of TNF as an anticancer agent ((40Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Everaerdt B. Loetscher H. Gentz R. Brovkhaus M. Lesslauer W. Tavernier J. Brouckaert P. Fiers W.

Determination of the crystal structures of TNF-α•sTNFR-1, TNF-α•sTNFR-2, and TNF-β•sTNFR-2 complexes and comparison with the known structure of TNF-β•sTNFR-1 may reveal critical differences in the molecular interaction between each ligand and the dual receptors to guide future design of useful TNF receptor-specific therapeutic agent(s) with diminished side effects.

Chemical depolarization of the transverse tubular system (T-tubule) moiety of labeled triads after appropriate priming induced first a rapid increase of the fluorescence intensity of the JFP-bound MCA probe, and then sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release.

Blockers of T-tubule-to-SR communication, such as nimodipine and low concentration of neomycin, inhibited both the MCA fluorescence change and the SR Ca2+ release. In contrast, the release blocking concentration of Mg2+ (2 mM) inhibited only SR Ca2+ release without affecting the fluorescence change. These results suggest that upon T-tubule depolarization the original state of the JFP (R) isomerizes to an activated state with higher MCA fluorescence (∗R), which in turn changes into a subsequent state in which the release channel is open (∗Ro): R →∗R →∗Ro.

This in turn activates the Ca2+ channel in the JFP(9Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R.

The interaction between the two major proteins may be mediated by a direct contact via the cytoplasmic loop of the DHPR (12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7507-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).According to our recent study(16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the fluorescence intensity of the conformational probe MCA, which was incorporated into the JFP moiety in a site-specific manner, showed almost perfect parallelism to the activation/inhibition profile of SR Ca2+ release by Ca2+ and ryanodine. This suggested that the JFP conformational change may play an important role in the regulation of various types of Ca2+ release. The main goal of this study is to investigate the hitherto merely hypothetical JFP conformational change during excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling by means of the MCA probe technique (16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and of newly devised methods to produce voltage-controlled SR Ca2+ release in vitro(17Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we report that chemical depolarization of the T-tubule moiety of the triad produces a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity of the JFP-attached MCA probe (ΔF). The major findings are as follows. The rate of ΔF is much faster than that of Ca2+ release from the SR, indicating that the fluorescence change precedes Ca2+ release. Upon increasing the degree of ionic replacement, and thus the magnitude of T-tubule depolarization, both ΔF and the subsequent SR Ca2+ release increased in a parallel fashion. The DHP receptor antagonist nimodipine (cf. (18Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) or a novel blocker of the T-tubule-to-SR communication neomycin (19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) inhibited both ΔF and SR Ca2+ release. However, blocking of Ca2+ release by 2 mM Mg2+ had virtually no effect on ΔF. These results suggest that depolarization-induced SR Ca2+ release is mediated by a conformational change of the JFP, which is a prerequisite of the activation of the Ca2+ release channel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparationThe triad-enriched microsomal fraction (triad) was prepared from rabbit leg and back muscle by differential centrifugation as described previously(17Ikemoto N.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After the final centrifugation, the sedimented fraction was homogenized in a solution containing 0.3 M sucrose, 0.15 M potassium gluconate, proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.8 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) and 20 mM MES, pH 6.8 (PI buffer), to a final protein concentration of 20-30 mg/ml. The preparation was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C.Site-directed Labeling of the Junctional Foot Protein with the Fluorescent Conformational ProbeSpecific fluorescent labeling of the JFP moiety of the triad was performed using the cleavable hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagent, sulfosuccinimidyl 3-((2-(7-azido-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)ethyl)dithio)propionate (SAED; (16Kang J.J.

First, neomycin-SAED conjugates were formed by incubating 0.4 mM neomycin with 0.2 mM SAED in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) for 15 min at 22° in the dark. The reaction was quenched by a 10-fold dilution with 10 mM lysine. Fifty μl of neomycin-SAED conjugate (final neomycin concentration was 2 μM) were mixed in the dark with 1 mg of triad protein, brought to 1 ml with PI buffer, and centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g. The sedimented fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of PI buffer and photolyzed with UV light in a Pyrex tube at 4°C for 10 min. β-Mercaptoethanol was added (100 mM final) to cleave the disulfide bond of SAED. After incubation on ice for 1 h, the mixture was again centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g, and the sedimented triads were resuspended in 50 μl of PI buffer to a final protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. The MCA incorporation was also done using polylysine as a site-directing carrier as described previously(16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous report, these procedures (both neomycin- and polylysine-mediated incorporation) resulted in the specific incorporation of the MCA into the JFP moiety of the triad as determined by fluorometry of electrophoretically separated protein bands (data not shown).Induction and Monitoring of Depolarization-induced Ca2+ ReleaseTo depolarize the T-tubule moiety of the triad, we used the Na+-replacement protocol that had been originally used to produce T-tubule-mediated tension development in the skinned fiber system (21Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 495-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Lamb G.D. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 519-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and more recently adapted to the isolated triad system(17Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fluorescently labeled triads (1.6 mg/ml) were incubated in the priming solution (Solution A) containing 150 mM potassium gluconate, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg•ATP, an ATP-regenerating system (2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase), 100-150 μM CaCl2, 20 mM imidazole (pH 6.8) at 22°C for 6 min or longer. Then, 15 μl of Solution A was mixed with 135 μl of Solution B containing various concentrations of potassium gluconate, sodium gluconate, 15 mM NaCl, 2.5 μM fluo-3, 20 mM imidazole (pH 6.8). Major ionic compositions of the priming Solution A and the depolarizing Solution B for each degree of ionic replacement (G1, G5.5, and G10; defined in the legend to Table 1) are given in Table 1. Inhibitors, when used, were included in Solution B. The time courses of SR Ca2+ release induced at various levels of depolarization were monitored with a stopped-flow fluorometer (BioLogic SFM-3 with MOS-200 optical system) using fluo-3 as a Ca2+ probe (excitation at 437 nm, emission at 530 nm with a 510-nm cut-off filter). Approximately 30-40 traces of the fluo-3 signal were averaged for each experiment.Tabled 1Fluorescence Assays of the Protein Conformational ChangeTo monitor the time course of depolarization-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of the JFP-bound MCA probe, the fluorescently labeled triads (2.4 mg/ml) were incubated in Solution A, and 15 μl of the primed triads was mixed with 135 μl of Solution B devoid of fluo-3. The time courses of fluorescence change of the protein-bound MCA (excitation at 368 nm, emission at 440 nm using an interference filter with 70-nm bandwidth) induced by various degrees of depolarization were monitored with the same stopped-flow fluorometer. As a control, the fluorescently labeled triads were incubated in Solution A devoid of ATP (neither polarization of the T-tubule nor active Ca2+ loading of the SR), and the same mixing as above was performed. The control trace was subtracted from the traces of the polarized and depolarized sample. Approximately 70-90 traces of the MCA signal were averaged for each experiment.RESULTSWe produced various degrees of depolarization of the T-tubule moiety of the MCA-labeled triad using the previously described Na+-replacement protocol (see (17Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and “Experimental Procedures”). The time courses of (a) depolarization-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of the JFP-bound MCA probe and (b) depolarization-induced Ca2+ release from SR were monitored using stopped-flow fluorometry (Fig. 1). Although the Ca2+ release rate was slightly reduced after labeling, the voltage-dependent changes in the Ca2+ release kinetics (Fig. 1, rightpanel) show a pattern identical to that of the unlabeled triads described in our recent report(17Ikemoto N. Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, there was no Ca2+ release on dilution without ionic replacement (Fig. 1, G1). As the degree of ionic replacement and the concomitant T-tubule depolarization were increased, both the rate and the magnitude of Ca2+ release also increased. Fig. 1 also shows the corresponding time courses of the depolarization-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of the JFP-attached MCA probe (ΔF). As seen, chemical depolarization produced a rapid increase in the fluoresecence intensity. The rate constant, as well as the amplitude of ΔF, increased again in a proportional fashion to the degree of ionic replacement, suggesting that rapid conformational change of the JFP reflected by the MCA fluorescence change is a phenomenon that is tightly coupled with both T-tubule depolarization and Ca2+ release. The rate constant of ΔF is significantly higher than that of Ca2+ release at each magnitude of T-tubule depolarization (cf. Table 2 and Table 3). Based on these results we propose that the depolarization signal transmitted from the T-tubule would produce first conformational changes in the JFP as manifested in ΔF, and subsequently activation of the release channel as illustrated in the following hypothesis.

After priming the MCA-labeled triads in Solution A, the T-tubule moiety was chemically depolarized to various extents by dilution with Solution B of different compositions (cf. Table 1). Changes in the fluorescence intensity of the protein-bound MCA and Ca2+ release from the SR moiety were monitored in the stopped-flow fluorometric system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that the time scales of the left and rightpanels differ by a factor of 2. To facilitate the comparison of the kinetics of the MCA fluorescence change and Ca2+ release, the MCA fluorescence curves shown in the leftpanel are retraced in the rightpanel.

Nimodipine is one of the specific blockers of the DHP receptor/voltage sensor protein(23Bianchi C.P. Fed. Proc. 1968; 27: 126-131PubMed Google Scholar). Neomycin is another potent blocker of the T-tubule-to-SR communication, as evidenced by our recent finding that a low concentration of neomycin (0.1 μM) completely blocked Ca2+ release induced by chemical depolarization without affecting Ca2+ release induced by direct stimulation of the JFP moiety by polylysine(19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, either nimodipine (10 μM) or neomycin (0.1 μM) blocked both ΔF and SR Ca2+ release after depolarization, presumably by blocking Step 1 above. These results indicate that both the JFP conformational change and the subsequent SR Ca2+ release are under the control of the signal transmitted from the T-tubule. The results also suggest that blockage of the conformational change inevitably inhibits the subsequent release-activating step. Interestingly, 2 mM Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ release with virtually no effect on ΔF (Fig. 2). This suggests that inhibition by several mM Mg2+ of the Ca2+ channel opening (24Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 25Pessah I. Francini A.O. Scales D.J. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8643-8648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) occurs without preventing conformational change (namely in Step 2), confirming the concept that the JFP conformational change precedes the activation of SR Ca2+ release channel.Figure 2:Blockers of the dihydropyridine receptor (10 μM nimodipine) and T-tubule-to-SR communication (0.1 μM neomycine) inhibit both MCA fluorescence change and SR Ca2+ release, while SR channel blocker (2 mM Mg2+) inhibits only Ca2+ release. The primed MCA-labeled triads were chemically depolarized to maximum extent (G10) with Solution B containing various inhibitors as indicated (the concentration indicated in the text represents the final concentration of the inhibitor after mixing Solution B with Solution A). Then, the time courses of the MCA fluorescence change and SR Ca2+ release were recorded as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The reference traces represent the time courses of MCA fluorescence change (leftpanel) and Ca2+ release (right panel) obtained with no added inhibitors, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe two major events in the skeletal muscle E-C coupling are (i) sensing of the membrane potential change (depolarization) by the DHPR of the T-tubule and (ii) activation of the SR Ca2+ release channel that resides in the JFP. However, little is known about how these events are coupled. In attempt to resolve the intermediate reaction steps involved in this coupling process, we incorporated the fluorescent conformational probe MCA into the JFP moiety of isolated triads in a site-directed manner and then investigated in parallel the conformational response of the JFP to the depolarization signal and the induced Ca2+ release from SR. The main findings are as follows. (a) The protein conformational change precedes SR Ca2+ release. (b) The voltage-dependent activation pattern of Ca2+ release is an identical copy of that of protein conformational change, suggesting that the mode of regulation of SR channel is already determined by the preceding protein conformational change. (c) Blockage of the signal transmission from the T-tubule to SR by nimodipine or neomycin inhibited the protein conformational change and, in turn, Ca2+ release; this suggests that both protein conformational change and Ca2+ release are induced by the signal derived from the T-tubule. (d) Inhibition by Mg2+ of the opening of the Ca2+ release channel (24Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 25Pessah I. Francini A.O. Scales D.J. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8643-8648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had virtually no effect on the protein conformational change, suggesting that the Mg2+ block of channel opening occurred after protein conformational change. From these results, we conclude that upon stimulation of the JFP via T-tubule, the JFP undergoes a transition from a state of lower MCA fluorescence (R) to another state (∗R) of higher MCA fluorescence, which in turn is followed by a third state (∗Ro) to open the channel. ↓R→ *R⇔ *Ro REACTION 2Low concentration of neomycin (e.g. 0.1 μM) blocks only depolarization-induced Ca2+ release(19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but at higher concentrations (several micromolar) it blocks other types of Ca2+ release as well, such as release induced by polylysine(16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), caffeine(26Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6149-6154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Ca2+(26Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6149-6154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Calviello G. Chiesi M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, 0.1 μM neomycin works as a specific blocker of the signal transmission from T-tubule to SR(19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but at several micromolar it works as a channel blocker similar to Mg2+ and ruthenium red. Interestingly, no fluorescent labeling occurred when 0.1 μM neomycin was used as a carrier of SAED, and to obtain an appreciable level of specific labeling of the JFP the concentration of the carrier had to be increased to several μM, e.g. 2 μM, as done in the present study. Thus, the voltage-dependent fluorescence signal described in this study must have derived from the MCA probe attached to the channel-blocking neomycin-binding domain.As reported previously(16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the fluorescence intensity of the MCA probe incorporated into either the neomycin-binding or polylysine-binding domain of the JFP increased with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ in parallel to the activation of SR Ca2+ release. Furthermore, the JFP-specific Ca2+ release trigger polylysine induces an increase in the fluorescence of the MCA probe attached to either the neomycin or the polylysine domain, again paralleling the dose-dependent activation of SR Ca2+ release by polylysine. ( 2R. El-Hayek, M. Yano, and N. Ikemoto, unpublished data. )Together with the present finding that the kinetics of the JFP conformational change parallel the T-tubule depolarization, we propose that the conformational-switch mechanism proposed in (R →∗R) operates, as a common mechanism of channel activation, regardless of the type of Ca2+ release trigger (Ca2+, polylysine, or T-tubule depolarization).All the data shown in this paper were obtained with samples MCA-labeled at the neomycin-binding domain. According to our preliminary data, samples labeled at the polylysine-binding domain also show essentially the same voltage-dependent changes in MCA fluorescence as described here. Since neomycin and polylysine appear to bind to different domains (16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the JFP conformational change induced by these release triggers would be rather global.In conclusion, the present results suggest that the coupling between the T-tubule signal and SR Ca2+ release is mediated by a rapid conformational change of the JFP. The present study has opened a new way to resolve the intermediary reaction steps involved in the signal transmission/transduction processes. In order to further characterize the protein conformational change described here, however, several important problems remain to be investigated. These include the localization of the site of probe attachment in the primary and quaternary structures of the JFP and characterization of the structural significance of the observed fluorescence increase.

This in turn activates the Ca2+ channel in the JFP(9Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R.

The interaction between the two major proteins may be mediated by a direct contact via the cytoplasmic loop of the DHPR (12Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7507-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).According to our recent study(16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3288-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the fluorescence intensity of the conformational probe MCA, which was incorporated into the JFP moiety in a site-specific manner, showed almost perfect parallelism to the activation/inhibition profile of SR Ca2+ release by Ca2+ and ryanodine. This suggested that the JFP conformational change may play an important role in the regulation of various types of Ca2+ release. The main goal of this study is to investigate the hitherto merely hypothetical JFP conformational change during excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling by means of the MCA probe technique (16Kang J.J. Tarcsafalvi A. Carlos A.D. Fujimoto E. Shahrokh Z. Thevenin B.J.M. Shohet S.B. Ikemoto N.

Antoniu B. Morii M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10961-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we report that chemical depolarization of the T-tubule moiety of the triad produces a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity of the JFP-attached MCA probe (ΔF). The major findings are as follows. The rate of ΔF is much faster than that of Ca2+ release from the SR, indicating that the fluorescence change precedes Ca2+ release. Upon increasing the degree of ionic replacement, and thus the magnitude of T-tubule depolarization, both ΔF and the subsequent SR Ca2+ release increased in a parallel fashion. The DHP receptor antagonist nimodipine (cf. (18Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) or a novel blocker of the T-tubule-to-SR communication neomycin (19Yano M. El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Ikemoto N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) inhibited both ΔF and SR Ca2+ release. However, blocking of Ca2+ release by 2 mM Mg2+ had virtually no effect on ΔF. These results suggest that depolarization-induced SR Ca2+ release is mediated by a conformational change of the JFP, which is a prerequisite of the activation of the Ca2+ release channel."

Based on the results of a previous study (Rahmatullah, M., and Robishaw, J. D.(1994) J. Biol.

Chimeras of the γ1 and γ2 subunits were used to delineate which region is responsible.

The ability of cells to process a large number of extracellular signals into the appropriate array of intracellular responses depends on the types of signaling pathways that are expressed in the plasma membranes of these cells. The most common type of signaling pathway relies on the interaction of three kinds of proteins: receptors, heterotrimeric G proteins, ( 1The abbreviations used are: G proteinsa family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteinsGsαthe α subunit of Gs involved in stimulation of adenylylcyclaseGoαthe α subunit of GoDTTdithiothreitolLPXpolyoxyethylene 10-lauryl etherAMFaluminum, magnesium, and fluoride. )and effectors. The recent identification of more than 100 different types of receptors, more than 320 possible combinations of G protein heterotrimers, and an unknown number of effectors (1Birnbaumer L.

Given its position between the receptor and the effector, it seems likely that much of the fidelity of signal transmission must reside in the αβ γ subunit structure of the G protein. a family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins the α subunit of Gs involved in stimulation of adenylylcyclase the α subunit of Go dithiothreitol polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether aluminum, magnesium, and fluoride. While it has generally been assumed that a G protein should be defined on the basis of the α subunit, the rapidly growing number of different β and γ subunits suggests that a G protein should more properly be defined on the basis of its unique combination of αβ γ subunits. This idea is supported by antisense “knockout” studies by Kleuss et al.(3Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B.

However, since the α and the β γ subunits undergo an appreciable rate of dissociation in the course of detergent extraction and purification, it has not been possible to confirm the αβ γ composition of a particular G protein by biochemical studies. Furthermore, the tight association of the β γ subunits has not permitted the regions of the individual β and γ subunits that interact with the α subunits to be examined. In a previous paper(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we expressed the individual β and γ subunits in the baculovirus system and showed the direct association of the γ2 subunit with the α subunit of Go (αo subunit). This result suggested the possibility that selective association of the γ and α subunits might provide the mechanistic basis for the assembly of particular G protein αβ γ subunit combinations. With the recent identification of at least 10 different γ subunits ( 2We have recently identified 3 new γ subunits, bringing the total number of known γ subunits to 10 (J. D.

In the present paper, we show differential association of the γ1 and γ2 subunits with the αo subunit. Furthermore, we identify the N-terminal 15 amino acids of the γ subunit as the region responsible for conferring the specificity of association with the α subunit, using a combination of peptide and chimeric approaches. The coding regions of the β1, γ1, γ2, γ3, and γ5 cDNAs were subcloned into the pVL1392 or pVL1393 transfer vectors as previously described(8Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Proulx K.L. Biochem.

Using a combination of restriction enzyme digestion and polymerase chain reaction, the chimeric γ112 cDNA was generated by replacing the C-terminal 23 amino acid residues of the γ1 subunit with the corresponding 23 amino acid residues of the γ2 subunit, while the chimeric γ211 cDNA was produced by replacing the N-terminal 18 amino acid residues of the γ1 subunit with the corresponding 15 amino acid residues of the γ2 subunit. Following polymerase chain reaction amplification, the chimeric γ112 and γ211 cDNAs were subcloned into the pVL1392 transfer vector. Transfer of the cDNAs from this transfer vector to the wild type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genome and plaque purification of the resulting recombinant viruses were performed as previously described(8Robishaw J.D.

The Sf9 cells were grown in monolayers or spinners in TNM-FH medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 27°C. The αo subunit was purified from bovine brain as previously described by Sternweis and Robishaw(11Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αs subunit was obtained as a side product of the αo purification. Elution fractions from the C-7 column enriched in the αs subunit were pooled, concentrated on an Amicon ultrafiltration device with a PM-10 membrane, and then dialyzed for 16 h with 2 changes against buffer A (20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8), 0.1 M NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium, 10 μM AlCl3, 1 mM DTT, and 0.3% cholate). Further purification of the αs subunit on octyl-Sepharose was performed as previously described(12Sohma H. Hashimoto H. Ohguro H. Akino T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The β1 γ3 and β1 γ5 dimers were purified from the particulate fractions of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using αo affinity and hydroxyapatite chromatography as previously described(9Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ueda N. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elution fractions containing the β1 γ3 and β1 γ5 dimers were pooled and concentrated. Prior to use in ADP-ribosylation assays, the β1 γ3 and β1 γ5 dimers were dialyzed against two changes of buffer B (20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1.6 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% LPX). Approximately 68 h after infection, the cells were collected from 1-liter spinner flasks by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 10 min), rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 40 ml of buffer C (20 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride, and 1 mM benzamidine). The cells were lysed by Parr bombing at 500 p.s.i. for 45 min at 4°C and then stirred gently on an orbital shaker for 3 h at the same temperature. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min) and designated as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellets were dissolved in 40 ml of buffer C containing 1% cholate for 16 h at 4°C by stirring on an orbital shaker. Any insoluble material was discarded by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant from the last centrifugation was designated as the particulate fraction. To prepare the αo-affinity resin, approximately 30 mg of the purified αo subunit was coupled to 15 ml of ω-aminobutyl-agarose as described by Mumby et al.(13Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The resin was washed extensively with buffer D (20 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 5 μM GDP) containing 0.5% LPX prior to packing into a Pharmacia XK 16/20 column. To measure binding to the αo-affinity resin, we loaded equivalent amounts of the expressed γ subunits based on immunoblotting of cytosolic and particulate fractions with the same antibody, immunoblotting conditions, and exposures for detection. Accordingly, a 3-ml aliquot of the cytosolic and particulate fractions from γ211- and γ1-infected cells or a 1-ml aliquot from γ112-infected cells was diluted 10-fold with buffer D containing 0.05% LPX and then loaded onto the αo-affinity column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was then washed successively with 2 column volumes of buffer D containing 0.5% LPX at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min and 20 column volumes of buffer D containing 0.05% LPX at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The column was then eluted with buffer E (20 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8), 400 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM sodium, 5 μM GDP, and 30 μM AlCl3) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The AMF elution fractions containing the γ subunits were pooled, concentrated, and then measured for protein concentration using the Amido Black assay. To evaluate the importance of the N-terminal region of the γ subunit, a series of peptides made to the various regions of the γ1 and γ2 subunits were synthesized. To examine the effect of these peptides on γ2 or γ211 binding, the αo-agarose matrix was pre-equilibrated with about 1 μmol of each of these peptides. This amount of each of the peptides was estimated to be 100-fold higher than the amount of γ2 or γ211 loaded on the matrix, taking into account the possibility that the shorter sequence of the peptides might not be optimal toward adopting full conformation for binding to the αo subunit. Tryptic proteolysis assays were conducted with the αo or αs subunits in the presence or absence of the purified γ chimeras. Unless indicated otherwise, to 20 μl of assay buffer was added 10 μl of αo or αs subunits and up to 48 μl of the chimeric γ subunits (an equivalent amount of elution buffer concentrate from a mock αo-affinity column run was used as a control). The volume was brought up to 90 μl with water, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 30 min followed by room temperature incubation for 10 min. Proteolysis was initiated by addition of 10 μl of trypsin at a constant protein to trypsin ratio of 50:1 and incubation at 30°C. The final assay mix contained 35 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 mM EDTA, 5 μM GDP, and 0.1% LPX. We found that this high concentration of EDTA was necessary due to the presence of AMF in the fractions utilized in these studies. 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn at timed intervals, and reactions were terminated by adding 15 μl of 2.3 × Laemmli sample buffer (containing 23 mM benzamidine) and boiling for 5 min at 90°C. The procedure used was a modification of that described by Casey et al.(14Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To 10 μl of stock assay buffer was added 5 μl of purified αo and up to 20 μl of β γ dimers or 10 μl of chimeric γ subunits. An appropriate volume of β γ dialysis buffer or γ elution buffer was added to all samples to give equivalent concentrations of all reagents. The final concentrations of all reagents were 60 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.8 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 80 μM GDP, 80 μM NaCl, 0.04% LPX, 2 mM NaF, 6 μM AlCl3, 2 μM NAD, [32P]NAD (12,000-15,000 cpm/pmol), 0.4 mM dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and 4 μg/ml pertussis toxin. Reactions were initiated by addition of [32P]NAD and pertussis toxin and were allowed to proceed at 30°C. Aliquots of 20 μl were withdrawn at 20 and 40 min of incubation, added to 20 μl of Laemmli 2 × sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% gels, ADP-ribosylation was visualized by autoradiography of dried gels. To follow the purification of the chimeric γ subunits, the proteins in the various chromatographic fractions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting as previously described(15Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the antibody A-4 was used at a 1:500 dilution to detect γ1, γ112, and γ211. The antibodies A-10, 584, U-49, B-17, B-53, and D-10 were used at a 1:500 dilution to detect the αo, αs, β1, γ2, γ3, and γ5 subunits, respectively, as previously described (16Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9587-9590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The αo, β, and γ antibodies were detected with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment (DuPont NEN) (1 × 106 cpm/ml). The αs antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG chemiluminescent probe (Amersham Corp.). Previously, we reported that the γ2 subunit can stably interact with the αo subunit of G proteins(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction was markedly enhanced by prenylation of the γ2 subunit but was not dependent on the presence of the β subunit. This result raised the possibility that selective interaction of particular α and γ subunits may provide the mechanistic basis for the assembly of specific αβ γ combinations of the G proteins. This possibility was confirmed in the present paper by showing marked differences in the abilities of the γ1 and γ2 subunits, which are only 36% identical at the amino acid level(19Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Moomaw C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to interact with the αo subunit (Fig. 1). To try to delineate the region(s) of the γ subunit responsible for determining the selective interaction with the αo subunit, chimeras were constructed to look for “gain of function” by replacing regions of the γ1 subunit with the γ2 subunit. For the γ112 chimera, the C-terminal 23 amino acid residues of γ1 were replaced with the corresponding 23 residues of the γ2 subunit (Fig. 2). This region was chosen since previous papers (6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that prenylation of the γ subunit was shown to be necessary for stable interaction with the α subunit, suggesting a potential involvement of the C-terminal region of the γ subunit in α- γ interaction. For the γ211 chimera, the N-terminal 18 amino acid residues of γ1 were replaced with the corresponding 15 residues of the γ2 subunit. This region was selected since it was the most diverse at the amino acid level, suggesting the N-terminal region of the γ subunit as a possible site of interaction with the structurally diverse α subunits(19Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Moomaw C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To direct the expression of the chimeric and wild type γ subunits, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding either the γ1, γ112, or γ211 subunits. Approximately 68 h after infection, the cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared from these cells for analysis. The cytosolic and particulate fractions were analyzed separately since prenylated forms of the γ1, γ112, and γ211 subunits have been found in both fractions. ( 3A paper reporting the specificity and functional consequences of prenylation of the γ1 subunit expressed in the baculovirus system has been submitted for publication. )It was previously shown that only the prenylated forms of the γ subunits have the potential to interact with the α subunit(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To monitor α- γ association, the chimeric and wild type γ subunits from either the cytosolic or particulate fraction were loaded onto an αo-agarose column under conditions favoring subunit association (i.e. in the presence of GDP)(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the γ subunits were selectively eluted from the αo-agarose column under conditions favoring subunit dissociation (i.e. in the presence of AMF). To follow their binding and selective elution, an antibody raised to a peptide common to the γ1, γ112, and γ211 subunits was used (depicted by the stippledareas in Fig. 2). A consequence of utilizing the same antibody to detect both the chimeric and wild type proteins was that roughly equivalent amounts of the γ1, γ112, and γ211 subunits could be loaded, allowing their relative affinities for the αo subunit to be differentiated. The elution profiles of the cytosolic and particulate fractions from γ1-infected cells are shown in Fig. 3. Both the cytosolic and particulate forms of the γ1 subunit were detected in the flow through and 0.5% Lubrol wash fractions (lanes2 and 3) but not in the subsequent 0.05% Lubrol wash fractions (lanes4-7) or AMF elution fractions (8-18) (panelsA and B, topinsert). The elution profiles of the cytosolic and particulate fractions from γ112-infected cells were similar. Using the same immunoblotting conditions that were used for the detection of the γ1 subunit, both the cytosolic and particulate forms of the γ112 chimera were detected in the flow through and 0.5% Lubrol wash fractions (lanes2 and 3) but not in the AMF elution fractions (lanes8-18) (panelsA and B, middleinserts). However, after prolonged exposure of the autoradiogram for 5 days, we observed a low but detectable amount of the particulate form of the γ112 chimera in the AMF elution fractions (data not shown). The presence of the γ112 chimera was further confirmed by concentration of the AMF elution fractions followed by detection with antisera. The same procedure failed to detect either the cytosolic or particulate form of the γ1 subunit in the AMF elution fractions (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the γ1 subunit shows no detectable binding to the αo-agarose matrix, while the γ112 chimera shows very low binding. In contrast, the elution profiles of the cytosolic and particulate fractions from γ211 chimera-infected cells were markedly different (Fig. 3). Using the same immunoblotting conditions that were used for the detection of the γ1 and γ112 subunits, a significant portion of the cytosolic form of the γ211 chimera was stably retained on the αo-agarose matrix and specifically eluted with buffer containing AMF (panelA, bottominsert). Interestingly, elution with AMF appeared to result in the resolution of the cytosolic form of the γ211 chimera into two peaks (lanes8-9 and 13-16, respectively). Although the reason for this is not known, the two peaks may be related to the nature of the prenyl group. In support of this possibility, we showed that the cytosolic form of the γ1 subunit is modified by both farnesyl and geranylgeranyl moieties when expressed in Sf9 cells.3 Since the γ211 chimera contains the prenylation recognition sequence of the γ1 subunit, it is likely that the γ211 chimera is similarly modified by both farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups. Thus, the two peaks may represent forms of the γ211 chimera with different prenyl moieties. Likewise, a significant portion of the particulate form of the γ211 chimera was also selectively retained and specifically eluted with AMF (panelB, bottominsert). However, unlike the cytosolic form, the particulate form of the γ211 chimera was eluted in a single peak (lanes8-10). Again, this may be related to the nature of the prenyl group and/or the extent of carboxyl methylation.3 Nevertheless, it is clear from these results that replacement of the N-terminal 18 amino acids of the γ1 subunit with the corresponding 15 amino acids of the γ2 subunit is sufficient to confer the specificity of interaction with the αo-agarose matrix. To further examine the role of the N-terminal region of the γ subunit in specifying interaction with the α subunit, two peptides corresponding to different regions of the γ2 subunit were synthesized. Peptide 1 contained the sequence ASNNTASIAQARK corresponding to amino acid residues 2-14 of the γ2 subunit, while peptide 2 contained the sequence DLMAYSEAHAK corresponding to amino acid residues 35-46 of the γ2 subunit(19Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Moomaw C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following equilibration of the α0-agarose matrix with each peptide, the selective retention and AMF-dependent elution of the γ211 chimera was monitored. As shown in Fig. 4, in the presence of peptide 1, the proportion of γ211 chimera that was bound and eluted with AMF was drastically reduced (panelB). In contrast, peptide 2 corresponding to the middle region of the γ2 subunit resulted in little apparent reduction in the proportion of the γ211 chimera that was bound and selectively eluted from the column, although the pattern of elution was altered somewhat (compare panelsC and A). Peptides 1 and 2 had similiar effects on the binding of the γ2 subunit (data not shown). Taken together, the marked difference in the abilities of the peptides 1 and 2 to inhibit the interaction of the γ211 chimera and γ2 subunit with the αo-agarose matrix underscores the importance of the N-terminal region of the γ subunit for interaction with the α subunit. Interestingly, the middle region of the γ subunit has been implicated in the interaction with the β subunit (20Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22882-22886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the γ2 subunit, in the absence of the β subunit, could protect the αo subunit against tryptic cleavage(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether the γ211 and γ112 chimeras could protect the αo subunit from tryptic cleavage. Because of the presence of AMF in the purified preparations of the γ211 and γ112 chimeras, tryptic digestions were carried out in the presence of a high concentration of EDTA. As shown in Fig. 5, tryptic cleavage of the 39-kDa αo subunit (lane1) generated a 37-kDa fragment (panelA, lane2) in the absence of any γ subunit. Interestingly, the addition of the γ211 chimera was able to partially protect the αo subunit against tryptic cleavage with increasing protection observed as the γ211 to αo ratio was raised from 0.25:1 up to 2:1 (lanes3-6). On the other hand, the addition of the γ112 chimera offered little or no protection even at the highest molar ratio of 2:1 (compare lane6 of each). These results confirm the importance of the N-terminal region of the γ subunit in promoting α- γ interaction. However, it should be noted that the γ211 chimera was less effective at protecting the αo subunit than the wild type γ2 subunit. At a stoichiometry of 2:1, the wild type γ2 subunit was found to fully protect the αo subunit against tryptic proteolysis(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this difference is indicative of other regions of the γ subunit being involved in the protection of the αo subunit against trypsin or a reflection of lower affinity for the αo subunit because of the chimeric nature of γ211 remains to be established. We also decided to examine whether the addition of the γ211 chimera was equally able to protect the α subunit of Gs (αs subunit) against tryptic cleavage. As shown in panelB of Fig. 5, the αs subunit (lane1) was digested rapidly by trypsin (lane2). Moreover, even at the highest stoichiometry of γ211 to αs of 2:1 (lane6), the γ211 chimera showed no protection of the αs subunit against tryptic proteolysis. Taken together, these results eliminate the possibility of the γ subunit acting as an inhibitor of trypsin, and as such, protecting the α subunit. More importantly, these results suggest that structural differences in the α subunits as well as the γ subunits are critical in specifying their interactions. Since peptide 1 corresponding to amino acid residues 2-14 of the γ2 subunit was able to inhibit the binding of the γ211 chimera to the αo-agarose matrix (Fig. 4A), we decided to evaluate the possible effect of this peptide to protect the αo subunit against tryptic proteolysis. By way of comparison, peptide 3 corresponding to amino acid residues 2-15 of the γ1 subunit was also evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6, the αo subunit (lane1) was digested to 37- and 24- kDa fragments (lane2). Increasing concentrations of peptide 1 resulted in greater protection of the 39-kDa band and correspondingly less generation of the 37- and 24-kDa fragments (lanes3 and 4). In contrast, peptide 3 showed no protection of the 39-kDa band over the same concentration range (lanes5 and 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate a specific interaction between peptide 1 and the αo subunit. However, it should be noted that a 24:1 stoichiometry of peptide 1 to αo afforded less protection against tryptic proteolysis than a 2:1 stoichiometry of γ211 chimera to αo. The higher stoichiometry required for peptide 1 compared with γ211 chimera may reflect the involvement of other regions of the γ subunit in interaction with the α subunit. Alternatively, other regions of the γ subunit may reduce the number of possible conformations, thereby increasing the proportion of the γ subunit in the correct conformation for interaction with α subunit. The β γ dimers have been shown to support the pertussis toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of the αo subunit(14Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we decided to evaluate the ability of the γ211 and γ112 chimeras to promote ADP-ribosylation of the αo subunit. Somewhat to our surprise, the γ211 chimera was able to support ADP-ribosylation of the αo subunit (lanes8-11) though not to the extent observed with either the β1 γ3 dimer (lanes2-4) or the β1 γ5 dimer (lanes 5-7) at 15-fold lower concentrations (Fig. 7). Nevertheless, the ability of the γ211 chimera to support ADP-ribosylation of the αo subunit appeared to be real since increasing concentrations of γ211 resulted in increasing ADP-ribosylation of the αo subunit (lanes 8-11versus control in lane1). On the other hand, the γ112 chimera failed to support ADP-ribosylation of the αo subunit over the same concentration range (lanes 12-15). The existence of multiple α, β, and γ subunits, many of which are expressed in the same tissue, raises questions regarding the assembly of G proteins with distinct roles in receptor-effector coupling. Hypothetically, the assembly of particular combinations of α, β, and γ subunits might be regulated by differential expression of these subunits in various cell types and/or differential affinities of these subunits to associate with each other. If we extrapolate from previous findings on β- γ (21Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Schmidt C.J. Thomas T.C. Levine M.A. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13807-13810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α- γ (6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) interactions, it seems likely that the assembly of particular combinations of α, β, and γ subunits may be determined by their differential affinities. It further seems plausible that functional diversity of the G proteins may be conferred by the specific assembly of the more structurally diverse α and γ subunits rather than the less structurally diverse β subunits. This hypothesis was confirmed in the present study by showing striking differences in the abilities of the structurally diverse γ1 and γ2 subunits to interact with the αo subunit. In the present study, we have used chimeras of the γ1 and γ2 subunits to identify which region specifies interaction with the α subunit. Support for the importance of the N-terminal region of the γ subunit comes from our observations that 1) the γ2 subunit and the γ211 chimera bound strongly to the αo-agarose matrix, but the γ1 subunit and the γ112 chimera bound only weakly, if at all; 2) a, N-terminal peptide corresponding to amino acids 2-14 of the γ2 subunit blocked the binding of the γ2 subunit and the γ211 chimera to the αo-agarose matrix, but an internal peptide corresponding to amino acids 35-46 of the γ2 subunit had little effect on binding; 3) the γ211 chimera and the N-terminal peptide were able to partially protect the αo subunit against tryptic cleavage; and 4) the γ211 chimera was able to partially support the ADP-ribosylation of the αo subunit, but the γ112 chimera had no such effect. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the N-terminal region of the γ subunit plays the determinant role in conferring the specificity of interaction with a particular α subunit. In an earlier report(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that prenylation of the γ subunit is important for α- γ interaction. The present results extend that observation. Following expression in Sf9 insect cells, the γ2 subunit is modified exclusively by a geranylgeranyl moiety, whereas the γ1 subunit is modified by farnesyl and geranylgeranyl moieties in roughly equal proportions.3 Nevertheless, even though a significant proportion of the γ1 subunit is modified by a geranylgeranyl group, the γ1 subunit cannot interact with αo subunit within the limits of detection. Thus, the N-terminal region of the γ subunit rather than prenylation of the C-terminal region plays the primary role in determining the specificity of the α- γ interaction. However, it is possible that the nature of prenyl group may play a secondary role in determining the specificity and/or stability of the α- γ interaction. Nevertheless, it is clear from these studies (6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that both a favorable N-terminal region and a prenylated C-terminal region of the γ subunit are needed for optimal α- γ association. Interestingly, a recent study by Neer and Spring (20Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22882-22886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has implicated the middle region of the γ subunit in determining the specificity of β- γ interaction. Taken together, these results would predict a model in which the N- and C-terminal regions of the γ subunit come together to form the face for α interaction while the middle region forms the opposing face for β interaction. The results of the present study support the computer-based prediction of the N-terminal regions of both α and γ subunits as their possible sites of interaction. In this regard, a computer-based analysis of coiled coil forming probabilities has led to the hypothesis that G protein heterotrimers form via triple-stranded coiled coil interactions involving the N-terminal regions of the α, β, and γ subunits(23Lupas A.N. Lupas J.M. Stock J.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, this is the first experimental evidence to support the involvement of the N-terminal region of the γ subunit in this interaction. In a previous study(6Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that the β subunit, when expressed by itself, cannot bind to the αo-agarose matrix. Thus, the γ subunit appears to be necessary for conferring this binding. On the other hand, the highest coiled coil forming probabilities are present in the N-terminal domains of the β subunits, with the N-terminal domains of the α and γ subunits being more variable(23Lupas A.N. Lupas J.M. Stock J.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Certainly, the formation of a double-stranded coiled coil between the β and γ subunits could be further stabilized on formation of a triple-stranded coiled coil with the α subunit. Since the β γ subunits exist as a dimer in the physiological state, one possible role for the β subunit may be to confer additional stability to the heterotrimer. Another possible role for the β subunit may be to allow conformational flexibility within the β γ dimer enabling further interaction with the α subunit. For instance, the γ1 subunit cannot bind to the αo subunit. However, the γ1 subunit in association with the β1 subunit can bind to the αo subunit(9Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In future studies, we will express the chimeric γ subunits with the various β subunits and study their combined interactions with the α subunit. It is expected that such results will eventually provide the mechanistic basis for G protein heterotrimer formation.

Replacement of the TM domain with that of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insertion of 3 amino acids, and substitution of Asp for Val938 or of Ala for either Gly933 or Pro934 had no effect on internalization. Replacement of the TM domain with that of c-neu or conversion of the charged amino acids on the cytoplasmic flank to uncharged amino acids, on the other hand, resulted in a 40-60% decrease in insulin-dependent internalization rate constants. By contrast, substitution of Ala for both Gly933 and Pro934 increases lateral diffusion mobility and accelerates internalization rate. These changes in internalization were due to decreased or increased rates of redistribution of receptors from microvilli to the nonvillous cell surface. In all cases, receptor down-regulation and receptor-mediated insulin degradation paralleled the changes in internalization. Thus, the structure of the transmembrane domain of the insulin receptor and flanking amino acids are major determinants of receptor internalization, insulin degradation, and receptor down-regulation.

The insulin receptor is a member of the family of receptor tyrosine kinases and consists of two α- and two β-subunits in an α2β2-heterotetrameric form(1Kasuga M. Hedo J.A. Yamada K.M. Kahn C.R. J.

Binding of insulin to the α-subunit on the cell-surface receptor results in activation of the β-subunit kinase, which in turn phosphorylates intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), initiating the intracellular events that lead to the final biological effects of insulin(5White M.F.

In this study, we have examined the role of the transmembrane domain and flanking charged amino acids of the insulin receptor in ligand-dependent receptor internalization utilizing a series of nine mutant insulin receptors in which these domains were modified by in vitro mutagenesis. Although these mutants have normal insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity and an intact juxtamembrane region, using a combination of biochemical and morphological techniques, we find that several of these mutants exhibit decreased insulin-stimulated internalization and one exhibits accelerated internalization. Furthermore, these mutations in the transmembrane domain affect receptor down-regulation and receptor-mediated insulin degradation. Thus, the TM domain and the flanking charged amino acids provide an important determinant of ligand-dependent internalization of the insulin receptor and subsequent receptor down-regulation and ligand degradation. 125I-Insulin was prepared to a specific activity of 3000 Ci/mol at the Peptide Synthesis Core, Joslin Diabetes Center. Na125I was purchased from Amersham Corp. Fetal bovine serum and tissue culture medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. Reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington. All other reagents including lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and monensin were purchased from Sigma. Human insulin receptor-specific monoclonal antibody 83-14 directed against the α-subunit of the human insulin receptor was kindly supplied by Dr. Kenneth Siddle (Cambridge University, London) and iodinated with IODO-GEN (Pierce) when needed. cDNA sequences encoding human insulin receptors were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described previously(18Backer J.M.

Positive candidates were chosen by DNA sequencing the area of interest; selected clones were sequenced over the mutated region plus >50 bases upstream and downstream to confirm the absence of unexpected mutations. Monolayer CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cotransfected with a neomycin resistance plasmid and the mutated insulin receptor expression plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation (25Yamada K. Goncalves E. Kahn C.R. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12452-12461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and selected by growth in the presence of 450 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were enriched for expression by two or three passages of fluorescence-activated cell sorting using human insulin receptor monclonal antibody 83-14, and clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. Clones expressing equivalent receptor numbers were identified by insulin binding and Scatchard analyses(25Yamada K. Goncalves E. Kahn C.R. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

Confluent CHO cells in 24-well plates were incubated with 125I-insulin (100,000 cpm/well) in internalization medium (serum-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, and 0.3% bovine serum albumin). After incubation at 37°C for the indicated times, cells were washed with either PBS at pH 7.4 or PBS at pH 3.5 three times using a 3-min incubation for each wash. Cells were lysed in 0.1 N NaOH, 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity was counted to determine total cell-associated insulin, i.e. the counts/minutes remaining after the neutral wash, and internalized insulin, i.e. the 125I-insulin remaining after the acidic wash(13Backer J.M.

The internalization rate constant (Ke) was calculated based on the internalization data as described by Lund et al.(27Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Backer et al.(28Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. Haring E. White M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, the instantaneous velocity of ligand internalization was expressed as dLint/dt = Ke[LRs], where Lint is the amount of internalized ligand and [LRs] is the concentration of cell-surface ligand-receptor complex. Integrating both sides of the equation, Lint = Ke[LRs]dt. Thus, the Ke is the slope of the line when Lint is plotted versus [LRs] as a function of time. Integrals were approximated by the trapezoidal rule taking an interval of dt = 2 min. Fixed cells from two different experiences were dehydrated, processed for electron microscopy autoradiography, and quantitated as described previously(8Carpentier J.L. Gorden P. Amherdt M.

For each incubation time, three Epon blocks were prepared, and three sections were cut from each block. Thus, for each time point studied for each cell line, 18 separate grids were examined, out of which 1000-2000 grains were analyzed from all cells judged to be morphologically intact. Grains within a distance of 250 nm from the plasma membrane were considered associated with the cell surface, whereas grains overlying the cytoplasm and >250 nm from the plasma membrane were considered internalized. Grains associated with the plasma membrane were divided into the following classes: 1) microvilli, 2) coated pits, 3) nonvillous noncoated pits segments, and 4) uninterpretable. Grains were considered associated with microvilli or coated pits if their center was <250 nm from these surface domains; they were categorized as uninterpretable when the structures underlying the grain could not be unequivocally identified. Confluent CHO cells in 24-well plates were incubated with 125I-insulin (100,000 cpm/well) for 18 h at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with chilled PBS and quickly warmed to 37°C by addition of 0.5 ml of internalization medium to each well. At the indicated times, aliquots of medium were taken and mixed with an equal volume of 15% trichloroacetic acid to give a final trichloroacetic acid concentration of 7.5%. The intact insulin was precipitated by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was counted to determine the amount of degraded insulin. Data are expressed as the ratio of degraded insulin to that initially bound to the cells. Confluent CHO cells in 24-well plates were incubated with or without 10-7M insulin at 37°C for the indicated times in 0.5 ml of internalization medium/well. After incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with chilled PBS, pH 3.5, supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and then twice with PBS, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, to remove all surface-bound insulin. Each wash included a 3-min incubation. To quantify cell-surface insulin receptors, cells were incubated with either 0.1 ng/ml 125I-insulin and unlabeled insulin or iodinated monoclonal antibody 83-14 (200,000 cpm/well) in 0.5 ml of internalization medium/well at 4°C. After 18 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with chilled PBS, pH 7.4, and digested in 0.1 N NaOH, 0.1% SDS, and the associated radioactivity was counted in an automated γ-counter. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with insulin in the presence of 50 mM monensin, followed by cell-surface receptor quantification. The mutants used in this study include entire replacements of the TM domain by TM domains of the proto-oncoprotein c-neu (TM/c-neu) or the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (TM/PDGFR), an aspartic acid substitution for Val938 (TM-D/V) analogous to the point mutation in the neu oncoprotein, an insertion of the 3 amino acids Val-Phe-Leu between Leu940 and Phe941, double alanine substitutions for Gly933 and Pro934, single alanine substitutions for either Gly933 or Pro934, and replacements of 3 flanking charged amino acids at the intracellular face of the TM domain (Arg953-Lys954-Arg955) with the uncharged amino acids Ala-Asn-Ala with or without insertion of Arg-Lys-Arg into the exofacial surface of the TM domain (++++exo/cyt and +exo/cyt, respectively). The sequences of all of these mutant TM domains are shown in Fig. 1. CHO cells stably transfected with cDNAs for normal and mutant insulin receptors expressed between 2.5 × 105 and 3.6 × 106 binding sites/cell (Table 1). This is 20-150 times the number of endogenous hamster insulin receptors, estimated to be 1-2 × 104/cell. As described previously (25Yamada K. Goncalves E. Kahn C.R. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol.

Autophosphorylation of these TM domain mutant insulin receptors in intact cells was also normal as assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of cell extracts after insulin stimulation in vivo (Fig. 2). As a negative control, we also included the Ala1030 receptor mutant, which has an alanine for lysine substitution in the ATP-binding site and is known to be a kinase-defective mutant (19Chen W.J.

This pool of internalized bound insulin can be distinguished from the cell-surface pool by resistance to elution with an acidic wash as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time course of internalization at 37°C for all the TM domain mutants, the wild-type receptor, and the Ala1030 mutant is shown in Fig. 3A.

Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 831-839Google Scholar), the kinase-defective Ala1030 mutant showed little or no insulin-stimulated internalization over the time course of study. Among the TM domain mutants studied, TM/c-neu, +exo/cyt and ++++exo/cyt also showed reduced levels of 125I-insulin uptake when compared with the wild-type receptors. By contrast, internalization of insulin receptors was increased by 10-100% for the TM-AA/GP receptor mutant (Fig. 3A, right panel). Internalization was also studied in the CHO cells expressing normal insulin receptors and selected TM domain mutants using quantitative autoradiography at the electron microscopic level (Fig. 3B). Again, by this method, internalization was impaired for both the TM/c-neu and ++++exo/cyt mutants and increased in the TM-AA/GP mutant (Fig. 3B). Morphological and biochemical analysis also indicated that the inhibition of 125I-insulin internalization observed in TM/c-neu and ++++exo/cyt CHO cells was not as complete as that observed in cells expressing the Ala1030 insulin receptor mutant (Fig. 3, A and B). The Ke values were calculated from the acid wash data as described previously (28Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. Haring E. White M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The Ke values for TM domain mutants TM/c-neu, +exo/cyt, and ++++exo/cyt were decreased by 40-60% as compared with that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4). The Ala1030 mutant, which has abolished tyrosine kinase activation, showed the lowest level internalization rate (Ke ~ 15% of the wild-type Ke). On the other hand, the TM-AA/GP insulin receptor mutant, in which 2 naturally occurring helix-breaking amino acids (Gly933 and Pro934) were replaced with 2 helix-favoring alanines, was found to have an accelerated insulin uptake rate corresponding to ~70% above that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4, A, rightpanel, opensquares; and B). All other mutant receptors showed a normal insulin uptake rate (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Two surface steps precede the entry of insulin receptors inside the cells: the first is ligand-specific and consists of the insulin-induced redistribution of the receptor from microvilli to the nonvillous domain of the cell surface; the second is ligand-independent and common to many receptors and consists of the anchoring of receptors to clathrin-coated pits, which represent the internalization gate(16Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 831-839Google Scholar). To distinguish whether the modified rates of internalization observed with the various insulin receptor TM domain mutants were related to altered surface events, we analyzed morphologically the surface localization and redistribution of these receptors. With respect to the first step, both the TM/c-neu and ++++exo/cyt mutants exhibited defects in internalization and redistributed from microvilli to the nonvillous region of the cell surface in response to 125I-insulin binding more slowly and to a lesser extent than wild-type receptors, but faster than the Ala1030 mutant receptors (Fig. 5). By contrast, the TM-AA/GP mutant receptor, which exhibited an increased internalization rate, was more rapidly redistributed than the normal human insulin receptor (Fig. 5). With respect to the second step of internalization, the anchoring in clathrin-coated pits, the TM/c-neu and ++++exo/cyt mutants exhibited a reduced association with these surface areas when all surface-associated autoradiographic grains localizing 125I-insulin were considered (Fig. 6A). However, if we considered only labeled material present on the nonvillous cell surface, these receptor mutants showed the same propensity to associate with clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 6B). Thus, these mutants are able to anchor to clathrin-coated pits, but are not concentrated in these surface invaginations because they do not have access to the surface domain of the cell surface where these structures are located. In the case of the TM-AA/GP receptors, an increased association with clathrin-coated pits was observed whichever mode of calculation was used (Fig. 6, A and B). This suggests that the increased mobility of the TM-AA/GP receptor also increased its capacity to anchor to clathrin-coated pits. Fig. 7 shows the degradation of 125I-insulin by CHO cells expressing the four mutant receptors that exhibited decreased or accelerated insulin uptake as well as the wild-type receptor and the Ala1030 mutant. For the wild-type receptor, there was relatively little insulin degradation over the first 10 min of incubation and then an increase in rate such that 24% of the cell-associated insulin was degraded after 30 min. The TM/c-neu, +exo/cyt, and ++++exo/cyt receptors showed a reduced level of insulin degradation (ranging from 12 to 18% at 30 min), whereas the TM-AA/GP mutant had increased insulin degradation compared with the wild-type receptor (36% at 30 min). The kinase-defective Ala1030 mutant showed the lowest level of insulin degradation (11% at 30 min). Thus, the amount of degraded insulin changed in proportion to the level of insulin uptake. Preincubation of CHO cells with high concentrations of insulin (10-7M) causes a loss of cell-surface insulin receptor, i.e. down-regulation in a time-dependent manner. Fig. 8 shows a representative time course for down-regulation of 125I-insulin binding with CHO cells that overexpress wild-type insulin receptors. After 16 h of incubation, the bound/free ratio for 125I-insulin decreased by 35% as compared with that in cells incubated with buffer but without insulin for 16 h. Each mutant receptor also showed reduced surface binding of insulin after 16 h of preincubation with insulin; however, the degree of down-regulation was only 22, 18, and 15% for +exo/cyt, ++++exo/cyt, and TM/c-neu, respectively, all of which showed reduced internalization. As with other parameters, the TM-AA/GP mutant receptor showed an increased extent of down-regulation, which was ~50% greater than that of the wild-type receptor. These changes in binding were due to changes in cell-surface receptor concentration, as demonstrated by Scatchard analysis (data not shown). When assessed by insulin binding, the kinase-defective mutant receptor Ala1030 showed an unexplained, but reproducible, small increase in ligand binding following prolonged insulin pretreatment. Loss of cell-surface receptor was also estimated by changes in binding of labeled anti-receptor antibody (Fig. 9). After preincubation with 10-7M insulin for 18 h, binding of iodinated monoclonal antibody 83-14 was decreased by 30% for the wild-type receptor. The +exo/cyt, ++++exo/cyt, and TM/c-neu mutations showed reduced antibody binding by 19, 20, and 24%, respectively, whereas the TM-AA/GP mutant had a 41% decrease in antibody binding with insulin preincubation. These data confirm the fact that the loss of insulin binding is due to a loss of immunoreactive receptor protein, rather than some modification of the insulin-binding site. Furthermore, the degree of insulin-induced receptor down-regulation varied in proportion to the change in receptor internalization in each receptor mutant. In contrast to the studies with labeled insulin, however, no change in receptor was found in cells expressing the Ala1030 mutant when assessed by antibody binding. Insulin-induced receptor down-regulation is a reflection not only of receptor endocytosis, but also of synthesis, recycling, and degradation. Monensin, a calcium ionophore that inhibits receptor recycling without affecting internalization(33Carpentier J.L. Dayer J. Lang U. Silverman R. Orci L. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14190-14195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to further investigate the relationship between internalization and down-regulation of mutant insulin receptors. In this experiment, preincubation of CHO cells with 10-7M insulin for 3 h at 37°C caused receptor down-regulation by 27% for the wild-type receptor and between 6 and 39% for the various mutants (Table 2). When cells were incubated with insulin in the presence of 50 mM monensin for 3 h, in each case, loss of cell-surface receptors became even greater than that without monensin. For example, with monensin, the wild-type receptor was down-regulated by 36%. One can obtain an estimate of the “recycled fraction” by calculating the percent increase in down-regulation in the presence versus the absence of monensin, and for the wild-type receptor, this value was 28%. Based on similar calculations, the recycled fraction of internalized receptors was estimated to be between 23 and 36% for all cell lines. Thus, there was no significant difference in recycling of the internalized receptor to the cell surface among mutant and wild-type receptors, suggesting that the differences in receptor down-regulation can be accounted for mainly by the differences in internalization among these receptors.Tabled 1 Internalization of membrane receptors may play a critical role in their cellular function, as for example with the receptor for many nutrient-related components such as low density lipoprotein and transferrin, or may play a more regulatory role, as in the case of most hormone receptors. Evidence that the insulin receptor is involved in ligand-stimulated internalization has been present for over 15 years, but only recently have the structural determinants of this process begun to be elucidated. The present results clearly show the importance of the transmembrane domain of the insulin receptor in ligand-dependent receptor internalization as demonstrated by a decreased receptor internalization in the TM/c-neu mutant and an increased internalization in the TM-AA/GP mutant. Our data also indicate that the 3 positively charged amino acids on the cytoplasmic flank of the transmembrane domain are another determinant of receptor internalization since replacement of this sequence with uncharged amino acids (+exo/cyt and ++++exo/cyt mutations) results in impaired internalization. These findings could be confirmed measuring 125I-insulin internalization both biochemically and morphologically and by performing insulin degradation and insulin receptor down-regulation studies. These determinants of insulin-dependent receptor internalization are independent of receptor kinase activation or structure of the juxtamembrane region, both of which have been reported to be critical components in receptor internalization(10Russell D.S.

Regulation of internalization independent of kinase activation has also been suggested by Trischitta et al.(34Trischitta V. Wong K.Y. Brunetti A. Scalisi R. Vigneri R. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5041-5046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that insulin receptor antibodies that do not activate receptor tyrosine kinase can also induce receptor internalization, and by Androlewicz et al.(35Androlewicz M.J. Brandenburg D.F. Straus D.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9750-9757Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), who reported an insulin-resistant melanoma cell line that exhibited decreased insulin-induced receptor internalization despite normal ligand-dependent kinase activation. Along with present results, these observations indicate that the mechanisms by which ligand-dependent internalization can be regulated are complex and that the structure of the TM domain and its flanking charged amino acids are major components in the regulation of this system. The uptake of insulin-receptor complexes inside target cells is preceded by surface events that can be subdivided in three steps: 1) freeing of the receptor from microvilli, where they preferentially localize in the absence of bound ligand; 2) surface redistribution from microvilli to the nonvillous domain of the cell surface; and 3) anchoring of the receptor in clathrin-coated pits(15Carpentier J.L.

Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 831-839Google Scholar). The first of these events is ligand-specific and depends on receptor kinase activation and autophosphorylation, while the third requires specific signal sequences present in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor (15Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Gorden P. Rutter W.J. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J. Gilbert A. Orci L.

Neither of these two events seems affected by the mutations used in the present study since all TM domain receptor mutants analyzed have a normally activable kinase, intact autophosphorylation sites, and preserved juxtamembrane domains. Moreover, as demonstrated by the morphological analysis, the three TM domain receptor mutants that exhibit decreased or increased internalization can leave microvilli and show a normal propensity to associate with clathrin-coated pits on the nonvillous domain of the cell surface. This is in contrast to what has been previously observed in the case of kinase-inactive or juxtamembrane mutated receptors(15Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Gorden P. Rutter W.J. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 831-839Google Scholar). Thus, the altered surface redistribution of these three receptor mutants (TM-AA/GP, ++++exo/cyt, and TM/c-neu) most probably reflects altered surface mobility of these receptors. Indeed, using fluorescence photobleaching, the TM-AA/GP receptors have been shown to exhibit increased lateral mobility within the plane of the plasma membrane(30Goncalves E. Yama K. Thatte H.S. Backer J.M. Golan D.E. Kahn C.R. Shoelson S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5762-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that the structure of the transmembrane domain may play an important role in the interaction with the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. It is interesting to note that internalization and intracellular processing of insulin receptors are reduced in type II diabetes and obesity (36Trischitta V. Brunetti A. Chiavetta A. Benzi L. Papa V.

The fact that double alanine substitution for Gly933 and Pro934 (TM-AA/GP) exhibited an accelerated ligand-dependent internalization suggests that the native structure of the transmembrane domain does not necessarily provide the best conformation for ligand-dependent internalization. This further suggests that internalization of the insulin receptor may be regulated in some way that provides the best efficiency for transmission of the extracellular signal to intracellular receptor kinase domain. Another important finding in this study is a tight correlation between insulin-dependent receptor internalization and insulin-induced receptor down-regulation in each mutation. Internalization-defective mutations, which include TM/c-neu, +exo/cyt, and ++++exo/cyt mutants, all exhibited decreased levels of insulin receptor down-regulation and insulin degradation, whereas the TM-AA/GP mutant, which had enhanced receptor internalization, showed accelerated receptor down-regulation and increased insulin degradation. Correlations among internalization, receptor down-regulation, and insulin degradation have also been observed with chimeric receptor constructs and other mutants(48Gorden P. Carpentier J.L.

Moreover, in studies analogous to the present one, we (15Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Gorden P. Rutter W.J. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9505-9511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported similar observations in the case of various mutations of the insulin receptor accompanied by changes in receptor internalization rate and magnitude. Although insulin-induced receptor down-regulation is thought to be a complicated phenomenon that includes not only the endocytosis, but also degradation, recycling, and biosynthesis of the insulin receptors(45Carpentier J.L. Diabetologia. 1989; 32: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Carpentier J.L. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we conclude that insulin-dependent receptor internalization is the major factor in insulin-induced down-regulation and intracellular insulin degradation.

Incorporation of D-[14C]glucose into tunic slices in vitro revealed that the cells epimerize D-glucose into L-galactose during biosynthesis of the sulfated polysaccharides. The interconversion of these two sugars involves exchange of hydrogen atoms at the epimerization sites with protons of the medium. Tunic cells also synthesize trehalose, although this disaccharide is not a prominent constituent of the tissue. Pulse-chase experiments using D-[14C]glucose reveal that incorporation of label into trehalose precedes the synthesis of the sulfated L-galactan.

The major obstacle for this study is that L-galactose occurs in the presence of large amounts of the D-isomer of this sugar(15Bell D.J. Baldwin E. J. Chem.

We now investigate in detail the epimerization of D-glucose to L-galactose during the biosynthesis of the sulfated L-galactan in the ascidian tunic. Our results reveal an unexpected parallel between the biosynthesis of sulfated L-galactan and the incorporation of D-[14C]glucose into trehalose in the ascidian tissue. D-[U-14C]Glucose, D-[2-3H]glucose, D-[3-3H]glucose, D-[5-3H]glucose, and D-[6-3H]glucose were purchased from DuPont NEN, and [3H]H2O ( ™2.02 mCi/ml) was from Amersham. Chondroitin 6-sulfate from shark cartilage, Dactylium dendroidesD-galactose oxidase, porcine kidney trehalase, bakers' yeast α-D-glucosidase, almond β-D-glucosidase and twice crystallized papain (type IV) were from Sigma. 1,9-Dimethylmethylene blue was from Aldrich, and agarose (standard low Mr) was from Bio-Rad. [14C]Trehalose was prepared from D-[U-14C]glucose, using a yeast strain in which the gene that encodes for phosphoglucoisomerase has been deleted (21Stambuk B.U. Crowe J.H. Crowe L.M. Panek A.D. Araujo P.S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ascidian Styela plicata was collected in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, and transported to the laboratory immersed in sea water. Thereafter, the ascidian was cut longitudinally, the viscera were removed, and the tunic was cut transversely into slices approximately 1 mm thick. These slices were immersed immediately in the incubation medium containing 423 mM NaCl, 9 mM KCl, 9 mM Na2S04, 23 mM MgCl2, 9 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM NaHC03, and washed three times with 5 ml of this solution. Approximately 15 mg (wet weight) of the slices was incubated for different times at 20°C either with 0.7 μCi (1.05 nmol) of the 14C-labeled sugar or with 20 μCi (0.66 nmol) of the 3H-labeled sugar in 100 μl of the incubation medium. At the end of the labeling period, the medium was decanted, and the tunic slices were washed five times with 5 ml of the incubation medium. In some experiments the ascidian tissue was incubated with D-[U-14C]glucose for 6 h, then the incubation medium was removed, and a new medium without D-[U-14C]glucose was added to the tissue slices and incubated for an additional period of time. The slices were then immersed in 2 ml of acetone, where they were kept for 24 h at 4°C and then dried at 80°C for 60 min. The 14C- and 3H-labeled compounds were isolated following the method described previously for fresh tissue(2Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the dried slices ( ™2.0 mg, dry weight) were suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 30 μg of twice crystallized papain, 5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM cysteine and incubated at 60°C for 24 h. The incubation mixture was then centrifuged (2,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature), and the incubation of the pellet with papain was repeated. The clear supernatants were combined and mixed with 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. The precipitate formed after standing at −10°C for 24 h was collected by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature), dried at 80°C for 1 h, and dissolved in 100 μl of distilled water. To estimate the amount of radioactivity transferred from 14C- or 3H-labeled sugars to other molecules of the ascidian tunic, the solution described above was applied to Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper and developed in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 24 h. The origin, now free of 14C- or 3H-labeled monosaccharides, was cut out, added to 5 ml of 0.5% PPO( 1The abbreviation used is: PPO2,5-diphenyloxazole. )/toluene solution, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Throughout the text we refer to this result as “incorporated radioactivity.” 2,5-diphenyloxazole. The origin of the chromatogram described above was removed from the PPO/toluene solution, washed three times with 10 ml of acetone, and dried. Thereafter, the 14C-labeled compounds were eluted from the paper with distilled water, dried on a rotary evaporator, and dissolved in 100 μl of distilled water. The sulfated polysaccharides in the solution were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described previously(2Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of this solution was applied to an agarose gel (0.5%, w/v) and run in 0.05 M 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate buffer (pH 9.0) for 1 h at 120 V. The sulfated polysaccharides in the gel were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide in water and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v). After staining, the gel was washed for about 15 min in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v). The 14C-labeled polysaccharides were visualized by autoradiography of the stained gels. Eighty microliters of the solution of intact 14C- or 3H-labeled compounds, obtained by elution from the origin of the chromatogram (see above), were subjected to acid hydrolysis (6.0 N trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 4 h). The resulting mixture of labeled sugars was applied to Whatman No. 1 paper and separated by descending chromatography in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 48 h. The chromatogram was cut transversely into 3-mm-wide strips, which were added to 5 ml of 0.5% PPO/toluene solution and counted in a scintillation counter. A longitudinal strip showing migration of a standard solution containing 10 μg each of D-galactose, D-glucose, and D-mannose was developed with silver nitrate. Slices of ascidian tunic ( ™120 mg, wet weight) were incubated at 20°C with 3.5 μCi (5.25 nmol) of D-[U-14C]glucose in 500 μl of incubation medium (see above) for 3 or 6 h. In some experiments the ascidian tissue was incubated with D-[U-14C]glucose for 6 h, then the incubation medium was removed, and a new medium without D-[U-14C]glucose was added to the tissue slices and incubated for an additional 3 h. At the end of the pulse and chase period, the medium was decanted, and the tissue slices were washed five times with the incubation medium, then immersed in acetone, and the 14C-labeled molecules were extracted from the tissue with papain, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in distilled water, as described above. In some experiments the same methodologies were applied to ™45 mg (dry weight) of the ascidian tunic, but without the pulse with D-[U-14C]glucose to obtain large amounts of nonlabeled material. In either case the aqueous solution was applied to Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper and developed in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 24 h. The origin, now free of monosaccharides, was cut out, and the compounds were eluted with distilled water, dried in a rotary evaporator, and dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water. The above solution was applied to a column (10.0 × 1.0 cm or 1.0 × 1.0 cm) of DEAE-cellulose preequilibrated with 0.05 M pyridine/acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and developed with a gradient of NaCl, as described in the figure legends. The fractions were checked by the metachromatic assay (22Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar) and by the Dubois reaction(23Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar); the radioactivity was counted on a scintillation counter, and the NaCl concentration was estimated by conductivity. The fractions containing the sulfated polysaccharides were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. The fractions containing the nonacidic compound (see Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:) were concentrated on a rotary evaporator without previous dialysis.Figure 5:Separation of the 14C-labeled molecules extracted from the ascidian tunic by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Panels A-C, slices of ascidian tunic ( ™120 mg, wet weight) were incubated at 20°C with 3.5 μCi (5.25 nmol) of D-[U-14C]glucose in 0.5 ml of the incubation medium (see “Experimental Procedures”) for 3 (panel A) or 6 h (panel B). In panel C, the ascidian tissue was incubated with D-[U-14C]glucose for 6 h (as in panel B), but then the incubation medium was removed, and a new medium without D-[U-14C]glucose was added to the tissue slices and incubated for additional 3 h. At the end of the incubation period, the 14C-labeled molecules were extracted from the tunic slices by papain digestion, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in distilled water, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The solutions of 14C-labeled molecules were applied to Whatman 3MM chromatographic paper and developed in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 24 h. The origins, now free of 14C-labeled monosaccharides but containing the incorporated radioactivity, were cut out, and the 14C-labeled compounds were eluted with distilled water, dried in a rotary evaporator, and dissolved in 0.5 ml of distilled water. This solution was applied to a column (1 × 1 cm) of DEAE-cellulose preequilibrated with 0.05 M pyridine/acetate buffer (pH 6.0), washed with 15 ml of the same buffer, and developed with a linear gradient of NaCl, prepared by mixing 15 ml of 0.05 M pyridine/acetate buffer (pH 6.0) with 15 ml of 1.5 M NaCl in the same buffer, at a flow rate of 12 ml/h. Fractions were collected each 2 min and checked by the metachromaticity assay (○), the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (•), and the NaCl concentration(- - -) was estimated by conductivity. The fractions containing the sulfated polysaccharides (horizontal bars) were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. The fractions containing the nonacidic compound were pooled and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, without previous dialysis. Panel D shows the absolute amounts of label incorporated into the nonacidic compound (○) and into the sulfated polysaccharides (•) during the pulse-chase experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 14C-labeled nonacidic compound, which was not retained on the anion exchange column (see above), was applied to a 87.0 × 1.5-cm column of Bio-Gel P-4 (400 mesh), eluted at a flow rate of 8 ml/h with 0.05 M pyridine/acetate buffer (pH 6.0). Fractions were collected each 8 min and checked by the metachromatic assay (22Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barret A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar) and by the Dubois reaction (23Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar) and counted on a liquid scintillation counter. The V0 and Vt of the column were determined by the elution of blue dextran and cresol red, respectively. In addition, the column was calibrated using chondroitin 6-sulfate from shark cartilage (average molecular mass of 40 kDa), cellobiose, and D-glucose. The mixture of 14C-labeled sugars obtained by acid hydrolysis of the 14C-labeled compounds ( ™2,000 cpm) and a mixture of standard sugars containing 10 μg each of D-galactose, D-glucose, and D-mannose were incubated with 1 unit of D. dendroidesD-galactose oxidase (24Avigad G. Amaral D. Ascencio C. Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2736-2743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 μl of 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0). After 4 h at 37°C, the reaction mixtures were developed by descending chromatography on Whatman No. 1 paper in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 48 h, and transverse strips 3 mm wide were counted as before. In addition, a longitudinal strip from the chromatogram was developed with silver nitrate for the identification of nonlabeled standard sugars, before and after incubation with D-galactose oxidase. The 14C-labeled nonacidic compound ( ™2,000 cpm), after purification on anion exchange and gel chromatography columns (see above), was incubated with: (a) 0.2 unit of bakers' yeast α-D-glucosidase in 50 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), or (b) 0.2 unit of almond β-D-glucosidase in 50 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.8), or (c) 0.2 unit of porcine kidney trehalase in 50 μl of 20 mM potassium acetate buffer (pH 6.5). After incubation at 37°C for 4 h, the mixtures were applied to Whatman No. 1 paper and developed by descending chromatography in isobutyric acid, 1 N NH4OH (5:3, v/v) for 24 h. The chromatograms were cut transversely into 3-mm-wide strips, which were added to 5 ml of 0.5% PPO/toluene solution and counted in a scintillation counter. To assess the α-D- and β-D-glucosidase activities, the p-nitrophenol liberated from p-nitrophenyl α-D-glucopyranoside and from p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside, respectively, was quantified. The enzymes (0.2 unit) were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in 50 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0 for α-D-glucosidase and pH 6.8 for β-D-glucosidase). The reaction was terminated with 1 ml of 0.25 M glycine buffer (pH 10.0), and the absorbance was read at 540 nm. To assess trehalase activity, trehalose (50 μg) was incubated with the enzyme (0.1 unit) at 37°C for 4 h in 50 μl of 20 mM potassium acetate buffer (pH 6.5). The mixture incubated with trehalase and the appropriate control solution were applied on Whatman No. 1 paper and developed by descending chromatography in isobutyric acid, 1 N NH4OH (5:3, v/v) for 24 h. The sugars were visualized by silver nitrate staining. Upon incubation of the tunic slices with D-[U-14C]glucose the incorporation of radioactivity begins immediately and increases steadily in the first 4 h up to a plateau value (Fig. 1A). To show whether the 14C-labeled sugar was incorporated into sulfated polysaccharides, the glycans extracted from the tunic during the experiment of Fig. 1A were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). On an autoradiogram of the stained gel, the radioactive bands coincide with the two fractions of sulfated polysaccharides that have been characterized in previous studies(2Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both fractions (F-1 and F-2) are labeled. Identification of the 14C-labeled sugars in the acid hydrolysate of the ascidian polysaccharides shows a high proportion of label in the galactose residues (closed circles in Fig. 1C). The [14C]galactose is totally resistant to oxidation by D-galactose oxidase (open circles in Fig. 1C), indicating that this sugar is entirely in the L-enantiomeric form, as already observed for the nonlabeled polysaccharides(3Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Santos J.A. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Pavão M.S.G. Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1989; 189: 374-379Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The measurement of the oxidation by D-galactose oxidase included a control, which shows the total oxidation of the D-galactose standard (b in Fig. 1C). Overall, these results demonstrate that cells in the ascidian tunic incorporate D-[14C]glucose and epimerize this sugar into L-[14C]galactose during the biosynthesis of their constituent sulfated polysaccharides. Epimerization of D-glucose to L-galactose involves inversion of the configuration of carbon atoms 2, 3, and 5 of the hexosyl moieties, as shown for the β-D-glucopyranosyl and α-L-galactopyranosyl configurations. The interconversion of sugars is a relatively common reaction in carbohydrate metabolism. It can proceed as in the enzymatic conversion of UDP-D-glucose to UDP-D-galactose. The interconverting enzyme and all other such epimerases exhibit an absolute requirement for a tightly bound molecule of NAD+ or NADP+. Oxidation is followed by reduction with inversion of the configuration at the epimerization site, and a proton is exchanged with the enzyme-bound NAD+ or NADP+(25Adams E. Adv. Enzymol. 1976; 44: 69-138PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the epimerization of D-mannose to D-glucose, which involves the action of D-mannose phosphate isomerase, the hydrogen atom at carbon 2 of D-mannose is exchanged with the protons of water(26Slein M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 299-306Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism occurs in several other epimerization reactions, such as the double epimerization in the synthesis of UDP-L-rhamnose from UDP-D-glucose (27Gabriel O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1978; 3: 193-195Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or the conversion of polysaccharide-bound β-D-glucuronic acid to α-L-iduronic acid in the course of heparin or dermatan sulfate biosynthesis(28Malmstrom A. Rodén L. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Backstrom G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3878-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Prihar H.S. Campbell P. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Jensen J.W. Lindahl U. Rodén L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These two classes of sugar epimerization reactions can be distinguished experimentally. The second class of reactions is accompanied by the incorporation of 3H from 3H-labeled water into the sugar (29Prihar H.S. Campbell P. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Jensen J.W. Lindahl U. Rodén L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Barber G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 254: 7600-7603Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and by the exchange of [3H]hydrogen atoms from the epimerization sites of the hexosyl moieties with protons of the medium(31Jacobsson I. Backstrom G. Hook M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmstrom A. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the reaction involves NAD+ or NADP+-bound enzymes, these exchanges of 3H atoms will not occur. To distinguish between these two possibilities, slices of tunic were incubated with D-glucose labeled with tritium at C-2, C-3, C-5, or C-6. The [3H]hydrogen atoms at C-2, C-3, and C-5 are exchanged with protons of the medium and do not remain in the hexosyl moieties after epimerization to L-galactose (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the [3H]hydrogen atom at C-6 of D-glucose appears in the L-galactose (Fig. 2C). This result shows that the C-6 position is not inverted during the conversion of D-glucose to L-galactose. ( 2We attempted to incorporate [3H]H2O into the ascidian polysaccharides in vitro using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures” for pulse labeling of these polymers with radioactive sugars. No detectable radioactivity was incorporated. This result may reflect the dilution of [3H]H2O in the tunic slice and/or the low biosynthetic rate of the sulfated L-galactan. Incorporation of 3H from the medium has been shown in other systems but using cell-free systems and partially purified enzymes(30Barber G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 254: 7600-7603Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 32Feingold D.S. Encycl. Plant Physiol. New Ser. 1982; 13A: 37-39Google Scholar). ) These results indicate that conversion of D-glucose to L-galactose involves exchanges of hydrogen atoms at the epimerization sites with protons of the medium. When the ascidian tunic is incubated with D-[U-14C]glucose, the radioactivity incorporated in the form of D-[14C]glucose increases rapidly up to 4 h and thereafter remains constant until the end of the labeling period (Fig. 3, A-F; open circles in Fig. 3, G and H). In contrast, the amount of radioactivity that appears as L-[14C]galactose increases slowly in the first 4 h (closed circles in Fig. 3, G and H). An explanation for the experiment of Fig. 3 is that epimerization of D-glucose to L-galactose occurs after incorporation of D-glucose into the polymer, as described previously for the conversion of polysaccharide-bound β-D-glucuronic acid to α-L-iduronic acid during biosynthesis of heparin and dermatan sulfate(28Malmstrom A. Rodén L. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Backstrom G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3878-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Prihar H.S. Campbell P. Feingold D.S. Jacobsson I. Jensen J.W. Lindahl U. Rodén L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The experiment of Fig. 4 supports this possibility. When the D-[14C]glucose is removed from the incubation medium after 6 h, the content of radioactivity appearing as L-[14C]galactose increases in the absence of free D-[14C]glucose (Fig. 4, A-C, D-F, and closed circles in G). In the tunic of the ascidian S. plicata, the sulfated polysaccharides occur as three main fractions, which are markedly distinct in their molecular weight and chemical composition(2Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The high molecular weight fraction, denominated F-1, contains a high proportion of L-galactose and minor amounts of D-glucose, whereas the other two fractions, of low molecular weight, denominated F-2-A and F-2-B, contain, besides L-galactose, a higher proportion of D-glucose, amino sugars, and small amounts of mannose. Therefore, the pronounced changes in the proportions of L-[14C]galactose and D-[14C]glucose during the chase experiment (Fig. 4, A-C, D-F, and G) might reflect modification in the proportions of F-1 and F-2 fractions. However, the experiment of Fig. 4H excludes this possibility. The proportions of 14C-labeled fractions F-1 and F-2 remain constant during the chase experiment. The changes observed in the amounts of D-[14C]glucose and L-[14C]galactose units during the pulse (Fig. 3) and pulse-chase (Fig. 4) experiments might arise either from modifications in the sugar composition of a single polysaccharide or from interconversion of two types of glycoconjugates. To investigate these possibilities, the 14C-labeled compounds obtained from pulse and pulse-chase experiments were analyzed by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (Fig. 5, A-C). Two major peaks were observed. One peak was not retained in the column and probably corresponds to a nonacidic compound. The other peak was eluted at high salt concentration and coincides with a peak in metachromaticity (Fig. 5, A-C), which corresponds to the sulfated polysaccharides(2Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the amount of 14C-labeled nonacidic compound increases during the pulse period (open circles, Fig. 5D) but decreases sharply after the removal of D-[14C]glucose from the incubation medium. In contrast, the amount of 14C-labeled sulfated polysaccharides (filled circles, Fig. 5D) increases during both pulse and chase periods. The distribution of label between D-glucose and L-galactose residues in the nonacidic compound and the sulfated polysaccharides in Fig. 5(A-C) was examined following acid hydrolysis. The nonacidic compound is labeled exclusively in D-[14C]glucose residues, and the sulfated polysaccharides have a high proportion of L-[14C]galactose (Fig. 6, A-C), which is similar to the proportion of L-galactose found in the nonlabeled sulfated polysaccharides from the ascidian tunic (Fig. 6E). Therefore, it appears that the 14C-labeled sulfated polysaccharides obtained during the three experimental conditions of Fig. 5(A-C) are the “final” biosynthetic product. In addition, most of the L-[14C]galactose units of these polymers resist periodate oxidation (Fig. 6D), indicating that these residues are sulfated. In the ascidian polysaccharides, galactose exists mainly as α-L-galactopyranosides, linked glycosidically through positions 1-4 and sulfated at position 3 (3Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Pavão M.S.G. Albano R.M. Lawson A.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol.

Thus, the sulfated residues can be distinguished from the nonsulfated units by their resistance to periodate oxidation. Overall, the experiments of Figure 5:, Figure 6: demonstrate that variations in the amounts of D-[14C]glucose and L-[14C]galactose units observed during the pulse (Fig. 3) and pulse-chase (Fig. 4) experiments in fact reflect changes in the amounts of 14C-labeled nonacidic compound and 14C-labeled sulfated polysaccharides in the ascidian tunic under the different experimental conditions. The nonacidic compound was extracted from the ascidian tunic and separated from the sulfated L-galactan by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (Fig. 7A). The nonacidic compound has a high specific activity (compare filled and open circles in Fig. 7A). In fact, this compound is almost undetectable by colorimetric assays for hexose. In contrast, the sulfated L-galactan shows a low level of radioactivity per total sugar. Further purification of the nonacidic compound was carried out on a Bio-Gel P-4 column (Fig. 7B), where it eluted as a disaccharide. The purified 14C-nonacidic compound migrates as trehalose ( ™71% of the total radioactivity) on paper chromatography (Fig. 8A), releases exclusively D-[14C]glucose after acid hydrolysis (Fig. 8B), does not migrate on paper electrophoresis at pH 5.0 (Fig. 8C), resists α-D-glucosidase (Fig. 8D) and β-D-glucosidase (Fig. 8E), but is degraded by trehalase (Fig. 8F). Upon the action of this specific enzyme it releases exclusively D-[14C]glucose. Overall, these experiments demonstrate unequivocally that the nonacidic compound is mainly the disaccharide trehalose. ( 3[14C]Trehalose extracted from the ascidian tunic stays at the origin of paper chromatograms (Fig. 9, B and C). However, after purification on anion exchange and gel filtration columns (Fig. 7), the [14C]trehalose migrates on paper chromatograms together with the unlabeled standard (Fig. 8A). Our explanation for these results may be that [14C]trehalose, when first extracted from ascidian tissue by papain digestion, is bound to other molecules, which are removed during the purification procedures. )Figure 9:Attempts to isolate intermediates of the D-glucose → sulfated L-galactan metabolic route. Slices of ascidian tunic ( ™15 mg, wet weight) were incubated at 20°C with 0.7 μCi (1.05 nmol) of D-[U-14C]glucose in 100 μl of the incubation medium for 1 min (panels A and D) and 6 h (panels B and E). In panels C and F the ascidian tissue was incubated with D-[U-14C]glucose for 6 h (as in panels B and E), but then the incubation medium was removed, and a new medium without D-[U-14C]glucose was added to the tissue slices and incubated for additional 3 h. At the end of the incubation periods, the medium was decanted, and the slices were washed 10 times with the incubation medium and then incubated with twice crystallized papain (30 μg) in 100 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM cysteine, and incubated at 60°C for 24 h. The clear supernatants were applied to Whatman No. 1 paper and separated by descending chromatography in isobutyric acid, 1.0 N NH4OH (5:3, v/v) for 24 h. The chromatogram was cut transversely into 3-mm-wide strips, which were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The upper portion of panel D shows a strip of the chromatogram where a standard solution was applied, containing 20 μg each of uridine 5′-diphosphate D-glucose (1), D-glucose 6-phosphate (2), and D-glucose (3); the sugar nucleotide was localized using UV light, and the other sugars were developed with silver nitrate. In panels D-F, distribution of radioactivity in the 5-20-cm regions of the paper chromatograms in panels A-C are shown on an expanded scale (right ordinate).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Attempts to isolate intermediates of the D-glucose → sulfated L-galactan metabolic route after incubating homogenates of the ascidian tunic with D-[14C]glucose were unsuccessful(20Mourão P.A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3458-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). An alternative attempt to isolate metabolic intermediates involved papain digestion of the tissue slices after pulse and chase with D-[U-14C]glucose (Fig. 9). The 14C-labeled polysaccharide + [14C]trehalose stay at the origin of the chromatograms (Fig. 9, B and C). Products with the same mobility on paper chromatography as standard uridine 5′-diphosphate D-glucose and D-glucose 6-phosphate were identified besides D-[14C]glucose (Fig. 9E). Two other unknown products were also detected on the chromatograms (X and Y, Fig. 9, B and E). Acid hydrolysis of [14C]uridine 5′-diphosphate D-glucose, D-[14C]glucose 6-phosphate, and compounds X and Y forms exclusively D-[14C]glucose. The amounts of these compounds increase during the 6-h pulse (Fig. 9E) but decrease markedly in the chase phase (Fig. 9F). In contrast, the amounts of 14C-labeled sulfated L-galactan + [14C]trehalose increase during the pulse with D-[14C]glucose and remain constant in the chase period (Fig. 9, A-C). The absence of detectable amounts of L-galactose among the D-glucose derivatives isolated from tunic slices, together with the unequivocal evidence that this sugar appears in the ascidian polysaccharides, indicates that L-galactose intermediates, if present, are formed in minimal amounts. An alternative explanation is that epimerization occurs after incorporation of D-glucose into the polymer. In fact, galactose exists in the ascidian polysaccharides mainly as α-L-galactopyranosides, linked glycosidically through positions 1-4(3Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J.

The small amounts of glucose units occur in these polymers mostly as 4-linked, β-D-glucopyranosyl residues(3Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the positions involved in the glycosidic linkage are not inverted during the conversion of these two types of residues (see Fig. Z1). We investigated the epimerization of D-glucose to L-galactose during biosynthesis of a sulfated L-galactan in the ascidian tunic. Attempts to prepare homogenates from this tissue were unsuccessful since the tunic is rigid and composed of large amounts of fibers and amorphous substance and very few cells(33Barnes R.D. Invertebrate Zoology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1980: 1030-1032Google Scholar). Here we describe a more successful alternative using in vitro pulse labeling of tunic slices. This assay reveals that D-[14C]glucose is incorporated into the ascidian tunic (Fig. 1A) and epimerizes into L-[14C]galactose (Fig. 1C) during the biosynthesis of sulfated polysaccharides (Fig. 1B). The interconversion of these two sugars involves exchanges of hydrogen atoms at the epimerization sites with protons from the medium (Fig. 2)."

Glycosylasparaginase (glycoasparaginase, N4-(β-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-L-asparaginase (EC 3.5.1.26)) is a lysosomal enzyme that cleaves the linkage between N-acetylglucosamine and L-asparagine causing degradation of N-glycosidic glycopeptides. The structure, enzymatic characteristics, mechanism of action, and substrate specificity of human leukocyte glycosylasparaginase have been recently described(1Kaartinen V. Williams J.C. Tomich J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6855-6858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylasparaginase is encoded as an enzymatically inactive precursor polypeptide that is post-translationally processed to two subunits, 25-kDa heavy and 19-kDa light chains, which are connected by noncovalent forces(3Fisher K.J. Tollersrud O.K. Aronson Jr., N.N. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The heavy chain has 5 cysteinyl residues (Cys-61, Cys-64, Cys-69, Cys-163, and Cys-179), and the light chain has 4 (Cys-286, Cys-306, Cys-317, and Cys-345), respectively. Two single-base changes in both alleles of the glycosylasparaginase gene, resulting in the replacement of arginine by glutamine (Arg-161 → Gln) and cysteine by serine (Cys-163 → Ser) on the heavy chain of the enzyme are found in 95% of the Finnish AGU ( 1The abbreviations used are: AGUaspartylglycosaminuriaHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLC-MSelectrospray ionization mass spectrometryuatomic mass units. )patients(4Mononen I.

Aspartylglycosaminuria (McKusick 20840) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in glycosylasparaginase. It is characterized by serious psychomotor retardation and accumulation of large amounts of glycoasparagines in body fluids and tissues(8Mononen I. Fisher K.J. Kaartinen V. Aronson Jr., N.N. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AGU is the most common disorder of glycoprotein degradation and its frequency in the Finnish population (1:4000) is as high as that of the most commonly inherited lysosomal storage diseases (Tay-Sachs disease and Gaucher disease type I) among Ashkenazi Jews. In this paper we describe the localization of the disulfide bond in glycosylasparaginase, which is disrupted by the Cys-163 → Ser mutation causing the Finnish-type AGU. Glycosylasparaginase was isolated from human leukocytes and purified 4600-fold(1Kaartinen V. Williams J.C. Tomich J. Yates III, J.R. Hood L.E. Mononen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme had a specific activity of 2.2 units/mg of protein. The light (19 kDa) and heavy (25 kDa) subunits of the native 88-kDa enzyme were isolated by reversed-phase HPLC. Peptides were produced from the heavy chain by treatment of the protein overnight with α-chymotrypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.6, containing 2 M urea and 5 mM iodoacetic acid. An aliquot of the digested material was analyzed by C18 reversed-phase HPLC using a fused silica micro-column (198-μm inner diameter) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A second aliquot was removed from the digested material, reduced for 1 h with dithiothreitol, and treated with iodoacetic acid. This aliquot was then analyzed by LC-MS. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry were performed as described previously(9Griffin P.R. Coffman J.A. Hood L.E. Yates III, J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Processes. 1991; 111: 131-149Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Hunt D.F. Yates III, J.R. Shabanowitz J. Winston S. Hauer C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 84: 620-623Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer, TSQ-700, was obtained from Finnigan MAT (San Jose, CA) and equipped with an Analytica ESI source (Branford, CT). The ABI 140B dual syringe pump (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for HPLC, and a sample injector with a 5-μl loop was obtained from Rheodyne (Cotati, CA). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5-90% Solvent B (80:20 acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid) over 30 min. The flow rate from the pumps was 100 μl/min. The solvent stream was split, ~50:1-100:1, precolumn, and the final flow rate was 1-2 μl/min. Electrospray conditions were as follows: sheath gas, nitrogen at 0.2 liters/min; drying gas, heated nitrogen (80-85°C, 16 psi) 4 liters/min; needle distance to capillary, 2.5 cm; capillary voltage, −3500-4100 V. A 1-μl aliquot of sample was injected to record the molecular weight of the peptides produced by α-chymotrypsin digestion. Spectra were acquired by scanning the first mass analyzer or the second mass analyzer at a rate of 500 u/s over the range 400-1500 m/z. Sequence analysis of peptides was performed during a second HPLC analysis using tandem mass spectrometry with an equivalent amount of material. The peptide of interest was isolated by selecting the precursor ion with a 3-4-u (full width half height) wide window in the first mass analyzer and passing the ions into a collision cell filled with argon to a pressure of 3-5 millitorr. Collision energies (laboratory frame) were on the order of 20-50 eV. The fragment ions produced in the collision cell were transmitted to the second mass analyzer, which was scanned at 500 u/s over a mass range of 50 u to the molecular weight of the precursor ion to record the fragment ions. The electron multiplier setting was 200-400 V higher than used to record the ions in main beam. The second mass analyzer was tuned to give peaks which were 1.5 u wide. The amino acid sequence of human glycosylasparaginase heavy chain and the presumed cleavage sites produced by using α-chymotrypsin are shown in Fig. 1. The nonreduced protein was treated with the enzyme α-chymotrypsin in the presence of 5 mM iodoacetic acid, and the resulting mixture of peptides was analyzed by LC-MS. The total ion chromatogram is shown in Fig. 2A. An aliquot of the digested protein was reduced with dithiothreitol and S-carboxymethylated with iodoacetic acid. This mixture of peptides was analyzed by LC-MS (Fig. 2B), and an increase in the number of peptides was observed. A comparison of the m/z values of peptides expected upon treatment of the protein with α-chymotrypsin and those observed in the reduced and S-carboxymethylated mixture of peptides produced an ion that corresponds to the amino acid sequence LARNCQPNYW ((M + 2H)2+, m/z 662) containing the Cys-163 residue mutated in AGU. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of this ion confirmed the sequence assignment (Fig. 3). Calculation of the masses for all possible disulfide configurations with this peptide, and examination of the m/z values for the peptides observed in the LC-MS analysis of the nonreduced peptides, identified only one possibility. An ion of m/z 851 ((M + 2H)2+) corresponds to a peptide containing the sequences LARNCQPNYW and CGPY. This ion was not observed to an appreciable extent in the peptide mixture produced upon reduction and S-carboxymethylation. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis produced sufficient sequence information to confirm the assignment of LARNCQPNYW and CGPY as disulfide bridged peptides (Fig. 4). Thus, Cys-163 and Cys-179 are determined to be covalently bonded, and this bond is disrupted by mutation of Cys-163 → Ser in the Finnish-type AGU(4Mononen I. Heisterkamp N. Kaartinen V. Williams J.C.

The present finding demonstrates on the protein level the cause of glycosylasparaginase deficiency in over 95% of cases of the most common disorder of glycoprotein degradation, the Finnish-type aspartylglycosaminuria. The presence of another potential disulfide bond between Cys-61, Cys-64, or Cys-69 could not be resolved since the residues are located close to one another and an α-chymotryptic cleavage site doesn't exist between the residues (Fig. 1). No other commercially available enzymes were capable of cleaving the amino acid residues necessary to determine the presence of additional disulfide bonds.Figure 2:HPLC chromatogram of the heavy chain after digestion with α-chymotrypsin prior (A) and after (B) reduction and S-carboxymethylation.

Biol. Chem. 265, 10993-10999). When ATP was added in the absence of lasalocid, the fluorescence decreased by 1.7%. The addition of lasalocid quenched 71% of the fluorescence but did not reduce the ATP-induced fluorescence drop. The fluorescence drop and the EP formation were also determined in the presence of lasalocid by stopped-flow spectrometry and continuous-flow rapid quenching. The observed fluorescence drop was biphasic. The first phase coincided with the formation of EP, which was largely ADP-sensitive in this early stage of the reaction. The second phase was much slower than the first phase and coincided with the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP. When the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form was blocked by N-ethylmaleimide treatment, the second phase disappeared, and the fluorescence drop entirely coincided with the formation of ADP-sensitive EP. These findings demonstrate that the first phase of the fluorescence drop is attributed to the formation of ADP-sensitive EP, the second phase being attributed to the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form.

In the initial step of the catalytic cycle, the enzyme is activated by Ca2+ binding to the transport sites from the cytoplasmic side of the SR membrane. The γ-phosphoryl group of ATP is transferred to Asp-351 in the catalytic site of the activated enzyme (3Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H.

Concurrently, the affinity of the Ca2+-binding sites is greatly reduced, and the Ca2+ is released into the lumen. Finally, ADP-insensitive EP is hydrolyzed to liberate Pi.Tryptophans are useful intrinsic probes for detecting conformational changes in the individual steps of this catalytic cycle, because their fluorescence is sensitive to changes of the environment.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that an addition of ATP to the Ca2+-activated enzyme induces a tryptophan fluorescence drop. However, in those studies the assignment of this fluorescence drop to a specific reaction step is not definitive. Recently, we have shown (19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the tryptophan fluorescence remains unchanged when the calcium-activated enzyme-ATP complex is formed and that the ATP-induced tryptophan fluorescence drop reflects a conformational change upon formation of ADP-sensitive EP in the presence of K+, which accelerates hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP and suppresses its accumulation(20Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ transport, it is important to examine whether the tryptophan fluorescence change occurs on the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form. However, attempts to detect the tryptophan fluorescence change on this transition in the absence of K+ were unsuccessful because of the insufficient accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP.In this study, by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry and continuous-flow rapid quenching, we have determined the ATP-induced tryptophan fluorescence change and EP formation in the presence of Ca2+ and the absence of K+ with added lasalocid (a carboxylic ionophore), which was previously shown (21Kawashima T. Hara H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10993-10999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to inhibit hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP and to cause a predominant accumulation of this EP. The results show that the tryptophan fluorescence drop on the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form is revealed under these conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of SR VesiclesSR vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle and stored at −80°C as described previously (19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The content of the phosphorylation site in this preparation was 4.13 ± 0.07 nmol/mg (n = 5) when determined with [ γ-32P]ATP according to Barrabin et al.(22Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Treatment of SR Vesicles with NEMIn some experiments, the SR vesicles were treated with NEM in the presence of AMP-P(NH)P according to Kawakita et al.(23Kawakita M. Yasuoka K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The content of the phosphorylation site was unaffected by this treatment.Steady-state Measurements of Tryptophan FluorescenceThe steady-state intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence of SR vesicles was measured on a computer-interfaced spectrofluorometer as described previously(24Kubo K. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 290.0 and 338.4 nm, respectively. Slits that were 1.5 and 5.0 nm in width were set in the excitation and emission light paths.Stopped-flow Measurements of Tryptophan FluorescenceRapid kinetic measurements of the tryptophan fluorescence were made by using a stopped-flow spectrofluorometer interfaced with a personal computer which was programmed to accumulate the digitized data, as described previously(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 290 nm. The emitted light was passed through a band-pass filter UV-D36A (Toshiba) which cut off the light below 308 nm and above 410 nm in order to avoid interference from the fluorescence of lasalocid. The measurement was repeated 400-800 times, and the accumulated data were analyzed by the nonlinear least square method as described(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of EPContinuous-flow rapid quenching measurements of EP formation were made as described previously(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of the total amount of EP, the reaction was started by mixing equal volumes of solutions from two syringes, one containing SR vesicles and lasalocid in a medium and the other containing [ γ-32P]ATP in the same medium. The reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid containing carrier ATP and Pi, and the amount of EP was determined as described previously(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of the amount of ADP-insensitive EP, the reaction was started as described above, and at different times thereafter an equal volume of an ADP/EGTA mixture in the same medium as above was added from the third syringe to give 5 mM ADP and 5 mM EGTA. At 100-580 ms after this addition, the reaction was quenched by spouting the reaction mixture into a cuvette containing the trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of EP remaining was determined. ADP-sensitive EP disappeared within 100 ms after the addition of the ADP/EGTA mixture, whereas ADP-insensitive EP was not significantly decomposed because of the lasalocid-induced inhibition of hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP(21Kawashima T. Hara H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10993-10999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the reaction was long enough, the above procedures were carried out by manual pipetting.Miscellaneous MethodsProtein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lasalocid was purchased from Sigma. Other methods were as described previously(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEffects of Lasalocid and A23187 on ATP-induced Fluorescence DropThe effects of lasalocid and A23187, which are lipophilic ionophores, on the ATP-induced fluorescence change were investigated without K+ in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 and 55 μM Ca2+ (Fig. 1). When the ionophores were absent, an addition of ATP at saturating 30 μM(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) induced a fluorescence drop by 1.7% (left traces in Fig. 1, A and B). When lasalocid was added to give 50 μM, 71% of the fluorescence was quenched (center trace in Fig. 1A). This is consistent with the previously reported findings (26Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2662-2668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the tryptophan fluorescence of the SR Ca2+-ATPase is strongly quenched by lasalocid through the fluorescence energy transfer. When ATP was added in the presence of lasalocid, the fluorescence decreased by 2.0% of that obtained before the addition of lasalocid (right trace in Fig. 1A). Thus, the amplitude of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop was not reduced by the addition of lasalocid, although the total fluorescence was greatly quenched. These results indicate that tryptophans responsible for the ATP-induced fluorescence drop are not susceptible to the fluorescence energy transfer to the added lasalocid.The fluorescence was also markedly quenched by 30 μM A23187, the residual fluorescence being only 3% (center trace in Fig. 1B). However, in contrast to the results obtained with lasalocid, the ATP-induced fluorescence drop was almost completely inhibited by A23187, which was added previously (right trace in Fig. 1B). This finding is in agreement with our recent results(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were obtained in the presence of 100 mM K+ and 0.25 mM CaCl2 without added MgCl2 and EGTA under otherwise similar conditions. It should be noted that A23187 at the high concentration used in this experiment does not inhibit the formation of ADP-sensitive EP, although it inhibits the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form(27Hara H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16584-16590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the present findings indicate that tryptophans responsible for the fluorescence drop upon formation of ADP-sensitive EP are highly susceptible to the fluorescence energy transfer to the added A23187.It was previously suggested that A23187 (18Champeil P. Le Maire M. Moller J.V. Riollet S. Guillain F. Green N.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28de Foresta B. Champeil P. le Maire M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and lasalocid (26Verjovski-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2662-2668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) preferentially quench the fluorescence of tryptophans in or near the transmembrane domain of the Ca2+-ATPase by binding to the protein-lipid interface of this enzyme. It is likely that tryptophans responsible for the ATP-induced fluorescence drop are located in or near the transmembrane domain, because the ATP-induced fluorescence drop was completely inhibited by A23187 (Fig. 1B). The lack of effect of lasalocid on the ATP-induced fluorescence drop (Fig. 1A) may be due to the binding of lasalocid to a site(s) far distant from the tryptophans or due to the difference in the Förster distance (including the difference in the orientation factor) between A23187 and lasalocid.Coincidence between the Second Phase of ATP-induced Fluorescence Drop and the Accumulation of ADP-insensitive EPSR vesicles were preincubated with 50 μM lasalocid in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 and 55 μM Ca2+ without K+ and then mixed with ATP. The ATP-induced fluorescence drop (right trace of Fig. 1A) and EP formation were followed by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry and continuous-flow rapid quenching, respectively. When ATP was added to give 4 μM, it was found that the fluorescence drop was biphasic and fitted well with two exponentials (Fig. 2). ( 2Fitting two exponentials is rationalized as follows. E⋅ATP⇀k1E1P⇀k2E2P where E•ATP, E1P, and E2P denote the calcium-activated enzyme-ATP complex, ADP-sensitive EP, and ADP-insensitive EP, respectively. k1 and k2 are first-order rate constants. The fluorescence change (ΔF) at time t is represented by, ΔF=((k1⋅ΔF1-k2⋅ΔF1-k2⋅ΔF2)/(k1-k2))(1-exp(-k1t)) +(k1⋅ΔF2/(k1-k2))(1-exp(-k2t)) where ΔF1 and ΔF2 denote the differences in the fluorescence intensity between E•ATP and E1P and between E1P and E2P, respectively. When k1 ≫k2 and │k1•ΔF1 │ ≫ │k2•ΔF2 │, this equation is reduced to ΔF = ΔF1(1-exp(-k1t)) +ΔF2(1-exp(-k2t)). )The first phase of the fluorescence drop was much faster than the second phase, and the amplitude of the first phase was somewhat larger than that of the second phase. The total amount of EP increased rapidly after the addition of ATP and reached a steady-state level in about 1 s. The transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form was much slower, and the amount of ADP-insensitive EP reached a steady-state level in about 15 s (Fig. 2A). The accumulated ADP-insensitive EP amounted to 87% of the maximum of the total amount of EP. This predominant accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP is consistent with our previous observations (21Kawashima T. Hara H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10993-10999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP is selectively inhibited by lasalocid at the high concentration used in the present experiments.Figure 2:Time courses of ATP (4 μM)-induced fluorescence drop and accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP. SR vesicles (0.05 mg/ml) were preincubated with 50 μM lasalocid at 0°C for 2 h in a medium containing 10 mM MgCl2, 0.55 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA (55 μM free Ca2+), 0.1 M LiCl, and 20 mM MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0) and then mixed with 8 μM ATP in the same medium at 0°C by the stopped-flow method. The reaction was followed for 30 (A) or 3 (B) s. The ATP-induced fluorescence change (small filled circles) was obtained by subtracting the base-line level, which was determined by mixing the preincubated vesicles with the ATP-free medium. The fluorescence change was biphasic. In A, a part of the first phase was completed within the instrumental dead time. The second phase was fitted to a single exponential (middle solid line), which gave a first-order rate constant of 0.42 s-1 and an amplitude of 22.0 units on a relative scale. In B, the fluorescence change was fitted to two exponentials (middle solid line). The first exponential gave a first-order rate constant of 5.8 s-1 and an amplitude of 25.4 units, and the second exponential gave a first-order rate constant of 0.43 s-1 and an amplitude of 19.0 units. EP formation was performed with [ γ-32P]ATP by the continuous-flow rapid quenching method or by manual pipetting under conditions that were otherwise similar to those in the stopped-flow measurement, and the total amount of EP (○) and the amount of ADP-insensitive EP (•) were determined. The top solid lines in A and B show the best fit of a single exponential to the time course of EP formation, in which the first-order rate constant and the maximum of the total amount of EP were 3.5 s-1 and 2.90 nmol/mg, respectively. The bottom solid lines in A and B show the best fit of a single exponential to the time course of the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP, in which the first-order rate constant and the maximum amount of ADP-insensitive EP were 0.28 s-1 and 2.53 nmol/mg, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The first phase of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop coincided fairly well with EP formation (Fig. 2B). In this early stage of the reaction, most of the EP formed was ADP-sensitive. Thus, this finding is consistent with our previous observations (19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the ATP-induced tryptophan fluorescence drop is attributed to the formation of ADP-sensitive EP under the conditions where ADP-sensitive EP accumulates almost exclusively.The second phase of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop appeared to coincide with the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP. This probability was supported by the further experiment in which ATP was added to give 50 μM (Fig. 3). At this higher concentration of ATP, the first phase of the fluorescence drop and EP formation were very rapid and completed within the instrumental dead times. This made it possible to compare the second phase of the fluorescence drop with the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP without interference from the first phase of the fluorescence drop. The results clearly show that the second phase of the fluorescence drop coincided with the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP and was well fitted with a single exponential.Figure 3:Coincidence between the second phase of ATP (50 μM)-induced fluorescence drop and the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP. The SR vesicles preincubated with lasalocid were mixed with 100 μM ATP, under the conditions described in the legend of Fig. 2. The ATP-induced fluorescence change (small filled circles) was obtained by subtracting the base-line level as in Fig. 2. Because the first phase of the fluorescence change finished within the instrumental dead time, the data represent only the second phase of the fluorescence change. The lower solid line shows the best fit of a single exponential to the second phase of the fluorescence change, in which the first-order rate constant and the amplitude were 0.38 s-1 and 20.1 units, respectively. EP formation was performed with [ γ-32P]ATP under conditions that were otherwise similar to those in the stopped-flow measurement, and the total amount of EP (•) and the amount of ADP-insensitive EP (○) were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lack of the Second Phase of ATP-induced Fluorescence Drop and Inhibition of the Transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive Form to the ADP-insensitive Form in NEM-treated SR VesiclesIn order to obtain further evidence to show that the second phase of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop is attributed to the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form, SR vesicles were pretreated with NEM under the conditions in which this transition should be selectively blocked(23Kawakita M. Yasuoka K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ATP-induced fluorescence drop and EP formation were followed with the NEM-treated vesicles under the same conditions as described in the legend of Fig. 2(Fig. 4).Figure 4:Lack of the second phase of ATP-induced fluorescence drop and inhibition of the transition of EP from ADP-sensitive form to ADP-insensitive form in NEM-treated SR vesicles. The experiment was performed with NEM-treated SR vesicles under the conditions described in the legend of Fig. 2, and the ATP-induced fluorescence change (small filled circles), the total amount of EP (○), and the amount of ADP-insensitive EP (•) were determined. The reaction was followed for 30 (A) or 3 (B) s. The solid lines in A show spline fits. The upper solid line in B shows the best fit of a single exponential to the fluorescence change, in which the first-order rate constant and the amplitude were 5.7 s-1 and 22.7 units, respectively. The lower solid line in B shows the best fit of a single exponential to the time course of EP formation, in which the first-order rate constant and the maximum of the total amount of EP were 4.0 s-1 and 2.38 nmol/mg, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rate of EP formation was little affected, and the maximum of the total amount of EP was only slightly reduced by this treatment, whereas the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP was almost entirely suppressed. These results show that the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form was almost completely inhibited by the NEM treatment, being consistent with our previous findings(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Suzuki H. Nakamura S. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8240-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which were obtained in the absence of lasalocid under otherwise similar conditions.The ATP-induced fluorescence drop was monophasic and well fitted with a single exponential (Fig. 4B), being in sharp contrast to the biphasic fluorescence drop observed with the untreated vesicles (Fig. 2). The rate and amplitude of the fluorescence drop were essentially the same as those of the first phase of the fluorescence drop with the untreated vesicles (Fig. 2B). Thus, the ATP-induced fluorescence drop with the NEM-treated vesicles was entirely devoid of the second phase.The fluorescence drop coincided fairly well with the formation of EP, almost all of which was ADP-sensitive. This finding adds support to the preceding conclusion (Fig. 2) that the first phase of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop is attributed to the formation of ADP-sensitive EP. Furthermore, the lack of the second phase of the fluorescence drop, accompanied by the almost complete inhibition of the transition of EP, gives evidence that the second phase of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop is attributed to the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form. In harmony with this conclusion, Fernandez-Belda et al.(16Fernandez-Belda F. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9687-9698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Champeil et al.(18Champeil P. Le Maire M. Moller J.V. Riollet S. Guillain F. Green N.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest that the ATP-induced fluorescence drop predominantly monitors the transition of EP. However, because they did not determine ADP-insensitive EP, it is not known whether ADP-insensitive EP actually accumulated in those experiments.The present findings, together with our recent observations(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have revealed the experimental conditions that definitely discriminate the two phases of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop. The first phase is selectively observed in the presence of K+ and the absence of lasalocid(19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the second phase is in the absence of K+ and the presence of lasalocid at rather high ATP concentrations (Fig. 3).It appears likely that the first phase of the fluorescence drop reflects a conformational change associated with Ca2+ occlusion, which is coupled with the formation of ADP-sensitive EP, and that the second phase reflects a conformational change associated with Ca2+ release, which is coupled with the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form. The discrimination of these two phases may be useful for the detailed investigation of conformational events in these steps of the Ca2+ transport.We previously showed that conformational changes occur in the catalytic site of the cytoplasmic domain in three successive steps: formation of the Ca2+-activated enzyme-ATP complex, formation of ADP-sensitive EP, and transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form(24Kubo K. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki H. Nakamura S. Kanazawa T.

It is likely that the conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain are transmitted to the Ca2+-binding sites in the transmembrane domain only upon the latter two steps, because our recent study (19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that no change in the tryptophan fluorescence is detected upon the formation of the Ca2+-activated enzyme-ATP complex although 12 of the 13 tryptophans of this enzyme are located in or near the transmembrane domain(3Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H.

INTRODUCTIONThe SR ( 1The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumEPphosphoenzymeMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidNEMN-ethylmaleimideAMP-P(NH)Padenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate. )Ca2+-ATPase is a 110-kDa enzyme that is responsible for Ca2+ transport coupled to ATP hydrolysis(1Hasselbach W. Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ebashi S. Lipmann F. J. Cell Biol. 1962; 14: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). According to the functional domains predicted from its primary structure(3Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), this enzyme has the ATP-binding site (catalytic site) in the cytoplasmic domain and the high affinity Ca2+-binding sites (transport sites) in the transmembrane domain. In the initial step of the catalytic cycle, the enzyme is activated by Ca2+ binding to the transport sites from the cytoplasmic side of the SR membrane. The γ-phosphoryl group of ATP is transferred to Asp-351 in the catalytic site of the activated enzyme (3Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Degani C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8222-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bastide F.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 68: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This EP formation is accompanied by an occlusion of the bound Ca2+(11Takakuwa Y. Kanazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Takisawa H. Makinose M. Nature. 1981; 290: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the subsequent conformational transition, this EP is converted to the ADP-insensitive form. Concurrently, the affinity of the Ca2+-binding sites is greatly reduced, and the Ca2+ is released into the lumen. Finally, ADP-insensitive EP is hydrolyzed to liberate Pi.Tryptophans are useful intrinsic probes for detecting conformational changes in the individual steps of this catalytic cycle, because their fluorescence is sensitive to changes of the environment. In fact, Dupont and Leigh (14Dupont Y. Leigh J.B. Nature. 1978; 273: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and others (15Dupont Y. Bennett N. Pougeois R. Lacapére J.-J. Fleischer S.

However, in those studies the assignment of this fluorescence drop to a specific reaction step is not definitive. Recently, we have shown (19Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol.

Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ transport, it is important to examine whether the tryptophan fluorescence change occurs on the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form. However, attempts to detect the tryptophan fluorescence change on this transition in the absence of K+ were unsuccessful because of the insufficient accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP.In this study, by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry and continuous-flow rapid quenching, we have determined the ATP-induced tryptophan fluorescence change and EP formation in the presence of Ca2+ and the absence of K+ with added lasalocid (a carboxylic ionophore), which was previously shown (21Kawashima T. Hara H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10993-10999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to inhibit hydrolysis of ADP-insensitive EP and to cause a predominant accumulation of this EP. The results show that the tryptophan fluorescence drop on the transition of EP from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form is revealed under these conditions."

Insertion of (G)29•(C)29 in either orientation into the 5′-untranslated region of the CAT gene reduced expression in CV-1 cells 50-100 fold when compared with controls with random sequence inserts. Analysis of CAT-specific mRNA levels demonstrated that the effect was due to a reduction of CAT mRNA production rather than to post-transcriptional events. In contrast, insertion of the same insert in either orientation upstream of the promoter-enhancer or downstream of the gene stimulated gene expression 2-3-fold. These effects could be reversed by cotransfection of a competitor plasmid carrying (G)25•(C)25 sequences. The results suggest that a G•C-binding transcription factor modulates gene expression in this system and that promoter strength can be regulated by providing protein-binding sites in trans. Although constructs containing longer tracts of alternating (C-G), (T-G), or (A-T) sequences inhibited CAT expression when inserted in the 5′-untranslated region of the CAT gene, the amount of CAT mRNA was unaffected. Hence, these inhibitions must be due to post-transcriptional events, presumably at the level of translation.

These effects of microsatellite sequences on gene expression are discussed with respect to recent data on related simple repeat sequences which cause several human genetic diseases. Eukaryotic genomes contain a relatively high percentage of direct repeat sequences known as microsatellites. Simple di-, tri, or tetranucleotide repeats have been reported to be unstable and vary in length of repeat unit from one to several thousand base pairs. Recently, abnormalities of such repeats have been implicated in the genesis of a number of human genetic conditions. For example, instability of dinucleotide (CA) repeats has been observed in some human cancers(1Yee C.J. Roodi N. Verrier C.S. Parl F.F. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1641-1644PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, several neurological diseases result from an increased number of trinucleotide repeat units near or within certain genes(2Caskey C.T. Pizzuti A. Fu Y-H. Fenwick R.G. Nelson D.

Simple repeat sequences adopt several types of non-B-DNA structures under appropriate environmental conditions (negative supercoil density, ionic strength, etc). Repeating pur-pyr sequences, (G-C) or (A-C) form left-handed Z-DNA, and inverted repeats adopt cruciform structures(11Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Curr. Opin.

Simple repeat sequences of pur•pyr composition occur with high frequency in the promoters and particularly around the transcriptional signal of many eukaryotic genomes(13Mirkin S.M.

The trinucleotide (CCG)n repeat which becomes unstable in fragile X syndrome is located in the 5′-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene and is characterized as a binding site for a specific nuclear protein(32Richards R.I. Holman K. Yu S. Sutherland G.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In spite of the realization that simple repeat sequences exhibit high structural variability in vitro, relatively little is known about their properties in biological systems. Hence, we investigated the effects of the simple repeating sequences on transcription. Herein, a systematic study was conducted to understand the biological consequences of the presence of repeating sequences in the vicinity of a transcription unit on transient gene expression in monkey cells. Our data shows that (C)•(G) tracts act as modulators in cis on transcription driven by the SV40 early promoter/enhancer. Transcription is inhibited, and this inhibition can be titrated in trans with a competitor sequence. Therefore, (G)•(C)-binding proteins may act as transcriptional regulators. Constructs containing other repeating sequences, (C-G), (T-G), and (A-T), inhibited gene expression only when inserted in the 5′-untranslated region of the CAT gene in a manner that was length-dependent. RNA analyses revealed that transcription was not inhibited by these inserts and that full-length mRNA was produced. This indicates that the inhibition is due to post-transcriptional events. Table 1 shows the constructs used in this study. pRW1906 was generated by insertion of the pUC12 polylinker fragment into the unique HindIII site (site 1, 5′-untranslated region) of pSV2cat(33Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). The G•C insert was generated originally by insertion of a blunt-ended 25-bp (G)•(C) oligomer between the SmaI and the filled-in DraII site of pBluescript (+)KS (pRW1231). Subsequent isolation of a HaeIII fragment containing this insert and ligation into the SmaI site of pRW1906 resulted in a 29-bp (G)•(C) stretch flanked by two BamHI sites with the following sequence: GGATCCCCC(G)29ATCC. This plasmid is designated pRW1253. Inversion of the HindIII fragment containing the polylinker and the insert gave pRW1254. In order to study the effect of flanking sequences on CAT gene expression, a vector plasmid (pRW1293) was constructed by inserting a BglII linker into the filled-in HindIII site of pSV2cat. Insertion of the BamHI fragment containing the (G)29 sequence into this site yielded pRW1266. To move the DNA repeating blocks upstream of the SV40 promoter, a vector plasmid (pRW1292) was constructed by insertion of a BglII linker into the Tth111I site of pSV2cat (site 2, ∼400 bp upstream of the promoter/enhancer). The BamHI fragment containing the (G)29 insert was excised from pRW1253 and then placed into this site, giving rise to pRW1259 and pRW1260, which differ in the orientation of the insert. Insertion of the same BamHI fragment into BamHI site of pSV2cat (site 3, ∼ 1600 bp downstream of the promoter/enhancer) resulted in pRW1269. pRW1221 was prepared by cloning the synthetic (GGGGA)5 insert into the SmaI site of the plasmid vector pRW790. The BamHI fragment containing this insert was then excised from this plasmid, blunt- ended and inserted into Site 1 of pSV2cat to yield pRW1271 (purines in template strand) and pRW1272 (pyrimidines in template strand). The insertion of the same fragment in the Site 2 of pSV2cat resulted pRW1273. For constructs in Site 4, the BamHI fragment containing (G)29 insert was excised from pRW1253, blunt-ended and inserted into the MscI site of pSV2cat ( ∼600 bp downstream of the SV40 promoter/enhancer, within the CAT coding sequence) which resulted in pRW1931 and pRW1932, with different orientations of the insert.Tabled 1 In parallel studies, plasmids containing different lengths of other repeating DNA sequences were constructed (Table 1). Fragments containing (CG)13E(CG)9, (CG)7E(CG)7, and (CG)7 were excised from pRW1558, pRW1557, and pRW1567(34Zacharias W. Jaworski A. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. ProcNatl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7069-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), respectively, by XhoII cleavage except for (CG)7 where XhoII + EcoRI were used. (E designates the AATT in the EcoRI sites.) These fragments were blunt-ended and inserted into the filled-in HindIII site of pSV2cat (site 1) except for pRW1958, which had its insert in the SmaI site of the polylinker in pRW1906. The plasmids thus obtained were designated pRW1958, pRW1957, and pRW1925, respectively. The 48- and 32-bp alternating (pur•pyr) sequences were inserted into site 2 of pSV2cat resulting in pRW1922 and pRW1923, respectively. The insertion of the same 48- and 32-bp fragments into site 3 generated pRW1927 and pRW1928, respectively. Recombinant plasmids also were constructed which contained other repeating sequences. pRW1912 has a 98-bp BamHI fragment containing (TG)20E(CA)20 derived from pRW1151(35Blaho J.A. Larson J.E. McLean M.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14446-14455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion of this fragment into sites 2 and 3 resulted in pRW1921 and pRW1926, respectively. pRW1924 contains the 140-bp insert from the 3′ side of the mouse κ immunoglobulin gene containing a 62-bp tract of (T-G); this fragment was excised from pRW777 (36Wells R.D. Miglietta J.J. Klysik J. Larson J.E. Stirdivant S.M. Zacharias W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10166-10171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using EcoRI + HindIII. pRW1929 has a 120-bp XbaI-SspI fragment containing the (AT)10N7(AT)11 sequence. This fragment was excised from a modified pUC plasmid containing the 1.9-kilobase pair KpnI- PvuII fragment, which is the DNase I super-hypersensitive site located 53 kbp upstream of the human β-globin gene (37Ryan T. Behringer R.R. Martin N.C. Townes T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. Tim Townes of University of Alabama, Birmingham). The above fragments were blunt-ended and inserted into the site 1 of pSV2cat. All plasmids were grown in E. coli HB101 and purified twice over cesium chloride gradients. All inserts were characterized by DNA sequence analyses on both strands using the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing method(38Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was introduced into CV-1 cells by the calcium phosphate procedure(39Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. Vol. 2. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected at 60-80% confluence with 20 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm dish. At 6 h after transfection at 37°C, cells were shocked with 10% glycerol for 2 min and refed with fresh medium and further incubated for 48 h. COS-1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure with 20 μg of DNA/100-mm plate in the presence of chloroquine phosphate. The cells were shocked with 10% Me2SO and further incubated with fresh culture medium as described above. Extrachromosomal DNA was recovered from transfected COS-1 cells from Hirt supernatants (40Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar) by several cycles of treatment with proteinase K and ribonuclease A, phenol-chloroform extractions, and ethanol precipitations. High molecular weight DNA was recovered from transfected CV-1 cells (41Berger S.L. Kimmel A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 182-183Google Scholar) and purified as described above. Supercoiled or linear DNA was digested with DpnI for several hours. DpnI is a multicutting enzyme that requires methylated DNA for its substrate and thus cleaves the input plasmid DNA, but not the DNA newly replicated in a eukaryotic cell. The digested products were fractionated on agarose gels and transferred to Zeta-probe nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). The integrity of the inserts was monitored by the Southern blot analysis of the replicated DNA, using labeled linearized pSV2cat as a probe. CAT assays were conducted essentially as described by Gorman et al.(33Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were scraped into Eppendorf tubes and resuspended in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl. The cells were broken by repeated cycles of freeze-thawing, and the supernatant was analyzed for protein content. Equal amounts of extract were used in enzyme assays using 14C-labeled chloramphenicol (DuPont) and acetyl-CoA (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol) as substrates. The products of the reaction were separated by ascending thin layer chromatography and analyzed by autoradiography and liquid scintillation counting of the individual spots. The assays were normalized for transfection efficiency by analysis for expression of β-galactosidase activity by cotransfection of 10 μg/100-mm dish of the plasmid pCH110 (Clontech) which carries a β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 early promoter. Total cellular RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate total cell lysis method(42Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). RNA was analyzed by transferring to Zeta-probe nylon membrane and subsequent slot or Northern blotting. (G)29 CAT constructs were cotransfected in CV-1 cells with different amounts of a competitor plasmid (pRW1231) which contains (G)25•(C)25 in pBluescript(+) KS. The total amount of DNA transfected per 100-mm dish was brought to 20 μg by addition of pBluescript vector. CAT assays and RNA analyses were performed as described. The plasmids shown in Table 1 were designed to investigate the effects of pur•pyr tracts on transcription from the SV40 early promoter. Simple DNA sequences were placed in different positions in the expression vector pSV2cat (shown in Fig. 1), namely upstream of the promoter/enhancer region (Tth111I site) (site 2), 600 bp downstream (MscI site) (site 4), far downstream (BamHI site) (site 3), and at a site located between the promoter and the start of translation (HindIII site) (site 1). Whereas the first three positions lie outside the transcription unit, cloning into the HindIII site results in modification of the 5′-untranslated region of the CAT mRNA. Table 1 and Fig. 2 show that insertion of 50 bp of polylinker sequences into the 5′-untranslated region of the gene (pRW1906) has no detrimental effect on gene expression and, in fact, consistently yielded slightly higher enzyme activity levels than the parent plasmid pSV2cat. In contrast, the level of CAT activity for pRW1253, which contains a 29-bp G•C tract in the same context as pRW1906, is strongly reduced. If this effect was caused by mRNA secondary structure, inversion of the insert (pRW1254) should lead to normal levels of CAT expression, since the other strand is now the coding strand. Comparison of the CAT activity expressed by the two constructs containing (G)29•(C)29 sequences in different orientations showed that both produced similar low levels of enzyme. As shown in Table 1, the reduction in activity was of the order of 20-100-fold relative to pSV2cat. Since the negative effect of the (G)•(C) sequences was independent of the orientation and therefore of the transcribed DNA strand, it was likely to be caused by an event at the DNA level. To eliminate the possibility that the observed reductions are a consequence of the polylinker sequences present in addition to the pur•pyr tracts in pRW1253 and pRW1254, we also constructed a plasmid (pRW1266) in which most of the polylinker sequences surrounding the (G)29•(C)29 block were deleted (see “Experimental Procedures”). This construct was very deficient in CAT expression, even more than pRW1253 and pRW1254, indicating that the negative effect is caused by the presence of the pur•pyr tracts and not by any flanking sequences (data not shown). The effect of simple repeat DNA sequences was investigated further by studying sequence isomeric inserts. The level of CAT activity in constructs containing (C-G)48 and (C-G)32 was strongly reduced (80-90%) whereas no inhibition was observed for pRW1925 containing 14 bp of (C-G). Thus, the inhibition of gene expression depends on the length of the (C-G) insert. Additionally, constructs containing (T-G) (pRW1912) and (A-T) sequences (pRW1929) inhibited CAT expression whereas little or no inhibition was observed with pRW1924 containing the (T-G)32 insert (Table 1). The inhibition of CAT expression observed with plasmids containing these repeating sequences was not a result of deletions or rearrangements of these repeats in mammalian cells since Southern blot analyses on plasmids containing the above inserts in CV-1 and COS-1 cells confirmed the integrity of all the insert sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”). The reason why other workers (43Casasnovas J.M. Ellison M.J. Rodriguez- Campos A. Azorin F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) observed deletions of (C-G) sequences in SV40-derived constructs is unclear but may be due to the use of different systems. To further investigate if the block to gene expression was pretranslational, the RNA blot analyses shown in Fig. 3 were performed. The probes used were specific to the 5′- untranslated sequence, probe A (NcoI-HindIII fragment), and the 3′ end of the RNA, probe C (EcoRI-BamHI fragment), shown as cross-hatched regions in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows that the level of CAT mRNA made by pRW1253 is greatly reduced compared to the control plasmids. This is true with the probe hybridizing to full-length RNA and the one hybridizing to the 5′ end of the CAT gene. Similar results also were obtained with probe B (HindIII-EcoRI fragment) which covers the middle of the transcript (data not shown). These results indicate that the overall levels of transiently transcribed RNA are reduced rather than just the production of full-length RNA. This conclusion is corroborated by the same result obtained with pRW1254, which carries the insert in the opposite orientation. In contrast, full-length RNA was made with constructs containing 48-, 32-, and 14-bp alternating (C-G) sequences (pRW1958, pRW1957, and pRW1925, respectively) as revealed by RNA analysis using probe C, which hybridizes to the 5′ end of the CAT gene (Fig. 3). The amount of mRNA made from these constructs was approximately equal to or greater than that made from pSV2cat or pRW1906. Similar results also were obtained with plasmids containing (T-G) and (A-T) inserts (data not shown). In these cases, it is clear that the block to gene expression does not lie at the DNA level, but rather is post-transcriptional, presumably at the level of translation. Since some of the simple pur•pyr sequences appeared to down-regulate promoter activity rather than block transcription elongation, the inserts were moved outside of the transcription unit. Table 1 shows that when the (G)29 tract was inserted in site 2, approximately 400 bp upstream of the transcription start site (pRW1259), gene expression was higher than that in pSV2cat or a control plasmid pRW1292 which carries a BglII linker instead of the pur•pyr sequences in the same position. The effect was again orientation independent, as demonstrated by the orientation isomer pRW1260. However, the increase in CAT activity (compared to the parent plasmid pSV2cat) was only 2-3-fold and could only be observed with plasmids containing the SV40 72-bp enhancers. No stimulation of gene expression above the basal level could be observed (data not shown) with constructs derived from the parent plasmids pA10cat2 and pCAT promoter (Promega), which lack the enhancer sequences. The up-modulation of gene expression was largely independent of the distance of the (G)29 inserts from the transcription start site, since constructs with inserts in site 3, downstream of the CAT gene (pRW1269) showed the same level of expression as those in site 2, (pRW1259 and pRW1260). This is further corroborated by the results obtained with (G)29 insert into site 4. Since the insertion of (G)29 and (C)29 at site 4 lies within the coding sequence of the CAT gene and causes no expression of the gene, RNA analyses were performed on these constructs. Full-length mRNA was made by pRW1931 as revealed by Northern blot analysis (not shown) which again was independent of the orientation of the insert as demonstrated by the orientation isomer pRW1932. The amounts of RNA made by the constructs at site 4 were similar to those in sites 2 and 3. The level of the CAT activity observed in constructs containing 48- and 32-bp repeating (C-G) inserts in site 2 (pRW1922 and pRW1923, respectively) and site 3 (pRW1927 and pRW1928, respectively) was similar to the parental plasmid, pSV2cat or pRW1292. Similar results were obtained with pRW1921 and 1926 containing repeating (T-G)20 inserts at site 2 and 3, respectively. Furthermore, when these sequences were inserted into pA10cat2, no stimulation of CAT expression was observed. Our results clearly indicate that the alternating (C-G) and (T-G) sequences do not enhance transcription of the CAT gene in the enhancerless constructs (pA10cat2 derivatives), in disagreement with a previous report (44Howard H. Seidman M. Howard B.H. Gorman C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2622-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and likewise do not have any effect on transcription from the wild-type SV40 promoter. A possible reason for the observed inhibition of CAT gene expression is the binding of a transcription factor to the (G)•(C) sequences. To investigate this possibility, we first examined gene expression in pSV2cat which carried (GGGGA)5 inserts. As shown in Table 1, these inserts (pRW1271, pRW1272, and pRW1273) had little effect on CAT expression, indicating that the modest interruption of the run of Gs is detrimental to the observed inhibitions. This result also argues against the possibility that the modulation of gene expression is due to cleavage of the pur•pyr sequences by a member of the family of nuclear endonucleases with specificity for (G)•(C) tracts(45Ruiz-Carrillo A.

INTRODUCTIONVibrio cholerae, a non-invasive Gram-negative bacterium is the etiological agent of cholera, a severe diarrheal disease. The bacterium adheres to the epithelial cells of the proximal small intestine and secretes a potent enterotoxin which can cause acidosis and death. The outer membrane of enteropathogens is one of the several factors involved in the interaction between the bacterium and the epithelial surface and in conferring resistance to bile salts as well as to host defense factors such as lysozyme and leukocyte proteins (Nikaido and Vaara, 1985).In the course of our studies on the cell surface of a hypertoxinogenic strain 569B of V. cholerae for a better understanding of the host-bacterium interactions, several atypical features of the cell surface emerged. These cells are highly sensitive to a wide range of chemicals, particularly hydrophobic compounds and neutral and anionic detergents. This is partly because of the presence of phospholipids in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (Paul et al., 1992). Normally Gram-negative bacteria with smooth type lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( 1The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1-ANS1-Anilino 8-naphthalene sulfonic acid, sodium saltRP-HPLCreverse phase-high performance liquid chromatographykbkilobase(s). )in the outer membrane are resistant to hydrophobic compounds and detergents and do not have phospholipids exposed on the surface, thereby restricting the entry of non-polar molecules by diffusion (Sukupolvi and Vaara, 1989). The LPS of V. cholerae contained O-antigenic sugars and has less negative charge compared to those in other organisms (Paul et al., 1992).The interaction of V. cholerae cells with β-lactam antibiotics, which inhibit the final step of murein biosynthesis, has recently been examined primarily for two reasons. First, although β-lactam antibiotics have, so far, not been used as a protective drug for cholera, there are a number of reports describing that these antibiotics can preferentially inhibit the adherence of enteropathogens by disorganizing the membrane-associated machinery responsible for fimbrial attachment (Sugarman and Donta, 1979; Hales and Ames, 1985; Schifferli and Beachey, 1988). It would be intriguing to examine whether the β-lactam group of antibiotics can be effectively used as a drug that will exert control over the spread of infection in the intestine. Second, the murein network of V. cholerae is weak, and the cells lyse rapidly in hypotonic medium as well as in the presence of chelating agents such as Tris and EDTA (Lohia et al., 1984, 1985). Purified outer membrane can be directly isolated from whole cells by treatment with protein denaturants such as urea at room temperature (Lohia et al., 1984). Unlike other Gram-negative organisms, V. cholerae cells are equally sensitive to penicillin and ampicillin and in general more susceptible than Escherichia coli to most of the β-lactam antibiotics (Sengupta et al., 1992). Prolonged treatment with β-lactam antibiotics produced cells resistant to these antibiotics (Sengupta et al., 1992), and this represents an example of adaptive mutation (Cairns et al., 1988). It has been reported that except in the relative proportion of some low molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins, the penicillin-binding protein profiles of β-lactam-resistant and wild type cells were identical (Sengupta et al., 1990; 1992). Cells resistant to a β-lactam antibiotic exhibited broad cross-resistance to other β-lactam antibiotics. A new 12-kDa outer membrane protein was detected in SDS-PAGE from both β-lactam-resistant cells and wild type cells grown in presence of β-lactam antibiotics (Sengupta et al., 1992). The protein constituted about 8-10% of the total outer membrane proteins of β-lactam-resistant cells. Since the β-lactam-induced protein was found to be associated with every type of β-lactam resistant mutant of V. cholerae, studies were undertaken to investigate its role in conferring β-lactam resistance. The protein has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. Results presented here suggest that the β-lactam-induced protein, a homodimer of 12-kDa monomers, might block the porin OmpF through which β-lactam antibiotics normally enter the cell.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials1-Anilino 8-naphthalene sulfonic acid, sodium salt (1-ANS), dansyl chloride, Tris, HCl, LiCl, all electrophoretic reagents, standard proteins, DNase, and RNase were purchased from Sigma. Sarkosyl NL97 was purchased from Geigy Industrial Chemicals. Radiochemicals used were either from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, India or from Amersham Inc. HPLC buffers were degassed and purged with nitrogen to prevent oxidation of proteins particularly at high or low pH.Bacterial Strains and Growth ConditionsThe hypertoxinogenic strain 569B of V. cholerae (biotype, classical; serotype, Inaba) which carries a streptomycin resistance marker (50 μg/ml) was used in this study. Cells were grown in a gyratory shaker at 37°C in nutrient broth (NB) containing 0.18 M NaCl at pH 8.0 and maintained as described previously (Roy et al., 1982). The E. coli strains C-600, K-12, and DH-5α were grown in LB at pH 7.4. Cell viability was assayed as colony forming units on nutrient agar plates, and growth was assayed by measuring absorbance at 585 nm (A585). 8 × 108 colony forming units/ml corresponded to A585 of 1.0. The V. cholerae strains were stored at room temperature and the E. coli strains at 4°C.Preparation of Crude Cell Envelope and Other MembranesV. cholerae cells at different stages of growth were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 5 min) and suspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted in an ultrasonic disintegrator by a number of 30-s pulses at 55 watts until the cell suspension became translucent. The cell lysate was treated with DNase and RNase (100 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37°C, and the unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation. The cell lysate was centrifuged in a Beckman Ti50 rotor for 30 min at 105,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, the pellet constituting the crude cell envelope was washed with cold phosphate buffer, suspended in the same buffer, and kept at −20°C.The outer membrane along with the associated peptidoglycan layer was isolated from the crude cell envelope by treatment with 1% (w/v) Sarkosyl NL-97 for 30 min at 25°C followed by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The inner membrane contamination in the outer membrane preparation was estimated by measuring the cytochrome b content which is located in the inner membrane. All the outer membrane preparations used had less than 5% inner membrane contamination. For extracting the β-lactam-induced protein from the outer membrane, outer membrane from β-lactam-resistant cells was suspended in 2.5 M LiCl solution in water. The suspension was briefly homogenized, centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. This was repeated twice, the supernatants were pooled, and then stored at −20°C. Prolonged storage in the presence of LiCl was avoided because this led to extraction of other outer membrane proteins.Protein PurificationThe supernatant of LiCl extract was passed through a Sephadex G-75 column (1 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing 20 mM EDTA, and 0.4 M LiCl. 0.8-ml fractions were collected, and absorbance at 280 nm of each fraction was measured and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing the 12-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE were pooled and concentrated using Centrikon-3 (Amicon Inc.) concentrator. The trace amount of high molecular mass impurities which coeluted with the 12-kDa fractions from gel filtration was removed by size exclusion HPLC using a TSK G3000 SW column (0.75 × 30 cm, Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and was precalibrated with standard gel filtration markers. The major protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 25 kDa was pooled and stored in the presence of 0.4 LiCl. To check the purity of the protein about 20 μg of the protein was analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (μ-bondapak C18, 3.9 × 300 mm; Waters), and the chromatogram was developed using a linear gradient of the solvents A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% acetonitrile) in 40 min. The RP-HPLC analysis was carried out in a HP-1090 liquid chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, model 1090A) with an integrator (model 3392A, Hewlett Packard).Protein was assayed either by the method of Markwell et al. (1978) or Lowry et al.(1951) with bovine serum albumin as standard. For some experiments, the protein was estimated using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad).ElectrophoresisSDS-PAGE was carried out following the method of Laemmli(1970) except that 10-18% gradient gels were used. For a better resolution of the OmpC- and OmpF-like proteins of V. cholerae, the method of Lugtenberg et al.(1975) was used. Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant current (15 mA/cm) and the gel stained with either 0.25% Coomassie Blue or autoradiographed for resolving radiolabeled proteins.Isoelectric FocusingIsoelectric focusing was carried out in nondenaturing slab gels of 12.5% polyacrylamide containing ampholines (pH 3.0-10.0, Pharmacia) (O'Farell, 1975). The pH gradient was calibrated using isoelectric point markers (Pharmacia). The gels were fixed (12% trichloroacetic acid, 30% methanol, and 3.5% sulfosalicylic acid) and stained by silver staining (Sammons et al., 1981; Schoenle et al., 1984).Amino Acid AnalysisFor amino acid analysis, 20 μmol of the protein was hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl at 110°C for 24 h in a sealed glass tube flushed with nitrogen with traces of phenol.Spectroscopic MethodsFor CD spectroscopy the purified 25-kDa protein in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (with or without 0.4 M LiCl) was taken in quartz cuvettes of 1-cm path length. CD spectra between 190-250 nm were recorded using a JASCO V500C spectropolarimeter at 20°C. Molar ellipticity was calculated using the equation, [ θ] = [ θ]obs/[10 {MRC}.l] where [ θ] is the molar ellipticity in degrees Cm2/dmol, [ θ]obs is ellipticity recorded by the instrument in millidegrees, MRC is the mean residue concentration of the protein and is equal to the number of amino acid residues times molar concentration of the protein and l is the path length in centimeters. The calculations for α-helix content was done according to the relation, [ θ]222 = −30,300 fH - 2340 (Chen and Yang, 1971), where [ θ]222 is molar ellipticity at 222 nm and fH (0 ≤ fH < 1) is the fraction of α-helix content.Interaction with ANS50 μg of the 25-kDa protein was treated with increasing concentrations of ANS (150-500 μM), and the interaction was monitored spectrofluorimetrically in a Hitachi F4020 spectrofluorometer with a standard 700-μl cuvette using an excitation wavelength of 375 nm. The emission spectra was obtained by scanning the wavelength from 400-600 nm. Whenever necessary, the concentration of the protein or ANS was varied. The number of binding sites were calculated from the Scatchard plot (Scatchard, 1949). The effective hydrophobicity was determined by titrating different concentrations of protein with fixed concentration of ANS and monitoring the fluorescence intensity (Kato and Nakai, 1980). The initial slope (So) of the titration curve was taken as a measure of hydrophobicity.Radioiodination0.4 ml of cells in the logarithmic phase of growth in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), containing 400 μCi of 125I (specific activity 17.0 Ci/mg) and 200 μg of freshly prepared chloramine T were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.15 ml of sodium metabisulfate (2.4 mg/ml in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5)), and residual iodide was diluted by adding 0.2 ml of KI (10 mg/ml in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5)). Cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. The outer membrane was isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Sequencing of N-terminal EndTo 2 mg of the 25-kDa protein in 0.5 ml of 0.2 M NaHCO3 (pH 9.0), 0.1 ml of dansyl chloride (10 mg/ml) in acetone was added. The reaction mixture was incubated in the dark at 37°C for 16 h, dialyzed exhaustively, and dried in vacuum. The dansyl chloride-protein complex was hydrolyzed with 1 ml of 5.7 N HCl at 105°C for 22 h. After removal of HCl, the hydrolysate was taken in a few drops of 50% pyridine and was subjected to thin layer chromatography. The standard dansylated amino acids used as markers were spotted on the same plate. The chromatography was performed using either benzene/pyridine/acetic acid (16:4: 1) or n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (30:20:6:24) solvents in the dark. The plates were dried and fluorescence was viewed under UV light. Sequencing was done in an automated amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystem, model 473A).Biological AssaysThe β-lactamase activity was assayed iodometrically (Tai et al., 1985). Under the conditions used, the limit of detection was 0.1 unit of the enzyme/ml. The autolytic activity was assayed using the method of Prestidge and Pardee (1957) using Bacillus megaterium protoplasts. The protoplasts were stable for 1 h.The penicillin-binding property of the protein was examined by suspending 150 μg of cell envelope in 50 μl of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 125I-PenX as described previously (Sengupta et al., 1990). The membrane suspension was incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The labeling was terminated by adding 1% (w/v) Sarkosyl NL-97 and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Liposome Swelling AssayThis was carried out following the method of Nikaido et al.(1991). To prepare liposomes or proteoliposomes, 2 ml of benzene was added to 2.4 μmol of acetone-washed egg phosphatidylcholine and 0.2 μmol of diacetyl phosphate and dried under a stream of nitrogen. To the dried sample 2 ml of diethyl ether was added and dried in nitrogen atmosphere. The dried sample was suspended either in water or in the solution of desired protein in water. The sample was dried and finally suspended in 0.6 ml of 17% (w/v) dextran T-40 in 5 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5).RESULTSβ-Lactam-induced ProteinThe 12-kDa outer membrane protein detected in SDS-PAGE following treatment of V. cholerae cells with β-lactam antibiotics can be selectively extracted by treatment of whole cells or isolated outer membrane with LiCl (Sengupta et al., 1992). Taking advantage of this observation, the protein was purified to homogeneity. Gel filtration through Sephadex G-75 of the LiCl extract of the outer membrane of β-lactam resistant mutant of V. cholerae revealed three protein fractions (Fig. 1a). Peak III contained primarily the 25-kDa protein which was resolved as a 12-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE with minor contamination of the 40-kDa outer membrane protein (Fig. 2A, lane a). The fractions 35-40 of peak III were pooled, concentrated, and analyzed by size exclusion HPLC (Fig. 1b), whereby the 40-kDa contaminant was removed. A single peak appeared (retention time = 13.52 min) whose molecular mass was estimated to be 25 kDa (Fig. 1b, upper inset). The homogeneity of the protein was confirmed by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1c) and by 10-18% gradient SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, lane b). In SDS-PAGE, the protein is resolved as a 12 kDa band indicating that the β-lactam-induced protein is a homodimer. The Stoke's radius of the protein was found to be 26 Å (Fig. 1b, lower inset) with frictional coefficient (f/fo) equal to 1 suggesting that the protein is spherical in nature. The possibility of any glycosylic linkages in the 25-kDa protein was eliminated using periodic acid Schiff's base staining (Zacharius et al., 1969). The isoelectric point of the 25-kDa protein was 8.5, and the gels showed a single band confirming the purity of the protein (data not shown). In contrast to majority of the outer membrane proteins which are acidic in nature, the 25-kDa protein is basic.Figure 2:SDS-PAGE of the 25-kDa protein at different stages of purification.

No sulfur-containing amino acid could be detected. The distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids is comparable. The number of acidic amino acid residues in the 25-kDa protein is 13 which exceeds the number of basic amino acid residues. Considering that the pI of the protein is 8.5, it is possible that the majority of the aspartic and glutamic acids are present in the amide form.Tabled 1The CD spectra of the 25-kDa protein was monitored in the far UV region (190-250 nm) in presence and absence of 0.4 M LiCl. In absence of salt (Fig. 3A), the spectra showed maximum ellipticity at 218 nm characteristic of proteins having significant amounts of β-sheeted structure. The α-helix content of the 25-kDa protein was estimated to be 6-7%. In the presence of 0.4 M LiCl, the β-sheeted structure is destroyed, and the protein assumes largely random coil conformation (Fig. 3B). The transition is reversible. The β-sheeted structure of the protein is restored upon removal of the salt.Figure 3:CD spectra of the 25-kDa protein. A, the protein (50 μg/ml) in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was scanned in the far UV region (190-250 nm) at 20°C. B, spectrum under identical conditions except that the buffer contained 0.4 M LiCl. Spectra presented are after base-line correction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the minimum concentration of LiCl at which the protein remains in soluble form, the protein was kept at 25°C for 16 h in the presence of different concentrations of LiCl, centrifuged, and the supernatants were analyzed by size exclusion HPLC and SDS-PAGE. At LiCl concentrations below 0.4 M, the protein remained in the soluble form only for a short time after which it formed aggregates. The net amount of the protein was reduced upon prolonged storage. There was, however, no proteolytic degradation during holding indicating that the purified protein is free from proteases.Interactions Involved in Dimer FormationTo investigate whether the dimers of 12-kDa monomeric units of the 25-kDa protein are formed by covalent linkages, the 25-kDa protein was analyzed in SDS-PAGE in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer. In both the cases, only the 12-kDa protein could be resolved in the gel with no trace of the 25-kDa protein. This observation excludes the possibility of -S-S- linkages between the two monomers to form the dimer.Size-exclusion HPLC in buffers ranging from pH 3 to 8.8 containing different concentrations of NaCl or KCl (0.5-2.0 M used) failed to dissociate the dimer. Hence, either the solvent protein interaction or the changes in the electrostatic interactions between the subunits failed to monomerize the protein ruling out electrostatic interaction as the major force involved in dimerization.Using ANS as extrinsic fluorescent probe, the hydrophobicity of the 25-kDa protein was estimated. Compared to the weak emission in aqueous solution, about 9-10-fold increase in fluorescence intensity was observed when the ANS-25-kDa complex was examined at 520 nm ( λex, 375 nm). A blue shift of 5 nm of emission maxima (520-515 nm) was detected (Fig. 4a). The addition of low concentrations of ANS resulted in linear increase in quantum yield leading to a saturation value exhibiting the typical hyperbolic saturation kinetics (Fig. 4b). The number of hydrophobic sites in the 25-kDa protein accessible to ANS was estimated to be 1.0 from the Scatchard plot (Fig. 4c) obtained by titrating a fixed concentration of the 25-kDa protein with increasing concentrations of ANS. The dissociation constant for the ligand-protein interaction was 0.2 mM as derived from the Hill plot. From the slope of the linear part of ANS fluorescence with increasing concentration of the protein, the hydrophobic coefficient of the 25-kDa protein was estimated and compared with those of several standard proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The hydrophobic coefficient of the 25-kDa protein was found to be about −0.02 compared to 1.31 for bovine serum albumin. This is in agreement with the amino acid composition of the protein.Figure 4:a, enhancement of ANS fluorescence in presence of the 25-kDa protein. The protein (50 μg) in 700 μl of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was treated with 150, 300, and 500 μM of ANS in water (in ascending order). Excitation wave length was 375 nm. The lowest curve represents emission spectrum of 500 μM free ANS in water. b, determination of dissociation constant of protein-ANS interaction.

The 12-kDa monomer of the 25-kDa protein was intensely labeled with 125I (Fig. 5, lane a). Thus, a major part of the 25-kDa protein is exposed on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. The other outer membrane proteins that are known to be exposed, namely 40, 38, 35, 27, and 23 kDa, were also labeled (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Radioiodination of the outer membrane of wild type and penGr mutants.

The purified 25-kDa protein does not have any β-lactamase activity as detected by microiodometry even in the presence of imipenem which is known to be an inducer of penicillinase activity (Tai et al., 1985). All attempts to induce chromosomal β-lactamase using a variety of β-lactams have been unsuccessful in V. cholerae. The absence of β-lactamase activity in the β-lactam-resistant mutants was also confirmed by bioassays based on the conversion of penicillin to penicilloic acid by penicillinase which reduces I2 to I- and examining the color change of starch-I2 blue paper. The β-lactamase-producing E. coli cells were used as control in these experiments.It has been reported that penicillin can damage bacterial cell walls by inducing autolysins (Prestidge and Pardee, 1957). To examine whether the 25-kDa protein is a β-lactam-induced autolysin, B. megaterium protoplasts were exposed to crude lysates of β-lactam-resistant V. cholerae cells, and the absorbance was monitored at different times at 670 nm. There was no detectable lysis of B. megaterium protoplasts. B. megaterium protoplasts are stable for at least 1 h in sucrose-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).Penicillin-binding proteins have been reported for both wild type and penicillin-resistant mutants of V. cholerae (Sengupta et al., 1990, 1992). None of the penicillin-binding proteins either of the wild type or the resistant mutants had a molecular size of 12 kDa in SDS-PAGE. It has been shown that all the penicillin-binding proteins of V. cholerae are located in the inner membrane, while the 25-kDa protein is an outer membrane protein.A comparison of the uptake of crystal violet in wild type and β-lactam-resistant cells suggested reduction in the permeability of the dye in the mutant cells. However, because of the nonspecificity of the crystal violet uptake these results could not be considered conclusive. To examine whether change in permeability is indeed responsible for β-lactam resistance in the mutant cells, the more sensitive liposome swelling assay (Nikaido et al., 1991) was carried out.Liposomes were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and purified OmpF-like protein of V. cholerae, which is a trimer of monomer size 38 kDa, ( 2S. Chakrabarti, K. Chaudhuri, and J. Das, unpublished observation. )was incorporated into these liposomes. The V. cholerae OmpF-like protein allowed arabinose (Fig. 6a) to enter the liposomes but not stachyose (Fig. 6b) as detected spectrophotometrically at 400 nm. When the 25-kDa protein was incorporated into the liposomes and the swelling assay was performed with different sugars, even arabinose did not enter the liposome (Fig. 6e) showing that the 25-kDa protein itself does not have any porin-like activity. No swelling of the liposomes occurred even when arabinose was used for assay (Fig. 6c) when the 25-kDa protein was added to the liposomes in which the OmpF like protein of V. cholerae was embedded. However, as soon as water was added to the liposome-OmpF-25 kDa complex, liposomes swelled almost instantaneously (Fig. 6g) indicating that there is no artifact in the experimental conditions. The results of these in vitro experiments strongly suggest that the 25-kDa protein blocks the pore"
