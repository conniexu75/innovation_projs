https://openalex.org/W2911713625,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. Stromal cells could function as providers of energy metabolites for tumor cells by undergoing the ""reverse Warburg effect,"" but the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The interaction between the tumoral microvesicles (TMVs) and stroma in the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in facilitating cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrated a novel mechanism for the TMV-mediated glycometabolic reprogramming of stromal cells. After being incubated with TMVs, normal human gingival fibroblasts exhibited a phenotype switch to cancer-associated fibroblasts and underwent a degradation of caveolin 1 (CAV1) through the ERK1/2-activation pathway. CAV1 degradation further induced the metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis in the fibroblasts. The microvesicle-activated fibroblasts absorbed more glucose and produced more lactate. The migration and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were promoted after being cocultured with the activated fibroblasts. Fibroblast-cancer cell glycometabolic coupling ring mediated by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4 and MCT1 was then proved in the tumor microenvironment. Results indicated a mechanism for tumor progression by the crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells through the reverse Warburg effect via TMVs, thereby identifying potential targets for OSCC prevention and treatment.-Jiang, E., Xu, Z., Wang, M., Yan, T., Huang, C., Zhou, X., Liu, Q., Wang, L., Chen, Y., Wang, H., Liu, K., Shao, Z., Shang, Z.

In the present study, we examined the value of FAM64A expression in the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer through bioinformatics analysis of data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The diagnostic value of FAM64A expression in pancreatic cancer tissue was deteremined through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and based on the obtained cut-off value, patients were divided into two groups (high FAM64A expression and low FAM64A expression). Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied to identify associations between FAM64A expression and clinical features. Moreover, the effect of FAM64A expression in the survival of pancreatic cancer patients was observed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the TCGA dataset. Our results showed that high FAM64A expression in pancreatic cancer was associated with survival status, overall survival (OS), and recurrence. The area under the ROC curve was 0.736, which indicated modest diagnostic value. Patients with higher FAM64A expression had significantly shorter OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) times. Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that high FAM64A expression was an independent risk factor for OS and RFS. GSEA identified mitotic spindles, myc targets, MTORC1 signaling, G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, DNA repair, glycolysis and unfolded protein response as differentially enriched with the high FAM64A expression phenotype. In conclusion, high FAM64A mRNA expression is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2911437612,"Upon inflammation, natural killer (NK) cells undergo metabolic changes to support their high energy demand for effector function and proliferation. The metabolic changes are usually accompanied by an increase in the expression of nutrient transporters, leading to increased nutrient uptake. Among various cytokines inducing NK cell proliferation, the mechanisms underlying the effect of interleukin (IL)-18 in promoting NK cell proliferation are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that IL-18 is a potent cytokine that can enhance the expression of the nutrient transporter CD98/LAT1 for amino acids independently of the mTORC1 pathway and thereby induce a dramatic metabolic change associated with increased proliferation of NK cells. Notably, treatment of IL-18-stimulated NK cells with leucine activates the metabolic sensor mTORC1, indicating that the high expression of amino acid transporters induces amino acid-driven mTORC1 activation. Inhibition of the amino acid transporter CD98/LAT1 abrogated the leucine-driven mTORC1 activation and reduced NK cell effector function. Taken together, our study identified a novel role of IL-18 in up-regulating nutrient transporters on NK cells and thereby inducing metabolic changes, including the mTORC1 activation by amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2914373477,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), like many KRAS-driven tumors, preferentially loses CDKN2A that encodes an endogenous CDK4/6 inhibitor to bypass the RB-mediated cell cycle suppression. Analysis of a panel of patient-derived cell lines and matched xenografts indicated that many pancreatic cancers have intrinsic resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition that is not due to any established mechanism or published biomarker. Rather, there is a KRAS-dependent rapid adaptive response that leads to the upregulation of cyclin proteins, which participate in functional complexes to mediate resistance. In vivo, the degree of response is associated with the suppression of a gene expression signature that is strongly prognostic in pancreatic cancer. Resistance is associated with an adaptive gene expression signature that is common to multiple kinase inhibitors, but is attenuated with MTOR inhibitors. Combination treatment with MTOR and CDK4/6 inhibitors had potent activity across a large number of patient-derived models of PDAC underscoring the potential clinical efficacy."

https://openalex.org/W2914376167,"Since the 1970s, the magnitude of turtle cold-stun strandings have increased dramatically within the northwestern Atlantic. Here, we examine oceanic, atmospheric, and biological factors that may affect the increasing trend of cold-stunned Kemp’s ridleys in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, United States of America. Using machine learning and Bayesian inference modeling techniques, we demonstrate higher cold-stunning years occur when the Gulf of Maine has warmer sea surface temperatures in late October through early November. Surprisingly, hatchling numbers in Mexico, a proxy for population abundance, was not identified as an important factor. Further, using our Bayesian count model and forecasted sea surface temperature projections, we predict more than 2,300 Kemp’s ridley turtles may cold-stun annually by 2031 as sea surface temperatures continue to increase within the Gulf of Maine. We suggest warmer sea surface temperatures may have modified the northerly distribution of Kemp’s ridleys and act as an ecological bridge between the Gulf Stream and nearshore waters. While cold-stunning may currently account for a minor proportion of juvenile mortality, we recommend continuing efforts to rehabilitate cold-stunned individuals to maintain population resiliency for this critically endangered species in the face of a changing climate and continuing anthropogenic threats."

To control for changes in prescriber adherence arising from other factors, we performed similar audits of adherence to antibiotic guidelines in two adjacent hospitals.The app was downloaded by 145 healthcare workers and accessed a total of 3985 times during the three month intervention period. There was an increase in adherence to the ACH antibiotic guidelines by prescribers caring for patients with CAP from 19% (37/199) to 27% (64/237) in the intervention period (p = 0.04); but no change in guideline adherence at an adjacent hospital. There was no change in adherence to the antibiotic guidelines by prescribers caring for patients with UTI at ACH or at the two adjacent hospitals.Provision of antibiotic guidelines in a mobile phone app can significantly increase guideline adherence by prescribers. However, providing an app which allows easy access to antibiotic guidelines is not sufficient to achieve high levels of prescriber adherence."

https://openalex.org/W2913644859,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for cancer progression. Evidence has shown that miR-22 and miR-214 play a key role in colon cancer progression; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be known. The effects of miR-22 and miR-214 on EMT are contradictory in different cancers, and whether miR-22 and miR-214 are involved in the colon cancer EMT process needs to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the exact role and the regulation mechanism of miR-22 and miR-214 in colon cancer. After transfection with miR-22 expression vector, the cell proliferation and migration capacity of HCT116 and RKO cells were significantly suppressed. Also, E-cadherin was increased and vimentin was decreased by miR-22 overexpression. Similar effects were also observed after miR-214 expression vector transfection. Dual-lucif erase reporter confirmed that BCL9L is the target gene of both miR-22 and miR-214. Silencing of BCL9L inhibits cell proliferation and migration, and the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin was also altered by BCL9L knockdown, which was consistent with miR-22 or miR-214 transfection. Furthermore, miR-22 and miR-214 inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, although the association between BCL9L's lower expression and longer survival time was statistically nonsignificant, a trend existed; further studies in a larger cohort are needed. Collectively, these data suggest that miR-22 and miR-214 inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and EMT of colon cancer, most likely by targeting BCL9L.—Sun, R., Liu, Z., Han, L., Yang, Y., Wu, F., Jiang, Q., Zhang, H., Ma, R., Miao, J., He, K., Wang, X., Zhou, D., Huang, C. miR-22 and miR-214 targeting BCL9L inhibit proliferation, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by down-regulating Wnt signliang in colon cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2801926392,"Our personalities (who we are) influence our social relationships (how we relate to people around us), and our social relationships influence our personalities. However, little is known about the specific processes underlying the complex interplay of personality and social relationships. According to the PERSOC framework, the identification of underlying social interaction processes promotes the understanding of how personality and social relationships are expressed, develop, and influence each other over time. The aim of the present paper is twofold: First, we outline and discuss four methodological challenges that arise when trying to empirically realize a process approach to the personality-relationship interplay. Second, we describe two data sets that are designed to meet these challenges and that are open for collaborative investigations: a laboratory-based process approach (Personality Interaction Laboratory Study; PILS) and a field-based process approach (CONNECT). We provide detailed information on the samples (two student samples; PILS: N = 311; CONNECT: N = 131), procedures (longitudinal and multimethodological), and measures (personality and social relationships, appearance and behavior, interpersonal perceptions), for which we present descriptive information, reliabilities, and intercorrelations. We summarize how these studies’ designs targeted the introduced methodological challenges, discuss the advantages and limitations of laboratory- and field-based process approaches, and call for their combination. We close by outlining an open research policy, aimed at accelerated collaborative efforts to further open the process black box, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the expression, development, and complex interplay of personality and social relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2912716286,"The snow leopard Panthera uncia is an elusive species inhabiting some of the most remote and inaccessible tracts of Central and South Asia. It is difficult to determine its distribution and density pattern, which are crucial for developing conservation strategies. Several techniques for species detection combining camera traps with remote sensing and geographic information systems have been developed to model the habitat of such cryptic and low-density species in challenging terrains. Utilising presence-only data from camera traps and direct observations, alongside six environmental variables (elevation, aspect, ruggedness, distance to water, land cover, and prey habitat suitability), we assessed snow leopard habitat suitability across Ladakh in northern India. This is the first study to model snow leopard distribution both in India and utilising direct observation data. Results suggested that elevation and ruggedness are the two most influential environmental variables for snow leopard habitat suitability, with highly suitable habitat having an elevation range of 2,800 m to 4,600 m and ruggedness of 450 m to 1,800 m. Our habitat suitability map estimated approximately 12% of Ladakh's geographical area (c. 90,000 km2) as highly suitable and 18% as medium suitability. We found that 62.5% of recorded livestock depredation along with over half of all livestock corrals (54%) and homestays (58%) occurred within highly suitable snow leopard habitat. Our habitat suitability model can be used to assist in allocation of conservation resources by targeting construction of livestock corrals to areas of high habitat suitability and promoting ecotourism programs in villages in highly suitable snow leopard habitat."

Here, we report a detailed characterization of human neuronal networks induced by the expression of human NEUROG2 together with human NEUROG2/1 in hESCs using molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological measurements over 60 d after induction. Both excitatory synaptic transmission and network firing activity increased over time. Strikingly, inhibitory synaptic transmission and GABAergic cells were identified from NEUROG2/1 induced neurons (iNs). To illustrate the application of such iNs, we demonstrated that the heterozygous knock out of SCN2A, whose loss-of-function mutation is strongly implicated in autism risk, led to a dramatic reduction in network activity in the NEUROG2/1 iNs. Our findings not only extend our understanding of the NEUROG2/1-induced human neuronal network but also substantiate NEUROG2/1 iNs as an in vitro system for modeling neuronal and functional deficits on a human genetic background.-Lu, C., Shi, X., Allen, A., Baez-Nieto, D., Nikish, A., Sanjana, N.

https://openalex.org/W2950368373,"Background Resistant starch is a prebiotic metabolized by the gut bacteria. It has been shown to attenuate chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in rats. Previous studies employed taxonomic analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics profiling. Here we expand these studies by metaproteomics, gaining new insight into the host-microbiome interaction. Methods Differences between cecum contents in CKD rats fed a diet containing resistant starch with those fed a diet containing digestible starch were examined by comparative metaproteomics analysis. Taxonomic information was obtained using unique protein sequences. Our methodology results in quantitative data covering both host and bacterial proteins. Results 5,834 proteins were quantified, with 947 proteins originating from the host organism. Taxonomic information derived from metaproteomics data surpassed previous 16S RNA analysis, and reached species resolutions for moderately abundant taxonomic groups. In particular, the Ruminococcaceae family becomes well resolved–with butyrate producers and amylolytic species such as R. bromii clearly visible and significantly higher while fibrolytic species such as R. flavefaciens are significantly lower with resistant starch feeding. The observed changes in protein patterns are consistent with fiber-associated improvement in CKD phenotype. Several known host CKD-associated proteins and biomarkers of impaired kidney function were significantly reduced with resistant starch supplementation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008845. Conclusions Metaproteomics analysis of cecum contents of CKD rats with and without resistant starch supplementation reveals changes within gut microbiota at unprecedented resolution, providing both functional and taxonomic information. Proteins and organisms differentially abundant with RS supplementation point toward a shift from mucin degraders to butyrate producers."
https://openalex.org/W2951800859,"Cancer is caused by a series of alterations in genome and epigenome and exists in multiple complex forms, making it difficult to be prevented and/or treated. Telomerase, an enzyme responsible for the maintenance of telomere, is silent in most normal somatic cells but activated in 90% of cancer cells, making it an excellent target for cancer therapy. Therefore, various telomerase activity inhibitors have been developed to treat cancer but all failed due to side effects. Here we acted oppositely to develop a cancer gene therapy named telomerase-activating gene expression (Tage) system by utilizing the telomerase activity in cancer cells. The Tage system consisted of an effector gene expression vector that carried a 3ʹ telomerase-recognizable stick end and an artificial transcription factor expression vector that could express dCas9-VP64 and an sgRNA targeting telomere repeat sequences. By using Cas9 as an effector gene, the Tage system effectively killed various cancer cells, including HepG2, HeLa, PANC-1, MDA-MB-453, A549, HT-29, SKOV-3, Hepa1-6, and RAW264.7, without affecting normal cells MRC-5, HL7702, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC). More importantly, a four-base 3ʹ stick end produced by the homothallic switching endonuclease in cells could be recognized by telomerase, allowing the Tage system to effectively kill cancer cells in vivo. The Tage system could effectively and safely realize its in vivo application by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as gene vector. The virus-loaded Tage system could significantly and specifically kill cancer cells in mice by intravenous drug administration without side effects or toxicity."

NHERF1 is a phosphoprotein with 40 Ser and Thr residues. Here, using tandem MS analysis, we characterized the sites of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced NHERF1 phosphorylation and identified 10 high-confidence phosphorylation sites. Ala replacement at Ser46, Ser162, Ser181, Ser269, Ser280, Ser291, Thr293, Ser299, and Ser302 did not affect phosphate uptake, but S290A substitution abolished PTH-dependent phosphate transport. Unexpectedly, Ser290 was rapidly dephosphorylated and rephosphorylated after PTH stimulation, and we found that protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α), which binds NHERF1 through a conserved VxF/W PP1 motif, dephosphorylates Ser290. Mutating 257VPF259 eliminated PP1 binding and blunted dephosphorylation. Tautomycetin blocked PP1 activity and abrogated PTH-sensitive phosphate transport. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we observed that PTH paradoxically and transiently elevates intracellular phosphate. Added phosphate blocked PP1α-mediated Ser290 dephosphorylation of recombinant NHERF1. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS revealed that β-sheets in NHERF1’s PDZ2 domain display lower deuterium uptake than those in the structurally similar PDZ1, implying that PDZ1 is more cloistered. Dephosphorylated NHERF1 exhibited faster exchange at C-terminal residues suggesting that NHERF1 dephosphorylation precedes Ser290 rephosphorylation.

NHERF1 is a phosphoprotein possessing 31 Ser and 9 Thr residues. Although these sites are dispersed throughout the protein, there is a conspicuous Ser-rich cluster located in the linker region between PDZ2 and the EBD (Fig. 1). NHERF1 displays a combination of structurally defined and undefined regions. The two PDZ segments are highly organized, which permitted their structures to be solved by X-ray diffraction and solution NMR (18Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A.

The linker regions separating the two PDZ domains and between PDZ2 and the EBD are intrinsically disordered (ID). This flexibility permits NHERF1 to assume open and closed conformations, wherein the C-terminal tail of NHERF1, itself a PDZ ligand (–Ser–Asn–Leu), engages the core-binding segment of PDZ2 in an intramolecular manner (20Morales F.C.

The ID region between PDZ2 and the EBD may be unavailable for binding in the closed conformation. Previous work established that some human NHERF1 mutations, viz. R153Q, stabilize the closed NHERF1 conformation, preventing access of PKA regulatory subunits to bound ezrin that in turn interferes with hormone action and leads to renal phosphate wasting (13Karim Z.

Introducing a second compensatory mutation of the NHERF1 PDZ ligand (−SNA) prevented formation of the closed conformation and overcame the nominally deleterious action of the inherited mutation on signaling and function. These observations regarding the Ser-rich cluster within the linker domain, combined with the finding that the closed NHERF1 conformation prevents engagement of PKA regulatory subunit binding and function, suggest that phosphorylation within this cluster may regulate hormone action by controlling access to these critical binding sites. Compared with structurally determined rigid protein domains, ID regions contain a higher density of phosphorylation sites (24Iakoucheva L.M. Radivojac P. Brown C.J. O'Connor T.R. Sikes J.G.

https://openalex.org/W2911917639,"High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been used to identify the intestinal microbiota of many animal species, but that of marine invertebrate organisms remains largely unknown. There are only a few high-throughput sequencing studies on the intestinal microbiota of echinoderms (non-vertebrate Deuterostomes). Here we describe the intestinal microbiota of the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima, an echinoderm, well-known for its remarkable power of regeneration. We characterized the microbiota from the anterior descending intestine, the medial intestine (these two comprise the small intestine) and the posterior descending intestine (or large intestine), using pyrosequencing to sequence the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We compared animals in their natural marine environment and in sea-water aquaria. A total of 8,172 OTU’s were grouped in 10 bacterial phyla, 23 classes, 44 orders, 83 families, 127 genera and 1 group of unknown bacteria, present across the digestive tract of 10 specimens. The results showed that the anterior intestine is dominated by Proteobacteria (61%) and Bacteroidetes (22%), the medium intestine is similar but with lower Bacteroidetes (4%), and the posterior intestine was remarkably different, dominated by Firmicutes (48%) and Bacteroidetes (35%). The structure of the community changed in animals kept in aquaria, which had a general dominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, regardless the intestinal segment. Our results evidence that in the natural sea environment, there is intestinal segment differentiation in the microbiota of H. glaberrima, which is lost in artificial conditions. This is relevant for physiological studies, such as mechanisms of digestive regeneration, which might be affected by the microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2951157028,"The resilience of regeneration in vertebrates is not very well understood. Yet understanding if tissues can regenerate after repeated insults, and identifying limitations, is important for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of tissue plasticity. This is particularly challenging in tissues, such as the nervous system, which possess a large number of terminally differentiated cells and often exhibit limited regeneration in the first place. However, unlike mammals, which exhibit very limited regeneration of spinal cord tissues, many non-mammalian vertebrates, including lampreys, bony fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, regenerate their spinal cords and functionally recover even after a complete spinal cord transection. It is well established that lampreys undergo full functional recovery of swimming behaviors after a single spinal cord transection, which is accompanied by tissue repair at the lesion site, as well as axon and synapse regeneration. Here we begin to explore the resilience of spinal cord regeneration in lampreys after a second spinal transection (re-transection). We report that by all functional and anatomical measures tested, lampreys regenerate after spinal re-transection just as robustly as after single transections. Recovery of swimming, synapse and cytoskeletal distributions, axon regeneration, and neuronal survival were nearly identical after spinal transection or re-transection. Only minor differences in tissue repair at the lesion site were observed in re-transected spinal cords. Thus, regenerative potential in the lamprey spinal cord is largely unaffected by spinal re-transection, indicating a greater persistent regenerative potential than exists in some other highly regenerative models. These findings establish a new path for uncovering pro-regenerative targets that could be deployed in non-regenerative conditions."

Nr4a proteins play key roles in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in peripheral metabolic tissues. However, their biological functions in β-cells remain relatively uncharacterized. Here we sought to investigate the potential role of Nor1 in the regulation of β-cell mass and, in particular, β-cell survival/apoptosis. We used histological analysis to examine the consequences of genetic deletion of either Nur77 and Nor1 on β-cell mass, investigated the expression patterns of Nr4as in human islets and INS cells and performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments to further characterize the role of Nor1 in β-cell apoptosis. Surprisingly, Nor1 knockout mice displayed increased β-cell mass, whereas mice with genetic deletion of Nur77 did not exhibit any significant differences compared with their WT littermates. The increase in β-cell mass in Nor1 knockout mice was accompanied by improved glucose tolerance. A gene expression study performed in both human islets and INS cells revealed that Nor1 expression is significantly increased by pro-inflammatory cytokines and, to a lesser extent, by elevated concentrations of glucose. Nor1 overexpression in both INS and human islet cells caused apoptosis, whereas siRNA-mediated Nor1 knockdown prevented cytokine-induced β-cell death. Finally, Nor1 expression was up-regulated in islets of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Altogether, our results uncover that Nor1 negatively regulates β-cell mass.

Nor1 represents a promising molecular target in diabetes treatment to prevent β-cell destruction."

To date, two classes of AI-2 receptors have been identified: the LuxP-type, present in the Vibrionales, and the LsrB-type, found in a number of phylogenetically distinct bacterial families. Recently, AI-2 was shown to affect the colonization levels of a variety of bacteria in the microbiome of the mouse gut, including members of the genus Clostridium, but no AI-2 receptor had been identified in this genus. Here, we identify a noncanonical, functional LsrB-type receptor in Clostridium saccharobutylicum. This novel LsrB-like receptor is the first one reported with variations in the binding-site amino acid residues that interact with AI-2. The crystal structure of the C. saccharobutylicum receptor determined at 1.35 Å resolution revealed that it binds the same form of AI-2 as the other known LsrB-type receptors, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays showed that binding of AI-2 occurs at a submicromolar concentration. Using phylogenetic analysis, we inferred that the newly identified noncanonical LsrB receptor shares a common ancestor with known LsrB receptors and that noncanonical receptors are present in bacteria from different phyla. This led us to identify putative AI-2 receptors in bacterial species in which no receptors were known, as in bacteria belonging to the Spirochaetes and Actinobacteria phyla. Thus, this work represents a significant step toward understanding how AI-2–mediated quorum sensing influences bacterial interactions in complex biological niches.

https://openalex.org/W2914681084,"HIV-1 entry into cells is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (Env) and represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Two drugs that inhibit HIV entry are approved for clinical use: the membrane fusion-inhibitor T20 (Fuzeon, enfuvirtide) and the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) blocker maraviroc (Selzentry). Another class of entry inhibitors supposedly target the fusion peptide (FP) and are termed anchor inhibitors. These include the VIRIP peptide and VIRIP derivatives such as VIR165, VIR353, and VIR576. Here, we investigated the mechanism of inhibition by VIR165. We show that substitutions within the FP modulate sensitivity to VIR165, consistent with the FP being the drug target. Our results also revealed that VIR165 acts during an intermediate post-CD4-binding entry step that is overlapping but not identical to the step inhibited by fusion inhibitors such as T20. We found that some but not all resistance mutations to heptad repeat 2 (HR2)-targeting fusion inhibitors can provide cross-resistance to VIR165. In contrast, resistance mutations in the HR1-binding site for the fusion inhibitors did not cause cross-resistance to VIR165. However, Env with mutations located outside this binding site and thought to affect fusion kinetics, exhibited decreased sensitivity to VIR165. Although we found a strong correlation between Env stability and resistance to HR2-based fusion inhibitors, such correlation was not observed for Env stability and VIR165 resistance. We conclude that VIRIP analogs target the FP during an intermediate, post-CD4-binding entry step that overlaps with but is distinct from the step(s) inhibited by HR2-based fusion inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2913919892,"Toxin synthesis and endospore formation are two of the most critical factors that determine the outcome of infection by Clostridioides difficile. The two major toxins, TcdA and TcdB, are the principal factors causing damage to the host. Spores are the infectious form of C. difficile, permit survival of the bacterium during antibiotic treatment and are the predominant cell form that leads to recurrent infection. Toxin production and sporulation have their own specific mechanisms of regulation, but they share negative regulation by the global regulatory protein CodY. Determining the extent of such regulation and its detailed mechanism is important for understanding the linkage between two apparently independent biological phenomena and raises the possibility of creating new ways of limiting infection. The work described here shows that a codY null mutant of a hypervirulent (ribotype 027) strain is even more virulent than its parent in a mouse model of infection and that the mutant expresses most sporulation genes prematurely during exponential growth phase. Moreover, examining the expression patterns of mutants producing CodY proteins with different levels of residual activity revealed that expression of the toxin genes is dependent on total CodY inactivation, whereas most sporulation genes are turned on when CodY activity is only partially diminished. These results suggest that, in wild-type cells undergoing nutrient limitation, sporulation genes can be turned on before the toxin genes."

Nevertheless, there are very few taxonomies of facial features. Ergonomics, forensic anthropology, crime prevention or new human-machine interaction systems and online activities, like e-commerce, e-learning, games, dating or social networks, are fields in which classifications of facial features are useful, for example, to create digital interlocutors that optimize the interactions between human and machines. However, classifying isolated facial features is difficult for human observers. Previous works reported low inter-observer and intra-observer agreement in the evaluation of facial features. This work presents a computer-based procedure to automatically classify facial features based on their global appearance. This procedure deals with the difficulties associated with classifying features using judgements from human observers, and facilitates the development of taxonomies of facial features. Taxonomies obtained through this procedure are presented for eyes, mouths and noses."

Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine which plant species the rural community of Bananal, Mato Grosso, Brazil, uses by calculating the levels of fidelity and concordance regarding species uses among residents and to determine if there is a relationship between the number of known useful plants and levels of education, age, and residence time. Ethnobotanical data was collected from residents of the community through semi-structured interviews in January/December/2016. Species diversity was calculated using Shannon-Wiener, Level of Fidelity (LF), Correction Factor, and the Percentage of Agreement regarding the Main Uses (AMU). Statistical tests were performed using generalized linear models (GLM) in the R environment. The plant use indications were grouped according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 10). We found 152 species belonging to 130 genera and 67 families. The most frequently used plant parts were leaves, and decoction was the most frequent preparation mode. Strychnos pseudoquina was the species with the highest amount of use indications. The diversity index was 4.5 nats/ind-1. The body system with the most citations was the code XVIII of ICD 10, corresponding to the species: alfavaca, mentraste, terramicina, angelim, fedegoso. Medicinal species with AMU values higher than 25% were: Strychnos pseudoquina, Plectranthus barbatus, Citrus sinensis cv. pera, Cymbopogon citratus. There was a relationship between the number of useful plants and the residence time of the participants. The Bananal community revealed high species richness and the relationship of knowledge showed that the older the residents and the longer their residence time in the community, the more knowledge they acquired."
https://openalex.org/W2914325445,"Purpose The present study examined changes in body composition, maximum oxygen uptake, and physical activity in sedentary office employees prescribed with two different walking programs during a 10-week intervention. Methods 68 sedentary employees were randomly assigned to one of three groups: multiple bouts of walking (n = 24 (5 male, 19 female) Age = 46±9, BMI = 30.5±5.78 kg/m2), continuous walking (n = 22 (6 male, 16 female) Age = 48±9, BMI = 30.6±6.2 kg/m2) and the control group (n = 22 (5 male, 17 female) Age = 42±10, BMI = 27.5±5.23 kg/m2). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA) assessed body composition and a Bruce protocol treadmill test assessed aerobic fitness at baseline and week 11. At baseline, week 6 and week 11 a waist worn accelerometer measured physical activity and sedentary behavior. Physical activity was measured throughout the program with a wrist worn accelerometer. Results The results from the mixed-design ANOVA show that fat mass (p < .000) and fat percentage (p < .000) decreased for all three groups as a main effect of time. Sedentary behavior did not change (p>0.05) for all three groups. Moderate intensity physical activity increased significantly from pre-test to week 6 (p<0.05), then decreased from week 6 to post-test (p<0.05), with no significant changes observed from pre-test to post-test (p>0.05) for all groups. No changes in VO2 were observed (p>0.05) for all groups. Conclusions Continuous or intermittent walking activity produce similar benefits on body weight, fat mass and body fat percentage in sedentary employees. Meanwhile, intermittent walking allowed these sedentary employees to increase lean mass and fat free mass. Intermittent walking could provide at least similar benefits on body composition compared to a continuous walking program."

In this comprehensive observational study, we describe in detail the formation of the BRB at the molecular level in physiologic conditions, using mice from postnatal day (P)3 to P25. Our data indicate that immature blood vessels already have tight junctions at P5, before the formation of a functional BRB. Expression of the endothelial cell-specific protein plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP), which is known to be involved in transcellular transport and associated with BRB permeability, decreased during development and was absent when a functional barrier was formed. Moreover, we show that PLVAP deficiency causes a transient delay in retinal vascular development and changes in mRNA expression levels of endothelial permeability pathway proteins.—Van der Wijk, A.-E., Wisniewska-Kruk, J., Vogels, I.

https://openalex.org/W2914599589,"Vibration, in the form of high frequency acceleration (HFA), stimulates alveolar bone formation under physiologic conditions and during healing after dental extractions. It is not known if HFA has an anabolic effect on osteoporotic alveolar bone. Our objective is to determine if HFA has a regenerative effect on osteoporotic alveolar bone.Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: 1) Ovariectomized Group (OVX), 2) Sham-OVX Group that received surgery without ovariectomy, 3) OVX-HFA Group that was ovariectomized and treated daily with HFA, 4) OVX+Static Force Group that was ovariectomized and received the same force as HFA, but without vibration, and 5) Control Group that did not receive any treatment. All animals were fed a low mineral diet for 3 months. Osteoporosis was confirmed by micro-CT of the fifth lumbar vertebra and femoral head. HFA was applied to the maxillary first molar for 5 minutes/day for 28 and 56 days. Maxillae were collected for micro-CT, histology, fluorescent microscopy, protein and RNA analysis, and three-point bending mechanical testing.Micro-CT analysis revealed significant alveolar bone osteoporosis in the OVX group. Vibration restored the quality and quantity of alveolar bone to levels similar to the Sham-OVX group. Animals exposed to HFA demonstrated higher osteoblast activity and lower osteoclast activity. Osteogenic transcription factors (RUNX2, Foxo1, Osterix and Wnt signaling factors) were upregulated following vibration, while RANKL/RANK and Sclerostin were downregulated. HFA did not affect serum TRAcP-5b or CTx-1 levels. The osteogenic effect was highest at the point of HFA application and extended along the hemimaxillae this effect did not cross to the contra-lateral side.Local application of vibration generated gradients of increased anabolic metabolism and decreased catabolic metabolism in alveolar bone of osteoporotic rats. Our findings suggest that HFA could be a predictable treatment for diminished alveolar bone levels in osteoporosis patients."

The results demonstrated that optimal dietary SIF supplementation improved the protein and total PUFA content, especially healthcare n-3 PUFA (C18: 3n-3, EPA and DHA), and increased the flavour-related free amino acid [especially umami amino acid] and 5'-inosine monophosphate content, improving the health benefits and flavour quality indicators in the muscle of grass carp. In addition, optimal dietary SIF supplementation (25 or 50 mg SIF/kg diet) enhanced some physical properties [water-holding capacity and tenderness] and increased the collagen content; however, it reduced cathepsin activity and apoptosis. SIF supplementation enhanced the glutathione content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (except CuZnSOD) by regulating their gene expression. The gene expression could be regulated by NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling in the muscle of grass carp. We demonstrated that optimal dietary SIF supplementation elevated the health benefits, flavour quality indicators and physical properties of fish muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2897150053,"It is generally accepted that radiotherapy must target clonogenic cells, i.e., those cells in a tumour that have self-renewing potential. Focussing on isolated clonogenic cells, however, may lead to an underestimate or even to an outright neglect of the importance of biological mechanisms that regulate tumour cell sensitivity to radiation. We develop a new statistical and experimental approach to quantify the effects of radiation on cell populations as a whole. In our experiments, we change the proximity relationships of the cells by culturing them in wells with different shapes, and we find that the radiosensitivity of T47D human breast carcinoma cells in tight clusters is different from that of isolated cells. Molecular analyses show that T47D cells express a Syncytin-1 homologous protein (SyHP). We observe that SyHP translocates to the external surface of the plasma membrane of cells killed by radiation treatment. The data support the fundamental role of SyHP in the formation of intercellular cytoplasmic bridges and in the enhanced radioresistance of surviving cells. We conclude that complex and unexpected biological mechanisms of tumour radioresistance take place at the cell population level. These mechanisms may significantly bias our estimates of the radiosensitivity of breast carcinomas in vivo and thereby affect treatment plans, and they call for further investigations."

The attributes of NPEV infections in nonpolio-AFP (NPAFP) cases from Uttar Pradesh (UP), India, remain undetermined and are thus investigated. A total of 1839 stool samples collected from patients with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from UP, India, between January 2010 and October 2011 were analyzed as per the WHO algorithm. A total of 359 NPAFP cases yielded NPEVs, which were subjected to microneutralization assay, partial VP1 gene-based molecular serotyping and phylogenetic analysis. Demographic and clinical-epidemiological features were also ascertained. Echoviruses (29%) and Coxsackievirus (CV)-B (17%) were the most common viruses identified by the microneutralization assay. The molecular genotyping characterized the NPEVs into 34 different serotypes, corresponding to Enterovirus (EV)-A (1.6%), EV-B (94%) and EV-C (5.3%) species. The rarely described EV serotypes, such as EV-C95, CV-A20, EV-C105, EV-B75, EV-B101, and EV-B107, were also identified. NPEV-associated AFP was more prevalent in younger male children, peaked in the monsoon months and was predominantly found in the central part of the state. The NPEV strains isolated in the study exhibited genetic diversity from those isolated in other countries. These form part of a different cluster or subcluster existing in cocirculation, limited to India only. This study augments the understanding of epidemiological features and demonstrates the extensive diversity exhibited by the NPEV strains in NPAFP cases from the polio-endemic region. It also underscores the need or effective long-term strategies to monitor NPEV circulation and its associated health risks in the post-polio eradication era."
https://openalex.org/W2913243228,"This study compares living (LA) and dead (DA) benthic foraminiferal assemblages and identifies different factors that possibly cause differences in the distribution of both assemblages in the Aveiro Continental Shelf (Portugal). A total of 44 sediment samples was collected during summers of 1994 and 1995 along transects (east-west direction) and between 10 and 200 m water depth. Complex statistical analyses allow us to compare the abundance and composition of the LAs and DAs in function of depth, grain-size and total organic matter in all studied stations even in those where the numbers of individuals were rare in one or both assemblages. The highest densities and diversities of the LAs are found in the middle continental shelf on gravel deposits (coarse and very coarse sands) mostly due to the substrate stability, reduced deposition of fine sedimentary particles, availability of organic matter with high quality related to oceanic primary productivity likely induced by upwelling events, and oxygenated porewaters conditions. The DAs have, in general, higher densities and diversities than the LAs. In the outer continental shelf, the dissimilarity between both assemblages is higher due to the accumulation of tests, low dilution by sedimentary particles and scarcity of living foraminifera. Based on the comparison of LAs and DAs and considering the characteristics of the study area and the species ecology, it has been possible to understand the cause of temporal deviation between the LAs and DAs of benthic foraminifera. This deviation is much more pronounced in the inner shelf where the energy of the waves and the currents induce very dynamic sedimentary processes preventing the development of large LAs and the preservation of DAs. Some deviation also occurs in the middle shelf due to the seasonal loss of empty tests. The most well-preserved time-averaged DAs were found in the outer continental shelf."

We use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data from the European Patients Evaluate General/Family Practice (EUROPEP) patient satisfaction survey, to focus on the fundamental dimensions of patient satisfaction and to decrease the need for multiple hypothesis testing. We identified two key principal components. The first captured primarily information on satisfaction with provider behavior and the second on satisfaction with the organization of care. We then use these two principal components as outcome variables in our panel analysis to estimate the causal impact of the introduction of the Family Medicine Model.The Family Medicine Model significantly improved patient satisfaction across a range of dimensions. The coefficient results showed a positive and statistically significant impact (p-values<0.05) of the Family Medicine Model on the outcome variables representing the satisfaction dimensions clinical behaviour and the organization of care even after controlling for calendar time fixed effects.The introduction of the Family Medicine Model in Turkey, which was primarily aimed at achieving universal health coverage goals, substantially improved patient satisfaction.

We still know little about the biological and environmental factors that influence our navigational ability. Here, we investigated the frequency and sociodemographic determinants of wayfinding and their association with vestibular function in a representative cross-sectional sample (N = 783) of the adult German-speaking population. Wayfinding was assessed using the Wayfinding Strategy Scale, a self-report scale that produces two scores for each participant representing to what degree they rely on route-based or orientation (map-based) strategies. We were interested in the following research questions: (1) the frequency and determinants of wayfinding strategies in a population-based representative sample, (2) the relationship between vestibular function and strategy choice and (3) how sociodemographic factors influence general wayfinding ability as measured using a combined score from both strategy scores. Our linear regression models showed that being male, having a higher education, higher age and lower regional urbanization increased orientation strategy scores. Vertigo/dizziness reduced the scores of both the orientation and the route strategies. Using a novel approach, we grouped participants by their combined strategy scores in a multinomial regression model, to see whether individuals prefer one strategy over the other. The majority of individuals reported using either both or no strategy, instead of preferring one strategy over the other. Young age and reduced vestibular function were indicative of using no strategy. In summary, wayfinding ability depends on both biological and environmental factors; all sociodemographic factors except income. Over a third of the population, predominantly under the age of 35, does not successfully use either strategy. This represents a change in our wayfinding skills, which may result from the technological advances in navigational aids over the last few decades."

https://openalex.org/W2914068354,"Gliomas are the most common malignant tumors of the brain and are characteristic of severe migration and invasion. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes glioma development process. However, the regulatory mechanisms of promoting occurrence and development of glioma have not yet been clearly elucidated. In the present study, the mechanism by which GDNF promotes glioma cell migration and invasion through regulating the dispersion and location of the Golgi apparatus (GA) is described. Following GDNF treatment, a change in the volume and position of GA was observed. The stack area of the GA was enlarged and it was more concentrated near the nucleus. Golgin-160 and Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP210) were identified as target molecules regulating GA positioning. In the absence of either golgin-160 or GMAP210 using lentivirus, the migration and invasion of U251 cells were decreased, while it was increased following GDNF. It was also found that the GA was decreased in size and dispersed following golgin-160 or GMAP210 knockdown, as determined by GA green fluorescence assay. Once GDNF was added, the above phenomenon would be twisted, and the concentrated location and volume of the GA was restored. In combination, the present data suggested that the regulation of the position and size of the GA by golgin-160 and GMAP210 play an important role in U251 cell migration and invasion."

Even though the development of lesions caused by ORFV was extensively studied in animals, only limited knowledge exists about the lesion development in human skin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a three-dimensional (3D) organotypic culture (OTC) as a human skin model for ORFV infection considering lesion development, replication of the virus, viral gene transcription and modulation of differentiation of human keratinocytes by ORFV. ORFV infection of OTC was performed using the ORFV isolate B029 derived from a human patient. The OTC sections showed a similar structure of stratified epidermal keratinocytes as human foreskin and a similar expression profile of the differentiation markers keratin 1 (K1), K10, and loricrin. Upon ORFV infection, OTCs exhibited histological cytopathic changes including hyperkeratosis and ballooning degeneration of the keratinocytes. ORFV persisted for 10 days and was located in keratinocytes of the outer epidermal layers. ORFV-specific early, intermediate and late genes were transcribed, but limited viral spread and restricted cell infection were noticed. ORFV infection resulted in downregulation of K1, K10, and loricrin at the transcriptional level without affecting proliferation as shown by PCNA or Ki-67 expression. In conclusion, OTC provides a suitable model to study the interaction of virus with human keratinocytes in a similar structural setting as human skin and reveals that ORFV infection downregulates several differentiation markers in the epidermis of the human skin, a hitherto unknown feature of dermal ORFV infection in man."

Methods A de novo preliminary state transition (Markov) model was developed. The model was informed by systematic literature review and expert opinion. The uncertainty around the results was assessed both by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The economic evaluation was conducted from National Health Service (NHS) England perspective. The main outcome measure was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), with cost-effectiveness plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves presented for alternative willingness-to-pay thresholds. Results Oral contraceptives dominated ‘no hormonal treatment’ and provided more QALYs at a lower cost than ‘no hormonal treatment’, with a cost-effectiveness probability of 98%. A one-way sensitivity analysis excluding general practitioner consultations showed that oral contraceptives were still cost-effective. Conclusions The analyses showed that oral contraceptives could be an effective option for the treatment of endometriosis, as this treatment was shown to provide a higher level of QALYs at a lower cost, compared to ‘no hormonal treatment’. The results are subject to considerable parameter uncertainty as a range of assumptions were required as part of the modelling process."

Some tetranoids (grouse spp.) species are particularly vulnerable to tall anthropogenic structures because they evolved in ecosystems void of vertical structures. In western North America, electric power transmission and distribution lines (power lines) occur in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) landscapes within the range of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended using buffer zones near leks to mitigate the potential impacts of power lines on sage-grouse. However, recommended buffer distances are inconsistent across state and federal agencies because data are lacking. To address this, we evaluated the effects of power lines on sage-grouse breeding ecology within Utah, portions of southeastern Idaho, and southwestern Wyoming from 1998-2013. Overall, power lines negatively affected lek trends up to a distance of 2.7 and 2.8 km, respectively. Power lines died not affect lek persistence. Female sage-grouse avoided transmission lines during the nesting and brooding seasons at distances up to 1.1 and 0.8 km, respectively. Nest and brood success were negatively affected by transmission lines up to distances of 2.6 and 1.1 km, respectively. Distribution lines did not appear to affect sage-grouse habitat selection or reproductive fitness. Our analyses demonstrated the value of sagebrush cover in mitigating potential power line impacts. Managers can minimize the effects of new transmission power lines by placing them in existing anthropogenic corridors and/or incorporating buffers at least 2.8 km from active leks. Given the uncertainty we observed in our analyses regarding sage-grouse response to distribution lines coupled with their role in providing electric power service directly to individual consumers, we recommend that buffers for these power lines be considered on a case-by-case basis. Micrositing to avoid important habitats and habitat reclamation may reduce the potential impacts of new power line construction."

https://openalex.org/W2911782104,"Cellular functions are regulated by the up- and down-regulation and localization of RNA molecules. Therefore, many RNA detection methods have been developed to analyze RNA levels and localization. Molecular beacon (MB) is one of the major methods for quantitative RNA detection and analysis of RNA localization. Most oligonucleotide-based probes, including MB, are designed to target a long flexible region on the target RNA molecule, e.g., a single-stranded region. Recently, analyses of tRNA localization and levels became important, as it has been shown that environmental stresses and chemical reagents induce nuclear accumulation of tRNA and tRNA degradation in mammalian cells. However, tRNA is highly structured and does not harbor any long flexible regions. Hence, only a few methods are currently available for detecting tRNA. In the present study, we attempted to detect elongator tRNAMet (eMet) and initiator tRNAMet (iMet) by using an in-stem molecular beacon (ISMB), characterized by more effective quenching and significantly higher sensitivity than those of conventional MB. We found that ISMB1 targeted a 5′- region that includes the D arm of tRNA and that it detected eMet and iMet transcripts as well as mature eMet with high sensitivity. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the formation of the ISMB/tRNA transcript complex required more time than the formation of an ISMB/unstructured short RNA complex. These results suggest that ISMB-based tRNA detection can be a useful tool for various biological and medical studies."

The Asiatic tribe Trichosporeae contains most reversals to actinomorphy. We thus investigated shifts in GCYC gene expression among selected zygomorphic species (Hemiboea bicornuta and Lysionotus pauciflorus) and species with reversals to actinomorphy (Conandron ramondioides) by RT-PCR. In the actinomorphic C. ramondioides, none of the three copies of GCYC was found expressed in petals implying that the reversal was a loss-of-function event. On the other hand, both zygomorphic species retained one GCYC1 copy that was expressed in the dorsal petals but each species utilized a different copy (GCYC1C for H. bicornuta and GCYC1D for L. pauciflorus). Together with previously published data, it appeared that GCYC1C and GCYC1D copies diversified their expression in a distinct species-specific pattern. To detect whether the selection signal (ω) changed before and after the duplication of GCYC1 in Asiatic Trichosporeae, we reconstructed a GCYC phylogeny using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference algorithms and examined selection signals using PAML. The PAML analysis detected relaxation from selection right after the GCYC1 duplication (ωpre-duplication = 0.2819, ωpost-duplication = 0.3985) among Asiatic Trichosporeae species. We propose that the selection relaxation after the GCYC1 duplication created an ""evolutionary window of flexibility"" in which multiple copies were retained with randomly diverged roles for dorsal-specific expressions in association with floral symmetry changes."

Exocytosis in platelets is mediated by SNARE proteins, and in most mammalian cells this process is controlled by Munc18 (mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans uncoordinated gene 18) proteins. Platelets express all Munc18 paralogs (Munc18-1, -2, and -3), but their roles in platelet secretion and function have not been fully characterized. Using Munc18-1, -2, and -3 conditional knockout mice, here we deleted expression of these proteins in platelets and assessed granule exocytosis. We measured products secreted by each type of platelet granule and analyzed EM platelet profiles by design-based stereology. We observed that the removal of Munc18-2 ablates the release of alpha, dense, and lysosomal granules from platelets, but we found no exocytic role for Munc18-1 or -3 in platelets. In vitro, Munc18-2–deficient platelets exhibited defective aggregation at low doses of collagen and impaired thrombus formation under shear stress. In vivo, megakaryocyte-specific Munc18-2 conditional knockout mice had a severe hemostatic defect and prolonged arterial and venous bleeding times. They were also protected against arterial thrombosis in a chemically induced model of arterial injury. Taken together, our results indicate that Munc18-2, but not Munc18-1 or Munc18-3, is essential for regulated exocytosis in platelets and platelet participation in thrombosis and hemostasis.

Exocytosis of alpha, dense, and lysosomal granules from platelets plays important roles in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory processes. Alpha granules contain soluble proteins (e.g. von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen) and membrane-associated proteins (e.g. P-selectin and integrins αIIb and β3) that propagate platelet adhesion and aggregation (1Blair P. Flaumenhaft R. Platelet α-granules: Basic biology and clinical correlates.Blood Rev. 2009; 23 (19450911): 177-18910.1016/j.blre.2009.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Dense granules store ADP, a key autocrine and paracrine agonist for platelet activation, and other small molecules (e.g. serotonin and ATP) (2Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B.

SNARE proteins on the secretory granule membrane (vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)) and plasma membrane (syntaxin (Stx) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25)) form a highly stable coiled-coil structure (trans-SNARE complex) that pulls apposing membranes together during fusion (4Chen Y.A.

Mutations in the gene encoding Munc18-2 cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 5 (FHL-5), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an inflammatory response mediated by T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages (19Pagel J.

Platelets from a biallelic and a heterozygous FHL-5 patient had severe and intermediate exocytic defects, respectively, suggesting that Munc18-2 is a limiting factor in platelet secretion (20Al Hawas R.

We investigated the role of all three Munc18 paralogs in platelet secretion and platelet-dependent pathophysiology. Although the absence of Munc18-1 or Munc18-3 had no effects on exocytosis, the lack of Munc18-2 suppressed the release of alpha, dense, and lysosomal platelet granules almost completely, impairing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in vitro. Finally, using megakaryocyte-specific KO mice, we proved that Munc18-2 in platelets, and not in other tissues, is required for venous and arterial hemostasis and for arterial thrombosis. By RT-qPCR, we found that C57BL/6J platelets express transcripts for Munc18-1, -2, and -3. Munc18-2 was the most abundant (Fig. 1A). To study the role of these proteins in platelet exocytosis and function, we selectively deleted their genes in megakaryocytes using the Cre-loxP system. We used conditional KO mice for the three genes (17Gutierrez B.A. Chavez M.A. Rodarte A.I. Ramos M.A. Dominguez A. Petrova Y. Davalos A.J. Costa R.M. Elizondo R. Tuvim M.J. Dickey B.F. Burns A.R.

Immunoblots of tissues and platelets confirmed that platelets express the three Munc18 proteins (Fig. 1B). They also showed that mice carrying alleles flanked by two loxP sequences (“floxed” or F/F) and WT controls (+/+) expressed similar levels of each Munc18 protein. Finally, all three Δ/Δ mouse lines lacked expression of the targeted Munc18 protein only in platelets, whereas its expression in other tissues was comparable with that of the corresponding F/F littermates. To study how different Munc18 proteins contribute to platelet granule secretion, we assessed exocytosis of each type of platelet granule. We measured the release of ATP (dense granules) and the translocation of P-selectin (alpha granules) and LAMP-1 (lysosomal granules) to the plasma membrane upon platelet activation. We stimulated platelets with a low and high dose of thrombin as described previously (25Cardenas E.I. Breaux K. Da Q. Flores J.R. Ramos M.A. Tuvim M.J. Burns A.R. Rumbaut R.E. Adachi R. Platelet Munc13–4 regulates hemostasis, thrombosis and airway inflammation.Haematologica. 2018; 103 (29674495): 1235-124410.3324/haematol.2017.185637Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We observed that Munc18-2 deletion severely impaired exocytosis of dense, alpha, and lysosomal granules (Fig. 2, D–F, and Figs. S1 and S2). The signal for our three markers of exocytosis was barely detectable even with high-dose stimulation. Munc18-2 heterozygote platelets had a minor exocytic defect that failed to reach statistical significance. Platelets lacking Munc18-1 or Munc18-3 showed no exocytic defects (Fig. 2, A–C and G–I). We did not test exocytosis in platelets from heterozygote Munc18-1 and -3 mice given that full deletion did not produce a secretory phenotype. For the same reason, we opted not to study any Munc18-1 and Munc18-3 mutants in subsequent functional experiments. We confirmed the failure in alpha granule release in platelets lacking Munc18-2 by measuring the secretion of a soluble granule content, PF4 (platelet factor 4), instead of translocation of a membrane protein (P-selectin) (Fig. 3, B and C). Given the severe exocytic defect observed in thrombin-stimulated Munc18-2–deficient platelets, we decided to assess potential agonist dependence by studying exocytosis in response to a different stimulus. We measured the secretion of ATP (dense granules) and PF4 (alpha granules) following collagen stimulation and found that the deletion of Munc18-2 impaired their release (Fig. 3, A and B). Alterations in ADP release from dense granules can indirectly affect the exocytosis of other platelet granules (25Cardenas E.I. Breaux K. Da Q. Flores J.R. Ramos M.A. Tuvim M.J. Burns A.R. Rumbaut R.E. Adachi R. Platelet Munc13–4 regulates hemostasis, thrombosis and airway inflammation.Haematologica. 2018; 103 (29674495): 1235-124410.3324/haematol.2017.185637Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To test whether the defects observed in alpha and lysosomal granule exocytosis from Munc18-2Δ/Δ platelets was indirect, we added exogenous ADP to the stimulated platelets and found that it could rescue neither the secretion of PF4 (Fig. 3, B and C) nor the translocation of P-selectin (Fig. 3D) or LAMP-1 (Fig. 3E). A summary of all secretion assays is presented in Table S1. To rule out the possibility that the abnormal secretion observed in platelets lacking Munc18-2 was secondary to an impairment in platelet granule formation, we analyzed the resting platelets by electron microscopy (EM) (Fig. 4A, top row). Morphologic analysis of unstimulated platelets revealed no differences in the volume densities and surface densities of alpha or dense granules among all genotypes (Fig. 4, B–D). Assuming that most granules are almost spherical, the simultaneous stability of these two stereology values indicates that there are no changes in the number or size of granules (26Schneider J.P. Ochs M. Stereology of the lung.Methods Cell Biol. 2013; 113 (23317906): 257-29410.1016/B978-0-12-407239-8.00012-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Rodarte E.M. Ramos M.A. Davalos A.J.

We then used EM and stereology on stimulated platelets to confirm morphometrically what we had found in our secretion assays. Qualitatively, we observed the characteristic shape changes associated with platelet activation after exposure to thrombin in all genotypes (Fig. 4A, bottom row). Quantitatively, the volume density of the alpha and dense granules was expected to decrease as a result of the loss of granules through exocytosis following stimulation. However, Munc18-2–deficient platelets lost almost no alpha (Fig. 4B) or dense (Fig. 4C) granules. Once again, Munc18-2 heterozygote platelets showed no defect in degranulation. To determine how the absence of Munc18-2 would affect platelet function, we first studied platelet aggregation. Interestingly, platelets not expressing Munc18-2 could form aggregates only when a high dose of collagen was used (Fig. 5, A and B). The flat aggregometry recordings indicate that Munc18-2–deficient platelets do not even undergo shape changes when stimulated with a low dose of collagen. We then assessed platelet behavior under shear stress in a collagen-coated flow chamber using fluorescently labeled whole blood. We observed a marked difference in the rise of fluorescence in samples from Munc18-2Δ/Δ mice, indicating a severe defect in thrombus formation in Munc18-2–deficient platelets independent of the degree of shear stress employed (Fig. 5, C–F). The slight rise in the fluorescence signal from Munc18-2Δ/Δ samples, which is better seen using a different scale (Fig. S3), corresponds to the binding of platelets to the layer of collagen. We used two tail bleeding tests to study hemostasis. Using the classic transection model, which depends largely on arterial bleeding, we found that all of the Munc18-2Δ/Δ mice could not stop bleeding and had to be euthanized after 20 min (Fig. 6A). We then used a device we had described previously that reproducibly makes a 0.8-mm–deep dorsal cut at the level where the mouse tail is 3.8 mm in diameter (25Cardenas E.I. Breaux K. Da Q. Flores J.R.

Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and stopped-flow kinetics, we examined the reactive form of 2-KPCC and its single turnover reactions with a suicide substrate and CO2. The reductive half-reaction of 2-KPCC was kinetically and spectroscopically similar to that of a typical DSOR, GSH reductase, in which the active-site histidine had been replaced with an alanine. However, the reduced, reactive form of 2-KPCC was distinct from those typical DSORs. In the absence of the histidine, the flavin and disulfide moieties were no longer coupled via a covalent or charge transfer interaction as in typical DSORs. Similar to thioredoxins, the pKa between 7.5 and 8.1 that controls reactivity appeared to be due to a single proton shared between the cysteines of the dithiol, which effectively stabilizes the attacking cysteine sulfide and renders it capable of breaking the strong C–S bond of the substrate. The lack of a histidine protected 2-KPCC’s reactive intermediate from unwanted protonation; however, without its input as a catalytic acid–base, the oxidative half-reaction where carboxylation takes place was remarkably slow, limiting the overall reaction rate. We conclude that stringent regulation of protons in the DSOR active site supports C–S bond cleavage and selectivity for CO2 fixation.

Reithinger J. Holgado A. Maojun Y. Hammed A. Mattle D. Kim H. Nilsson I. Refined topology model of the STT3/Stt3 protein subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex.J. Biol.

To be able to investigate the topology of the 1302-residue-long and heavily glycosylated Astn1 protein, we selected to work with various truncated versions of the full-length protein. This was necessary because in vitro translation of such large proteins is inefficient and because attachment of an oligosaccharide increases the size of the protein by only 2–3 kDa, a shift that is too small to be detectable by SDS-PAGE for the full-length protein but can easily be visualized when using truncated versions. Truncated versions of Astn1 were expressed in vitro using the TnT® SP6 Quick Coupled System supplemented with column-washed dog pancreas RMs (14Cuviello F. Tellgren-Roth Å. Lara P. Ruud Selin F.

The glycosylation status was investigated using SDS-PAGE, and truncated Astn1 versions were designed so that differences in glycosylation patterns could be used to infer the topology of the protein in the RM membrane. Astn1 1–381, a version that extends from the putative SP to the end of the loop between TMH1 and TMH2, receives a single glycan when translated in the presence of RMs (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Notably, there is no sign of the SP being cleaved (which would reduce the molecular mass of the protein by 2.6 kDa). Astn1 78–381 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4) and Astn1 78–451 (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6) also receive only a single glycan, whereas Astn1 78–470 (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8) is glycosylated on two sites (note that glycan acceptor sites are rarely, if ever, modified to 100% in the in vitro translation system; hence, molecules with both one and two added glycans are visible on the gel). The second glycan addition, therefore, must be on Asn453. To determine whether the first glycan addition is on Asn115 or Asn226 (Asn328 is too close to TMH2 to be reached by the OST (22Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. Determination of the distance between the oligosaccharyltransferase active site and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (8449946): 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), we expressed Astn1 versions lacking the entire N-terminal region, up to but not including TMH2 (Fig. 2B). The two shorter versions were not glycosylated at all when expressed in the presence of RMs, whereas Astn1 160–470 was modified on a single glycosylation site. The latter must be Asn453, showing that neither Asn226 nor Asn328 becomes glycosylated. We conclude that the putative SP in Astn1 appears not to be cleaved by signal peptidase and probably forms an N-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH0) and that Astn1 has two segments (residues 22–152 and 402–1302) exposed to the lumen of the RMs and one segment (residues 174–380) exposed to the cytosol. Further, because Asn115 is glycosylated in all four constructs, it appears that the N-terminal segment in the Astn1 constructs that start at Met78 can be translocated to the lumenal side of the RMs even though it lacks the putative SP. We further used a protease protection assay (21Lara P. Öjemalm K. Reithinger J. Holgado A. Maojun Y. Hammed A. Mattle D. Kim H. Nilsson I. Refined topology model of the STT3/Stt3 protein subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex.J. Biol.

So that segments of Astn1 that are protected from proteinase digestion by the RM membrane would be of a convenient size for SDS-PAGE separation, we first expressed Astn1 78–728. The protein becomes glycosylated (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2), but it is difficult to determine on how many sites. Interestingly, two prominent bands at ∼38 kDa (marked N) and ∼36 kDa (marked C) were generated in the presence of RMs (Fig. 2C, lane 2), suggesting internal endoproteolytic cleavage, in agreement with the published Edman sequencing results that identified a cleavage site between Ser401 and Ser402 (11Chang H. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Nathans J. Intramembrane proteolysis of astrotactins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28100779): 3506-351610.1074/jbc.M116.768077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, a third band at ∼65 kDa that appears to receive a single glycan in the presence of RMs was also seen (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). The latter would be consistent with internal translation initiation at Met160 and indeed comigrates with Astn1 160–728 (Fig. 2C, lane 4). Proteinase K treatment of RMs carrying Astn1 78–728 digests cytoplasmically accessible parts of the protein and leaves only two protected fragments: one of identical size to the “endoproteolytic” 36-kDa band and one at ∼39 kDa (Fig. 2C, lane 3). The two protease-protected fragments are precisely what would be expected from the topology derived from the glycosylation study; the 39-kDa band (marked C*) represents fragment 381–728, generated when proteinase K digests the cytosolic loop, and the 36-kDa band represents the slightly smaller C-terminal fragment 402–728, generated by endoproteolytic cleavage near the C-terminal end of TMH2. The expected protected N-terminal fragment 78–181 is too small to be resolved on the gel. Similar results were obtained for Astn1 160–728. In addition to the full-length protein at ∼65 kDa, two bands at ∼36 kDa (marked C) and ∼25 kDa (marked N) were seen in the presence of RMs (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 5 and 6); Endo-H treatment shifted both the full-length band at ∼65 kDa and the ∼36 kDa band to a lower molecular mass, whereas the 25-kDa band did not shift (Fig. 2C, lane 8). Consistent with the Astn1 160–728 results, the glycosylated, ∼36-kDa band represents the same endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment 402–728, whereas the unglycosylated 25-kDa band represents the N-terminal endoproteolytic fragment 160–401. Given the sequence context of the endoproteolytic cleavage site (see “Discussion”), we hypothesized that the responsible protease may be a signal peptidase. Indeed, inclusion of a signal peptidase inhibitor (23Green N. Fang H. Miles S. Lively M.O. Dalbey R.E. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Cambridge, MA2002: 57-75Google Scholar) in the in vitro translation of Astn1 160–728 completely inhibits formation of the ∼36-kDa and ∼25-kDa products (Fig. 2C, lane 11). We conclude that Astn1 has the same topology as proposed previously for Astn2; namely, with two lumenal domains (residues 22–152 and 173–1302) and one cytosolic domain (residues 174–381). The putative SP appears not to be cleaved but, rather, forms an N-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH0). We identify signal peptidase as the enzyme responsible for the endoproteolytic cleavage event at Ser401. We used the same glycosylation mapping approach to determine the topology of the 1300-amino-acid-long mouse Astn2 protein (splice isoform 3, lacking exon 4, which encodes a 52-residue segment in the domain between TMH1 and TMH2). Astn2 1–482 includes both the putative SP, the two predicted transmembrane helices TMH1 and TMH2, and a portion of the large C-terminal domain. A small amount of glycosylated full-length product at ∼56 kDa, two weak bands at ∼50 kDa that might represent glycosylated and unglycosylated products lacking the SP (which has a calculated molecular mass of 6.4 kDa), and a prominent product at ∼43 kDa are seen in the presence of RMs (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 4, and 5). The latter is sensitive to Endo-H digestion, and the two bands at ∼50 kDa collapse to the lower-molecular-mass form upon the same treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 6). The glycosylated 43-kDa band fits the molecular mass expected for a product resulting from removal of the signal peptide (residues 1–51) and the endoproteolytic cleavage at Asn413 observed by Edman sequencing (11Chang H. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Nathans J. Intramembrane proteolysis of astrotactins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28100779): 3506-351610.1074/jbc.M116.768077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (note that we use a different splice version of Astn2 that lacks 52 residues in the cytosolic segment compared with the one used in this reference). This explains the limited amount of glycosylated full-length product (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 4, and 5) because most of the molecules that become glycosylated are cleaved after the SP and/or TMH2, as seen in Fig. 3A, lane 6. To confirm this interpretation, we also analyzed Astn2 161–482, which lacks the putative SP. Astn2 161–482 yields four prominent bands when expressed in the presence of RMs (Fig. 3B, lane 2): unglycosylated full-length product at ∼37 kDa, singly and doubly glycosylated full-length products at ∼39 kDa and ∼42 kDa, and a smaller endoproteolytic product at ∼35 kDa. Endo-H treatment collapses the ∼39-kDa and ∼42-kDa bands to the size of the unmodified full-length product at ∼37 kDa and the ∼35-kDa band to a smaller, ∼30-kDa band (Fig. 3B, lane 5). Similar to Astn1, addition of the signal peptidase inhibitor to the in vitro translation completely inhibits formation of the ∼35-kDa endoproteolytic product (Fig. 3B, lane 3), and the signal peptidase inhibitor plus Endo-H treatment of RM-integrated Astn2 161–482 leaves only the unmodified full-length product (Fig. 3B, lane 7; for unknown reasons, the signal peptidase inhibitor makes bands run slightly higher in the gel). These results are entirely consistent with the proposed topology of Astn2 (11Chang H. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Nathans J. Intramembrane proteolysis of astrotactins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28100779): 3506-351610.1074/jbc.M116.768077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and identify signal peptidase as the enzyme responsible for the endoproteolytic cleavage event at Asn413. Earlier work using epitope mapping of Astn2 expressed in COS7 cells has shown that the N and C termini are exposed on the cell surface, whereas the domain between TMH1 and TMH2 can only be immunodecorated in detergent-permeabilized cells (11Chang H. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Nathans J. Intramembrane proteolysis of astrotactins.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28100779): 3506-351610.1074/jbc.M116.768077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Further, both Astn1 and Astn2 have been shown to be cleaved by an unknown endoprotease into an N- and a C-terminal fragment, and Edman sequencing of the C-terminal fragments identified cleavage sites between Ser401-Ser402 in Astn1 and Gly465-Asn466 in Astn2, just after TMH2. In addition, for Astn2, Edman sequencing of the N-terminal endoproteolytic fragment indicated removal of the putative SP (residues 1–51); no sequence was obtained for Astn1, leaving open whether the putative SP is cleaved in this protein. Here we confirmed and extended these results for Astn1 and Astn2 using glycosylation mapping and protease protection assays in a coupled in vitro transcription–translation system supplemented with RMs. Our results for Astn2 are in perfect agreement with those from the earlier study; Astn2 has a cleaved N-terminal SP, an N-terminal domain located in the lumen of the RM (topologically equivalent to the extracellular surface in cells), two TMHs, and a large C-terminal lumenal domain (Fig. 4). We found that Astn1 has the same topology as Astn2 but saw no evidence of SP cleavage; rather, it seems that the putative N-terminal SP in Astn1 remains a part of the protein, presumably forming a third transmembrane helix (TMH0). We further show that an inhibitor of the signal peptidase complex completely inhibits the endoproteolytic cleavage of both Astn1 and Astn2. The unknown endoprotease involved in the maturation of Astn1 and Astn2 is thus signal peptidase, the enzyme that cleaves SPs from secretory and membrane proteins in the ER (24Nyathi Y. Wilkinson B.M. Pool M.R. Co-translational targeting and translocation of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833 (23481039): 2392-240210.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.02.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although it is uncommon that signal peptidase catalyzes internal cleavage reactions of this kind in cellular proteins, many viral polyproteins mature through signal peptidase–catalyzed cleavages after internal hydrophobic segments in the primary translation product (25Liljeström P. Garoff H. Internally located cleavable signal sequences direct the formation of Semliki forest virus membrane proteins from a polyprotein precursor.J. Virol. 1991; 65 (1985194): 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pène V. Lemasson M. Harper F. Pierron G. Rosenberg A.R.

Indeed, the SP cleavage site and the cleavage site after TMH2 identified by Edman sequencing in Astn2 are precisely the ones predicted by the SignalP server (27Petersen T.N. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 (21959131): 785-78610.1038/nmeth.1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (7096) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). These findings raise the possibility that higher levels of SP-mediated cleavage of Astn2 relative to Astn1 explain the higher levels of the Astn1 C terminus we detected previously on central nervous system neuronal surface membranes by antibody labeling and functional assays (6Horn Z. Behesti H. Hatten M.E. N-cadherin provides a cis and trans ligand for astrotactin that functions in glial-guided neuronal migration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This also likely contributes to the apparently distinct functions of Astn1 as a membrane adhesion receptor that functions in glial-guided migration (3Edmondson J.C. Liem R.K. Kuster J.E. Hatten M.E.

Finally, the exceptionally long Astn2 SP hints at the possibility that, after cleavage, the SP may have additional functions in the cell, as seen for many other very long SPs (28Kapp K. Schrempf S. Lemberg M.K. Dobberstein B. Zimmermann R. Protein Transport into the Endoplasmic Reticulum. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2009: 1-11Google Scholar). It will therefore be of interest to determine whether the Astn2 SP domain functions in receptor trafficking or planar polarity signaling pathways.

The DNA was then transferred to the pGEMI vector (Promega) at XbaI/SmaI sites together with a preceding Kozak sequence (29Kozak M.

Along with the exponential growth of number of published literatures, it is more and more difficult for ecologists to get a clear picture of their discipline. Nevertheless, the era of big data has brought us massive information of well documented historical literature and various techniques of data processing, which greatly facilitates the implementation of bibliometric analysis on ecology. Frequency has long been used as the primary metric in keyword analysis to detect ecological hotspots, however, this method could be somewhat biased. In our study, we have suggested a method called PAFit to measure keyword popularity, which considered ecology-related topics in a large temporal dynamical knowledge network, and found out the popularity of ecological topics follows the “rich get richer” and “fit get richer” mechanism. Feasibility of network analysis and its superiority over simply using frequency had been explored and justified, and PAFit was testified by its outstanding performance of prediction on the growth of frequency and degree. In addition, our research also encourages ecologists to consider their domain knowledge in a large dynamical network, and be ready to participate in interdisciplinary collaborations when necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2795524543,"During development of biological organisms, multiple complex structures are formed. In many instances, these structures need to exhibit a high degree of order to be functional, although many of their constituents are intrinsically stochastic. Hence, it has been suggested that biological robustness ultimately must rely on complex gene regulatory networks and clean-up mechanisms. Here we explore developmental processes that have evolved inherent robustness against stochasticity. In the context of the Drosophila eye disc, multiple optical units, ommatidia, develop into crystal-like patterns. During the larva-to-pupa stage of metamorphosis, the centers of the ommatidia are specified initially through the diffusion of morphogens, followed by the specification of R8 cells. Establishing the R8 cell is crucial in setting up the geometric, and functional, relationships of cells within an ommatidium and among neighboring ommatidia. Here we study an PDE mathematical model of these spatio-temporal processes in the presence of parametric stochasticity, defining and applying measures that quantify order within the resulting spatial patterns. We observe a universal sigmoidal response to increasing transcriptional noise. Ordered patterns persist up to a threshold noise level in the model parameters. In accordance with prior qualitative observations, as the noise is further increased past a threshold point of no return, these ordered patterns rapidly become disordered. Such robustness in development allows for the accumulation of genetic variation without any observable changes in phenotype. We argue that the observed sigmoidal dependence introduces robustness allowing for sizable amounts of genetic variation and transcriptional noise to be tolerated in natural populations without resulting in phenotype variation."
