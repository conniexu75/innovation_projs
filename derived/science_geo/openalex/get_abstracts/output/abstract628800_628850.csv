https://openalex.org/W2916458303,"Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that resides within a complex microenvironment, complicating efforts to understand how different cell types contribute to disease progression. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and genotyping to profile 38,410 cells from 40 bone marrow aspirates, including 16 AML patients and five healthy donors. We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. Cell type compositions correlated with prototypic genetic lesions, including an association of FLT3-ITD with abundant progenitor-like cells. Primitive AML cells exhibited dysregulated transcriptional programs with co-expression of stemness and myeloid priming genes and had prognostic significance. Differentiated monocyte-like AML cells expressed diverse immunomodulatory genes and suppressed T cell activity in vitro. In conclusion, we provide single-cell technologies and an atlas of AML cell states, regulators, and markers with implications for precision medicine and immune therapies. Video Abstract"

Although effective genetic labeling approaches are available in model systems, in humans, most approaches require detection of nuclear somatic mutations, which have high error rates, limited scale, and do not capture cell state information. Here, we show that somatic mutations in mtDNA can be tracked by single-cell RNA or assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing. We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their utility as highly accurate clonal markers to infer cellular relationships. We track native human cells both in vitro and in vivo and relate clonal dynamics to gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow clonal tracking at a 1,000-fold greater scale than with nuclear genome sequencing, with simultaneous information on cell state, opening the way to chart cellular dynamics in human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2915988618,"The function of somatic stem cells declines with age. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of this decline is key to counteract age-related disease. Here, we report a dramatic drop in the neural stem cells (NSCs) number in the aging murine brain. We find that this smaller stem cell reservoir is protected from full depletion by an increase in quiescence that makes old NSCs more resistant to regenerate the injured brain. Once activated, however, young and old NSCs show similar proliferation and differentiation capacity. Single-cell transcriptomics of NSCs indicate that aging changes NSCs minimally. In the aging brain, niche-derived inflammatory signals and the Wnt antagonist sFRP5 induce quiescence. Indeed, intervention to neutralize them increases activation of old NSCs during homeostasis and following injury. Our study identifies quiescence as a key feature of old NSCs imposed by the niche and uncovers ways to activate NSCs to repair the aging brain."

However, the detection of naturally invisible near-infrared (NIR) light is a desirable ability. To break this limitation, we developed ocular injectable photoreceptor-binding upconversion nanoparticles (pbUCNPs). These nanoparticles anchored on retinal photoreceptors as miniature NIR light transducers to create NIR light image vision with negligible side effects. Based on single-photoreceptor recordings, electroretinograms, cortical recordings, and visual behavioral tests, we demonstrated that mice with these nanoantennae could not only perceive NIR light, but also see NIR light patterns. Excitingly, the injected mice were also able to differentiate sophisticated NIR shape patterns. Moreover, the NIR light pattern vision was ambient-daylight compatible and existed in parallel with native daylight vision. This new method will provide unmatched opportunities for a wide variety of emerging bio-integrated nanodevice designs and applications. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2916856097,"The presence of DNA in the cytosol of mammalian cells is an unusual event that is often associated with genotoxic stress or viral infection. The enzyme cGAS is a sensor of cytosolic DNA that induces interferon and inflammatory responses that can be protective or pathologic, depending on the context. Along with other cytosolic innate immune receptors, cGAS is thought to diffuse throughout the cytosol in search of its DNA ligand. Herein, we report that cGAS is not a cytosolic protein but rather localizes to the plasma membrane via the actions of an N-terminal phosphoinositide-binding domain. This domain interacts selectively with PI(4,5)P2, and cGAS mutants defective for lipid binding are mislocalized to the cytosolic and nuclear compartments. Mislocalized cGAS induces potent interferon responses to genotoxic stress, but weaker responses to viral infection. These data establish the subcellular positioning of a cytosolic innate immune receptor as a mechanism that governs self-nonself discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2919275655,"Receptor clustering on the cell membrane is critical in the signaling of many immunoreceptors, and this mechanism has previously been attributed to the extracellular and/or the intracellular interactions. Here, we report an unexpected finding that for death receptor 5 (DR5), a receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, the transmembrane helix (TMH) alone in the receptor directly assembles a higher-order structure to drive signaling and that this structure is inhibited by the unliganded ectodomain. Nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the TMH in bicelles shows distinct trimerization and dimerization faces, allowing formation of dimer-trimer interaction networks. Single-TMH mutations that disrupt either trimerization or dimerization abolish ligand-induced receptor activation. Surprisingly, proteolytic removal of the DR5 ectodomain can fully activate downstream signaling in the absence of ligand. Our data suggest a receptor activation mechanism in which binding of ligand or antibodies to overcome the pre-ligand autoinhibition allows TMH clustering and thus signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2920477154,"Aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein) are a hallmark of the overlapping neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. The process of TDP-43 aggregation remains poorly understood, and whether it includes formation of intermediate complexes is unknown. Here, we analyzed aggregates derived from purified TDP-43 under semidenaturing conditions, identifying distinct oligomeric complexes at the initial time points before the formation of large aggregates. We found that this early oligomerization stage is primarily driven by TDP-43's RNA-binding region. Specific binding to GU-rich RNA strongly inhibited both TDP-43 oligomerization and aggregation, suggesting that RNA interactions are critical for maintaining TDP-43 solubility. Moreover, we analyzed TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation and detected similar detergent-resistant oligomers upon maturation of liquid droplets into solid-like fibrils. These results strongly suggest that the oligomers form during the early steps of TDP-43 misfolding. Importantly, the ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations A315T and M337V significantly accelerate aggregation, rapidly decreasing the monomeric population and shortening the oligomeric phase. We also show that aggregates generated from purified TDP-43 seed intracellular aggregation detected by established TDP-43 pathology markers. Remarkably, cytoplasmic aggregate seeding was detected earlier for the A315T and M337V variants and was 50% more widespread than for WT TDP-43 aggregates. We provide evidence for an initial step of TDP-43 self-assembly into intermediate oligomeric complexes, whereby these complexes may provide a scaffold for aggregation. This process is altered by ALS-linked mutations, underscoring the role of perturbations in TDP-43 homeostasis in protein aggregation and ALS-FTD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2918205890,"DNA rearrangements resulting in human genome structural variants (SVs) are caused by diverse mutational mechanisms. We used long- and short-read sequencing technologies to investigate end products of de novo chromosome 17p11.2 rearrangements and query the molecular mechanisms underlying both recurrent and non-recurrent events. Evidence for an increased rate of clustered single-nucleotide variant (SNV) mutation in cis with non-recurrent rearrangements was found. Indel and SNV formation are associated with both copy-number gains and losses of 17p11.2, occur up to ∼1 Mb away from the breakpoint junctions, and favor C > G transversion substitutions; results suggest that single-stranded DNA is formed during the genesis of the SV and provide compelling support for a microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) mechanism for SV formation. Our data show an additional mutational burden of MMBIR consisting of hypermutation confined to the locus and manifesting as SNVs and indels predominantly within genes."
https://openalex.org/W2951313775,"Foraging strategies emerge from genetically encoded programs that are similar across animal species. Here, we examine circuits that control a conserved foraging state, local search behavior after food removal, in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that local search is triggered by two parallel groups of chemosensory and mechanosensory glutamatergic neurons that detect food-related cues. Each group of sensory neurons suppresses distinct integrating neurons through a G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor, MGL-1, to release local search. The chemosensory and mechanosensory modules are separate and redundant; glutamate release from either module can drive the full behavior. A transition from local search to global search over several minutes after food removal is associated with two changes in circuit function. First, the spontaneous activity of sensory neurons falls. Second, the motor pattern generator for local search becomes less responsive to sensory input. This multimodal, distributed short-term food memory provides robust control of an innate behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2920743482,"Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a ubiquitous pathway for Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (PM). SOCE is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated Ca2+-sensing proteins stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and STIM2, which transition into an active conformation in response to ER Ca2+ store depletion, thereby interacting with and gating PM-associated ORAI1 channels. Although structurally homologous, STIM1 and STIM2 generate distinct Ca2+ signatures in response to varying strengths of agonist stimulation. The physiological functions of these Ca2+ signatures, particularly under native conditions, remain unclear. To investigate the structural properties distinguishing STIM1 and STIM2 activation of ORAI1 channels under native conditions, here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate STIM1−/−, STIM2−/−, and STIM1/2−/− knockouts in HEK293 and colorectal HCT116 cells. We show that depending on cell type, STIM2 can significantly sustain SOCE in response to maximal store depletion. Utilizing the SOCE modifier 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), we demonstrate that 2-APB–activated store-independent Ca2+ entry is mediated exclusively by endogenous STIM2. Using variants that either stabilize or disrupt intramolecular interactions of STIM C termini, we show that the increased flexibility of the STIM2 C terminus contributes to its selective store-independent activation by 2-APB. However, STIM1 variants with enhanced flexibility in the C terminus failed to support its store-independent activation. STIM1/STIM2 chimeric constructs indicated that coordination between N-terminal sensitivity and C-terminal flexibility is required for specific store-independent STIM2 activation. Our results clarify the structural determinants underlying activation of specific STIM isoforms, insights that are potentially useful for isoform-selective drug targeting.

https://openalex.org/W2908935617,"More than ever, technical inventions are the symbol of our society's advance. Patents guarantee their creators protection against infringement. For an invention being patentable, its novelty and inventiveness have to be assessed. Therefore, a search for published work that describes similar inventions to a given patent application needs to be performed. Currently, this so-called search for prior art is executed with semi-automatically composed keyword queries, which is not only time consuming, but also prone to errors. In particular, errors may systematically arise by the fact that different keywords for the same technical concepts may exist across disciplines. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed, where the full text of a given patent application is compared to existing patents using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to automatically detect inventions that are similar to the one described in the submitted document. Various state-of-the-art approaches for feature extraction and document comparison are evaluated. In addition to that, the quality of the current search process is assessed based on ratings of a domain expert. The evaluation results show that our automated approach, besides accelerating the search process, also improves the search results for prior art with respect to their quality."
https://openalex.org/W2918960992,"Fusion peptides (FPs) in spike proteins are key players mediating early events in cell-to-cell fusion, vital for intercellular viral spread. A proline residue located at the central FP region has often been suggested to have a distinctive role in this fusion event. The spike glycoprotein from strain RSA59 (PP) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains two central, consecutive prolines in the FP. Here, we report that deletion of one of these proline residues, resulting in RSA59 (P), significantly affected neural cell syncytia formation and viral titers postinfection in vitro. Transcranial inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice with RSA59 (PP) or RSA59 (P) yielded similar degrees of necrotizing hepatitis and meningitis, but only RSA59 (PP) produced widespread encephalitis that extended deeply into the brain parenchyma. By day 6 postinfection, both virus variants were mostly cleared from the brain. Interestingly, inoculation with the RSA59 (P)–carrying MHV significantly reduced demyelination at the chronic stage. We also found that the presence of two consecutive prolines in FP promotes a more ordered, compact, and rigid structure in the spike protein. These effects on FP structure were due to proline’s unique stereochemical properties intrinsic to its secondary amino acid structure, revealed by molecular dynamics and NMR experiments. We therefore propose that the differences in the severity of encephalitis and demyelination between RSA59 (PP) and RSA59 (P) arise from the presence or absence, respectively, of the two consecutive prolines in FP.

The fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane can lead to the entry of the viral genome either through pore formation or the internalization of the virus into the host cell following endocytosis. This process has been widely studied using mutagenesis (1Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R.

Viral FPs are typically short, apolar, and alanine/glycine-rich segments of the fusion protein, which are believed to participate in early events of the virus–host contact process (5Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Common properties of fusion peptides from diverse systems.Biosci. Rep. 2000; 20 (11426690): 483-50010.1023/A:1010454803579Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These polypeptides tend to show high amino acid residue conservation within a virus family but little similarity across families (1Durell S.R. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Shai Y. Blumenthal R.

It is often located adjacent to heptad repeats that preferentially interact with host lipid bilayers. Ideally, the FPs need to be membranotropic, yet in several cases they also include charged residues (2Earp L.J. Delos S.E. Park H.E. White J.M. The many mechanisms of viral membrane fusion proteins.Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285 (15609500): 25-66PubMed Google Scholar) and contain a proline residue at the center (6White J.M.

The specific role of proline in FP has been experimentally investigated through mutation studies in several viruses, such as avian sarcoma/leucosis virus (7Delos S.E. Gilbert J.M. White J.M. The central proline of an internal viral fusion peptide serves two important roles.J.

Interestingly, central proline-containing FPs are present across different classes of fusion proteins, although they are not conserved. This suggests that their role in the fusion process may be important but not always essential. Although FP or fusion protein sequences are largely conserved within virus species and strains, small variations impart diversity and complexity to the fusion process that makes residue contributions difficult to elucidate. For example, a central proline in the FP of spike glycoprotein of the betacoronavirus genus appears to carry a variety of fusion mechanisms. In the JHM strain of MHV, fusion and entry can occur directly at the cell surface, after either receptor binding or endocytosis or both (11Nash T.C. Buchmeier M.J. Entry of mouse hepatitis virus into cells by endosomal and nonendosomal pathways.Virology. 1997; 233 (9201212): 1-810.1006/viro.1997.8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on the strain of MHV and host cell type, the fusion mechanisms can differ and at times may appear distinct from each other, as observed in the case of MHV-A59 and MHV-2 (12Eifart P. Ludwig K. Böttcher C. de Haan C.A. Rottier P.J. Korte T. Herrmann A. Role of endocytosis and low pH in murine hepatitis virus strain A59 cell entry.J.

Herein, MHV-A59 with an H716D mutation in the spike protein was found to be deficient in cell–cell fusion due to cleavage impairment (14Leparc-Goffart I. Hingley S.T. Chua M.M. Jiang X. Lavi E. Weiss S.R. Altered pathogenesis of a mutant of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 is associated with a Q159L amino acid substitution in the spike protein.Virology. 1997; 239 (9426441): 1-1010.1006/viro.1997.8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The alteration of the cleavage site sequence in MHV-A59 (corresponding to the MHV-2 cleavage sequence) also delayed cell–cell fusion, whereas the MHV-2 strain spike itself may not be cleaved at all for fusion. Interestingly, the MHV-A59 spike protein derived from mouse liver homogenates was not found to be cleaved at all, suggesting that cleavage is not essential for entry and spread in vivo (15Hingley S.T. Leparc-Goffart I. Weiss S.R. The spike protein of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is not cleaved in primary glial cells and primary hepatocytes.J. Virol. 1998; 72 (9445064): 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even low pH, which can at times act as a trigger, does not show a consistent trend, as a cleavage-competent (cleavage site–engineered) MHV-2 spike protein has been shown to cause infection even at neutral pH (13Qiu Z. Hingley S.T. Simmons G. Yu C. Das Sarma J. Bates P. Weiss S.R. Endosomal proteolysis by cathepsins is necessary for murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 2 spike-mediated entry.J. Virol. 2006; 80 (16731916): 5768-577610.1128/JVI.00442-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two other mechanisms that are known to activate fusion through specific interactions with target cell receptors (like the most common CEACAM1 receptor) at neutral pH, or receptor priming at neutral pH followed by activation at a low pH, do not clarify the existing ambiguities regarding the precise combination of factors required to successfully initiate and drive each fusion process. Without knowledge of the exact combination of factors dominating a given fusion process, our understanding of this very important event remains incomplete, impairing our ability to fundamentally understand the origins of virus infection. In 1990, Chambers et al. (16Chambers P. Pringle C.R. Easton A.J. Heptad repeat sequences are located adjacent to hydrophobic regions in several types of virus fusion glycoproteins.J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71 (2177097): 3075-308010.1099/0022-1317-71-12-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) proposed an internal FP (residues 929–944) as a candidate fusion domain based on its hydrophobicity and location adjacent to the heptad repeat domains in the demyelinating strain (MHV-A59). Previous studies in MHV-A59 FP have shown that mutagenesis/substitution of the methionine residue at position 936 with lysine (M936K) or leucine (M936L) of the 929–944 domains did not affect fusion. However, whereas substitution of the proline residue at position 938 with lysine (P938K) partially impaired fusion, replacing the same proline residue with a leucine residue did not have any effect on fusion (17Luo Z. Weiss S.R. Roles in cell-to-cell fusion of two conserved hydrophobic regions in the murine coronavirus spike protein.Virology. 1998; 244 (9601516): 483-49410.1006/viro.1998.9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No studies are available to understand whether two consecutive proline residues play a role in demyelinating strain fusogenicity. We were interested in identifying the distinct role of the central proline in the fusion peptide and whether its insertion/deletion could alter the kinetics of the fusion process and consequent neuropathogenesis. Thus, we engineered an internal FP mutant of MHV in which one proline has been deleted from RSA59, an isogenic spike protein recombinant strain of MHV (engineered from the parental strain MHV-A59), which encodes a spike glycoprotein that is expressed on the virion envelope. Spike protein mediates many biological properties of MHV, including receptor attachment, virus cell fusion during entry, cell-to-cell fusion during viral spread, and immune activation (18Phillips J.J.

The original RSA59 strain FP contains two consecutive prolines and enhanced GFP (EGFP). For the control study, we used RSMHV2, an isogenic recombinant strain of MHV-A59 (background genes are from the demyelinating strain MHV-A59) except for the spike protein.

Table 1, Table 2 depict the nomenclature of all of the parental recombinant strains and mutant strains. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to check the alteration of viral entry, spread, and neuropathogenesis of each strain. These were combined with computational and structural biology studies on the FP and spike protein fusion domain to understand the specific role of proline in altering the fusion phenotype. The studies reveal why and to what extent a central proline in FP of MHV can alter the fusion determinant and pathogenesis and provide generic insight into factors that play an important role in this process. The findings also reveal a suitable system to expand the study of cellular mechanisms of MHV spread and pathogenesis. Our study helps to understand how specific amino acid mutations in FP may result in alterations of virus infectivity and whether this insight can be used for therapeutic purposes.Table 1Nomenclature of different parental strains, recombinant strains, and proline mutated strains of MHVMHV strainsDescriptionWT MHV-A59 (19Das Sarma J.

The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the S2 subunit contains an N-terminal FP, two heptad repeat domains (HR1 and HR2), a transmembrane domain (TM), and an intracellular cytoplasmic tail (IC) (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b illustrates the entire amino acid sequence alignment of the MHV-A59 and MHV2 S2 domains highlighting FP and the cleavage signal site. Alignment of the full-length protein is shown in Fig. S1. RSA59 (PP) and RSMHV2 (P) both could infect Neuro2A (N2a), but they differed significantly in their cytopathic/fusogenic properties, as revealed by the size, rate, and degree of syncytial formation (Fig. 1c). Upon RSA59 (PP) infection, N2a cells started to fuse as early as 12 h (data not shown) and formed profuse syncytia, which commenced to increase with time until 24 h. At 24 h postinfection (p.i.), most of the giant syncytia started to dissolve, as all of the infected cells had lysed. In contrast, RSMHV2 (P)–infected individual cells rarely formed syncytia even after 24 h p.i. The experiments were repeated five times under the same conditions. In coronaviruses, the spike protein alone can traffic to the cell surface and is sufficient for the induction of cell-to-cell fusion (17Luo Z. Weiss S.R. Roles in cell-to-cell fusion of two conserved hydrophobic regions in the murine coronavirus spike protein.Virology. 1998; 244 (9601516): 483-49410.1006/viro.1998.9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Luo Z.L.

Biol. 1998; 440 (9782260): 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, we questioned what differences therein could lead to altered fusion between RSA59 (PP) and RSMHV2 (P). The overall organization of the primary structure of spike proteins is shown in Fig. S1. Against the background of the 81% identical primary structure of S-MHV-A59 (PP) (spike protein of MHV-A59) and S-MHV-2 (P) (spike protein of MHV2), alterations were restricted to a 43-residue insertion in S-MHV-2 (P) between residues 496 and 538, another 3-residue deletion between residues 565 and 567 and between residues 901 and 902, and a single residue deletion at position 977. Interestingly, the 43-residue insertion was conserved in 23 other coronaviruses (including human coronavirus), and the degree of conservation varied, with cysteine being the most conserved residue, suggesting that it was more likely a deletion from S-MHV-A59 (PP) than an insertion in S-MHV-2 (P). There were no contrasting substitutions in the alignment, with only 11 substitutions from the fusion domain (all non-Gly and isolated mutations), with a deletion at amino acids 901 and 902 outside the heptad regions and unlikely to participate in any early fusion events (also verified from the structural model). Interestingly, the internal FPs for S-MHV-A59 (PP) (residues 929–952, TGATAAAMFPPWSAAAGVPFSLSV) and for S-MHV-2 (P) (residues 967–989, AGATVSAMFPWSAAAGVPFSLSV) were found to be 87.5% identical, excluding the proline deletion (Fig. 2a). The examination of the quaternary structure of the fusion domain of S-MHV-A59 (PP) obtained by cryo-EM (PDB code 3JCL) (24Walls A.C. Tortorici M.A. Bosch B.J. Frenz B. Rottier P.J.M. DiMaio F. Rey F.A. Veesler D. Cryo-electron microscopy structure of a coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer.Nature. 2016; 531 (26855426): 114-11710.1038/nature16988Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) showed an all α-helical structure for the fusion domain (Fig. 2b). The FP in the structure also had a segmented α-helical structure interspersed with two short loop regions (Fig. 2d). The comparative model for S-MHV-2 (P) showed similar features, although the orientations of the helices in the tertiary structures were such that they are not identically aligned (Fig. 2, c and e). Therefore, the structural role of the central proline appeared to be distinctive, with potential to distinguish the fusion activity of the two FPs; thus, it was investigated in more detail through molecular dynamics simulation and NMR studies. Significant differences were observed between the energy landscapes obtained from equilibrium MD of the fusion domain in the spike proteins from S-MHV-2 and S-MHV-A59 (Fig. 2f). The insertion or deletion of a single proline in FP was responsible for this change in dynamics of the fusion domain from S-MHV-2 (P), S-MHV-A59 (P), and S-MHV-A59 (PP). The insertion of proline tended to contract the overall conformational state space. Because mutant S-MHV-A59 (P) showed larger deviations in the RMSD and radius of gyration compared with WT S-MHV-A59 (PP), we concluded that the deletion of proline relaxed the fusion domain. The studied fusion domains were sufficiently large (3 × 245 residues) to ensure that the results were comparable with the equilibrium MD of full-length spike proteins. The dihedral fluctuation of the FP segment was suppressed whenever two consecutive prolines (PP) were present, in contrast to the presence of a single proline (P) in the chain (Fig. 3a). The mid-helical segment in FP (P) with a single proline had 20% or less helical occurrence in contrast to the FP in S-MHV-A59 (PP), where the equivalent segment had >90% occurrence of a helical conformation in the MD trajectory (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, the same segments showed an equally high helical occurrence (>90%) in methanol. The rigidity of the FP could be estimated from the hydrogen bond retention of proline in and around the FP (Table S1). For single-proline structures, the number of hydrogen bonds, as well as their occurrence, was low; in contrast, many bonds for diproline cases showed a >88% occurrence. These mainly corresponded to hydrogen bonding in the helix. The differential behavior of the FPs observed in the MD simulation arose from the basic stereochemistry of proline, limiting the allowed φ dihedral angles in the polypeptide backbone where it is located. To further investigate the same phenomenon, we studied a 16- and 24-residue segment of the FPs to understand their intrinsic behavior, with the caveat that these might not be reproducible when the FP was part of the full protein. The 1H-1H TOCSY NMR spectrum of the 16-residue FP showing a cross-peak between protons attached to Cα and N could be clearly attributed to two sets of conformers, one existing in cis and another in trans conformation (Fig. S2). The NOE cross-peak between Pro938 (P8) Hα and Pro939 (P9) Hδ confirmed that one of the peptides was in trans conformation (Fig. 4a and Fig. S3). The cis conformation was evidenced by a cross-peak between Pro938 (P8) Hα and Pro939 (P9) Hα (Fig. 4b). The presence of a cis-trans isomer in the polypeptide solution was also confirmed by the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum (Fig. S4). The cross-peak between Phe937 (F7) Hα and Pro938 (P8) Hδ"

Mining-induced voids, which provide passages for air leakage, are the key factor triggering spontaneous combustion of coal in longwall goafs. In this study, a comprehensive method, which combined pressure balance, grouting injection, and filling fissures, was proposed to prevent spontaneous combustion of coal in longwall goafs with complex air leakage. Field engineering practice was carried out in Sitai Coal Mine in China. The results demonstrated that with the application of the proposed method, in the working face, the concentration of CO was decreased from 31ppm to 0 and the air leakage quantity was decreased from 261 to below 80 m3min-1. The gas samples analysis from the gob areas also indicated that concentrations of O2 and CO were successively decreased, indicating that the risk of spontaneous combustion of coal in goafs was eliminated. The above mentioned analysis indicates that, the method proposed in this study is useful and efficient. Successful application of this technology could provide reference for the treatment of other coal mines."
https://openalex.org/W2920781917,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infection poses a serious health threat and novel antiviral strategies are needed. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) can be generated in IAV infected cells due to errors of the viral polymerase and may suppress spread of wild type (wt) virus. The antiviral activity of DIPs is exerted by a DI genomic RNA segment that usually contains a large deletion and suppresses amplification of wt segments, potentially by competing for cellular and viral resources. DI-244 is a naturally occurring prototypic segment 1-derived DI RNA in which most of the PB2 open reading frame has been deleted and which is currently developed for antiviral therapy. At present, coinfection with wt virus is required for production of DI-244 particles which raises concerns regarding biosafety and may complicate interpretation of research results. Here, we show that cocultures of 293T and MDCK cell lines stably expressing codon optimized PB2 allow production of DI-244 particles solely from plasmids and in the absence of helper virus. Moreover, we demonstrate that infectivity of these particles can be quantified using MDCK-PB2 cells. Finally, we report that the DI-244 particles produced in this novel system exert potent antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV but not against the unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus. This is the first report of DIP production in the absence of infectious IAV and may spur efforts to develop DIPs for antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2919378444,"Site-specific suppressors of superoxide production (named S1QELs) in the quinone-reaction site in mitochondrial respiratory complex I during reverse electron transfer have been previously reported; however, their mechanism of action remains elusive. Using bovine heart submitochondrial particles, we herein investigated the effects of S1QELs on complex I functions. We found that the inhibitory effects of S1QELs on complex I are distinctly different from those of other known quinone-site inhibitors. For example, the inhibitory potencies of S1QELs significantly varied depending on the direction of electron transfer (forward or reverse). S1QELs marginally suppressed the specific chemical modification of Asp160 in the 49-kDa subunit, located deep in the quinone-binding pocket, by the tosyl chemistry reagent AL1. S1QELs also failed to suppress the binding of a photoreactive quinazoline-type inhibitor ([125I]AzQ) to the 49-kDa subunit. Moreover, a photoaffinity labeling experiment with photoreactive S1QEL derivatives indicated that they bind to a segment in the ND1 subunit that is not considered to make up the binding pocket for quinone or inhibitors. These results indicate that unlike known quinone-site inhibitors, S1QELs do not occupy the quinone- or inhibitor-binding pocket; rather, they may indirectly modulate the quinone-redox reactions by inducing structural changes of the pocket through binding to ND1. We conclude that this indirect effect may be a prerequisite for S1QELs' direction-dependent modulation of electron transfer. This, in turn, may be responsible for the suppression of superoxide production during reverse electron transfer without significantly interfering with forward electron transfer."

Hence, pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase might lead to the subsequent inhibition of Notch signaling in cancer cells. In search of novel γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), we screened a series of triazole-based compounds for their potential to bind γ-secretase and observed that 3-(3′4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)-5-(N-methyl-3′-indolyl)-1,2,4-triazole compound (also known as NMK-T-057) can bind to γ-secretase complex. Very interestingly, NMK-T-057 was found to inhibit proliferation, colony-forming ability, and motility in various breast cancer (BC) cells such as MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, 4T1 (triple-negative cells), and MCF-7 (estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)–positive cell line) with negligible cytotoxicity against noncancerous cells (MCF-10A and peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Furthermore, significant induction of apoptosis and inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness were also observed in NMK-T-057–treated BC cells. The in silico study revealing the affinity of NMK-T-057 toward γ-secretase was further validated by a fluorescence-based γ-secretase activity assay, which confirmed inhibition of γ-secretase activity in NMK-T-057–treated BC cells.

Inhibition of Notch signaling reduces the stem-like population of breast cancer cells and prevents mammosphere formation.Anticancer Res. 2010; 30 (21036696): 3853-3867PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Notch signaling requires the interaction between Notch receptor and its ligand Jagged-1 or Jagged-2 followed by a series of proteolytic cleavages. Notch receptors are transmembrane heterodimeric proteins consisting of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (17Guo S. Liu M. Gonzalez-Perez R.R. Role of Notch and its oncogenic signaling crosstalk in breast cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1815 (21193018): 197-21310.1016/j.bbcan.2010.12.002PubMed Google Scholar). The initial cleavage, or S1, of the Notch precursor is initiated in the Golgi network by a furin-like convertase to generate a heterodimeric receptor at the cell surface (23Borggrefe T. Oswald F. The Notch signaling pathway: transcriptional regulation at Notch target genes.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66 (19165418): 1631-164610.1007/s00018-009-8668-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Binding of Notch receptor to its ligands triggers the second, or S2, cleavage. This is catalyzed by a family of metalloendopeptidases known as ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) or TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α–converting enzyme), which cleaves the Notch receptor at an extracellular site (S2) between Ala (1710) and Val (1711) residues, thus releasing a fragment, known as Notch extracellular domain (24Zhang Y.W. Luo W.J. Wang H. Lin P. Vetrivel K.S. Liao F. Li F. Wong P.C. Farquhar M.G. Thinakaran G. Xu H.

The remaining receptor fragment then undergoes the third proteolytic cleavage (S3) by a membrane-bound protease known as γ-secretase complex to release the activated Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the cytosol (24Zhang Y.W. Luo W.J. Wang H. Lin P. Vetrivel K.S. Liao F. Li F. Wong P.C. Farquhar M.G. Thinakaran G. Xu H.

Presenilin is an aspartyl protease that forms the catalytic core, whereas Nicastrin is required for substrate recognition (24Zhang Y.W. Luo W.J. Wang H. Lin P. Vetrivel K.S. Liao F. Li F. Wong P.C.

The activated NICD then translocates to the nucleus and modulates the transcription of its downstream targets genes such as Hes-1, Hey-1, Akt, and PTEN (21Al-Hussaini H. Subramanyam D. Reedijk M. Sridhar S.S. Notch signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Mol.

Due to its important role in the activation of Notch signaling, γ-secretase complex has become a potential target for specific inhibitors, known as γ-secretase inhibitor (GSIs), which are reported to show significant anticancer properties against several carcinomas, including breast, and a few of them have also entered phase I and phase II clinical trials (26Schott A.F.

In search of novel GSIs, we investigated the Notch inhibitory properties of a triazole-based compound, 3-(3′4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)-5-(N-methyl-3′-indolyl)-1,2,4-triazole (also known as NMK-T-057), consisting of 1,2,4-triazole ring linked with an indole moiety (Fig. 1A). The presence of an indole ring system is known to attribute diverse medicinal and pharmacological properties to small molecules of both natural and synthetic origins (28de Sá Alves F.R. Barreiro E.J. Fraga C.A. From nature to drug discovery: the indole scaffold as a ’privileged structure’.Mini Rev. Med.

When the indole ring is linked with five-member heterocyclic triazoles, the resultant compounds have been reported to gain potent anticancer properties (29Kumar D. Narayanam M.K. Chang K.H. Shah K.

Moreover, available literature indicates that 1,2,4-triazole derivatives possess potent anticancer properties (29Kumar D. Narayanam M.K. Chang K.H. Shah K.

Hence, in the present study, we have investigated the anticancer mechanism of the novel indolyl triazole derivative NMK-T-057 against several breast cancer cell lines by monitoring different oncogenic parameters, including migratory properties, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and stemness. Because Notch signaling is known to be a regulator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness in BC (34Espinoza I. Miele L. Deadly crosstalk: Notch signaling at the intersection of EMT and cancer stem cells.Cancer Lett. 2013; 341 (23973264): 41-4510.1016/j.canlet.2013.08.027Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 35Suman S.

To delineate the specific mechanism of Notch inhibition by NMK-T-057, we monitored γ-secretase activity in NMK-treated cells. Furthermore, it has been reported that inhibition of Notch signaling leads to autophagic cell death in BC cells (36Ray A Vasudevan S Sengupta S. 6-Shogaol inhibits breast cancer cells and stem cell-like spheroids by modulation of Notch signaling pathway and induction of autophagic cell death.PLoS One. 2015; 10 (26355461)e013761410.1371/journal.pone.0137614Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Wang Y Wang H Ge H Yang Z.

Biochem. 2018; 119 (29575026): 5893-590310.1002/jcb.26781Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hence, we have also investigated whether inhibition of γ-secretase–mediated Notch activation by NMK-T-057 leads to autophagic cell death in BCs. Thus, the present study highlighted a very specific mechanism by which the triazole-based drugs can inhibit BC cells. Treatment of TNBC cells such as MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and 4T1 and non-TNBC cell type MCF-7 with NMK-T-057 for 24 h resulted in the loss of viability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). However, comparatively lesser cytotoxicity was observed when noncancerous cell types such as MCF-10A and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with NMK-T-057, with respective IC50 values >50 μm. Effects of NMK-T-057 on TNBCs such as MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and 4T1 cells were more or less similar, with the observed IC50 values ranging between 8 and 12 μm, whereas MCF-7 was found to be most susceptible to NMK-T-057, with the IC50 observed at 5 μm (Fig. 1C). The colony-forming ability of BC cells such as MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells in the presence or absence of NMK-T-057 was determined by in vitro clonogenic assay, following the protocol described under “Experimental procedures.” Viable cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/ml for colony formation and simultaneously treated with different concentrations of NMK-T-057 (0–10 μm) from the 2nd to the 6th day. Crystal violet staining of the viable colonies revealed that NMK-T-057 significantly inhibited the colony-forming properties of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, D and E). To determine the mode of cell death in NMK-treated BC cells we checked the induction of apoptosis by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining method using FACS. We observed that treatment of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7 cells with different concentrations of NMK-T-057 resulted in a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1). In the presence of 5 μm compound, the apoptotic population was found to increase 25% from 2% in untreated MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas in MDA-MB-468 cells, the apoptotic population increased from 1.5 to 35%. Similarly, when treated with 10 μm compound, the apoptotic population increased to 37% in MDA-MB-231 cells and 42% in MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. Consistent with the cell viability results, MCF-7 cells showed higher responsiveness to NMK-T-057–induced apoptosis. In the presence of 3 μm compound, the apoptotic population increased to 30% as compared with 1.2% in control cells, whereas in the presence of 5 μm compound, the apoptotic population increased to 45%. Migratory ability of various BC cells in the presence and absence of NMK-T-057 was assessed by Boyden chamber assay. Migratory activities of BC cells were found to be significantly decreased by NMK-T-057 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1G). In the presence of 5 μm NMK-T-057, the extent of migration was decreased by 1.9- and 1.5-fold for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. Similarly, treatment with 10 μm NMK-T-057 resulted in a decrease of migration by 2.7- and 2.4-fold, respectively. Consistent with our previous results, treatment of MCF-7 cells with NMK-T-057 resulted in drastic inhibition of cell migration. In the presence of 3 and 5 μm NMK-T-057, migration of MCF-7 cells was decreased by 2.7- and 4.8-fold, respectively (Fig. 1G). After demonstrating the noncytotoxic effect of NMK-T-057 in noncancer cells, we further assessed its toxicity in female Swiss albino mice. NMK-T-057 was injected intraperitoneally in female mice at different doses of (10–100 mg/kg-BW). On the 7th day of i.p. treatment, different hematological and clinical parameters were determined to assess the toxicity of NMK-T-057. We observed that NMK treatments did not significantly affect the red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels in mice compared with the control group. Only minor alterations in the total white blood cell counts were observed, particularly the differential counts for neutrophils and lymphocytes in NMK-treated groups compared with the control group. Additionally, we also observed that NMK-T-057 had no added toxic effects on the liver, as revealed by measuring serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in serum from each experimental set. No significant alterations in serum SGOT, SGPT, and ALP levels were observed in NMK-treated mice compared with control mice (Table S1), and all the values fell within the normal range. Thus, consistent with in vitro results, NMK-T-057 showed limited toxicity in in vivo conditions as well. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is an important physiological process responsible for the acquisition of migratory and invasive phenotype by BC cells that enhances their ability to invade the surrounding tissues (38Christofori G. New signals from the invasive front.Nature. 2006; 441 (16724056): 444-45010.1038/nature04872Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). It has been reported that remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in the EMT process (39Haynes J. Srivastava J. Madson N. Wittmann T. Barber D.L. Dynamic actin remodeling during epithelial-mesenchymal transition depends on increased moesin expression.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22 (22031288): 4750-476410.1091/mbc.e11-02-0119Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Actin stress fibers are found in abundance in mesenchymal cells, whereas few stress fibers are observed in epithelial cells (39Haynes J. Srivastava J. Madson N. Wittmann T. Barber D.L. Dynamic actin remodeling during epithelial-mesenchymal transition depends on increased moesin expression.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22 (22031288): 4750-476410.1091/mbc.e11-02-0119Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells, which are known to be highly aggressive and invasive, possess a spindle-shaped morphology similar to the mesenchymal type. Staining the actin cytoskeleton with phalloidin-FITC revealed an organized network of F-actin filaments in the untreated cells. However, on treatment with sublethal concentrations of NMK-T-057 (3–5 μm), we observed that the mesenchymal morphology of MDA-MB-231 cells was altered to epithelial type accompanied by disruption of the actin stress fibers (Fig. 2A). We further investigated the status of several EMT markers in NMK-T-057–treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, we observed that proteins like vimentin, N-cadherin, and TWIST, which are essential for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype, were significantly down-regulated by NMK-T-057 in a dose-dependent fashion. Conversely, epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and cytokeratin-19 were also found to be significantly up-regulated in NMK-T-057–treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). We also observed that the CD44high/CD24low population, responsible for the metastatic potential and stemness properties of BC cells (40Jin J. Krishnamachary B. Mironchik Y. Kobayashi H.

Twenty-four cats were included in a prospective, blinded clinical trial. Cats were equally divided into minimal (minimal dental treatment) or severe (multiple dental extractions) oral disease groups. They were admitted (day 0) and underwent oral examination/radiographs/treatment under general anesthesia (day 1; acepromazine-hydromorphone-propofol-isoflurane-meloxicam-local anesthetic blocks). Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured on days 0 and 6. Pain was scored using the Glasgow composite measure pain scale-feline (CMPS-F). Rescue analgesia was administered with hydromorphone if CMPS-F ≥ 5/20. Dry and soft food intake (%) during 3 minutes and 2 hours, and daily soft food were calculated. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel and Chi-square tests, Spearman’s rank correlation and linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis (alpha = 0.05). Pain scores were significantly increased in cats with severe disease when compared with baseline (up to day 4) and minimal disease (all postoperative time points). Prevalence of rescue analgesia was significantly higher in severe (91.7%) than minimal disease (0%); analgesics were required up to day 3. Pain scores and frequency of rescue analgesia were significantly correlated with the number of tooth extractions, gingival and calculus index. Prevalence of rescue analgesia was significantly correlated with the number of missing teeth, teeth extractions and gingival index. Dry and soft food intake during 3 minutes, and dry food intake during 2 hours were significantly lower in the severe than minimal disease group throughout the study.

Despite the recurrence of drought, both its influence on rural subsistence communities' support systems and the actions that enable structures of resilience remain poorly understood. Each incidence of drought stimulates a disaster resilience discussion that stalls without achievement of positive results until the next disaster. This study has examined the influence of recurring drought on communities' inherent resilience and proposes an evidence-based framework to enhance community resilience.Data were collected from 16 focus group discussions (N = 197) in the Highveld, Midveld and Lowveld agro-ecological regions of Swaziland and Lesotho. Themes and subthemes have been identified, defined, categorised and narrated using structuration theory as a guide.Resilience activities were found to be characterised by knowledgeability and changes in behaviour in adapting and applying appropriate actions, all of which were enhanced by institutional support. The effectiveness of institutional support hinged on harnessing communities' knowledge, social groups, value systems, connectedness, participation, decision-making and collectivism.Large-scale interventions to build and strengthen resilience are urgently needed in order to maintain cohesiveness and development gains, especially because rural subsistence farmers make up the majority of these two countries' populations. Policies that integrate resilience with national development planning must be urgently developed and executed."

The association of some M. bovis strains with hyper-virulence, MDR-TB and disseminated disease makes it imperative to understand the biology of the pathogen.Mycobacterium bovis (15) among 1755 M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolated between 2012 and 2014 were characterized and analyzed for associated patient demography and other risk factors. Five of the M. bovis isolates were whole-genome sequenced and comparatively analyzed against a global collection of published M. bovis genomes.Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from 3/560(0.5%) females and 12/1195(1.0%) males with pulmonary TB. The average age of M. bovis infected cases was 46.8 years (7-72years). TB patients from the Northern region of Ghana (1.9%;4/212) had a higher rate of infection with M. bovis (OR = 2.7,p = 0.0968) compared to those from the Greater Accra region (0.7%;11/1543). Among TB patients with available HIV status, the odds of isolating M. bovis from HIV patients (2/119) was 3.3 higher relative to non-HIV patients (4/774). Direct contact with livestock or their unpasteurized products was significantly associated with bTB (p<0.0001, OR = 124.4,95% CI = 30.1-508.3). Two (13.3%) of the M. bovis isolates were INH resistant due to the S315T mutation in katG whereas one (6.7%) was RIF resistant with Q432P and I1491S mutations in rpoB. M. bovis from Ghana resolved as mono-phyletic branch among mostly M. bovis from Africa irrespective of the host and were closest to the root of the global M. bovis phylogeny. M. bovis-specific amino acid mutations were detected among MTBC core genes such as mce1A, mmpL1, pks6, phoT, pstB, glgP and Rv2955c. Additional mutations P6T in chaA, G187E in mgtC, T35A in Rv1979c, S387A in narK1, L400F in fas and A563T in eccA1 were restricted to the 5 clinical M. bovis from Ghana.Our data indicate potential zoonotic transmission of bTB in Ghana and hence calls for intensified public education on bTB, especially among risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2918204412,"Background Retirement is one of the most important later-life status transitions related to changes in workforce participation, lifestyle, and social roles among older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of retirement on depressive symptoms by gender in middle-aged and older adult Koreans, using a large, nationally representative sample. Methods Using year 2010 and 2012 data from the Korea Longitudinal Study of Aging, we investigated the relationship between adults’ retirement status and depressive symptoms measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression (CES-D10) scale. A series of propensity score matching models were calculated to test the potential retirement effect on adults’ depressive symptoms. Results Overall, the level of depressive symptoms of the retired group was not different from that of the employed counterpart. In gender-stratified models, the gain of CES-D10 scores in the retired group was higher than that of the employed group for males, which was in the opposite direction among females. However, the propensity score matching model showed that the relationship between retirement status and CES-D10 score gain was significant for males but not for females. Conclusions Our study reinforces the assertion that retirement could worsen depressive symptoms and could differ by gender. Intervention programs focused on the mental health of retired men need to be actively developed and widely implemented."

The brown adipocyte gene expression in tAT is consistently higher than in iWAT under cold exposure, HFD feeding, and rosiglitazone treatment conditions. Our molecular profiling by RNA-Seq revealed up-regulation of energy expenditure pathways and repressed inflammation in tAT relative to eWAT and iWAT. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the master fatty acid oxidation regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α is dispensable for maintaining and activating the beige character of tAT.

The growing epidemics of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes have spurred much interest in the characterization of adipose tissue depots and their functional roles in the human body. Adipocytes have been classified into three distinct categories: white, brown, and, most recently, beige adipocytes. White adipocytes specialize in energy storage in the form of triglycerides, which can undergo lipolysis and release free fatty acids into circulation when needed (1Zechner R. Zimmermann R. Eichmann T.O. Kohlwein S.D. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Madeo F. Fat signals: lipases and lipolysis in lipid metabolism and signaling.Cell Metab. 2012; 15 (22405066): 279-29110.1016/j.cmet.2011.12.018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar).

In contrast, brown adipocytes oxidize endogenous triglycerides to generate heat, a process known as nonshivering thermogenesis. This process is accomplished primarily through the action of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that uncouples electron transport from ATP synthesis by allowing inter-membrane protons to leak back into the mitochondrial matrix (4Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Brown adipose tissue: function and physiological significance.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84 (14715917): 277-35910.1152/physrev.00015.2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (4525) Google Scholar).

These thermogenic adipocytes are interspersed within WAT depots and respond to environmental stimuli. Specifically, cold exposure, chronic endurance exercise, and β3-adrenergic receptor activation in mice efficiently induce certain WAT depots to adopt features of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a process known as brown remodeling, browning, or beiging (7Vitali A.

Like classical brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes possess multilocular lipid droplets and densely-packed mitochondria that express Ucp1 and other genes that promote energy expenditure (11Mulya A.

The origin of beige cells has been explained by either trans-differentiation, the direct conversion of white adipocytes into brown-like cells (13Barbatelli G. Murano I. Madsen L. Hao Q. Jimenez M.

Along with the development of thermogenic capacity during brown remodeling, stimulation of beige adipocyte activity has been associated with reduced body weight, insulin resistance, and adiposity (12Kajimura S. Spiegelman B.M. Seale P. Brown and beige fat: physiological roles beyond heat generation.Cell Metab. 2015; 22 (26445512): 546-55910.1016/j.cmet.2015.09.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 16Harms M.

As such, increasing the number or activity of thermogenic adipocytes in humans may have similar metabolic benefits. In adult humans, thermogenic adipocytes in the form of BAT has been discovered in multiple locations, including the axillary, cervical, supraclavicular, paravertebral, and abdominal subcutaneous regions (17Virtanen K.A. Lidell M.E. Orava J. Heglind M. Westergren R. Niemi T. Taittonen M. Laine J. Savisto N.J. Enerbäck S. Nuutila P. Functional brown adipose tissue in healthy adults.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360 (19357407): 1518-152510.1056/NEJMoa0808949Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). Transcriptional analyses of these adipose depots, however, indicate that nearly all human BAT expresses molecular markers selective to beige adipocytes in mice and do not express canonical brown fat-selective genes (18Sharp L.Z. Shinoda K. Ohno H. Scheel D.W. Tomoda E. Ruiz L. Hu H. Wang L. Pavlova Z. Gilsanz V. Kajimura S.

Furthermore, the isolation of clonally derived beige-like adipocytes from adult humans has demonstrated the existence of beige adipocytes in human WAT (20Shinoda K. Luijten I.H. Hasegawa Y. Hong H. Sonne S.B. Kim M. Xue R. Chondronikola M. Cypess A.M. Tseng Y.H. Nedergaard J. Sidossis L.S. Kajimura S. Genetic and functional characterization of clonally derived adult human brown adipocytes.Nat. Med. 2015; 21 (25774848): 389-39410.1038/nm.3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Browning has thus gained much attention as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders (21Poher A.L. Altirriba J. Veyrat-Durebex C. Rohner-Jeanrenaud F. Brown adipose tissue activity as a target for the treatment of obesity/insulin resistance.Front. Physiol. 2015; 6 (25688211): 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Farmer S.R. Obesity: be cool, lose weight.Nature. 2009; 458 (19370020): 839-84010.1038/458839aCrossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is thus of great interest to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of WAT browning during which beige adipocytes are activated from basal status, as such knowledge would potentially allow for the manipulation of adipose plasticity and the improvement of metabolic health. Because iWAT is enriched with beige adipocytes and undergoes significant brown remodeling in response to genetic, pharmacological, and environmental stimuli (23Seale P. Conroe H.M. Estall J. Kajimura S. Frontini A. Ishibashi J. Cohen P. Cinti S. Spiegelman B.M. Prdm16 determines the thermogenic program of subcutaneous white adipose tissue in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 (21123942): 96-10510.1172/JCI44271Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), it is widely used as a source of these adipocytes to study their development as well as the process of WAT browning. However, numerous adipose depots exist in a variety of anatomic locations and exhibit a broad range of metabolic activity (24Zhang F. Hao G. Shao M. Nham K. An Y. Wang Q. Zhum Y. Kusminski C.M. Hassan G. Gupta R.K. Zhai Q. Sun X. Scherer P.E. Oz O.K. An adipose tissue atlas: an image-guided identification of human-like BAT and beige depots in rodents.Cell Metab. 2018; 27 (29320705): 252-262.e310.1016/j.cmet.2017.12.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This engenders the possibility that other fat depots may have higher browning capacities than iWAT and may serve as alternative or even superior beige fat sources. In our study, we identified an adipose depot in mice, adjacent to iWAT and attached to the thigh, which possesses higher browning potential than iWAT and expresses BAT-selective markers even without environmental stimuli; this fat depot may therefore serve as a more appropriate model for brown remodeling studies. Subcutaneous fat, particularly the inguinal depot, is widely used to study brown remodeling of white fat. However, even after significant brown remodeling, such as by cold exposure, its relative expression of brown adipocyte markers is still much lower than that of the canonical BAT. We therefore sought to identify a depot with higher browning potential, with the goal of establishing a better model for the investigation of adipose plasticity. We first noticed a small fat pad located toward the dorsal end of inguinal fat that was darker in color (Fig. 1A, top panel). Anatomically, this depot does not belong to any of the three divisions of iWAT (dorsolumbar, inguinal, and gluteal) (25de Jong J.M. Larsson O. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. A stringent validation of mouse adipose tissue identity markers.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 308 (25898951): E1085-E110510.1152/ajpendo.00023.2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 26Waldán T.B. Hansen I.R. Timmons J.A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J.

Metab. 2012; 302 (21828341): E19-E3110.1152/ajpendo.00249.2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar); it attaches to the thigh, and thus we named it thigh adipose tissue (tAT). tAT exhibited high plasticity, as cold exposure induced the development of a nearly identical BAT-like morphology, whereas high-fat diet (HFD) feeding promoted its shift to a larger, lipid-filled white depot (Fig. 1A). These observations were corroborated with H&E staining of fat depots obtained from each treatment group (Fig. 1B). Under room temperature conditions, brown-like adipocytes were already present in tAT, in contrast to the white adipocyte morphology of iWAT. Upon cold exposure, iWAT exhibited the characteristic features of brown remodeling, as manifested through the development of numerous multilocular brown-like cells. Notably, the brown remodeling of tAT was much stronger than that of iWAT, because the majority of its cells adopted brown-like features. Moreover, unlike the authentic brown adipocytes, these cold-induced brown-like adipocytes in tAT were larger and more spherical, implying a WAT origin. This was supported by the fully-white adipocyte look of tAT in HFD or aged mice, namely the appearance of large, unilocular cells similar to adipocytes in iWAT (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that tAT is a hyperplastic fat depot. Like BAT, tAT was responsive to cold exposure as observed by the induction of Ucp1 (Fig. 1C). To further characterize the browning potential of tAT, we compared its gene expression levels of brown markers and thermogenic regulators to those of a few other major fat depots including eWAT, the representative white fat; iWAT, a widely-used beige depot; and BAT, the classic brown fat, after chronic cold exposure. The expression of brown adipocyte markers including Ucp1, Dio2, Cox7a1, Cox8b, and Cidea, as well as transcriptional regulators including PPARa, C/EBPb, Prdm16, and Pgc-1a, was significantly higher in tAT than in iWAT but lower than in BAT (Fig. 1, C and D). Of note, whereas the adipocyte master regulators PPARg1 and PPARg2 were comparable in all four examined fat depots, the expression of white adipocyte-enriched genes including Adipsin, Leptin, Resistin, and Adiponectin was higher in tAT than in BAT, but lower than in iWAT and eWAT (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, in cultured fat explants, tAT responded to forskolin by inducing brown adipocyte genes; their expression levels in tAT were higher overall than in iWAT, and lower than in BAT (Fig. S1). Thus, the gene expression signature of tAT is intermediate between that of iWAT and BAT, indicating that tAT is a more natural beige fat than iWAT. Because tAT is anatomically adjacent to iWAT, we employed a simple model to determine whether it is part of iWAT or is a distinct depot. In lactating female mice, the axillary and inguinal WAT, two prototypical subcutaneous depots, were almost entirely replaced by hypertrophic mammary glands, whereas tAT did not undergo this change- it retained its beige color without any expansion during lactation (Fig. 2A). Histological analyses supported this observation. The ducts and alveolar lumina of the lactating glands expanded vastly into the iWAT and axillary WAT (Fig. 2B). This morphological change was also observed in the interscapular WAT of the anterior subcutaneous depot, although the adjacent interscapular BAT maintained its composition of multilocular brown adipocytes. In contrast to iWAT, tAT displayed a regular WAT morphology with the presence of a few smaller, multilocular adipocytes but a clear absence of lactating glands (Fig. 2B). Therefore, tAT is functionally distinct from iWAT and other subcutaneous depots. Indeed, tAT is covered by a muscular septum that separates it from iWAT, which raises the possibility that it may be an intramuscular adipose tissue depot. To address this possibility, we performed trichrome staining of tAT and the surrounding thigh muscle (Fig. 2C). A thin collagen layer was clearly observed at the interface between iWAT and tAT, indicating that, whereas tAT is attached to the thigh muscle, it is not intramuscular fat (27Almind K. Manieri M. Sivitz W.I. Cinti S. Kahn C.R. Ectopic brown adipose tissue in muscle provides a mechanism for differences in risk of metabolic syndrome in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104 (17283342): 2366-237110.1073/pnas.0610416104Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These data support that tAT is indeed a separate beige depot and thus has unique features atypical of regular white fat. Having determined that tAT could easily be remodeled into beige fat, we subsequently investigated how tAT responds to obesity. We induced obesity via HFD feeding, upon which tAT cells adopted white adipocyte morphology as confirmed by the similar histological appearances of tAT and iWAT (Fig. 3A). This eliminated the possibility that tAT is a mixture of both brown and white adipocytes, and ensured that the depot was completely white prior to subsequent treatment. It has been shown that insulin-sensitizing reagents known as TZDs are capable of inducing the browning of white adipocytes in vitro and in vivo by activating PPARγ (10Qiang L. Wang L. Kon N. Zhao W. Lee S. Zhang Y. Rosenbaum M. Zhao Y. Gu W. Farmer S.R. Accili D.

We therefore compared the brown remodeling of tAT induced by TZD treatment to that of canonical WAT. After a 5-week treatment with the TZD rosiglitazone, a greater number of smaller adipocytes appeared in tAT than in iWAT, in contrast to the expected lipid deposition in BAT (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, whereas tAT maintained a white adipocyte morphology on HFD, gene expression analysis revealed that tAT, compared with iWAT, exhibited over 2,600-fold higher expression of Ucp1 (Fig. 3B) as well as much higher expression levels of other brown markers including Cidea, Cox7a1, and Cox8b (Fig. 3B). Notably, even though BAT-selective markers were expressed at much higher levels in tAT than in iWAT at the basal condition, they were still able to be induced by rosiglitazone treatment comparably in tAT and iWAT, unlike the blunted response observed in BAT (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, white adipocyte-enriched genes including Adipsin, Leptin, and Resistin were significantly repressed by rosiglitazone, whereas Adiponectin was mildly up-regulated (Fig. 3C). These data collectively illustrate that tAT is a hyperplastic fat depot that responds to pharmaceutical agents such as TZDs, in addition to physiological manipulations such as cold exposure and diet. qPCR analysis was also performed for classically-studied regulators of BAT-mediated thermogenesis. Surprisingly, little to no change was observed in the expression of C/EBPb, Prdm16, PGC-1a, and Hoxc10 (29Ferrannini G. Namwanje M. Fang B. Damle M. Li D. Liu Q. Lazar M.A. Qiang L.

To characterize the “natural” beige state of tAT from a molecular perspective, we performed single-end RNA-seq of poly(A)-selected RNAs from tAT and three other well-defined adipose depots (BAT, eWAT, and iWAT) in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Under DIO, tAT exhibited a WAT morphology and a more pronounced difference compared with iWAT than under cold exposure (Table S1). Sequenced reads were aligned against mouse Ensembl gene annotations (mm10) using TopHat and quantified using Cufflinks (30Trapnell C. Roberts A. Goff L. Pertea G. Kim D. Kelley D.R. Pimentel H.

Protoc. 2012; 7 (22383036): 562-57810.1038/nprot.2012.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We first set out to provide a quantitative global transcriptomic proximity of tAT with the three classical adipose tissues by using expression levels of annotated protein-coding genes to calculate all possible pairwise correlations among the 16 samples (Fig. 4A). Compared with the correlations between classical BAT and WAT (iWAT and eWAT), which are highly divergent in morphology and physiology (r = 0.5–0.7), tAT samples showed a consistent and higher correlation with both WAT (r = 0.75–0.94) and BAT (r = 0.74–0.88) groups. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering (Fig. S2) and principal component analysis (Fig. 4B) revealed that whereas BAT samples were primarily discriminated from the rest, tAT samples displayed a tight and distinct cluster from eWAT and iWAT samples. Taken together, the global projection of the transcriptome strongly suggests that tAT is a distinct fat depot with molecular features that are intermediate between those of BAT and WAT. We then attempted to discover a plausible biological role of this new fat depot by identifying the significantly differentially expressed protein-coding genes (DEGs) with respect to BAT, eWAT, and iWAT (Fig. S3). As expected, the comparisons between BAT and eWAT (2,674 genes) or iWAT (2,311 genes) yielded a large number of DEGs, whereas the smallest change was observed between eWAT and iWAT (114 genes). Interestingly, the number of DEGs between BAT and tAT (1,271) was about half the number of DEGs between BAT and WAT (Fig. S3), suggesting that there is greater transcriptomic proximity between tAT and BAT than between BAT and WATs. We proceeded to investigate the specific set of DEGs in tAT versus classical WAT. We detected 116 and 48 up-regulated protein-coding genes in tAT compared with eWAT and iWAT, respectively (fold-change ≥ 3, q < 0.01) (Fig. 5A, Fig. S3), both of which were enriched for highly similar categories of gene ontologies such as “single-organism catabolic process” and “carboxylic acid metabolic process” (Fig. S4, A and C). Of these, as many as 40 genes (p < 2.2e-16, hypergeometric test) (Fig. 5A), including key brown fat markers such as Ucp1 and PPARα (Fig. 5E), were found to be commonly up-regulated in tAT. These genes showed functional specialization associated with fatty acid oxidation and fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 5C), thereby suggesting a possible role of energy expenditure in tAT. A parallel analysis of the down-regulated DEGs in tAT compared with eWAT or iWAT identified 673 and 155 genes, respectively, with 134 common ones (p < 2.2e-16, hypergeometric test) (Fig. 5B, Fig. S3). Independent gene ontologies performed on these three gene lists (673, 155, and 134 genes) showed a high degree of overlap in the enriched processes mostly related to immune and inflammatory responses (Fig. 5D, Fig. S4, B and D), indicating a repressed inflammatory gene program in tAT. Because the GO analysis of the regulated genes in tAT with respect to WAT suggests that tAT manifests BAT-like properties (Fig. 5, C and D), we integrated the gene expression profiles of BAT to determine whether tAT and BAT exhibit similar gene expression patterns relative to WATs. Remarkably, BAT and tAT shared consistent expression trends, and the extent of expression change was more robust in BAT than in tAT (Fig. 5, E–G, Table S2). To gain a deeper understanding of the similarity between BAT and tAT, we compared the dynamic of expression changes of BAT and tAT, each against eWAT (Fig. 6A) and iWAT (Fig. 6B). The scatterplot of global expression changes of BAT and tAT compared with eWAT displayed a strong positive linear correlation (r = 0.71, p < 2.2e-16), indicating that most genes shared the same direction of regulation in tAT and BAT compared with eWAT (Fig. 6A). A similar positive correlation was also observed when BAT and tAT were compared with iWAT (r = 0.64, p < 2.2e-16) (Fig. 6B). In parallel, tAT and iWAT were distinguished by comparing their dynamic of expression changes against eWAT (Fig. 6C) and BAT (Fig. 6D), respectively. Indeed, the magnitude of differences between tAT and eWAT was larger than that between iWAT and eWAT, as evidenced by most points lying above y = x (line not plotted) and the regression line (Fig. 6C). In contrast, for the scatterplot for tAT/BAT versus iWAT/BAT, the latter showed a greater magnitude of differences than the former, again with the majority of points lying below y = x and the generated regression line (Fig. 6D). We further pursued this finding by comparing the identities of the genes that showed the same direction of regulation in BAT and tAT, when compared with the same WAT type (Fig. 6, E–H). In all four categories, it was apparent that tAT showed a smaller number of DEGs compared with BAT, due to the greater transcriptomic proximity between tAT and WAT than between iWAT/eWAT and BAT (Fig. 6, A and B). Nonetheless, the overlaps of the genes were significant in all cases (p < 2.2e-16, hypergeometric test), which indicates that tAT exhibits a global resemblance to BAT in diet-induced obesity. PPARα plays key roles in regulating fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Among the brown adipocyte genes enriched in tAT, it was one of the few transcription factors (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, unlike other thermogenic regulators (Fig. 3D), PPARα was induced by rosiglitazone treatment across all four fat depots examined (Fig. 7A), suggesting a potential role in regulating adipose browning. We further investigated the effects of PPARα on tAT in vivo. In ad libitum chow-fed mice sacrificed at room temperature, the morphologies of eWAT, iWAT, tAT, and BAT were indistinguishable between Ppara−/− and WT mice (Fig. 7B). Likewise, there was no significant difference in the expression of brown markers, inflammatory markers, and white adip"

Ab initio energy calculations have highlighted that the conformational orientations and the effects of substitutions are important for stable aromatic interactions among aromatic rings, but studies in the context of a protein’s fold and function are elusive. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a common post-translational modifier that affects diverse cellular processes. Here, we report that a highly conserved aromatic triad of three amino acids, Phe36-Tyr51-Phe64, is a unique SUMO signature that is absent in other ubiquitin-like homologous folds. We found that a specific edge-to-face conformation between the Tyr51-Phe64 pair of interacting aromatics is vital to the fold and stability of SUMO. Moreover, the noncovalent binding of SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) at the SUMO surface was critically dependent on the paired aromatic interactions buried at the core. NMR structural studies revealed that perturbation of the Tyr51-Phe64 conformation disrupts several long-range tertiary contacts in SUMO, leading to a heterogeneous and dynamic protein with attenuated SUMOylation both in vitro and in cells. A subtle perturbation of the edge-to-face conformation by a Tyr to Phe substitution significantly decreased stability, SUMO/SIM affinity, and the rate of SUMOylation.

The SUMO modification process, also known as SUMOylation, involves a multistep enzymatic reaction (27Welchman R.L. Gordon C. Mayer R.J.

Recognition of SUMOylated substrates by receptors via noncovalent binding of SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) activates several downstream pathways. A relevant example of SUMO/SIM interaction is the constitution of large multiprotein promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). The organization of PML-NBs depends on the interaction between the SUMO conjugated to the protein PML and the SIM present in the adjacent PML, which allows the formation of in trans homo-oligomeric complexes (28Lallemand-Breitenbach V. de Thá H.

Here, we report a conserved aromatic triad of three amino acids, phenylalanine 36, tyrosine 51, and phenylalanine 64 (Phe36-Tyr51-Phe64), present at the core of SUMO1. The triad forms a unique set of interactions that are absent in other homologous UBL folds. The Tyr51-Phe64 pair of interacting aromatics form a specific edge-to-face conformation, which is critical for the fold and stability of SUMO1. Moreover, the conformation of the Tyr51-Phe64 pair at the buried core of SUMO1 has long-range effects at the remote SIM-binding interface and modulates the SUMO/SIM interaction. Protein structure determination and protein dynamics studies indicated that SUMO1 adopts a flexible structure when the edge-to-face interaction is perturbed. The flexible structure reduces the efficiency of SUMOylation, both in vitro and in cellular conditions. Finally, a subtle perturbation of the Phe-Tyr edge-to-face orientation by substitution of the facially located tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y51F) significantly reduces the stability and function of SUMO1. Our results suggest that conservation of the interaction geometry between aromatic groups at a protein’s hydrophobic core is important for its function. The contribution of specific ring orientation to overall stabilization energy can be more significant than indicated by ab initio calculations.

Among them, side chains of three amino acids phenylalanine 36 (Phe36), tyrosine 51 (Tyr51), and phenylalanine 64 (Phe64) form an aromatic triad (Fig. 1b). The fourth aromatic residue phenylalanine 66 (Phe66) does not have any contact with the rest of the aromatic triad and is not exclusive to SUMO. Reported high resolution (1.46 Å) crystal structures of human SUMO1 (PDB 4WJO) (34Cappadocia L. Mascle X.H. Bourdeau V. Tremblay-Belzile S. Chaker-Margot M. Lussier-Price M. Wada J. Sakaguchi K.

In contrast, the Phe36 aromatic ring has a tilted orientation with the Tyr51 aromatic ring. A similar orientation of the aromatics was observed in other high-resolution structures of SUMO1 (PDB codes 4WJQ, 4WJP, etc.). Sequence alignment with members of different UbLs (67 families) revealed that the conserved aromatic triad is unique to the SUMO-fold, whereas conserved aliphatic residues are prevalent across ubiquitin-like proteins. An example is ubiquitin (35Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. Structure of ubiquitin refined at 1.8 Å resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194 (3041007): 531-54410.1016/0022-2836(87)90679-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), where instead of aromatic residues the hydrophobic core is formed by leucine 15, isoleucine 30, and leucine 43 (Fig. 1c). The core aromatic amino acids were mutated to their corresponding hydrophobic aliphatic amino acids in ubiquitin (F36L, Y51I, and F64L), to assess the contribution of the individual aromatic amino acids for the stability of SUMO1. These mutants would maintain similar hydrophobicity at the core but selectively perturb the aromatic triad interaction. In contrast to alanine substitutions, the number of contacts formed by the isoleucine/leucine substitution to the rest of the protein is similar to the WT, and the number of contacts between the triad is also conserved upon substitution (Fig. S1). The wt-SUMO1 and the mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The mutants preserved the secondary structure of SUMO1 as shown by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig. 2a). The stability of the proteins was probed by CD spectroscopy as a function of temperature (Fig. 2b). The WT SUMO1 has a melting point Tm of 69 °C, similar to that observed in previous studies of SUMO1. Mutating the Phe36 to leucine (F36L-SUMO1) did not affect the SUMO1 stability (Tm = 67 °C, Fig. 2b, Table 1). Alternately, mutating Tyr51 to isoleucine (Y51I) and Phe64 to leucine (F64L) showed a significant reduction in stability. The Tm of mutants Y51I-SUMO1 and F64L-SUMO1 were measured to be 59 °C and 48 °C, respectively (Fig. 2b, Table 1). The differential contribution of the aromatic triad to the stability of SUMO1 was further supported by urea-induced denaturation melt profiles (Fig. 2c). A gradual decrease in urea concentration (Cm) at 50% unfolded state was observed starting from wt-SUMO1, followed by F36L-SUMO1, Y51I-SUMO1, and F64L-SUMO1, respectively (Table 1). Phe36 has a higher accessible surface area (36.4 Å2), compared with Tyr51 (8.0 Å2) or Phe64 (3.7 Å2). The aromatics Tyr51 and Phe64 are buried at the core of SUMO1, and their substitution has an extensive effect on the stability of SUMO1.Table 1Temperature melts, urea melts, and binding constants of SUMO1 variantsProteinTmCmKd with PML-SIM°Cmμmwt-SUMO169.0 ± 0.54.37 ± 0.0985 ± 15F36L-SUMO167.0 ± 0.53.94 ± 0.12670 ± 119Y51I-SUMO159.0 ± 0.33.90 ± 0.15474 ± 80F64L-SUMO148.0 ± 0.32.40 ± 0.25434 ± 70Y51F-SUMO162.6 ± 0.3NDaND, not determined.350 ± 31a ND, not determined.

Steady-state ANS fluorescence was monitored for the wt-SUMO1 and mutant SUMO1 proteins (Fig. 2d). ANS shows a blue-shifted emission maximum and increased fluorescence intensity upon binding to exposed hydrophobic patches in proteins. The ANS fluorescence emission maxima were unaffected in the presence of wt-SUMO1, suggesting that few solvent-accessible hydrophobic residues are present to interact with ANS. When incubated with F36L-SUMO1, ANS fluorescence was similar to wt-SUMO1. Interestingly, the incubation with Y51I-SUMO1 increased the ANS fluorescence intensity along with a 10-nm blue shift in the emission maxima, indicating increased solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues in Tyr51-SUMO1. The ANS fluorescence intensity was highest with an accompanied blue shift by 16 nm in the presence of F64L-SUMO1 (Fig. 2d), indicating a significant alteration in the core packing compared with wt-SUMO1 with further increase in solvent-exposed hydrophobic regions in F64L-SUMO1. The amide chemical shifts are sensitive to changes in the chemical environment of proteins. The wt-SUMO1 and the three mutants were expressed in 13C,15N-labeled medium and purified. The 15N-1H-edited heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments of all the four proteins are given in Fig. S2. The HSQC spectra for all the three mutants were well-dispersed. The backbone 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO resonances of the wt-SUMO1 and the three mutants were assigned by standard triple resonance NMR experiments (details are under “Materials and methods”). Perturbations due to the altered chemical environment upon mutation-induced changes in the chemical shift of the backbone amide resonances, which were then calculated as chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) between the wt-SUMO1 and the three mutants (Fig. 3). The CSP between wt-SUMO1 and F36L-SUMO1 were negligible (Fig. 3a). However, large CSPs were observed in Y51I-SUMO1 across several residues in the protein (Fig. 3b). The maximum perturbation was observed for F64L-SUMO1 (Fig. 3c, Figs. S3 and S4). Several major CSPs were observed in α1. As Phe64 aromatic side chain is tightly packed against the helix α1, the CSPs in α1 were expected. Surprisingly, several major CSPs were also noted in the β-strand β2, which is not in direct contact with Phe64. The altered chemical environment at F64L is probably relayed through the aromatic network to Phe36 (and β2). Receptors of the SUMOylated substrates can identify the substrates via the SUMO/SIM interaction. Reported X-ray and NMR structures of SUMO/SIM complexes have shown that SIMs bind to the β2α1 hydrophobic groove of SUMO (34Cappadocia L. Mascle X.H. Bourdeau V. Tremblay-Belzile S. Chaker-Margot M.

Because mutations at the core altered the chemical environment in distant regions like β2, they could also affect the SUMO/SIM interaction. A well-studied SIM containing protein is the PML protein. The structure of SUMO1 bound to PML-SIM showed that PML-SIM binds to the grove between β2 and α1 in a parallel orientation to β2 (34Cappadocia L. Mascle X.H. Bourdeau V. Tremblay-Belzile S.

A synthetic peptide of 20 residues containing the PML-SIM sequence was used for an NMR titration experiment. In this experiment, PML-SIM was titrated on 15N-labeled SUMO1 or SUMO1 mutants, and 15N-1H-edited HSQCs were recorded at each titration point. Perturbations due to the altered chemical environment upon ligand binding induce changes in the chemical shift of the backbone amide resonances, which can be reported by measuring the CSPs. When the PML-SIM was titrated against wt-SUMO1, major CSPs were observed in the region between β2 and α1 (Fig. 4a, Fig. S5a), supporting previous studies of PML-SUMO/SIM binding (34Cappadocia L.

The dissociation constant of the wt-SUMO1/PML-SIM complex was measured to be 85 μm, similar to earlier reports (Table 1, Fig. S5b) (39Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y.

In comparison, the F36L-SUMO1 interacted to PML-SIM weakly (Fig. 4b) and did not have major CSPs at the same protein:ligand ratio (1:5) as the wt-SUMO1 (Fig. S6). The dissociation constant of the Phe36-SUMO1/PML-SIM complex was measured to be 670 μm, indicating an 8-fold drop in affinity. Phe36 is present at the interface of SUMO/SIM interaction, where it forms five contacts with Val557 of PML-SIM (Fig. S7a). In contrast, modeled mutant Leu36 forms a single contact with PML-SIM (Fig. S7b), which explains the reduction in SUMO1/SIM affinity upon F36L mutation. The Tyr51 and Phe64 are buried and located far from the SIM interface (Fig. S8, a and b). Intriguingly, both aromatic mutants showed lower CSPs upon titration with PML-SIM (Fig. 4, c and d, and Fig. S6) and a 5-fold drop in affinity (Table 1), indicating that triad interaction at the core can modulate binding at the interface. The structure of F64L-SUMO1 was determined by NMR to obtain higher resolution information of the altered environment in SUMO1 upon disrupting the Tyr51-Phe64 edge-to-face conformation. The F64L-SUMO1 backbone and side chain 13C, 1H, and 15N resonances were assigned by standard triple resonance experiments on uniformly 13C,15N-labeled protein (Fig. S3). In addition, 13C-edited and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments were carried out to obtain distance restraints from NOE cross-peaks. A separate 13C-edited aromatic NOESY-HSQC was collected to measure the NOEs due to aromatic side chains exclusively. Analysis of the triple resonance data showed that side chain resonances for some residues in the ordered region of SUMO1 (aa 20–22, 37–39, 48–50, and 56–59) have broadened out, indicating major conformational exchange in the F64L-SUMO1. Such broadening was not observed in wt-SUMO1 under similar conditions. The number of unassigned atoms was compared with the assignments of wt-SUMO1, and the difference is plotted against the residue number in Fig. S9a. The NOESY spectra yielded a total of 1058 NOE distance restraints. The number of inter-residue NOEs (sequential, medium, and long) per residue is plotted in Fig. S9b. In several regions, a higher number of unassigned atoms correlated well with a lower number of NOEs per residue.

The objective of the current study is to examine the treatment patterns, clinical outcomes and their associated factors among PLWH in Guangxi, China before and after this new guideline.Data from three community-based projects conducted at different time points over a period of six years (2012-2017) in Guangxi were analyzed in our study. The interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Measures of clinical outcomes were retrieved from the patients' medical records. Descriptive analysis was employed to display treatment patterns and the time trends of clinical outcomes. Chi-square test or ANOVA was used to compare the differences in background characteristics and treatment history between different levels of clinical outcomes.Among the pooled sample of 4224 participants, 77.3% were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), the median CD4 count was 328 cells/mm3, and 82.5% were virally suppressed. An increasing trend in both ART coverage (from 72.1% to 91.2%) and CD4 count (from 318 cells/mm3 to 357 cells/mm3) was observed over time in the three samples, while rates of viral suppression did not show a similar trend. A number of socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., female gender, younger age, Han ethnicity, and employment) and treatment-related variables (e.g., longer durations of HIV diagnosis and ART uptake, lower prevalence of comorbidity, fewer treatment interruptions, and more knowledge on ART) were associated with improved clinical outcomes.We observed a high rate of viral suppression and increasing trends in ART coverage and CD4 count over six years in Guangxi, China. However, suboptimal clinical outcomes continue to be a problem, particularly among some subgroups of PLWH. Future clinical management strategies should be tailored for PLWH with different sociodemographic characteristics and treatment trajectories."

The aim of this study was to analyze the MADS-box genes expressed in the inflorescence of Orchis italica, a wild Mediterranean orchid species. MADS-box proteins are transcription factors involved in various plant biological processes, including flower development. In the floral tissues of O. italica, 29 MADS-box genes are expressed that are classified as both class I and II. Class I MADS-box genes include one Mβ-type gene, thereby confirming the presence of this type of MADS-box genes in orchids. The class II MIKC* gene is highly expressed in the column, which is consistent with the conserved function of the MIKC* genes in gametophyte development. In addition, homologs of the SOC, SVP, ANR1, AGL12 and OsMADS32 genes are expressed. Compared with previous knowledge on class II MIKCC genes of O. italica involved in the ABCDE model of flower development, the number of class B and D genes has been confirmed. In addition, 4 class A (AP1/FUL) transcripts, 2 class E (SEP) transcripts, 2 new class C (AG) transcripts and 1 new AGL6 transcript have been identified. Within the AP1/FUL genes, the sequence divergence, relaxation of purifying selection and expression profiles suggest a possible functional diversification within these orchid genes. The detection of only two SEP transcripts in O. italica, in contrast with the 4 genes found in other orchids, suggests that only two SEP genes could be present in the subfamily Orchidoideae. The expression pattern of the MIKCC genes of O. italica indicates that low levels at the boundary of the domain of a given MADS-box gene can overlap with the expression of genes belonging to a different functional A-E class in the adjacent domain, thereby following a “fading borders” model."

One essential method for most molecular approaches is the analysis of gene expression by reverse-transcription quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR). For the normalisation of expression data in RT-qPCR experiments, it is essential to use reliable reference genes that are not affected under a wide range of conditions. In this study we establish a set of 15 A. alpina reference genes that were tested under different conditions including cold, drought, heat, salt and gibberellic acid treatments. Data analyses with geNORM, BestKeeper and NormFinder revealed the most stable reference genes for the tested conditions: RAN3, HCF and PSB33 are most suitable for cold treatments; UBQ10 and TUA5 for drought; RAN3, PSB33 and EIF4a for heat; CAC, TUA5, ACTIN 2 and PSB33 for salt and PSB33 and TUA5 for gibberellic acid treatments. CAC and ACTIN 2 showed the least variation over all tested samples. In addition, we show that two reference genes are sufficient to normalize RT-qPCR data under our treatment conditions. In future studies, these reference genes can be used for an adequate normalisation and thus help to generate high quality RT-qPCR data in A. alpina."

https://openalex.org/W2919990220,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play an important physiological role as regulators of all blood and immune cell populations, and are of clinical importance for bone marrow transplants. Regulating HSC biology in vitro for clinical applications requires improved understanding of biological inducers of HSC lineage specification. A significant challenge for controlled HSC expansion and differentiation is the complex network of molecular crosstalk between multiple bone marrow niche components influencing HSC biology. We describe a biology-driven computational approach to model cell kinetics in vitro to gain new insight regarding culture conditions and intercellular signaling networks. We further investigate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation that drives early and late hematopoietic progenitor populations. We demonstrate that changing the feedback driven by cell-secreted biomolecules alters lineage specification in early progenitor populations. Using a first order deterministic model, we are able to predict the impact of media change frequency on cell kinetics, as well as distinctions between primitive long-term HSCs and differentiated myeloid progenitors. Integrating the computational model and sensitivity analyses we identify critical culture parameters for regulating HSC proliferation and myeloid lineage specification. Our analysis suggests that accurately modeling the kinetics of hematopoietic sub-populations in vitro requires direct contributions from early progenitor differentiation along with the more traditionally considered intermediary oligopotent progenitors. While consistent with recent in vivo results, this work suggests the need to revise our perspective on HSC lineage engineering in vitro for expansion of discrete hematopoietic populations."

Using ChIP sequencing, locus-specific methylation analysis, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, and RT-qPCR (quantitative RT-PCR) and immunoblot assays, we found that short-term treatment (a few hours) with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) activates IL-32 in a DNA demethylation–independent manner. In contrast, prolonged TNFα treatment (several days) induced DNA demethylation at the promoter and a CpG island in the IL-32 gene in a TET (ten-eleven translocation) family enzyme– and NF-κB–dependent manner. Notably, the hypomethylation status of transcriptional regulatory elements in IL-32 was maintained for a long time (several weeks), causing elevated IL-32 expression even in the absence of TNFα.

These reports suggest that IL-32 is likely a cytokine involved in chronic inflammation and that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target. As a proinflammatory cytokine, the expression of IL-32 is induced during bacterial and viral infections, and its expression improves host immunity in controlling these infections (13Ribeiro-Dias F.

DNA methylation is an important gene silencing mechanism that functions by recruiting corepressor proteins to impede the binding of DNA methylation–sensitive transcription factors (19Li E. Zhang Y.

DNA demethylation can be achieved by enzyme-mediated active demethylation or by passive DNA demethylation caused by interfering with maintenance DNA methylation (21Wu X. Zhang Y.

Gene expression is often regulated by sequence-specific transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Given that IL-32 expression is regulated during inflammation, understanding whether epigenetic events occur during the induction of IL-32 expression is interesting. Here we report that IL-32 is silenced by DNA methylation and that TNFα induces DNA demethylation–dependent and –independent mechanisms to control IL-32 activation. We also discuss the potential significance of these mechanisms. In our previous work, we performed RNA-Seq experiments using HEK293 cells treated with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and identified genes silenced by DNA methylation (25Li X. Shang E. Dong Q. Li Y. Zhang J. Xu S. Zhao Z. Shao W. Lv C. Zheng Y. Wang H. Lei X. Zhu B. Zhang Z.

IL-32 was one of the genes strongly activated upon 5-aza-dC treatment (Figs. 1, A and B), suggesting that IL-32 is a gene silenced by DNA methylation in HEK293 cells. Indeed, bisulfite sequencing data revealed that both the promoter and CpG island (CGI) predicted by the Sequence Manipulation Suite (27Stothard P. The sequence manipulation suite: JavaScript programs for analyzing and formatting protein and DNA sequences.Biotechniques. 2000; 28 (10868275): 1102-110410.2144/00286ir01Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) of the IL-32 gene (Fig. 1C) are highly methylated (Fig. 1D). Given that the IL-32 gene is induced by TNFα treatment (7Heinhuis B. Koenders M.I. van Riel P.L. van de Loo F.A. Dinarello C.A. Netea M.G. van den Berg W.B. Joosten L.A.

Thus, we treated HEK293 cells with 50 ng/ml TNFα and analyzed IL-32 expression at various time points. IL-32 expression began to be induced as early as 1 h post-TNFα treatment and was potently activated after 3 h of TNFα treatment (Fig. 2A). We next wanted to find out whether IL-32 activation was accompanied by DNA demethylation. Interestingly, despite the apparent transcriptional activation, no substantial DNA demethylation at the promoter or CGI of the IL-32 gene was observed after 1 h of TNFα treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate that TNFα treatment could activate IL-32 gene expression in a DNA demethylation–independent manner. We then examined THP-1 cells, a human monocyte-like cell line (28Bosshart H. Heinzelmann M. THP-1 cells as a model for human monocytes.Ann. Transl. Med. 2016; 4 (27942529): 43810.21037/atm.2016.08.53Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and HAP1 cells, a human leukemia cell line (29Kotecki M. Reddy P.S. Cochran B.H. Isolation and characterization of a near-haploid human cell line.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252 (10527618): 273-28010.1006/excr.1999.4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and also observed DNA demethylation–independent activation of IL-32 expression upon short-term TNFα treatment in these cells (Fig. S1). We noticed a slight decrease in DNA methylation at the IL-32 promoter after 3 h of TNFα treatment (Fig. 2B). This finding prompted us to perform longer TNFα treatments with measurements of IL-32 expression and DNA methylation at various time points. As we anticipated, long-term TNFα treatment (12 days) resulted in clear DNA demethylation of the IL-32 transcriptional regulatory regions; furthermore, the accumulation of DNA demethylation was accompanied by IL-32 induction (Figs. 3, A–C). DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic mark; therefore, we wanted to find out whether the methylation status of the IL-32 transcriptional regulatory regions could be stably maintained after TNFα treatment. We treated HEK293 cells with TNFα for 12 h or 12 days and then cultured the cells in TNFα-free medium for an additional 10-day period. Bisulfite sequencing data revealed that the promoter and CGI of the IL-32 gene remained largely hypomethylated in the cells that underwent 12 days of TNFα treatment and 10 days of withdrawal (Fig. 4A), indicating that TNFα-induced DNA demethylation could be maintained for a considerable period of time. Moreover, we noticed that prior exposure to long-term TNFα treatment led to elevated basal IL-32 expression, even after 10 days of TNFα withdrawal (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicated that long-term TNFα treatment not only caused a stable epigenetic change but also led to a sustained change in basal expression of the IL-32 gene. Similarly, long-term TNFα treatment caused DNA demethylation and elevated basal expression of the IL-32 gene in HAP1 cells (Fig. S2). To determine whether the above effect could be maintained for an even longer period, we treated HEK293 cells with TNFα for 12 days and then cultured them in TNFα-free medium for 10, 18, or 30 days. RT-qPCR results showed that the up-regulation of IL-32 was maintained after 10, 18, and 30 days, although the up-regulated level became more moderate after 30 days (Fig. 4D). Consistently, the DNA methylation level of the IL-32 promoter and CpG island began to increase after 30 days of TNFα withdrawal (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results suggest that long-term TNFα treatment can induce heritable hypomethylation at the promoter and CpG island of the IL-32 gene, causing long-term transcriptional alteration. DNA demethylation can be achieved by passive demethylation, TET enzyme–mediated active oxidation and demethylation, or both (21Wu X. Zhang Y. TET-mediated active DNA demethylation: mechanism, function and beyond.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2017; 18 (28555658): 517-53410.1038/nrg.2017.3310.1038/nrm.2017.35Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 30Pastor W.A. Aravind L. Rao A.

Cell Biol. 2013; 14 (23698584): 341-35610.1038/nrm3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). To find out whether passive demethylation was involved in TNFα induced demethylation, we attempted to arrest the cells at S phase and simultaneously treated the cells with TNFα. Unfortunately, these cells suffered from severe cell death, and we were unable to draw a clear conclusion about whether there was any involvement of passive demethylation. To determine whether DNA demethylation at the promoter and CpG island of the IL-32 gene was mediated by TET enzymes, we generated TET1 KO, TET2 KO, TET3 KO, and TET1/2/3 triple knockout (TKO) cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In these cells, frameshift mutations were introduced at the C terminus of the TET family proteins to abrogate their catalytic activity (Figs. S3 and S4, A and B). We then performed bisulfite sequencing, and the results revealed that the DNA demethylation induced by TNFα treatment at the IL-32 gene promoter and CGI was largely abrogated in TET TKO cells, with the single knockouts each displaying varied partial defects (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that the TET enzymes function together to promote TNFα-induced IL-32 gene demethylation. We also confirmed that there was no up-regulation of DNMT genes in TET TKO cells by RNA-Seq experiments (Fig. S4C). We next wanted to find out whether IL-32 gene demethylation mediated by TET enzymes was responsible for the elevated IL-32 expression levels in cells recovered from long-term TNFα treatment. Although IL-32 expression was induced by 12 h or 12 days of TNFα treatment in all of the above cells (Fig. S5), elevated IL-32 basal expression was not observed in TET TKO cells withdrawn from long-term TNFα treatment (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with the methylation states of the promoter and CGI of the IL-32 gene in these cells and support that long-term TNFα treatment induces DNA demethylation at the transcriptional regulatory regions of the IL-32 gene, elevating its basal expression level. TNFα activates the NF-κB signaling pathway and induces nuclear translocation of the canonical p50/p65 heterodimer (31Duh E.J. Maury W.J. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. Rabson A.B.

Interestingly, a p65 binding site (κB site) is located in the promoter of the IL-32 gene (Fig. 6A), and its presence was confirmed by our p65 ChIP-Seq results (Fig. 6B). Therefore, we knocked out the RELA gene, which encodes p65, in HEK293 cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (Figs. S6, A and B, and Table S4) and verified the cells using sequencing (Fig. S6C) and Western blotting (Fig. 6C). RT-qPCR data revealed that TNFα-mediated IL-32 activation was significantly impaired in RELA KO cells (Fig. 6D), indicating that p65 is the predominant transcription factor mediating IL-32 induction in response to TNFα. Moreover, in RELA KO cells treated with TNFα for 12 days, the levels of DNA demethylation at the transcriptional regulatory regions of IL-32 were reduced, especially at the CGI of the IL-32 gene (Fig. 6E). The impaired DNA demethylation at the CGI of the IL-32 gene was accompanied by less elevated basal expression of IL-32 in long-term TNFα-treated RELA KO cells (Fig. 6F). These data collectively support that TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling pathway activation leads to DNA demethylation–independent short-term activation and DNA demethylation–dependent elevation of IL-32 basal transcription in the absence of initial TNFα treatment.

The significant increase in food demand has pushed the food industry toward a rapid non-expensive production which in turn raises ethical issues. How chicken are cultivated and processed in food industry is no longer acceptable. Ethical and economical concerns emerging from chicken culling need to be solved in the near future. Indeed, in egg production industry, male chicken are killed at the age of 1-day post-hatching since they are not egg producers. A number of laboratory all over the world are looking for innovative non-invasive sexing methods to determine the sex of chicken in the early stages of the development before hatching. It will allow males’ chicken elimination before the pain-feeling stages. In order to evaluate the efficiency of these methods, the scientific community need a reliable, easy to use and cost-effective in-ovo invasive sexing method. In this report, we developed two new invasive assays based on PCR and Q-PCR techniques respectively, which fulfil the above mentioned requirements. In the same line with other groups, we exploited the differences betweed males (ZZ) and females (ZW) chicken sexual chromosomes. We identified two genes, SWIM and Xho-I, on chromosome W and DMRT gene on chromosome Z allowing a clear discrimination between the two sexes using PCR and qPCR respectively. These two new genomic markers and their corresponding methods not only increase the accuracy but also reduce time and cost of the test compared to previously developed sexing methods. Depending on the technology available in the lab, one can choose between the two techniques requiring different machines and expertise."
https://openalex.org/W2888516071,"When assessing the short-term effect of air pollution on health outcomes, it is common practice to consider one pollutant at a time, due to their high correlation. Multi pollutant methods have been recently proposed, mainly consisting of collapsing the different pollutants into air quality indexes or clustering the pollutants and then evaluating the effect of each cluster on the health outcome. A major drawback of such approaches is that it is not possible to evaluate the health impact of each pollutant. In this paper we propose the use of the Bayesian hierarchical framework to deal with multi pollutant concentrations in a two-component model: a pollutant model is specified to estimate the 'true' concentration values for each pollutant and then such concentration is linked to the health outcomes in a time-series perspective. Through a simulation study we evaluate the model performance and we apply the modelling framework to investigate the effect of six pollutants on cardiovascular mortality in Greater London in 2011-2012."
https://openalex.org/W2918865240,"In recent years a non-neuronal cholinergic system has been described in immune cells, which is often usually activated during the course of inflammatory processes. To date, it is known that Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter extensively expressed in the airways, not only induces bronchoconstriction, but also promotes a set of changes usually associated with the induction of allergic/Th2 responses. We have previously demonstrated that ACh polarizes human dendritic cells (DC) toward a Th2-promoting profile through the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). Here, we showed that ACh promotes the acquisition of an inflammatory profile by murine DC, with the increased MHC II IAd expression and production of two cytokines strongly associated with inflammatory infiltrate and tissue damage, namely TNF-α and MCP-1, which was prevented by blocking mAChR. Moreover, we showed that ACh induces the up-regulation of M3 mAChR expression and the blocking of this receptor with tiotropium bromide prevents the increase of MHC II IAd expression and TNF-α production induced by ACh on DC, suggesting that M3 is the main receptor involved in ACh-induced activation of DC. Then, using a short-term experimental murine model of ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation, we revealed that the intranasal administration of ACh-treated DC, at early stages of the inflammatory response, might be able to exacerbate the recruitment of inflammatory mononuclear cells, promoting profound structural changes in the lung parenchyma characteristic of chronic inflammation and evidenced by elevated systemic levels of inflammatory marker, TNF-α. These results suggest a potential role for ACh in the modulation of immune mechanisms underlying pulmonary inflammatory processes."

We aimed to determine the willingness of GPs in central Switzerland to participate in research, and to identify factors that facilitate or hinder research participation by GPs. To that end, we conducted a postal questionnaire survey of all 268 active GPs in the canton of Lucerne. The survey explored their interest in participating in research projects (yes/no) and factors that potentially influence their participation (5-point Likert scale from ""very important"" to ""not at all important""). We contacted all non-responders by phone. Background information of the GPs was retrieved from the database of the cantonal association of physicians. Associations between willingness to participate in research and GP's age, gender, type and location of practice, and the perceived relevance of facilitators were investigated via multiple logistic regression. Out of 268 GPs, 115 (43%) agreed to be contacted for future research projects. Willingness was associated with age (willing: 55% ≤ 40 y vs. 33% > 60 y) and gender (44% male vs. 38% female), and to some degree with the type of practice (50% group vs. 31% single), and location (46% urban vs. 38% rural), independently from each other. Scientists should develop methods to motivate and support GPs in single and rural practices to participate so research is representative of primary care as a whole."

Recent research suggests that AD could have different subtypes, presenting differences in how the disease develops. Characterizing those subtypes could be key to deepen the understanding of this complex disease. In this paper, we used a multivariate, non-supervised clustering method over blood-based markers to find subgroups of patients defined by distinctive blood marker profiles. Our analysis on ADNI database identified 4 possible subgroups, each with a different blood profile. More importantly, we show that subgroups with different profiles have a different relationship between brain phenotypes detected in magnetic resonance imaging and disease condition."

https://openalex.org/W2919122317,"Background Physical inactivity is an important but often neglected risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that physical inactivity might have deleterious effects on metabolic health in obese and non-obese subjects. Methods We evaluated the effect of physical activity on the cardiometabolic profiles of a nationwide cohort of non-obese and obese individuals who did not have overt cardiovascular diseases. A total of 3,830 study subjects were divided into two groups based on their body mass index (BMI). Within each BMI group, participants were divided according to their physical activity level. To ascertain their cardiometabolic profiles, we collected data regarding the homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level. Results Physically inactive subjects demonstrated markedly elevated HOMA-IR index and heart rates in each BMI category, even after adjustments for baseline covariates. They also tended to have worse profiles for HDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and hsCRP levels. A significant elevation in cardiometabolic risk was noted across the four physical activity/obesity groups (p<0.05). HOMA-IR index was largely affected by obesity, but within each BMI category, physical inactivity independently elevated the risk for worsening insulin resistance. In addition, physical inactivity significantly increased the risk of elevated heart rate in both non-obese and obese individuals. Notably, the detrimental effect of physical activity on heart rate was not modified by obesity. Conclusions Physical activity was associated with favorable cardiometabolic risk profiles with regard to insulin resistance status and heart rate level in both BMI groups. Our results suggest that increasing physical activity could be a helpful strategy for improving the cardiometabolic health in the Korean population, regardless of obesity status."

PNUE can also be considered as part of ‘leaf economics spectrum’ interrelated with leaf nutrient concentrations, photosynthesis and respiration, leaf life-span and dry-mass investment. However, few studies have paid attention to PNUE of N-fixing tree seedlings in subtropical China. In this study, we investigated the differences in PNUE, leaf nitrogen (N) allocation, and mesophyll conductance (gm) in Dalbergia odorifera and Erythrophleum fordii (N-fixing trees), and Betula alnoides and Castanopsis hystrix (non-N-fixing trees). PNUE of D. odorifera and E. fordii were significantly lower than those of B. alnoides and C. hystrix mainly because of their allocation of a lower fraction of leaf N to Rubisco (PR) and bioenergetics (PB). Mesophyll conductance had a significant positive correlation with PNUE in D. odorifera, E. fordii, and B. alnoides, but the effect of gm on PNUE was different between species. The fraction of leaf N to cell wall (PCW) had a significant negative correlation with PR in B. alnoides and C. hystrix seedling leaves, but no correlation in D. odorifera and E. fordii seedling leaves, which may indicate that B. alnoides and C. hystrix seedling leaves did not have enough N to satisfy the demand from both the cell wall and Rubisco. Our results indicate that B. alnoides and C. hystrix may have a higher competitive ability in natural ecosystems with fertile soil, and D. odorifera and E. fordii may grow well in N-poor soil. Mixing these non-N-fixing and N-fixing trees for afforestation is useful for improving soil N utilization efficiency in the tropical forests."

Depicting the spatiotemporal pattern of disease is important for disease regulator and deterrence strategies. Spatiotemporal modeling has distended broad veneration in recent years. Spatial and spatiotemporal disease modeling is extensively used for the analysis of registry data and usually articulated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In this study, we have developed the hierarchical spatiotemporal Bayesian modeling of the infected rate of Visceral leishmaniasis in Human (VLH). We applied the Stochastics Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach for a spatiotemporal hierarchical model for Visceral leishmaniasis in human (VLH) that involves a GF and a state process is associated with an autoregressive order one temporal dynamics and the spatially correlated error term, along with the effect of land shield, metrological, demographic, socio-demographic and geographical covariates in an endemic area of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia. The model encompasses a Gaussian Field (GF), affected by an error term, and a state process described by a first-order autoregressive dynamic model and spatially correlated innovations. A hierarchical model including spatially and temporally correlated errors was fit to the infected rate of Visceral leishmaniasis in human (VLH) weekly data from January 2015 to December 2017 using the R package R-INLA, which allows for Bayesian modeling using the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach. We found that the mean weekly temperature had a significant positive association with infected rate of VLH. Moreover, net migration rate, clean water coverage, average number of households, population density per square kilometer, average number of persons per household unit, education coverage, health facility coverage, mortality rate, and sex ratio had a significant association with the infected rate of visceral leishmaniasis (VLH) in the region. In this study, we investigated the dynamic spatiotemporal modeling of Visceral leishmaniasis in Human (VLH) through a stochastic partial differential equation approach (SPDE) using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). Our study had confirmed both metrological, demographic, sociodemographic and geographic covariates had a significant association with the infected rate of visceral leishmaniasis (VLH) in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2918842603,"The present study aimed to understand the effect of venous valve lesion on the valve cycle. A modified immersed finite element method was used to model the blood-tissue interactions in the pathological vein. The contact process between leaflets or between leaflet and sinus was evaluated using an adhesive contact method. The venous valve modeling was validated by comparing the results of the healthy valve with those of experiments and other simulations. Four valve lesions induced by the abnormal elasticity variation were considered for the unhealthy valve: fibrosis, atrophy, incomplete fibrosis, and incomplete atrophy. The opening orifice area was inversely proportional to the structural stiffness of the valve, while the transvalvular flow velocity was proportional to the structural stiffness of the valve. The stiffening of the fibrotic leaflet led to a decrease in the orifice area and a stronger jet. The leaflet and blood wall shear stress (WSS) in fibrosis was the highest. The softening of the atrophic leaflet resulted in overly soft behavior. The venous incompetence and reflux were observed in atrophy. Also, the atrophic leaflet in incomplete atrophy exhibited weak resistance to the hemodynamic action, and the valve was reluctant to be closed owing to the large rotation of the healthy leaflet. Low blood WSS and maximum leaflet WSS existed in all the cases. A less biologically favorable condition was found especially in the fibrotic leaflet, involving a higher mechanical cost. This study provided an insight into the venous valve lesion, which might help understand the valve mechanism of the diseased vein. These findings will be more useful when the biology is also understood. Thus, more biological studies are needed."

Clinical score, OMERACT RAMRIS analysis and analysis of signal to noise ratios (SNR) of regions of interest in RA bearing mice, methotrexate/methylprednisolone acetate treated RA and control animals were compared with respect to benefit for early diagnosis.While treated RA and control animals did not show signs of RA activity in any of the above-mentioned scoring methods at any time point analyzed, RA animals revealed characteristic signs of RA in RAMRIS at the same time point when RA was detected clinically through scoring of the paws. The MR-based SNR analysis detected signs of synovitis, the earliest indication of RA, not only in late clinical stages, but also at an early stage when little or no clinical signs of RA were present in CIA animals and RAMRIS did not allow a distinct early detection.SNR analysis of contrast-enhanced MR imaging provides additional benefit for early arthritis detection in CIA mice."
https://openalex.org/W2919913482,"The genus Polymixia is the only survivor of a Late Cretaceous marine fish radiation and is often said to be the most primitive living acanthomorph (i.e., Polymixia possesses the greatest number of primitive character states for Acanthomorpha). Recent studies, including this one, place Polymixia as the sister to all other Paracanthopterygii. Despite its importance, most species of Polymixia are extremely difficult to discriminate on the basis of morphology. As a result, the number of valid species is uncertain. Moreover, there has never been a phylogenetic analysis of the genus. Thus, a molecular phylogenetic study was needed to clarify species boundaries and to resolve relationships within the genus. Tissue or DNA samples backed by museum vouchers were obtained for most species, with additional samples from new geographic areas representing specimens with distinctively different meristics and uncertain identifications. Seven loci (five nuclear and two mitochondrial) were sequenced, from which Bayesian and maximum-likelihood trees were generated. Results reveal nine species-level clades, of which five represent previously known species (Polymixia berndti, P. japonica, P. longispina, P. lowei, and P. nobilis). Surprisingly, results also reveal four previously unknown species-level clades, one close to P. lowei, one close to P. nobilis, and two new species clades related to P. japonica. The species clades are distinguished by their phylogenetic histories, sequence differences, geographic distributions, and morphologies. The clade containing P. berndti is recovered as the sister to all other species of Polymixia. Its genetic variability suggests that it might contain two or more species and it is referred to here as a “species complex”. Polymixia nobilis, the type species, was previously thought to be restricted to the Atlantic, but is now shown to be widespread in the Pacific and possibly in the Indian Ocean. Specimens from waters off Australia identified as P. busakhini actually belong to P. nobilis. In contrast, P. japonica is confirmed only in the area near Japan and the East China Sea; other more distant records are misidentifications. Wide (antipodal) geographic distributions are seen in several clades, including P. nobilis, the P. berndti species complex, and the P. japonica species group. The new phylogeny helps explain the evolution of some morphological characters previously used to distinguish groups of species, particularly dorsal-fin soft-ray count, shape of rows of scale ctenii, and number of pyloric caeca."
https://openalex.org/W2920014357,"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial warm-season C4 grass identified as a model species for bioenergy feedstock production. Lanthanum (La) as a rare earth element can stimulate the physiological processes of plant growth. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lanthanum on seed germination of switchgrass. However, no significant differences in seed germination were found. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that abundant lanthanum deposits resided on the pericarp and testa of the seed while few lanthanum deposits were present on the aleurone and endosperm. This phenomenon demonstrates that a semi-permeable layer, which could restrict or impede solute exchange, while allowing the permeability of internal and external water and gas, may be located between the testa and aleurone. Light microscopy and histochemical analysis revealed that the main chemical composition of the semi-permeable layer would be expected to be suberin because the layer was stained yellow with aniline blue. The quantum chemical calculations predict that the intervals between adjacent carbon chains in suberin molecule are so small that lanthanum ([La(H2O)8]3+) cannot pass through the suberin molecule. In conclusion, the seed germination of switchgrass is not affected by lanthanum because the semi-permeable layer restricts the penetration of lanthanum into the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2920663598,"The Risk Identification Unit (RIU) of the US Dept. of Agriculture's Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health (CEAH) conducts weekly surveillance of national livestock health data and routine coordination with agricultural stakeholders. As part of an initiative to increase the number of species, health issues, and data sources monitored, CEAH epidemiologists are building a surveillance system based on weekly syndromic counts of laboratory test orders in consultation with Colorado State University laboratorians and statistical analysts from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Initial efforts focused on 12 years of equine test records from three state labs. Trial syndrome groups were formed based on RIU experience and published literature. Exploratory analysis, stakeholder input, and laboratory workflow details were needed to modify these groups and filter the corresponding data to eliminate alerting bias. Customized statistical detection methods were sought for effective monitoring based on specialized laboratory information characteristics and on the likely presentation and animal health significance of diseases associated with each syndrome.Data transformation and syndrome formation focused on test battery type, test name, submitter source organization, and specimen type. We analyzed time series of weekly counts of tests included in candidate syndrome groups and conducted an iterative process of data analysis and veterinary consultation for syndrome refinement and record filters. This process produced a rule set in which records were directly classified into syndromes using only test name when possible, and otherwise, the specimen type or related body system was used with test name to determine the syndrome. Test orders associated with government regulatory programs, veterinary teaching hospital testing protocols, or research projects, rather than clinical concerns, were excluded. We constructed a testbed for sets of 1000 statistical trials and applied a stochastic injection process assuming lognormally distributed incubation periods to choose an alerting algorithm with the syndrome-required sensitivity and an alert rate within the specified acceptable range for each resulting syndrome. Alerting performance of the EARS C3 algorithm traditionally used by CEAH was compared to modified C2, CuSUM, and EWMA methods, with and without outlier removal and adjustments for the total weekly number of non-mandatory tests.The equine syndrome groups adopted for monitoring were abortion/reproductive, diarrhea/GI, necropsy, neurological, respiratory, systemic fungal, and tickborne. Data scales, seasonality, and variance differed widely among the weekly time series. Removal of mandatory and regulatory tests reduced weekly observed counts significantly-by >80% for diarrhea/GI syndrome. The RIU group studied outcomes associated with each syndrome and called for detection of single-week signals for most syndromes with expected false-alert intervals >8 and <52 weeks, 8-week signals for neurological and tickborne monitoring (requiring enhanced sensitivity), 6-week signals for respiratory, and 4-week signals for systemic fungal. From the test-bed trials, recommended methods, settings and thresholds were derived.Understanding of laboratory submission sources, laboratory workflow, and of syndrome-related outcomes are crucial to form syndrome groups for routine monitoring without artifactual alerting. Choices of methods, parameters, and thresholds varied by syndrome and depended strongly on veterinary epidemiologist-specified performance requirements."

Homologous recombination is a key DSB repair pathway, which functions in a largely error-free manner. In this process, the recombination machinery uses an intact DNA template—most often the sister chromatid in growing cells—to provide instructions for how to rejoin the two DNA pieces of a broken chromosome (Fig. 1A). On the molecular level, recombination is initiated by DNA end resection, which involves controlled degradation of the 5′-terminated DNA strands at the DNA break sites, leading to 3′ single-strand DNA overhangs (1Oh J.

The Mre11 nuclease then endonucleolytically cleaves the 5′-terminated DNA strand at a site internal to the DSB. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this reaction remains unclear. What is the stoichiometry and three-dimensional organization of the Ctp1–MRN ensemble bound to DNA? How is the DNA break identified? Is the resection of the two broken DNA ends coordinated? Here, Andres et al. (2Andres S.N. Li Z.M. Erie D.A. Williams R.S. Ctp1 protein–DNA filaments promote DNA bridging and DNA double-strand break repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (30626735): 3312-332010.1074/jbc.RA118.006759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) attempt to answer some of these questions using atomic force microscopy. Without double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), Ctp1 forms monodisperse peaks consistent with tetrameric complexes. With dsDNA, two important observations were made. First, filamentous complexes of Ctp1 on dsDNA were seen. Volumetric analysis revealed that these structures likely result from tandem Ctp1 tetramers bound to dsDNA. Furthermore, the authors obtained clear evidence of Ctp1 filaments bridging two dsDNA molecules. These bridging events resulted in the pairing of two dsDNA chains, either intramolecularly or in trans (2Andres S.N. Li Z.M. Erie D.A. Williams R.S. Ctp1 protein–DNA filaments promote DNA bridging and DNA double-strand break repair.J. Biol.

The images revealed a repeating pattern, consistent with adjacent tetrameric Ctp1 units mediating the dsDNA zipping. Importantly, the zipping function of Ctp1 was readily observed with circular dsDNA molecules without ends (2Andres S.N. Li Z.M. Erie D.A. Williams R.S. Ctp1 protein–DNA filaments promote DNA bridging and DNA double-strand break repair.J. Biol.

Dekker C. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Human Rad50/Mre11 is a flexible complex that can tether DNA ends.Mol.

To determine the role of Ctp1 self-interaction in this process, Andres et al. (2Andres S.N. Li Z.M. Erie D.A. Williams R.S. Ctp1 protein–DNA filaments promote DNA bridging and DNA double-strand break repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (30626735): 3312-332010.1074/jbc.RA118.006759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) utilized mutants deficient in oligomerization or containing a disulfide bond to lock oligomers in place. Analysis of these Ctp1 variants by atomic force microscopy and other assays indicated that the DNA bridging function of Ctp1 was severely affected by mutations that impair self-interaction. Furthermore, DNA bridging was impaired by mutations that disrupt DNA binding of Ctp1 (2Andres S.N. Li Z.M. Erie D.A. Williams R.S. Ctp1 protein–DNA filaments promote DNA bridging and DNA double-strand break repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (30626735): 3312-332010.1074/jbc.RA118.006759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These seminal results collectively demonstrate the DNA binding and bridging activity of Ctp1, which is likely conserved in evolution. Previously, the DNA end binding and bridging by Mre11–Rad50 was hypothesized to coordinate the resection of both ends of the broken DNA molecule (8de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C. Dekker C. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Human Rad50/Mre11 is a flexible complex that can tether DNA ends.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8 (11741547): 1129-113510.1016/S1097-2765(01)00381-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). As the bridging function of Ctp1 does not require a DNA end, an attractive possibility is that MRN mediates bridging of the DNA ends, while Ctp1 and orthologues promote the pairing of DNA internal to the end (Fig. 1B). This may protect the end from nonspecific degradation and guarantee scheduled resection by dedicated nuclease complexes. Additionally, this arrangement may facilitate simultaneous resection of both DNA ends, which could improve the efficacy of DSB repair. Another attractive possibility is that the Ctp1 filament may help direct the DNA cleavage to the 5′-terminated strand by the Mre11 nuclease away from the DNA break. The authors notice a similarity between the filaments of Ctp1 and those of the DNA mismatch repair nuclease complex Mlh1–Pms1 in yeast (MLH1–PMS2 in humans) (9Hall M.C. Wang H. Erie D.A. Kunkel T.A. High affinity cooperative DNA binding by the yeast Mlh1-Pms1 heterodimer.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312 (11575920): 637-64710.1006/jmbi.2001.4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A cardinal feature of DNA mismatch repair reactions is that a strand discontinuity in the newly synthesized strand helps direct DNA cleavage of the same DNA strand often hundreds of nucleotides away. How this function is coordinated remains to be determined, but filament formation of Mlh1–Pms1 might play an important role. Analogously, a Ctp1/Sae2/CtIP filament might help ensure that Mre11-catalyzed DNA cleavage will occur specifically in the strand carrying the 5′ terminus, even though it might be some distance away. Beyond these new mechanistic possibilities, another challenge remains in establishing the physiological relevance of DNA bridging by Ctp1. Andres et al. (2Andres S.N. Li Z.M. Erie D.A. Williams R.S. Ctp1 protein–DNA filaments promote DNA bridging and DNA double-strand break repair.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (30626735): 3312-332010.1074/jbc.RA118.006759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) do demonstrate that the mutations that impair DNA binding of Ctp1 result in cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Likewise, previous work has linked mutations that affect DNA binding of CtIP with Seckel syndrome (3Qvist P. Huertas P. Jimeno S. Nyegaard M. Hassan M.J. Jackson S.P. Børglum A.D. CtIP mutations cause Seckel and Jawad syndromes.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 (21998596)e1002310 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002310Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results certainly suggest the relevance of the DNA binding and bridging functions, but are not fully unambiguous because Ctp1 (and Sae2/CtIP) also interacts with and stimulates the nuclease activity of Mre11. The domains, which are necessary for DNA binding by Ctp1 and its orthologues, are also likely important to promote the nuclease function of Mre11 (3Qvist P. Huertas P. Jimeno S. Nyegaard M. Hassan M.J. Jackson S.P. Børglum A.D.

The isolation of separation of function mutants that are defective in one but proficient in the other functional attributes of Ctp1 would help resolve this issue. Therefore, more structural and biochemical insights are needed to fully understand how the DNA binding and bridging activities of Ctp1 and Mre11 nuclease enhancement promote DNA repair. The elegant images by Williams and colleagues will certainly inspire further research in this field."
