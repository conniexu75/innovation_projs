https://openalex.org/W1563066286,"The complete amino acid sequence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been established through the use of automated Edman degradation and standard enzymatic and chemical techniques. The location of the half-cystinyl residues was facilitated by the use of the S-[14C]aminoethyl derivative of EGF. The sequence is: [see PDF for sequence]. The calculated molecular weight of the 53-residue polypeptide is 6045, a value that is in agreement with the molecular weight of 6400 established by physical measurements. The peptide is acidic and the 6 half-cystines exist in disulfide linkage. Four arginine residues are located in the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule. The six COOH-terminal amino acids are not necessary for biological activity and EGF1–47 has activity identical with that of the 53-residue native molecule."

HL-A associated IgE antibody responsiveness was antigen specific and extended also to IgE antibody production. These data indicate an immune response (Ir) gene specific for antigen E necessary but not sufficient for the development of hay fever. This appears to be the first documentation of an Ir gene in man.
https://openalex.org/W1489802446,"Abstract The specific interaction of glucocorticoid hormones with liver cytosol proteins of adrenalectomized rats was studied by an adsorbent technique for the separation of free and protein-bound steroid. By this rapid procedure a high affinity binding site for glucocorticoids can be detected which is usually overlooked when the slower technique of equilibrium dialysis is used. This metastable binding protein can be quantitatively estimated in whole cytosol preparations because of its high affinity not only for natural glucocorticoids but also for [3H]dexamethasone, which does not bind to the other two more stable glucocorticoid-binding proteins previously reported in rat liver cytosol, the A and B proteins. It can also be distinguished from these two binding proteins for natural glucocorticoids on the basis of its differential fractionation and physical properties. Unlike the A and B proteins, which in sucrose gradients sediment at 4 S independently of ionic strength, the dexamethasone-binding protein sediments in low salt sucrose gradients largely as a heavy complex, 7 S, which reverts to a lighter form, 4 S, in the presence of 0.3 m KCl. A similar salt-dependent behavior is observed upon chromatography of the dexamethasone-binding protein through Sephadex G-200 columns. The fact that specific dexamethasone binding can only be detected in the cytosol of glucocorticoid target cells, in conjunction with previously presented evidence on its relation to hormonal enzyme induction in vivo, makes it reasonable to assume that this binding protein, which we will call the G protein, may indeed represent the physiologically significant hepatic glucocorticoid receptor."

The sensory field of the pudendal nerve was significantly larger in estrogen-treated ovariectomized female rats than in uninjected controls. This effect of estrogen was not mediated by pudendal efferents."
https://openalex.org/W1575089374,"Abstract The three glucocorticoid-binding proteins present in rat liver cytosol, A, B, and G, can be separated upon chromatography on Sephadex gels or DEAE-cellulose. All three proteins are thermolabile, but the A and B proteins resist heating for 10 min at 40°, whereas the G protein is inactivated by this treatment. The binding of glucocorticoids to the G protein is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents, whereas the binding to the A and B proteins does not require free sulfhydryl groups. Glucocorticoid binding to the G protein is optimal at physiological pH and ionic strength and is markedly affected by deviations from these conditions. The data from Sephadex gel filtration, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl, allow the calculation of the Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, and buoyant density of the binding proteins, which yielded molecular weights of 51,000 and 64,000 for the A and B proteins, respectively. In buffer of low ionic strength the G protein forms heavy complexes (7 S, molecular weight over 200,000) which readily further aggregate under our experimental conditions. At higher ionic strength the G protein behaves as a rather assymetrical molecule (4 S, frictional ratio 1.35) with a molecular weight of about 66,000. Many of these values were obtained with crude cytosol and await confirmation by comparable studies upon homogeneous preparations. The A and B proteins bind natural glucocorticoids with high affinity and specificity but show no detectable affinity for the biologically very potent 9α-fluorinated glucocorticoids. The G protein binds all the tested physiologically active natural and synthetic glucocorticoids with high affinity and specificity. The apparent association constant, Ka, of the three proteins for glucocorticoids decreases with increasing temperatures from 0–37°, but the steroid binding to the A and B proteins is much more affected by the higher temperature. At physiological temperatures the Ka of the G protein for dexamethasone is about one order of magnitude higher than the Ka of the A and B proteins for cortisol. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the binding of cortisol to the A and B proteins is accompanied by a negative change of entropy, but the binding of dexamethasone of the G protein involves a positive ΔS°."
https://openalex.org/W152486275,"An enzymatic method has been developed for the measurement of malonyl-CoA in perchloric acid extracts of liver. With this method the relative activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase have been studied in vivo by comparing the diet-induced changes in malonyl-CoA concentrations with rates of 3H2O incorporation into fatty acids. Malonyl-CoA concentrations were low in the fat-fed or 48-hours starved animal (0.004 to 0.006 µmole per g wet weight) but approached normal-fed levels (0.013 µmole per g wet weight) within 3 hours of refeeding the starved animal. The highest concentrations of malonyl-CoA (0.025 µmole per g wet weight) were found in the meal-fed animal. The de novo rates of fatty acid synthesis in vivo varied between 0.02 µmole of C2 units per min per g wet weight of liver in the starved or fat-fed animals to 0.45 µmole, of C2 units per min per g in the meal-fed group. Malonyl-CoA concentrations and the rate of tritium incorporation into fatty acids were increased above starved values in all fed groups except that group fed a high fat diet. A number of intermediary metabolites which have been proposed as controllers of the rates of fatty acid synthesis have been measured in freeze-clamped liver. There was no correlation between the rate of fatty acid synthesis and the liver content of citrate, ATP, ADP, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, or α-glycerophosphate. In addition, short term control did not appear to be exerted by free mitochondrial [NAD+]:[NADH], free cytoplasmic [NAD+]:[NADH], or [NADP+]:[NADPH], energy charge or phosphorylation state. Increases of the malonyl-CoA content and the rate of fatty acid synthesis above the starved or fat-fed values occurred when the tissue content of long chain acyl-CoA decreased below starved values. It was concluded that short term control of fatty acid synthesis in vivo most likely results from an inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by long chain acyl-CoA. The variations in the rate of fatty acid synthesis which occurred in the carbohydrate-fed groups probably result from variations in the quantity of the enzyme fatty acid synthetase."

https://openalex.org/W1495755013,"Abstract 1. Seven unusual compounds were detected in large amounts in urine from rats treated with hypoglycin A (l-α-amino-β-(methylenecyclopropyl)propionic acid). They were isolated by a combination of preparative gas-liquid chromatography and silver nitrate-impregnated thin layer chromatography. From evidence obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance, mass and infrared spectrometry, and chemical techniques, these compounds were identified as cis-4-decene-1,10-dioic, cis,cis-4,7-decadiene-1,10-dioic, cis-4-octene-1,8-dioic, glutaric, and adipic acids, N-isovalerylglycine, and N-(methylenecyclopropyl)acetylglycine. The amounts of these compounds found in urine of hypoglycin treated rats were 50 to several hundred times of controls. These compounds were not accumulated in urine of rats treated with 4-pentenoic acid, which has been believed to act similarly to hypoglycin A. 2. In vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that accumulation of glutarate is due to inhibition of glutaryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase. 3. N-(Methylenecyclopropyl)acetylglycine appears to be one of the major final metabolites of hypoglycin A. Hypoglycin A is metabolized to (methylenecyclopropyl)acetyl-CoA which is not oxidized further but is mostly conjugated and excreted in urine. N-(Methylenecyclopropyl)acetylglycine accounts for about 25 to 40% of such conjugates. 4. Excretion of N-isovalerylglycine is consistent with the inhibition of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase by hypoglycin A. 5. To identify precursors of 4-decenedioate and 4-octenedioate, experiments were carried out using [U-14C]oleate as a substrate on the assumption that these compounds were the products of ω oxidation and subsequent bilateral β oxidation of oleate. However, this hypothesis could not be confirmed. Further 14C from [U-14C]palmitate was not incorporated into adipate in a significant amount."
https://openalex.org/W1518938374,"Abstract Separated, heme-free, α- and β-globins have been prepared from the heme-containing α and β subunits of human hemoglobin. It is shown that the α- and β-globins are different in molecular weight, secondary structure, sulfhydryl reactivity, and a number of other properties from the heme-containing α and β subunits to which the isolated globin chains can be reconstituted and from which they derive. Moreover, the following have been demonstrated. (a) The separated globin chains are folded very differently from one another, although the basic folding features of the parent subunits are highly similar. (b) Removal of heme from the isolated β chain results in a β-globin with an s20,w value of 2.7, corresponding to a dimer. The heme-containing chain is tetrameric. The dimeric form of β-globin occurs in 20 mm as well as 0.1 m phosphate (or Tris) and over a range of pH values from 6.7 to 8. (c) Removal of heme from the isolated α chain results in an α-globin of markedly increased sedimentation coefficient. The value of the sedimentation coefficient is dependent on the concentration of buffer in which the initial globin precipitate is dissolved and against which it is dialyzed. When the initial phosphate concentration is 0.1 m, the s20,w value is 2.5 (corresponding to dimer). At 20 mm phosphate, the value is 6.6 (possibly corresponding to octamer). The heme-containing subunit has an s20,w value of 1.9 (corresponding to monomer, predominantly). (d) Sulfhydryl reactivity is sharply reduced in both isolated globin chains, in contrast to complete accessibility of sulfhydryl in the heme-containing separated subunits. In 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate, all sulfhydryl groups in the globin chains react with Ellman's reagent. (e) In the absence of heme, at accessible temperature (4°) and low phosphate concentration, the isolated, soluble α- and β-globin chains do not measurably combine. Under these conditions apohemoglobin (αβ-globin) occurs as a dimer. An analysis of secondary structure in terms of primary sequence reveals that pros thetic group binding has quite different effects on the two globin chains and that this represents a major influence on the attainment of native structure of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1547665025,"The monomer macroheterogeneity of commercial bovine serum albumin preparations is entirely due to oxidation of the mercaptalbumin sulfhydryl group. When the sulfhydryl group is oxidized to oxidation states higher than disulfide, circular dichroism and fluorescence data show that a tryptophanyl and a cystinyl residue are perturbed. Measurements conducted through the pH range of the N-F transition (pH 5 to 3.5) place these residues in the crevice which is opened up in the course of the transition. Studies with undefatted and defatted monomers indicate that one of the primary fatty acid binding sites is also located in this part of the crevice and that oxidation of the cysteinyl sulfhydryl group alters the binding of fatty acid at this site."
https://openalex.org/W1544641837,"Transcobalamin II has been isolated from Cohn Fraction III derived from 1,400 liters of pooled human plasma, using affinity chromatography on vitamin B12-Sepharose and several conventional purification techniques. The final preparation was purified 2 million-fold relative to human plasma with a yield of 12.8% and was homogeneous based on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and chromatography on Sephadex G-150. Transcobalamin II binds 28.6 µg of vitamin B12 per mg of protein and contains one vitamin B12-binding site per 59,500 g of protein as determined by amino acid analysis. The molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was 53,900 and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 was 60,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis disclosed two peptides with molecular weight values of 38,000 and 25,000 which suggests that transcobalamin II contains 2 subunits. When vitamin B12 binds to transcobalamin II there is a shift in the peak of vitamin B12 absorption from 361 nm to 364 nm. Analysis of transcobalamin II for carbohydrate content using gas-liquid chromatography and amino sugar analysis by the amino acid analyzer suggest that this trace plasma protein is not a glycoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1553308838,"Abstract A method of affinity chromatography which is a potent tool for isolation of the trace vitamin B12 binding proteins has been developed. The affinity ligand was prepared by partial acid hydrolysis (0.4 n HCl, 64 hours, room temperature) of the amide groups of the unsubstituted propionamide side chains of the corrin ring of vitamin B12. The resultant mixture of mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic vitamin B12 derivatives was separated by chromatography on QAE-Sephadex. The monocarboxyl derivatives of vitamin B12 were coupled covalently to the free amino group of 3,3'-diaminodipropylamine-substituted Sepharose using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide, thereby regenerating native vitamin B12 stably coupled to Sepharose (yield = 0.7 µmole of vitamin B12 per ml of packed Sepharose). The vitamin B12-Sepharose bound the vitamin B12 binding proteins (g90%) of human granulocytes, human plasma, human gastric juice, an extract of hog gastric mucosa, and a partially purified preparation of human transcobalamin II prepared from Cohn Fraction III of human plasma. The capacity of the vitamin B12 Sepharose to bind vitamin B12 binding proteins was at least 22% of the total vitamin B12 bound to Sepharose assuming 1 mole of vitamin B12 is bound per mole of vitamin B12 binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1486135597,"Abstract A method is described for determining the equilibrium constant of the tetramer-dimer dissociation reaction of unliganded hemoglobin. The method is based on the large difference between the ligand binding affinities of the dimer and the unliganded tetramer, and utilizes the ligand binding affinity of dilute hemoglobin solutions as a sensitive assay for the fraction of heme in the dimeric state. The affinities for CO of hemoglobin solutions containing 0.05 to 8.0 µm heme have been determined, and show the dependence on heme concentration expected for a tetramer-dimer dissociation equilibrium. In 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0, this dissociation equilibrium is described by a dissociation constant of 3 x 10-12 m. Experiments with hemoglobin solutions in 2.0 m NaCl, 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0, indicate an increase in the dissociation constant to 7 x 10-11 m. The large amount of tetramer present in these dilute solutions combined with the capacity of the tetramer-dimer equilibrium to generate cooperativity in the ligand binding reaction accounts quantitatively for the highly cooperative binding of ligand by these dilute solutions (Hill's constant, n = 2.3). In addition, the ratio of the dissociation constants of liganded and unliganded hemoglobin yields a value for the allosteric constant L. This ratio is 6.7 x 105, a value which is in good agreement with the earlier estimates of L."
https://openalex.org/W1515112027,"Abstract Isolated brush border membranes from rat kidney bind [3H]phlorizin specifically. A binding site (Ka (the association constant) = 5.0 x 106 1 x mole-1 at 150 mm sodium, pH 7.4, 37°) is enriched in the brush border membrane and is not present in kidney mitochondria or red blood cell ghosts of the rat. The concentration of the high affinity receptors in the membrane fraction is 40 pmoles per mg of protein, about 17 times higher than in a kidney homogenate. Inhibition studies with monosaccharides demonstrate that the binding curve is heterogeneous. d-Glucose, d-galactose, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose inhibited phlorizin binding at the high affinity site, whereas d-fructose, d-mannose, and l-arabinose interact with another low receptor in the brush border membrane. The inhibition studies show that its affinity for phlorizin is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the high affinity receptor. The high affinity receptors are destroyed by treatment with trypsin and sulfhydryl reagents like p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid and N-ethylmaleimide. Phlorizin binding is sodium-dependent; the affinity of the high affinity receptor decreases 30-fold when the sodium concentration is lowered from 150 to 10 mm. Kidney brush border membranes contain no detectable phlorizin hydrolase, but the receptors are rapidly degraded by a temperature-dependent process that can be inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The stereospecificity of the phlorizin receptors in the isolated luminal membrane of the rat kidney proximal tubule has remarkable similarity to the stereospecificity of the monosaccharide carriers as shown by in vivo experiments (Silverman, M., Aganon, M. A., and Chinard, P. F. (1970) Amer. J. Physiol. 218, 735; 743)."

This effect represents one of only a few known cases where intrastrain differences in a drug-induced increase in enzyme activity is genetically controlled. The kinetic characteristics of the enzyme from phenobarbital-treated rats are the same, regardless of whether or not the enzyme activity in the liver is increased. It is also demonstrated that rat liver supernatant contains a second NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase which (a) is resistant to induction by phenobarbital; (b) oxidizes p-carboxybenzaldehyde; (c) is relatively uninhibited by disulfiram; (d) has a heat stability different from the inducible enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W943630019,"Abstract The time course of carbon monoxide binding to stripped valency hybrids (αiiβiiiCN)2 and (αiiiCNβii)2 was studied at pH 6.6 and T = 0.05. It exhibits a strong heterogeneous character. Two spectrophotometrically and kinetically distinct forms are apparent. At most wave lengths the fast component contributes about 60 to 80% of the total absorbance change and has a rate of binding similar to that of rapid hemoglobins. Correlation between the spectral properties of hybrids and their fast reacting character is demonstrated. These results are consistent with a scheme where deoxy hybrids exist in solution as two different configurations (R and T) not in rapid equilibrium. There is evidence that the rapidly reacting deoxy hybrids are in a form different from that of the R form of liganded hemoglobin. Upon addition of organic phosphates, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and inositol hexaphosphate, the fast component becomes slowly reacting and the slow component is little affected. Qualitative analyses of the progressive effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate on the kinetics of hybrids are in accord with the suggested scheme. Titration of hybrids with the fluorescent analog of organic phosphates (8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate) shows that 1 mole of anion is bound by hybrid tetramer, and that (αiiiCNβii)2 has the greater affinity toward anions. Some kinetics of hybrids with other ligands (oxygen, azide, and n-butyl isocyanide) have been studied. The reactions are homogeneous and proceed faster when the β chain of the hybrids is free to react, except in the case of carbon monoxide, where the α chains react more rapidly."

https://openalex.org/W1539524160,"Abstract Bovine brain mitochondrial hexokinase, type I, has been solubilized by extraction of the mitochondria in 0.2 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.9 m NaCl. The solubilized enzyme has been purified to apparent homogeneity as shown by ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic criteria. The purification procedure included fractionation of the solubilized enzyme with ammonium sulfate and two successive diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatographic steps. The sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, was found to be 5.9 S at a protein concentration of 1.7 mg per ml. The approximate molecular weight as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 is 107,000. The enzyme has 11 to 13 sulfhydryl residues per mole as determined by reaction of the denatured enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). Almost all of these residues react with DTNB in the native enzyme though with differing degrees of reactivity. Reaction of the enzyme with excess DTNB caused its rapid inactivation. A comparison of the progress of this inactivation with the progress of the reaction of the sulfhydryl residues of the enzyme with DTNB showed that a maximum of only 2 residues could be involved in the inactivation process. If 2-mercaptoethanol is added to the enzyme immediately after complete inactivation, a rapid and total recovery of enzyme activity ensues. These results have been analyzed in terms of involvement of sulfhydryl residues, in the active conformation of the enzyme. Substrate glucose partially protects the enzyme against inactivation by DTNB and also modifies the reactivity of the sulfhydryl residues of the enzyme toward this reagent. MgATP, MgADP, and inorganic phosphate even at 10 mm concentration do not protect the enzyme against inactivation by DTNB. Product inhibitor glucose 6-phosphate affords a complete protection to the enzyme against inactivation by DTNB and drastically changes the reactivity of its sulfhydryl residues. Fructose 6-phosphate is without a comparable effect."

While only 7 percent of the young normals had deficient human growth hormone responses to this stimulus, 36 percent of the older normals and 77 percent of the depressed patients failed to have adequate responses, suggesting an effect of age and a further effect of depressive illness. Because the release of human growth hormone appears to be closely related to brain catecholamine metabolism, the deficient responses in the depressed patients may provide further support to the concept of a neurochemical defect in depressive illness."

https://openalex.org/W1508043013,"Abstract A large number of synthetic polynucleotides and polydeoxyribonucleotides inhibit globin synthesis in cell-free extracts of rabbit reticulocytes; these include poly(rU), poly(rI), poly(rA), poly(dT), poly(dC), poly(dI) and poly(rU, rI). We show that all inhibit by blocking initiation of new chains, and have no effect on the rate of completion of nascent chains. Without exception all polymers inhibit preferentially initiation of α chain synthesis. One interesting possibility is that ribosomes normally are heterogenous in their ability to translate α and β globin mRNA, and that polynucleotides preferentially inhibit α-specific ribosomes. Alternatively, polynucleotides might interact with ribosomes so as to alter their ability to recognize the initiation sequences on the two mRNAs. When the concentration of magnesium ion used in reticulocyte cell-free synthesis is 5 mm rather than the optimal 1.5 mm, there is preferential inhibition of production of β globin chains; the ratio of α to β chains produced is 2:1. Raising the concentration of magnesium resembles in its effects addition of antibiotics which preferentially inhibit elongation of polypeptide chains and also preferentially inhibit β chain synthesis. Both result in more ribosomes than normal on each mRNA. Under such conditions initiation of protein synthesis is no longer a rate-limiting step and the relative production of proteins is proportional only to the relative amounts of messenger RNA. We also discuss some long range therapeutic implications of this work in treatment of thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W1501153189,"Abstract When soluble fractions of rat kidney homogenates were exposed to affinity chromatography columns containing deoxycorticosterone covalently linked to an insoluble agarose matrix, aldosterone-binding activity was reduced by 92%. Similarly, when renal homogenates were exposed to affinity chromatography columns containing estriol linked to agarose, renal estradiol-binding activity was reduced by 93%. Various attempts to recover macromolecules capable of binding steroid from columns of these agarose derivatives previously exposed to cytosol have failed. Moreover, the use of competitive protein-binding techniques to examine 0.3 m KCl or renal homogenate eluted from these columns suggests that most of the reduction in steroid-binding activity which occurred when cytosol was exposed to deoxycorticosterone-agarose or estriol-agarose can be accounted for by the solubilization of steroid from the agarose by the action of cytosol on the steroid-agarose complex. The rate of release of free steroid from the agarose matrix into the eluate was increased between 5- and 7-fold when cytosol rather than 0.3 m KCl was added to the agarose derivatives. The competitive protein-binding technique provides a test for this artifact in the form of a new criterion to be examined when affinity chromatography is used with steroid-binding macromolecules or receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1575915207,"Abstract The activity of the α-glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled amino acid transport systems in membrane vesicles prepared from Staphylococcus aureus is comparable to the transport activity of intact cells. Temperature optima for initial velocities and steady state levels of amino acid accumulation in the vesicles are at approximately 45° and 25°, respectively, and apparent Michaelis constants for the transport of 17 amino acids are in the micromolar range. There are 12 distinct and specific transport systems for the following families of structurally related amino acids: alanine and glycine; leucine, isoleucine, and valine; serine and threonine; aspartate and glutamate; asparagine and glutamine; lysine; histidine; arginine; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan; cysteine; methionine; and proline. Structurally dissimilar amino acids do not alter the kinetic constants for the uptake of a given amino acid, and Ki values for amino acids of the same family are essentially identical with the Michaelis constants for the transport of those amino acids. These findings indicate that structurally related amino acids of the same group are transported by the same membrane carrier. Except for the alanine-glycine, leucine-isoleucinevaline, and aspartate-glutamate transport systems in which d-amino acids inhibit the uptake of the appropriate 14C-labeled l-amino acid, each of the transport systems tested is stereospecific for the l-amino acid isomer. Apparent Michaelis constants for α-glycerol-P:dichloroindophenol reductase and α-glycerol-P oxidation are identical in intact and sonically disrupted membrane vesicles. Moreover, a similar apparent Michaelis constant is obtained for α-glycerol-P with respect to stimulation of amino acid transport. These findings indicate the α-glycerol-P oxidation per se is the rate-limiting step for amino acid transport in these preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1502122559,Abstract Replication of polydeoxyadenylate and polydeoxythymidylate catalyzed by the high molecular weight DNA polymerase proceeds only in the presence of a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide. The oligodeoxynucleotide initiator chain must be greater than 6 nucleotides for poly(dA) replication and greater than 5 nucleotides for poly(dT) replication. The initiator oligonucleotide is incorporated into product chains. When a multiplicity of initiator chains are present (more than 1 per template) then several chains grow simultaneously on each template. The structure and molecular weight distribution of the products may be predicted from the initiator to template ratio.

With v = 0.715, obtained from the amino acid analysis, the molecular weight calculated from the Svedberg equation was 47,900 ± 1,000. Low speed sedimentation equilibrium data gave plots of 1n c versus r2 showing upward curvature with a best fit Mw = 47,000 ± 2,000. High speed meniscus depletion runs gave Mw = 47,800 ± 1,000 calculated from the linear portion of the In c versus r2 plots. Chromatography on Sephadex G-200 indicated that a single protein was present (estimated molecular weight 48,000) showing a distinct Gilbert effect. Disc electrophoresis at pH 9.5 gave a single major band but sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of mercaptoethanol gave two bands (estimated molecular weights 20,000 and 30,000). The larger component incorporated 32P after inhibition of the enzymatic activity with [32P]diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate. The amino acid analyses of protein hydrolysates were characterized by large proportions of glutamic and aspartic acids. Two amino-terminal amino acids (alanine and isoleucine) and one carboxyl-terminal (arginine) have been found. Analyses for hexoses, amino sugars, and neuraminic acids were negative. It is concluded that Factor X activated with Russell's viper venom is a protein having a molecular weight about 48,000 and consisting of two polypeptide chains, which undergoes reversible association-dissociation in aqueous solution. These data are clearly at variance with those reported for autoprothrombin c, an enzyme having similar biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W1495969221,"Abstract Crude extracts prepared by sonicating Candida bogoriensis cells catalyzed the incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-[14C]glucose into a lipid different from the hydroxydocosanoic acid glycosides also formed by this organism. 1-Butanol-acetone extraction of lyophilized crude extract made the glycosyltransferase dependent upon added C. bogoriensis lipids. The active lipid acceptor was purified and identified as ergosterol, and both authentic ergosterol and cholesterol were effective in stimulating glucosyltransferase activity. Incubation of the 1-butanol-acetone extract with UDP-[14C]glucose and [1,2-3H]cholesterol yielded a glycolipid product containing equimolar amounts of 14C and 3H. The product was stable to sodium methoxide but was hydrolyzed in methanolic HCl, and therefore has the properties of cholesteryl glucoside. The crude UDP-glucose: sterol glucosyltransferase was stimulated by ethanol in the range of 7 to 15% by volume, and retained activity in up to 20% ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1576270896,"A crystalline silver nitrate complex of 10-methylisoalloxazine, the aromatic moiety of flavocoenzymes, has been prepared and characterized by x-ray diffraction methods. The red crystals are monoclinic, with symmetry C2/c and unit cell constants a = 10.424 (5) (numbers in parentheses represent the standard deviation in the least significant figures quoted), b = 16.564 (8), c = 16.260 (8) A, β = 116.87 (1)°, z = 8, and ρcalc = 2.06 g per cm3. The structure has been refined to R = 6.5%, using 1432 counter-measured reflections. Each flavin binds to two distinct silver ions. A centrosymmetric square planar silver ion binds 2 flavin molecules fairly strongly through O(4) and N(5); a six-coordinate silver ion lying on a 2-fold axis binds two nitrate groups and the O(2) oxygen atoms of two flavins, and also interacts more weakly with the N(1) nitrogen atoms of the same flavins. The N(3) proton is retained by the flavin, and is hydrogenbonded to nitrate. These results suggest that at least two distinct sites exist for metal-flavin chelation in N(3)-protonated flavins and thus this compound may be a model for the metal-flavin interactions in xanthine oxidase as well as other metalloflavoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1532810936,"Abstract The synthesis of 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine is described. The O2 labile product of the 2,6-dihydroxypyridine oxidasecatalyzed oxidation of 2,6-dihydroxypyridine was accumulated by making O2 concentration rate-limiting in the reaction. Under these conditions a precursor-product relation was shown for the enzyme product and nicotine blue pigment. The product of the enzyme reaction was degraded by cleavage enzyme derived from nicotine-grown cells, but not by crude extracts from noninduced cells. The ultraviolet spectrum of the product of the enzyme reaction, determined in the reaction mixture, is very similar to that of synthetic 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine in the corresponding buffer. Both the enzymatic product and the synthetic product are substrates for the cleavage enzyme; the 4-methyl- and 4,5-dimethyl-substituted trihydroxypyridines are not. These data and the stoichiometry of the reaction suggest that the product of the oxidase reaction is 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine."
https://openalex.org/W1480962327,"Abstract The photosynthetic generation of formate from 14CO2 and an anomalous isotope distribution in the acetate fragment of citrate (i.e. citrate C-1,2) are not compatible with the singular functioning of the Calvin cycle and related processes in the higher plant Vicia faba. Studies of other higher plants have shown that alanine is metabolically related to 3-phosphoglyceric acid by a distinctive isotope distribution in which C1 ≥ C2 = C3; the reasonable assumption has been that these 3-carbon metabolites constitute the major precursors of the tricarboxylic acid cycle during photosynthesis. Inhibitor studies, kinetic studies, and labeled formate assimilation studies demonstrate that formate, rather than alanine, is the precursor carbon source of the methylene carbon atom of acetate; serine is tentatively proposed to be the key 3-carbon precursor of the organic acids. Evidence for a direct reduction of CO2 to formate is based upon (a) the seasonal fixation of as much as 65% of the 14CO2 into formate under arsenite-inhibited conditions of photosynthesis; (b) the specific and mutual competition between CO2 and formate for assimilation; (c) the predominant refixation of respiratory 14CO2 from [U-14C]glutamate or [1,5-14C]citrate into formate as opposed to Calvin cycle refixation; (d) the observation that Calvin-type CO2 fixation but not formate synthesis is inhibited by arsenate or arsenite. A mechanism of de novo formate synthesis is postulated, and a function of formate utilization for the synthesis of organic acids in this higher plant is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2166867371,"Abstract Acinetobacter glutaminase-asparaginase has been shown to consist of 4 subunits (molecular weight 33,000) by sedimentation equilibrium in 5.5 m guanidine HCl and electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate on polyacrylamide gels after cross-linking the protein with dimethyl suberimidate. Moving boundary velocity experiments showed that most of the native enzyme sediments as the tetramer (s20,w = 7.42 ± 0.03 S). On the other hand, equivalent boundary calculations always showed a smaller s20,w. Analytic sedimentation equilibrium experiments revealed a tetramerdimer dissociation with a dimer molecular weight of 69,000 ± 3000. The molecular weight on calibrated Sephadex G-200 and Bio-Gel P-200 was 97,000 and 93,000, respectively, which may indicate reversible dissociation. The hydrolysis of 5-diazo-4-oxonorvaline was used to determine the sedimentation coefficient of the active species. Sedimentation of the enzyme in 5-diazo-4-oxonorvaline showed complex patterns with ultraviolet optics due to protein absorbance. A new double sector cell was devised which allows layering of enzyme into both sectors simultaneously, cancelling the absorbance of the enzyme. The s20,w value for the species which degraded 5-diazo-4-oxonorvaline was 7.6 ± 0.2 S. By matching zone sedimentation and active enzyme experiments, enzyme species smaller than tetramer were shown to have 4% or less of the activity of the tetramer."

https://openalex.org/W1586815101,"Hemoglobin Hiroshima is a β chain variant of human hemoglobin in which aspartate is substituted for histidine at position 146. From chemical and crystallographic studies, it has been postulated that the histidine normally found at this position stabilizes the deoxy conformation by both inter- and intra-chain salt linkages and releases Bohr protons during ligand binding. Previous equilibrium studies had shown that hemoglobin Hiroshima does exhibit an increased oxygen affinity and a reduced alkaline Bohr effect. Kinetic studies of the carbon monoxide and n-butyl isocyanide binding reaction show that deoxyhemoglobin Hiroshima in low ionic strength buffers exhibits behavior intermediate between that of the isolated chains and that of deoxyhemoglobin A at neutral pH. At pH 7.0, the time course of both of these reactions exhibited little or no wave length dependence, suggesting that the α and β chains within deoxyhemoglobin Hiroshima react with ligands at similar apparent association rates. This result is in contrast to previous studies both with isolated chains and with deoxyhemoglobin A at this pH. However, similar behavior has been observed for deoxyhemoglobin A at pH 9.1 and des(his 146 β)deoxyhemoglobin at pH 7.0. Further analysis of the available kinetic and spectral data indicates that the intermediate ligand binding behavior of deoxyhemoglobin Hiroshima is not a result of an equilibrium distribution of deoxy A-like and liganded A-like conformations, but rather represents the properties of a new and distinct protein conformation which results from the disruption of the salt linkages at the COOH terminus of the β chains by either deprotonating, physically removing, or substituting aspartate for histidine 146 β."

Although larval in form and organ differentiation, repeatedly retrogressed insects display a physiological deterioration suggestive of aging. A deterioration of the ability to regrow is accompanied by increasing fat body polyploidy."
https://openalex.org/W2240456210,"Abstract An examination by tryptic peptide mapping and partial sequence determination of critical peptides of hemoglobins from white-tailed deer of known parentage established the presence of from one to three α chains in individual animals. Variations in the deer α chains occur at amino acid position number 20, at which iiα1 contains lysine while iα3 and iα3' contain aspartic acid, and at position number 24, at which phenylalanine appears in iiα1 and iα3' and tyrosine appears in iα3. Either the iα3' or the iα3 chain may appear alone, but the iiα1 chain is always linked with iα3'. Duplication of a structural gene for the iα3' chain, followed by a mutation at position number 20 to produce the iiα1 gene, and a simple point mutation in the iα3' gene at position number 24 to produce the iα3 gene explain the findings with the smallest number of separate genetic events. The lysine-aspartic acid substitution in the duplicated gene product is less conservative than the phenylalanine-tyrosine mutation, supporting the theoretical concept that gene duplication permits a greater degree of evolutionary experimentation. Interestingly, the nonduplicated gene continues to persist singly in the population as well as in association with its mutant duplicate. This finding supports the concept that heterogeneity of the α chain gene loci may exist in man as well."
https://openalex.org/W1535110413,"Abstract The loss of tryptophan oxygenase from rat livers after induction by hydrocortisone treatment was studied in living rats, isolated perfused livers, liver slices and cell-free preparations of these livers. Measurements of the enzyme by its activity and as an antigen were parallel except for apparently nonspecific inactivations in some incubations of cell-free preparations and the temporary, early appearance of a catalytically inactive antigen during accumulation of the enzyme after hydrocortisone treatment. The enzyme was lost at similar rates in all of the systems studied, including cell-free soluble fractions of liver. In all systems, the antigen was preserved by the substrate analog, α-methyltryptophan. The rate of loss was proportional to the concentration of the enzyme and was the same for added or endogenous enzyme and the same in noninduced or induced liver preparations. Labeled, purified enzyme added to cell-free preparations was used to demonstrate that the loss of antigenic material was not significantly associated with its proteolysis to small fragments. The results are compatible with an initial step in the degradation of this enzyme that is akin to a denaturation, and which can be prevented by combination of the protein with its substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1545650067,"Abstract The effects of substrates and inhibitors on the conformation of yeast cytoplasmic pyruvate decarboxylase (2-oxo-acid carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.1) has been examined using the technique of automated tritium-hydrogen exchange. This experimental approach, as used in this study, reflects primarily the number of solvent-inaccessible or core hydrogens in the protein. Yeast cytoplasmic pyruvate decarboxylase is a multisubunit enzyme, molecular weight 208,000, and contains thiamine pyrophosphate as a co-factor at the active site. We find that 850 out of a total of 1600 amide hydrogens are measurable by tritium exchange at pH 6.5, 0°. There are 225 (or 14% of the total) very slowly exchanging hydrogens which we believe arise either from solvent-inaccessible regions of the subunits or from interface areas between the subunits. Upon addition of substrate, pyruvate, inhibitor, α-ketoglutarate, or mercuric chloride, a marked conformational change occurs in which 50% of the very slowly exchanging hydrogens become rapidly exchanging. Lactate and formaldehyde have no effect. Mercuric chloride causes a partial conformational change, but the enzyme is still capable of binding pyruvate and exhibiting a further release of slowly exchanging hydrogens. The effects of pyruvate and mercuric chloride are not additive; therefore, we believe that they are acting at common areas on the enzyme. The enzyme is not dissociated into subunits by the substrate. Thus, this enzyme has a conformationally regulated accessibility to its active site. It is proposed that the conformational changes we observe may be very similar to those obtained during allosteric modification of enzymes and may involve a reorganization of subunit interfaces."

https://openalex.org/W1517690531,"Abstract Extracellular sodium ion was found to be needed for the maximum uptakes of α-aminoisobutyric acid, l-alanine, l-proline, and 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid by the immature rat uterus in vitro. The stimulation of uptakes of these amino acids by estradiol also required the presence of Na+. Uptakes of l-valine and l-phenylalanine, which were not estradiol-sensitive, were somewhat greater in the absence of sodium than in its presence. The uptake of α-aminoisobutyric acid by the uterus increased regularly as the buffer Na+ level was raised from 0 to 143 meq per liter. A Na+ level of 203 meq per liter gave even greater uptake at α-aminoisobutyric acid levels around 1 mm, but it inhibited uptake at higher levels of the amino acid, when compared with a buffer of the same tonicity containing 143 meq per liter of Na+. Reducing the buffer [Na+] from 143 to 4 meq per liter led to an approximately 6-fold increase in the Km of uptake of α-aminoisobutyric acid in both the normal and estradiol-primed tissues. The Vmax values were increased slightly. Decreasing the buffer [Na+] led to these same changes in uteri that had been preincubated for 3 hours in normal medium before uptake was measured. Stimulation of α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by estradiol became greater as the buffer [Na+] was elevated from 4 to 203 meq per liter. At a normal buffer Na+ level of 143 meq per liter, α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake was inhibited progressively as the level of ouabain was increased over the range 0.02 to 0.2 mm. However, the ouabain produced less inhibition at a lower Na+ level, and greater inhibition at a higher Na+ level. Uptake by estradiol-primed tissues was more sensitive to ouabain inhibition than was uptake by control tissues. The interrelationships between the actions of estradiol and Na+ in transport of α-aminoisobutyric acid in the uterus are discussed in terms of an hypothesis that is consistent with the present evidence."
https://openalex.org/W1581540570,"Abstract Proton relaxation rate (PRR) measurements of water were used to examine the binding of a number of ADP analogs to creatine kinase. Values of et, the PRR enhancement for the ternary complexes containing enzyme, metal, and nucleotide, for a series of synthetic analogs, substituted at position 2 on the purine ring were essentially similar to those for ADP. In general the analogs bound more tightly to the enzyme than ADP. However, considerable differences in the ability of the analogs to act as substrates were observed. Relative activities were 2-chloro-ADP (120) g ADP (100) g 2-ethylamino-ADP (22) g 2-methoxy-ADP (16) g 2-methylthio-ADP (5) g 2-chloro-N6-methyl-ADP (zero). By contrast, for dADP, the value of et was considerably less (15.9) than for ADP (23.5). dADP was about 30% as effective as ADP as a substrate. Enhanced values of the PRR were also observed for ternary complexes with IDP and the α-β phosphonate analogs of ADP and 2-chloro-ADP but it was not possible to determine et values for the complexes or the relevant dissociation constants. It was concluded that there was no simple correlation between et and enzyme velocity values for the ADP analogs."
