https://openalex.org/W3104874466,"Cell fate transitions are frequently accompanied by changes in cell shape and mechanics. However, how cellular mechanics affects the instructive signaling pathways controlling cell fate is poorly understood. To probe the interplay between shape, mechanics, and fate, we use mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which change shape as they undergo early differentiation. We find that shape change is regulated by a β-catenin-mediated decrease in RhoA activity and subsequent decrease in the plasma membrane tension. Strikingly, preventing a decrease in membrane tension results in early differentiation defects in ESCs and gastruloids. Decreased membrane tension facilitates the endocytosis of FGF signaling components, which activate ERK signaling and direct the exit from the ESC state. Increasing Rab5a-facilitated endocytosis rescues defective early differentiation. Thus, we show that a mechanically triggered increase in endocytosis regulates early differentiation. Our findings are of fundamental importance for understanding how cell mechanics regulates biochemical signaling and therefore cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W3103754309,"This is a retrospective single-center study of 417 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital in Kuwait between February 24, 2020 and May 24, 2020. In total, 39.3% of patients were asymptomatic, 41% were symptomatic with mild/moderate symptoms, 19.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Most common symptoms in cohort patients were fever (34.3%) and dry cough (32.6%) while shortness in breath was reported in (75.6%) of ICU admissions. Reported complications requiring ICU admission included Sepsis (68.3%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (95.1%) and heart failure (63.4%). ICU patients were more likely to have comorbidities, in comparison to non-ICU patients, including diabetes (35.4% vs 20.3%) and hypertension (40.2% vs 26.9%). Mortality rate of cohort was 14.4% and mean age of death was 54.20 years (± 11.09) and 90% of death cases were males. Chest high-resolution computed tomography for ICU cases reveled multifocal large patchy areas of ground glass opacification mixed with dense consolidation. Cases admitted to ICU showed abnormal levels of markers associated with infection, inflammation, abnormal blood clotting, heart problems and kidney problems. Mean hospital stay for asymptomatic cases was 20.69 days ±8.57 and for mild/moderate cases was 21.4 days ±8.28. Mean stay in ICU to outcome for survivors was 11.95 days ±8.96 and for death cases 13.15 days ±10.02. In this single-center case series of 417 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Kuwait 39.3% were asymptomatic cases, 41% showed mild/moderate symptoms and 18.7% were admitted to ICU with a mortality rate of 14.4%."
https://openalex.org/W3106924629,"Purpose In the management of COVID-19, knowledge is lacking on the frequency of secondary bacterial infections and on how empirical antibiotic therapy should be used. In the present study, we aimed to compare blood culture (BC) results of a COVID-19 patient cohort with two cohorts of patients without detected COVID-19. Methods Using a retrospective cohort study design of patients subjected to BC in six tertiary care hospitals, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from March 1 to April 30 in 2020 (COVID-19 group) were compared to patients without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during the same period (control group-2020) and with patients sampled March 1 to April 30 in 2019 (control group-2019). The outcomes studied were proportion of BC positivity, clinically relevant growth, and contaminant growth. Results In total 15,103 patients and 17,865 BC episodes were studied. Clinically relevant growth was detected in 197/3,027 (6.5%) BC episodes in the COVID-19 group compared to 717/6,663 (10.8%) in control group-2020 (p&lt;0.0001) and 850/8,175 (10.4%) in control group-2019 (p&lt;0.0001). Contamination was present in 255/3,027 (8.4%) BC episodes in the COVID-19 group compared to 330/6,663 (5.0%) in control group-2020 (p&lt;0.0001) and 354/8,175 (4.3%) in control group-2019 (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion In COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of bloodstream bacterial infection is low and the contamination rate of BC is high. This knowledge should influence guidelines regarding blood culture sampling and empirical antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3105442427,"The hippocampus is thought to guide navigation by forming a cognitive map of space. Different environments differ in geometry and the availability of cues that can be used for navigation. Although several spatial coding mechanisms are known to coexist in the hippocampus, how they are influenced by various environmental features is not well understood. To address this issue, we examined the spatial coding characteristics of hippocampal neurons in mice and rats navigating in different environments. We found that CA1 place cells located in the superficial sublayer were more active in cue-poor environments and preferentially used a firing rate code driven by intra-hippocampal inputs. In contrast, place cells located in the deep sublayer were more active in cue-rich environments and used a phase code driven by entorhinal inputs. Switching between these two spatial coding modes was supported by the interaction between excitatory gamma inputs and local inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3103232397,"Autosomal-recessive cerebellar hypoplasia and ataxia constitute a group of heterogeneous brain disorders caused by disruption of several fundamental cellular processes. Here, we identified 10 families showing a neurodegenerative condition involving pontocerebellar hypoplasia with microcephaly (PCHM). Patients harbored biallelic mutations in genes encoding the spliceosome components Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase Like-1 (PPIL1) or Pre-RNA Processing-17 (PRP17). Mouse knockouts of either gene were lethal in early embryogenesis, whereas PPIL1 patient mutation knockin mice showed neuron-specific apoptosis. Loss of either protein affected splicing integrity, predominantly affecting short and high GC-content introns and genes involved in brain disorders. PPIL1 and PRP17 form an active isomerase-substrate interaction, but we found that isomerase activity is not critical for function. Thus, we establish disrupted splicing integrity and ""major spliceosome-opathies"" as a new mechanism underlying PCHM and neurodegeneration and uncover a non-enzymatic function of a spliceosomal proline isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W3109958928,"How and to what extent electrical brain activity reflects pharmacologically altered states and contents of consciousness, is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated whether measures of evoked and spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity are altered by sub-anaesthetic levels of ketamine compared to normal wakefulness, and how these measures relate to subjective experience. High-density 62-channel EEG was used to record spontaneous brain activity and responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 10 healthy volunteers before and during administration of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine in an open-label within-subject design. Evoked signal diversity was assessed using the perturbational complexity index (PCI), calculated from EEG responses to TMS perturbations. Signal diversity of spontaneous EEG, with eyes open and eyes closed, was assessed by Lempel Ziv complexity (LZc), amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and synchrony coalition entropy (SCE). Although no significant difference was found in TMS-evoked complexity (PCI) between the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition and normal wakefulness, all measures of spontaneous EEG signal diversity (LZc, ACE, SCE) showed significantly increased values in the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition. This increase in signal diversity correlated with subjective assessment of altered states of consciousness. Moreover, spontaneous signal diversity was significantly higher when participants had eyes open compared to eyes closed, both during normal wakefulness and during influence of sub-anaesthetic ketamine. The results suggest that PCI and spontaneous signal diversity may reflect distinct, complementary aspects of changes in brain properties related to altered states of consciousness: the brain’s capacity for information integration, assessed by PCI, might be indicative of the brain’s ability to sustain consciousness, while spontaneous complexity, as measured by EEG signal diversity, may be indicative of the complexity of conscious content . Thus, sub-anaesthetic ketamine may increase the complexity of the conscious content and the brain activity underlying it, while the level or general capacity for consciousness remains largely unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W3102905537,"Prostate cancer is responsible for over 30,000 US deaths annually, attributed largely to incurable metastatic disease. Here, we demonstrate that high levels of plectin are associated with localized and metastatic human prostate cancer when compared to benign prostate tissues. Knock-down of plectin inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and colony formation in vitro, and growth of prostate cancer xenografts in vivo. Plectin knock-down further impairs aggressive and invasive cellular behavior assessed by migration, invasion, and wound healing in vitro. Consistently, plectin knock-down cells have impaired metastatic colonization to distant sites including liver, lung, kidney, bone, and genitourinary system. Plectin knock-down inhibited number of metastases per organ, as well as decreased overall metastatic burden. To gain insights into the role of plectin in prostate cancer growth and metastasis, we performed proteomic analysis of prostate cancer plectin knock-down xenograft tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis shows an increase in levels of proteins involved with extracellular matrix and laminin interactions, and a decrease in levels of proteins regulating amino acid metabolism, cytoskeletal proteins, and cellular response to stress. Collectively these findings demonstrate that plectin is an important regulator of prostate cancer cell growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3109139373,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major cause of end stage renal diseases worldwide. Despite successive interventions for delaying the progression of DKD, current treatments cannot reverse the pathological progression. Mefunidone (MFD) is a new compound with potent antifibrotic properties, but the effect of MFD on DKD remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of MFD in both models of the db/db type 2 diabetes (T2D) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes (T1D) models. Compared with the model group, MFD treatment significantly reduced pathological changes observed by PAS staining, PASM staining, and Masson staining in vivo. To further elucidate the potential mechanisms, we discovered MFD treatment notably restored podocyte function, alleviated inflammation, abated ROS generation, inhibited the TGF-β1/SAMD2/3 pathway, suppressed the phosphorylation levels of MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK, and P38), and reduced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition(EMT). In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of MFD in diabetic nephropathy and elucidate its possible mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3110494827,"Objective The aim was to explore the experiences of a person-centred e-health intervention, in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic heart failure (CHF). Design Grounded theory was applied to gather and analyse data. Setting The study is part of a research project evaluating the effects of person-centred care (PCC) using a digital platform and structured telephone support for people with COPD or CHF recruited from nine primary care units in Sweden. Participants Twelve patients from the intervention group were purposefully selected in accordance with the initial sampling criteria. Intervention The intervention was delivered through a digital platform and telephone support system for 6 months. The intervention relied on person-centred ethics operationalised through three core PCC components: patient narratives, partnership and shared documentation. Results A core category was formulated: Being welcomed through the side door when lacking the front door keys . The core category reflects how a PCC intervention delivered remotely provides access to mutual and informal meetings at times when professional contacts were desired to support patient self-management goals. According to patients’ wishes, family and friends were seldom invited as care partners in the e-health context. Conclusions A PCC intervention delivered remotely as a complement to standard care in a primary care setting for patients diagnosed with COPD or CHF is a viable approach to increase patients’ access and involvement in preventive care. The e-health intervention seemed to facilitate PCC, strengthen patients’ position in the health service system and support their self-management."

https://openalex.org/W3103198930,"Human postural control is a complex system and changes as we age. Frequency based analyses have been argued to be useful to identify altered postural control strategies in balance tasks. The aim of this study was to explore the frequency domain of the quiet stance centre of pressure of older adults with various degrees of fall-related concerns and sensorimotor functioning. We included 45 community dwelling older adults and used a force plate to register 30 seconds of quiet stance with eyes open and closed respectively. We also measured sensory and motor functions, as well as fall-related concerns and morale. We analysed the centre of pressure power spectrum density and extracted the frequency of 4 of its features for each participant. Orthogonal projection of latent structures–discriminant analysis revealed two groups for each quiet stance trial. Group 1 of each trial showed less sensory and motor decline, low/no fall-related concerns and higher frequencies. Group 2 showed more decline, higher fall-related concerns and lower frequencies. During the closed eyes trial, group 1 and group 2 shifted their features to higher frequencies, but only group 1 did so in any significant way. Higher fall-related concerns, sensory and motor decline, and explorative balancing strategies are highly correlated. The control system of individuals experiencing this seems to be highly dependent on vision. Higher fall-related concerns, and sensory and motor decline are also correlated with the inability to adjust to faster, more reactive balancing strategies, when vision is not available."
https://openalex.org/W3105112072,"Background Penalised regression methods are a useful atheoretical approach for both developing predictive models and selecting key indicators within an often substantially larger pool of available indicators. In comparison to traditional methods, penalised regression models improve prediction in new data by shrinking the size of coefficients and retaining those with coefficients greater than zero. However, the performance and selection of indicators depends on the specific algorithm implemented. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictive performance and feature (i.e., indicator) selection capability of common penalised logistic regression methods (LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and elastic-net), compared with traditional logistic regression and forward selection methods. Design Data were drawn from the Australian Temperament Project, a multigenerational longitudinal study established in 1983. The analytic sample consisted of 1,292 (707 women) participants. A total of 102 adolescent psychosocial and contextual indicators were available to predict young adult daily smoking. Findings Penalised logistic regression methods showed small improvements in predictive performance over logistic regression and forward selection. However, no single penalised logistic regression model outperformed the others. Elastic-net models selected more indicators than either LASSO or adaptive LASSO. Additionally, more regularised models included fewer indicators, yet had comparable predictive performance. Forward selection methods dismissed many indicators identified as important in the penalised logistic regression models. Conclusions Although overall predictive accuracy was only marginally better with penalised logistic regression methods, benefits were most clear in their capacity to select a manageable subset of indicators. Preference to competing penalised logistic regression methods may therefore be guided by feature selection capability, and thus interpretative considerations, rather than predictive performance alone."
https://openalex.org/W3108003142,"Background Hepatitis B imposes a major public health problem with an increased risk of occupational exposure among unvaccinated health care workers. This study was conducted to determine the Hepatitis B vaccination status, along with the knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding Hepatitis B, among preclinical medical students of a medical college in Nepal. Materials and methods This descriptive study was conducted among preclinical students of a medical college in Kathmandu, Nepal from 6 th July to 14 th July 2020. The whole sampling technique was used. Data were collected using a pretested, self-administered questionnaire which was emailed to individuals and analyzed with the statistical package for social sciences version-22. Results A total of 181 students participated in the study out of 198, giving a response rate of 91.4%. Among the study participants, only 67 (37%) were fully vaccinated against Hepatitis B while 71 (39.2%) were never vaccinated. For the majority (74.6%) of the non-vaccinated participants, the main reason for not getting vaccination was a lack of vaccination programs. Half the study participants (n = 92, 50.8%) had good knowledge, attitude and practice regarding hepatitis B. The median knowledge, attitude and practice scores towards Hepatitis B were 61.00 (57.00–66.00), 20(18.00–21.00) and 21(19.00–23.00) respectively. Conclusions The majority of preclinical medical students were not fully vaccinated against Hepatitis B and only half of them had acceptable knowledge, attitude and practice towards Hepatitis B, which makes them vulnerable to the infection. This might represent the situation of not only Nepal, but also all South Asian countries, and creates concern about whether students take the vaccination programs seriously. Since unavailability of vaccination program is the main cause of non-vaccination, we strongly recommend the provision of the Hepatitis B vaccination program to the preclinical medical students."
https://openalex.org/W3109926811,"Comparing to data in patients with severe coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), there are few studies on the prevalence anxiety and/or depression in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19. We investigated the clinical characteristics and the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and monitored their mental health using an online assessment. An online survey for monitoring and assessing the mental health of patients with COVID-19 using a mobile phone was conducted. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure anxiety and/or depression levels. Of the 234 patients, 66 patients were asymptomatic (28.2%), while the remaining 168 patients were mildly symptomatic. The prevalence of anosmia ( p = 0.001) and ageusia ( p = 0.008) significantly decreased with the increasing age. In addition, 19.8% and 14.0% patients had anxiety and/or depression in the first survey, and one week after the first survey, respectively. Compared to patients without anxiety and/or depression, those with anxiety and/or depression had a longer quarantine duration. We found that anomia and ageusia were relatively common in the young age group. Furthermore, one-fifth asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 had anxiety and/or depression."
https://openalex.org/W3106311311,"Diffusion MRI is extensively used to investigate changes in white matter microstructure. However, diffusion measures within white matter tissue can be affected by partial volume effects due to cerebrospinal fluid and white matter hyperintensities, especially in the aging brain. In previous aging studies, the cingulum bundle that plays a central role in the architecture of the brain networks supporting cognitive functions has been associated with cognitive deficits. However, most of these studies did not consider the partial volume effects on diffusion measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of free water elimination on diffusion measures of the cingulum in a group of 68 healthy elderly individuals. We first determined the effect of free water elimination on conventional DTI measures and then examined the effect of free water elimination on verbal fluency performance over 12 years. The cingulum bundle was reconstructed with a tractography pipeline including a white matter hyperintensities mask to limit the negative impact of hyperintensities on fiber tracking algorithms. We observed that free water elimination increased the ability of conventional DTI measures to detect associations between tissue diffusion measures of the cingulum and changes in verbal fluency in older individuals. Moreover, free water content and mean diffusivity measured along the cingulum were independently associated with changes in verbal fluency. This suggests that both tissue modifications and an increase in interstitial isotropic water would contribute to cognitive decline. These observations reinforce the importance of using free water elimination when studying brain aging and indicate that free water itself could be a relevant marker for age-related cingulum white matter modifications and cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W3108029355,"Background In Bangladesh, about 80% of healthcare is provided by the private sector. Although free diagnosis and care is offered in the public sector, only half of the estimated number of people with tuberculosis are diagnosed, treated, and notified to the national program. Private sector engagement strategies often have been small scale and time limited. We evaluated a Social Enterprise Model combining external funding and income generation at three tuberculosis screening centres across the Dhaka Metropolitan Area for diagnosing and treating tuberculosis. Methods and findings The model established three tuberculosis screening centres across Dhaka Metropolitan Area that carried the icddr,b brand and offered free Xpert MTB/RIF tests to patients visiting the screening centres for subsidized, digital chest radiographs from April 2014 to December 2017. A network of private and public health care providers, and community recommendation was formed for patient referral. No financial incentives were offered to physicians for referrals. Revenues from radiography were used to support screening centres’ operation. Tuberculosis patients could choose to receive treatment from the private or public sector. Between 2014 and 2017, 1,032 private facilities networked with 8,466 private providers were mapped within the Dhaka Metropolitan Area. 64, 031 patients with TB symptoms were referred by the private providers, public sector and community residents to the three screening centres with 80% coming from private providers. 4,270 private providers made at least one referral. Overall, 10,288 pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases were detected and 7,695 were bacteriologically positive by Xpert, corresponding to 28% of the total notifications in Dhaka Metropolitan Area. Conclusion The model established a network of private providers who referred individuals with presumptive tuberculosis without financial incentives to icddr,b’s screening centres, facilitating a quarter of total tuberculosis notifications in Dhaka Metropolitan Area. Scaling up this approach may enhance national and international tuberculosis response."
https://openalex.org/W3108149326,"Gonadotropic hormones play important regulatory roles in reproduction. Relaxin-like gonad-stimulating peptide (RGP) is a gonadotropin-like hormone in starfish. However, a receptor for RGP remains to be identified. Here, we describe the identification of an authentic receptor for RGP (RGPR) in the starfish, Patiria pectinifera . A binding assay using radioiodinated P . pectinifera RGP (PpeRGP) revealed that RGPR was expressed in ovarian follicle cells. A RGPR candidate was identified by homology-searching of transcriptome data of P . pectinifera follicle cells. Based on the contig sequences, a putative 947-amino acid PpeRGPR was cloned from follicle cells. Like the vertebrate relaxin family peptide receptors (RXFP 1 and 2), PpeRGPR was a G protein-coupled receptor that harbored a low-density lipoprotein-receptor class A motif and leucine-rich repeat sequences in the extracellular domain of the N-terminal region. Sf9 cells transfected with Gαq 16 -fused PpeRGPR activated calcium ion mobilization in response to PpeRGP, but not to RGP of another starfish Asterias amurensis , in a dose-dependent fashion. These results confirmed the species-specific reactivity of RGP and the cognate receptor. Thus, the present study provides evidence that PpeRGPR is a specific receptor for PpeRGP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of a receptor for echinoderm RGP."
https://openalex.org/W3108159502,"The modified Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CASA) model based on the comprehensive and sequential classification system of grasslands (CSCS, a unique vegetation classification system) was used to determine grassland net primary production (NPP) in Gansu province from 1982 to 2011 and its spatio-temporal variability. The relationship between NPP and climate drivers was analyzed. The results showed that annual NPP of grasslands in Gansu province averaged 139.30 gC m -2 yr -1 during the study period. NPP decreased from southeast to northwest across the province. Grassland NPP showed an increasing trend during the period 1982–2011, and the increase rate over the whole period was 92.91%. The highest NPP appeared in summer with more precipitation and higher cumulative temperature conditions; while the lowest values existed in winter. The largest correlation coefficient was found between the average annual NPP and the average annual precipitation (r = 0.77), followed by annual NPP and solar radiation (r = 0.70) or NDVI (r = 0.69), Annual NPP had no significant correlation with annual cumulative temperature (&gt;0°C) or moisture index (K-value). Thus, precipitation is the major controlling factor on the average annual NPP in Gansu grassland. Solar radiation and NDVI also have important effects on grassland NPP in Gansu. These results may provide basic information for sustainable development and utilization of grassland and for the improvement and protection of the ecological environment as well."
https://openalex.org/W3109422515,"Though endometriosis and infertility are clearly associated, the pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear. Previous work has linked endometrial ARID1A loss to endometriosis-related endometrial non-receptivity. Here, we show in mice that ARID1A binds and regulates transcription of the Foxa2 gene required for endometrial gland function. Uterine-specific deletion of Arid1a compromises gland development and diminishes Foxa2 and Lif expression. Deletion of Arid1a with Ltf-iCre in the adult mouse endometrial epithelium preserves the gland development while still compromising the gland function. Mice lacking endometrial epithelial Arid1a are severely sub-fertile due to defects in implantation, decidualization, and endometrial receptivity from disruption of the LIF-STAT3-EGR1 pathway. FOXA2 is also reduced in the endometrium of women with endometriosis in correlation with diminished ARID1A, and both ARID1A and FOXA2 are reduced in nonhuman primates induced with endometriosis. Our findings describe a role for ARID1A in the endometrial epithelium supporting early pregnancy establishment through the maintenance of gland function."
https://openalex.org/W3109636987,"We use a 785 nm shifted excitation Raman difference (SERDS) technique to measure the Raman spectra of the conidia of 10 mold species of especial toxicological, medical, and industrial importance, including Stachybotrys chartarum , Penicillium chrysogenum , Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus flavus , Aspergillus oryzae , Aspergillus niger , and others. We find that both the pure Raman and fluorescence signals support the hypothesis that for an excitation wavelength of 785 nm the Raman signal originates from the melanin pigments bound within the cell wall of the conidium. In addition, the major features of the pure Raman spectra group into profiles that we hypothesize may be due to differences in the complex melanin biosynthesis pathways. We then combine the Raman spectral data with neural network models to predict species classification with an accuracy above 99%. Finally, the Raman spectral data of all species investigated is made freely available for download and use."
https://openalex.org/W3106292649,"Objective Through a hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological screening, we evaluated the effectiveness of two months of lockdown and two of surveillance, in Milan, Lombardy, the first to be overwhelmed by COVID-19 pandemics during March-April 2020. Methods All subjects presenting at the major hospital of Milan from May-11 to July-5, 2020, underwent a serological screening by chemiluminescent assays. Those admitted were further tested by RT-PCR. Results The cumulative anti-N IgG seroprevalence in the 2753 subjects analyzed was of 5.1% (95%CI = 4.3%-6.0%), with a peak of 8.4% (6.1%-11.4%) 60–63 days since the peak of diagnoses (March-20). 31/106 (29.2%) anti-N reactive subjects had anti-S1/S2 titers &gt;80 AU/mL. Being tested from May-18 to June-5, or residing in the provinces with higher SARS-CoV-2 circulation, were positively and independently associated with anti-N IgG reactivity (OR [95%CI]: 2.179[1.455–3.264] and 3.127[1.18–8.29], respectively). In the 18 RT-PCR positive, symptomatic subjects, anti-N seroprevalence was 33.3% (95% CI: 14.8%-56.3%). Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Milan is low, and in a downward trend after only 60–63 days since the peak of diagnoses. Italian confinement measures were effective, but the risk of contagion remains concrete. In hospital-settings, the performance of molecular and serological screenings upon admission remains highly advisable."
https://openalex.org/W3107389062,"Context Effective handwashing can prevent the spread of germs, including Covid-19. However, young children can lack a fundamental understanding of germ transfer. A Germ’s Journey educational resources were designed to support young children in learning about germs and handwashing. These resources include a book, website, song, online games and glo-gel activities that are informed by a behaviour change model. Research gap Prior research has not evaluated the impacts of these resources on behavioural outcomes. Purpose of the study Two intervention studies evaluated the impacts of these resources on both knowledge and behavioural outcomes. Method In Study 1, children (n = 225) were recruited from four schools and randomly assigned by classrooms to participate in a multicomponent intervention (vs. control). In Study 2, children (n = 104) were recruited from a museum and randomly assigned to participate in a song intervention (vs. control). Trained observers recorded participants’ engagement in six handwashing behaviours and their understanding of germs. These behavioural and knowledge outcomes were analysed using regression and related analyses. Results In Study 1, significant improvements were observed between baseline and follow up in the intervention group for both behavioural scores ( Est = 0.48, SE = 0.14, t = 3.30, p = 0.001) and knowledge scores ( Est = 2.14, SE = 0.52, z = 4.11, p &lt; 0.001), whereas these improvements were not observed in the control group ( t s &lt; 1). In Study 2, the intervention group had significantly higher behavioural scores compared to the control group ( Est . = -0.71, SE = 0.34, t = -2.07, p = 0.04). Conclusion This research demonstrates that specifically designed hand hygiene educational resources can improve handwashing practice and understanding in young children, and could lead to the reduction of the transmission of disease within this group."
https://openalex.org/W3108304075,"Ectotherms may experience large body temperature ( T b ) variations. Higher T b have been reported to increase baroreflex sensitivity in ectotherm tetrapods. At lower T b , pulse interval (PI) increases and diastolic pressure decays for longer, possibly resulting in lower end-diastolic pressures and mean arterial pressures ( P m ). Additionally, compensatory baroreflex-related heart rate modulation ( i . e . the cardiac branch of the baroreflex response) is delayed due to increased PI. Thus, low T b is potentially detrimental, leading to cardiovascular malfunctioning. This raises the question on how P m is regulated in such an adverse condition. We investigated the baroreflex compensations that enables tegu lizards, Salvator merianae , to maintain blood pressure homeostasis in a wide T b range. Lizards had their femoral artery cannulated and pressure signals recorded at 15°C, 25°C and 35°C. We used the sequence method to analyse the heart rate baroreflex-related corrections to spontaneous pressure fluctuations at each temperature. Vascular adjustments ( i . e . the peripheral branch) were assessed by calculating the time constant for arterial pressure decay (τ)—resultant from the action of both vascular resistance and compliance—by fitting the diastolic pressure descent to the two-element Windkessel equation. We observed that at lower T b , lizards increased baroreflex gain at the operating point ( G op ) and τ, indicating that the diastolic pressure decays at a slower rate. G op normalized to P m and PI, as well as the ratio τ/PI, did not change, indicating that both baroreflex gain and rate of pressure decay are adjusted according to PI lengthening. Consequently, pressure parameters and the oscillatory power fraction (an index of wasted cardiac energy) were unaltered by T b , indicating that both G op and τ modulation are crucial for cardiovascular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3022750740,"We propose to use Twitter data as social-spatial sensors. This study deals with the question whether research papers on certain diseases are perceived by people in regions (worldwide) that are especially concerned by these diseases. Since (some) Twitter data contain location information, it is possible to spatially map the activity of Twitter users referring to certain papers (e.g., dealing with tuberculosis). The resulting maps reveal whether heavy activity on Twitter is correlated with large numbers of people having certain diseases. In this study, we focus on tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and malaria, since the World Health Organization ranks these diseases as the top three causes of death worldwide by a single infectious agent. The results of the social-spatial Twitter maps (and additionally performed regression models) reveal the usefulness of the proposed sensor approach. One receives an impression of how research papers on the diseases have been perceived by people in regions that are especially concerned by these diseases. Our study demonstrates a promising approach for using Twitter data for research evaluation purposes beyond simple counting of tweets."

To address this problem a creep model of coal around borehole was established based on the plastic softening characteristics of coal. The final collapse time of the borehole was determined and used to derive the three stages of the borehole collapse process. The model of negative pressure loss in drainage borehole was established according to the theory of fluid dynamics, the model of methane gas flow and the creep model of the coal around the borehole. The relationship between the negative pressure loss of drainage and the change of borehole aperture was derived, thereby revealing the main influencing factors of the negative pressure loss in the borehole. A drainage technique named “Full-hole deep screen mesh pipe” was introduced and tested to prevent the collapse of borehole and reduce the negative pressure loss. The result shows that after the borehole was drilled, the borehole wall was affected by the complex stress of the deep coal seam, the coal surrounding the borehole collapsed or presented the characteristics of creep extrusion towards the borehole. The “Full-hole deep screen mesh pipe drainage technology” could effectively control the collapse as well as the deformation of the borehole and reduced the negative pressure loss. Compared with the traditional drainage technology, the methane gas drainage concentration was increased by 101% and the gas flow was increased by 97% when the methane gas was drained for 90 days, the gas drainage efficiency increased significantly."
https://openalex.org/W3108033898,"Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) mediate intercellular communication between animal cells in health and disease, but the mechanisms of their biogenesis and function are poorly understood. Here we report that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) nucleolin, which interacts with the known TNT-inducing protein MSec, is essential for TNT formation in mammalian cells. Nucleolin, through its RNA-binding domains (RBDs), binds to and maintains the cytosolic levels of 14-3-3ζ mRNA, and is, therefore, required for TNT formation. A specific region of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the 14-3-3ζ mRNA is likely to be involved in its regulation by nucleolin. Functional complementation experiments suggest that nucleolin and 14-3-3ζ form a linear signaling axis that promotes the phosphorylation and inactivation of the F-actin depolymerization factor cofilin to induce TNT formation. MSec also similarly inactivates cofilin, but potentiates TNT formation independent of the nucleolin-14-3-3ζ axis, despite biochemically interacting with both proteins. We show that 14-3-3ζ and nucleolin are required for the formation of TNTs between primary mouse neurons and astrocytes and in multiple other mammalian cell types. We also report that the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs of 14-3-3ζ and MSec regulate the size and architecture of the TNT-like cellular protrusions of the distal tip cell (DTC), the germline stem cell niche in the gonad. Our study demonstrates a novel and potentially conserved mRNA-guided mechanism of TNT formation through the maintenance of cellular 14-3-3ζ mRNA levels by the RBP nucleolin."
https://openalex.org/W3108263618,"Contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle requires Rac1, but the molecular mechanism of its activation is not fully understood. Treadmill running was applied to induce C57BL/6 mouse hind limb skeletal muscle contraction in vivo and electrical pulse stimulation contracted C2C12 myotube cultures in vitro. The protein levels or activities of AMPK or the Rac1-specific GEF, Tiam1, were manipulated by activators, inhibitors, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and adenovirus-mediated expression. Activated Rac1 was detected by a pull-down assay and immunoblotting. Glucose uptake was measured using the 2-NBD-glucose fluorescent analog. Electrical pulse stimulated contraction or treadmill exercise upregulated the expression of Tiam1 in skeletal muscle in an AMPK-dependent manner. Axin1 siRNA-mediated knockdown diminished AMPK activation and upregulation of Tiam1 protein expression by contraction. Tiam1 siRNA-mediated knockdown diminished contraction-induced Rac1 activation, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake. Contraction increased Tiam1 gene expression and serine phosphorylation of Tiam1 protein via AMPK. These findings suggest Tiam1 is part of an AMPK-Tiam1-Rac1 signaling pathway that mediates contraction-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells and tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3098209899,"Asian-born gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) who are newly arrived in Australia are at a higher risk of acquiring HIV than Australian-born gbMSM. We used a social constructionist framework to explore HIV knowledge and prevention strategies used by newly-arrived Asian-born gbMSM. Twenty four Asian-born gbMSM, aged 20–34 years, attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, who arrived in Australia in the preceding five years, participated in semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Participants described hiding their sexual identities in their country of origin, particularly from family members, due to fear of judgement and discrimination resulting from exposure to sexual identity and HIV related stigma in their countries of origin, although some were open to friends. Despite feeling more sexual freedom and acceptance in Australia, many were still not forthcoming with their sexual identity due to internalised feelings of stigma and shame. Exposure to stigma in their country of origin led many to report anxiety around HIV testing in Australia due to a fear of testing positive. Some described experiencing racism and lack of acceptance in the gay community in Australia, particularly on dating apps. Fear of discrimination and judgement about their sexual identity can have a significant impact on Asian-born gbMSM living in Australia, particularly in terms of social connectedness. Additionally, HIV-related stigma can contribute to anxieties around HIV testing. Our data highlights the potential discrimination Asian-born gbMSM face in Australia, which has implications for social connectedness, particularly with regard to LGBTQI communities and HIV testing practices. Future studies should determine effective strategies to reduce sexual identity and HIV-related stigma in newly-arrived Asian-born gbMSM."
https://openalex.org/W3103791660,"Introduction The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of burnout syndrome among nursery teachers in Belgrade's preschool institutions, and to assess the role of personality traits in its development. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in all Belgrade’s preschool institutions. A stratified cluster sampling method was used to obtain a representative sample. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory- General Survey (MBI-GS). The MBI-GS adaptation was based on an internationally accepted methodology for translation and cultural adaptation. Psychometric properties of the Serbian version of the MBI-GS were analyzed through the examination of factorial structure and internal consistency. A shortened version of Big Five Plus Two questionnaire was used to measure Personality traits. Results Three hundred two health care professionals were enrolled. The mean age was 38±9.2 years and all were female. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the three-factor structure of the questionnaire (exhaustion, cynicism and professional efficacy). Overall, 251 (83.1%) respondents were found to have moderate burnout. In multiple regression analysis, positive valence and conscientiousness were significantly associated with professional efficacy. Aggressiveness, neuroticism, openness, and age, were significantly associated with exhaustion. Aggressiveness, neuroticism and additional jobs showed association with cynicism. Conclusion Present study provided the evidence for the appropriate metric properties of the Serbian version of MBI-GS. Most nurses demonstrated moderate burnout level. Personality traits are characteristics that affect presence of burnout syndrome in healthcare professionals working in preschool institutions."
https://openalex.org/W3107187822,"Introduction Hyperlactatemia occurs during or after extracorporeal circulation in the form of lactic acidosis, increasing the risk of postoperative complications and the mortality rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether continuous high-volume hemofiltration with volume replacement through a polyethersulfone filter during the extracorporeal circulation procedure decreases postoperative lactatemia and its consequences. Materials and methods This was a randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly divided into two groups of 32: with or without continuous high-volume hemofiltration through a polyethersulfone membrane. Five patients were excluded from each group during the study period. The sociodemographic characteristics, filter effects, and blood lactate levels at different times during the procedure were evaluated. Secondary endpoints were studied, such as the reduction in the intubation time and time spent in ICU. Results Lactatemia measurements performed during the preoperative and intraoperative phases were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the blood lactate levels in the postoperative period and at 24 hours in the intensive care unit showed a significant reduction and a possible clinical benefit in the hemofiltered group. Following extracorporeal circulation, the mean lactate level was higher (difference: 0.77 mmol/L; CI 0.95: 0.01–1.53) in the nonhemofiltered group than in the hemofiltered group (p&lt;0.05). This effect was greater at 24 hours (p = 0.019) in the nonhemofiltered group (difference: 1.06 mmol/L; CI 0.95: 0.18–1.93) than in the hemofiltered group. The reduction of lactatemia is associated with a reduction of inflammatory mediators and intubation time, with an improvement in liver function. Conclusions The use and control of continuous high-volume hemofiltration through a polyethersulfone membrane during heart-lung surgery could potencially prevent postoperative complications. The reduction of lactatemia implied a reduction in intubation time, a decrease in morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit and a shorter hospital stay."
https://openalex.org/W3107310477,"Microsatellites are widely applied in population and forensic genetics, wildlife studies and parentage testing in animal breeding, among others, and recently, high-throughput sequencing technologies have greatly facilitated the identification of microsatellite markers. In this study the genomic data of Cervus elaphus (CerEla1.0) was exploited, in order to identify microsatellite loci along the red deer genome and for designing the cognate primers. The bioinformatics pipeline identified 982,433 microsatellite motifs genome-wide, assorted along the chromosomes, from which 45,711 loci mapped to the X- and 1096 to the Y-chromosome. Primers were successfully designed for 170,873 loci, and validated with an independently developed autosomal tetranucleotide STR set. Ten X- and five Y-chromosome-linked microsatellites were selected and tested by two multiplex PCR setups on genomic DNA samples of 123 red deer stags. The average number of alleles per locus was 3.3, and the average gene diversity value of the markers was 0.270. The overall observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.755 and 0.832, respectively. Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) ranged between 0.469 and 0.909 per locus with a mean value of 0.813. Using the X- and Y-chromosome linked markers 19 different Y-chromosome and 72 X-chromosome lines were identified. Both the X- and the Y-haplotypes split to two distinct clades each. The Y-chromosome clades correlated strongly with the geographic origin of the haplotypes of the samples. Segregation and admixture of subpopulations were demonstrated by the use of the combination of nine autosomal and 16 sex chromosomal STRs concerning southwestern and northeastern Hungary. In conclusion, the approach demonstrated here is a very efficient method for developing microsatellite markers for species with available genomic sequence data, as well as for their use in individual identifications and in population genetics studies."
https://openalex.org/W3108904971,"Perineural invasion is a pathologic process of neoplastic dissemination along and invading into the nerves. Perineural invasion is associated with aggressive disease and a greater likelihood of poor outcomes. In this study, 3 of 9 patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and perineural invasion exhibited poor clinical outcomes. Tumors from these patients expressed high levels of MAGE-A3, a cancer testis antigen that may contribute to key processes of tumor development. In addition to perineural invasion, the tumors exhibited poor differentiation and deep invasion and were subsequently classified as Brigham and Women’s Hospital tumor stage 3. Cyclin E, A and B mRNA levels were increased in these tumors compared with normal skin tissues (102.93±15.03 vs. 27.15±4.59, 36.83±19.41 vs. 11.59±5.83, 343.77±86.49 vs. 95.65±29.25, respectively; p&lt;0.05). A431 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells pretreated with MAGE-A3 antibody exhibited a decreased percentage S-phase cells (14.13±2.8% vs. 33.97±1.1%; p&lt;0.05) and reduced closure in scratch assays (43.88±5.49% vs. 61.17±3.97%; p = 0.0058). In a syngeneic animal model of squamous cell carcinoma, immunoblots revealed overexpression of MAGE-A3 and cyclin E, A, and B protein in tumors at 6 weeks. However, knockout of MAGE-A3 expression caused a reduction in tumor growth (mean tumor volume 155.3 mm 3 vs. 3.2 mm 3 ) compared with parental cells. These results suggest that MAGE-A3 is a key mediator in cancer progression. Moreover, elevated collagen XI and matrix metalloproteases 3, 10, 11, and 13 mRNA levels were observed in poorly differentiated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with perineural invasion compared with normal skin tissue (1132.56±882.7 vs. 107.62±183.62, 1118.15±1109.49 vs. 9.5±5, 2603.87±2385.26 vs. 5.29±3, 957.95±627.14 vs. 400.42±967.66, 1149.13±832.18 vs. 19.41±35.62, respectively; p&lt;0.05). In summary, this study highlights the potential prognostic value of MAGE-A3 in clinical outcomes of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W3108471779,"Background Despite recognition of the importance of stakeholder input into research, there is a lack of validated measures to assess how well constituencies are engaged and their input integrated into research design. Measurement theory suggests that a community engagement measure should use clear and simple language and capture important components of underlying constructs, resulting in a valid measure that is accessible to a broad audience. Objective The primary objective of this study was to evaluate how community members understood and responded to a measure of community engagement developed to be reliable, valid, easily administered, and broadly usable. Method Cognitive response interviews were completed, during which participants described their reactions to items and how they processed them. Participants were asked to interpret item meaning, paraphrase items, and identify difficult or problematic terms and phrases, as well as provide any concerns with response options while responding to 16 of 32 survey items. Results The results of the cognitive response interviews of participants (N = 16) suggest concerns about plain language and literacy, clarity of question focus, and the lack of context clues to facilitate processing in response to items querying research experience. Minimal concerns were related to response options. Participants suggested changes in words and terms, as well as item structure. Conclusion Qualitative research can improve the validity and accessibility of measures that assess stakeholder experience of community-engaged research. The findings suggest wording and sentence structure changes that improve ability to assess implementation of community engagement and its impact on research outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3109514034,"Drug sensitivity prediction models for human cancer cell lines constitute important tools in identifying potential computational biomarkers for responsiveness in a pre-clinical setting. Integrating information derived from a range of heterogeneous data is crucial, but remains non-trivial, as differences in data structures may hinder fitting algorithms from assigning adequate weights to complementary information that is contained in distinct omics data. In order to counteract this effect that tends to lead to just one data type dominating supposedly multi-omics models, we developed a novel tool that enables users to train single-omics models separately in a first step and to integrate them into a multi-omics model in a second step. Extensive ablation studies are performed in order to facilitate an in-depth evaluation of the respective contributions of singular data types and of combinations thereof, effectively identifying redundancies and interdependencies between them. Moreover, the integration of the single-omics models is realized by a range of distinct classification algorithms, thus allowing for a performance comparison. Sets of molecular events and tissue types found to be related to significant shifts in drug sensitivity are returned to facilitate a comprehensive and straightforward analysis of potential computational biomarkers for drug responsiveness. Our two-step approach yields sets of actual multi-omics pan-cancer classification models that are highly predictive for a majority of drugs in the GDSC data base. In the context of targeted drugs with particular modes of action, its predictive performances compare favourably to those of classification models that incorporate multi-omics data in a simple one-step approach. Additionally, case studies demonstrate that it succeeds both in correctly identifying known key biomarkers for sensitivity towards specific drug compounds as well as in providing sets of potential candidates for additional computational biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3110366645,"Neuropathic pain (NP) is a common complication that negatively affects the lives of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). The disruption in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn contributes to the development of SCI and induces NP. The calcium-binding protein (CaBP) calbindin-D 28K (CaBP-28K) is highly expressed in excitatory interneurons, and the CaBP parvalbumin (PV) is present in inhibitory neurons in the dorsal horn. To better define the changes in the CaBPs contributing to the development of SCI-induced NP, we examined the changes in CaBP-28K and PV staining density in the lumbar (L4-6) lamina I and II, and their relationship with NP after mild spinal cord contusion injury in mice. We additionally examined the effects of alternate thermal stimulation (ATS). Compared with sham mice, injured animals developed mechanical allodynia in response to light mechanical stimuli and exhibited mechanical hyporesponsiveness to noxious mechanical stimuli. The decreased response latency to heat stimuli and increased response latency to cold stimuli at 7 days post injury suggested that the injured mice developed heat hyperalgesia and cold hypoalgesia, respectively. Temperature preference tests showed significant warm allodynia after injury. Animals that underwent ATS (15-18 and 35-40°C; +5 minutes/stimulation/day; 5 days/week) displayed significant amelioration of heat hyperalgesia, cold hypoalgesia, and warm allodynia after 2 weeks of ATS. In contrast, mechanical sensitivity was not influenced by ATS. Analysis of the CaBP-28K positive signal in L4-6 lamina I and II indicated an increase in staining density after SCI, which was associated with an increase in the number of CaBP-28K-stained L4-6 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. ATS decreased the CaBP-28K staining density in L4-6 spinal cord and DRG in injured animals, and was significantly and strongly correlated with ATS alleviation of pain behavior. The expression of PV showed no changes in lamina I and II after ATS in SCI animals. Thus, ATS partially decreases the pain behavior after SCI by modulating the changes in CaBP-associated excitatory-inhibitory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2975265673,"The disturbance of wildlife by humans is a worldwide phenomenon that contributes to the loss of biodiversity. It can impact animals’ behaviour and physiology, and this can lead to changes in species distribution and richness. Wildlife disturbance has mostly been assessed through direct observation. However, advances in bio-logging provide a new range of sensors that may allow measuring disturbance of animals with high precision and remotely, and reducing the effects of human observers. We used tri-axial accelerometers to identify daytime flights of roosting straw-coloured fruit bats ( Eidolon helvum ), which were used as a proxy for roost disturbance. This bat species roosts on trees in large numbers (often reaching hundreds of thousands of animals), making them highly vulnerable to disturbance. We captured and tagged 46 straw-coloured fruit bats with dataloggers, containing a global positioning system (GPS) and an accelerometer, in five roosts in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Zambia. Daytime roost flights were identified from accelerometer signatures and modelled against our activity in the roosts during the days of trapping, as a predictor of roost disturbance, and natural stressors (solar irradiance, precipitation and wind speed). We found that daytime roost flight probability increased during days of trapping and with increasing solar irradiance (which may reflect the search for shade to prevent overheating). Our results validate the use of accelerometers to measure roost disturbance of straw-coloured fruit bats and suggest that these devices may be very useful in conservation monitoring programs for large fruit bat species."
https://openalex.org/W3099080561,"The impact of global warming on the life of the earth is increasingly concerned. Previous studies indicated that temperature changes have a serious impact on insect sleep. Sleep is critical for animals as it has many important physiological functions. It is of great significance to study the regulation mechanism of temperature-induced sleep changes for understanding the impact of global warming on insects. More importantly, understanding how these pressures regulate sleep can provide insights into improving sleep. In this study, we found that extra sex combs (ESC) are a regulatory factor in this process. Our data showed that ESC was an upstream negative regulatory factor of Heat shock proteins (Hsps), and it could regulate sleep in mushroom and ellipsoid of Drosophila. ESC mutation exaggerates the sleep change caused by temperature, while buffering the shortening of life caused by sleep deprivation. These phenotypes can be rescued by Hsps mutants. Therefore, we concluded that the ESC buffers sleep-related stresses through regulating Hsps."
https://openalex.org/W3102514884,"Anthropogenic derived environmental change is challenging earth’s biodiversity. To implement effective management, it is imperative to understand how organisms are responding over broad spatiotemporal scales. Collection of these data is generally beyond the budget of individual researchers and the integration and sharing of ecological data and associated infrastructure is becoming more common. However, user groups differ in their expectations, standards of performance, and desired outputs from research investment, and accommodating the motivations and fears of potential users from the outset may lead to higher levels of participation. Here we report upon a study of the Australian ornithology community, which was instigated to better understand perceptions around participation in nationally coordinated research infrastructure for detecting and tracking the movement of birds. The community was surveyed through a questionnaire and individuals were asked to score their motivations and fears around participation. Principal Components Analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify groups of questions where respondents behaved similarly. Linear regressions and model selection were then applied to the principal components to determine how career stage, employment role, and years of biotelemetry experience affected the respondent’s motivations and fears for participation. The analysis showed that across all sectors (academic, government, NGO) there was strong motivation to participate and belief that national shared biotelemetry infrastructure would facilitate bird management and conservation. However, results did show that a cross-sector cohort of the Australian ornithology community were keen and ready to progress collaborative infrastructure for tracking birds, and measures including data-sharing agreements could increase participation. It also informed that securing initial funding would be a significant challenge, and a better option to proceed may be for independent groups to coordinate through existing database infrastructure to form the foundation from which a national network could grow."
https://openalex.org/W3105450178,"Infectious disease management relies on accurate characterization of disease progression so that transmission can be prevented. Slowly progressing infectious diseases can be difficult to characterize because of a latency period between the time an individual is infected and when they show clinical signs of disease. The introduction of Mycobacterium avium ssp . paratuberculosis (MAP), the cause of Johne’s disease, onto a dairy farm could be undetected by farmers for years before any animal shows clinical signs of disease. In this time period infected animals may shed thousands of colony forming units. Parameterizing trajectories through disease states from infection to clinical disease can help farmers to develop control programs based on targeting individual disease state, potentially reducing both transmission and production losses due to disease. We suspect that there are two distinct progression pathways; one where animals progress to a high-shedding disease state, and another where animals maintain a low-level of shedding without clinical disease. We fit continuous-time hidden Markov models to multi-year longitudinal fecal sampling data from three US dairy farms, and estimated model parameters using a modified Baum-Welch expectation maximization algorithm. Using posterior decoding, we observed two distinct shedding patterns: cows that had observations associated with a high-shedding disease state, and cows that did not. This model framework can be employed prospectively to determine which cows are likely to progress to clinical disease and may be applied to characterize disease progression of other slowly progressing infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3106555121,"Background Choice of initial antiretroviral therapy regimen may help children with HIV maintain optimal, continuous therapy. We assessed treatment-naïve children for differences in time to treatment disruption across randomly-assigned protease inhibitor versus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based initial antiretroviral therapy. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of a multicenter phase 2/3, randomized, open-label trial in Europe, North and South America from 2002 to 2009. Children aged 31 days to &lt;18 years, who were living with HIV-1 and treatment-naive, were randomized to antiretroviral therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Time to first documented treatment disruption to any component of antiretroviral therapy, derived from treatment records and adherence questionnaires, was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazards models. Results The modified intention-to-treat analysis included 263 participants. Seventy-two percent ( n = 190) of participants experienced at least one treatment disruption during study. At 4 years, treatment disruption probabilities were 70% (protease inhibitor) vs. 63% (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor). The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for treatment disruptions comparing protease inhibitor vs. non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens was 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88–1.61 (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.91–1.68). By study end, treatment disruption probabilities converged (protease inhibitor 81%, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 84%) with unadjusted HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84–1.48 (adjusted HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84–1.50). Reported reasons for treatment disruptions suggested that participants on protease inhibitors experienced greater tolerability problems. Conclusions Children had similar time to treatment disruption for initial protease inhibitor and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy, despite greater reported tolerability problems with protease inhibitor regimens. Initial pediatric antiretroviral therapy with either a protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor may be acceptable for maintaining optimal, continuous therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3107202806,"China has conducted a long-term low-carbon technology innovation (LCTI), but there was a faster increase of CO 2 emission in 2017 and 2018 than in 2016, which has lead scholars to doubt the effect of LCTI on CO 2 emission. This paper builds a spatial auto regression (SAR) model with provincial panel data from 2011 to 2017 to calculate the spatial spillover effect of China's LCTI on regional CO 2 emission. The results show that regional LCTI can reduce the local CO 2 emission, but will increase the CO 2 emission of adjacent regions due to spatial spillover effect. This produces the uncertainty of the promotion effect of LCTI on China's low-carbon transformation. Therefore, this paper suggests innovation resources should be appropriately and evenly distributed among regions to avoid their agglomeration in few regions."

Objective To examine secular trends in patients’ anthropometric indices. Subjects Japanese children with T1DM from the 1995, 2000, 2008 and 2013 cohorts of The Japanese Study Group of Insulin Therapy for Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes. Methods We analysed serum haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events, the types and doses of insulin, height standard deviation scores (SDS), body mass index (BMI) percentiles compared with healthy Japanese children and obesity prevalence over time. We also stratified the patients according to glycaemic control levels of &lt;58 mmol/mol (optimal), 58–75 mmol/mol (suboptimal) and ≥75 mmol/mol (high-risk). Results Data for 513–978 patients from each of the cohorts were analysed. The incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events decreased over time (from 21 to 4.8/100 patient-years), while the proportion of insulin analogue doses increased (14.6% to 98.6%). In addition, patient height SDS (−0.22 to +0.17), BMI percentile (52.1 to 58.7) and obesity prevalence (2.1% to 5.1%) increased. Height SDS increased in all of the glycaemic control subgroups, while BMI percentile and obesity prevalence increased in the suboptimal and high-risk groups. Conclusions Since 1995, the average height of children with T1DM has increased in parallel with increasing insulin doses. Clinicians should be aware of increased BMI in these patients and the associated risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the future."

Taylor’s power law (TL)–a well-established relationship between population size mean and variance across space and time–may help to unveil the factors and processes that determine symbiont multiplications. Recent studies suggest pervasive interactions between symbionts in Drosophila melanogaster . We used this system to investigate theoretical predictions regarding the effects of interspecific interactions on TL parameters. We assayed twenty natural strains of bacteria in the presence and absence of a strain of yeast using an ecologically realistic set-up with D . melanogaster larvae reared in natural fruit. Yeast presence led to a small increase in bacterial cell numbers; bacterial strain identity largely affected yeast multiplication. The spatial version of TL held among bacterial and yeast populations with slopes of 2. However, contrary to theoretical prediction, the facilitation of bacterial symbionts by yeast had no detectable effect on TL’s parameters. These results shed new light on the nature of D . melanogaster ’s symbiosis with yeast and bacteria. They further reveal the complexity of investigating TL with microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W3104545736,"In China, large-area excavation and filling engineering has increased rapidly with the expansion of construction land. The quality of filling engineering is the most important guarantee for the stability of building structures. Among all research on fill soil, the compaction characteristics are significant for indicating the strength and stability of filling engineering. In this paper, two layers of loess fill soil were compacted by a self-manufactured test system with three different compaction energies. Based on the variation in the soil bottom pressure obtained in the tests, the influence of the compaction parameters on the soil bottom pressure was investigated. The results show that the compaction curve can be used instead of the curve of the change in soil bottom pressure with water content; as the soil density increases, the soil bottom pressure increases to the maximum. The relation of the energy consumption ratio of the soil bottom ( σ/σ z ) and the number of soil layers is exponential and reveals the stability of the soil skeleton formed during compaction. This paper describes the compaction characteristics of loess fill soil from the perspective of energy transfer, and the conclusions provide a theoretical basis for soil filling engineering."

Using overlapping reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, the genomic sequences of AdV-1 v1 and v2 were confirmed as 17,646 and 18,578 nucleotides in length, respectively. The two complete genomes contained 9 and 15 open reading frames, respectively, coding for proteins having domains typical of Closteroviridae , such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), heat shock protein 70 homolog (HSP70h) and coat protein (CP). Sequence analysis showed that the amino acid sequences of RdRp, HSP70h, and CP of the two variants exhibited high similarity (&gt; 80%), while their genomic organization was somewhat different. This suggested that the two viral genomes identified here are variants of the family Closteroviridae in a single kiwifruit host. Furthermore, phylogenetic relationship analysis revealed that the two variants had a closer relationship with the unclassified virus Persimmon virus B (PeVB) and Actinidia virus 1 (AcV-1) than with other members of the family Closteroviridae , as did their genomic organization.
