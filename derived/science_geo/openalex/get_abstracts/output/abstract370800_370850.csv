https://openalex.org/W2051181798,"Activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) by chromosomal translocations or point mutations is a frequent event in haematological malignancies. JAK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates several cellular processes by inducing cytoplasmic signalling cascades. Here we show that human JAK2 is present in the nucleus of haematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates Tyr 41 (Y41) on histone H3. Heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha), but not HP1beta, specifically binds to this region of H3 through its chromo-shadow domain. Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2 prevents this binding. Inhibition of JAK2 activity in human leukaemic cells decreases both the expression of the haematopoietic oncogene lmo2 and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at its promoter, while simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1alpha at the same site. Tauhese results identify a previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the phosphorylation of H3Y41 and reveal a direct mechanistic link between two genes, jak2 and lmo2, involved in normal haematopoiesis and leukaemia."
https://openalex.org/W1982326881,"Tonic pain has been difficult to demonstrate in animals. Because relief of pain is rewarding, analgesic agents that are not rewarding in the absence of pain should become rewarding only when there is ongoing pain. We used conditioned place preference to concomitantly determine the presence of tonic pain in rats and the efficacy of agents that relieve it. This provides a new approach for investigating tonic pain in animals and for evaluating the analgesic effects of drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2141674392,"Silva et al. show that CREB modulates allocation of fear memory to specific cells in the lateral amygdala. Reversibly inactivating a subset of CREB-expressing neurons disrupted memory for tone conditioning. Neurons with higher CREB levels were more excitable than their neighbors and showed larger synaptic efficacy changes following tone conditioning. The mechanisms that determine how information is allocated to specific regions and cells in the brain are important for memory capacity, storage and retrieval, but are poorly understood. We manipulated CREB in a subset of lateral amygdala neurons in mice with a modified herpes simplex virus (HSV) and reversibly inactivated transfected neurons with the Drosophila allatostatin G protein–coupled receptor (AlstR)/ligand system. We found that inactivation of the neurons transfected with HSV-CREB during training disrupted memory for tone conditioning, whereas inactivation of a similar proportion of transfected control neurons did not. Whole-cell recordings of fluorescently tagged transfected neurons revealed that neurons with higher CREB levels are more excitable than neighboring neurons and showed larger synaptic efficacy changes following conditioning. Our findings demonstrate that CREB modulates the allocation of fear memory to specific cells in lateral amygdala and suggest that neuronal excitability is important in this process."
https://openalex.org/W174577041,"DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair involves complex interactions between chromatin and repair proteins, including Tip60, a tumour suppressor. Tip60 is an acetyltransferase that acetylates both histones and ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase. Inactivation of Tip60 leads to defective DNA repair and increased cancer risk. However, how DNA damage activates the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 is not known. Here, we show that direct interaction between the chromodomain of Tip60 and histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) at DSBs activates the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60. Depletion of intracellular H3K9me3 blocks activation of the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60, resulting in defective ATM activation and widespread defects in DSB repair. In addition, the ability of Tip60 to access H3K9me3 is dependent on the DNA damage-induced displacement of HP1beta (heterochromatin protein 1beta) from H3K9me3. Finally, we demonstrate that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex targets Tip60 to H3K9me3, and is required to activate the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60. These results reveal a new function for H3K9me3 in coordinating activation of Tip60-dependent DNA repair pathways, and imply that aberrant patterns of histone methylation may contribute to cancer by altering the efficiency of DSB repair."
https://openalex.org/W2003968532,"Sexual antagonism, or conflict between the sexes, has been proposed as a driving force in both sex-chromosome turnover and speciation. Although closely related species often have different sex-chromosome systems, it is unknown whether sex-chromosome turnover contributes to the evolution of reproductive isolation between species. Here we show that a newly evolved sex chromosome contains genes that contribute to speciation in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We first identified a neo-sex chromosome system found only in one member of a sympatric species pair in Japan. We then performed genetic linkage mapping of male-specific traits important for reproductive isolation between the Japanese species pair. The neo-X chromosome contains loci for male courtship display traits that contribute to behavioural isolation, whereas the ancestral X chromosome contains loci for both behavioural isolation and hybrid male sterility. Our work not only provides strong evidence for a large X-effect on reproductive isolation in a vertebrate system, but also provides direct evidence that a young neo-X chromosome contributes to reproductive isolation between closely related species. Our data indicate that sex-chromosome turnover might have a greater role in speciation than was previously appreciated. The discovery of a newly formed sex-chromosome system in a Japanese population of threespine stickleback — but not in a second closely related species sharing the same habitat — provides evidence that sex-chromosome changes may have a greater role in causing reproductive isolation and speciation than was thought. Genetic mapping showed that the newly evolved X chromosome contains genes for male courtship behaviour, whereas the ancestral X chromosome contains genes for both behavioural isolation and hybrid male sterility. These traits contribute to an effective reproductive barrier between this species and the ancestral form found in the Pacific Ocean. Closely related species often have different sex-chromosome systems, but it is not known whether sex-chromosome turnover contributes to the evolution of reproductive isolation between species. Here, a neo-sex chromosome is identified in only one member of a sympatric species pair of stickleback fish in Japan. The newly evolved sex chromosome is found to contain genes that contribute to speciation, suggesting that sex-chromosome turnover might have a greater role in speciation than was previously appreciated."

https://openalex.org/W2159308912,"Rapid chilling causes glycoprotein-Ib (GPIb) receptors to cluster on blood platelets. Hepatic macrophage beta(2) integrin binding to beta-N-acetylglucosamine (beta-GlcNAc) residues in the clusters leads to rapid clearance of acutely chilled platelets after transfusion. Although capping the beta-GlcNAc moieties by galactosylation prevents clearance of short-term-cooled platelets, this strategy is ineffective after prolonged refrigeration. We report here that prolonged refrigeration increased the density and concentration of exposed galactose residues on platelets such that hepatocytes, through Ashwell-Morell receptor binding, become increasingly involved in platelet removal. Macrophages rapidly removed a large fraction of transfused platelets independent of their storage conditions. With prolonged platelet chilling, hepatocyte-dependent clearance further diminishes platelet recovery and survival after transfusion. Inhibition of chilled platelet clearance by both beta(2) integrin and Ashwell-Morell receptors may afford a potentially simple method for storing platelets in the cold."
https://openalex.org/W1969233368,"Earlier, mapping of the 9p23-24 amplicon in esophageal cancer cell lines led us to the positional cloning of gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma 1 (GASC1), which encodes a nuclear protein with a Jumonji C domain that catalyzes lysine (K) demethylation of histones. However, the transforming roles of GASC1 in breast cancer remain to be determined. In this study, we identified GASC1 as one of the amplified genes for the 9p23-24 region in breast cancer, particularly in basal-like subtypes. The levels of GASC1 transcript expression were significantly higher in aggressive, basal-like breast cancers compared with nonbasal-like breast cancers. Our in vitro assays demonstrated that GASC1 induces transformed phenotypes, including growth factor-independent proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, altered morphogenesis in Matrigel, and mammosphere forming ability, when overexpressed in immortalized, nontransformed mammary epithelial MCF10A cells. Additionally, GASC1 demethylase activity regulates the expression of genes critical for stem cell self-renewal, including NOTCH1, and may be linked to the stem cell phenotypes in breast cancer. Thus, GASC1 is a driving oncogene in the 9p23-24 amplicon in human breast cancer and targeted inhibition of GASC1 histone demethylase in cancer could provide potential new avenues for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2008310014,"In India there are very few population based data on prevalence of depression. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of depression in an urban south Indian population.Subjects were recruited from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES), involving 26,001 subjects randomly recruited from 46 of the 155 corporation wards of Chennai (formerly Madras) city in South India. 25,455 subjects participated in this study (response rate 97.9%). Depression was assessed using a self-reported and previously validated instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) - 12. Age adjustment was made according to the 2001 census of India. The overall prevalence of depression was 15.1% (age-adjusted, 15.9%) and was higher in females (females 16.3% vs. males 13.9%, p<0.0001). The odds ratio (OR) for depression in female subjects was 1.20 [Confidence Intervals (CI): 1.12-1.28, p<0.001] compared to male subjects. Depressed mood was the most common symptom (30.8%), followed by tiredness (30.0%) while more severe symptoms such as suicidal thoughts (12.4%) and speech and motor retardation (12.4%) were less common. There was an increasing trend in the prevalence of depression with age among both female (p<0.001) and male subjects (p<0.001). The prevalence of depression was higher in the low income group (19.3%) compared to the higher income group (5.9%, p<0.001). Prevalence of depression was also higher among divorced (26.5%) and widowed (20%) compared to currently married subjects (15.4%, p<0.001).This is the largest population-based study from India to report on prevalence of depression and shows that among urban south Indians, the prevalence of depression was 15.1%. Age, female gender and lower socio-economic status are some of the factors associated with depression in this population."
https://openalex.org/W1990116189,"Freshwater lakes and ponds present an ecological interface between humans and a variety of host organisms. They are a habitat for the larval stage of many insects and may serve as a medium for intraspecies and interspecies transmission of viruses such as avian influenza A virus. Furthermore, freshwater bodies are already known repositories for disease-causing viruses such as Norwalk Virus, Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, and Adenovirus. While RNA virus populations have been studied in marine environments, to this date there has been very limited analysis of the viral community in freshwater. Here we present a survey of RNA viruses in Lake Needwood, a freshwater lake in Maryland, USA. Our results indicate that just as in studies of other aquatic environments, the majority of nucleic acid sequences recovered did not show any significant similarity to known sequences. The remaining sequences are mainly from viral types with significant similarity to approximately 30 viral families. We speculate that these novel viruses may infect a variety of hosts including plants, insects, fish, domestic animals and humans. Among these viruses we have discovered a previously unknown dsRNA virus closely related to Banna Virus which is responsible for a febrile illness and is endemic to Southeast Asia. Moreover we found multiple viral sequences distantly related to Israeli Acute Paralysis virus which has been implicated in honeybee colony collapse disorder. Our data suggests that due to their direct contact with humans, domestic and wild animals, freshwater ecosystems might serve as repositories of a wide range of viruses (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) and possibly be involved in the spread of emerging and pandemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1974321690,"The topological architecture of the cerebral anatomical network reflects the structural organization of the human brain. Recently, topological measures based on graph theory have provided new approaches for quantifying large-scale anatomical networks. Diffusion MRI studies have revealed the efficient small-world properties and modular structure of the anatomical network in normal subjects. However, no previous study has used diffusion MRI to reveal changes in the brain anatomical network in early blindness. Here, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging to construct binary anatomical networks for 17 early blind subjects and 17 age- and gender-matched sighted controls. We established the existence of structural connections between any pair of the 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions using deterministic tractography. Compared with controls, early blind subjects showed a decreased degree of connectivity, a reduced global efficiency, and an increased characteristic path length in their brain anatomical network, especially in the visual cortex. Moreover, we revealed some regions with motor or somatosensory function have increased connections with other brain regions in the early blind, which suggested experience-dependent compensatory plasticity. This study is the first to show alterations in the topological properties of the anatomical network in early blindness. From the results, we suggest that analyzing the brain's anatomical network obtained using diffusion MRI data provides new insights into the understanding of the brain's re-organization in the specific population with early visual deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2167090289,"Mouse models have markedly improved our understanding of cancer development and tumor biology. However, these models have shown limited efficacy as tractable systems for unbiased genetic experimentation. Here, we report the adaptation of loss-of-function screening to mouse models of cancer. Specifically, we have been able to introduce a library of shRNAs into individual mice using transplantable Emu-myc lymphoma cells. This approach has allowed us to screen nearly 1,000 genetic alterations in the context of a single tumor-bearing mouse. These experiments have identified a central role for regulators of actin dynamics and cell motility in lymphoma cell homeostasis in vivo. Validation experiments confirmed that these proteins represent bona fide lymphoma drug targets. Additionally, suppression of two of these targets, Rac2 and twinfilin, potentiated the action of the front-line chemotherapeutic vincristine, suggesting a critical relationship between cell motility and tumor relapse in hematopoietic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2037208645,"Background Recent understanding that insulin resistance is an inflammatory condition necessitates searching for genes that regulate inflammation in insulin sensitive tissues. 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15LO) regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and is implicated in the early development of diet-induced atherosclerosis. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that 12/15LO is involved in the onset of high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings Cells over-expressing 12/15LO secreted two potent chemokines, MCP-1 and osteopontin, implicated in the development of insulin resistance. We assessed adipose tissue inflammation and whole body insulin resistance in wild type (WT) and 12/15LO knockout (KO) mice after 2–4 weeks on HFD. In adipose tissue from WT mice, HFD resulted in recruitment of CD11b+, F4/80+ macrophages and elevated protein levels of the inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFNγ, Cxcl1 and TNFα. Remarkably, adipose tissue from HFD-fed 12/15LO KO mice was not infiltrated by macrophages and did not display any increase in the inflammatory markers compared to adipose tissue from normal chow-fed mice. WT mice developed severe whole body (hepatic and skeletal muscle) insulin resistance after HFD, as measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. In contrast, 12/15LO KO mice exhibited no HFD-induced change in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate or hepatic glucose output during clamp studies. Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in muscle tissue from HFD-fed mice was significantly greater in 12/15LO KO mice than in WT mice. Conclusions These results demonstrate that 12/15LO mediates early stages of adipose tissue inflammation and whole body insulin resistance induced by high fat feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2114085390,"In the more than twenty years since its discovery, both the phylogenetic origin and cellular function of the prion protein (PrP) have remained enigmatic. Insights into a possible function of PrP may be obtained through the characterization of its molecular neighborhood in cells. Quantitative interactome data demonstrated the spatial proximity of two metal ion transporters of the ZIP family, ZIP6 and ZIP10, to mammalian prion proteins in vivo. A subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed the unexpected presence of a PrP-like amino acid sequence within the N-terminal, extracellular domain of a distinct sub-branch of the ZIP protein family that includes ZIP5, ZIP6 and ZIP10. Additional structural threading and orthologous sequence alignment analyses argued that the prion gene family is phylogenetically derived from a ZIP-like ancestral molecule. The level of sequence homology and the presence of prion protein genes in most chordate species place the split from the ZIP-like ancestor gene at the base of the chordate lineage. This relationship explains structural and functional features found within mammalian prion proteins as elements of an ancient involvement in the transmembrane transport of divalent cations. The phylogenetic and spatial connection to ZIP proteins is expected to open new avenues of research to elucidate the biology of the prion protein in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2049291669,"MicroRNAs are required for maintenance of pluripotency as well as differentiation, but since more microRNAs have been computationally predicted in genome than have been found, there are likely to be undiscovered microRNAs expressed early in stem cell differentiation.SOLiD ultra-deep sequencing identified >10(7) unique small RNAs from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and neural-restricted precursors that were fit to a model of microRNA biogenesis to computationally predict 818 new microRNA genes. These predicted genomic loci are associated with chromatin patterns of modified histones that are predictive of regulated gene expression. 146 of the predicted microRNAs were enriched in Ago2-containing complexes along with 609 known microRNAs, demonstrating association with a functional RISC complex. This Ago2 IP-selected subset was consistently expressed in four independent hESC lines and exhibited complex patterns of regulation over development similar to previously-known microRNAs, including pluripotency-specific expression in both hESC and iPS cells. More than 30% of the Ago2 IP-enriched predicted microRNAs are new members of existing families since they share seed sequences with known microRNAs.Extending the classic definition of microRNAs, this large number of new microRNA genes, the majority of which are less conserved than their canonical counterparts, likely represent evolutionarily recent regulators of early differentiation. The enrichment in Ago2 containing complexes, the presence of chromatin marks indicative of regulated gene expression, and differential expression over development all support the identification of 146 new microRNAs active during early hESC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2048397034,"Behavioral transitions characterize development. Young infant rats paradoxically prefer odors that are paired with shock, but older pups learn aversions. This transition is amygdala and corticosterone dependent. Using microarrays and microdialysis, we found downregulated dopaminergic presynaptic function in the amygdala with preference learning. Corticosterone-injected 8-d-old pups and untreated 12-d-old pups learned aversions and had dopaminergic upregulation in the amygdala. Dopamine injection into the amygdala changed preferences to aversions, whereas dopamine antagonism reinstated preference learning."
https://openalex.org/W2045937114,"The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) promotes melanocyte differentiation and cell-cycle arrest. Paradoxically, MITF also promotes melanoma survival and proliferation, acting like a lineage survival oncogene. Thus, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms that regulate MITF activity in melanoma cells. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes are multiprotein complexes composed of one of two related ATPases, BRG1 or BRM, and 9-12-associated factors (BAFs). We previously determined that BRG1 interacts with MITF to promote melanocyte differentiation. However, it was unclear whether SWI/SNF enzymes regulate the expression of different classes of MITF target genes in melanoma. In this study, we characterized SWI/SNF subunit expression in melanoma cells and observed downregulation of BRG1 or BRM, but not concomitant loss of both ATPases. Re-introduction of BRG1 in BRG1-deficient SK-MEL5 cells enhanced expression of differentiation-specific MITF target genes and resistance to cisplatin. Downregulation of the single ATPase, BRM, in SK-MEL5 cells inhibited expression of both differentiation-specific and pro-proliferative MITF target genes and inhibited tumorigenicity in vitro. Our data suggest that heterogeneous SWI/SNF complexes composed of either the BRG1 or BRM subunit promote expression of distinct and overlapping MITF target genes and that at least one ATPase is required for melanoma tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2014235909,"We reported earlier that knockdown of tumor suppressor Pdcd4 (programed cell death 4) downregulates E-cadherin expression and activates β-catenin/Tcf (T-cell factor)-dependent transcription in colon tumor cells. However, the underlying mechanism of these observations remains unknown. In this study, we showed that knockdown of Pdcd4 downregulates E-cadherin expression through elevated protein level of Snail. Over-expression of Pdcd4 upregulates E-cadherin expression and inhibits β-catenin/Tcf-dependent transcription. We then showed that knockdown of E-cadherin activates β-catenin/Tcf-dependent transcription. Conversely, over-expression of E-cadherin in Pdcd4 knockdown cells inhibits β-catenin/Tcf-dependent transcription. In addition, Pdcd4 knockdown stimulates urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) and c-Myc expression, whereas u-PAR and c-Myc expression can be reversed by over-expressing E-cadherin in Pdcd4 knockdown cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that β-catenin/Tcf4 directly binds to the promoters of u-PAR and c-myc in Pdcd4 knockdown cells. Futhermore, knockdown of u-PAR or c-Myc inhibits invasion in Pdcd4 knockdown cells, suggesting that both u-PAR and c-Myc contribute to invasion induced by Pdcd4 knockdown. Taken together, our data showed that elevated Snail expression by Pdcd4 knockdown leads to downregulation of E-cadherin resulting in activating β-catenin/Tcf-dependent transcription and stimulating the expression of c-Myc and u-PAR, thus providing molecular explanation of how Pdcd4 suppresses tumor invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2040293283,"Treatment strategies for the highly invasive brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, require that cells which have invaded into the surrounding brain be specifically targeted. The inherent tumor-tropism of neural stem cells (NSCs) to primary and invasive tumor foci can be exploited to deliver therapeutics to invasive brain tumor cells in humans. Use of the strategy of converting prodrug to drug via therapeutic transgenes delivered by immortalized therapeutic NSC lines have shown efficacy in animal models. Thus therapeutic NSCs are being proposed for use in human brain tumor clinical trials. In the context of NSC-based therapies, MRI can be used both to non-invasively follow dynamic spatio-temporal patterns of the NSC tumor targeting allowing for the optimization of treatment strategies and to assess efficacy of the therapy. Iron-labeling of cells allows their presence to be visualized and tracked by MRI. Thus we aimed to iron-label therapeutic NSCs without affecting their cellular physiology using a method likely to gain United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval.For human use, the characteristics of therapeutic Neural Stem Cells must be clearly defined with any pertubation to the cell including iron labeling requiring reanalysis of cellular physiology. Here, we studied the effect of iron-loading of the therapeutic NSCs, with ferumoxide-protamine sulfate complex (FE-Pro) on viability, proliferation, migratory properties and transgene expression, when compared to non-labeled cells. FE-Pro labeled NSCs were imaged by MRI at tumor sites, after intracranial administration into the hemisphere contralateral to the tumor, in an orthotopic human glioma xenograft mouse model.FE-Pro labeled NSCs retain their proliferative status, tumor tropism, and maintain stem cell character, while allowing in vivo cellular MRI tracking at 7 Tesla, to monitor their real-time migration and distribution at brain tumor sites. Of significance, this work directly supports the use of FE-Pro-labeled NSCs for real-time tracking in the clinical trial under development: ""A Pilot Feasibility Study of Oral 5-Fluorocytosine and Genetically modified Neural Stem Cells Expressing Escherichia coli Cytosine Deaminase for Treatment of Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas""."
https://openalex.org/W2055175949,"Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is closely associated with the development of a vast number of human cancers. To develop a system for monitoring early cellular and viral events associated with EBV infection a self-recombining BAC containing 172-kb of the Epstein Barr virus genome BAC-EBV designated as MD1 BAC (Chen et al., 2005, J.Virology) was used to introduce an expression cassette of green fluorescent protein (GFP) by homologous recombination, and the resultant BAC clone, BAC-GFP-EBV was transfected into the HEK 293T epithelial cell line. The resulting recombinant GFP EBV was induced to produce progeny virus by chemical inducer from the stable HEK 293T BAC GFP EBV cell line and the virus was used to immortalize human primary B-cell as monitored by green fluorescence and outgrowth of the primary B cells. The infection, B-cell activation and cell proliferation due to GFP EBV was monitored by the expression of the B-cell surface antigens CD5, CD10, CD19, CD23, CD39, CD40 , CD44 and the intercellular proliferation marker Ki-67 using Flow cytometry. The results show a dramatic increase in Ki-67 which continues to increase by 6–7 days post-infection. Likewise, CD40 signals showed a gradual increase, whereas CD23 signals were increased by 6–12 hours, maximally by 3 days and then decreased. Monitoring the viral gene expression pattern showed an early burst of lytic gene expression. This up-regulation of lytic gene expression prior to latent genes during early infection strongly suggests that EBV infects primary B-cell with an initial burst of lytic gene expression and the resulting progeny virus is competent for infecting new primary B-cells. This process may be critical for establishment of latency prior to cellular transformation. The newly infected primary B-cells can be further analyzed for investigating B cell activation due to EBV infection."

https://openalex.org/W2030013561,The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway contributes to prostate cancer growth and progression. The presence of robust Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) expression in both normal prostate and localized cancer challenged us to explain the unique growth-promoting effect in cancer. We show here that paracrine Hh signaling exerts a non-cell autonomous effect on xenograft tumor growth and that Hh pathway activation in myofibroblasts alone is sufficient to stimulate tumor growth. Nine genes regulated by Hh in the mesenchyme of the developing prostate were found to be regulated in the stroma of Hh overexpressing xenograft tumors. Correlation analysis of gene expression in matched specimens of benign and malignant human prostate tissue revealed a partial five-gene fingerprint of Hh-regulated expression in stroma of all cancers and the complete nine-gene fingerprint in the subset of tumors exhibiting a reactive stroma. No expression fingerprint was observed in benign tissues. We conclude that changes in the prostate stroma due to association with cancer result in an altered transcriptional response to Hh that mimics the growth-promoting actions of the fetal mesenchyme. Patients with an abundance of myofibroblasts in biopsy tissue may comprise a subgroup that will exhibit a particularly good response to anti-Hh therapy.
https://openalex.org/W1973192869,"The long terminal half life of piperaquine makes it suitable for intermittent preventive treatment for malaria but no studies of its use for prevention have been done in Africa. We did a cluster randomized trial to determine whether piperaquine in combination with either dihydroartemisin (DHA) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is as effective, and better tolerated, than SP plus amodiaquine (AQ), when used for intermittent preventive treatment in children delivered by community health workers in a rural area of Senegal.Treatments were delivered to children 3-59 months of age in their homes once per month during the transmission season by community health workers. 33 health workers, each covering about 60 children, were randomized to deliver either SP+AQ, DHA+PQ or SP+PQ. Primary endpoints were the incidence of attacks of clinical malaria, and the incidence of adverse events.1893 children were enrolled. Coverage of monthly rounds and compliance with daily doses was similar in all groups; 90% of children received at least 2 monthly doses. Piperaquine combinations were better tolerated than SP+AQ with a significantly lower risk of common, mild adverse events. 103 episodes of clinical malaria were recorded during the course of the trial. 68 children had malaria with parasitaemia >3000/microL, 29/671 (4.3%) in the SP+AQ group, compared with 22/604 (3.6%) in the DHA+PQ group (risk difference 0.47%, 95%CI -2.3%,+3.3%), and 17/618 (2.8%) in the SP+PQ group (risk difference 1.2%, 95%CI -1.3%,+3.6%). Prevalences of parasitaemia and the proportion of children carrying Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutations associated with resistance to SP were very low in all groups at the end of the transmission season.Seasonal IPT with SP+PQ in children is highly effective and well tolerated; the combination of two long-acting drugs is likely to impede the emergence of resistant parasites.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00529620."
https://openalex.org/W2010503044,"We hypothesized that religiosity, a set of traits variably expressed in the population, is modulated by neuroanatomical variability. We tested this idea by determining whether aspects of religiosity were predicted by variability in regional cortical volume. We performed structural magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in 40 healthy adult participants who reported different degrees and patterns of religiosity on a survey. We identified four Principal Components of religiosity by Factor Analysis of the survey items and associated them with regional cortical volumes measured by voxel-based morphometry. Experiencing an intimate relationship with God and engaging in religious behavior was associated with increased volume of R middle temporal cortex, BA 21. Experiencing fear of God was associated with decreased volume of L precuneus and L orbitofrontal cortex BA 11. A cluster of traits related with pragmatism and doubting God's existence was associated with increased volume of the R precuneus. Variability in religiosity of upbringing was not associated with variability in cortical volume of any region. Therefore, key aspects of religiosity are associated with cortical volume differences. This conclusion complements our prior functional neuroimaging findings in elucidating the proximate causes of religion in the brain."

In this study, we investigated the efferent projections of PK2-expressing neurons in the SCN through a transgenic reporter approach. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse line, in which the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter gene expression was driven by the PK2 promoter, we were able to obtain an efferent projections map from the EGFP-expressing neurons in the SCN. Our data revealed that EGFP-expressing neurons in the SCN, hence representing some of the PK2-expressing neurons, projected to many known SCN target areas, including the ventral lateral septum, medial preoptic area, subparaventricular zone, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic area and paraventricular thalamic nucleus. The efferent projections of PK2-expressing neurons supported the role of PK2 as an output molecule of the SCN."

https://openalex.org/W2090562686,"Recent studies have shown that the rate of aging can be modulated by diverse interventions. Dietary restriction is the most widely used intervention to promote longevity; however, the mechanisms underlying the effect of dietary restriction remain elusive. In a previous study, we identified two novel genes, nlp-7 and cup-4, required for normal longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. nlp-7 is one of a set of neuropeptide-like protein genes; cup-4 encodes an ion-channel involved in endocytosis by coelomocytes. Here, we assess whether nlp-7 and cup-4 mediate longevity increases by dietary restriction. RNAi of nlp-7 or cup-4 significantly reduces the life span of the eat-2 mutant, a genetic model of dietary restriction, but has no effect on the life span of long-lived mutants resulting from reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling or dysfunction of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The life-span extension observed in wild-type N2 worms by dietary restriction using bacterial dilution is prevented significantly in nlp-7 and cup-4 mutants. RNAi knockdown of genes encoding candidate receptors of NLP-7 and genes involved in endocytosis by coelomocytes also specifically shorten the life span of the eat-2 mutant. We conclude that two novel pathways, NLP-7 signaling and endocytosis by coelomocytes, are required for life extension under dietary restriction in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2019607352,"The F1FO and F1-ATPase complexes of Paracoccus denitrificans were isolated for the first time by ion exchange, gel filtration, and density gradient centrifugation into functional native preparations. The liposome-reconstituted holoenzyme preserves its tight coupling between F1 and FO sectors, as evidenced by its high sensitivity to the FO inhibitors venturicidin and diciclohexylcarbodiimide. Comparison and N-terminal sequencing of the band profile in SDS-PAGE of the F1 and F1FO preparations showed a novel 11-kDa protein in addition to the 5 canonical α, β, γ, δ, and ε subunits present in all known F1-ATPase complexes. BN-PAGE followed by 2D-SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of this 11-kDa protein bound to the native F1FO-ATP synthase of P. denitrificans, as it was observed after being isolated. The recombinant 11 kDa and ε subunits of P. denitrificans were cloned, overexpressed, isolated, and reconstituted in particulate F1FO and soluble F1-ATPase complexes. The 11-kDa protein, but not the ε subunit, inhibited the F1FO and F1-ATPase activities of P. denitrificans. The 11-kDa protein was also found in Rhodobacter sphaeroides associated to its native F1FO-ATPase. Taken together, the data unveil a novel inhibitory mechanism exerted by this 11-kDa protein on the F1FO-ATPase nanomotor of P. denitrificans and closely related α-proteobacteria.—Morales-Ríos, E., de la Rosa-Morales, F., Mendoza-Hernández, G., Rodríguez-Zavala, J.

https://openalex.org/W2099399490,"Background and Aims The familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) gene (MEFV) encodes pyrin, a major regulator of the inflammasome platform controlling caspase-1 activation and IL-1β processing. Pyrin has been shown to interact with the gene product of NLRP3, NALP3/cryopyrin, also an important active member of the inflammasome. The NLRP3 region was recently reported to be associated with Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility. We therefore sought to evaluate MEFV as an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility gene. Methodology and Results MEFV colonic mucosal gene expression was significantly increased in experimental colitis mice models (TNBS p<0.0003; DSS p<0.006), in biopsies from CD (p<0.02) and severe ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (p<0.008). Comprehensive genetic screening of the MEFV region in the Belgian exploratory sample set (440 CD trios, 137 UC trios, 239 CD cases, 96 UC cases, and 107 healthy controls) identified SNPs located in the MEFV 5′ haplotype block that were significantly associated with UC (rs224217; p = 0.003; A allele frequency: 56% cases, 45% controls), while no CD associations were observed. Sequencing and subsequent genotyping of variants located in this associated haplotype block identified three synonymous variants (D102D/rs224225, G138G/rs224224, A165A/rs224223) and one non-synonymous variant (R202Q/rs224222) located in MEFV exon 2 that were significantly associated with UC (rs224222: p = 0.0005; A allele frequency: 32% in cases, 23% in controls). No consistent associations were observed in additional Canadian (256 CD trios, 91 UC trios) and Scottish (495 UC, 370 controls) sample sets. We note that rs224222 showed marginal association (p = 0.012; G allele frequency: 82% in cases, 70% in controls) in the Canadian sample, but with a different risk allele. None of the NLRP3 common variants were associated with UC in the Belgian-Canadian UC samples and no significant interactions were observed between NLRP3 and MEFV that could explain the observed flip-flop of the rs224222 risk allele. Conclusion The differences in association levels observed between the sample sets may be a consequence of distinct founder effects or of the relative small sample size of the cohorts evaluated in this study. However, the results suggest that common variants in the MEFV region do not contribute to CD and UC susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1992975448,"Background The extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) defines the yolk sac, a set of membranes that provide essential support for mammalian embryos. Recent findings suggest that the committed ExEn precursor is present already in the embryonic Inner Cell Mass (ICM) as a group of cells that intermingles with the closely related epiblast precursor. All ICM cells contain Oct4, a key transcription factor that is first expressed at the morula stage. In vitro, the epiblast precursor is most closely represented by the well-characterized embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that maintain the expression of Oct4, but analogous ExEn precursor cell lines are not known and it is unclear if they would express Oct4. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report the isolation and characterization of permanently proliferating Oct4-expressing rat cell lines (“XEN-P cell lines”), which closely resemble the ExEn precursor. We isolated the XEN-P cell lines from blastocysts and characterized them by plating and gene expression assays as well as by injection into embryos. Like ES cells, the XEN-P cells express Oct4 and SSEA1 at high levels and their growth is stimulated by leukemia inhibitory factor, but instead of the epiblast determinant Nanog, they express the ExEn determinants Gata6 and Gata4. Further, they lack markers characteristic of the more differentiated primitive/visceral and parietal ExEn stages, but exclusively differentiate into these stages in vitro and contribute to them in vivo. Conclusions/Significance Our findings (i) suggest strongly that the ExEn precursor is a self-renewable entity, (ii) indicate that active Oct4 gene expression (transcription plus translation) is part of its molecular identity, and (iii) provide an in vitro model of early ExEn differentiation."

Cellular stresses such as DNA damage can lead to p53 activation due in part to MDM2 destabilization. Here, we show that the stability of MDM2 is regulated by an ubiquitin-like NEDD8 pathway and identify NEDP1 as a chemotherapy-induced isopeptidase that deneddylates MDM2, resulting in MDM2 destabilization concomitant with p53 activation. Concordantly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous NEDP1 blocked diminution of MDM2 levels and increased chemoresistance of tumor cells. These findings unveil the regulation of MDM2 stability through NEDP1 as a common molecular determinant governing chemotherapy-induced p53-dependent cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2105575347,"Most human protein-encoding genes contain multiple exons that are spliced together, frequently in alternative arrangements, by the spliceosome. It is established that U1 snRNP is an essential component of the spliceosome, in human consisting of RNA and ten proteins, several of which are post-translationally modified and exist as multiple isoforms. Unresolved and challenging to investigate are the effects of these post translational modifications on the dynamics, interactions and stability of the particle. Using mass spectrometry we investigate the composition and dynamics of the native human U1 snRNP and compare native and recombinant complexes to isolate the effects of various subunits and isoforms on the overall stability. Our data reveal differential incorporation of four protein isoforms and dynamic interactions of subunits U1-A, U1-C and Sm-B/B'. Results also show that unstructured post-translationally modified C-terminal tails are responsible for the dynamics of Sm-B/B' and U1-C and that their interactions with the Sm core are controlled by binding to different U1-70k isoforms and their phosphorylation status in vivo. These results therefore provide the important functional link between proteomics and structure as well as insight into the dynamic quaternary structure of the native U1 snRNP important for its function."
https://openalex.org/W2156242189,"Natural killer cells are innate effector cells known for their potential to produce interferon-γ and kill tumour and virus-infected cells. Recently, B220+CD11cintNK1.1+ NK cells were found to also have antigen-presenting capacity like dendritic cells (DC), hence their name interferon-producing killer DC (IKDC). Shortly after discovery, it has already been questioned if IKDC really represent a separate subset of NK cells or merely represent a state of activation. Despite similarities with DCs, in vivo evidence that they behave as bona fide APCs is lacking. Here, using a model of influenza infection, we found recruitment of both conventional B220− NK cells and IKDCs to the lung. To study antigen-presenting capacity of NK cell subsets and compare it to cDCs, all cell subsets were sorted from lungs of infected mice and co-cultured ex vivo with antigen specific T cells. Both IKDCs and conventional NK cells as well as cDCs presented virus-encoded antigen to CD8 T cells, whereas only cDCs presented to CD4 T cells. The absence of CD4 responses was predominantly due to a deficiency in MHCII processing, as preprocessed peptide antigen was presented equally well by cDCs and IKDCs. In vivo, the depletion of NK1.1-positive NK cells and IKDCs reduced the expansion of viral nucleoprotein-specific CD8 T cells in the lung and spleen, but did finally not affect viral clearance from the lung. In conclusion, we found evidence for APC function of lung NK cells during influenza infection, but this is a feature not exclusive to the IKDC subset."

They are 10-14 amino acid long polypeptides active prevalently against gram positive bacteria. This study shows that a synthetic temporin B analogue (TB-YK), acquires the capacity to act in synergism with temporin A and to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity in vivo against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Administration of 3.4 mg/Kg of temporin A (TA)+1.6 mg/Kg TB-YK, given to individual mice concurrently with a lethal dose of bacteria (gram positive or negative), rescued 100% of the animals. More importantly, the same doses of temporins, administered one week after experimental infection with a sub lethal dose of bacteria, sterilized 100% of the animals within 3-6 days. Also, it is described an animal model based on the use of sub lethal doses of bacteria, which closely mimics bacterial infection in humans. The model offers the possibility to test in a preclinical setting the true potential of TA and TB-YK in combination as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents."

https://openalex.org/W1991320024,"Most of the targeting moieties, such as antibody fragments or growth factor domains, used to construct targeted toxins for anticancer therapy derive from secretory proteins. These normally fold in the oxidative environment of the endoplasmic reticulum, and hence their folding in bacterial cells can be quite inefficient. For instance, only low amounts of properly folded antimetastatic chimera constituted by the amino-terminal fragment of human urokinase (ATF) fused to the plant ribosome-inactivating protein saporin could be recovered. ATF-saporin was instead secreted efficiently when expressed in eukaryotic cells protected from autointoxication with neutralizing anti-saporin antibodies. Pichia pastoris is a microbial eukaryotic host where these domains can fold into a transport-competent conformation and reach the extracellular medium. We show here that despite some host toxicity codon-usage optimization greatly increased the expression levels of active saporin but not those of an active-site mutant SAP-KQ in GS115 (his4) strain. The lack of any toxicity associated with expression of the latter confirmed that toxicity is due to saporin catalytic activity. Nevertheless, GS115 (his4) cells in flask culture secreted 3.5 mg/L of a histidine-tagged ATF-saporin chimera showing an IC(50) of 6 x 10(-11) M against U937 cells, thus demonstrating the suitability of this expression platform for secretion of toxic saporin-based chimeras."
https://openalex.org/W2076502861,"Phosphagen kinase (PK) family members catalyze the reversible phosphoryl transfer between phosphagen and ADP to reserve or release energy in cell energy metabolism. The structures of classic quaternary complexes of dimeric creatine kinase (CK) revealed asymmetric ligand binding states of two protomers, but the significance and mechanism remain unclear. To understand this negative cooperativity further, we determined the first structure of dimeric arginine kinase (dAK), another PK family member, at 1.75 A, as well as the structure of its ternary complex with AMPPNP and arginine. Further structural analysis shows that the ligand-free protomer in a ligand-bound dimer opens more widely than the protomers in a ligand-free dimer, which leads to three different states of a dAK protomer. The unexpected allostery of the ligand-free protomer in a ligand-bound dimer should be relayed from the ligand-binding-induced allostery of its adjacent protomer. Mutations that weaken the inter-protomer connections dramatically reduced the catalytic activities of dAK, indicating the importance of the allosteric propagation mediated by the homodimer interface. These results suggest a reciprocating mechanism of dimeric PK, which is shared by other ATP related oligomeric enzymes, e.g., ATP synthase.—Wu, X., Ye, S., Guo, S., Yan, W., Bartlam, M., Rao, Z.

The role of ADP in platelet biology has been extensively studied, yet ADP signaling pathways in endothelial cells remain incompletely understood. We found that ADP promoted phosphorylation of the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) at Ser1179 and Ser635 and dephosphorylation at Ser116 in cultured endothelial cells. Although eNOS activity was stimulated by both ADP and ATP, only ADP signaling was significantly inhibited by the P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS 2179 or by knockdown of P2Y1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA). ADP activated the small GTPase Rac1 and promoted endothelial cell migration. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rac1 blocked ADP-dependent eNOS Ser1179 and Ser635 phosphorylation, as well as eNOS activation.

Purine nucleotides have long been known to play critical intracellular roles in nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism, yet these nucleotides also serve as important extracellular signaling molecules. Nucleotides such as ADP and ATP regulate vascular homeostasis through their activation of a family of selective cell surface receptors located on platelets, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (1.Burnstock G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Receptors for purine nucleotides include the G protein-coupled P2Y receptors and the ligand-gated P2X ion channel receptors. Upon binding to their cognate receptors, purine nucleotides exert their effects via multiple second messenger pathways, including mobilization of intracellular calcium and alterations in cyclic nucleotides. Receptors for extracellular nucleotides have been found in many different cell types (2.Dubyak G.R. el-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and purinergic signaling is especially important in the maintenance of vascular tone and function. More than 80 years ago, purine nucleotides were found to cause vasodilatation and hypotension (3.Drury A.N. Szent-Györgyi A. J. Physiol. 1929; 68: 213-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), yet the signaling pathways activated by purinergic receptors in the vasculature have turned out to be complex and are not fully understood. Different vascular responses are elicited depending on the source of the nucleotide agonist, the target cell, and the receptor subtype. To date, most attention has been focused on the roles of ATP and UTP in the vasculature. For example, ATP has been shown to promote vasoconstriction through P2X1 receptors located on vascular smooth muscle cells (4.Erlinge D. Burnstock G. Purinergic Signal. 2008; 4: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), whereas in endothelial cells, ATP-dependent activation of P2X4 receptors promotes vasodilation in the context of shear stress (5.Yamamoto K.

In contrast to the numerous studies of vascular responses to ATP, ADP signaling in the vessel wall has not been extensively investigated. There have been recent studies showing that ADP mediates vasoconstriction via P2Y12 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells and stimulates endothelial cell migration through P2Y1 receptor-mediated pathways (9.Wihlborg A.K.

Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, ADP signaling pathways in the endothelium remain incompletely characterized. Importantly, endothelial cells can respond to ADP released by red blood cells and platelets, and endothelial cells themselves can release purine nucleotides in an autocrine signaling pathway (4.Erlinge D. Burnstock G. Purinergic Signal. 2008; 4: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 11.LeRoy E.C. Ager A. Gordon J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 74: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The proximity of the endothelium to cellular sources of ADP, as well as the widespread use of ADP receptor antagonists in cardiovascular therapeutics, led us to explore the molecular mechanisms mediating these paracrine and autocrine effects of ADP in endothelial cells.

Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3210-3216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Activation of different cell surface receptors elicits distinct kinase pathways associated with eNOS activation, yet the roles of these various kinase pathways or of Rac1 in mediating endothelial ADP responses have not been fully elucidated. Significantly, nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by activated eNOS promotes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation/migration, and blocks platelet aggregation (26.Loscalzo J. Welch G. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). NO also regulates endothelial cell survival and migration (27.Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Masini E. Amerini S.

Given the overlap in physiological responses of vascular cells to NO and ADP, we considered eNOS a plausible candidate mediator of ADP effects on the endothelium. The present studies investigated the signaling pathways involved in ADP-induced modulation of eNOS and cell migration in cultured endothelial cells. We provide evidence that distinguishes ADP from ATP responses in these cells and show data to suggest that it is the expression, rather than the kinase activity, of AMPK and CaMKKβ that is necessary for the ability of ADP to regulate eNOS activity. Furthermore, we establish Rac1 as a critical mediator of ADP signaling to eNOS, as well as ADP-induced cell migration, and we propose a critical role for Rac1 in purinergic control of NO-dependent pathways and cellular responses in the vascular endothelium.

Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied prior to cell confluence between passages 6 and 8. siRNA transfections were performed as described previously (29.Gonzalez E.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 30 nm siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (0.15%, v/v) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer 24 h after cells were split at a 1:8 ratio. Lipofectamine 2000 was then removed by changing into fresh medium containing 10% FBS 5 h after transfection. ADP, ATP, MRS 2179, and epinephrine were solubilized in water and stored at −20 °C. S1P was solubilized in methanol and stored at −20 °C. The same volume of methanol was used as vehicle control, and the final concentration of methanol did not exceed 0.4% (v/v).

After drug treatments, lysates from BAEC were prepared using a cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.025% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Immunoblot analyses of protein expression and phosphorylation were assessed as described previously (30.Levine Y.C. Li G.K. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20351-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Determinations of protein abundance using immunoblot analyses were quantitated using a ChemiImager HD4000 (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). Experimental oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). We designed a P2Y1 receptor duplex siRNA construct corresponding to positions 639–657 from the open reading frame of bovine P2Y1: 5′-CCGUGUACAUGUUCAACUUdTdT-3′ (GenBankTM accession number NM_174410.2). siRNA constructs targeting CaMKKβ, AMPKα1, PKA, Rac1, and eNOS have been previously described in detail and validated (25.Gonzalez E. Kou R. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3210-3216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30.Levine Y.C. Li G.K. Michel T. J. Biol.

The nonspecific control siRNA 5′-AUUGUAUGCGAUCGCAGAC-dTdT-3′ was from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). eNOS activity was quantitated by measuring the formation of l-[3H]citrulline from l-[3H]arginine as described previously (32.Kou R. Igarashi J. Michel T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4982-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was initiated in cultured BAEC by adding l-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml, diluted with unlabeled l-arginine to give a final concentration of 10 μm) plus various drug treatments. Each treatment was performed in triplicate cultures, which were analyzed in duplicate. NOS activity, measured as l-citrulline formation, was expressed as pmol of l-citrulline produced/mg of cellular protein/min. BAEC in 100-mm dishes were treated with agonists as indicated, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The Rac1 activity assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor were added to the lysis buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. Pulldown of the GTP-bound active form of Rac1 was performed by incubating the cell lysates with glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to the p21-binding domain of PAK-1 bound to glutathione-agarose. The beads were washed once with washing buffer provided in the assay kit, and the proteins bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed for the amount of GTP-bound Rac in immunoblots probed with a Rac monoclonal antibody supplied by the manufacturer. Cell migration was assayed using a Transwell cell culture chamber containing polycarbonate membrane inserts with 8-μm pore size (Corning Costar Corp.) BAEC were transfected with control or specific siRNA as indicated, and experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. 18 h prior to experimentation, the medium was changed, and cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.4% FBS. Cells were incubated with trypsin to obtain a monodispersed suspension, and 5 × 104 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.4% FBS were added to the upper Transwell chamber. The bottom chamber was filled with 600 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.4% FBS, and the assembly was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow cells to adhere to the membrane. Vehicle, S1P, or ADP was added to the lower chamber, and the chambers were incubated at 37 °C overnight to allow cell migration. The Transwell inserts were transferred into a new plate containing 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution to detach the cells from the membrane. Cells in the lower chamber were counted with a hemocytometer. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, and each sample was counted twice in four 4 × 4 square fields. To assess cell proliferation, BAEC were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well; each determination was measured in triplicate in two independent experiments. Cells were treated with 50 μm ADP or vehicle overnight and labeled for 4 h with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and washed with water; incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined in a scintillation counter. BAEC were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline containing phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm NaVO3 and 1 mm NaF), pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in OG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mm octyl glucopyranoside, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NaVO3, 1 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor). Suspensions were rotated end over end at 4 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °C with a previously characterized rabbit eNOS polyclonal antiserum (33.Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Robinson L.J. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) at a final dilution of 1:100. Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added for 1 h. After 1 h, immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times in OG lysis buffer, eluted from the beads in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min at 95 °C, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and probed in immunoblots as shown. All experiments were performed at least three times. Mean values for experiments were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were assessed by analysis of variance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fig. 1 shows the effects of ADP on the phosphorylation of several key endothelial signaling proteins. ADP-treated endothelial cells were analyzed in immunoblots probed with phosphorylation state-specific antibodies directed against eNOS, AMPK, Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2. In each case, the immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies directed against the corresponding total protein to verify equal loading under the different conditions studied. ADP promoted the dose-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at residues Ser1179 and Ser635, AMPK (Thr172), kinase Akt (Ser473), GSK3β (Ser9), and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), as well as dephosphorylation of eNOS at Ser116 (Fig. 1, A–C). The dose response for these ADP-modulated phosphorylation responses demonstrated an EC50 of ∼15 μm, a concentration that is within the physiological range of ADP in plasma (35.Mills D.C. Robb I.A. Roberts G.C. J. Physiol. 1968; 195: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 36.Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). The time course of these ADP-dependent phosphorylation responses is shown in Fig. 1, D–F. The addition of 15 μm ADP to BAEC resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1179 within 2 min of agonist addition. ADP also robustly stimulated the phosphorylation of AMPK, GSK3β, and ERK1/2 with a similar temporal pattern. The peak of ADP-promoted phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS Ser635 was reached only at ∼15 min after agonist addition. All of these phosphorylation responses returned close to basal levels by 40 min. However, ADP-promoted dephosphorylation of eNOS at Ser116, which occurred within 2 min of adding ADP to the cells, persisted throughout the time course studied and achieved a persistent 80% decrease in phosphorylation. Together, these data indicate that ADP modulates the reversible phosphorylation of multiple residues on eNOS, as well as critical residues on AMPK, Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2 in endothelial cells. Our finding such robust phosphorylation responses to ADP (Fig. 1) led to our performing experiments to determine the receptor subtype mediating the ADP response. This is particularly important in the context of the well known ATP responses in the vascular wall: both ATP and ADP are abundant, and ATP can easily be converted to ADP by ectonucleotidases. Indeed, we found that both ADP and ATP increased eNOS activity, as measured using the l-[3H]arginine-[3H]citrulline assay (Fig. 2A). To characterize the receptor subtype that mediates ADP signaling to eNOS, BAEC were pretreated with the P2Y1-selective antagonist MRS 2179 before the addition of ADP or ATP (37.Baurand A. Gachet C. Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 2003; 21: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, MRS 2179 inhibited ADP- but not ATP-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1179 and AMPK, as well as dephosphorylation of eNOS Ser116. Furthermore, there was no effect of MRS 2179 on ATP-stimulated eNOS activation, whereas P2Y1 antagonism with MRS 2179 effectively blocked ADP-promoted eNOS activation (p < 0.05, n = 3) with an IC50 of ∼2 μm (Fig. 2D). We also found that these ADP responses were unaffected by pertussis toxin (data not shown), a finding consistent with prior reports that have shown that ADP signaling in the vascular wall is pertussis toxin-insensitive (38.Shimokawa H. Flavahan N.A. Vanhoutte P.M. Circulation. 1991; 83: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To provide additional independent evidence for the involvement of P2Y1 in the ADP response, we designed a duplex siRNA construct targeting the P2Y1 receptor (Fig. 2, E–G). siRNA-mediated knockdown of P2Y1 blocked ADP-promoted eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1179 (Fig. 2F) and Ser635, as well as dephosphorylation at eNOS Ser116. As shown in Fig. 2G, P2Y1 siRNA inhibited the ability of ADP to increase eNOS activity (p < 0.05, n = 3). However, knockdown of P2Y1 had no effect on the phosphorylation or activation of eNOS after ATP treatment (Fig. 2, E–G). Multiple protein kinases have been shown to be involved in the regulation of eNOS, including protein kinase Akt (14.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), Src tyrosine kinase (39.Haynes M.P. Li L. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Hisamoto K. Baron R. Collinge M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2118-2123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and MAPK (21.Cale J.M. Bird I.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) among others. We therefore used a series of pharmacological inhibitors to systematically assess the potential contribution of each of these pathways to ADP responses in endothelial cells. S1P, a sphingolipid that potently activates eNOS via a G protein-coupled receptor, was used in these pharmacologic studies as a positive control. BAEC were stimulated with agonists after pretreatment with each of the following inhibitors: wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), PP2 (Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and PD98059 (MAPK kinase inhibitor). We found that both wortmannin and PP2 significantly blocked S1P-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1179 (Fig. 3, A, B, E, and F) and GSK3β (Fig. 3, D and G). Despite the marked inhibition of ADP-mediated GSK3β phosphorylation following wortmannin treatment (Fig. 3D), wortmannin did not affect ADP-promoted changes in eNOS phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C). Similarly, PD98059 treatment inhibited basal as well as ADP- and S1P-modulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, H and J) but failed to significantly alter eNOS phosphorylation responses to these agonists (Fig. 3I). Taken together, these data suggested that PI3K/Akt, Src, and MAPK pathways are not importantly involved in mediating ADP-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS and led us to additional experiments to explore the pathways connecting ADP and eNOS modulation. The next series of studies investigated phospholipid- and calcium-associated pathways that ha"
https://openalex.org/W1995602050,"BtubA and BtubB are two tubulin-like genes found in the bacterium Prosthecobacter. Our work and a previous crystal structure suggest that BtubB corresponds to alpha-tubulin and BtubA to beta-tubulin. A 1:1 mixture of the two proteins assembles into tubulin-like protofilaments, which further aggregate into pairs and bundles. The proteins also form a BtubA/B heterodimer, which appears to be a repeating subunit in the protofilament.We have designed point mutations to disrupt the longitudinal interfaces bonding subunits into protofilaments. The mutants are in two classes, within dimers and between dimers. We have characterized one mutant of each class for BtubA and BtubB. When mixed 1:1 with a wild type partner, none of the mutants were capable of assembly. An excess of between-dimer mutants could depolymerize preformed wild type polymers, while within-dimer mutants had no activity.An essential first step in assembly of BtubA + BtubB is formation of a heterodimer. An excess of between-dimer mutants depolymerize wild type BtubA/B by sequestering the partner wild type subunit into inactive dimers. Within-dimer mutants cannot form dimers and have no activity."
https://openalex.org/W2086052543,"Background Duplex real-time PCR assays have been widely used to determine amounts and concentrations of free circulating DNA in human blood plasma samples. Circulatory plasma DNA is highly fragmented and hence a PCR-based determination of DNA concentration may be affected by the limited availability of full-length targets in the DNA sample. This leads to inaccuracies when counting PCR target copy numbers as whole genome equivalents. Methodology/Principal Findings A model system was designed allowing for assessment of bias in a duplex real-time PCR research assay. We collected blood plasma samples from male donors in pools of 6 to 8 individuals. Circulatory plasma DNA was extracted and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Separated DNA was recovered from the gel in discrete size fractions and analyzed with different duplex real-time PCR Taqman assays detecting a Y chromosome-specific target and an autosomal target. The real-time PCR research assays used differed significantly in their ability to determine the correct copy number ratio of 0.5 between Y chromosome and autosome targets in DNA of male origin. Longer PCR targets did not amplify quantitatively in circulatory DNA, due to limited presence of full-length target sequence in the sample. Conclusions PCR targets of the same small size are preferred over longer targets when comparing fractional circulatory DNA concentrations by real-time PCR. As an example, a DYS14/18S duplex real-time PCR research assay is presented that correctly measures the fractional concentration of male DNA in a male/female mixture of circulatory, fragmented DNA."

Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury produces excessive poly[ADP-Ribose] Polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation. The present study explored the hypothesis that increased tubular expression of PARP-1 contributes to delayed renal function in suboptimal ECD kidney allografts and in non-ECD allografts that develop posttransplant acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Materials and Methods Nuclear PARP-1 immunohistochemical expression was studied in 326 paraffin-embedded renal allograft biopsies (193 with different degrees of ATN and 133 controls) and in murine Parp-1 knockout model of IR injury. Results PARP-1 expression showed a significant relationship with cold ischemia time (r coefficient = 0.603), time to effective diuresis (r = 0.770), serum creatinine levels at biopsy (r = 0.649), and degree of ATN (r = 0.810) (p = 0.001, Pearson test). In the murine IR model, western blot showed an increase in PARP-1 that was blocked by Parp-1 inhibitor. Immunohistochemical study of PARP-1 in kidney allograft biopsies would allow early detection of possible delayed renal function, and the administration of PARP-1 inhibitors may offer a therapeutic option to reduce damage from IR in donor kidneys by preventing or minimizing ATN. In summary, these results suggest a pivotal role for PARP-1 in the ATN of renal transplantation. We propose the immunohistochemical assessment of PARP-1 in kidney allograft biopsies for early detection of a possible delayed renal function."
https://openalex.org/W1969970496,"Background Reciprocal interactions between glial cells and olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) cause ORN axons entering the brain to sort, to fasciculate into bundles destined for specific glomeruli, and to form stable protoglomeruli in the developing olfactory system of an experimentally advantageous animal species, the moth Manduca sexta. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and the cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) neuroglian and fasciclin II are known to be important players in these processes. Methodology/Principal Findings We report in situ and cell-culture studies that suggest a role for glycosphingolipid-rich membrane subdomains in neuron-glia interactions. Disruption of these subdomains by the use of methyl-β-cyclodextrin results in loss of EGFR activation, depletion of fasciclin II in ORN axons, and loss of neuroglian stabilization in the membrane. At the cellular level, disruption leads to aberrant ORN axon trajectories, small antennal lobes, abnormal arrays of olfactory glomerul, and loss of normal glial cell migration. Conclusions/Significance We propose that glycosphingolipid-rich membrane subdomains (possible membrane rafts or platforms) are essential for IgCAM-mediated EGFR activation and for anchoring of neuroglian to the cytoskeleton, both required for normal extension and sorting of ORN axons."

https://openalex.org/W2041951873,"Gabaculine is a potent inhibitor of the vitamin B6-dependent key enzyme in chlorophyll biosynthesis, glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminomutase (GSAM). The inhibition effect is caused by an enzymatic deprotonation of the neurotoxin and requires the aldimine (PLP) form of the cofactor at the active site. In this study, we show that a single-point mutation confers resistance to gabaculine. A combined functional and structural analysis of wild-type GSAM in complex with gabaculine and the GSAM(M248I) form allowed us to decipher in atomic detail the molecular basis of this unique resistance. Interestingly, the gabaculine tolerance is caused by the absence of an essential water molecule that has a dual functional role. It serves as a nucleophilic shuttle for the hydroxyl anion along the reaction pathway and holds active-site Lys273 in a catalytically competent conformation. The single-point mutant is not able to fix this catalytic water between the beta-branched side chain of Ile248 and Lys273. As a consequence, the mutant enzyme is trapped in a gabaculine-insensitive but still enzymatically active amine (PMP) form."
https://openalex.org/W1972534644,"Background RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful tool for the targeted knockout of genes for functional genomics, system biology studies and drug discovery applications. To meet the requirements for high throughput screening in plants we have developed a new method for the rapid assembly of inverted repeat-containing constructs for the in vivo production of dsRNAs. Methodology/Principal Findings The procedure that we describe is based on tagging the sense and antisense fragments with unique single-stranded (ss) tails which are then assembled in a single tube Ligase Independent Cloning (LIC) reaction. Since the assembly reaction is based on the annealing of unique complementary single stranded tails which can only assemble in one orientation, greater than ninety percent of the resultant clones contain the desired insert. Conclusion/Significance Our single-tube reaction provides a highly efficient method for the assembly of inverted repeat constructs for gene suppression applications. The single tube assembly is directional, highly efficient and readily adapted for high throughput applications."

https://openalex.org/W2045593831,"Large cities can contain populations that move rapidly from one section to another in an efficient transportation network. An emerging air-borne or contact based pathogen could use these transportation routes to rapidly spread an infection throughout an entire population in a short time. Further, in many developed countries, the aging population is increasing. The family structure in these societies may also affect the course of a disease. To help understand the impact of an epidemic on family structure in a networked population, an individual based computer model that randomly generates networked cities with a specified range of population and disease characteristics and individual schedules, infectivity, transmission and hygiene factors was developed. Several salient issues emerged. First, a city of highly active individuals may in fact diminish the number of fatalities because the average duration of the interactions between agents is reduced. Second, home schooling can significantly improve survival because the institutional clustering of weak individuals is minimized. Third, the worst scenario for an aging population is the nuclear family where the aged population is confined to large housing facilities. Naturally, hygiene is the first barrier to infection. The results suggest that societies where extended families and small groups manage most of their own affairs may also be the most suitable for defense against a pandemic. This may prove applicable in city planning and policy making."
