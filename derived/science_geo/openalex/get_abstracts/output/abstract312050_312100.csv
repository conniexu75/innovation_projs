https://openalex.org/W2080042007,"Corn leaf aphids, European corn borers, and southern corn leaf blight were more abundant on corn exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide than they were on unexposed corn. Protein levels were higher in corn plants that were exposed to several dosages of 2,4-D, and this may have favored the growth of pests."
https://openalex.org/W2074578118,"New data on intensity-dependent lifetimes indicate that all previous in vivo fluorescence studies of chlorophyll by picosecond techniquies must be reinterpreted. Anomalously short lifetimes result from high-intensity effects due to exciton-excition annihilation processes. Measurements in Chlorella pyrenoidosa with single-pulse, low-intensity excitation indicate a longer ""true"" lifetime of 650 +/- 150 picoseconds."

Penicillin in the dosage used seems to have a good effect on vaginal infections. In nonpregnant women, during the ovulation phase, considered as including days 14 +/- 2 in the ordinary menstrual cycle of about 28 days, absorption seemed to be somewhat diminished. Higher levels were found in patients who were near the end of their menstrual cycles and in two patients who were menopausal. Patients who were very near term absorbed little or no penicillin, whereas patients 10 days post partum showed excellent absorption."

https://openalex.org/W2027852359,"The various radiative, convective, and conductive components of the net heat transfer are calculated and illustrated for various infrared transparencies of covers such as would be used in architectural, greenhouse, or solar collector windows. It is shown that in the limiting cases of infrared opacity and infrared transparency the relative contributions of the three modes of heat transfer are altered, but all contribute significantly. The radiation shielding arguments pertain to the analogous green-house effect in the atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2094791676,"The inactivation of penicillin K is more rapid in the renal-ligated rabbit than in the renal-ligated, eviscerate preparation. Inactivation of penicillin K occurs in the presence of surviving liver and kidney slices. Small amounts of penicillin G were inactivated by liver slices; larger amounts disappeared in the presence of kidney slices. The inactivation of penicillin K in the presence of rabbit liver and kidney slices is demonstrable anaerobically as well as aerobically."

https://openalex.org/W2073366981,"Synthesized benzene and simple alkylated derivatives are proposed as nonpetrochemical gasoline components. Feasible raw materials include coal, coke, charcoal, and carbonaceous wastes. The basic synthesis consists of the formation of lithium carbide by reaction of the metal with carbon, hydrolysis of the carbide to acetylene, cyclization of acetylene to benzene, and regeneration of lithium metal. Total synthesis benzene is substantially different from other synthetic hydrocarbon fuels in that its hydrogen content is obtained from water so that hydrogen gas is not needed as a major reactant."

https://openalex.org/W2019095831,"The cascading, travertine-depositing part of Wilson Falls Creek is supersaturated with respect to $CaCO_{3}$ throughout the year, owing to the supersaturation of the feeder springs. The creek loses $CaCO_{3}$ when its temperature is above 8Â° C. The losses increase with rising temperature, but at all times adjustment is very slow. The rate of adjustment is accelerated by rising temperature, aeration, and close contact of the water with calcite."
