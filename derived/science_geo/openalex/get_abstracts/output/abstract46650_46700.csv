https://openalex.org/W1977025966,"We have used in situ hybridization and computer-aided reconstruction to study the spatial distribution of expression of the mammary tumor proto-oncogene int-1 during mouse embryogenesis. int-1 RNA accumulation is restricted to specific regions of the neural plate and its derivatives between 9 and 14.5 days of development. int-1 RNA accumulates throughout the neural plate at the anterior head folds of the 9 day embryo but only at its lateral tips in more posterior regions. Following neural tube closure, int-1 expression is restricted to specific regions of the dorsal wall of the brain ventricles and spinal cord, the ventral wall of the midbrain and the diencephalon, and the lateral walls of the neuroepithelium at the midbrain-hindbrain junction. These data suggest that int-1 has a role in the early stages of central nervous system development in the mouse embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2042027043,"Tripeptides containing the acceptor sequence for Asn-linked glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) were added to CHO and HepG2 cells. The tripeptides were glycosylated in the ER and then secreted into the medium, via the Golgi complex in which the oligosaccharide chains were processed. The half-time for secretion, ∼10 min, was faster than that of known proteins transported through the same pathway. Since much evidence suggests that oligosaccharide chains are not signals for transport, it appears that no signal is necessary for rapid and efficient transport from the ER to the Golgi, or from the Golgi to the cell surface. Rather, it appears that proteins retained as permanent residents en route through the ER-Golgi transport pathway must contain specific retention signals."
https://openalex.org/W1557671402,"Exposure of red blood cells to oxygen radicals can induce hemoglobin damage and stimulate protein degradation, lipid peroxidation, and hemolysis. To determine if these events are linked, rabbit erythrocytes were incubated at 37 degrees C with various oxygen radical-generating systems and antioxidants. Protein degradation, measured by the production of free alanine, increased more than 11-fold in response to xanthine (X) + xanthine oxidase (XO). A similar increase in proteolysis occurred when the cells were incubated with acetaldehyde plus XO, with ascorbic acid plus iron (Asc + Fe), or with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) alone. Upon addition of XO, increased proteolysis was evident within 5 min and was linear for up to 5 h. In contrast, lipid peroxidation, as shown by the production of malonyldialdehyde, conjugated dienes, or lipid hydroperoxides was observed only after 2 h of incubation with X + XO, acetaldehyde + XO, or H2O2. Ascorbate plus Fe2+ induced both protein degradation and lipid peroxidation; however, the addition of various antioxidants (urate, xanthine, glucose, or butylated hydroxytoluene) decreased lipid peroxidation without affecting proteolysis. Thus, these processes seem to occur by distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, at low concentrations of XO, protein degradation was clearly increased in the absence of detectable lipid peroxidation products. Hemolysis occurred only in a small number of cells (9%) and followed the appearance of lipid peroxidation products. Thus, an important response of red cells to oxygen radicals is rapid degradation of damaged cell proteins. Increased proteolysis seems to occur independently of membrane damage and to be a more sensitive indicator of cell exposure to oxygen radicals than is lipid peroxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2057359558,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a heritable disease involving deficient expression of three related leukocyte adhesion glycoproteins: LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95. These proteins are alpha beta heterodimers containing identical 95,000 dalton beta subunits. Here we demonstrate that the primary defect in LAD is in the beta subunit gene. We identified five distinct beta subunit phenotypes in LAD patients: undetectable beta subunit mRNA and protein precursor; low levels of beta subunit mRNA and precursor; an aberrantly large beta subunit precursor, probably due to an extra glycosylation site; an aberrantly small precursor; and a grossly normal precursor. Mutant beta subunit precursors from LAD patients failed to associate with the LFA-1 alpha subunit. In family studies, inheritance of the aberrant precursors correlates with the known inheritance of the LAD defect."
https://openalex.org/W2078383532,"Crystallins, the principal components of the lens, have been regarded simply as soluble, structural proteins. It now appears that the major taxon-specific crystallins of vertebrates and invertebrates are either enzymes or closely related to enzymes. In terms of sequence similarity, size, and other physical characteristics delta-crystallin is closely related to argininosuccinate lyase, tau-crystallin to enolase, and SIII-crystallin to glutathione S-transferase; moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that epsilon-crystallin is an active lactate dehydrogenase. Enzymes may have been recruited several times as lens proteins, perhaps because of the developmental history of the tissue or simply because of evolutionary pragmatism (the selection of existing stable structures for a new structural role)."
https://openalex.org/W2088735794,"Virusoids are circular single-stranded RNAs dependent on plant viruses for replication and encapsidation. Recently, we showed that an in vitro-synthesized RNA containing 273 nucleotides of the 324-nucleotide virusoid of lucerne transient streak virus self-cleaves at a unique site. The reaction requires heating and snap cooling of the RNA and the subsequent addition of magnesium ions. Here, we test the 55-nucleotide, hammerhead-shaped, structural model proposed for the active site by preparing RNAs with both 5' and 3' terminal deletions. Results indicate that the hammerhead structure is sufficient and necessary for self-cleavage, that certain sequences prevent the formation of the hammerhead structure in the native virusoid RNA, and that an RNA molecule containing only 52 nucleotides is capable of an RNA-mediated reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1535086203,"We have suggested that red blood cell proteolytic systems can degrade oxidatively damaged proteins, and that both damage and degradation are independent of lipid peroxidation (Davies, K. J. A., and Goldberg, A. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8220-8226. These ideas have now been tested in cell-free extracts of rabbit erythrocytes and reticulocytes. Exposure to oxygen radicals or H2O2 increases the degradation of endogenous proteins in cell-free extracts, as in intact cells. Various radical-generating systems (acetaldehyde or xanthine + xanthine oxidase, ascorbic acid + iron, H2O2 + iron) and H2O2 alone enhanced the rates of proteolysis severalfold. Since these extracts were free of membrane lipids, protein damage and degradation must be independent of lipid peroxidation. An antioxidant buffer consisting of HEPES, glycerol, and dithiothreitol inhibited the increased proteolysis by 60-100%. Mannitol caused a 50-80% reduction in proteolysis suggesting that the hydroxyl radical (.OH), or a species with similar reactivity, may be the initiator of protein damage. When casein or bovine serum albumin were exposed to .OH (generated by H2O2 + Fe2+, or COCo radiation) these proteins were degraded up to 50 times faster than untreated proteins during subsequent incubations with red cell extracts. Mannitol inhibited this increase in proteolysis only if present during .OH exposure; mannitol did not affect the degradative system. Although ATP increased the degradation of untreated proteins 4- to 6-fold in reticulocyte extracts, it had little or no effect on the degradation of proteins exposed to .OH. ATP also did not stimulate hydrolysis of .OH-treated proteins in erythrocyte extracts. Leupeptin did not affect the degradative processes in either extract; thus lysosomal or Ca2+-activated thiol proteases were not involved. We propose that red cells contain a soluble, ATP-independent proteolytic pathway which may protect against the accumulation of proteins damaged by .OH or other active oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W1971980406,"The growth hormone (GH) gene is specifically expressed in the anterior pituitary. The first 289 bp of the human (h)GH 5′ region contains a promoter that is active only in pituitary-derived cell lines. These cell lines also contain a specific factor, GHF-1, that binds to two sites upstream to the hGH TATA box. Using in vitro transcription systems we demonstrate greater hGH promoter activity in extracts of GH-expressing GC cells than in extracts of nonexpressing HeLa cells. The two GHF-1 binding sites are essential promoter elements in GC extracts. Addition of GHF-1-containing fractions to HeLa extracts stimulates hGH promoter activity. Thus, GHF-1 appears to be a positively acting, cell-type- and promoter-specific transcription factor. Furthermore, the tissue specificity of the hGH promoter appears to be positively controlled by the abundance or activity of GHF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2069816854,"The int-1 proto-oncogene is transcriptionally activated in mammary tumors by mouse mammary tumor virus insertion mutations and is normally expressed only in adult mouse testes and mid-gestational embryos. We have used anatomical dissection of embryos, germ-cell fractionation, peripuberal expression studies, and spermatogenesis mutants to identify more precisely the tissues and cells that contain int-1 RNA. In the testis, int-1 RNA is detected only in postmeiotic germ cells undergoing differentiation from round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. In embryos 11-15 days after conception, expression of the gene is restricted to the developing central nervous system in regions of the neural tube other than the telencephalon. Our findings suggest that int-1 mediates developmental events at these two sites."
https://openalex.org/W2019636553,"Selective transcription of human mitochondrial DNA requires a transcription factor (mtTF) in addition to an essentially nonselective RNA polymerase. Partially purified mtTF is able to sequester promoter-containing DNA in preinitiation complexes in the absence of mitochondrial RNA polymerase, suggesting a DNA-binding mechanism for factor activity. Functional domains, required for positive transcriptional regulation by mtTF, are identified within both major promoters of human mtDNA through transcription of mutant promoter templates in a reconstituted in vitro system. These domains are essentially coextensive with DNA sequences protected from nuclease digestion by mtTF-binding. Comparison of the sequences of the two mtTF-responsive elements reveals significant homology only when one sequence is inverted; the binding sites are in opposite orientations with respect to the predominant direction of transcription. Thus mtTF may function bidirectionally, requiring additional protein-DNA interactions to dictate transcriptional polarity. The mtTF-responsive elements are arrayed as direct repeats, separated by approximately 80 bp within the displacement-loop region of human mitochondrial DNA; this arrangement may reflect duplication of an ancestral bidirectional promoter, giving rise to separate, unidirectional promoters for each strand."
https://openalex.org/W2085322299,Computer simulations of the diffusion of a substrate to an enzyme active site were performed. They included the detailed shape of the protein and an accurate description of its electrostatic potential. Application of the method to the diffusion of the superoxide anion to the protein superoxide dismutase revealed that the electric field of the enzyme enhances the association rate of the anion by a factor of 30 or more. Calculated changes in the association rate as a function of ionic strength and amino acid modification paralleled the observed behavior. Design principles of superoxide dismutase are considered with respect to insights provided by the simulations. A possible means of enhancing the enzyme turnover rate through site-directed mutagenesis is proposed.
https://openalex.org/W1516427878,"The mechanism for the post-translational conversion of glutamine to pyroglutamic acid on the N terminus of newly synthesized peptides and proteins is unknown. An assay is reported that permits measurement of the rate of conversion of Gln-His-Pro-NH2 to pyroGlu-His-Pro-NH2 (TRH). Using this assay, we demonstrate that the spontaneous cyclization of the N-terminal glutamine of this peptide occurs only slowly under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we describe the presence in rat brain, porcine pituitary, and human B lymphocytes of an enzyme(s) which converts Gln-His-Pro-NH2 into pyroGlu-His-Pro-NH2. The enzyme(s) appears to be a glycoprotein, is maximally active at neutral pH, has a Mr of 55,000, and contains catalytically significant sulfhydryl groups. The product of the enzymatic reaction was confirmed by high resolution fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. In preliminary studies, we find that over 90% of the enzyme in bovine adrenal medulla is contained in the soluble chromaffin vesicle fraction. These findings indicate that in vivo the post-translational conversion of a glutaminyl-peptide into a pyroglutamyl-peptide is neither spontaneous nor abiotic as has been previously proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2134698924,"We have demonstrated by primer elongation and cap analysis that mature vaccinia virus late transcripts are discontinuously synthesized. We have shown that RNA transcripts from a translocated 11K and from the authentic 11K and 4b late promoters are extended by approximately 35 nucleotides beyond the start site determined by S1 mapping using vaccinia genomic DNA as a probe. Sequencing of the RNA and of the first strand cDNA reveal that a homopolymeric poly(A) sequence is linked to the 5' terminus of the RNA transcripts. S1 mapping of RNA transcripts with a DNA probe containing an A-stretch, replacing promoter sequences upstream of position -1, confirms the existence of a poly(A) leader of approximately 35 A-residues."
https://openalex.org/W2021816782,"The effect of electric current on protein biosynthesis in mammalian fibroblasts was investigated with neonatal bovine fibroblast-populated collagen matrices. The field strength dependence of electric field modulation of proline incorporation into extracellular and intracellular protein was measured over a frequency range from 0.1 to 1000 hertz. A frequency- and amplitude-dependent reduction in the rate of incorporation was observed. In tissues containing cells aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the electric field, this response was dependent on the orientation of the cells relative to the direction of the applied electric field. This study demonstrates that currents of physiological strength can stimulate alterations in biosynthesis and thereby may influence tissue growth, remodeling, and repair."
https://openalex.org/W1661742214,"To investigate the factors regulating the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains containing the repeating disaccharide [3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1] in animal cell glycoproteins, we have examined the structures and terminal sequences of these chains in the complex-type asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from the mouse lymphoma cell line BW5147. Cells were grown in medium containing [6-3H]galactose, and radiolabeled glycopeptides were prepared and fractionated by serial lectin affinity chromatography. The glycopeptides containing the poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains in these cells were complex-type tri- and tetraantennary asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. The poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains in these glycopeptides had four different terminal sequences with the structures: I, Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,3Gal-R; II, Gal alpha 1,3Gal beta 1,4GlcNac beta 1,3Gal-R; III, Sia alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,3Gal-R; and IV, Sia alpha 2,6Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,3Gal-R. We have found that immobilized tomato lectin interacts with high affinity with glycopeptides containing three or more linear units of the repeating disaccharide [3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1] and thereby allows for a separation of glycopeptides on the basis of the length of the chain. A high percentage of the long poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains bound by immobilized tomato lectin were not sialylated and contained the simple terminal sequence of Structure I. In addition, a high percentage of the sialic acid residues that were present in the long chains were linked alpha 2,3 to penultimate galactose residues (Structure III). In contrast, a high percentage of the shorter poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains not bound by the immobilized lectin were sialylated, and most of the sialic acid residues in these chains were linked alpha 2,6 to galactose (Structure IV). These results indicate that there is a relationship in these cells between poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain length and the degree and type of sialylation of these chains."

https://openalex.org/W2093689465,A basic amphiphilic alpha-helix is a structural feature common to many calmodulin-binding peptides and proteins. A set of fluorescent analogues of a very tight binding inhibitor (dissociation constant of 200 picomolar) of calmodulin has been synthesized. The fluorescent amino acid tryptophan has been systematically moved throughout the sequence of this peptide. The fluorescence properties for the peptides repeat every three to four residues and are consistent with the periodicity observed for an alpha-helix.
https://openalex.org/W1489262505,"The bioenergetic basis by which the Krebs cycle substrate pyruvate increased cardiac contractile function over that observed with the Embden-Meyerhof substrate glucose was investigated in the isovolumic guinea pig heart. Alterations in the content of the high energy phosphate metabolites and the rate of high energy phosphate turnover were measured by 31P NMR. These were correlated to the changes in contractile function and rates of myocardial oxygen consumption. Maximum left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and high energy phosphates were observed with 16 mM glucose or 10 mM pyruvate. In hearts perfused with 16 mM glucose, the intracellular phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration was 15.2 +/- 0.6 mM with a PCr/Pi ratio of 10.3 +/- 0.9. The O2 consumption was 5.35 mumol/g wet weight/min, and these hearts exhibited a LVDP of 97 +/- 3.7 mm Hg at a constant paced rate of 200 beats/min. In contrast, when hearts were switched to 10 mM pyruvate, the PCr concentration was 18.3 +/- 0.4 mM, the PCr/Pi ratio was 30.4 +/- 2.2, the O2 consumption was 6.67 mumol/g wet weight/min, and the LDVP increased to 125 +/- 3.3 mm Hg. From NMR saturation transfer experiments, the steady-state flux of ATP synthesis from PCr was 4.9 mumol/s/g of cell water during glucose perfusion and 6.67 mumol/s/g of cell water during pyruvate perfusion. The flux of ATP synthesis from ADP was measured to be 0.99 mumol/s/g of cell water with glucose and calculated to be 1.33 mumol/s/g of cell water with pyruvate. These results suggest that pyruvate quite favorably alters myocardial metabolism in concert with the increased contractile performance. Thus, as a mechanism to augment myocardial performance, pyruvate appears to be unique."
https://openalex.org/W1528682984,"Treatment of the soluble insulin receptor from human placenta with 1.25 mM dithiothreitol and 75 mM Tris at pH 8.5 results in complete reduction of interhalf disulfide bonds (class 1 disulfides) and dissociation of the tetrameric receptor into the dimeric alpha beta form. The alpha beta receptor halves exhibit a reduced affinity for insulin binding (Boni-Schnetzler, M., Rubin, J. B., and Pilch, P. F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15281-15287). Kinetic experiments reveal that reduction of class 1 disulfides is a faster process than the loss of affinity for ligand, indicating that events subsequent to reduction of interhalf disulfides are responsible for the affinity change. We show that a third class of alpha subunit intrachain disulfides is more susceptible to reduction at pH 7.6 than at pH 8.5 and appears to form part of the ligand binding domain. Reduction of the intrachain disulfide bonds in this part of the alpha subunit leads to a loss of insulin binding. Modification of this putative binding domain by dithiothreitol can be minimized if reduction is carried out at pH 8.5. When the insulin receptor in placental membranes is reduced at pH 8.5, the receptor's affinity for insulin is not changed when binding is measured in the membrane. However, the Kd for insulin binding is reduced 10-fold when alpha beta receptor halves are subsequently solubilized. Scatchard analysis of insulin binding to reduced or intact receptors in the membrane and in soluble form together with sucrose density gradient analysis of soluble receptors suggests that alpha beta receptor halves remain associated in the membrane after reduction, but they are dissociated upon solubilization. We interpret these results to mean that the association of two ligand binding domains, 2 alpha beta receptor halves, is required for the formation of an insulin receptor with high affinity for ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1974068903,"The influenza C virus (INF-C) hemagglutinin recognizes 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid. The same protein contains the receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE), which is a 9-O-acetyl-esterase. The RDE was inactivated by the serine esterase inhibitor di-isopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). [3H]DFP-labeling localized the active site to the heavy chain of the glycoprotein. DFP did not alter the hemagglutination or fusion properties of the protein, but markedly decreased infectivity of the virus, demonstrating that the RDE is important for primary infection. Finally, DFP-treated INF-C bound specifically and irreversibly to cells expressing 9-O-acetylated sialic acids. This provides a probe for a molecule that was hitherto very difficult to study."
https://openalex.org/W1563246915,"Normal human fibroblasts secrete a protein named protease nexin II (PN II) which previously was shown to form sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable complexes with epidermal growth factor-binding protein (EGF-BP). These complexes then bind to the same cells and are rapidly internalized and degraded (Knauer, D.J., and Cunningham, D.D. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2310-2314). Here we describe a procedure for purifying PN II to apparent homogeneity from serum-free culture medium conditioned by human fibroblasts. The first step employed dextran sulfate-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Further purification was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-400. Sequence analysis of purified PN II identified 33 amino-terminal amino acids; a computer search of several protein sequence data banks failed to reveal homologies with other reported amino acid sequences. Purified PN II had an apparent Mr of 106,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.2. It retained full activity after incubation in the presence of 0.05% SDS or at a pH of 1.5. PN II formed SDS-stable complexes with EGF-BP, the gamma subunit of 7 S nerve growth factor, and trypsin with estimated Mr of 120,000, 120,000, and 110,000, respectively. PN II was metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and purified; the metabolically labeled protein formed complexes with EGF-BP. Complexes between purified PN II and EGF-BP bound to human fibroblasts. These results show that the purified protein possesses the properties previously attributed to PN II in cell culture medium."

https://openalex.org/W47160147,"The distribution of calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) between cytosol and membrane fractions was examined in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells treated with angiotensin II or potassium. Protein kinase C was isolated from cytosol and from detergent-solubilized particulate fractions by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. A major peak of activity for both the soluble and particulate forms of adrenal glomerulosa protein kinase C was eluted at 0.05-0.09 M NaCl. The soluble and particulate forms were found to constitute about 95 and 5%, respectively, of the total enzyme activity in unstimulated cells. A second peak of kinase activity was eluted with 0.15-0.19 M NaCl, which was not dependent on the presence of phospholipids. Exposure of isolated cells for 20 min to 10(-8) M angiotensin II resulted in a decrease in cytosolic activity to 30-40% of control values, and in a corresponding increase in protein kinase C activity associated with the particulate fraction. This hormone-induced redistribution was found to be dose-dependent with an ED50 of 2 nM for angiotensin II, and it occurred rapidly, reaching a plateau within 5-10 min. It was prevented by the specific antagonist [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II. By contrast, stimulation with 12 mM KCl did not change the subcellular distribution of protein kinase C activity. These results suggest that redistribution of protein kinase C represents an early step in the post-receptor activation cascade following angiotensin II, but not potassium stimulation of adrenal glomerulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507803138,"An enzyme system capable of supporting accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II has been prepared from rat liver. Transcription depends upon at least three activities in addition to RNA polymerase II. One activity, designated alpha, has been purified 30,000-fold to near homogeneity. From all promoters tested, the synthesis of full-length runoff transcripts by RNA polymerase II depends upon alpha. alpha appears to consist of a single 35,000-dalton polypeptide and is inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide and heat. Similarities between alpha and transcription activities in fractions TFIIB (Matsui, T., Segall, J., Weil, P. A., and Roeder, R. G. (1980) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1507325186,"In this report, we describe our studies on the structures of the O-linked oligosaccharides in glycoproteins synthesized by the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. Adult male schistosomes were incubated with either [2-3H]mannose, [6-3H]glucosamine, or [6-3H]galactose to metabolically radiolabel newly synthesized glycoproteins. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorographic analyses indicated that many glycoproteins were labeled by each of the radioactive precursors. Glycopeptides were prepared from radiolabeled glycoproteins by pronase treatment and fractionated on columns of concanavalin A-Sepharose and pea lectin-agarose. The O-linked oligosaccharides were released from glycopeptides by treatment with mild base/borohydride. All O-linked material was found in glycopeptides not bound by either of the immobilized lectins. The structures of the released chains were then analyzed by a variety of techniques. Our results demonstrate that the schistosomes synthesize glycoproteins containing two major types of simple O-linked sugar chains. One type, which represents a minor fraction of the O-linked oligosaccharides, contains N-acetylgalactosamine linked to peptide. These O-linked chains occur as terminal O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine and the O-linked disaccharide, galactose----N-acetylgalactosamine. Sialic acid was not present in either of these O-linked chains or in any other glycopeptides derived from adult male schistosomes. However, the major type of O-linked chain in glycoproteins synthesized by adult schistosomes is an unusual terminal O-linked N-acetylglucosamine linked to peptide. This latter structure represents approximately 10% of the total radioactive N-acetylglucosamine recovered in all glycopeptides. Our results also suggest the possibility that the O-linked oligosaccharides are highly clustered on the glycopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1586997230,"Cytochrome P-450 was demonstrated to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of carboxylic acid esters to the corresponding carboxylic acids. 2,6-Dimethyl-4-phenyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and related dialkyl esters were shown to serve as substrates in NADPH-fortified rat liver microsomes and reconstituted systems containing purified cytochrome P-450 enzymes. The ethyl group gave rise to acetaldehyde. The reactions proceed with large kinetic deuterium isotope effects, consistent with the view that P-450 abstracts a hydrogen atom in the mechanism. Oxygen rebound to the radical site is then postulated to complete the reaction and lead to a hemiacetal-like structure which collapses to give the products. Rate studies with differing alkyl substituents showed that the reaction was more rapid with removal of an ethyl than a methyl or isopropyl group, consistent with the view that the ethyl optimizes steric and inductive effects. Oxidative cleavage of carboxylic acid esters has little biochemical precedent, due to the difficult character of the reaction, and should be considered as an alternative to direct hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W15748964,"Short chain acyl-CoA (SCA), medium chain acyl-CoA (MCA), and isovaleryl-CoA (IV) dehydrogenases were purified to homogeneity from human liver using ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by DEAE-Sephadex A-50, hydroxyapatite, Matrex Gel Blue A, agarose-hexane-CoA, and Bio-Gel A-0.5 column chromatographies. The specific activities of the final preparations were enriched 507-, 750-, and 588-fold over those from the second ammonium sulfate fractionation step. The native molecular weights were estimated to be 168,000, 178,000, and 172,000, respectively, by gel filtration. Each of them exhibited, on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single protein band with molecular weights of 41,000, 44,000, and 42,000, respectively, indicating a homotetrameric structure. UV/visual spectra, fluorescence spectra, and other evidence indicated that each contains 1 mol of FAD per subunit. They all utilized electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) or phenazine methosulfate (PMS) as an electron acceptor. The products of SCA dehydrogenase/butyryl-CoA, MCA dehydrogenase/octanoyl-CoA, and IV dehydrogenase/isovaleryl-CoA reactions were identified as crotonyl-CoA, 2-octenoyl-CoA, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, respectively, using gas chromatography. Kinetic parameters Vappmax and Kappm) of these enzymes for various acyl-CoA substrates, as well as Kappm values for ETF and PMS are presented. In general, the substrate specificities of human SCA, MCA, and IV dehydrogenases are slightly less stringent than those of their rat counterparts and resemble those of their bovine and porcine counterparts. The pattern of substrate specificity for these enzymes determined using ETF as electron acceptor significantly differed from that determined using PMS. All of them were severely inhibited by (methylenecyclopropyl)acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1493750520,"We have determined the complete primary structure for the carboxyl-terminal peptides of mouse alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) collagen; which have 229 and 227 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid sequences are 63% identical and conservatively substituted in 28 positions. A striking feature of these peptides is that the first half of each sequence is homologous with the second half, 37% in alpha 1(IV) and 36% in alpha 2(IV). These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal peptides of type IV collagen are closely related in their structure and evolution. Presumably, they were first derived by internal duplication of a common ancestral DNA sequence which later, by gene duplication, gave rise to the two different but homologous carboxyl-terminal peptides of type IV collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1543857411,"The secondary structure of a hydrophobic myelin protein (lipophilin), reconstituted with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine or dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, was investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Protein infrared spectra in the amide I region were analyzed quantitatively using resolution enhancement and band fitting procedures. Lipophilin in a phospholipid environment adopts a highly ordered secondary structure which at room temperature consists predominantly of alpha-helix (approximately 55%) and beta-type conformations (36%). The secondary structure of the protein is not affected by the lipid gel to liquid crystalline phase transition. Heating of the lipid-protein complex above approximately 35 degrees C results in a gradual decrease in alpha-helical content, accompanied by an increase in the amount of beta-structures. Lipophilin dissolved in 2-chloroethanol is, compared to the protein in a lipid environment, richer in the alpha-helical conformation but still contains a sizable amount of beta-structure."
https://openalex.org/W1592182146,"1,10-Phenanthroline inhibited the DNA-cellulose binding of the transformed calf uterus estrogen receptor (homodimer of 66-kDa molecules: 5 S estrogen receptor) in a temperature- and concentration-dependent manner. This result appears related to the metal-chelating property of 1,10-phenanthroline, since the inhibition was decreased by addition of Zn2+ and Cd2+, but not by Ca2+, Ba2+, or Mg2+ for which the affinity of the chelator is low. Only a slight inhibition was observed in the presence of the 1,7-phenanthroline, a nonchelating analogue. After dialysis or filtration to remove free 1,10-phenanthroline, DNA binding of the 5 S estrogen receptor was still inhibited. Conversely, the chelator was unable to release prebound 5 S estrogen receptor from DNA-cellulose. The 5 S estrogen receptor DNA binding was inhibited when 1,10-phenanthroline was present during the transformation to activated receptor of the hetero-oligomeric nontransformed 9 S estrogen receptor, in which the hormone binding subunits are associated with heat shock protein, Mr 90,000 (hsp 90) molecules. In contrast, if 1,10-phenanthroline was removed before the transformation took place, only a slight inhibition was observed. Other experiments with EDTA indicated a similar inhibition of DNA-cellulose binding by the 5 S estradiol receptor, and all metal ions chelated by this agent prevented its inhibitory effect. The results indicate that 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited the DNA binding of the transformed 5 S estradiol receptor by chelating metal ion tightly bound to the receptor, which is not accessible to the chelator when the receptor is bound to DNA or to hsp 90. Therefore, they suggest that the metal ion may play a critical role in the interaction with DNA and hsp 90 by maintaining the structural integrity of the implicated receptor domain."
https://openalex.org/W1542323359,"Kyotorphin (Tyr-Arg) is a unique neuropeptide which produces analgesia by releasing Met-enkephalin from slices of the brain and spinal cord. Recent studies revealed that possesses the properties of neurotransmitter/neuroregulator. In the present study, we identified a in the soluble fraction of rat brain synaptosomes (synaptosol) and characterized it. The enzyme partially purified with Sephacryl S-300 showed an absolute requirement for ATP, MgCl2, tyrosine, and arginine. The optimal pH was 7.5-9.0 and the pI was determined to be 6.1-6.2 by isoelectric focusing. The Km was 25.6 microM for tyrosine, 926 microM for arginine, 294 microM for ATP, and 442 microM for MgCl2. The Vmax was 34.0 pmol/mg of protein/h. The apparent molecular size of this kyotorphin synthetase further purified by the DE52 column was 240,000-245,000 daltons, estimated using TSKgel G4000SW column chromatography. The enzyme reaction is represented by the following equation: Tyr + Arg + ATP + MgCl2 + synthetase----Tyr-Arg (kyotorphin) + AMP + PPi + MgCl2 + synthetase. The regional distribution and subcellular localization of the showed a close correlation to that of levels in the rat brain. The amounts of formed from amino acids by the in the dialyzed synaptosol was 3.0-4.0 times higher than that from precursor proteins by processing enzymes within the 30 min incubation."

https://openalex.org/W1534894968,"Cytochrome b561 from bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin granules has been purified by fast protein liquid chromatography chromatofocusing. The purified cytochrome was reconstituted into ascorbate-loaded phosphatidylcholine vesicles. With this reconstituted system transmembrane electron transfer for extravesicular soluble dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was demonstrated. In accordance with the model proposed by Njus et al. (Njus, D., Knoth, J., Cook, C., and Kelley, P. M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 27-30), catalytic amounts of a redox mediator were necessary to achieve electron transfer between cytochrome and soluble dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Our observations also showed that when membranous dopamine beta-hydroxylase was reconstituted on cytochrome containing vesicles, electron transfer occurred only in the presence of a redox mediator. Since cytochrome b561 has been found in secretory vesicles associated with peptidyl glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, electron transfer to this enzyme was also examined. Analogous to the results obtained for dopamine beta-hydroxylase, transmembrane electron transfer to peptidyl glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase appears to require a redox mediator between cytochrome and this monooxygenase. These observations indicate that purified cytochrome b561 is capable of providing a transmembrane supply of electrons for both monooxygenases. Since no direct protein to protein electron transfer occurs, the results support the hypothesis that the ascorbate/semidehydroascorbate redox pair serves as a mediator for these enzymes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1579529625,"Protein carboxyl methyltransferases from erythrocytes and brain appear to catalyze the esterification of L-isoaspartyl and/or D-aspartyl residues but not of normal L-aspartyl residues. In order to identify the origin of these unusual residues which occur in subpopulations of a variety of cellular proteins, we studied the in vitro methylation by the erythrocyte enzyme of glucagon, a peptide hormone of 29 amino acids containing 3 aspartyl residues and a single asparagine residue. Methylated glucagon was digested with either trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, or endoproteinase Arg C, and the labeled fragments were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified. In separate experiments, methyl acceptor sites were determined by digesting glucagon first with proteases and then assaying purified glucagon fragments for methyl acceptor activity. Using both approaches, we found that the major site of methylation, accounting for about 62% of the total, was at the position of Asp-9. Chemical analysis of fragments containing this residue indicated that this site represents an L-isoaspartyl residue. A second site of methylation, representing about 23% of the total, was detected at the position of Asn-28 and was also shown to represent an L-isoaspartyl residue. Methyl acceptor sites were not detected at the positions of Asp-15 or Asp-21. Preincubation of glucagon under basic conditions (0.1 M NH4OH, 3 h, 37 degrees C) increased methylation at the Asn-28 site by 4-8-fold while methylation at the Asp-9 site remained unchanged. These results suggest that methylation sites can originate from both aspartyl and asparaginyl residues and that these sites may be distinguished by the effect of base treatment."
https://openalex.org/W173673297,"Caldesmon is a widely distributed calmodulin- and actin-binding protein which occurs in different forms depending on the tissue or cell type under examination. On the basis of molecular weight, caldesmon species can be divided into two classes: caldesmon77 (Mr 70,000-80,000) and caldesmon150 (Mr 140,000-150,000). We have examined the phosphorylation of caldesmon77 by protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) in vitro and in intact platelets. Caldesmon77, purified from bovine liver, could be phosphorylated by purified rat brain protein kinase C to a level of approximately 1.0 mol of phosphate per mol of caldesmon77 monomer. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis reveals that caldesmon77 is phosphorylated at two major sites exclusively on serine residues. Following treatment of platelets with tumor-promoting phorbol ester, caldesmon77 phosphorylation was elevated 4-fold. Tryptic peptide mapping of phosphorylated platelet caldesmon77 demonstrates that phosphorylation is most significantly enhanced on two peptides which had migration patterns identical with those of the two major phosphopeptides of bovine liver caldesmon77 phosphorylated in vitro. The results of this study indicate that protein kinase C can phosphorylate caldesmon77 in vitro and in intact platelets, suggesting a role for protein kinase C in the regulation of caldesmon77 function or localization."
https://openalex.org/W1479731196,"Chemical cross-linking procedures have been employed to study possible interactions between components of the mitochondrial outer membrane and NH2-terminal signal sequences located in proteins destined for import into the organelle. A synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 1-27 of pre-ornithine carbamyltransferase (pOCT) was found to interact specifically with a mitochondrial polypeptide of apparent molecular size 30 kDa. Membrane fractionation and protease accessibility analyses indicated that the polypeptide, designated p30, is located in the outer membrane. Binding of the synthetic peptide to p30 was saturable and reversible; Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a dissociation constant of 2 X 10(-6) M and predicts that p30 constitutes 4-10% of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein. Mild trypsin digestion of the mitochondrial surface destroyed both the ability of p30 to cross-link to the signal peptide and the ability of the organelle to import pOCT. Neither parameter was affected, however, by pretreatment of mitochondria with 1 M KCl."
https://openalex.org/W2151556470,"Organophosphorous compounds, which are potent inhibitors of egasyn-esterase activity, caused a rapid dissociation of the high molecular weight egasyn-microsomal beta-glucuronidase complex when administered in vivo or when added in vitro to microsomal suspensions. The dissociation was relatively specific to phosphodiester inhibitors of the esterase active site. Also, the egasyn-esterase active site was inaccessible to substrates and to inhibitors when egasyn was complexed to beta-glucuronidase. Dissociation of the egasyn-microsomal beta-glucuronidase complex in vivo by organophosphorous compounds was followed by massive and rapid secretion of microsomal beta-glucuronidase, but not egasyn, into plasma. These experiments implicate the egasyn-esterase active site in attachment of microsomal beta-glucuronidase to egasyn by a novel mechanism that, in turn, compartmentalizes beta-glucuronidase within the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1515027058,"The miscibility of triolein and cholesteryl oleate with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine was studied at the argon-buffer interface. The surface phase behavior of the system was analogous to that for cholesteryl ester-phospholipid mixtures in that both monolayer and double layer surface phases were formed. By considering the bulk properties of cholesteryl oleatetriolein mixtures and the two-dimensional phase rule, the entire system could be described. Double layer properties suggest that it consists of mostly triolein and phospholipid in the layer adjacent to the aqueous phase. The monolayer phase shows the formation of complexes between the neutral lipids and the phospholipid with stoichiometries nearly identical with those reported for bilayers (Hamilton, J. A., Miller, K. W., and Small, D. M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12821-12826). A second complex with a 3:1 stoichiometry is formed between triolein and cholesteryl oleate independently of interactions with phospholipid. Upon interaction with phospholipid, the triolein-cholesteryl oleate complex loses proportionately more area than either lipid alone. Because the area of complexes with phospholipid is constant, overall neutral lipid miscibility in such complexes is enhanced by the cholesteryl oleate-triolein interaction. Thus, our data explain the apparently nonideal mixing of cholesteryl oleate, triolein, and phospholipid in monolayers and in bilayers."

(1976) Biochemistry 15, 3956-3963) and monosaccharides which interact with the Man/Fuc receptor (Stah, P.D., Rodman, J.S., Miller, M.J., and Schlesinger, P.H. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 1399-1403) stimulate lysosomal enzyme secretion in rabbit alveolar macrophages in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Man43-bovine serum albumin (BSA), L-Fuc30-BSA, and Man96-poly-D-lysine (Hoppe, C.A., and Lee, Y.C. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1723-1730) were potent stimulators of lysosomal enzyme secretion. Mannose, L-fucose (Fuc), N-acetylmannosamine and N-acetylglucosamine were also effective, but much higher concentrations (above 10 mM) were required to elicit the same effects as the corresponding neoglycoproteins. After a 1.5-h incubation of the cells with Man43-BSA in the presence of 10 mM EDTA, the stimulation of lysosomal enzyme secretion was reduced by 73%. These results indicate that the Man/L-Fuc receptor participates in the process of lysosomal enzyme secretion. Addition of cycloheximide did not affect the stimulation by Man43-BSA, indicating that shunting of newly synthesized enzymes is not involved in the observed phenomenon. The temporary binding of ligands to the cell surface Man/Fuc receptor at 4 degrees C also did not show the stimulation effect. Secretion of Man211-poly-D-lysine preloaded in secondary lysosome was stimulated by Man43-BSA, suggesting that secondary lysosome is one of the pools from which lysosomal enzymes are secreted. However, neither storage of an undegradable ligand in lysosomes nor the degradation of a degradable ligand was an absolute requirement for stimulation of enzyme secretion, because both Man96-poly-D-lysine (nondegradable ligand) and Man43-BSA (degradable ligand) can stimulate to a similar extent."
https://openalex.org/W1499169734,"Malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (EC 1.1.1.39) was purified to near homogeneity from both a C3 plant, Solanum tuberosum, and a CAM plant, Crassula argentea. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of both enzymes revealed an alpha,beta subunit composition with corresponding molecular mass assignments of 61,000 and 55,000 daltons. Isoelectric focusing under native conditions showed only one constituent malic enzyme form with an isoelectric point of 5.1. No evidence of additional isoenzymes was found. Urea isoelectric focusing showed the alpha subunit to be more acidic than the beta subunit. Peptide mapping by limited proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease, trypsin, and endoproteinase Arg-C eliminated the possibility that a precursor-product relationship may have existed between the two subunits and demonstrated that they each possess unique primary sequences. Further support for this conclusion was obtained when significant differences in the contents of glutamic acid, isoleucine, and arginine were revealed by amino acid analysis of the isolated subunits. There was no apparent activity associated with the separated subunits (as resolved by urea-DEAE chromatography), but activity could be found in a reconstituted system, thereby indicating an (alpha,beta)n protomeric configuration. This is the first case where malic enzyme has been conclusively shown to be constructed from nonidentical subunits. This phenomenon has been observed only for the NAD malic enzyme isolated from plants."
https://openalex.org/W1497245601,"In the presence of RecA single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is found to exhibit flow linear dichroism (LD). In the absence of the cofactor ATP gamma S, the LD is positive with a maximum at about 280 nm, whereas in the presence of the cofactor ATP gamma S there is still a positive long-wavelength band, but a negative LD contribution centered at 260 nm indicates an orientation of the DNA bases preferentially perpendicular to the fiber axis. For the complex between ssDNA and RecA without ATP gamma S, essentially all LD derives from the protein (tryptophane) subunits indicating a structure in which the tryptophanes are preferentially parallel to the fiber axis of the complex while the DNA bases remain essentially unoriented. The magnitude of the LD increases with the RecA/DNA ratio to a point corresponding to approximately three nucleotides per RecA and decreases thereafter with excess of DNA. This indicates that there are two modes of binding with different stoichiometries."
https://openalex.org/W1557346720,"Enzymes from Salvia officinalis, capable of catalyzing the electrophilic isomerization and subsequent cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate (3,8-dimethylocta-2E,6-dienyl pyrophosphate) to the monoterpenes (+)-alpha-pinene and (+)-bornyl pyrophosphate, were examined with a series of substrate analogs modified in carbon chain length and in the geometric and electronic character of the C2-C3 and C6-C7 olefinic domains. Inhibition studies with these monoterpene cyclases indicated that the pyrophosphate ester function was the principal determinant of substrate recognition and that the C2-C3 olefin was recognized largely on the basis of geometry, whereas the primary basis of interaction with the C6-C7 olefin was electronic. A related group of allylic pyrophosphates was tested for the ability to undergo enzyme-catalyzed ionization to afford olefinic and/or alcoholic products. From the relative reaction rates it was deduced that the alignment of the allylic pi-system with the C1-OP bond was essential for ionization of the substrate and that specific interaction with the distal C6-C7 isopropylidene function served not only to optimize orbital alignment but also to exclude water from the active site, and thus determine the partitioning of cationic intermediates into olefins or alcohols. From the combination of results, the interrelationships of substrate functional groups within the active site could be approximated and the topology of geranyl pyrophosphate binding to the cyclase thereby formulated."
https://openalex.org/W1561858855,"Abstract Brush borders of cells lining the proximal small intestine of neonatal rats express a receptor specific for the Fc portion of IgG that mediates transport of IgG from gut lumen to blood. We have investigated the interaction of subclasses of rat IgG with this receptor, extracted in Triton X-114 solution, using phase separation to separate receptor-immunoglobulin complexes from free immunoglobulin. Binding of immunoglobulin showed the same pH dependence as is found in vivo, being active at pH 6 and reversibly inhibited at pH 8. The numbers of binding sites for each IgG subclass were similar, but polyclonal IgG2a was bound with higher affinity (1.2 X 10(8) M-1) than monoclonal IgG1 or IgG2b (2-3 X 10(7) M-1). Radiolabeled monoclonal IgG2c did not show specific binding, apparently as a result of the iodination process. Competition studies showed cross-inhibition between all IgG subclasses. IgG2a being approximately 10-fold more effective at competing for receptor than other isotypes, in the order IgG2a much greater than IgG1 greater than IgG2b greater than or equal to IgG2c. These data suggest that a single receptor capable of binding all subclasses of IgG is active in the detergent extract. However, investigation of radiolabeled immunoglobulins that were bound to isolated gut cells before detergent extraction showed evidence for other types of interaction in vivo."

Processing at T2 is eliminated by mutations within the T2 box, a 7 nucleotide conserved element, GACTTGC, located 15 bp downstream of the 3′ ends. The same conserved box is also present at T3, a site 60 bp upstream of the gene promoter and that is part of a termination site. Surprisingly, mutations within the T3 box also eliminate processing at T2. To obtain proper T2 function, T3 can be at any distance but must be in the correct orientation upstream of a ribosomal gene promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1589349989,"Point mutations in the adenoviral VAI gene promoter were generated by in vitro mutagenesis with sodium bisulfite and were identified by three phenotypes: the disappearance of certain restriction endonuclease cleavage sites, altered rates of transcription in cell-free extracts, and altered mobility of the RNA product on denaturing acrylamide gels. 25 different point mutations were assayed for their effect on VAI transcription in HeLa S100 extracts. Mutations which change the transcriptional ability of the gene were localized in the internal control regions which are highly conserved among genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The magnitude of the change in transcription correlates with the degree of conservation in the consensus sequence at the site of the mutation. Most of the mutations either do not change the transcription rate or reduce transcription less than 6-fold. Two mutations severely reduce the amount of RNA produced, whereas three mutations increase the production of VAI RNA. A second site revertant that partially restores transcription to a mutant gene that produces no detectable VAI has also been isolated."

The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results indicated a subunit mass of 120 +/- 10 kDa, while the functional size data indicates that the enzyme operates both in de novo and maintenance modes as a dimer of molecular mass 220 +/- 15 kDa with no evidence of monomers in solution of ionic strength between 0.1 and 0.8 M NaCl. The 220-kDa activity carried out the transmethylation of both hemi- and unmethylated DNA substrates. There was no evidence for separate functional catalytic sites on each monomer subunit acting independently when engaged in methylation of hemimethylated or single-stranded DNA from the invariance of radiation inactivation target size with these substrates. The radiation inactivation target size was 230 +/- 15 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1499548060,"Photoactivable reagents have been useful for studying the structural aspects of membrane hydrophobic core. We have reported earlier (Anjaneyulu, P.S.R., and Lala, A. K. (1982) FEBS Lett. 146, 165-167) the use of diazofluorene as a probe for fluorescent photochemical labeling of hydrophobic core in artificial membranes. To quantitate and enhance the monitoring ability of this probe, we have synthesized 2-[3H]diazofluorene of high specific activity. This reagent rapidly partitions into phosphatidylcholine vesicles and selectively labels the fatty acyl chains of phosphatidylcholine. The insertion yield (13%) is not affected by the presence of scavengers like reduced glutathione. 2-[3H]Diazofluorene also readily partitions into erythrocyte membranes and on photolysis labels the membrane. The overall insertion was 48% with 9.7% in protein fraction and the rest in lipids. The distribution of radioactivity in labeled protein fraction was restricted to integral membrane proteins with Band 3 being the major protein labeled. There is little or no labeling associated with extrinsic proteins like spectrin. Further analysis of labeled Band 3 by treatment with chymotrypsin indicated that the labeling was restricted to the membrane spanning CH-17 and CH-35 fragments. No labeling of the cytoplasmic fragment of Band 3 could be observed. 2-[3H]Diazofluorene should prove useful for studying integral membrane proteins and their membrane-spanning regions."
https://openalex.org/W1586101006,"The in situ assembly states of the glucose transport carrier protein in the plasma membrane and in the intracellular (microsomal) storage pool of rat adipocytes were assessed by studying radiation-induced inactivation of the D-glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding activities. High energy radiation inactivated the glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding of each of these membrane preparations by reducing the total number of the binding sites without affecting the dissociation constant. The reduction in total number of binding sites was analyzed as a function of radiation dose based on target theory, from which a radiation-sensitive mass (target size) was calculated. When the plasma membranes of insulin-treated adipocytes were used, a target size of approximately 58,000 daltons was obtained. For adipocyte microsomal membranes, we obtained target sizes of approximately 112,000 and 109,000 daltons prior to and after insulin treatment, respectively. In the case of microsomal membranes, however, inactivation data showed anomalously low radiation sensitivities at low radiation doses, which may be interpreted as indicating the presence of a radiation-sensitive inhibitor. These results suggest that the adipocyte glucose transporter occurs as a monomer in the plasma membrane while existing in the intracellular reserve pool either as a homodimer or as a stoichiometric complex with a protein of an approximately equal size."
https://openalex.org/W1594457527,"Abstract The absorption spectrum of cobalt(II)-substituted Aeromonas aminopeptidase is markedly perturbed by the presence of equimolar concentrations of D-amino acid hydroxamates and acyl hydroxamates that have previously been shown to be powerful inhibitors of this enzyme (Wilkes, S. H., and Prescott, J. M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13517-13521). D-Valine hydroxamate produces the most distinctive perturbation, splitting the characteristic 527 nm absorption peak of the cobalt enzyme to form peaks at 564, 520, and 487 nm with molar extinction values of 126, 98, and 67 M-1 cm-1, respectively. A qualitatively similar perturbation, albeit with lower extinction values, results from the addition of D-leucine hydroxamate, whereas D-alanine hydroxamate perturbs the spectrum, but does not evoke the peak at 564 nm. In contrast, hydroxamates of L-valine and L-leucine in concentrations equi-molar to that of the enzyme produce only faint indications of change in the spectrum, but the hydroxamates of several other L-amino acids perturb the spectrum essentially independently of the identity of the side chain and in a qualitatively different manner from that of D-valine hydroxamate and D-leucine hydroxamate. At the high enzyme:substrate ratios used in the spectral experiments, L-leucine hydroxamate and L-valine hydroxamate proved to be rapidly hydrolyzed, hence their inability to perturb the spectrum of the cobalt-substituted enzyme during the time course of a spectral experiment. Values of kcat for L-amino acid hydroxamates, all of which are good reversible inhibitors of the hydrolysis of L-leucine-p-nitroanilide by Aeromonas aminopeptidase, were found to range from 0.01 min-1 to 5.6 min-1 for the native enzyme and from 0.27 min-1 to 108 min-1 for the cobalt-substituted enzyme; their km values toward the cobalt aminopeptidase range from 1.2 X 10(-7) M to 1.9 X 10(-5) M. The mutual exclusivity of binding for hydroxamate inhibitors and 1-butaneboronic acid, previously shown by kinetics (Baker, J. O., Wilkes, S. H., Bayliss, M. E., and Prescott, J. M. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 2098-2103), was reflected in the characteristic spectra produced by these two types of inhibitors."
