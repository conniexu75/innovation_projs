https://openalex.org/W2527987309,"While conventional pathogenic protists have been extensively studied, there is an underappreciated constitutive protist microbiota that is an integral part of the vertebrate microbiome. The impact of these species on the host and their potential contributions to mucosal immune homeostasis remain poorly studied. Here, we show that the protozoan Tritrichomonas musculis activates the host epithelial inflammasome to induce IL-18 release. Epithelial-derived IL-18 promotes dendritic cell-driven Th1 and Th17 immunity and confers dramatic protection from mucosal bacterial infections. Along with its role as a ""protistic"" antibiotic, colonization with T. musculis exacerbates the development of T-cell-driven colitis and sporadic colorectal tumors. Our findings demonstrate a novel mutualistic host-protozoan interaction that increases mucosal host defenses at the cost of an increased risk of inflammatory disease."

Our work, therefore, identifies both calcium and CUL3 co-adaptors as important regulators of ubiquitylation events that control human development. Metazoan development depends on carefully executed gene expression programs that instruct pluripotent stem cells to adopt specific fates at defined times and locations within the growing organism. A failure to establish the correct sequence of differentiation events—as caused by mutations in transcription factors, loss of epigenetic regulators, or exposure to environmental toxins—can result in severe birth defects. This is illustrated by the neural crest, a collection of multipotent cells that emerge at the boundary of the neural plate and non-neural ectoderm and differentiate into various cell types, such as chondrocytes, melanocytes, or glia (Betancur et al., 2010Betancur P. Bronner-Fraser M. Sauka-Spengler T. Assembling neural crest regulatory circuits into a gene regulatory network.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 581-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes required for neural crest specification account for more than 500 congenital diseases, and aberrant neural crest maintenance can lead to cancer, such as neuroblastoma or melanoma. Early during development, neural crest cells migrate into the embryonic territory that is destined to become the craniofacial skeleton. These cranial neural crest cells differentiate into chondrocytes, which secrete an extracellular matrix largely composed of type II and type X collagen fibers (Karsenty et al., 2009Karsenty G. Kronenberg H.M. Settembre C. Genetic control of bone formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 629-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). During the final stages of endochondral bone formation, chondrocytes are replaced by osteoblasts that produce type I collagen (Alford et al., 2015Alford A.I. Kozloff K.M. Hankenson K.D. Extracellular matrix networks in bone remodeling.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2015; 65: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The collagen network secreted by chondrocytes and osteoblasts provides a blueprint for the deposition of calcium-phosphate crystals that endow bones with the rigidity demanded of a major structural element of metazoan bodies (Karsenty et al., 2009Karsenty G. Kronenberg H.M. Settembre C. Genetic control of bone formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 629-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). As expected from the role of collagen during bone formation, problems with neural crest specification, chondrocyte differentiation, or collagen secretion all result in aberrant craniofacial development (Twigg and Wilkie, 2015Twigg S.R. Wilkie A.O. New insights into craniofacial malformations.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: R50-R59Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We recently identified the ubiquitin ligase CUL3 as a major determinant of neural crest specification and collagen secretion (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, Werner et al., 2015Werner A. Iwasaki S.

Cell-fate determination by ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translation.Nature. 2015; 525: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CUL3 accomplishes these tasks by cooperating with distinct BTB-domain-containing substrate adaptors. When paired with KBTBD8, CUL3 monoubiquitylates the nucleolar proteins TCOF1 and NOLC1, which establishes a ribosome biogenesis platform, and CUL3KBTBD8-dependent changes in ribosome output promote neural crest specification and chondrocyte differentiation (Werner et al., 2015Werner A. Iwasaki S. McGourty C.A. Medina-Ruiz S. Teerikorpi N. Fedrigo I. Ingolia N.T. Rape M. Cell-fate determination by ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translation.Nature. 2015; 525: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mutations in TCOF1 result in the craniofacial disease Treacher Collins Syndrome (Dixon and Dixon, 2004Dixon J. Dixon M.J. Genetic background has a major effect on the penetrance and severity of craniofacial defects in mice heterozygous for the gene encoding the nucleolar protein Treacle.Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Conversely, upon engaging its adaptor KLHL12, CUL3 monoubiquitylates the COPII coat protein SEC31 and thereby drives formation of large COPII carriers that accelerate the traffic of collagen from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SEC31 interactor SEC23A prevent collagen secretion during craniofacial chondrogenesis and cause cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (Lang et al., 2006Lang M.R. Lapierre L.A. Frotscher M. Goldenring J.R. Knapik E.W. Secretory COPII coat component Sec23a is essential for craniofacial chondrocyte maturation.Nat.

Underscoring their function in a shared pathway, expression of KBTBD8 and KLHL12 is co-regulated in human melanoma cells exposed to a small molecule disruptor of neural crest specification (White et al., 2011White R.M.

Kaufman C. et al.DHODH modulates transcriptional elongation in the neural crest and melanoma.Nature. 2011; 471: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in craniofacial development, aberrant regulation of CUL3 has been associated with autism, schizophrenia, myopathy, and hypertension (De Rubeis et al., 2014De Rubeis S. He X.

Genet. 2013; 93: 6-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). CUL3 therefore acts at multiple stages of human development and activation of specific CUL3-adaptor complexes needs to be under tight control. This is illustrated by CUL3KLHL12: as collagen is produced in the ER and packaged into vesicles that bud from the ER membrane (Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015Malhotra V. Erlmann P. The pathway of collagen secretion.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 31: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), CUL3KLHL12 has to modify its substrate SEC31 at ER exit sites, but not in the cytoplasm. The localized activation of CUL3KLHL12 at the cytosolic face of the ER should be coordinated with the sorting of collagen into budding vesicles, an event that occurs within the ER lumen. Moreover, these reactions have to occur at the right developmental time, as premature or delayed collagen secretion result in fibrosis, fragile bones, or organismal aging (Ewald et al., 2015Ewald C.Y. Landis J.N. Porter Abate J. Murphy C.T. Blackwell T.K.

Invest. 2015; 125: 4483-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similar to CUL3KLHL12, CUL3-complexes that operate in mitosis, autophagy, or endocytosis should be activated in a temporally and spatially controlled manner (Genschik et al., 2013Genschik P. Sumara I. Lechner E. The emerging family of CULLIN3-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL3s): cellular functions and disease implications.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 2307-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, although previous studies had pointed to regulated adaptor transcription or degradation as systemic and often slow-acting means of CUL3 inhibition (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, Werner et al., 2015Werner A. Iwasaki S. McGourty C.A.

Yao X. Zhang Q. Stability of HIB-Cul3 E3 ligase adaptor HIB Is Regulated by Self-degradation and Availability of Its Substrates.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 12709Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), mechanisms that allow for rapid activation of distinct CUL3 complexes remain to be discovered. How CUL3KLHL12 is integrated into the series of events guiding craniofacial bone formation is therefore not known. Here, we show that the activity of CUL3KLHL12 toward SEC31 depends on two calcium-binding proteins, PEF1 and ALG2. PEF1 and ALG2 form a target-specific co-adaptor that allows CUL3KLHL12 to translate a transient rise in cytosolic calcium concentrations into more persistent SEC31 ubiquitylation, which drives COPII coat formation and collagen secretion. As calcium signals also instruct chondrocyte differentiation and collagen synthesis (Lin et al., 2014Lin S.S. Tzeng B.H. Lee K.R. Smith R.J. Campbell K.P. Chen C.C. Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel is required for the NFAT-dependent Sox9 expression in tracheal cartilage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E1990-E1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Tomita et al., 2002Tomita M. Reinhold M.I. Molkentin J.D. Naski M.C. Calcineurin and NFAT4 induce chondrogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42214-42218Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), calcium-dependent regulation of CUL3KLHL12 helps integrate collagen secretion into developmental programs of bone formation. We conclude that target-specific co-adaptors endow metazoan organisms with the ability to precisely tune the activity of distinct CUL3 complexes in response to developmental signals, including a rise in cytosolic calcium concentrations. To discover mechanisms of CUL3 regulation, we focused on CUL3KLHL12, which ubiquitylates SEC31 and promotes COPII coat formation and collagen secretion (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that regulators of CUL3KLHL12 might associate with KLHL12, SEC31, or both. To isolate such proteins, we affinity-purified KLHL12 from human embryonic kidney cells and used mass spectrometry to compare its interaction profile to ∼150 immunoprecipitations (IPs) that used the same epitope tag, cell line, or purification procedure (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). Confirming earlier observations (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), these experiments found KLHL12 to efficiently bind CUL3 and SEC31. In addition, KLHL12 associated with PEF1 and ALG2, two penta-EF-hand proteins that had been reported to interact with SEC31 (Yamasaki et al., 2006Yamasaki A. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. Komada M.

Involvement of the penta-EF-hand protein Pef1p in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of COPII subunit assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e40765Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); Lunapark, which stabilizes three-way junctions in the ER (Chen et al., 2015Chen S. Desai T. McNew J.A. Gerard P. Novick P.J. Ferro-Novick S. Lunapark stabilizes nascent three-way junctions in the endoplasmic reticulum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); the BTB-domain containing CUL3 adaptor KLHL26; the ubiquitin ligase RNF219; and the KELCH-domain-directed HSP90 adaptor NUDCD3 (Taipale et al., 2014Taipale M.

Of these KLHL12 interactors, only PEF1 and ALG2, but not Lunapark, NUDCD3, or RNF219, were also identified in affinity purifications of SEC31 (Figures 1A and S1A).Figure S1Interaction Network of the CUL3KLHL12 Ubiquitin Ligase, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) High-confidence interactors of KLHL12, SEC31, PEF1, and ALG2 were determined by affinity purification coupled to CompPASS mass spectrometry.

(B) Representative KLHL12 interactors detected in five independent KLHL12FLAG affinity purifications. The blue bar denotes the method of KLHL12 expression. Proteomic dissection of PEF1 and ALG2 interaction networks confirmed the association of each protein with KLHL12 and CUL3 (Figures 1A and S1A). Accordingly, both epitope-tagged and endogenous PEF1 and ALG2 precipitated with KLHL12FLAG, as determined by immunoblot analysis (Figures 1B and 1C). These interactions also occurred at the endogenous level, and affinity purification of SEC31 revealed its binding to PEF1, ALG2, and KLHL12 (Figure 1D). Notably, the reciprocal IP of endogenous ALG2 co-depleted KLHL12 from cell lysates, which suggests that most of KLHL12 exists in complexes with ALG2 (Figure 1E). We had previously shown that KLHL12 binds its substrate SEC31 with sufficient stability to result in co-localization of CUL3KLHL12 and SEC31 on large COPII coats (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). By performing sequential affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry or immunoblotting, we found that PEF1 and ALG2 remained associated with KLHL12-SEC31 complexes (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1A). Accordingly, PEF1 and ALG2, but not the alternative binding partner Lunapark, co-localized with KLHL12 and SEC31 on large COPII coats (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A), which frequently marked compartments that contained collagen (Figure 2E). Together, these results identify PEF1 and ALG2 as components of the CUL3KLHL12 machinery and suggest that these proteins could be involved in COPII vesicle size control and collagen secretion.Figure S2PEF1 and ALG2 Are Required for Substrate Binding by CUL3KLHL12, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Lunapark does not co-localize with KLHL12 on large COPII coats.

(D) Expression control for KLHL12FLAG-levels in cells transfected with either control siRNAs or siRNAs targeting PEF1 or ALG2. Protein levels were monitored by western blotting. To determine whether PEF1 and ALG2 regulate CUL3KLHL12, we depleted each protein using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and tested for consequences on substrate recognition by CUL3KLHL12. As often seen with interacting proteins, depletion of PEF1 reduced ALG2 levels and vice versa (Figure 3A). In addition, loss of PEF1 or ALG2 prevented the binding of KLHL12 or CUL3 to endogenous SEC31 (Figure 3A), which, as shown for ALG2, could be rescued by expressing a siRNA-resistant protein (see below). In a similar manner, the depletion of PEF1 or ALG2 abrogated the interaction between stably expressed KLHL12 and SEC31 without affecting the binding of KLHL12 to CUL3 (Figure S2B). Confirming the on-target effects of our siRNAs, the interaction between SEC31 and KLHL12 was also lost upon inactivation of the PEF1 or ALG2 genes using CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 3B). We conclude that PEF1 and ALG2 are required in cells for the stable binding of CUL3KLHL12 to its substrate, SEC31. To determine whether PEF1 and ALG2 were needed for the ubiquitylation of SEC31, we expressed His-tagged ubiquitin in a cell line that allowed for inducible expression of KLHL12. We purified conjugates under denaturing conditions and then tested for ubiquitylation of endogenous SEC31 by immunoblotting. Consistent with findings using overexpressed proteins (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), induction of KLHL12 resulted in the monoubiquitylation of endogenous SEC31 (Figure 3C). CUL3KLHL12 also catalyzed formation of some higher-molecular-weight conjugates, which likely represent SEC31 molecules ubiquitylated on multiple lysine residues (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In contrast, if these experiments were performed in the absence of PEF1 or ALG2, CUL3KLHL12-dependent SEC31 ubiquitylation was not observed (Figure 3C). As monoubiquitylation by CUL3KLHL12 regulates COPII coat formation (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we next depleted PEF1 or ALG2 from 293T cells and asked whether this treatment affected the size of COPII coats. Similar to what we had observed by confocal or electron microscopy (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), induction of KLHL12 in control cells resulted in large COPII structures that were marked by SEC31 and KLHL12 (Figures 3D, 3E, S2C, and S2D). By contrast, if cells were devoid of PEF1 or ALG2, KLHL12 did not co-localize with SEC31 and large COPII coats were not formed (Figures 3D, 3E, and S2B). The depletion of a separate KLHL12 binding partner, Lunapark, did not affect the size of COPII coats (Figure S2C), which underscores the specific requirement for PEF1 and ALG2 in these reactions. Based on the role of large COPII vesicles in collagen transport, we finally asked whether loss of PEF1 and ALG2 affected the ER-exit of newly synthesized collagen. We first exposed human osteosarcoma cells to a heat pulse, which results in retention of pro-collagen-I in the ER, and then we shifted these cells to lower temperatures to trigger a synchronous wave of collagen export (Venditti et al., 2012Venditti R. Scanu T. Santoro M. Di Tullio G. Spaar A. Gaibisso R. Beznoussenko G.V. Mironov A.A. Mironov Jr., A. Zelante L. et al.Sedlin controls the ER export of procollagen by regulating the Sar1 cycle.Science. 2012; 337: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells treated with control siRNAs rapidly transported collagen-I from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Figure 3F). By contrast, the loss of PEF1 or ALG2 resulted in a profound delay of collagen-I arrival at the Golgi, with many cells displaying persistent collagen ER staining throughout the time course of this experiment (Figure 3F). To investigate whether the delay in ER exit impaired collagen secretion from cells, we made use of HT1080 fibroblasts that constitutively express collagen-I, yet secrete it so efficiently that only minor collagen-I levels are detected in cell lysates (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As expected from our other experiments, depletion of PEF1 or ALG2 from these cells led to a strong cellular retention of collagen (Figure 3G). Thus, PEF1 and ALG2 are required for CUL3KLHL12 to engage SEC31, mediate SEC31 ubiquitylation, and trigger an increase in the size of COPII coats that drives collagen secretion. From these results, we infer that PEF1 and ALG2 are essential components of the CUL3KLHL12 machinery that controls COPII vesicle size. As a first step toward understanding the biochemical role of PEF1 and ALG2, we determined how these proteins engage CUL3KLHL12 or its substrate SEC31. While analyzing the modification of SEC31, we noticed that CUL3KLHL12 promoted the ubiquitylation of PEF1 (Figure 3C), which occurred on Lys residues in its EF-hand domain (Figure S3A). We did not observe ubiquitylation of PEF1 if cells expressed a CUL3-binding-deficient KLHL12 variant or if KLHL12 had been depleted by siRNAs (Figures S3B and S3C). As PEF1 was also modified by recombinant CUL3KLHL12 (Figure S3D), these experiments identified PEF1 as a substrate of CUL3KLHL12 and suggested that PEF1 might bind CUL3KLHL12 in a manner similar to SEC31. Indeed, the same mutations in KLHL12 that blocked SEC31 ubiquitylation (KLHL12FG289AA) (Jin et al., 2012Jin L. Pahuja K.B. Wickliffe K.E. Gorur A. Baumgärtel C. Schekman R. Rape M. Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of COPII coat size and function.Nature. 2012; 482: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) also prevented CUL3KLHL12 from binding to and ubiquitylating PEF1 (Figures 4A, 4B, S3E, and S3F). Moreover, increasing concentrations of PEF1 impaired SEC31 ubiquitylation by CUL3KLHL12 in vitro (Figure S3G) and reduced the interaction between SEC31 and KLHL12 in cells (Figure S3H). These findings indicated that PEF1 and SEC31 access an overlapping surface on the Kelch repeat of KLHL12.Figure 4PEF1 and ALG2 Form a Target-Specific CUL3KLHL12 Co-adaptorShow full caption(A) MBP, MBPKLHL12, or MBPKLHL12FG289AA were immobilized on beads and incubated with 35S-labeled PEF1.

https://openalex.org/W2528664164,"Background Recent research suggests that heat exposure may increase the risk of traumatic injuries. Published heat-related epidemiological studies have relied upon exposure data from individual weather stations. Objective To evaluate the association between heat exposure and traumatic injuries in outdoor agricultural workers exposed to ambient heat and internal heat generated by physical activity using modeled ambient exposure data. Methods A case-crossover study using time-stratified referent selection among 12,213 outdoor agricultural workers with new Washington State Fund workers’ compensation traumatic injury claims between 2000 and 2012 was conducted. Maximum daily Humidex exposures, derived from modeled meteorological data, were assigned to latitudes and longitudes of injury locations on injury and referent dates. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of injury for a priori daily maximum Humidex categories. Results The mean of within-stratum (injury day and corresponding referent days) standard deviations of daily maximum Humidex was 4.8. The traumatic injury odds ratio was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.22), 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.25), and 1.10 (95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.20) for daily maximum Humidex of 25–29, 30–33, and ≥34, respectively, compared to < 25, adjusted for self-reported duration of employment. Stronger associations were observed during cherry harvest duties in the June and July time period, compared to all duties over the entire study period. Conclusions Agricultural workers laboring in warm conditions are at risk for heat-related traumatic injuries. Combined heat-related illness and injury prevention efforts should be considered in high-risk populations exposed to warm ambient conditions in the setting of physical exertion."
https://openalex.org/W2529693955,"Rotating machinery is one of the most typical types of mechanical equipment and plays a significant role in industrial applications. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery has gained wide attention for its significance in preventing catastrophic accident and guaranteeing sufficient maintenance. With the development of science and technology, fault diagnosis methods based on multi-disciplines are becoming the focus in the field of fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. This paper presents a multi-discipline method based on image-processing for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Different from traditional analysis method in one-dimensional space, this study employs computing method in the field of image processing to realize automatic feature extraction and fault diagnosis in a two-dimensional space. The proposed method mainly includes the following steps. First, the vibration signal is transformed into a bi-spectrum contour map utilizing bi-spectrum technology, which provides a basis for the following image-based feature extraction. Then, an emerging approach in the field of image processing for feature extraction, speeded-up robust features, is employed to automatically exact fault features from the transformed bi-spectrum contour map and finally form a high-dimensional feature vector. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector, thus highlighting main fault features and reducing subsequent computing resources, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is adopt to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector. At last, probabilistic neural network is introduced for fault identification. Two typical rotating machinery, axial piston hydraulic pump and self-priming centrifugal pumps, are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method based on image-processing achieves a high accuracy, thus providing a highly effective means to fault diagnosis for rotating machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2529381634,"Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) improve alveolar and vascular structures in experimental models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Female MSC secrete more anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors as compared to male MSC. Whether the therapeutic efficacy of MSC in attenuating lung injury in an experimental model of BPD is influenced by the sex of the donor MSC or recipient is unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that female MSC would have greater lung regenerative properties than male MSC in experimental BPD and this benefit would be more evident in males. Objective To determine whether intra-tracheal (IT) administration of female MSC to neonatal rats with experimental BPD has more beneficial reparative effects as compared to IT male MSC. Methods Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to normoxia (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 2- P21 were randomly assigned to receive male or female IT bone marrow (BM)-derived green fluorescent protein (GFP+) MSC (1 x 106 cells/50 μl), or Placebo on P7. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), vascular remodeling, alveolarization, and angiogenesis were assessed at P21. PH was determined by measuring right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and pulmonary vascular remodeling was evaluated by quantifying the percentage of muscularized peripheral pulmonary vessels. Alveolarization was evaluated by measuring mean linear intercept (MLI) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Angiogenesis was determined by measuring vascular density. Data are expressed as mean ± SD, and analyzed by ANOVA. Results There were no significant differences in the RA groups. Exposure to hyperoxia resulted in a decrease in vascular density and RAC, with a significant increase in MLI, RVSP, and the percentage of partially and fully muscularized pulmonary arterioles. Administration of both male and female MSC significantly improved vascular density, alveolarization, RVSP, percent of muscularized vessels and alveolarization. Interestingly, the improvement in PH and vascular remodeling was more robust in the hyperoxic rodents who received MSC from female donors. In keeping with our hypothesis, male animals receiving female MSC, had a greater improvement in vascular remodeling. This was accompanied by a more significant decrease in lung pro-inflammatory markers and a larger increase in anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic markers in male rodents that received female MSC. There were no significant differences in MSC engraftment among groups. Conclusions Female BM-derived MSC have greater therapeutic efficacy than male MSC in reducing neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and vascular remodeling. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of female MSC were more pronounced in male animals. Together, these findings suggest that female MSC maybe the most potent BM-derived MSC population for lung repair in severe BPD complicated by PH."
https://openalex.org/W2529418719,"Microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) nucleate microtubules that can grow autonomously in any direction. To generate bundles of parallel microtubules originating from a single MTOC, the growth of multiple microtubules needs to coordinated, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that a conserved two-component system consisting of the plus-end tracker EB1 and the minus-end-directed molecular motor Kinesin-14 is sufficient to promote parallel microtubule growth. The underlying mechanism relies on the ability of Kinesin-14 to guide growing plus ends along existing microtubules. The generality of this finding is supported by yeast, Drosophila, and human EB1/Kinesin-14 pairs. We demonstrate that plus-end guiding involves a directional switch of the motor due to a force applied via a growing microtubule end. The described mechanism can account for the generation of parallel microtubule networks required for a broad range of cellular functions such as spindle assembly or cell polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2528449354,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) show strong antibacterial properties, making them excellent candidates to be used in orthopaedic repair and regeneration. However, there are concerns regarding the cytotoxicity of AgNPs and molecular mechanisms underlying AgNPs-induced bone cells toxicity have not been elucidated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore mechanisms of AgNPs-induced osteoblast cell death with particular emphasis on the role of nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).Silver nanoparticles used in this study were 18.3±2.6 nm in size, uncoated, spherical, regular shape and their zeta potential was -29.1±2.4 mV as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and zetasizer. The release of silver (Ag) from AgNPs was measured in cell culture medium by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The exposure of human osteoblast cells (hFOB 1.19) to AgNPs at concentration of 30 or 60 μg/mL for 24 or 48 hours, respectively resulted in cellular uptake of AgNPs and changes in cell ultrastructure. These changes were associated with apoptosis and necrosis as shown by flow cytometry and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay as well as increased levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and decreased levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA and protein. Importantly, we have found that AgNPs elevated the levels of nitric oxide (NO) with concomitant upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein. A significant positive correlation was observed between the concentration of AgNPs and iNOS at protein and mRNA level (r = 0.837, r = 0.721, respectively; p<0.001). Finally, preincubation of osteoblast cells with N-iminoethyl-l-lysine (L-NIL), a selective iNOS inhibitor, as well as treating cells with iNOS small interfering RNAs (siRNA) significantly attenuated AgNPs-induced apoptosis and necrosis. Moreover, we have found that AgNPs-induced cells death is not related to Ag dissolution is cell culture medium.These results unambiguously demonstrate that increased expression of iNOS and generation of NO as well as NO-derived reactive species is involved in AgNPs-induced osteoblast cell death. Our findings may help in development of new strategies to protect bone from AgNPs-induced cytotoxicity and increase the safety of orthopaedic tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2529570112,"A cohort study was undertaken to analyze the risk of recurrence among 1616 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx from 1983 to 2010 at a single, tertiary academic center in Oslo, Norway. The cohort was followed from the date of diagnosis to September 2011. Competing risk regression analysis assessed the association between various risk factors and the risk of recurrence, where death was considered a competing event. Recurrence was observed in 368 patients (23%) during the study period. The majority (71%) of recurrences involved the location of the primary tumor. The overall risk of recurrence during the first three years after initiating treatment was 20.5%. Increased risk of recurrence was observed in patients with supraglottic cancer, younger patients, those with T2-T3 tumors and in patients treated in the earlier part of the study period. Significant factors for recurrence in glottic carcinomas were age, treatment in the earlier part of the study and T-status, whereas age was a significant factor in supraglottic cancer. N-status appeared less significant. In conclusion, follow-up of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma should place particular emphasis on the site of the primary tumor, younger patients, cases of supraglottic cancer and T2-T4 primary tumors, especially during the first three years after treatment. More studies are needed to assess the impact of surgical versus non-surgical treatment, and eventually the significance of recurrence, for disease-specific and overall survival in cases of advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2529518419,"This study describes the antimicrobial resistance temporal trends and seasonal variation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) urinary tract infections (UTIs) over five years, from 2009 to 2013, and compares prevalence of resistance in hospital- and community-acquired E. coli UTI. A cross sectional study of E. coli UTIs from patients attending a tertiary referral hospital in Canberra, Australia was undertaken. Time series analysis was performed to illustrate resistance trends. Only the first positive E. coli UTI per patient per year was included in the analysis. A total of 15,022 positive cultures from 8724 patients were identified. Results are based on 5333 first E. coli UTIs, from 4732 patients, of which 84.2% were community-acquired. Five-year hospital and community resistance rates were highest for ampicillin (41.9%) and trimethoprim (20.7%). Resistance was lowest for meropenem (0.0%), nitrofurantoin (2.7%), piperacillin-tazobactam (2.9%) and ciprofloxacin (6.5%). Resistance to amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefazolin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam were significantly higher in hospital- compared to community-acquired UTIs (9.3% versus 6.2%; 15.4% versus 9.7%; 5.2% versus 3.7% and 5.2% versus 2.5%, respectively). Trend analysis showed significant increases in resistance over five years for amoxycillin-clavulanate, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, cefazolin, ceftriaxone and gentamicin (P<0.05, for all) with seasonal pattern observed for trimethoprim resistance (augmented Dickey-Fuller statistic = 4.136; P = 0.006). An association between ciprofloxacin resistance, cefazolin resistance and ceftriaxone resistance with older age was noted. Given the relatively high resistance rates for ampicillin and trimethoprim, these antimicrobials should be reconsidered for empirical treatment of UTIs in this patient population. Our findings have important implications for UTI treatment based on setting of acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2528112556,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lactate are endproducts of rumen fermentation and important energy sources for the host ruminant. Because their rapid accumulation results in ruminal acidosis, enhancement of the absorption of SCFA and lactate across reticuloruminal wall is instrumental in increasing energy supply and preventing ruminal acidosis in cattle. This study investigated whether the reticuloruminal absorption of SCFAs and lactate was altered by different strategies of high concentrate feeding. Eight rumen-cannulated, non-lactating Holstein cows were fed a forage-only diet (baseline) and then gradually adapted over 6 d to a 60% concentrate level. Thereafter, this concentrate-rich diet was fed for 4 wk either continuously (Con; n = 8) or interruptedly (Int; n = 8). Absorption of SCFAs and lactate was determined in vivo from the experimental buffer introduced into the washed reticulorumen. The buffer contained acetate, propionate, butyrate and lactate at a concentration of 60, 30, 10 and 5 mmol/L, respectively and Cr-EDTA as a marker for correcting ruminal water fluxes. The reticuloruminal absorption after 35 and 65 min of buffer incubation was measured at the baseline, after 1 wk of 60% concentrate feeding in the interrupted model (Int-1) and after 4 wk of concentrate feeding in both feeding models (Int-4 and Con-4). Data showed that the absorption rates of individual and total SCFAs during the first 35 min of incubation of Con-4 were highest (~1.7 times compared to baseline), while Int-1 and Int-4 were similar to respective baseline. Lactate was not absorbed during forage-only baseline and 1-wk concentrate feeding, but after 4-wk feeding of concentrates in both models. In conclusion, SCFAs absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle was enhanced by the 4-wk continuous concentrate feeding, which seems to be more advantageous in terms of rumen acidosis prevention compared to the interrupted feeding model. The study provides evidence of lactate absorption across the reticulorumen of non-lactating cattle after both continuous and interrupted 4-wk concentrate feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2529089430,"Heat shock proteins belong to a conserved protein family and are involved in multiple cellular processes. Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), also known as heat HSPB1, participates in cellular responses to not only heat shock, but also oxidative or chemical stresses. However, the contribution of HSPB1 to anti-oxidative response remains unclear. Here, we show that HSPB1 activates G6PD in response to oxidative stress or DNA damage. HSPB1 enhances the binding between G6PD and SIRT2, leading to deacetylation and activation of G6PD. Besides, HSPB1 activates G6PD to sustain cellular NADPH and pentose production in glioma cells. High expression of HSPB1 correlates with poor survivalrate of glioma patients. Together, our study uncovers the molecular mechanism by which HSPB1 activates G6PD to protect cells from oxidative and DNA damage stress."
https://openalex.org/W2529479209,"Porphyromonas gingivalis utilises the Bacteroidetes-specific type IX secretion system (T9SS) to export proteins across the outer membrane (OM), including virulence factors such as the gingipains. The secreted proteins have a conserved carboxy-terminal domain essential for type IX secretion that is cleaved upon export. In P. gingivalis the T9SS substrates undergo glycosylation with anionic lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) and are attached to the OM. In this study, comparative analyses of 24 Bacteroidetes genomes identified ten putative novel components of the T9SS in P. gingivalis, one of which was PG1058. Computer modelling of the PG1058 structure predicted a novel N- to C-terminal architecture comprising a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a β-propeller domain, a carboxypeptidase regulatory domain-like fold (CRD) and an OmpA_C-like putative peptidoglycan binding domain. Inactivation of pg1058 in P. gingivalis resulted in loss of both colonial pigmentation and surface-associated proteolytic activity; a phenotype common to T9SS mutants. Immunoblot and LC-MS/MS analyses of subcellular fractions revealed T9SS substrates accumulated within the pg1058 mutant periplasm whilst whole-cell ELISA showed the Kgp gingipain was absent from the cell surface, confirming perturbed T9SS function. Immunoblot, TEM and whole-cell ELISA analyses indicated A-LPS was produced and present on the pg1058 mutant cell surface although it was not linked to T9SS substrate proteins. This indicated that PG1058 is crucial for export of T9SS substrates but not for the translocation of A-LPS. PG1058 is a predicted lipoprotein and was localised to the periplasmic side of the OM using whole-cell ELISA, immunoblot and LC-MS/MS analyses of subcellular fractions. The structural prediction and localisation of PG1058 suggests that it may have a role as an essential scaffold linking the periplasmic and OM components of the T9SS."
https://openalex.org/W2528717226,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stands out as a major mental illness; however, little is known about effective policies for mitigating the problem. The importance and complexity of PTSD raise critical questions: What are the trends in the population of PTSD patients among military personnel and veterans in the postwar era? What policies can help mitigate PTSD? To address these questions, we developed a system dynamics simulation model of the population of military personnel and veterans affected by PTSD. The model includes both military personnel and veterans in a ""system of systems."" This is a novel aspect of our model, since many policies implemented at the military level will potentially influence (and may have side effects on) veterans and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The model is first validated by replicating the historical data on PTSD prevalence among military personnel and veterans from 2000 to 2014 (datasets from the Department of Defense, the Institute of Medicine, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other sources). The model is then used for health policy analysis. Our results show that, in an optimistic scenario based on the status quo of deployment to intense/combat zones, estimated PTSD prevalence among veterans will be at least 10% during the next decade. The model postulates that during wars, resiliency-related policies are the most effective for decreasing PTSD. In a postwar period, current health policy interventions (e.g., screening and treatment) have marginal effects on mitigating the problem of PTSD, that is, the current screening and treatment policies must be revolutionized to have any noticeable effect. Furthermore, the simulation results show that it takes a long time, on the order of 40 years, to mitigate the psychiatric consequences of a war. Policy and financial implications of the findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2528183260,"Childhood Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and impairing condition that can be effectively treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). However, a majority of children and adolescents do not have access to CBT. Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) has been suggested as a way to increase availability to effective psychological treatments. Yet, the research on ICBT in children and adolescents has been lagging behind significantly both when it comes to quantitative as well as qualitative studies. The aim of the current study was to describe the experience of ICBT in adolescents with OCD.Eight adolescents with OCD that had received ICBT were interviewed with qualitative methodology regarding their experiences of the intervention. Data was summarized into thematic categories.Two overarching themes were identified, autonomy and support, each consisting of three primary themes (self-efficacy, flexibility, secure self-disclosure and clinician support, parental support, identification/normalization, respectively).The experiential hierarchical model that was identified in this study is, in part, transferrable to previous research. In addition, it highlights the need of further study of important process variables of ICBT in young patient populations."
https://openalex.org/W2509986823,"Sympathy crying is an odd and complex mixture of physiological and emotional phenomena. Standard psychophysiological theories of emotion cannot attribute crying to a single subdivision of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and disagreement exists regarding the emotional origin of sympathy crying. The current experiment examines sympathy crying using functional thermal infrared imaging (FTII), a novel contactless measure of ANS activity. To induce crying female participants were given the choice to decide which film they wanted to cry to. Compared to baseline, temperature started increasing on the forehead, the peri-orbital region, the cheeks and the chin before crying and reached even higher temperatures during crying. The maxillary area showed the opposite pattern and a gradual temperature decrease was observed compared to baseline as a result of emotional sweating. The results suggest that tears of sympathy are part of a complex autonomic interaction between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems, with the latter preceding the former. The emotional origin of the phenomenon seems to derive from subjective internal factors that relate to one’s personal experiences and attributes with tears arising in the form of catharses or as part of shared sadness."
https://openalex.org/W2528629101,"Objective The objective of this study was to investigate whether moderately increased maternal age is associated with obstetric and neonatal outcome in a contemporary population, and to consider the possible role of co-morbidities in explaining any increased risk. Study Design Secondary analysis of routinely collected data from a large maternity unit in London, UK. Data were available on 51,225 singleton deliveries (≥22 weeks) occurring to women aged ≥20 between 2004 and 2012. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate risk ratios for the association between maternal age and obstetric and neonatal outcome (delivery type, postpartum haemorrhage, stillbirth, low birthweight, preterm birth, small for gestational age, neonatal unit admission), using the reference group 20–24 years. Population attributable fractions were calculated to quantify the population impact. Results We found an association between increasing maternal age and major postpartum haemorrhage (≥1000ml blood loss) (RR 1.36 95% CI 1.18–1.57 for age 25–29 rising to 2.41 95% CI 2.02–2.88 for age ≥40). Similar trends were observed for caesarean delivery, most notably for elective caesareans (RR 1.64 95% CI 1.36–1.96 for age 25–29 rising to 4.94 95% CI 4.09–5.96 for age ≥40). There was evidence that parity modified this association, with a higher prevalence of elective caesarean delivery in older nulliparous women. Women aged ≥35 were at increased risk of low birthweight and preterm birth. We found no evidence that the risk of stillbirth, small for gestational age, or neonatal unit admission differed by maternal age. Conclusions Our results suggest a gradual increase in the risk of caesarean delivery and postpartum haemorrhage from age 25, persisting after taking into account maternal BMI, hypertension and diabetes. The risk of low birthweight and preterm birth was elevated in women over 35. Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the high prevalence of elective caesarean delivery in nulliparous older mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2528545264,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in a variety of intracellular events such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and programmed cell death. MAPKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues through sequential activation of protein kinases. Recent studies have shown that the protein kinases involved in MAPK signal transductions might be organized into signaling complexes by scaffold proteins. These scaffold proteins are essential regulators that function by assembling the relevant molecular components in mammalian cells. In this study, we report that dual-specificity phosphatase 22 (DUSP22), a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family, acts as a distinct scaffold protein in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. DUSP22 increased the phosphorylation in the activation loop of JNK regardless of its phosphatase activity but had no effect on phosphorylation levels of ERK and p38 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, DUSP22 selectively associated with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7), and JNK1/2. Both JNK phosphorylation and JNK-mediated apoptosis increased in a concentration-dependent manner regardless of DUSP22 phosphatase activity at low DUSP22 concentrations, but then decreased at higher DUSP22 concentrations, which is the prominent feature of a scaffold protein. Thus, our data suggest that DUSP22 regulates cell death by acting as a scaffold protein for the ASK1-MKK7-JNK signal transduction pathway independently of its phosphatase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2949374631,"To study how a bacterium allocates its resources, we compared the costs and benefits of most (86%) of the proteins in Escherichia coli K-12 during growth in minimal glucose medium. The cost or investment in each protein was estimated from ribosomal profiling data, and the benefit of each protein was measured by assaying a library of transposon mutants. We found that proteins that are important for fitness are usually highly expressed, and 95% of these proteins are expressed at above 13 parts per million (ppm). Conversely, proteins that do not measurably benefit the host (with a benefit of less than 5% per generation) tend to be weakly expressed, with a median expression of 13 ppm. In aggregate, genes with no detectable benefit account for 31% of protein production, or about 22% if we correct for genetic redundancy. Although some of the apparently unnecessary expression could have subtle benefits in minimal glucose medium, the majority of the burden is due to genes that are important in other conditions. We propose that at least 13% of the cell’s protein is “on standby” in case conditions change."

Five species of Avicennia in the Indo-West Pacific region have been previously described. However, their phylogenetic relationships were determined based on morphological and allozyme data. To enhance our understanding of evolutionary patterns in the clade, we carried out a molecular phylogenetic study using wide sampling and multiple loci. Our results support two monophyletic clades across all species worldwide in Avicennia: an Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) lineage and an Indo-West Pacific (IWP) lineage. This split is in line with biogeographic distribution of the clade. Focusing on the IWP branch, we reconstructed a detailed phylogenetic tree based on sequences from 25 nuclear genes. The results identified three distinct subclades, (1) A. rumphiana and A. alba, (2) A. officinalis and A. integra, and (3) the A. marina complex, with high bootstrap support. The results strongly corresponded to two morphological traits in floral structure: stigma position in relation to the anthers and style length. Using Bayesian dating methods we estimated diversification of the IWP lineage was dated to late Miocene (c. 6.0 million years ago) and may have been driven largely by the fluctuating sea levels since that time."
https://openalex.org/W2528781707,"Objective There is a critical need to identify biomarkers and objective outcome measures that can be used to understand underlying neural mechanisms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) offer a noninvasive technique to evaluate the functional integrity of neural mechanisms, specifically visual pathways, while probing for disease pathophysiology. Methods Transient VEPs (tVEPs) were obtained from 96 unmedicated children, including 37 children with ASD, 36 typically developing (TD) children, and 23 unaffected siblings (SIBS). A conventional contrast-reversing checkerboard condition was compared to a novel short-duration condition, which was developed to enable objective data collection from severely affected populations who are often excluded from electroencephalographic (EEG) studies. Results Children with ASD showed significantly smaller amplitudes compared to TD children at two of the earliest critical VEP components, P60-N75 and N75-P100. SIBS showed intermediate responses relative to ASD and TD groups. There were no group differences in response latency. Frequency band analyses indicated significantly weaker responses for the ASD group in bands encompassing gamma-wave activity. Ninety-two percent of children with ASD were able to complete the short-duration condition compared to 68% for the standard condition. Conclusions The current study establishes the utility of a short-duration tVEP test for use in children at varying levels of functioning and describes neural abnormalities in children with idiopathic ASD. Implications for excitatory/inhibitory balance as well as the potential application of VEP for use in clinical trials are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2529277621,"The control of infectious diseases is a major current challenge in intensive aquaculture. Most commercial vaccines are based on live attenuated or inactivated pathogens that are usually combined with adjuvants, oil emulsions being as the most widely used for vaccination in aquaculture. Although effective, the use of these oil emulsions is plagued with important side effects. Thus, the development of alternative safer and cost-effective immunostimulants and adjuvants is highly desirable. Here we have explored the capacity of inclusion bodies produced in bacteria to immunostimulate and protect fish against bacterial infections. Bacterial inclusion bodies are highly stable, non-toxic protein-based biomaterials produced through fully scalable and low-cost bio-production processes. The present study shows that the composition and structured organization of inclusion body components (protein, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, DNA and RNA) make these protein biomaterials excellent immunomodulators able to generically protect fish against otherwise lethal bacterial challenges. The results obtained in this work provide evidence that their inherent nature makes bacterial inclusion bodies exceptionally attractive as immunostimulants and this opens the door to the future exploration of this biomaterial as an alternative adjuvant for vaccination purposes in veterinary."
https://openalex.org/W2528443451,"Thioredoxin (Trx) is an oxidoreductase with important physiological function. Imbalances in the NADPH/thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system are associated with a number of pathologies, particularly cancer, and a number of clinical trials for thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase inhibitors have been carried out or are underway. Due to the emerging role and importance of oxidoreductases for haemostasis and the current interest in developing inhibitors for clinical use, we thought it pertinent to assess whether inhibition of the NADPH/thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system affects platelet function and thrombosis. We used small molecule inhibitors of Trx (PMX 464 and PX-12) to determine whether Trx activity influences platelet function, as well as an unbiased proteomics approach to identify potential Trx substrates on the surface of platelets that might contribute to platelet reactivity and function. Using LC-MS/MS we found that PMX 464 and PX-12 affected the oxidation state of thiols in a number of cell surface proteins. Key surface receptors for platelet adhesion and activation were affected, including the collagen receptor GPVI and the von Willebrand factor receptor, GPIb. To experimentally validate these findings we assessed platelet function in the presence of PMX 464, PX-12, and rutin (a selective inhibitor of the related protein disulphide isomerase). In agreement with the proteomics data, small molecule inhibitors of thioredoxin selectively inhibited GPVI-mediated platelet activation, and attenuated ristocetin-induced GPIb-vWF-mediated platelet agglutination, thus validating the findings of the proteomics study. These data reveal a novel role for thioredoxin in regulating platelet reactivity via proteins required for early platelet responses at sites of vessel injury (GPVI and GPIb). This work also highlights a potential opportunity for repurposing of PMX 464 and PX-12 as antiplatelet agents."
https://openalex.org/W2529646416,"The Malayan box turtle (Cuora amboinensis) (MBT) is a vulnerable and protected turtle species, but it is a lucrative item in the illegal wildlife trade because of its great appeal as an exotic food item and in traditional medicine. Although several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to identify MBT by various routes have been documented, their applicability for forensic authentication remains inconclusive due to the long length of the amplicon targets, which are easily broken down by natural decomposition, environmental stresses or physiochemical treatments during food processing. To address this research gap, we developed, for the first time, a species-specific PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay with a very short target length (120 bp) to detect MBT in the food chain; this authentication ensured better security and reliability through molecular fingerprints. The PCR-amplified product was digested with Bfa1 endonuclease, and distinctive restriction fingerprints (72, 43 and 5 bp) for MBT were found upon separation in a microfluidic chip-based automated electrophoresis system, which enhances the resolution of short oligos. The chances of any false negative identifications were eliminated through the use of a universal endogenous control for eukaryotes, and the limit of detection was 0.0001 ng DNA or 0.01% of the meat under admixed states. Finally, the optimized PCR-RFLP assay was validated for the screening of raw and processed commercial meatballs, burgers and frankfurters, which are very popular in most countries. The optimized PCR-RFLP assay was further used to screen MBT materials in 153 traditional Chinese medicines of 17 different brands and 62 of them were found MBT positive; wherein the ingredients were not declared in product labels. Overall, the novel assay demonstrated sufficient merit for use in any forensic and/or archaeological authentication of MBT, even under a state of decomposition."
https://openalex.org/W2528686449,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by loss of motor neurons. ALS patients experience rapid deterioration in muscle function with an average lifespan of 3-5 years after diagnosis. Currently, the most effective therapeutic only extends lifespan by a few months, thus highlighting the need for new and improved therapies. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are important for neuronal development, maintenance, and survival. NTF treatment has previously shown efficacy in pre-clinical ALS models. However, clinical trials using NTFs produced no major improvements in ALS patients, due in part to the limited blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. In this study we assessed the potential neuroprotective effects of a novel class of compounds known as MicroNeurotrophins (MNTs). MNTs are derivatives of Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an endogenous neurosteroid that can cross the BBB and bind to tyrosine kinase receptors mimicking the pro-survival effects of NTFs. Here we sought to determine whether MNTs were neuroprotective in two different models of ALS. Our results demonstrate that BNN27 (10 μM) attenuated loss of motor neurons co-cultured with astrocytes derived from human ALS patients with SOD1 mutations via the reduction of oxidative stress. Additionally, in the G93A SOD1 mouse, BNN27 (10 mg/kg) treatment attenuated motor behavioral impairment in the paw grip endurance and rotarod tasks at postnatal day 95 in female but not male mice. In contrast, BNN27 (10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) treatment did not alter any other behavioral outcome or neuropathological marker in male or female mice. Lastly, BNN27 was not detected in post-mortem brain or spinal cord tissue of treated mice due to the rapid metabolism of BNN27 by mouse hepatocytes relative to human hepatocytes. Together, these findings demonstrate that BNN27 treatment failed to yield significant neuroprotective effects in the G93A SOD1 model likely due to its rapid rate of metabolism in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2529678976,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. BH4 and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) are metabolically interchangeable at the expense of NADPH. Exogenously administered BH4 can be metabolized by the body, similar to vitamins. At present, synthetic BH4 is used as an orphan drug for patients with inherited diseases requiring BH4 supplementation. BH4 supplementation has also drawn attention as a means of treating certain cardiovascular symptoms, however, its application in human patients remains limited. Here, we tracked biopterin (BP) distribution in blood, bile, urine, liver, kidney and brain after BH4 administration (5 mg/kg rat, i.v.) with or without prior treatment with probenecid, a potent inhibitor of uptake transporters particularly including organic anion transporter families such as OTA1 and OAT3. The rapid excretion of BP in urine was driven by elevated blood concentrations and its elimination reached about 90% within 120 min. In the very early period, BP was taken up by the liver and kidney and gradually released back to the blood. BH4 administration caused a considerable decrease in the BH4% in blood BP as an inevitable compensatory process. Probenecid treatment slowed down the decrease in blood BP and simultaneously inhibited its initial rapid excretion in the kidney. At the same time, the BH4% was further lowered, suggesting that the probenecid-sensitive BP uptake played a crucial role in BH2 scavenging in vivo. This suggested that the overproduced BH2 was taken up by organs by means of the probenecid-sensitive process, and was then scavenged by counter-conversion to BH4 via the BH4 salvage pathway. Taken together, BH4 administration was effective at raising BP levels in organs over the course of hours but with extremely low efficiency. Since a high BH2 relative to BH4 causes NOS dysfunction, the lowering of the BH4% must be avoided in practice, otherwise the desired effect of the supplementation in ameliorating NOS dysfunction would be spoiled."
https://openalex.org/W2529121408,"Rapid cooling of aqueous solutions is a useful approach for two important biological applications: (I) cryopreservation of cells and tissues for long-term storage, and (II) cryofixation for ultrastructural investigations by electron and cryo-electron microscopy. Usually, both approaches are very different in methodology. Here we show that a novel, fast and easy to use cryofixation technique called self-pressurized rapid freezing (SPRF) is–after some adaptations–also a useful and versatile technique for cryopreservation. Sealed metal tubes with high thermal diffusivity containing the samples are plunged into liquid cryogen. Internal pressure builds up reducing ice crystal formation and therefore supporting reversible cryopreservation through vitrification of cells. After rapid rewarming of pressurized samples, viability rates of > 90% can be reached, comparable to best-performing of the established rapid cooling devices tested. In addition, the small SPRF tubes allow for space-saving sample storage and the sealed containers prevent contamination from or into the cryogen during freezing, storage, or thawing."
https://openalex.org/W2527887519,"In sickle cell disease (SCD), the inflammatory properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) can be changed by cell-free hemoglobin (Hb), which is released into the blood during hemolysis. Hb in the plasma of SCD patients or mice can bind with HDL specifically inducing an inflammatory reaction. In our study, we found increased amounts of inflammatory factor proteins in the chronic oxidative state of SCD with higher levels of Hb, haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hx) in the apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-1) particles of HDL and the role of HDL is changed from being anti-inflammatory to proinflammatory. Our results also suggest Hp and Hx, the scavengers of Hb in HDL, are positively associated with inflammatory levels in SCD patients. HDL retained its inflammatory inhibition role in Hp-/- mice, with less Hb accumulation. Hx may further prevent inflammatory reaction because its level will be even higher when lack of Hx. We therefore demonstrated that Hp is indispensable during the process whereby Hb associates with HDL and plays a clear proinflammatory role. Therefore, it is essential to break the binding between Hb and Hp for treatment. The dissociation of Hb/Hp/Hx complexes may also play an important role in the study of other inflammatory angiogenesis-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2528291562,"Mouse has been extensively used as a tool for investigating the onset and development of human neurological disorders. As a first step to construct a transgenic mouse model of human brain lesions, it is of fundamental importance to clarify the similarity and divergence of genetic background between non-diseased human and mouse brain tissues.We systematically compared, based on large scale integrated microarray data, the transcriptomes of three anatomically distinct brain regions; prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HIP) and striatum (STR), across human and mouse. The widely used DAVID web server was used to decipher the biological functions of the highly expressed genes that were identified using a previously reported approach. Venn analysis was used to depict the overlapping ratios of the notably enriched biological process (BP) terms (one-tailed Fisher's exact test and Benjamini correction; adjusted p < 0.01) between two brain tissues. GOSemSim, an R package, was selected to perform GO semantic similarity analysis. Next, we adjusted signal intensities of orthologous genes by the total signals in all samples within species, and used one minus Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess the expression distance. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were selected for expression pattern analysis. Lineage specific expressed orthologous genes were identified by comparison of the most extreme sub-datasets across species and further verified using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).We found that the number of the significantly enriched BP terms of the highly expressed genes in human brain regions is larger than that in mouse corresponding brain regions. The mainly involved BP terms in human brain tissues associated with protein-membrane targeting and selenium metabolism are species-specific. The overlapping ratios of all the significantly enriched BP terms between any two brain tissues across species are lower than that within species, but the pairwise semantic similarities are very high between any two brain tissues from either human or mouse. Hierarchical clustering analysis shows the biological functions of the highly expressed genes in brain tissues are more consistent within species than interspecies; whereas it shows the expression patterns of orthologous genes are evidently conserved between human and mouse equivalent brain tissues. In addition, we identified four orthologous genes (COX5B, WIF1, SLC4A10 and PLA2G7) that are species-specific, which have been widely studied and confirmed to be closely linked with neuro- physiological and pathological functions.Our study highlights the similarities and divergences in gene function and expression between human and mouse corresponding brain regions, including PFC, HIP and STR."
https://openalex.org/W2529526113,"Programmed cell death is a ubiquitous process in metazoan development. Apoptosis, one cell death form, has been studied extensively. However, mutations inactivating key mammalian apoptosis regulators do not block most developmental cell culling, suggesting that other cell death pathways are likely important. Recent work in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans identified a non-apoptotic cell death form mediating the demise of the male-specific linker cell. This cell death process (LCD, linker cell-type death) is morphologically conserved, and its molecular effectors also mediate axon degeneration in mammals and Drosophila. To develop reagents to manipulate LCD, we established a simple high-throughput screening protocol for interrogating the effects of small molecules on C. elegans linker cell death in vivo. From 23,797 compounds assayed, 11 reproducibly block linker cell death onset. Of these, five induce animal lethality, and six promote a reversible developmental delay. These results provide proof-of principle validation of our screening protocol, demonstrate that developmental progression is required for linker cell death, and suggest that larger scale screens may identify LCD-specific small-molecule regulators that target the LCD execution machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2529525510,"Chitotriosidase (Chit1) is an enzyme associated with various diseases, including Gaucher disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer disease and cystic fibrosis. In this study, we first expressed mouse mature Chit1 fused with V5 and (His)6 tags at the C-terminus (Chit1-V5-His) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and found that most of the expressed protein was insoluble. In contrast, Chit1 tagged with Protein A at the N-terminus and V5-His at the C-terminus, was expressed in the periplasmic space of E. coli as a soluble protein and successfully purified. We evaluated the chitinolytic properties of the recombinant enzyme using 4-nitrophenyl N,N'-diacetyl-β-D-chitobioside [4NP-chitobioside, 4NP-(GlcNAc)2] and found that its activity was comparable to CHO cells-expressed Chit1-V5-His. Optimal conditions for the E. coli-produced Chit1 were pH ~5.0 at 50°C. Chit1 was stable after 1 h incubation at pH 5.0~11.0 on ice and its chitinolytic activity was lost at pH 2.0, although the affinity to chitin remained unchanged. Chit1 efficiently cleaved crystalline and colloidal chitin substrates as well as oligomers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) releasing primarily (GlcNAc)2 fragments at pH 5.0. On the other hand, (GlcNAc)3 was relatively resistant to digestion by Chit1. The degradation of 4NP-(GlcNAc)2 and (GlcNAc)3 was less evident at pH 7.0~8.0, while (GlcNAc)2 production from colloidal chitin and (GlcNAc)6 at these pH conditions remained strong at the neutral conditions. Our results indicate that Chit1 degrades chitin substrates under physiological conditions and suggest its important pathophysiological roles in vivo."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between SES (measured using education) and CE/CBVD in a cohort study, as well as to investigate lifestyle and clinical risk factors, to help to clarify the mechanisms by which SES influences CE/CBVD.We searched for diagnoses of CE and CBVD in the clinical records of 47,749 members of the EPICOR cohort (average follow-up time: 11 years). SES was determined by the relative index of inequality (RII).A total of 1,156 CE and 468 CBVD were found in the clinical records. An increased risk of CE was observed in the crude Cox model for the third tertile of RII compared to the first tertile (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-1.61). The increased risk persisted after adjustment for lifestyle risk factors (HR = 1.19; 95%CI 1.02-1.38), clinical risk factors (HR = 1.35; 95%CI 1.17-1.56), and after full adjustment (HR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.01-1.37). Structural equation model showed that lifestyle rather than clinical risk factors are involved in the mechanisms by which education influences CE. No significant association was found between education and CBVD. A strong relationship was observed between education and diabetes at baseline.The most important burden of inequality in CE incidence in Italy is due to lifestyle risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2529259238,"Evidence suggests neuroprotective effects of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), on the developed neurons in the adult brain. In contrast, the drug may be deleterious to immature or undifferentiated neural cells, although the mechanism is unclear. Recent investigations have suggested that microRNAs (miRNA) may be critical for effectiveness of psychotropic drugs including SSRI. We investigated whether fluoxetine could modulate expressions of neurologically relevant miRNAs in two neuroblastoma SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y cell lines. Initial screening results revealed that three (miR-489, miR-572 and miR-663a) and four (miR-320a, miR-489, miR-572 and miR-663a) miRNAs were up-regulated in SK-N-SH cells and SH-SY5Y cells, respectively, after 24 hours treatment of fluoxetine (1-25 μM). Cell viability was reduced according to the dose of fluoxetine. The upregulation of miR-572 and miR-663a was consistent in both the SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells, confirmed by a larger scale culture condition. Our data is the first in vitro evidence that fluoxetine could increase the expression of miRNAs in undifferentiated neural cells, and that putative target genes of those miRNAs have been shown to be involved in fundamental neurodevelopmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2528195666,"Recent research has suggested that the case-control study design, unlike the self-controlled study design, performs poorly in controlling confounding in the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data, resulting in biased estimates of the causal effects of drugs on health outcomes of interest (HOI) and inaccurate confidence intervals. Here we show that using rich data on comorbidities and automatic variable selection strategies for selecting confounders can better control confounding within a case-control study design and provide a more solid basis for inference regarding the causal effects of drugs on HOIs. Four HOIs are examined: acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction and gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. For each of these HOIs we use a previously published reference set of positive and negative control drugs to evaluate the performance of our methods. Our methods have AUCs that are often substantially higher than the AUCs of a baseline method that only uses demographic characteristics for confounding control. Our methods also give confidence intervals for causal effect parameters that cover the expected no effect value substantially more often than this baseline method. The case-control study design, unlike the self-controlled study design, can be used in the fairly typical setting of EHR databases without longitudinal information on patients. With our variable selection method, these databases can be more effectively used for the detection of ADRs."
https://openalex.org/W2528560315,"Host-derived proteases can augment or help to clear infections. This dichotomy is exemplified by cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps Hendra virus and SARS coronavirus to invade cells, but is essential for survival in mice with mycoplasma pneumonia. The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL. Ctsl-/- mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) had larger lung viral loads and higher mortality than infected Ctsl+/+ mice. Lung inflammation in surviving infected mice peaked 14 days after initial infection, accompanied marked focal distal airway bronchiolization and epithelial metaplasia followed by desquamation and fibrotic interstitial remodeling, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Most deaths occurred during the second week of infection in both groups of mice. In contrast to mycoplasma pneumonia, infiltrating cells were predominantly mononuclear rather than polymorphonuclear. The histopathology of lung inflammation and remodeling in survivors was similar in Ctsl-/- and Ctsl+/+ mice, although Ctsl+/+ mice cleared immunoreactive virus sooner. Furthermore, Ctsl-/- mice had profound deficits in CD4+ lymphocytes before and after infection and weaker production of pathogen-specific IgG. Thus, CTSL appears to support innate as well as adaptive responses, which confer a survival advantage on mice infected with the orthomyxovirus influenza A."

https://openalex.org/W2527774982,"Background and Purpose Understanding the anatomy of the anterior septal vein (ASV) is critical for minimally invasive procedures to the third ventricle and for assessing lesion size and venous drainage in the anterior cranial fossa. Accordingly, this study evaluated topographic anatomy and anatomic variation of the ASV using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Methods Sixty volunteers were examined using a 3.0T MR system. The diameter of the ASV and distance between bilateral septal points were measured. ASVs were divided into types 1 (only drains frontal lobe) and 2 (drains both frontal lobe and head of the caudate nucleus). We evaluated the ASV-internal cerebral vein (ICV) junction based on its positional relationship with the appearance of a venous angle or a false venous angle and the foramen of Monro. Fused SW and T1-weighted images were used to observe positional relationships between the course of the ASV and the surrounding brain structures. Results The ASV and its small tributaries were clearly visualized in 120 hemispheres (100%). The average diameter of ASVs was 1.05±0.17 mm (range 0.9–1.6 mm). The average distance between bilateral septal points was 2.23±1.03 mm (range 1.3–6.6 mm). The ASV types 1 and 2 were in 77 (64.2%) and 43 (35.8%) hemispheres, respectively. In 83 (69.2%) hemispheres, the ASV-ICV junction was situated at the venous angle and the posterior margin of the foramen of Monro. In 37 (30.8%) hemispheres, the ASV-ICV junction was situated beyond the posterior margin of the foramen of Monro. The average distance between the posteriorly located ASV-ICV junction and the posterior margin of the foramen of Monro was 6.41±3.95 mm (range 2.4–15.9 mm). Conclusion Using SWI, the topographic anatomy and anatomic variation of the ASV were clearly demonstrated. Preoperative assessment of anatomic variation of the ASV may be advantageous for minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2528031773,"Background: In previous work in young women aged 15-30 years we measured breast water and fat using MR and obtained blood for hormone assays on the same day in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Only serum growth hormone levels and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were significantly associated with percent breast water after adjustment for covariates. The sex hormones estradiol, progesterone and testosterone were not associated with percent water in the breast in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. In the present study we have examined the association of percent breast water with serum levels of sex hormones in both follicular and luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Methods: In 315 healthy white Caucasian young women aged 15-30 with regular menstrual cycles who had not used oral contraceptives or other hormones in the previous 6 months, we used MR to determine percent breast water, and obtained blood samples for hormone assays within 10 days of the onset of the most recent menstrual cycle (follicular phase) of the cycle on the same day as the MR scan, and a second blood sample on days 19-24 of the cycle. Serum progesterone levels of > = 5 mmol/L in days 19-24 were used to define the 225 subjects with ovulatory menstrual cycles, whose data are the subject of the analyses shown here. Results: SHBG was positively associated with percent water in both follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Total and free estradiol and total and free testosterone were not associated with percent water in the follicular phase, but in young women with ovulatory cycles, were all negatively associated with percent water in the luteal phase. Conclusions: Our results from young women aged 15-30 years add to the evidence that the extent of fibroglandular tissue in the breast that is reflected in both mammographic density and breast water is associated positively with higher serum levels of SHBG, but not with higher levels of sex hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2529706281,"LIM homeobox 8 (Lhx8) is a germ cell-specific transcription factor essential for the development of oocytes during early oogenesis. In mice, Lhx8 deficiency causes postnatal oocyte loss and affects the expression of many oocyte-specific genes. The aims of this study were to characterize the bovine Lhx8 gene, determine its mRNA expression during oocyte development and early embryogenesis, and evaluate its interactions with other oocyte-specific transcription factors. The bovine Lhx8 gene encodes a protein of 377 amino acids. A splice variant of Lhx8 (Lhx8_v1) was also identified. The predicted bovine Lhx8 protein contains two LIM domains and one homeobox domain. However, one of the LIM domains in Lhx8_v1 is incomplete due to deletion of 83 amino acids near the N terminus. Both Lhx8 and Lhx8_v1 transcripts were only detected in the gonads but none of the somatic tissues examined. The expression of Lhx8 and Lhx8_v1 appears to be restricted to oocytes as none of the transcripts was detectable in granulosa or theca cells. The maternal Lhx8 transcript is abundant in GV and MII stage oocytes as well as in early embryos but disappear by morula stage. A nuclear localization signal that is required for the import of Lhx8 into nucleus was identified, and Lhx8 is predominantly localized in the nucleus when ectopically expressed in mammalian cells. Finally, a novel interaction between Lhx8 and Figla, another transcription factor essential for oogenesis, was detected. The results provide new information for studying the mechanisms of action for Lhx8 in oocyte development and early embryogenesis."

Corm formation is a complex biological process, and extensive whole genome analysis of transcripts during corm development has not been carried out. In this study, four corm libraries at different developmental stages were constructed, and gene expression was identified using a high-throughput tag sequencing technique. Approximately 4.9 million tags were sequenced, and 4,371,386, 4,372,602, 4,782,494, and 5,276,540 clean tags, including 119,676, 110,701, 100,089, and 101,239 distinct tags, respectively, were obtained after removal of low-quality tags from each library. More than 39% of the distinct tags were unambiguous and could be mapped to reference genes, while 40% were unambiguous tag-mapped genes. After mapping their functions in existing databases, a total of 11,592, 10,949, 10,585, and 7,111 genes were annotated from the B1, B2, B3, and B4 libraries, respectively. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in B1/B2, B2/B3, and B3/B4 libraries showed that most of the DEGs at the B1/B2 stages were involved in carbohydrate and hormone metabolism, while the majority of DEGs were involved in energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism at the B2/B3 and B3/B4 stages. All of the upregulated transcription factors and 9 important genes related to product organ formation in the above four stages were also identified. The expression changes of nine of the identified DEGs were validated using a quantitative PCR approach.

https://openalex.org/W2529187433,"Decreasing the use of antimicrobials has become a primary objective for both human and veterinary medicine in many countries. Medical prevention and good nutrition are seen as key parameters for reducing antimicrobial use. However, little consideration has been given to how metabolic diseases may influence the use of antimicrobials in humans and animals through limiting the prevalence and severity of infectious diseases. To quantify this relationship using the example of a common metabolic disease in dairy cows (subclinical ketosis, SCK), we constructed a stochastic model reporting the total quantity of curative antimicrobials for a given population with the prevalence of cows at risk for SCK. We considered the prevalence of SCK, the relative risk of the disease in cases of SCK compared to no SCK and the use of antimicrobials to treat SCK-induced infectious diseases. Reducing the percentage of cows at risk for SCK from 80% to 10% was associated with an average decrease in the use of antimicrobials of 11% (prevalence of SCK from 34% to 17%, respectively) or 25% (prevalence of SCK from 68% to 22%, respectively), depending on the relative risk to contract SCK if risk was present. For a large percentage of the cows at risk for SCK, using a preventive bolus of monensin reduced the use of curative antimicrobials to the same level that was observed when the percentage of cows at risk for SCK was low. The present work suggests similar approaches for obesity and diabetes."

Medical records were reviewed for 203 women and 527 infants. The risk ratio (RR) between antibiotic treatment and 1) delivery mode in women; 2) prematurity in infants was calculated. Length of stay and days of antibiotic therapy were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Women: There was an association between emergency caesarean section (CS) and antibiotic treatment (RR 5.0 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-11.5), but not for elective CS. Length of stay was longer for CS (emergency and elective) compared to vaginal delivery (p<0.01). Infants: RR for antibiotic treatment in preterm compared to term infants was 1.4 (95% CI 1.0-1.9). Length of stay (p<0.01), but not days of therapy (p = 0.17), was higher in preterm compared to term infants.We found that emergency CS increased the probability of maternal antibiotic treatment during hospitalisation, but no difference was found between term and preterm infants. The results are well aligned with current guidelines and may be considered in future studies on the effects of antibiotics."

However, the effect of nebivolol on the vasomotor tone of cerebral arteries is still unclear. Objective To assess the effects of nebivolol on the diameter of isolated rat basilar arteries (BA) in control, in the presence of inhibitors of vasomotor signaling pathways of know action and hemolysed blood. Methods and Results Vasomotor responses were measured by videomicroscopy and the intracellular Ca2+ by the Fura-2 AM ratiometric method. Under control conditions, nebivolol elicited a substantial dilation of the BA (from 216±22 to 394±20 μm; p<0.05) in a concentration-dependent manner (10−7 to 10−4 M). The dilatation was significantly reduced by endothelium denudation or by L-NAME (inhibitor of NO synthase) or by SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase blocker). Dilatation of BA was also affected by beta-2 receptor blockade with butoxamine, but not by the guanylate cyclase blocker ODQ. Interestingly, beta-1 blockade by atenolol inhibited nebivolol-induced dilation. Also, the BKCa channel blocker iberiotoxin and KCa channel inhibitor TEA significantly reduced nebivolol-induced dilation. Nebivolol significantly reduced smooth muscle Ca2+ level, which correlated with the increases in diameters and moreover it reversed the hemolysed blood-induced constriction of BA. Conclusions Nebivolol seems to have an important dilator effect in cerebral arteries, which is mediated via several vasomotor mechanisms, converging on the reduction of smooth muscle Ca2+ levels. As such, nebivolol may be effective to improve cerebral circulation in various diseased conditions, such as hemorrhage."
https://openalex.org/W2529613690,"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a disabling autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are effective in CIDP, but the treatment response varies greatly between individual patients. Understanding this interindividual variability and predicting the response to IVIg constitute major clinical challenges in CIDP. We previously established intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 deficient non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice as a novel animal model of CIDP. Here, we demonstrate that similar to human CIDP patients, ICAM-1 deficient NOD mice respond to IVIg treatment by clinical and histological measures. Nerve magnetic resonance imaging and histology demonstrated that IVIg ameliorates abnormalities preferentially in distal parts of the sciatic nerve branches. The IVIg treatment response also featured great heterogeneity allowing us to identify IVIg responders and non-responders. An increased production of interleukin (IL)-17 positively predicted IVIg treatment responses. In human sural nerve biopsy sections, high numbers of IL-17 producing cells were associated with younger age and shorter disease duration. Thus, our novel animal model can be utilized to identify prognostic markers of treatment responses in chronic inflammatory neuropathies and we identify IL-17 production as one potential such prognostic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2529745371,"Neuroectodermal tumours are characterized by aberrant processing of disialogangliosides concomitant with high expression of GD2 or GD3 on cell surfaces. Antibodies targeting GD2 are already in clinical use for therapy of neuroblastoma, a solid tumour of early childhood. Here, we set out to identify peptides with high affinity to human disialoganglioside GD2. To this end, we performed a combined in vivo and in vitro screen using a recombinant phage displayed peptide library. We isolated a phage displaying the peptide sequence WHWRLPS that specifically binds to the human disialoganglioside GD2. Binding specificity was confirmed by mutational scanning and by comparative analyses using structurally related disialogangliosides. In vivo, significant enrichment of phage binding to xenografts of human neuroblastoma cells in mice was observed. Tumour-specific phage accumulation could be blocked by intravenous coinjection of the corresponding peptide. Comparative pharmacokinetic analyses revealed higher specific accumulation of 68Ga-labelled GD2-binding peptide compared to 111In-labelled peptide in xenografts of human neuroblastoma. In contrast to 124I-MIBG, which is currently evaluated as a neuroblastoma marker in PET/CT, 68Ga-labelled GD2-specific peptide spared the thyroid but was enriched in the kidneys, which could be partially blocked by infusion of amino acids.In summary, we here report on a novel tumour-homing peptide that specifically binds to the disialoganglioside GD2, accumulates in xenografts of neuroblastoma cells in mice and bears the potential for tumour detection using PET/CT. Thus, this peptide may serve as a new scaffold for diagnosing GD2-positive tumours of neuroectodermal origin."
https://openalex.org/W2528209611,"The deeper we look at human genomes, the more unexpected things we find. And increasingly we are surprised by what each of us lacks. In particular, in recent years we have learned that naturally occurring human gene knockouts are prevalent. The results of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) now paint a rich and detailed picture of gene redundancy and essentiality in humans (Lek et al., 2016Lek M. Karczewski K.J. Minikel E.V. Samocha K.E. Banks E. Fennell T. O’Donnell-Luria A.H. Ware J.S. Hill A.J. Cummings B.B. et al.Exome Aggregation ConsortiumNature. 2016; 536: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar). The breadth of individuals who had their protein-coding regions of their genomes sequenced by ExAC is impressive, with the effort cataloging variation in more than 60,000 individuals from diverse ancestries. Within this cohort, more than 7 million individual variants are reported, which averages out to a variant occurring every eight base pairs throughout protein-coding regions. Just more than half of these are observed only once—that is, in a single individual—and the vast majority of these were not observed in previous sequencing efforts, such as the 1000 Genomes Project. This suggests that many more variants will be uncovered by sequencing yet more people, but the sample size is sufficient to begin to approach saturation for some kinds of mutation, including the most common type, transition variants at CpG sites. For example, a majority of all of the theoretically possible variants are observed synonymous mutations at CpG sites. With this depth of variant identification, we now have a clear understanding of which individual genes and gene classes are more commonly the target of protein truncating variants. The frequency or infrequency of such protein-truncating variants tells us which are so critical as to never tolerate disruption and those that can seemingly be lost without repercussion. Reassuringly, the gene classes most intolerant of loss-of-function (LOF) protein-truncating variants are core to the basic workings of the cell (components of the ribosome, proteasome, spliceosome, etc.), whereas the gene family that is least constrained by mutational tinkering is olfactory receptors. The grouping of genes least tolerant of protein-truncating variants also contains nearly all known haploinsufficient human disease genes, and the authors speculate that this group is likely to yield numerous other genes with a discernible impact on fitness. How often are protein-truncating variants found in humans? The findings of Lek et al. suggest that there is an average of 35 genes homozygous for protein truncating variation per person, which is in the ballpark of previous estimates (MacArthur et al., 2012MacArthur D.G. Balasubramanian S. Frankish A. Huang N. Morris J. Walter K. Jostins L. Habegger L. Pickrell J.K. Montgomery S.B. et al.1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumScience. 2012; 335: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). This is to say that most of us manage just fine with three dozen genes out of action, and this doesn’t include potential variation in non-coding regions that might also impact a gene’s expression. As mentioned before, not all genes are created equal in terms of fitness costs and benefits, but of the ∼20,000 protein coding genes in humans, the ExAC effort reveals 1,775 genes among those with predicted homozygous LOF genotypes. It remains to be seen how many of these come with discernable phenotypes on close examination. For anyone who has scratched their head at a knockout mouse with seemingly no discernible phenotype—the bane of many a grad student project—the existence of this degree of diversity of human gene knockouts may resonate as much as it shocks. Regardless, these are striking numbers to think about, and they hammer home the notion that, with this richer understanding of our genetic diversity, humans soon will be (or already are) the model organism of choice for the study of genetics. Rare homozygous knockouts in particular should be informative about gene function. In a study reported earlier this year, the exomes of 3,222 British adults of Pakistani heritage were analyzed and used to identify individuals with rare homozygous loss-of-function variants (Narasimhan et al., 2016Narasimhan V.M. Hunt K.A. Mason D. Baker C.L. Karczewski K.J. Barnes M.R. Barnett A.H. Bates C. Bellary S. Bockett N.A. et al.Science. 2016; 352: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This population was chosen for its higher rate of marriage between first cousins, which would be expected to enrich for homozygous gene knockouts. Additionally, the exome analysis could readily be linked to health records to draw potential links with disease. Although the individuals identified harboring rare gene knockouts did not present as unusually unhealthy in this study, as indicated by their rates of medical consultation and drug prescription, there is likely much information yet to be gleaned. And as with the findings of Mongkol et al., the phenotypic effects of homozygous loss-of-function genotypes need to be explored individually. But this begs the question, what kind of things can we learn from “knockout humans”? Narasimhan et al. provide a nice example through the characterization of an individual identified with LOF variants in PRDM9, a histone methyltransferase that influences locations chosen for meiotic recombination. Analysis of the individual and her child shows that sites of meiotic recombination were indeed localized away from PRDM9-dependent hotspots. The fact that she had a child might not have been predicted from the existing knockout mice, which are infertile. Neither do the resulting changes in recombination sites match the overall pattern observed in dogs, which lack PRDM9 altogether, suggesting that there are yet unexplored mechanisms for directing crossover events in humans. It seems that what we lack or can do without is fundamental to understanding our uniquely human biology."
https://openalex.org/W2529631666,"Quality of reporting for Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) in oncology was analyzed in several systematic reviews, but, in this setting, there is paucity of data for the outcomes definitions and consistency of reporting for statistical tests in RCTs and Observational Studies (OBS). The objective of this review was to describe those two reporting aspects, for OBS and RCTs in oncology.From a list of 19 medical journals, three were retained for analysis, after a random selection: British Medical Journal (BMJ), Annals of Oncology (AoO) and British Journal of Cancer (BJC). All original articles published between March 2009 and March 2014 were screened. Only studies whose main outcome was accompanied by a corresponding statistical test were included in the analysis. Studies based on censored data were excluded. Primary outcome was to assess quality of reporting for description of primary outcome measure in RCTs and of variables of interest in OBS. A logistic regression was performed to identify covariates of studies potentially associated with concordance of tests between Methods and Results parts.826 studies were included in the review, and 698 were OBS. Variables were described in Methods section for all OBS studies and primary endpoint was clearly detailed in Methods section for 109 RCTs (85.2%). 295 OBS (42.2%) and 43 RCTs (33.6%) had perfect agreement for reported statistical test between Methods and Results parts. In multivariable analysis, variable ""number of included patients in study"" was associated with test consistency: aOR (adjusted Odds Ratio) for third group compared to first group was equal to: aOR Grp3 = 0.52 [0.31-0.89] (P value = 0.009).Variables in OBS and primary endpoint in RCTs are reported and described with a high frequency. However, statistical tests consistency between methods and Results sections of OBS is not always noted. Therefore, we encourage authors and peer reviewers to verify consistency of statistical tests in oncology studies."
https://openalex.org/W2527863840,"Extrafloral structures are supposed to have evolved to protect flowers from harsh physical environments but might have effects on pollination. Overlapping leaves cover flowers in Eriophyton wallichii, an alpine perennial endemic to the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains. In previous study, it has showed that these extrafloral leaves can protect interior flowers from temperature fluctuations caused by drastic solar radiation fluctuations, but these leaves may also protect interior flowers from rain wash and UVB damage, and we do not know which one is the main function. In this study, we investigated whether rain and UVB protection are the main functions of overlapping leaves covering flowers and their potential impact on pollination. We first measured the intensities of UVB radiation in open air, beneath leaves and corollas, and then examined pollen susceptibility to different intensities of UVB and rain in the laboratory to estimate whether corollas per se protect interior pollen from UVB and rain damage. We also carried out pollination treatments and observed pollinator visitation of flowers with and without leaves in the field to assess whether the overlapping leaves covering flowers impair pollinator attraction. Our results showed that (1) water and strong UVB significantly decreased pollen germinability, but corollas per se could protect pollen from UVB and rain damage; (2) no autonomous self-pollination and apomixis occurred, and pollinators were essential for the reproduction of E. wallichii; however, flower coverage by overlapping leaves did not limit pollination. We suggested that rain and UVB protection was not the main function of overlapping leaves covered flowers, given that this protection can be provided by corollas per se. Alternatively, this extrafloral structure in E. wallichii may have evolved in response to extreme high temperatures associated with the strong solar radiation fluctuations. This indicates that, even in alpine plants, extreme high temperature may affect the evolution of plant extrafloral structures."
