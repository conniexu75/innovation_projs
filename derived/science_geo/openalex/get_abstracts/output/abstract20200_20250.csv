https://openalex.org/W1581065404,"The alternative complement pathway is best known for its role in humoral suppression of infectious agents. We have previously shown that adipose cells synthesize adipsin, the mouse homolog of human complement factor D, and that the synthesis of this protein is reduced in several rodent models of obesity. We show here that adipose cells and adipose tissue also synthesize two other essential components of the alternative pathway of complement, factors C3 and B, and activate the proximal portion of this pathway. This activation occurs in the absence of infectious agents and without triggering the terminal, lytic part of this pathway. We demonstrate the production in vitro of several polypeptides characteristic of complement activation that are known to have potent biological activities, including the anaphylatoxin C3a. Cultured adipocytes require stimulation with cytokines to activate complement, while explanted adipose tissue has no such requirement. The adipose tissue from obese mice is deficient in this localized activation of the alternative pathway. These results indicate that complement activation occurs in a localized site, adipose tissue, in normal mice and is impaired in a state of metabolic dysfunction. This suggests a novel function for the proximal portion of this complement pathway related to adipose cell biology or energy balance."
https://openalex.org/W2110905842,"Deletion of the amino-terminal 17 residues from human ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) resulted in a protein ([delta 1-17]mARF1p) devoid of ARF activity but which retained the ability to bind guanine nucleotides with high affinity. Unlike the wild type, the binding of guanine nucleotides to this deletion mutant was found to be independent of added phospholipids. A chimeric protein was produced, consisting of 10% (the amino-terminal 17 amino acids) human ARF1p and 90% ARL1p, an ARF-like protein (55% identical protein sequence) from Drosophila. This chimera was found to have ARF activity, lacking in the parental ARL1 protein. Thus, the amino terminus of ARF1p was shown to be a critical component of ARF activity. A synthetic peptide, derived from the amino terminus of ARF1p, has no ARF activity. Rather, the peptide was found to be a specific inhibitor of ARF activities. This peptide was also found to be a potent and specific inhibitor of both an in vitro intra-Golgi transport assay and the guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-stimulated accumulation of coated vesicles and buds from Golgi preparations. We conclude that ARF is required for the budding of coated vesicles from the Golgi stacks and serves a regulatory role in protein secretion through the Golgi in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1538657525,"By resolving immunoprecipitates on nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, we have detected several disulfide-bonded intermediates in folding within the endoplasmic reticulum of newly made H1 subunits of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. H1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be partially unfolded by treatment of cells with dithiothreitol, but H1 in Golgi or post-Golgi organelles is resistant to such unfolding. This defines a late step in H1 folding that occurs just prior to exit from the ER. Depletion of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, either by treatment with A23187 or thapsigargin, has no effect on folding or secretion of newly made albumin, but totally blocks H1 maturation from the ER. No ER intermediates in H1 folding are formed in cells treated with A23187 or thapsigargin, indicating that at least an early step in H1 folding requires a high Ca2+ concentration in the ER lumen. As judged by cross-linking experiments, formation of H1 dimers and trimers occurs immediately after biosynthesis of the peptide chain, before monomer folding, and occurs normally in cells in which ER Ca2+ is reduced and where the monomer never folds properly. Calcium is essential for the asialoglycoprotein receptor to bind galactose, and our results suggest that Ca2+ is also essential for the receptor polypeptides to fold in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1504892441,"We describe the potential role of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) in vesicular trafficking using an in vitro assay that efficiently reconstitutes transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cis-Golgi compartment in mammalian semi-intact cells, a population of cells in which the plasma membrane is physically perforated to reveal intact ER and Golgi compartments. We demonstrate that peptides identical to the amino-terminal domain of ARF, which inhibit ARF cofactor activity in cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of G alpha S (Kahn, R. A., Randazzo, P., Serafini, T., Weiss, O., Rulka, C., Clark, J., Amherdt, M., Roller, P., Orci, L., and Rothman, J. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13039-13046), inhibit transport of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein between the ER and cis-Golgi compartment. Inhibition of transport was rapid (t1/2 = 30-60 s) and irreversible. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at concentrations of 15 and 22 microM with peptides identical to the amino-terminal domain of the human ARF4 (hARF4) protein and the human ARF1 protein, respectively. Kinetic analysis of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein transport suggested that the hARF4 peptide inhibits a late vesicle fusion step. In addition, incubation of semi-intact cells in the presence of the myristoylated form human ARF1 (hARF1myr) protein, but not the nonmyristoylated form of ARF1, inhibited transport. In contrast to peptide, the hARF1myr blocked an early transport step, similar to that observed with guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. These results suggest that ARF and components facilitating ARF function play an important role in the cyclical fission and fusion of transport vesicles mediating ER to Golgi trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1574246355,"Over 80 beta-1,4-glucanases and beta-1,4-xylanases can be classified into one of eight families on the basis of amino acid sequence similarities in their catalytic domains (Gilkes, N. R., Henrissat, B., Kilburn, D. G., Miller, R. C., Jr., and Warren, R. A. J. (1991) Microbiol. Rev. 55, 303-315). As a test of this classification, the stereochemical course of hydrolysis of 10 enzymes representative of five families has been determined using proton NMR. These data, together with published data for six additional enzymes, show that representatives of a given enzyme family have the same stereoselectivity: four families catalyze hydrolysis with retention of anomeric configuration, two with inversion. The results support the hypothesis that family members share a common general fold, active site topology, and catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1535032041,"The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex of the platelet plasma membrane mediates the adhesion of platelets to damaged blood vessel wall. The complex is composed of three membrane-spanning polypeptides, GP Ib alpha, GP Ib beta, and GP IX, all of which are absent from the platelets of patients with the hereditary bleeding disorder Bernard-Soulier syndrome. In this study we report stable expression of the recombinant receptor in three cell lines and demonstrate that the three subunits of the complex are necessary for its efficient expression on the plasma membrane. The expressed complex associates with the cytoskeleton of the transfected cells through an interaction with actin-binding protein and binds its ligand, von Willebrand factor. These data suggest that the lack of plasma membrane GP Ib-IX complex in the Bernard-Soulier syndrome could potentially arise from mutations affecting any one of its three subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2120402446,"Epithelin 1 and 2 were originally purified from rat kidneys based on their ability to inhibit the growth of A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells (Shoyab, M., McDonald, V.L., Byles, C., Todaro, G.J., and Plowman, G.D. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 7912-7916). This study presents the complete amino acid sequence of these two growth factors and the cloning of their cDNA from rat, mouse, and human sources. Epithelins 1 and 2 are 56- and 57-amino acid polypeptides, respectively, and share 47% amino acid sequence identity with the conserved spacing of 12 cysteine residues. Molecular cloning revealed that both proteins are encoded by a single precursor that contains 7 1/2 copies of this novel 12-cysteine motif, 2 of which represent the known active molecules. Recombinant expression in COS cells demonstrated that the epithelin 1 protein was mitogenic on rodent keratinocytes and fibroblasts. In contrast, epithelin 2 had no activity on these cells, but at high concentrations was capable of antagonizing the growth proliferative activities of epithelin 1. Northern analysis shows the epithelin mRNA to be expressed in many types of epithelial cells. The broad expression profile of epithelin transcripts, along with the opposing activities of the two mature protein products, implicates these factors as natural mediators of epithelial homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1529589684,"We have used an in vitro endosome fusion assay, recombinant ARF, synthetic peptides, and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) to study the role of ARF during endocytosis. Previous work has shown that GTP gamma S stimulates in vitro endosome fusion in dilute cytosol (less than 0.5 mg/ml) but inhibits fusion in concentrated cytosol (greater than 1.0 mg/ml). Two peptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal 16 amino acids of human ARF1 and ARF4 blocked GTP gamma S stimulation of fusion in dilute cytosol and reversed GTP gamma S inhibition of fusion in concentrated cytosol. The addition of recombinant human ARF1 to endosomes in dilute or concentrated cytosol resulted in GTP gamma S-dependent inhibition of fusion. Only the myristoylated form of ARF inhibited fusion. The NH2-terminal ARF1 peptide reversed inhibition by recombinant ARF1. Preincubation experiments showed that endosomes could form an ARF-resistant intermediate during the fusion process. Western blot analysis revealed clathrin-coated vesicles extracted with detergent retained ARF. The results suggest that ARF is involved in both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of GTP gamma S in dilute and concentrated cytosol, respectively. Furthermore, myristoylation, the NH2-terminal domain, and binding to GTP appear to be critical for ARF activity during an early prefusion step required for endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1513018272,"The effects of inducible expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PADPRP) antisense RNA in HeLa cells were determined in order to gain further insight into the biological roles of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation modification of nuclear proteins. A recombinant expression plasmid was prepared with the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter upstream of the antisense-oriented PADPRP cDNA. Expression of the antisense RNA was under strict control, with negligible effects on cell growth being apparent in the absence of inducer. Consistent with the previously described stability of PADPRP (half-life of at least 2 days, in vivo), 48-72 h were required after induction of antisense RNA expression by dexamethasone for the abundant concentration of PADPRP, normally present in HeLa cells, to be reduced by greater than 80%. The depletion of endogenous PADPRP as mediated by induced antisense RNA expression was established by: (i) a progressive synthesis of antisense transcripts in cells as assessed by Northern analysis; (ii) an 80% decrease in activity of the enzyme; and (iii) a greater than 90% reduction in the cellular content of PADPRP protein, as demonstrated by both immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis in intact cells. Several biological parameters were monitored in cells depleted of PADPRP. The chromatin of PADPRP-depleted cells was shown to have an altered structure as assessed by deoxyribonuclease I susceptibility. Cell morphology was also altered, with multinucleated aggregates being evident 72 h after induction of antisense RNA expression. Cells depleted of PADPRP were not able to commence DNA strand break joining of damaged DNA. However, DNA repair capacity was re-established at later time periods, indicating that PADPRP may contribute to alterations in chromatin structure that occur initially in DNA strand break rejoining and that the concentration of the enzyme in nuclei exceeds the requirement for DNA repair/replication."
https://openalex.org/W1592772777,"Protein kinase C (PKC), the major receptor for tumor-promoting phorbol esters, consists of a family of at least eight distinct lipid-regulated enzymes. How the various PKC isozymes are regulated in vivo and how they couple to particular cellular responses is largely unknown. We have examined the expression and regulation of PKC isoforms in R6 rat embryo fibroblasts. Northern and Western blot analyses indicate that these cells express four PKC isoforms, cPKC alpha, nPKC epsilon, nPKC delta, and nPKC zeta; of which nPKC epsilon and nPKC delta are the most abundant. In agreement with the simultaneous presence of cPKC and nPKC isozymes, both Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent PKC activities were detected in extracts of these cells. cPKC alpha and nPKC zeta were predominantly localized in the cytosol when subcellular fractionation was carried out in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid. When cell lysis was carried out in the presence of Ca2+, greater than 50% of cPKC alpha redistributed to the particulate fraction, whereas nPKC zeta remained in the cytosol. In contrast to cPKC alpha and nPKC zeta, 60-80% of nPKC epsilon and nPKC delta were located in a Ca(2+)-insensitive, membrane-bound form. Treatment of R6 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), resulted in the translocation of all four PKC isozymes to the membrane fraction, and the subsequent down-regulation of cPKC alpha, nPKC zeta, and nPKC delta, nPKC epsilon, however, was only partially down-regulated in response to long-term TPA exposure. Overproduction of exogenous cPKC beta I in R6 cells conferred partial resistance of nPKC delta to TPA-induced down-regulation and potentiated the resistance of nPKC epsilon to down-regulation. These results demonstrate that the multiple isoforms of PKC which coexist within a single cell type are differentially regulated by extra- and intracellular stimuli and may thereby influence growth control and transformation via distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1581643673,"We have previously demonstrated that in non-oncogenic adenovirus-transformed baby rat kidney cells a complex of hsp27 and a 22-kDa protein is present, which is lacking in oncogenic cells (Zantema, A., de Jong, E., Lardenoije, R., and van der Eb, A. J. (1989) J. Virol. 63, 3368-3375). Here we show that the 22-kDa protein is identical to alpha B-crystallin. The complex of hsp27 and alpha B-crystallin is also found in some other (non-transformed) cells. However, in most cells tested only hsp27 and no alpha B-crystallin is synthesized. Gel filtration studies show that both proteins are present almost exclusively in a 700-kDa complex. Heat treatment makes the complex fall apart, which is accompanied by a change in the conformation of alpha B-crystallin. Upon recovery, complexes are formed again from both pre-existing and newly synthesized proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1524705290,"Several distinct mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the beta form of the thyroid hormone receptor have been reported in kindreds with the autosomal dominant syndrome of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH). GRTH receptor mutants are functionally inactive but capable of inhibiting normal receptor function in transient expression studies. We examined the possibility that this dominant negative activity of the GRTH mutants involves competition for receptor binding to DNA. Mutations introduced into either the T3 ligand-binding domain (LBD) or into the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the receptor eliminated the transcriptional activity of the receptor. In cotransfection experiments, the LBD mutants, but not the DBD mutants, inhibited the transcriptional activity of the normal receptor. The inhibitory activity of the LBD mutants was abolished by the introduction of an additional mutation into the DBD, suggesting that the DBD is required for dominant negative activity. A chimeric receptor, in which the DNA-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor was exchanged with the homologous region in the glucocorticoid receptor (GTG), was used to study thyroid hormone receptor competition for GTG interactions with thyroid receptor target sequences. In the absence of thyroid hormone, the normal thyroid hormone receptor inhibited dexamethasone stimulated transcription by GTG. The transcriptional activity of GTG was also inhibited by the LBD mutants but not by a DBD mutant of the thyroid hormone receptor. These results indicate that the thyroid hormone receptor mutations that occur in GRTH compete with normal receptors at DNA-binding sites in target genes to block normal receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1578846813,"The gene for protein L, an immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain-binding protein expressed by some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus, was cloned and sequenced. The gene translates into a protein of 719 amino acid residues. Following a signal sequence of 18 amino acids and a NH2-terminal region (A) of 79 residues, the molecule contains five homologous repeats of 72-76 amino acids each. Further, toward the COOH terminus, two additional repeats (C) were found. These are not related to the repeats, but are highly homologous to each other. After the C repeats (52 amino acids each), a hydrophilic, proline-rich putative cell wall-spanning region (W) was found, followed at the COOH-terminal end by a hydrophobic membrane anchor (M). Fragments of the gene were expressed, and the corresponding peptides were analyzed for Ig-binding activity. The B repeats were found to be responsible for the interaction with Ig light chains. An Escherichia coli high level expression system was adapted for the production of large amounts of two Ig-binding protein L fragments comprising one and four B repeats, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1512735145,"The deacylation and reacylation process of phospholipids is the major pathway of turnover and repair in erythrocyte membranes. In this paper, we have investigated the role of carnitine palmitoyltransferase in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid fatty acid turnover. The role of acyl-L-carnitine as a reservoir of activated acyl groups, the buffer function of carnitine, and the importance of the acyl-CoA/free CoA ratio in the reacylation process of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids have also been addressed. In intact erythrocytes, the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitic acid into acyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine was linear with time for at least 3 h. The greatest proportion of the radioactivity was found in acyl-L-carnitine. Competition experiments using [1-14C]palmitic and [9,10-3H]oleic acid demonstrated that [9,10-3H]oleic acid was incorporated preferentially into the phospholipids and less into acyl-L-carnitine. When an erythrocyte suspension was incubated with [1-14C]palmitoyl-L-carnitine, radiolabeled palmitate was recovered in the phospholipid fraction, and the carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, 2-tetradecylglycidic acid, completely abolished the incorporation. ATP depletion decreased incorporation of [1-14C]palmitic and/or [9,10-3H]oleic acid into acyl-L-carnitine, but the incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine was unaffected. In contrast, ATP depletion enhanced the incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine of the radiolabeled fatty acid from [1-14C]palmitoyl-L-carnitine. These data are suggestive of the existence of an acyl-L-carnitine pool, in equilibrium with the acyl-CoA pool, which serves as a reservoir of activated acyl groups. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibition by 2-tetradecylglycidic acid or palmitoyl-D-carnitine caused a significant reduction of radiolabeled fatty acid incorporation into membrane phospholipids, only when intact erythrocytes were incubated with [9,10-3H]oleic acid. These latter data may be explained by the differences in rates and substrates specificities between acyl-CoA synthetase and the reacylating enzymes for palmitate and oleate, which support the importance of carnitine palmitoyltransferase in modulating the optimal acyl-CoA/free CoA ratio for the physiological expression of the membrane phospholipids fatty acid turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1561166157,"DNA primases encoded by the conjugative plasmids ColIb-P9 (IncI1), RP4, and R751 (IncP), and the protein of the Escherichia coli satellite phage P4 alpha were shown to contain a common amino acid sequence motif -E-G-Y-A-T-A-. The P4 alpha gene product, required for initiation of phage DNA replication, exhibits primase activity on single-stranded circular DNA templates. This priming activity resembles the enzymatic activity of DNA primases encoded by conjugative plasmids in terms of template utilization and the ability to synthesize primers that can be elongated by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The -E-G-Y-A-T-A- motif is part of an extended sequence region most conserved within the primase domains of the four enzymes. Single amino acid substitutions generated in the -E-G-Y-A-T-A- motif of the RP4 TraC2 and the P4 alpha protein affect priming activity, supporting the hypothesis that the conserved sequence motif is part of the active center for primase function. mutation that eliminates priming activity causes P4 phage to grow poorly and to depend upon the host dnaG primase. Computer analysis identified two additional sequence motifs within the amino acid sequence of the P4 alpha protein: a potential zinc-finger motif and a type A nucleotide binding site, both strikingly similar to sequence motifs described in various DNA primases and helicases."
https://openalex.org/W1488146504,"There are several antigenic variants in Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, and a type-specific antigen (TSA) of 56-kilodaltons located on the rickettsial surface is responsible for the variation. The primary structures of the protein in two variants, Gilliam and Karp, have been reported independently by us and Stover et al. by cloning and sequencing the corresponding genes (Ohashi, N., Nashimoto, H., Ikeda, H., and Tamura, A. (1990) Gene (Amst.) 91, 119-122; Stover, C. K., Marana, D. P., Carter, J. M., Roe, B. A., Mardis, E., and Oaks, E. V. (1990) Infect. Immun. 58, 2076-2084). In the present study, genes encoding the TSA homologues of the other four variants, Kato, Kawasaki, Kuroki, and Shimokoshi, which are all distinguishable serologically, were cloned and sequenced, and consequently, it became possible to compare the primary structures of the six antigenic variants. The sequence analyses revealed a complete open reading frame encoding 55,308-56,745-dalton proteins with 521-532 amino acids, in which a putative signal peptide consisting of 22 amino acids was recognized at the NH2-terminal end. Transcription of the gene is regulated by several tandem promoters. All TSA molecules have the characteristics of transmembrane proteins with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, and contain four variable domains with spans of 16-40 amino acids which are located in the hydrophilic regions in the molecule and show different amino acid sequences among the strains. Phylogenetic classification among the R. tsutsugamushi strains based on TSA homologues supports the antigenic relationships known in the closely and distantly related strains."
https://openalex.org/W1582533342,"In the heart, mRNA accumulations for sarcomeric actins and myosin heavy chains (MHC) are subject to diverse regulatorial processes. To study cardiac contractile protein transcriptional regulations, an in vitro transcription system using nonenzymatically isolated rat cardiac nuclei was characterized. Transcription was shown to be rapid and continuous during the first 20 min of incubation and 5.4-fold less than that seen from comparably isolated hepatocyte nuclei. Neither RNase nor DNase activities were detectable. Direct transcriptional analyses of the alpha- and beta-MHC and cardiac and skeletal alpha-actin genes from cardiac nuclei were performed. In 23-24-day-old rats, significant levels of transcription were seen for alpha-MHC and for the sarcomeric alpha-actins. beta-MHC was just detectable, and no positive signals were ever seen for fibronectin. We then compared the perecentages of MHC and sarcomeric alpha-actin expressions determined from 1) the transcriptional assays and 2) total isolated RNA (alpha-MHC: 90.1 +/- 4.8% (transcription), 93.0 +/- 4.7% (accumulation); beta-MHC: 9.9 +/- 4.8%, 7.0 +/- 4.7%; cardiac alpha-actin: 84.0 +/- 2.5%, 84.9 +/- 2.5%; skeletal alpha-actin: 16.1 +/- 2.5%, 15.0 +/- 2.5%). The results support the conclusion that the primary mechanisms controlling the accumulations of these gene products are transcriptional. Additionally, we show that an anti-sense mRNA showing strong homology or identity with the 5' end of the beta-MHC gene is transcribed in cardiac nuclei but not in hepatocyte nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1570729505,"A UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase from porcine submaxillary glands was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. IgG prepared from antisera against the pure enzyme immunoprecipitated the transferase in Triton X-100 extracts of submaxillary glands. The submaxillary transferase is a membrane-bound enzyme in contrast to the pure bovine colostrum enzyme, which is soluble in the absence of detergents. Both transferases have similar properties but also differ significantly. Examination of the acceptor substrate specificity of the submaxillary gland transferase showed that it specifically transferred N-acetylgalactosamine from UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group of threonine and was devoid of transferase activity toward serine-containing peptides. These results imply that more than one transferase is involved in forming the GalNAc-threonine and the GalNAc-serine linkages found in O-linked oligosaccharides in glycoproteins. The amino acid sequence adjacent to glycosylated threonine residues may influence the rate of glycosylation by the pure transferase. For example, the second threonine residue in the sequence, Thr-Thr, appears to be glycosylated about twice as fast as the first and more rapidly than single, isolated threonine residues. However, no unique consensus sequence for glycosylation of threonine residues is evident, and any accessible threonine residue appears to be a potential acceptor substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1517915719,"A new ganglioside antigen, termed Chol-1 alpha-b, recognized by cholinergic neuron-specific antibody, Chol-1 alpha, was isolated from bovine brain ganglioside mixture using Q-Sepharose. The yield was approximately 1.3 mg from 5 g of the total ganglioside. The chemical structure was characterized as a novel ganglioside by means of gas-liquid chromatography, a permethylation study, mild acid hydrolysis, thin layer chromatography-enzyme immunostaining, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The ganglioside has the following unique structure. [formula: see text] When examined by thin layer chromatography immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, this ganglioside has the most intense immunoreactivity with Chol-1 alpha antibody among bovine brain gangliosides. As combined with our previous results (Hirabayashi, Y., Hyogo, A., Nakao, T., Tsuchiya, K., Suzuki, Y., Matsumoto, M., Kon, K., and Ando, S. (1990) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1605151057,"Proline utilization by Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium requires expression of genes putP (encoding a proline transporter) and putA. Genetic data indicate that the PutA protein is both put repressor and a respiratory chain-linked dehydrogenase. We report a redesigned purification procedure as well as the physical characteristics and biological activities of the PutA protein purified from E. coli. The purified protein was homogeneous as determined by electrophoresis performed under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions. Its N-terminal sequence corresponded to that predicted by the DNA sequence. We showed copurification of proline and delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activities. Purified PutA protein bound put DNA in vitro in an electrophoretic band-shift assay and it could be reconstituted to inverted membrane vesicles, yielding proline dehydrogenase activity. The Stokes radius and Svedberg coefficient of the protein were determined to be 7.1 nm and 9.9 S, respectively. These hydrodynamic data revealed that the protein in our preparation was dimeric with a molecular mass of 293 kDa and that it had an irregular shape indicated by the friction factor (f/f0) of 1.6."
https://openalex.org/W2127702556,"Abstract Rapid-scanning stopped-flow (RSSF) UV-visible spectroscopy has been used to investigate the effects of single amino acid mutations in the alpha-subunit of the Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase bienzyme complex on the reactivity at the beta-subunit active site located 25 to 30 A distant. The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor provides a convenient spectroscopic probe to directly monitor catalytic events at the beta-active site. Single substitutions of Phe for Glu at position 49, Leu for Gly at position 51, or Tyr for Asp at position 60 in the alpha-subunit strongly alter the observed steady state and pre-steady state inhibitory effects of the alpha-subunit-specific ligand alpha-glycerophosphate (GP) on the PLP-dependent beta-reaction. However, similar GP-induced allosteric effects on the distribution of covalent intermediates bound at the beta-site that are observed with the wild-type enzyme (Houben, K.F., and Dunn, M.F. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 2421-2429) also are observed for each of the mutant bienzyme complexes. These results support the hypothesis that the preferred pathway of indole from solution into the beta-site is via the alpha-site and the interconnecting tunnel (Dunn, M.F., Aguilar, V., Brzovic, P., Drewe, W.F., Houben, K.F., Leja, C.A., and Roy, M. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8598-8607). Residues alpha E49, alpha G51, and alpha D60 are part of a highly conserved inserted sequence in the alpha/beta-barrel topology of the alpha-subunit. We propose that the GP-induced inhibition of the beta-reaction results, in part, from a ligand-dependent conformational change from an to a structure of the alpha-subunit which involves this region of the alpha-subunit and serves to obstruct the direct access of indole into the tunnel. Our findings suggest that the altered kinetic behavior observed for the alpha-mutants in the presence of GP reflects an impaired ability of the modified bienzyme complex to undergo the conformational transition from the open to the closed form."
https://openalex.org/W1603488046,"Ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides via a radical-mediated mechanism. The enzyme from Escherichia coli consists of the two non-identical proteins, R1 and R2, the latter of which contains the necessary free radical located to a tyrosine residue. The radical scavenger hydroxyurea was found to reduce the tyrosyl radical of R2 in a second-order reaction. The rate constant (0.50 M-1 s-1 at 25 degrees C) for this process was several orders of magnitude lower than the hydroxyurea-dependent reduction of free tyrosyl radicals in solution. This difference probably reflects the fact that the R2 tyrosyl radical is buried in the interior of the protein. Formation of the R1R2 complex changed the susceptibility of the radical to hydroxyurea in a manner that reflects the regulatory state of the holoenzyme. Furthermore, binding of substrate or product to the holoenzyme complex made the R2 radical at least 10 times more susceptible to inactivation by hydroxyurea than it was in the isolated R2 protein. One active site mutation in the R1 protein was shown to affect the sensitivity of the tyrosyl radical of R2 differently than wild type protein R1 does. Our results clearly show that the susceptibility of the tyrosyl radical in R2 to inactivation by hydroxyurea can be used as an efficient probe for the regulatory state of the holoenzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1649026641,"Abstract To test the hypothesis that DNA methylation controls the state of differentiation of a mammalian cell, we transfected the stable mesenchymal line 10T1/2 with an expression vector encoding sequences from the DNA methyltransferase (DNA MeTase) cDNA in the antisense orientation. 10T1/2 cells transfected with the antisense construct (pZ alpha M), but not with the vector alone, exhibit morphological changes, convert into multinucleated tubular cells, and express the skeletal myosin heavy chain protein. The conversion to myogenic phenotype is a late event and is dependent on the number of replication events that the cell has undergone, suggesting that induction of myogenesis is a multistep process. Demethylation of sequences that are not involved in the myogenic process is detected at early passages, while demethylation and expression of the MyoD gene is a late event. This report establishes for the first time that demethylation is a very early event in commitment to myogenic differentiation, while demethylation and expression of MyoD is a late event. We suggest that other genes serve as the initial targets for demethylation and commitment of mesenchymal cells to myogenesis. The cell lines described in this report can serve as an important system for identifying these genes."

The final yields of gangliosides G1, G2, and G3 were 2 mg, 37 mg, and 40 mg per 1.7 kg of the buttermilk powder, respectively. On the basis of immunostaining on high performance thin layer chromatography with specific monoclonal antibodies, mild alkaline treatment, gas-liquid chromatographic analysis, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies, G1 and G2 are characterized as O-acetylated GD3 and G3 as O-acetylated GT3, and the structures of these gangliosides are as follows: [formula: see text] The major fatty acids of these gangliosides were C18:0, C22:0, C23:0, and C24:0, and the long chain base was C18-sphingosine."
https://openalex.org/W1586677715,"We have studied the function of a mutant human insulin receptor in which two COOH-terminal autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1316 and -1322) were replaced by phenylalanine (F/Y COOH-terminal 2 tyrosines (CT2)). In addition, we have also constructed a mutant receptor in which Lys-1018 in the ATP-binding site was changed to arginine (R/K 1018). Both the wild type insulin receptor (HIR) and the mutant receptors were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by stable transfection. Autophosphorylation of solubilized and partially purified F/Y CT2 was decreased by approximately 30% compared with the HIR. Tyrosine kinase activities of F/Y CT2 and HIR toward exogenous substrates were almost equal. When CHO cells transfected with F/Y CT2 (CHO-F/Y CT2) were stimulated with insulin, autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor and the phosphorylation of an endogenous substrate (pp185) in the intact cell were normal compared with cells expressing HIR (CHO-HIR). CHO-F/Y CT2 exhibited the same insulin sensitivity as CHO-HIR with respect to 2-deoxyglucose uptake. However, the dose-response curve of insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation in CHO-F/Y CT2 was shifted to the left (approximately 5-7-fold) compared with that in CHO-HIR. There was no significant difference in insulin-like growth factor 1-stimulated thymidine incorporation between CHO-F/Y CT2 and CHO-HIR. Furthermore, the dose-response curve of insulin-stimulated kinase activity toward myelin basic protein in CHO-F/Y CT2 was also shifted to the left (approximately 5-fold) compared with that in CHO-HIR. Kinase assays in myelin basic protein-containing gels revealed that both species of MAP kinases (M(r) 44,000, 42,000) were more sensitive to activation by insulin in CHO-F/Y CT2 than in CHO-HIR. This observation was confirmed in immune complex kinase assays toward microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) using specific antibodies against mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. R/K 1018 mutant insulin receptors showed an absence of insulin-stimulated kinase activity and CHO cells transfected with R/K 1018 (CHO-R/K 1018) failed to enhance 2-deoxyglucose uptake or thymidine incorporation in response to insulin. In addition, R/K 1018 kinase-defective insulin receptors were unable to mediate insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activation. These data suggest that: 1) tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor is required for activation of insulin-stimulated MAP kinases and 2) phosphorylation of COOH-terminal tyrosine residues may play an inhibitory role in mitogenic signaling through regulation of MAP kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1501441539,"The deficient activity of the human lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM, EC 3.1.4.12), results in the neuronopathic (Type A) and non-neuronopathic (Type B) forms of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD). To investigate the genetic basis of the phenotypic heterogeneity in NPD, the molecular lesions in the ASM gene were determined from three unrelated NPD patients and evaluated by transient expression in COS-1 cells. A Type A NPD patient of Asian Indian ancestry (proband 1) was homoallelic for a T to A transversion in exon 2 of the ASM gene which predicted a premature stop at codon 261 of the ASM polypeptide (designated L261X). In contrast, an unrelated Type A patient of European ancestry (proband 2) was heteroallelic for a two-base (TT) deletion in exon 2 which caused a frame-shift mutation at ASM codon 178 (designated fsL178), leading to a premature stop at codon 190, and a G to A transition in exon 3 which caused a methionine to isoleucine substitution at codon 382 (designated M382I). Transient expression of the fsL178, L261X, and M382I mutations in COS-1 cells demonstrated that these lesions did not produce catalytically active ASM, consistent with the severe neuronopathic Type A NPD phenotype. In contrast, an unrelated Type B patient of European descent (proband 3) was heteroallelic for two missense mutations, a G to A transition in exon 2 which predicted a glycine to arginine substitution at ASM codon 242 (designated G242R), and an A to G transition in exon 3 which resulted in an asparagine to serine substitution at codon 383 (designated N383S). Interestingly, the G242R allele produced ASM activity in COS-1 cells at levels about 40% of that expressed by the normal allele, thereby explaining the mild Type B phenotype of proband 3 and the high residual activity (i.e. approximately 15% of normal) in cultured lymphoblasts. In contrast, the N383S allele did not produce catalytically active enzyme. None of these five ASM mutations was detected in over 60 other unrelated NPD patients analyzed, nor were these mutations found in over 100 normal ASM alleles. Thus, small deletions or nonsense mutations which trunctated the ASM polypeptide, or missense mutations that rendered the enzyme noncatalytic, resulted in Type A NPD disease, whereas a missense mutation that produced a defective enzyme with residual catalytic activity caused the milder nonneuronopathic Type B phenotype. These findings have facilitated genotype/phenotype correlations for this lysosomal storage disease and provided insights into the functional organization of the ASM polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1495389370,"In the accompanying study (Borner, C.B., Guadagno, S. N., and Weinstein, I. B. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12892-12899) we found that R6 embryo fibroblasts express four isoforms of PKC, cPKC alpha, nPKC epsilon, nPKC delta, and nPKC zeta whose subcellular distribution, activation, and down-regulation are differentially regulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that overproduction of an exogenous cPKC beta I isoform in these cells (R6-PKC3) altered the TPA-induced down-regulation of nPKC delta and nPKC epsilon. In this paper we show that transformation of R6 or R6-PKC3 cells with a variety of different oncogenes results in differential alterations in expression of individual PKC isoforms. R6 or R6-PKC3 cells transformed by an activated c-H-ras oncogene displayed a marked increase in the expression of both cPKC alpha and nPKC delta, decreased expression of nPKC epsilon, and no change in the expression of nPKC zeta. These alterations occurred at both the mRNA and protein levels but did not significantly affect the subcellular distribution of any of the four isoforms. Studies using actinomycin D and nuclear run-off assays indicated that the increased expression of cPKC alpha in ras-transformed cells was due to increased de novo transcription rather than increased mRNA stability. Qualitatively similar, but less extensive changes in the expression of the four PKC isoforms were seen in v-fos-transformed R6-PKC3 cells. Decreased expression of nPKC epsilon was also seen in the v-src-transformed R6- and R6-PKC3 lines; however, the cellular level of cPKC beta I appeared to be a limiting factor in mediating the effects of v-src on the increased expression of cPKC alpha and nPKC delta. Interestingly, no major changes in the levels of expression of any of the four PKC isoforms were found when R6 cells were transformed by myc, neu/erb-B2, or mos oncogenes. These results demonstrate that transformation of R6 cells by the oncogenes ras, src, and fos differentially alter the expression of three isoforms of PKC in the same host cell, and they suggest that individual isoforms may play distinct roles in mediating cellular transformation by specific oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1555322236,"Villin is a multidomain protein that severs, caps, and bundles actin filaments. We employed a chemical modification/cleavage strategy to identify residues whose chemical reactivities are reduced when villin is complexed with actin. We found that actin protects 3 methionine residues, Met125, Met379, and Met711 from oxidation by N-chlorosuccinimide. Because Met125 lies within the actin-severing domain of villin (44T), we probed this region for actin binding sites using a series of overlapping peptides each with an additional cysteine residue at their C terminus. Each peptide, as a disulfide-bonded dimer, was examined for actin cross-linking activity by electron microscopy and light scattering. Our results with M3R suggest this region contains an F-actin binding site and are consistent with proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis studies of gelsolin. Single substitution of the basic residues modulated actin severing but not capping activity of 44T. Circular dichroism and protease digestions did not detect alterations in secondary structure or conformational changes in the mutants, although some are cleaved more rapidly, thereby suggesting a change in the packing of the domains. Our results highlight that basic residues comprise part of the F-actin binding site that is involved in the actin severing activity of villin."
https://openalex.org/W1554234258,"A 16-kDa lactose-binding lectin comprises 5% or more of the soluble protein in Xenopus laevis skin. This lectin is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of granular gland cells. In response to stress, the lectin along with a variety of toxic and antibiotic peptides are released onto the skin surface by holocrine secretion. We have purified the lectin, sequenced tryptic peptides using tandem mass spectrometry and Edman degradation, and isolated full-length cDNA using a deduced oligonucleotide. Comparison of the cDNA and peptide sequences revealed expression of at least two isolectins, which differ in sequence at only two or three amino acids. Comparison of cDNA with complementary message by ribonuclease protection confirmed expression in approximately equal abundance of two nearly identical messages. The major soluble lactose-binding lectin expressed in Xenopus muscle is composed of these same isolectins, but at 100-fold lower levels. Similarities and distinctions in sequence and carbohydrate-binding specificity indicate that this lectin is a novel member of a family of soluble lactose-binding lectins expressed in a wide range of vertebrate tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1521890372,"The enzymatic conversion of thyroxine (T4) to 3,5,3-triiodothyronine (T3) by iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase(s) is an obligate step in the physiologic action of thyroid hormones in most extrathyroidal tissues. In the rat liver and kidney, 5'-deiodinase processes having either high Km (micromolar range) or low Km (nanomolar range) values for thyroid hormone substrates have been described. The number of enzymes mediating these reactions, however, remains uncertain and controversial. To examine this question we have compared the 5'-deiodinase activity expressed in membrane preparations of Xenopus laevis oocytes after the injection of either rat liver poly(A)+ RNA or in vitro prepared RNA transcribed using the G21 full-length type I 5'-deiodinase cDNA. In oocytes injected with rat liver poly(A)+ RNA, high Km (i.e. type I) activity was observed when 20 mM dithiothreitol was used as the thiol cofactor, whereas Km values in the nanomolar range were noted with 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, glutathione, or a reconstituted thioredoxin cofactor system. This complex pattern of 5'-deiodinase activity, which mimics that found in homogenates and subcellular fractions of rat liver and kidney, was reproduced exactly in oocytes by the microinjection of G21-derived RNA transcripts. Furthermore, hybrid arrest of translation in oocytes using a partial type I 5'-deiodinase cDNA completely inhibited the expression of both high and low Km activity after the injection of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA. These findings demonstrate that rat liver and kidney contain only a single 5'-deiodinase which manifests either high or low Km activity depending on the reduced thiol cofactor utilized in the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1532008773,"Internalization of the human insulin receptor requires the activation by insulin of the intrinsic kinase of the receptor. However, even in the absence of kinase activation, insulin receptors slowly enter the cells. In the present study, we addressed the question of this insulin-independent pathway of internalization. To that end, we traced insulin receptor internalization with a monoclonal antibody (mAb 83-14) directed against the alpha-subunit of the human insulin receptor. Internalization of this antibody was followed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with either normal (CHO.HIRC2) or kinase-deficient (CHO.A1018) human insulin receptors. The internalization rate of 125I-mAb 83-14 was comparable in CHO cells expressing kinase-active or kinase-inactive receptors and was similar to that observed for 125I-insulin in CHO.A1018 cells. Moreover, in CHO.HIRC2 cells, the internalization of 125I-mAb 83-14 was identical with that of its 125I-Fab fragments. Thus, mAb 83-14 represents an appropriate tool to study the constitutive internalization of the insulin receptor. Internalization of insulin receptors tagged with 125I-mAb 83-14 was unaffected by cytochalasin B, which excluded a macropinocytotic process. By contrast, internalization was sensitive to hypertonia, which abrogates clathrin-coated pits-mediated endocytosis. The implication of clathrin-coated pits in this internalization process was directly demonstrated by quantitative electron microscopic autoradiography, which showed that 125I-mAb 83-14 present on the nonvillous domain of the cell surface preferentially associate with clathrin-coated pits at all time points."
https://openalex.org/W1501266324,"The soluble and membrane-bound forms of the synthetic rat cytochrome b5 gene have been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In order to examine the topology and function of the COOH-terminal membrane binding domain of cytochrome b5, mutants have been constructed, expressed, purified, and partially characterized. Pro-115 is located in the middle of the putative alpha-helical membrane-anchoring domain of cytochrome b5 and has been hypothesized to give rise to either a hairpin-like loop or approximately equal to 26 degrees kink in the helix, depending on whether it exists, respectively, in the cis or trans configuration. The Pro-115----Ala mutant, which is expected to have a straight transmembrane helix, inserted normally into the endoplasmic reticulum and exhibited wild type levels of activity in yeast microsomes and in vitro in the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidation system. Since a hairpin structure does not appear to be essential, it is likely that the membrane binding domain of cytochrome b5 spans the membrane. Characterization of the truncated cytochrome b5 molecule, Pro-115----Stop, lacking 19 amino acids at the COOH terminus indicates that the distal part of the membrane binding domain of cytochrome b5 is necessary for in vivo binding to the endoplasmic reticulum and for functioning with its membrane-associated electron transfer partners. Replacement of Ser-104 to Met-125, the putative membrane-anchoring domain of cytochrome b5, with 22 leucine residues results in a protein which targets to the endoplasmic reticulum but the extent of its reduction is only 50% of that of the wild type in yeast microsomes. In vitro, the polyleucine mutant is unable to support substrate oxidation by cytochrome P-450. The mutation of Ala-131 and Glu-132, amino acids flanking the transmembrane domain, to lysines resulted in a protein with normal membrane topology and function."

https://openalex.org/W1543539965,"Removal of 13 to 15 amino acids from the N terminus of bovine placental lactogen (bPL), which according to the three-dimensional structure of pGH corresponds to a nonhelical part of bPL, did not effect its secondary structure or change the monomer content of the protein preparation. However, it remarkably decreased the binding of the prolactin (PRL) type of receptors on Nb2 cells with subsequent reduction in bioactivity. The binding to the growth hormone (somatogen) receptors either did not change or was increased, resulting in an increase of somatogen receptor-mediated bioactivity. Further truncation (17-18 amino acids) resulted in a decrease of alpha-helical content and loss of binding properties and biological activity mediated through interaction of the analogues with both somatogen (3T3-F442A cells) and lactogen (PRL) receptors (NB2-11C cells). Truncation of 19-27 amino acids caused additional loss in activity, without further change in the secondary structure. Replacement of Leu28 by a more hydrophobic Phe has only minor, if any, effect on the bioactivity of bPL. Occasional point mutations due to polymerase chain reaction errors in several analogues did not seem to have any major effect on the hormone properties. It can thus be suggested that the N-terminal part of the nonhelical portion of bPL, which corresponds to the portion of the molecule that does not exist in growth hormones, is required for efficient binding to the lactogen (PRL) but not to the somatogen or unique bPL receptors. Removal of the N-terminal part of pBL changed the specificity of bPL by decreasing its PRL receptor-mediated activities and increasing its somatogen receptor-mediated activities."
https://openalex.org/W1527960728,"We have examined the mechanism of regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase by 24(S),25-oxidolanosterol, a C30-sterol naturally occurring in mammalian tissues. In the absence of enzymatic demethylation to the C27-sterol, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, oxidolanosterol is shown to be a post-transcriptional regulator of reductase synthesis in both primary rat hepatocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Under these conditions, oxidolanosterol also increases the rate of degradation of reductase protein in these cells. When demethylation is not inhibited, oxidolanosterol treatment produces transcriptional regulation of sterol-sensitive genes in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In contrast to previous findings with the oxygenated C27-sterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, oxidolanosterol can act as a post-transcriptional regulator in cells starved for mevalonate. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidolanosterol down-regulates sterol synthesis in a fashion mechanistically distinct from that of C27-sterols."
https://openalex.org/W1535780453,"We have determined that greater than or equal to 80% of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides on the glycosylated form of mouse adrenocorticotropin (15-kDa adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)) bear one or more branches terminating with the sequence SO4-4GalNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,2Man alpha (S4GGnM). Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor of ACTH, is the first example of a glycoprotein that is not a member of the glycoprotein hormone family to bear such sulfated structures. Like lutropin and thyrotropin, 15-kDa ACTH bears dibranched oligosaccharides terminating with SO4-4-GalNAc; however, at least half of the oligosaccharides on 15-kDa ACTH terminating with SO4-4-GalNAc consist of more highly branched structures that have not previously been described. Both the GalNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,2Man-4-sulfotransferase and the glycoprotein hormone-specific GalNAc-transferase are expressed in the corticotroph-derived AtT-20 cell line. A tripeptide recognition sequence, Pro-Val-Lys, similar to the Pro-Leu-Arg sequence required for recognition of glycoprotein hormone alpha- and beta-subunits by the glycoprotein hormone-specific GalNAc-transferase, is present 8 residues amino-terminal to the glycosylated Asn of 15-kDa ACTH. Thus, POMC has the features expected for specific addition of the S4GGnM sequence to its oligosaccharides. The recent discovery of a receptor in hepatic endothelial cells that recognizes oligosaccharides terminating with S4GGnM suggests these sulfated oligosaccharides will regulate the circulatory half-life of glycosylated POMC cleavage products."
https://openalex.org/W1489410567,"Abstract meta-Vinculin and vinculin are closely related proteins that are cytoplasmic components of microfilament-associated cell junctions. This report describes the structural relationship between these two proteins and the genetic basis for tissue-specific expression of meta-vinculin. Analysis of genomic DNA coding for amino acids 676-1066 of vinculin revealed 9 exons spanning an 11.7-kilobase pair region of the genome. In the 4 kilobase pairs of intervening sequence that separates vinculin exons E896-E915 and E916-E984, there is an open reading frame that predicts a sequence homologous to the 68-amino acid peptide specific to porcine meta-vinculin (Gimona, M., Small, J. V., Moeremans, M., Van Damme, J., Puype, M., and Van-dekerckhove, J. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 2329-2334). Analysis of the corresponding cDNA established that chicken meta-vinculin contains a 69-amino acid insertion between residues 915 and 916 of vinculin and that there are no other amino acid sequence differences between chicken vinculin and meta-vinculin. Muscle-specific expression of meta-vinculin occurs by alternative splicing of a transcript produced from a single gene because: all 20 genomic isolates that contain the 3' vinculin exons, also contain the meta-vinculin-specific exon; Southern blots performed at high stringency with exon-specific probes indicate the presence of a single gene; and the 3'-untranslated sequences of vinculin and meta-vinculin cDNAs are identical."
https://openalex.org/W1511089543,"We have investigated the role of different domains of a salivary basic proline-rich protein in intracellular transport and sorting of proline-rich proteins to the secretory granules. We have cloned a full-length cDNA of a basic proline-rich protein from the rat parotid and expressed it in AtT-20 cells. It was correctly sorted into secretory granules as shown by EM immunolocalization and by its presence in 8-bromocyclic AMP-stimulated secretion. Deletion of the N-terminal thirteen amino acid domain upstream from the proline-rich domain eliminated storage whereas deletion of the C-terminal 20-amino acid domain downstream from the proline-rich domain had no effect. Intracellular transport of full-length and mutant proline-rich proteins was unusually slow due to slow exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the rate of transport increased with increasing level of expression for the full-length protein and the C-terminal deletion mutant. In contrast, the rate of transport of the N-terminal deletion mutant was independent of the level of expression. These results imply that the N-terminal domain is necessary for both storage and efficient intracellular transport. Moreover, interactions (self-aggregation?) that mediate sorting may begin as early as the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2146867563,"The human renin-binding protein (RnBP) gene was isolated from a human placental genomic library and characterized. The gene spans about 10 kilobases and consists of 11 exons separated by 10 introns. The 5'-flanking region and the exon-intron boundaries were sequenced. Residue G* in 5'-CGAG*TGG-3' was identified as the major transcription initiation site, and GC boxes were found in the vicinity of the cap site. No typical TATA or CCAAT box exists in the 5'-flanking region. The hydrophobic domain followed by a leucine-zipper motif in RnBP is encoded by the sixth exon. A fragment of the human RnBP gene (nucleotides -739 to +244) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was transfected into human Wilms' tumor G401 and mouse L929 cells. The expression of this chimeric gene in G401 cells was 4-fold higher than that in L929 cells, the tissue-specific regulation of RnBP gene expression thus being suggested. The promoter for the RnBP gene was shown to be localized in nucleotides -35 to +244 on assaying of the promoter activity using deletion mutants of the chimeric constructs. The RnBP gene was found to be located in human chromosome X by means of polymerase chain reaction of hybrid DNAs from human and hamster somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1512843270,"The cDNA for the alpha-isoenzyme from rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) liver was cloned and expressed in yeast. The alpha-isoenzymes of human and monkey liver alcohol dehydrogenase differ from the other human and horse liver enzymes in having Met57, Ala93, and Val116 instead of Leu57, Phe93, and Leu116 in the substrate binding pocket and Gly47 instead of Arg47 near the pyrophosphate moiety of the coenzyme. The effects of these differences on the kinetic mechanism, substrate specificity, and coenzyme binding were studied with the purified, recombinant monkey alpha-isoenzyme (MmADH alpha) and mutated enzymes with Gly47 substituted with His or Arg. The mechanism appears to be random for the binding of NAD+ and ethanol and ordered for NADH and acetaldehyde, with formation of a dead-end enzyme-NADH-ethanol complex. MmADH alpha reacts 130-fold slower (V/K) with ethanol and 3-25-fold slower with 2-methyl alcohols but 20-fold faster with cyclohexanol, as compared with horse (Equus caballus) liver EE isoenzyme (EqADH). MmADH alpha is stereoselective for the R isomer of 2-butanol, whereas EqADH favors the S isomer. Both enzymes have comparable reactivity with larger primary alcohols. MmADH alpha is more reactive with secondary alcohols and has highest activity with cyclohexanol. However, it does not react with steroids such as 5 beta-androstane-17 beta-ol-3-one. Molecular modeling suggests that the differences between MmADH alpha and EqADH are a result of the substitution of Ala for Phe93 and Thr for Ser48. MmADH alpha binds NAD+ most rapidly when a group with a pK of 7.4 is unprotonated, implicating His51 in this reaction. The G47R substitution decreased the dissociation constants for NAD+ and NADH and turnover numbers only about 2-fold, whereas the G47H substitution increased dissociation constants 7-14-fold and turnover numbers 4-fold. A basic residue at position 47 is not crucial for activity, as multiple interactions determine coenzyme affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1591479113,"A system has been developed for the import in vitro of precursor proteins into Euglena chloroplasts, which have three envelope membranes. Preparation of functional chloroplasts with intact envelope membranes has been optimized. Import of the precursor (50 kDa) for the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), and processing to the mature size (40 kDa), occurred at 25 degrees C in the light and the presence of ATP, with an estimated efficiency of 62%. Pretreatment of the chloroplasts with proteases abolished this import, suggesting the involvement of specific protein receptors. The presequence of PBGD was found to be cleaved by Escherichia coli leader peptidase to an intermediate form (46 kDa). A construct in which the first 30 residues of the presequence (presumed to be the region removed by leader peptidase) had been deleted was no longer imported. Neither prePBGD nor the truncated precursor were imported into pea chloroplasts, although both bound to the pea chloroplast envelope. Conversely, a chimeric construct, in which the mature PBGD protein was fused downstream of the transit peptide for pea ferredoxin-NADP reductase, was efficiently imported into pea chloroplasts and processed to the mature size. However, this was not imported into Euglena chloroplasts, although again it bound to them. These results provide preliminary evidence for the possibility of two functional domains within the Euglena PBGD presequence. The implications of these findings with respect to the evolution of Euglena chloroplasts are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1594326146,"The role of Cys residues in the site-specific DNA binding activity of the nuclear factor I (NFI) family of proteins was assessed by chemical modification and site-specific mutagenesis. Treatment with the thio-specific reagent N-ethylmaleimide abolished site-specific DNA binding of all forms of NFI present in HeLa nuclear extracts. Preincubation of cell extracts with an oligonucleotide containing an NFI-binding site provided partial protection of NFI from N-ethylmaleimide inactivation. Mutations were made in the cDNA encoding a truncated form of the NFI-C/CAAT box transcription factor-1 protein, converting each of the five Cys residues in the DNA-binding domain of the protein into Ser residues. NFI-C proteins containing mutations in any of four conserved Cys residues, expressed in Escherichia coli or in vitro, did not bind to DNA. NFI-C with a mutation in a nonconserved Cys residue had normal DNA binding activity. Both this active mutant and wild-type NFI-C protein were inactivated by modification of their sulfhydryl residues with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and preincubation with an oligonucleotide containing an NFI-binding site gave partial protection against inactivation. After modification with DTNB, DNA binding activity was partially restored by subsequent incubation with dithiothreitol, indicating that inactivation of NFI by DTNB was reversible. These studies indicate an essential role for free sulfhydryl residues in NFI-DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1589528809,"Site-specific mutants of human myoglobin (Mb) have been prepared, in which Leu29 (B10) is replaced by Ala(L29A) or Ile(L29I), in order to examine the influence of this highly conserved residue in the hydrophobic clusters of the heme distal site on the heme environmental structure and ligand binding properties of Mb. Structural characterizations of these recombinant Mbs are studied by electronic absorption, infrared (IR), one- and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, and ligand-binding kinetics by laser photolysis measurements under ambient and high pressures (up to 2000 bar). Multiple split carbon monoxide (CO) stretch bands in the IR spectra of mutant Mbs exhibit a relative decrease of the 1945 cm-1 band (approximately 50%) which is associated with an upright binding geometry of CO, accompanied by an increase of the tilted CO conformer at 1932 cm-1. On the basis of these results, replacement of Leu29(B10) by Ala or Ile appears to allow bound CO to rotate from a conformation pointing toward the beta meso carbon of the heme group to the one pointing toward the alpha meso carbon atom, presumably filling the space left by removal of the delta 2 carbon atom of Leu29(B10). These substitutions cause the rate constants for CO and O2 association to decrease almost 3-5-fold. Present results show that CO and O2 bindings to the heme iron of Mb are controlled by Leu29(B10) by influencing the structure of close vicinity of the heme and the geometry of iron-bound ligand.

No effect on the smaller protein R2 was observed. The effect of the degradation product was about 30 times lower than that of caracemide itself. The caracemide inactivation of R1 is irreversible, with an apparent second-order rate constant of 150 M-1 s-1. The R1R2 holoenzyme was approximately 30 times more sensitive to caracemide inactivation than the isolated R1 protein. The ribonucleotide reductase substrates were potent competitors of the caracemide inhibition, with a Kdiss for GDP binding to R1 of 80 microM. The reducing agent dithiothreitol was also found to be a potent competitor of caracemide inactivation. These results indicate that caracemide inactivates R1 by covalent modification at the substrate-binding site. By analogy with the known interaction between caracemide and acetylcholinesterase or choline acetyltransferase, we propose that the modification of R1 occurs at an activated cysteine or serine residue in the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1552835753,"The eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-5 mediates hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex in the absence of 60 S ribosomal subunits. The eIF-2.GDP formed under these conditions is released from the 40 S ribosomal subunit while initiator Met-tRNA(f) remains bound. The released eIF-2.GDP can participate in an eIF-2B-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange reaction to reform the Met-tRNA(f).eIF-2.GTP ternary complex. In contrast, when 60 S ribosomal subunits were also present in an eIF-5-catalyzed reaction, the eIF-2.GDP produced remained bound to the 60 S ribosomal subunit of the 80 S initiation complex. When such an 80 S initiation complex, containing bound eIF-2.GDP, was incubated with GTP and eIF-2B, GDP was released. However, eIF-2 still remained bound to the ribosomes and was unable to form a Met-tRNA(f)l.eIF-2.GTP ternary complex. In contrast, when 60 S ribosomal subunits were preincubated with either free eIF-2 or with eIF-2.eIF-2B complex and then added to a reaction containing both the 40 S initiation complex and eIF-5, the eIF-2.GDP produced did not bind to the 60 S ribosomal subunits but was released from the ribosomes. Thus, the 80 S initiation complex formed under these conditions did not contain bound eIF-2.GDP. Under similar experimental conditions, preincubation of 60 S ribosomal subunits with purified eIF-2B (free of eIF-2) failed to cause release of eIF-2.GDP from the ribosomal initiation complex. These results suggest that 60 S ribosome-bound eIF-2.GDP does not act as a direct substrate for eIF-2B-mediated release of eIF-2 from ribosomes. Rather, the affinity of 60 S ribosomal subunits for either eIF-2, or the eIF-2 moiety of the eIF-2.eIF-2B complex, prevents association of 60 S ribosomal subunits with eIF-2.GDP formed in the initiation reaction. This ensures release of eIF-2 from ribosomes following hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1581285304,"L-Histidine labeled with deuterium at the C-5' position of the imidazole ring, L-[5'-2H]histidine (His-5'-D), was used as a probe for investigating a stepwise reversible mechanism via a carbanion intermediate in the elimination of ammonia catalyzed by histidine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.3). The labeled L-histidine (His-5'-D) (2.45 mM) was incubated with histidine ammonia-lyase (200 units) from Pseudomonas fluorescens at pH 7.0 or 9.0 at 25.0 degrees C for 24 h. The time course of the reaction was examined to determine the rates of enzyme-catalyzed hydrogen exchange at C-5' of L-histidine and urocanic acid. The finding of the enzyme-catalyzed hydrogen exchange at C-5' of both L-histidine and urocanic acid in the presence of L-histidine provided a rational explanation for a stepwise reversible mechanism via a carbanion intermediate in the elimination reaction. The rate of increase in the concentration of urocanic acid exchanged with hydrogen (UA-5'-H) did not depend on the formation rate of urocanic acid and UA-5'-H was continuously formed at a constant rate (25.6 microM/h) even after the completion of urocanic acid formation. These observations suggested the presence of the reversible reaction of urocanic acid and a carbanion intermediate. Since there was only a minor contribution for the formation of UA-5'-H from L-histidine exchanged with solvent hydrogen (His-5'-H), the main pathway in the enzymatic reaction of His-5'-D must be the formation of UA-5'-D via a carbanion intermediate (carbanion-D). Regeneration of the carbanion-D from UA-5'-D by its reverse reaction and subsequent hydrogen incorporation at C-5' would contribute to a large extent for the formation of UA-5'-H. The stability of carbanion was also demonstrated to be approximately three times higher at pH 7.0 than at pH 9.0."
https://openalex.org/W1559160303,"Vacuole formation around the Golgi and immunotoxin enhancement induced by low doses of the ionophore monensin were inhibited by 50% human plasma (final concentration), whereas the lysosomal pH increase remained unaffected. Immunotoxin enhancement by the Ca2+ antagonist perhexiline was also inhibited by plasma. The inhibiting factor was present in different species and highly concentration-dependent. After purification on DEAE- and CM-Sepharose it showed a heterogeneous distribution between 45 and 50 kDa, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, an extreme isoelectric point near 3.5, and binding to wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. Maximum inhibition was found in the lower molecular mass fraction of 45 kDa. The 50-kDa fraction, although showing immunological identity reactions, remained almost inactive. The simultaneous inhibition of morphological alterations and the enhancement of immunotoxin activity by the highly enriched protein provides a first direct link between both events. Apart from a role of this serum glycoprotein on in vivo inhibition of immunotoxin enhancement, its ability to maintain normal intracellular trafficking in the presence of blocking agents, such as monensin and perhexiline, suggests a more fundamental role in the regulation of these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1562358130,"Gyrate atrophy (GA) is an autosomal recessive chorioretinal degenerative disease of the eye caused by an inborn defect of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT). We have described previously a GA patient with a 5.0-kilobase pair truncated EcoRI OAT gene fragment and the absence of OAT mRNA on Northern blot analysis. Cloning and sequencing analysis of the truncated gene fragment revealed a 1,072-base pair (bp) deletion including the entire exon 6, starting in intron 5, 172 bp upstream of exon 6 and ending in intron 6, 772 bp downstream of exon 6. A short direct repeat sequence (AGGAGC), resembling the sequence shown to cause DNA polymerase alpha to pause, and sequences capable of forming hairpin loops were both present at the 5‘ and 3‘ break-points of the deletion. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of the patient's RNA with OAT primers yielded DNA fragments of two different sizes, consistent with a low level expression of OAT mRNA. Direct sequencing of the smaller fragment demonstrated the complete absence of exon 6 sequence in the mRNA predicted from the deletion, causing a reading frame shift which results in a premature termination codon at position 192. The mutation in the other allele has been demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct sequencing also to be a premature termination codon in exon 6. The absence of detectable OAT mRNA in this patient is consistent with these premature termination mutations because they have been shown to decrease the level of mRNA, especially if present early in the coding sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1518640997,"Abstract In this paper, we report the cloning and analysis of a cDNA encoding a protein of M(r) congruent to 47,000 (p47), which is localized to the nucleus of rat hepatocytes. The cDNA showed 37% overall sequence identity with a mouse translation initiation factor, eIF-4A, which belongs to a family of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. We raised polyclonal antibodies against the fusion protein and by indirect immunofluorescence on primary cultures of hepatocytes have demonstrated that p47 is located in the nucleus. Although only approximately 27% of hepatocytes showed this nuclear staining, most of the nuclei in proliferating transformed cell lines such as 3T3, PtK-1, and Hela were fluorescently labeled. Studies on serum-starved cells in culture indicated that p47 was expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Northern analyses demonstrated that the levels of p47 mRNA were high in fetal liver and dropped significantly after birth to low levels in adult liver. Our data suggest that p47 is developmentally regulated in rat liver at the mRNA level."
https://openalex.org/W1516683798,"Metal ion-induced conformational changes in Serratia protease which contains one zinc ion per molecule were investigated by the small-angle x-ray scattering method. The molecule is an elongated ellipsoid of approximately 110 x 40 x 40 A with a large cleft in its central region. Comparisons of the native (zinc-enzyme) with the zinc-free (apoenzyme) enzyme and with the zinc-replated metalloenzyme show small but significant differences in their radii of gyration, maximum particle dimensions, and intraparticle pair-distance distributions. The radius of gyration and maximum particle dimension of the native enzyme are almost the same as those of the cobalt-enzyme but are shorter and longer, respectively, than those of the apo- and cadmium-enzymes. Simulation analysis based on the intraparticle pair-distribution function showed that these modified enzymes are comparable with the native enzyme in overall structure, and, except for the cobalt-enzyme, differ in cleft size. The residual enzymatic activity of the cobalt-enzyme is the same as that of the native enzyme, but the apo- and cadmium-enzymes have considerably less activity. The size of the cleft therefore is strictly controlled to ensure optimal enzyme activity, and the position and coordination behavior of the zinc ion in the cleft appears to be essential both for biological functioning and for the maintenance of the gross tertiary structure."
