https://openalex.org/W2002569347,"The number of estrogen binding sites in uterine cytoplasm on a per cell basis reaches a maximum by day 10 of life in both intact and castrate female rats. After this peak is reached, the number of binding sites per cell decreases, and the ratio remains constant until days 22 to 23 of life. Thus, the ontogeny of the estrogen binding protein is not dependent upon estrogen from the ovary and is probably an autonomous property of uterine cells. Sedimentation values and dissociation constants of the protein when the animals are 5 to 10 days of age are similar to those of the 22-day-old animal, indicating that the same protein is present throughout postnatal development."

This all-liquid separation technique is based on the partitioning of solute between a steady stream of droplets of moving phase and a column of surrounding stationary liquid phase. Milligram quantities of dinitrophenyl (DNP) amino acids were separated with an efficiency comparable to that of gas chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W1987403748,"At the neuromuscular junctions between the motor giant axon and fast flexor muscle fibers in crayfish, stimulation at frequencies of one per minute produces a large decline in the amplitude of excitatory junctional potentials. Recovery (dishabituation) can be brought about by increases in stimulus frequency, which trigger a potentiation process; at still higher frequencies, a second form of depression intervenes. The last process appears to be due to depletion of transmitter; the first probably depends instead upon electrical changes in presynaptic terminals. Because of the interactions between the three processes, the junctions display the properties of habituation and dishabituation usually associated with complex central nervous networks."

https://openalex.org/W1679932853,"The natural history of the fungus-growing ants provides a spectacular example of a symbiotic association of two very different types of organisms. An anthropomorphic description is difficult to resist. The ants are efficient and industrious farmers. Their single crop is a fungus, grown on a substrate of leaves in carefully fertilized, welltended gardens. Virtually every facet of the ants' behavior and life cycle has been shaped by their association with the fungus they culture. A characteristic feature of the ants' gardening technique is the application of their fecal material to the garden and to substrate being prepared for incorporation into the garden. We have established the biochemical significance of this behavior. The fecal material contains proteolytic enzymes which compensate for a deficiency of such enzymes in the fungus. In addition, the nitrogenous components in the fecal material facilitate the initial growth of the fungus. In biochemical terms, then, one can say that the ants contribute their enzymatic apparatus to degrade protein and the fungus contributes its enzymatic apparatus to degrade cellulose. As in the case of so many other natural symbiotic and parasitic associations, the basis is an integration of complementary metabolic capabilities and deficiencies."

https://openalex.org/W2080670554,"Using radioactive tags, we recorded movements of salamanders (Plethodon jordani) in their home areas and during homing. Males occupied home areas about three times larger than those of females and made occasional excursions into outlying regions. Homing after 22-to 60-meter displacements was direct and rapid, once initiated. Course headings at 1 meter from release were random; those at 2 meters and more were home-oriented. Males initiated homing movements sooner than females, although both sexes traveled at similar rates. Increased incidence of climbing on vegetation after displacement suggests olfactory mechanisms of orientation. These observations give direct evidence of homing orientation in caudate amphibians."

The trachea was considerably compressed but not fully collapsed at the highest pressures. No measurable change in the size of the bronchioles and smaller bronchi was observed. Measurements of total lung volume obtained simultaneously showed that the seals consistently dived with a small volume."

https://openalex.org/W2000551064,The variable regions of the light and heavy chains on the same macroglobulin (immunoglobulin M) molecule are no more related in amino acid sequence than are the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of different immunoglobulin molecules. Subgroups of μ chains are similar in their variable sequence to subgroups of γ chains.

https://openalex.org/W2072931659,Specificity of sex pheromones maintains breeding isolation among three closely related species of spruce-infesting Ips. Hybrids produced in the laboratory were intermediate to the parent species in both attractiveness and response. Pheromones and pheromone receptor types in the hybrids are probably mixtures of those of the parent species.

This may indicate the existence of a neural mechanism which conveys the information ""in back of."""
https://openalex.org/W2019822771,"Two kinds of phenotypic expression in purine biosynthesis result from recessive mutation to ade12 in baker's yeast. The mutants are adenine-specific, blocked in the conversion of inosine 5′-phosphate to adenylosuccinic acid; their response to inhibition of pathway activity by adenine is considerably reduced. Allelic partial reversions can restore prototrophy without correcting the regulatory defect imparted by the primary mutation. The separation of the two properties of the locus by allelic mutation supports the hypothesis that the locus specifies a protein of two independent functions, enzymatic and regulatory."

https://openalex.org/W1610682703,"Through exponential increase in population, accompanied by rapid industrial and agricultural expansion, we have reached the point where decisions involving the use of natural resources are much more important and also much more difficult than they were even 10 years ago. The same conditions that make decisions more urgent make them more time-consuming. The Cayuga Lake case illustrates many aspects of a present-day resource management controversy."
https://openalex.org/W1992078752,Macromolecules of the water-soluble complex of bacteriochlorophyll protein can assemble in vitro to form fully developed spherulites composed of radiating microtubules. The changes that occur in the pattern of long-range order during the growth of these structures are typical of the development of the spherulitic crystal habit in numerous other materials of nonbiological origin.
https://openalex.org/W2001350302,"A method has been developed for continuous control of the vacuolar composition of the giant internodal cells of the alga Nitella. During perfusion of the vacuole, cyclosis and spontaneous action potentials were evident, while the membrane potential and resistance were 86 and 58 percent of normal, respectively. The membrane system remained intact and functional during perfusion."

Where the paper is marked, a raised-line imprint appears on the same side of the paper as that used for writing. This imprint may be both felt and seen. Newly blinded and partially sighted persons are able to read ordinary Arabic letters and numerals after a few trials."

https://openalex.org/W1987999334,Operational assumptions are made concerning the preferences of a decision maker. Functional forms of multiattribute utility functions that satisfy these assumptions are stated. These forms provide operational methods for assessing preferences over multiattribute consequences and have a wide range of practical application.

https://openalex.org/W2022094502,"The mass of information available about effects of chemical substances (drugs) on behavioral, biochemical, and physiological systems of living organisms is so extensive as to defy traditional methods of analysis. A procedure that provides automated, computerized searches for patterns among these effects has been developed and has been applied to a data base constructed of medical and chemical information from The Merck Index. One promising result is the development of new hypotheses about mechanisms of drug action."
