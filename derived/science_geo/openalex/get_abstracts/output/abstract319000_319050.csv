https://openalex.org/W2004111972,"An organelle approximately 0.5 to 1.5 microns in diameter, limited by a single membrane, occurs abundantly in the chlorophyllous cells of leaves of several dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. Its finely granular matrix frequently contains crystalline, fibrous, or amorphous inclusions. It is frequently appressed to a chloroplast or squeezed between chloroplasts so that its limiting membrane is in extensive contact with the outer membranes of the chloroplast envelopes. The organelle is probably identical with recently isolated leaf particles that contain enzymes involved in the metabolism of glycolate, a chloroplast product; it is interpreted as a form of plant microbody."

https://openalex.org/W2002987566,De novo production of gas vacuoles can be induced in the blue-green alga Nostoc muscorum by transferring the cells from a defined medium to distilled water. The unusual ultrastructure of the gas vacuole membranes permits their easy recognition when specimens are prepared for electron microscopy by freeze-etching. The youngest gas vacuoles are biconical organelles; 48 hours after induction the gas vacuoles reach their maximum observed length when they are cylinders (1.5 by 0.1 μ) with cornical ends.
https://openalex.org/W1978413361,"Examination of ova and parasites from coprolites of probable human origin revealed eggs of the phylum Acanthocephala. Specimens were gathered from Danger Cave in Utah, an area heavily populatd with definitive rodent hosts for the Acanthocephala species Moniliformis clarki. It is postulated that prehistoric man developed Acanthocephala infection by ingesting the arthropod intermediate host, or that he was a victim of false parasitism by ingesting the whole rodent."

https://openalex.org/W2035290648,An antheridium-inducing hormone (antheridiogen) derived from the fern species Onoclea sensibilis (Polypodiaceae) is chromatographically distinct from the native antheridiogen of Pteridium aquilinum (Polypodiaceae). It also differs from the native antheridiogens of Lygodium japonicum and Anemia phyllitidis (Schizaeaceae).
https://openalex.org/W1994542725,"The high temperatures and chemical composition, as determined by space probe and terrestrial observation, suggest that the present atmosphere of Venus has formed by chemical interaction with the lithosphere. Although the precise reactions have not been identified, good theoretical approximations to the molecular abundance may be obtained from reactions applicable to terrestrial rocks. The high temperatures and chemical reactivity create conditions on Venus which are fundamentally different from those on the cooler terrestrial planets where the attainment of equilibrium is prevented by kinetic barriers."

https://openalex.org/W2037818658,The period of optical pulsations from NP 0532 has been determined to within 3 nanoseconds on three different nights. The time rate of change of the period (dP/dt)(p) was 36.17 x 10(-9) second per day. The pulse shape was highly asymmetrical with strong indications of structure. The ratio of the amplitude of the main pulse to that of the interpulse varied with time. No evidence was found for photon coincidences in the pulse on a time scale shorter than 2 microseconds.

https://openalex.org/W2023968650,Activation energies of 1.47 to 2.94 electron volts were obtained in egg white. These values are too large to be consistent with the large observed currents if one uses a semiconductor model and indicate that the standard semiconductor model is inappropriate for this biological material.
