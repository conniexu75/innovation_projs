https://openalex.org/W2063340279,"The production of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere during each of the solar proton events of November 1960, September 1966, and August 1972 is calculated to have been comparable to or larger than the total average annual production of NO by the action of galactic cosmic rays. It is therefore very important to consider the effect of solar proton events on the temporal and spatial distribution of ozone in the stratosphere. A study of ozone distribution after such events may be particularly important for validating photochemical-diffusion models."
https://openalex.org/W2039839920,"If man-made dust is unimportant as a major cause of climatic change, then a strong case can be made that the present cooling trend will, within a decade or so, give way to a pronounced warming induced by carbon dioxide. By analogy with similar events in the past, the natural climatic cooling which, since 1940, has more than compensated for the carbon dioxide effect, will soon bottom out. Once this happens, the exponential rise in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content will tend to become a significant factor and by early in the next century will have driven the mean planetary temperature beyond the limits experienced during the last 1000 years."
https://openalex.org/W2017228399,"Nectar, which fluoresces in the visible and absorbs in the ultraviolet spectrum when irradiated by ultraviolet light, occurs in many bee-pollinated plants. It is suggested that these characteristics function as direct visual cues by which bees can evaluate the quantities of nectar available. Thus, they assume an important role in pollination of the flowers and foraging efficiency of bees."
https://openalex.org/W2112657777,"A study of the coexistence of sparrows in grassland and woodland habitats of the Research Ranch in southeastern Arizona supports the predictability of current community theory. For each of the habitats studied, the production of seeds and the abundance of seed-eating, winter-resident sparrows were measured. The theory correctly predicts the number of species supported in each of the habitats. In both cases for which the prediction is that only one species could be supported, the theory correctly predicts which species should be present."
https://openalex.org/W1987909588,A comparison of the free hydrogen ion concentration and the total hydrogen ion concentration of rain samples shows that rain is a weak acid. The weak acid nature of rain casts doubt on the concepts that the acidity of rain is increasing and that these increases are due to strong acids such as sulfuric acid.
https://openalex.org/W2003675301,"Trace element analyses on turquoise from 24 mines in the southwestern United States indicate that the turquoise artifacts from Snaketown site in south-central Arizona came from the Himalaya mine near Halloron Springs, California. The correlation of artifact and mine turquoise in the Southwest is a means of determining prehistoric exchange patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2050803344,"A test of the ""primary perception"" hypothesis proposed by Backster in 1968 was made by recording electrical activity from the leaves of Philodendra scandentia while randomly ejecting the contents of micropipettes filled with brine shrimp or distilled water into boiling water. Test conditions conformed to those published by Backster or communicated in personal exchanges. Data were analysed from five experiments, in each of which recordings were made from four plants in the presence of three brine shrimp killings and two control water ejections. Inspection of the data and analysis by two statistical methods revealed no relationship between brine shrimp killing and electrical ""responsiveness"" of philodendron."

https://openalex.org/W2092445744,Examination of the postshot cores from the portion of the Tatum Salt Dome that had been subjected to a nuclear explosion (Salmon Event) has indicated evidence for the high-pressure phase transformation of anhydrite. This evidence consists of distinctly different optical domains within the shocked anhydrite. Evidence for the transition exists out to approximately 1.5 cavity radii. Excellent agreement exists between experimental work and the theoretical calculations of the predicted pressure profile.
