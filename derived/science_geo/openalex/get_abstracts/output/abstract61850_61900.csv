https://openalex.org/W1863678882,"Abstract A method is described for the enzymatic synthesis of 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate labeled with 32P at the α position (AMP-PNP-α-32P), an analogue of ATP containing nitrogen substituted for oxygen between the terminal phosphates. The nucleotide is only slowly hydrolyzed during incubation with rat liver plasma membranes and is a substrate for adenyl cyclase in these membranes. In the presence of 0.2 mm AMP-PNP, glucagon and fluoride ion stimulate adenyl cyclase activity; linear rates are maintained for at least 10 min of incubation at 30°. GTP enhanced the initial rate of basal and glucagon-stimulated adenyl cyclase activity. Reduction in concentration of Mg++ in the assay medium or incubation of liver membranes for 5 min at 30° prior to addition of glucagon results in loss of response of adenyl cyclase to glucagon and in reduction in the effects of GTP on basal activity. Under these conditions GTP, GDP, or GMP-PCP are required for glucagon stimulation of the enzyme even though the specific binding sites for glucagon are saturated with hormone; as little as 10 nm GTP or GDP is required. UTP and CTP exert smaller effects than the guanyl nucleotides and act only at concentrations higher than 0.1 mm. The guanyl nucleotides inhibited the response of adenyl cyclase to fluoride ion (10 mm) over the same concentration range over which they stimulate the response of the enzyme to glucagon. This action of the nucleotides is observed in plasma membranes treated with phospholipase A under conditions that result in loss of glucagon binding and of hormonal response. It is concluded that guanyl nucleotides play a specific and obligatory role in the activation of adenyl cyclase by glucagon. The nucleotides bind at sites, distinct from the glucagon binding sites, that appear to regulate both the response of adenyl cyclase to glucagon, and, possibly by a related mechanism, the actions of fluoride ion on this system."

The molecular weights of the catalytic and regulatory polypeptide chains of aspartate transcarbamylase were determined to be 33,500 and 17,000, respectively. The results of three empirical methods are in good agreement with those obtained by sedimentation equilibrium in guanidine-hydrochloride or derived from the intrinsic viscosity and the sedimentation coefficient measured in the same solvent. For the regulatory chain, all values obtained are in the range of 17,000, in agreement with the amino acid sequence (Weber, K., Nature, 218, 1116 (1968)). 2. The molecular weights of the native enzyme and the catalytic subunit were redetermined. The two proteins have masses of 300,000 and 100,000 daltons and show no association-dissociation equilibrium. From the molecular weights of the catalytic subunit and its polypeptide chain, we conclude that this subunit is a trimer. 3. Three independent techniques indicate that the catalytic and the regulatory polypeptide chains are present in equal numbers. This result, in combination with the molecular weights of these chains, indicates that the enzyme molecule contains six catalytic and six regulatory polypeptide chains which are held together solely by noncovalent bonds. 4. Renaturation of aspartate transcarbamylase and the catalytic subunit was achieved from guanidine hydrochloride or dodecyl sulfate solutions. The reactivated native enzyme and catalytic subunit are indistinguishable from their untreated counterparts. A subunit identical in every respect with catalytic subunit isolated after p-hydroxymercuri-benzoate dissociation can also be obtained by heat treatment of the native enzyme. From these results it can be concluded that the catalytic subunit is preserved as a trimer in native aspartate transcarbamylase. A three dimensional arrangement of the enzyme with a D3 symmetry is proposed. 5. The determination of the number of binding sites for the substrate analogue succinate in the catalytic subunit yields a value in agreement with the proposed model. Further support for a hexameric structure comes from the fact that aspartate transcarbamylase contains six tightly bound zinc ions. The metal ions are not required for catalysis and can be replaced by cadmium in vivo or in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1522246139,"Crystalline pyruvate oxidase, a soluble tetrameric flavoprotein from Escherichia coli, which binds both thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and FAD is activated 15- to 100-fold by phospholipids and long chain fatty acids. Maximal activation of the oxidase requires incubation of the enzyme for at least 6 min with the lipid activator in the presence of substrate and cofactors (pyruvate, TPP, and MgCl2). Very little activation occurs if any of these components are omitted from the mixture. Furthermore, activation is markedly reduced if the enzyme is incubated with phospholipid before pyruvate, TPP, and MgCl2 are added. Phosphatides dramatically effect the kinetic parameters of the pyruvate oxidase reaction. The Km values for pyruvate and TPP are lowered 13-fold and 3- to 4-fold, respectively, in the presence of phospholipid. In addition, phosphatides bestow cooperativity to the enzyme with respect to binding of TPP in a very unusual fashion. In the absence of phospholipid, TPP binding to the enzyme follows ordinary Michaelis-Menten type saturation kinetics. In the presence of phospholipid, TPP binds cooperatively to the enzyme and shifts the Km for TPP to a lower value. Stopped-flow experiments measuring the rate of reduction of enzyme-bound FAD clearly indicate that the presence of lipid activator affects a rate-controlling step leading to the formation of enzyme-FADH2. The rate of reduction of enzyme-bound FAD is increased at least 100-fold in the presence of phospholipid. The physiological significance of pyruvate oxidase and the activation phenomenon are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1519032971,"Abstract The specificity of protein acceptors in the arginine transfer reaction has been investigated employing the criterion that a true acceptor be capable of accepting nearly stoichiometric quantities of arginine in the reaction catalyzed by arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase. A single protein was found to account for about 50% of the total acceptor activity in crude soluble extracts from rabbit liver. This protein was isolated and identified as rabbit albumin on the basis of its electrophoretic mobility, molecular weight, and amino acid composition. Of 38 defined proteins and polypeptides which have been tested, seven were found to function as acceptors. These were bovine, rabbit, and human albumins, bovine thyroglobulin, two human Bence-Jones proteins, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. These proteins are all known to have aspartic or glutamic acid as their NH2-terminal residue. The results indicate that the arginine-transfer reaction is highly specific with respect to protein acceptors and that this specificity is based on the presence of aspartic acid or glutamic acid at the NH2 termini."

https://openalex.org/W1484444674,"Abstract The complex of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase with lipoyl transsuccinylase isolated from cauliflower florets and assayed with exogenous lipoyl dehydrogenase, is markedly activated by adenosine 5'-monophosphate. This activation shows an optimum at about 1 mm AMP, with higher concentrations producing a smaller increase in rate. Kinetic analysis shows the activation to be of the coupling type in which the activator binds to the enzyme-substrate complex. The presence of AMP causes an increase in the maximal velocity of the reaction, measured with variable concentrations of α-ketoglutarate, and decreases the apparent Km for α-keto-glutarate. With the use of the parameters V''max (maximal velocity at infinite activator concentration) and K''m (K''m for α-keto-glutarate at infinite activator concentration) and the ratio V''max: K''m (designated as an activation coefficient), it has been possible to compare the activation by AMP with other nucleotides and related compounds. This comparison shows that AMP is 10 times more effective than ADP, which in turn is about twice as effective as ATP, which produces an activation coefficient about twice that of the untreated control. This method of comparison of activating effectiveness reveals that adenosine nucleotides are preferred by this enzyme, that the 2' and 3' —OH groups on the ribose of the nucleotide are involved in producing a maximal activation, and that both the purine or pyrimidine ring and the phosphate are necessary for maximal effect. Inorganic phosphate produces a significant activation. Hill plots of the rate of this reaction against α-ketoglutarate concentration have a slope of 1, which is not altered by the presence of nucleotide activators. Hill plots of rate against nucleotide concentration also give a slope of 1."

https://openalex.org/W1974677911,"THE effects of poisons on the development and survival of fertilized fish eggs have often been described but little information is available on the effects of such substances on either the gametes or fertilization. Mann, for example, has reported1 that a dodecylbenzenesulphonate detergent caused a 26% loss of mobility of trout spermatozoa at a concentration of 5 mg l.−1, and the anaesthetic drug tricaine methanesulphonate was found2 not to affect fertilization provided that the concentration did not exceed 50 mg l.−1. The effects of heavy metals on these life stages and processes do not, however, seem to be known, even though these poisons are common pollutants of river waters in industrial areas. We report here results of preliminary tests made at this laboratory into the effects of copper and nickel on the fertilization of eggs of the rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri Richardson."
https://openalex.org/W1989662219,"PREVIOUS reports of the life cycle of the slug, Agriolimax reticulatus (Müller)1,4, have maintained that there are two generations a year. A spring generation hatches in March to May and grows during the summer to give rise to an autumn generation which hatches in September to October and this grows during the winter to produce the next spring generation. In a recent study at Cambridge this pattern seemed to be confirmed. Outdoor cultures of A. reticulatus were kept on soil with adequate food and moisture and laid eggs within 5–7 months of hatching."
https://openalex.org/W1526208312,"In Escherichia coli W3110 polA1, an enzyme possessing the following catalytic properties has been found: (a) The enzyme catalyzes the formation of polydeoxyadenylate, polydeoxycytidylate, polydeoxyguanylate, and polydeoxythymidylate from corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates. The rate of formation of the polydeoxyribonucleotide containing deoxyadenylate, deoxycytidylate, deoxyguanylate, and deoxythymidylate is relatively slow. (b) The phosphorolysis of deoxyribonucleic acid and the exchange between inorganic phosphate and the terminal phosphate of deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates in the presence of the enzyme proceed at an extremely slow rate. (c) Polymerization of deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates requires the presence of manganous ion; magnesium ion is almost without effect on the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2470700320,"The role of DNA replication in the synthesis of RNA and proteins during the period of the infective cycle of T5-infected Escherichia coli F has been examined. Inhibition of DNA synthesis was achieved by addition of chloramphenicol to T5-infected cultures or by use of a mutant of T5 (T5 am I), which is unable to cause the synthesis of an active DNA polymerase upon infection of the nonpermissive host, E. coli F. The synthesis of late or Class III RNA and lysozyme, a presumed late protein, was measured. In the absence of DNA synthesis a small amount of late or Class III RNA species is formed by 9 to 12 min after infection, but much greater quantities are produced under conditions allowing concurrent DNA replication. The synthesis of T5 lysozyme occurs normally in both the permissive and nonpermissive hosts."
https://openalex.org/W126350756,"An analysis has been made of the degradation of T5-specific RNA in the presence of rifampicin, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis. The average half-time of disappearance of either acid-precipitable labeled RNA or high molecular weight RNA bands identified by disc electrophoresis-autoradiography was 4 to 5 min at 37°. Several relatively stable degradation products between the molecular weights 8.0 x 104 and 3.1 x 104, as well as a large fraction of stable RNA fragments of 4 S size, were identified. These discrete degradation products were formed in the presence of chloramphenicol as well as in the absence of this inhibitor of protein synthesis. Therefore, at least one nuclease must be involved in the turnover of messenger RNA to specific degradation products that is not dependent on the process of protein synthesis for its activity. This nuclease is probably a host enzyme."
