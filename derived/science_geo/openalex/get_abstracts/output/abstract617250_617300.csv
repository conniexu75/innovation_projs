https://openalex.org/W2889229834,"Increased glucose consumption distinguishes cancer cells from normal cells and is known as the because of increased glycolysis. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a key glycolytic enzyme, a hallmark of aggressive cancers, and believed to be the major enzyme responsible for pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. To elucidate its role in tumor growth, we disrupted both the LDHA and LDHB genes in two cancer cell lines (human colon adenocarcinoma and murine melanoma cells). Surprisingly, neither LDHA nor LDHB knockout strongly reduced lactate secretion. In contrast, double knockout (LDHA/B-DKO) fully suppressed LDH activity and lactate secretion. Furthermore, under normoxia, LDHA/B-DKO cells survived the genetic block by shifting their metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), entailing a 2-fold reduction in proliferation rates in vitro and in vivo compared with their WT counterparts. Under hypoxia (1% oxygen), however, LDHA/B suppression completely abolished in vitro growth, consistent with the reliance on OXPHOS. Interestingly, activation of the respiratory capacity operated by the LDHA/B-DKO genetic block as well as the resilient growth were not consequences of long-term adaptation. They could be reproduced pharmacologically by treating WT cells with an LDHA/B-specific inhibitor (GNE-140). These findings demonstrate that the Warburg effect is not only based on high LDHA expression, as both LDHA and LDHB need to be deleted to suppress fermentative glycolysis. Finally, we demonstrate that the Warburg effect is dispensable even in aggressive tumors and that the metabolic shift to OXPHOS caused by LDHA/B genetic disruptions is responsible for the tumors' escape and growth."

https://openalex.org/W2889275779,"The social impact of research has usually been analysed through the scientific outcomes produced under the auspices of the research. The growth of scholarly content in social media and the use of altmetrics by researchers to track their work facilitate the advancement in evaluating the impact of research. However, there is a gap in the identification of evidence of the social impact in terms of what citizens are sharing on their social media platforms. This article applies a social impact in social media methodology (SISM) to identify quantitative and qualitative evidence of the potential or real social impact of research shared on social media, specifically on Twitter and Facebook. We define the social impact coverage ratio (SICOR) to identify the percentage of tweets and Facebook posts providing information about potential or actual social impact in relation to the total amount of social media data found related to specific research projects. We selected 10 projects in different fields of knowledge to calculate the SICOR, and the results indicate that 0.43% of the tweets and Facebook posts collected provide linkages with information about social impact. However, our analysis indicates that some projects have a high percentage (4.98%) and others have no evidence of social impact shared in social media. Examples of quantitative and qualitative evidence of social impact are provided to illustrate these results. A general finding is that novel evidences of social impact of research can be found in social media, becoming relevant platforms for scientists to spread quantitative and qualitative evidence of social impact in social media to capture the interest of citizens. Thus, social media users are showed to be intermediaries making visible and assessing evidence of social impact."
https://openalex.org/W2888447253,"Submillimeter bright galaxies in the early Universe are vigorously forming stars at ~1000 times higher rate than the Milky Way. A large fraction of stars is formed in the central 1 kiloparsec region, that is comparable in size to massive, quiescent galaxies found at the peak of the cosmic star formation history, and eventually the core of giant elliptical galaxies in the present-day Universe. However, the physical and kinematic properties inside a compact starburst core are poorly understood because dissecting it requires angular resolution even higher than the Hubble Space Telescope can offer. Here we report 550 parsec-resolution observations of gas and dust in the brightest unlensed submillimeter galaxy at z=4.3. We map out for the first time the spatial and kinematic structure of molecular gas inside the heavily dust-obscured core. The gas distribution is clumpy while the underlying disk is rotation-supported. Exploiting the high-quality map of molecular gas mass surface density, we find a strong evidence that the starburst disk is gravitationally unstable, implying that the self-gravity of gas overcomes the differential rotation and the internal pressure by stellar radiation feedback. The observed molecular gas would be consumed by star formation in a timescale of 100 million years, that is comparable to those in merging starburst galaxies. Our results suggest that the most extreme starburst in the early Universe originates from efficient star formation due to a gravitational instability in the central 2 kpc region."
https://openalex.org/W2889185145,"Exposure to vinclozolin has been shown to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of increased susceptibility to disease, and to induce transgenerational changes to the epigenome. In the current study, gestating F0 generation rats were exposed to vinclozolin, and the subsequent F1, F2 and transgenerational F3 generations were evaluated for diseases and pathologies. F1 and F2 generation rats exhibited few abnormalities. However, F3 generation rats showed transgenerational increases in testis, prostate, and kidney disease, changes in the age of puberty onset in males, and an increased obesity rate in females. Overall there was an increase in the rate of animals with disease, and in the incidence of animals with multiple diseases. The objective of the current study was to analyze the sperm epigenome of F3 generation rats with specific abnormalities and compare them to rats without those abnormalities, in an effort to find epigenetic biomarkers of transgenerational disease. Unique signatures of differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) in sperm were found that associated with testis disease, prostate disease and kidney disease. Confounding factors identified were the presence of multiple diseases in the analysis and the limited number of animals without disease. These results further our understanding of the mechanisms governing epigenetic transgenerational inheritance, and may lead in the future to the use of epigenetic biomarkers that will help predict an individual’s susceptibility for specific diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2888806359,"Among the several mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR), overexpression of drug efflux pumps CaCdr1p and CaMdr1p belonging to ATP binding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) respectively remain the predominant mechanisms of candidal infections. Therefore inhibiting or modulating the function of these transporters continues to draw attention as effective strategy to combat MDR. We have previously reported the antifungal potential of Geraniol (Ger), a natural monoterpenoid from Palmarosa oil, against Candida albicans. Herein, we explored the fungicidal nature of Ger. The Rhodamine 6G (R6G) and Nile red accumulation confirms the specific effect on CaCdr1p. Mechanistic insights with Candida cells overexpressing CaCdr1p and CaMdr1p revealed that Ger specifically modulates CaCdr1p activity. Kinetic studies further unraveled the competitive inhibition of Ger for R6G efflux as evident from increased apparent Km without affecting Vmax value. The effect of Ger on CaCdr1p was substantiated by molecular docking analyses, which depicted in-silico binding affinity of Ger with CaCdr1p and explored that Ger binds to the active site of CaCdr1p with higher binding energy. Although RT-PCR and western blot revealed no change in expressions of CDR1 and CaCdr1p, confocal microscopy images however depicted CaCdr1p mislocalization in presence of Ger. Interestingly, Ger was synergistic (FICI<0.5) with fluconazole (FLC) which is a well known antifungal drug. Furthermore, Ger sensitizes the FLC sensitive and resistant clinical matched pair of isolates Gu4/Gu5 and led to abrogated R6G efflux and depleted ergosterol. Furthermore, Rhodamine B labeling demonstrates altered mitochondrial potential with Ger which suggest possible linkage of dysfunctional mitochondria with CaCdr1p activity. We also estimated phenotypic virulence marker extracellular phospholipase activity which was considerably diminished along with inhibited cell adherence and biofilm biomass. Lastly, antifungal efficacy of Ger was demonstrated by enhanced survival of Caenorhabditis elegans model and negligible hemolytic activity (20%). Together, modulation of efflux pump activity by Ger and FLC synergism represent a promising approach for combinatorial treatment of candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2889255937,"Common bean productivity is reduced by several abiotic stress factors like drought and low soil fertility, leading to yield losses particularly in low input smallholder farming systems in the tropics. To understand the genetics of stress tolerance, and to improve adaptation of common bean to adverse environments, the BAT 881 x G21212 population of 95 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was evaluated under different abiotic stress conditions in 15 trials across four locations in Colombia, representing two higher altitude (Darién, Popayán) and two lower altitude (Palmira, Quilichao) locations. Stress vs non-stress treatments showed that yields were reduced in drought trials in Palmira by 13 and 31%, respectively, and observed yield reductions in low phosphorus stress were 39% in Quilichao, 16% in Popayán, and 71% in Darién, respectively. Yield components and biomass traits were also reduced. Traits linked to dry matter redistribution from stems, leaves and pods to seed, such as pod harvest index and total non-structural carbohydrates, were found to be important factors contributing to yield in all conditions. In contrast, early maturity was correlated with improved yield only in lower altitude locations, whereas in higher altitudes delayed maturity promoted yield. Superior RILs that combine stress tolerance and high cross-location productivity were identified. Lines that showed good yield under strong stress conditions also performed well under non-stress conditions, indicating that breeder's selection can be applied for both conditions at the same time. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses revealed a stable yield QTL on chromosome Pv04, detected individually in all locations, several stress treatments and in best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) across all trials. Furthermore, two QTL hotspots for maturity traits were identified on Pv01 and Pv08, which are the most stable QTL. The constitutive yield QTL could serve as a good candidate for marker development and could be used in marker assisted selection. Increased understanding of the physiology of abiotic stress tolerance, combined with the availability of superior germplasm and molecular tools, will aid breeding efforts for further improvement of these plant traits."
https://openalex.org/W2889458320,"Background and aims N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), which are autoinducer quorum-sensing molecules involved in the bacterial communication network, also interact with eukaryotic cells. Searching for these molecules in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is appealing. The aims of our study were to look for AHL molecules in faecal samples from healthy subjects (HS) and IBD patients to correlate AHL profiles with the microbiome and investigate the effect of AHLs of interest on epithelial cells. Methods Using mass spectrometry, we characterised AHL profiles in faecal samples from HS (n = 26) and IBD patients in remission (n = 24) and in flare (n = 25) and correlated the presence of AHLs of interest with gut microbiota composition obtained by real-time qPCR and 16S sequencing. We synthesised AHLs of interest to test the inflammatory response after IL1β stimulation and paracellular permeability on Caco-2 cells. Results We observed 14 different AHLs, among which one was prominent. This AHL corresponded to 3-oxo-C12:2 and was found significantly less frequently in IBD patients in flare (16%) and in remission (37.5%) versus HS (65.4%) (p = 0.001). The presence of 3-oxo-C12:2 was associated with significantly higher counts of Firmicutes, especially Faecalbacterium prausnitzii, and lower counts of Escherichia coli. In vitro, 3-oxo-C12:2 exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, although 3-oxo-C12, the well-known AHL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, increased paracellular permeability, 3-oxo-C12:2 did not. Conclusions We identified AHLs in the human gut microbiota and discovered a new and prominent AHL, 3-oxo-C12:2, which correlates with normobiosis and exerts a protective effect on gut epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2889314636,"Purpose To identify disease-specific cytokine profile differences in the aqueous humor (AH) (other than the vascular endothelial growth factor) between patients with dry and treated wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and healthy controls. Methods This retrospective study drew on a case-series of patients diagnosed with dry AMD (n = 25) and treated wet AMD (n = 19), as well as on healthy controls (no systemic therapy; n = 20) undergoing phacoemulsification or vitrectomy. Samples of AH and serum were collected in parallel at the beginning of surgery. The levels of 43 cytokines were simultaneously determined using the Bio-Plex® multiplex beads system. Differences between the three groups were statistically compared using the Kruskal-Wallis H-Test after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p<0.0012). Results The concentrations of three cytokines were elevated in the AH of patients with dry AMD (CXCL6; p = 0.00067) and treated wet AMD (CXCL5, CXCL6, MIG/XCXL; all p<0.001) relative to those in the healthy controls. No other differences between the three groups were identified. The AH levels of seven cytokines (16%), including CXCL6, ranged below the lower limit of quantitation of the assay. Without the correction for multiple comparisons (p<0.05), the levels of 31 of the 43 cytokines in the AH of patients with AMD would have differed significantly from those in the control. The systemic cytokine profiles (serum) were similar in all three groups. Conclusions No systematic differences in the AH cytokine environment were identified between patients with dry AMD and those with treated wet AMD. This finding might indicate that AMD is either the result of a persistent imbalance in the physiological tissue milieu, or that the localized process induces no significant change in the cytokine environment of the anterior ocular segment."
https://openalex.org/W2889224376,"Phagocytic cells in fish secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as piscidins, glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, and copper ions as first-line immune defenses. Recently, we established that Cu2+ coordination by piscidins 1 (P1) and 3 (P3) enhances their antibacterial activity against membranes and DNA. Interestingly, we noted that physicochemical similarities exist between both piscidins and other AMPs that interact with heparin and induce immune-cell chemotaxis through formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) involved in innate immunity. Thus, we postulated that P1 and P3 interact with heparin and FPRs but that these interactions distinctively depend on Cu2+. Here, we investigate the interactome potentiated by piscidins, heparin, FPR, and Cu2+. Utilizing FPR-transfected cells and neutrophils, we demonstrate that both piscidins exclusively use FPR1 and FPR2 to induce chemotaxis and that Cu2+ reduces their chemotaxis induction. P1 is more effective at activating FPR1 than P3 and other known AMP ligands. Furthermore, the expression of Fpr2 on the surface of neutrophils is down-regulated by both peptides. Copper conjugation of the peptides does not further increase down-regulation, suggesting that the conformational changes induced by the metal translate into reduced FPR efficacy without altering the binding affinity. Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that piscidin–heparin interactions are Cu2+-dependent and reduced at the acidic pH of phagosomes. Although heparin decreases the antimicrobial activity of P3–Cu2+, it does not affect bacterial killing by P1–Cu2+. Copper's effects on modulating the micromolar-range interactions of both piscidins with FPR and heparin suggest that the interactome of these distinct immune agents plays an important role in innate immunity. The interactions between diverse host-defense molecules uncovered here may help inform the design of novel therapeutics to treat immune-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2889032069,"Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational addition of a 16-carbon lipid chain involved in trafficking and compartmentalizing target proteins. It is important for many cellular functions, including signaling via membrane-localized estrogen receptors (ERs). Within the nervous system, palmitoylation of ERα is necessary for membrane surface localization and mediation of downstream signaling through the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Substitution of the single palmitoylation site on ERα prevents its physical association with the integral membrane protein caveolin-1 (CAV1), required for the formation of the ER/mGluR signaling complex. Interestingly, siRNA knockdown of either of two palmitoyl acyltransferases, zinc finger DHHC type–containing 7 (DHHC7) or DHHC21, also eliminates this signaling mechanism. Because ERα has only one palmitoylation site, we hypothesized that one of these DHHCs palmitoylates CAV1. We investigated this possibility by using an acyl–biotin exchange assay in HEK293 cells in conjunction with DHHC overexpression and found that DHHC7 increases CAV1 palmitoylation. Substitution of the palmitoylation sites on CAV1 eliminated this effect but did not disrupt the ability of the DHHC enzyme to associate with CAV1. In contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DHHC7 alone was not sufficient to decrease CAV1 palmitoylation but rather required simultaneous knockdown of DHHC21. These findings provide additional information about the overall influence of palmitoylation on the membrane-initiated estrogen signaling pathway and highlight the importance of considering the influence of palmitoylation on other CAV1-dependent processes.

https://openalex.org/W2889114261,"There are many marine protected areas (MPAs) containing coral reef aggregations in the eastern Pacific region. However, the connectivity of corals between MPAs is still poorly known, especially in the Marine Conservation Corridor of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (MCCETP). Here, we assess the potential connectivity of corals across equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs through a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled offline with an ocean-circulation numerical model. Connectivity metrics and graph theory were used to analyze the networks and highlight those MPAs that are critical for maintaining the connectivity of corals across the region. Our results show that the equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs form a relatively well-connected network, at least 40% of coral larvae released per year end up within the boundaries of an MPA. MPAs like Malpelo and Gorgona islands included in the MCCETP were found to be critical for connectivity of corals because of their high betweenness centrality and potential role as stepping-stones between coastal MPAs and offshore MPAs such as the Galapagos Islands. Two pelagic larval duration (PLD) scenarios (40 and 130 days) indicate a quasi-unidirectional larval flow from coastal MPAs toward oceanic MPAs, where the only resilient MPAs (Coiba and Malpelo islands) depend mostly on subsidiary recruitment from MPAs located along the coast of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. In the two PLD scenarios, Cocos Island maintains a very low resilience potential. Our results indicate the imperative need to include coastal MPAs in the MCCETP network initiative, since connectivity and resilience of coral reefs in the equatorial eastern Pacific region rely heavily on coastal MPAs."
https://openalex.org/W2889211437,"The knowledge on environmentally relevant chemicals that may interfere with thyroid signaling is scarce. Here, we present a method for the screening of goitrogens, compounds that disrupt the thyroid gland function, based on the automatic orientation of zebrafish in a glass capillary and a subsequent imaging of reporter gene fluorescence in the thyroid gland of embryos of the transgenic zebrafish line tg(tg:mCherry). The tg(tg:mCherry) reporter gene indicates a compensatory upregulation of thyroglobulin, the thyroid hormone precursor, in response to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis. Fish embryos were exposed to a negative control compound (3,4-dichloroaniline), or a concentration series of known goitrogenic compounds (resorcinol, methimazole, potassium perchlorate, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil, ethylenethiourea, phloroglucinol, pyrazole) with maximum exposure concentration selected based on mortality and/or solubility. Exposure to 3,4-dichloroaniline decreased the fluorescence signal. All goitrogenic compounds exhibited clear concentration-dependent inductions of reporter fluorescence 1.4 to 2.6 fold above control levels. Concentration-response modelling was used to calculate goitrogenic potencies based on EC50 values. The new automated method offers an efficient screening approach for goitrogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2889205055,"Objectives To identify risk factors and clinical outcomes in patients with bacteremia due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli, as well as to determine the prevalence and genetic background of such isolates. Methods Case control study was performed with patients with E. coli bacteremia between January 2008 and May 2013 (n = 115) at a tertiary university hospital in Japan. Cases had ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC) whereas controls had non-ESBL-producing E. coli (non-ESBL-EC) isolates. A retrospective chart review was performed to identify risk factors and clinical outcomes. Isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, polymerase chain reaction analysis for beta-lactamase genes, and multi-locus sequence typing. Results Of 115 unique cases of E. coli bacteremia, 30 (26.1%) were due to ESBL-EC and three (2.6%) were due to carbapenemase-producing E. coli. All three carbapenemase-producing E. coli isolates were IMP-6 and concurrently produced ESBL (ESBL/IMP-6-EC). ESBL-EC isolates showed multidrug resistance. Of the ESBL-EC isolates, CTX-M-27 was the most prevalent (33.3%), followed by CTX-M-14 (30%). Multi-locus sequence typing revealed that 19 (63.3%) isolates were ST131. The multivariate analysis identified nursing home-associated infections and antibiotic administration in the preceding 30 days as risk factors for ESBL-EC bacteremia. The 14-day mortality non-ESBL-EC, ESBL-EC, and ESBL/IMP-6-EC was 4.7% (4/85), 20% (6/30), and 66.7% (2/3), respectively. Conclusions CTX-M-27, CTX-M-14, and ST131 were the most prevalent ESBL-EC isolates from bacteremic patients in a Japanese hospital. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to investigate the clinical significance of ESBL-EC and ESBL/IMP-6-EC."
https://openalex.org/W2889428352,"Five evacuation experiments were performed in a road tunnel in order to test how pedestrians react when exposed to reduced visibility, how the decision making process is carried out, and finally what is the impact of various circumstances like: different level of smokiness, competitive behavior or learning effect on an evacuation process. In four experiments pedestrians were exposed to artificial, non-toxic smoke. During evacuation of a group of people gathered in low and moderate level of smokiness (when Cs < 0.5m-1) we observed multi-line patterns created by pedestrians. Decision making was engaged in only by the first group of passengers, while under heavy smokiness Cs > 0.7m-1 we have observed decision making by small groups and characteristic double-lines patterns. In four experiments the same group of participants was involved, and a learning effect was observed: increasingly shorter pre-movement time and decreasing time required to leave the main tunnel. We show, that movement speed in smoke is influenced by the evacuees' attitude and familiarity with environment and evacuation procedures and not only by the visibility level."
https://openalex.org/W2888810076,"Prokaryotic argonautes are a unique class of nucleic acid-guided endonucleases putatively involved in cellular defense against foreign genetic elements. While their eukaryotic homologs and Cas protein counterparts require single-stranded RNAs as guides, some prokaryotic argonautes are able to utilize short single-stranded DNAs as guides for sequence-specific endonuclease activity. Many complications currently prevent the use of prokaryotic argonautes for in vivo gene-editing applications; however, they do exhibit potential as a new class of in vitro molecular tools if certain challenges can be overcome, specifically the limitations on substrate accessibility which leads to unequal levels of activity across a broad palate of substrates and the inability to act on double-stranded DNA substrates. Here we demonstrate the use of accessory factors, including thermostable single-stranded DNA binding proteins and UvrD-like helicase, in conjunction with prokaryotic argonautes to significantly improve enzymatic activity and enable functionality with a broader range of substrates, including linear double-stranded DNA substrates. We also demonstrate the use of Thermus thermophilus argonaute with accessory factors as a programmable restriction enzyme to generate long, unique single-stranded overhangs from linear double-stranded substrates compatible with downstream ligation."
https://openalex.org/W2889284465,"Misconceptions, lack of knowledge, and negative attitudes towards sharks act as barriers preventing actions required to tackle threats to shark populations, limiting the success of global shark conservation initiatives. Peru, a major player for the international trade of shark products, recently approved the ‘National Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, Rays and Chimaeras’ (PAN-Tib); a guiding document for conservation initiatives aimed at these fishes. Within PAN-Tib, the assessment of Peruvians’ current knowledge and attitudes towards sharks is listed as a research priority. Between June and October 2016, 2004 Peruvians were surveyed along the coast to characterize their (i) shark meat consumption patterns, and (ii) knowledge and attitudes towards sharks. Results suggest that shark meat consumption is extended, but not necessarily frequent, and higher in the northern regions of the country. However, 77.5% of shark meat consumers were unaware that they had eaten sharks. Although 57.6% of the participants recognized that sharks are present in Peruvian waters, only 19.4% of the surveyed population was capable of naming at least one local shark species. Moreover, Peruvians have very negative attitudes towards sharks. They fear them and view them as man-eaters, despite this, no shark attacks have ever been reported in the country. These results highlight the need to: (i) encourage sustainable shark meat consumption, and (ii) promote communication campaigns aimed at increasing knowledge about sharks, and their importance as a source of employment and food for coastal communities, as for the national economy."
https://openalex.org/W2889149999,"The N-end rule pathway is a proteolytic system in which single N-terminal amino acids of proteins act as a class of degrons (N-degrons) that determine the half-lives of proteins. We have previously identified a family of mammals N-recognins (termed UBR1, UBR2, UBR4/p600, and UBR5/EDD) whose conserved UBR boxes bind N-degrons to facilitate substrate ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Amongst these N-recognins, UBR1 and UBR2 mediate ubiquitination and proteolysis of short-lived regulators and misfolded proteins. Here, we characterized the null phenotypes of UBR4-deficient mice in which the UBR box of UBR4 was deleted. We show that the mutant mice die around embryonic days 9.5–10.5 (E9.5–E10.5) associated with abnormalities in various developmental processes such as neurogenesis and cardiovascular development. These developmental defects are significantly attributed to the inability to maintain cell integrity and adhesion, which significantly correlates to the severity of null phenotypes. UBR4-loss induces the depletion of many, but not all, proteins from the plasma membrane, suggesting that UBR4 is involved in proteome-wide turnover of cell surface proteins. Indeed, UBR4 is associated with and required to generate the multivesicular body (MVB) which transiently store endocytosed cell surface proteins before their targeting to autophagosomes and subsequently lysosomes. Our results suggest that the N-recognin UBR4 plays a role in the homeostasis of cell surface proteins and, thus, cell adhesion and integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2888969373,"The purpose of this study was to establish GENEA (Gravity Estimator of Normal Everyday Activity) cut-points for discriminating between six relative-intensity activity levels in middle-aged recreational marathoners. Nighty-eight (83 males and 15 females) recreational marathoners, aged 30–45 years, completed a cardiopulmonary exercise test running on a treadmill while wearing a GENEA accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist. The breath-by-breath V̇O2 data was also collected for criterion measure of physical activity categories (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous and extremely vigorous). GENEA cut-points for physical activity classification was performed via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Spearman’s correlation test was applied to determine the relationship between estimated and measured intensity classifications. Statistical analysis were done for all individuals, and separating samples by sex. The GENEA cut-points established were able to distinguish between all six-relative intensity levels with an excellent classification accuracy (area under the ROC curve (AUC) values between 0.886 and 0.973) for all samples. When samples were separated by sex, AUC values were 0.881–0.973 and 0.924–0.968 for males and females, respectively. The total variance in energy expenditure explained by GENEA accelerometer data was 78.50% for all samples, 78.14% for males, and 83.17% for females. In conclusion, the wrist-worn GENEA accelerometer presents a high capacity of classifying the intensity of physical activity in middle-aged recreational marathoners when examining all samples together, as well as when sample set was separated by sex. This study suggests that the triaxial GENEA accelerometers (worn on the non-dominant wrist) can be used to predict energy expenditure for running activities."
https://openalex.org/W2888796257,"Objective Home independence is an important issue for the elderly in many countries and cultures. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of short-stay service use on stay-at-home duration for elderly people by level of care need under the Japanese long-term care insurance system. Methods We analyzed anonymous, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan Long-Term Care Insurance claims data from Ibaraki Prefecture. All participants were certified as eligible for long-term care insurance and had moved into a facility under long-term care insurance after certification between April 2006 and March 2012. Data was analyzed for 2,454 participants aged 65 years or older who entered residential care at least 1 month after initial use of care services. The participants were divided into 2 groups (low- and high-care need), depending on their required level of care. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of residential care admission after initial use of care services. Results Use of short-stay services was positively correlated to delay of residential care admission compared to non-use in the low-care need group (HR; 0.834, 95% confidence interval (CI); 0.740–0.939). In the high-care need group, however, use of short-stay services was somewhat correlated with earlier admission (HR; 1.254, 95% CI; 1.084–1.451). Conclusions The results of this study show that appropriate timing short-stay service use is necessary for the elderly to stay at home longer."
https://openalex.org/W2889486137,"Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) results in severe sub-lesional muscle atrophy and fiber type transformation from slow oxidative to fast glycolytic, both contributing to functional deficits and maladaptive metabolic profiles. Therapeutic countermeasures have had limited success and muscle-related pathology remains a clinical priority. mTOR signaling is known to play a critical role in skeletal muscle growth and metabolism, and signal integration of anabolic and catabolic pathways. Recent studies show that the natural compound ursolic acid (UA) enhances mTOR signaling intermediates, independently inhibiting atrophy and inducing hypertrophy. Here, we examine the effects of UA treatment on sub-lesional muscle mTOR signaling, catabolic genes, and functional deficits following severe SCI in mice. We observe that UA treatment significantly attenuates SCI induced decreases in activated forms of mTOR, and signaling intermediates PI3K, AKT, and S6K, and the upregulation of catabolic genes including FOXO1, MAFbx, MURF-1, and PSMD11. In addition, UA treatment improves SCI induced deficits in body and sub-lesional muscle mass, as well as functional outcomes related to muscle function, motor coordination, and strength. These findings provide evidence that UA treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy to improve muscle-specific pathological consequences of SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2889061912,"Dengue is a prevalent disease in Colombia and all dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) co-circulate in the country since 2001. However, the relative impact of gene flow and local diversification on epidemic dynamics is unknown due to heterogeneous sampling and lack of sufficient genetic data. The region of Santander is one of the areas with the highest incidence of dengue in Colombia. To provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of dengue, we inferred DENV population dynamics using samples collected between 1998 and 2015. We used Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and included 143 new envelope gene sequences from Colombia, mainly from the region of Santander, and 235 published sequences from representative countries in the Americas. We documented one single genotype for each serotype but multiple introductions. Whereas the majority of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4 strains fell into one single lineage, DENV-3 strains fell into two distinct lineages that co-circulated. The inferred times to the most recent common ancestors for the most recent clades of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4 fell between 1977 and 1987, and for DENV-3 was around 1995. Demographic reconstructions suggested a gradual increase in viral diversity over time. A phylogeographical analysis underscored that Colombia mainly receives viral lineages and a significant diffusion route between Colombia and Venezuela. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the viral diversity and dengue epidemiology in Colombia."
https://openalex.org/W2889191872,"HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been associated with increased cardiovascular disease and important changes in lipid metabolism. Advances in mass-spectrometry technology allow for the detailed assessment of individual lipid species which may illuminate the mechanisms underlying increased cardiovascular risk. We describe the change in plasma lipidome with initiation of antiretroviral therapy and compare these by regimen.Plasma lipid profiling (by electrospray isonisation-tandem mass spectrometry) was performed on ARV-naive HIV positive participants randomised to one of three regimens; tenofovir/emtricitabine with efavirenz, ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (atazanavir/r) or zidovudine/abacavir. Participants (n = 115) who remained on their randomised regimen with complete samples available at baseline, week 12 and 48 were included. 306 lipid species from 22 lipid classes were analysed.Initiation of ART led to significant changes in lipidome which were partly dependent on the randomised regimen received. This led to significant differences in 72 lipid species and 7 classes (cholesterol ester, free cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, GM3 ganglioside, trihexosylceramide, monohexosylceramide, and ceramides) by arm at week 48. Consistently higher lipid concentrations were seen with efavirenz compared with atazanavir/r or zidovudine/abacavir. Twelve of the lipid species and two lipid classes (cholesterol esters and ceramides) that were significantly increased in the efavirenz arm compared with the atazanavir/r or zidovudine/abacavir arms have previously been associated with future cardiovascular events in HIV positive patients. Change in HIV viral load was predictive of change in 3 lipid species.Initiation of ART lead to significant changes in the plasma lipidome that were greatest in those receiving efavirenz."
https://openalex.org/W2889498504,"The aim of the experiment was to study the healing at implants installed in site prepared in bone type 1 using different rotation speeds and cooling strategies. The tibiae of twelve sheep were used as experimental sites. Two implant sites were prepared in each tibia using drills either at a high or a mixed speed under irrigation. At the mixed-speed sites, 60 rpm without irrigation were applied for the last drill, the countersink and during implant installation. Biopsies representing the healing after 1, 2, and 6 weeks were obtained and ground sections were prepared. At the histological analyses, after 1 week of healing, no new bone was found at both high- and mixed-speed sites. After 2 weeks of healing, small amounts of newly formed bone were observed in the cortical layer, reaching percentages of 3.6±3.0% at the mixed-speed sites, and of 2.2±1.5% at the high-speed sites. An irrelevant quantity of new bone was seen in the marrow compartments of a few specimens. After 6 weeks of healing, new bone was found in higher quantity, reaching in the cortical compartment 66.9±6.8% and 67.3±17.7% at the mixed- and high-speed sites, respectively. The respective percentages in the marrow compartment were 23.2±13.0% and 30.6±29.2%. No statistically significant differences between high- and mixed-speed groups were found. It was concluded that the use of the last drill and the installation of the implant with or without irrigation yielded similar bone healing and osseointegration."
https://openalex.org/W2949236800,"Somatic mutations in mononucleotide repeats are commonly used to assess the mismatch repair status of tumours. Current tests focus on repeats with a length above 15bp, which tend to be somatically more unstable than shorter ones. These longer repeats also have a substantially higher PCR error rate, and tests that use capillary electrophoresis for fragment size analysis often require expert interpretation. In this communication, we present a panel of 17 short repeats (length 7-12bp) for sequence-based microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. Using a simple scoring procedure that incorporates the allelic distribution of the mutant repeats, and analysis of two cohort of tumours totalling 209 samples, we show that this panel is able to discriminate between MMR proficient and deficient tumours, even when constitutional DNA is not available. In the training cohort, the method achieved 100% concordance with fragment analysis, while in the testing cohort, 4 discordant samples were observed (corresponding to 97% concordance). Of these, 2 showed discrepancies between fragment analysis and immunohistochemistry and one was reclassified after re-testing using fragment analysis. These results indicate that our approach offers the option of a reliable, scalable routine test for MSI."
https://openalex.org/W2889511531,"Neurons contain a high number of mitochondria, these neuronal cells produce elevated levels of oxidative stress and live for a long time without proliferation; therefore, mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial to their health. Investigations have recently focused on mitochondrial dynamics revealing the ability of these organelles to change their distribution and morphology. It is known that mitochondrial fission is necessary for the transmission of mitochondria to daughter cells during mitosis and mitochondrial fragmentation has been used as an indicator of cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Oxidative stress is a trigger able to induce changes in the mitochondrial network. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of melatonin on the mitochondrial network in HT22 serum-deprived cells. Our results showed that serum deprivation increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, promoted the activation of plasma membrane voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) and affected the expression of pDRP1 and DRP1 fission proteins. Moreover, parallel increases in apoptotic and autophagic features were found. Damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria are deleterious to the cell; hence, the degradation of such mitochondria through mitophagy is crucial to cell survival. Our results suggest that melatonin supplementation reduces cell death and restores mitochondrial function through the regulation of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2889123744,"The balance between the costs and benefits of fleshy fruit production depends on the feeding behavior of their seed dispersers, which might effectively disperse seeds to farther areas or drop beneath parent plants some diaspores they handle during frugivory bouts. Nevertheless, the consequences of variation in fruit handling by primary seed dispersers on the secondary removal of diaspores remains poorly understood. We conducted a field study to determine how variation in fruit handling by avian frugivores affects short-term secondary removal of Miconia irwinii (Melastomataceae) diaspores by the ground-dwelling fauna in campo rupestre vegetation, southeastern Brazil. We conducted factorial experiments manipulating: (1) different outcomes of primary fruit/seed removal by birds, (2) distances of diaspore deposition from conspecifics, and (3) the access of ants and vertebrates to diaspores. We showed that secondary removal of diaspores was highly variable at the population scale, with an overall low removal rate by the ground-dwelling fauna (13% seeds, 19% fruits). However, we found that gut-passed seeds embedded in bird feces were less removed than seeds expelled from fruits. Gut-passed seeds were more likely to be removed by ant species acting as secondary dispersers, whereas pulp-free seeds dropped by birds were likely to interact with potential seed predators, including ants and rodents. We found no clear effect of dispersal from parent plant vicinity on seed removal, but fruit removal was significantly higher near parent plants. Partially defleshed fruits were more removed than intact fruits. The removal of fruits by ant and vertebrate rescuers, including lizards and birds, might reduce the costs of interactions with less effective dispersers that drop partially defleshed fruits under parent plants. Our study highlights that variation in fruit handling by primary avian seed dispersers mediate subsequent interactions among discarded diaspores and ground-dwelling animals, potentially affecting final seed fates. Moreover, we argue that escape-related benefits of dispersal can be contingent on how primary dispersers handle and discard seeds."
https://openalex.org/W2889442140,"Cardiolipin (CL) is an anionic phospholipid mainly located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it helps regulate bioenergetics, membrane structure, and apoptosis. Localized, phase-segregated domains of CL are hypothesized to control mitochondrial inner membrane organization. However, the existence and underlying mechanisms regulating these mitochondrial domains are unclear. Here, we first isolated detergent-resistant cardiac mitochondrial membranes that have been reported to be CL-enriched domains. Experiments with different detergents yielded only nonspecific solubilization of mitochondrial phospholipids, suggesting that CL domains are not recoverable with detergents. Next, domain formation was investigated in biomimetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and newly synthesized giant mitochondrial vesicles (GMVs) from mouse hearts. Confocal fluorescent imaging revealed that introduction of cytochrome c into membranes promotes macroscopic proteolipid domain formation associated with membrane morphological changes in both GUVs and GMVs. Domain organization was also investigated after lowering tetralinoleoyl-CL concentration and substitution with monolyso-CL, two common modifications observed in cardiac pathologies. Loss of tetralinoleoyl-CL decreased proteolipid domain formation in GUVs, because of a favorable Gibbs-free energy of lipid mixing, whereas addition of monolyso-CL had no effect on lipid mixing. Moreover, murine GMVs generated from cardiac acyl-CoA synthetase-1 knockouts, which have remodeled CL acyl chains, did not perturb proteolipid domains. Finally, lowering the tetralinoleoyl-CL content had a stronger influence on the oxidation status of cytochrome c than did incorporation of monolyso-CL.

The limited understanding on the existence of CL-enriched domains comes largely from two- or three-component model membrane studies.

Furthermore, microscopy studies with biomimetic CL-containing mixtures have demonstrated the unique ability of cytochrome c to regulate membrane morphology and induce CL domain formation (24.Beales P.A.

Single vesicle observations of the cardiolipin-cytochrome c interaction: induction of membrane morphology changes.Langmuir. 2011; 27 (21504165): 6107-611510.1021/la104924cCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25.Bergstrom C.L.

CL domains have also been identified biochemically with detergent-extraction methods; similar to approaches used for the study of detergent-resistant “lipid raft” membranes (17.Sorice M.

There are several major gaps in knowledge regarding CL-enriched domain organization. The first major limitation is that many studies have not effectively modeled the inner mitochondrial composition and even relied on lipid raft models (24.Beales P.A. Bergstrom C.L. Geerts N. Groves J.T. Vanderlick T.K. Single vesicle observations of the cardiolipin-cytochrome c interaction: induction of membrane morphology changes.Langmuir. 2011; 27 (21504165): 6107-611510.1021/la104924cCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26.Pennington E.R.

Approximately 70% of the inner mitochondrial membrane is accounted for by phosphatidylcholine (40%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (30%), whereas CL makes up about 15–20% of total phospholipids (7.Osman C. Voelker D.R. Langer T. Making heads or tails of phospholipids in mitochondria.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192 (21220505): 710.1083/jcb.201006159Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylserine account for the remaining phospholipids, with very low levels of cholesterol. Thus, CL domain formation should be studied in the context of inner mitochondrial-mimicking membranes. Second, the underlying mechanistic factors that regulate CL domain formation are not defined. These are essential to establish because in a range of diseases, CL is subject to considerable physiochemical modifications that impair mitochondrial inner membrane structure-function (3.Claypool S.M.

The first objective of this study was to determine the utility of biochemical detergent extraction to isolate CL domains. Subsequently, we investigated if CL domains can form in the absence or presence of select proteins. These proteins included cytochrome c, creatine kinase, and α-synuclein, which are all associated with mitochondrial membranes. The approach relied on quantitative imaging of biomimetic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) modeling the cardiac inner mitochondrial membrane, and the use of giant mitochondrial vesicles (GMVs) constructed for the first time with phospholipids extracted from rodent cardiac mitochondria. Next, we determined if decreased CL levels, or the accumulation of MLCL, as observed in various diseases, disrupted the organization of proteolipid domains. These studies relied on biomimetic mitochondrial GUVs as well as lipid monolayers mimicking the inner mitochondrial membrane lipid composition to quantify lipid-lipid mixing. In parallel, we constructed GMVs using cardiac tissue harvested from control and acyl-CoA synthetase 1 knockout mice to determine how CL remodeling impacted the organization of native phospholipids and thereby proteolipid domains. We first determined if different detergents were equally efficacious at extracting CL-enriched microdomains from rat cardiac mitochondria. Rat myocardial tissue was utilized to ensure a high abundance of material for microdomain isolation. We relied on Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, and digitonin at various concentrations (0.01, 0.05, and 0.5% w/v). Increasing the concentration of all three detergents led to an overall decrease of phospholipid levels, as measured by TLC, in the insoluble detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) (I) fractions (Fig. 1, A–C). This decrease was paralleled by an increase in the amount of lipids in the detergent-soluble membrane (DSM (S)) fractions (Fig. 1, A–C). The increase in the concentration of Triton X-100 from 0.01 to 0.05% caused a larger reduction in the amount of phospholipids present in the DRM fraction than Nonidet P-40 or digitonin (Fig. 1, A–C). At a concentration of 0.5%, phospholipids in the DRM fraction were appreciably reduced with all three detergents (Fig. 1, A–C). Both DSM (S) and DRM (I) fractions were assayed for protein content. Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 had a higher concentration of protein in their DSM fractions than their DRM fractions, at all detergent concentrations (Fig. 1, D and E). Digitonin had more protein in the DRM fraction than the DSM fraction at lower detergent concentrations, but at 0.5% digitonin, very little protein was found in the DRM fraction (Fig. 1F). Overall, these findings challenge the notion that CL microdomains can be effectively isolated with biochemical detergent extraction. Therefore, we used a more controlled and less invasive model system to study CL microdomains. We constructed GUVs, modeling the inner mitochondrial membrane, and GMVs to study CL microdomain organization. GMVs were constructed from native phospholipids extracted from isolated cardiac mitochondria. To visualize GUVs and GMVs, we employed two fluorescent probes, Texas Red DHPE (Texas Red), which is known to report on liquid-disordered domains of lipid membranes (43.Juhasz J. Davis J.H. Sharom F.J. Fluorescent probe partitioning in giant unilamellar vesicles of “lipid raft” mixtures.Biochem.

Structures of the fluorescent probes are presented in Fig. S1, A and B. We first visualized GUVs and GMVs in the absence of cytochrome c (−cyt c) using Texas Red (Fig. 2, A and B, left panels), which revealed a homogenous distribution of the fluorophore throughout the membrane. The addition of 17 μm cyt c to GUVs and GMVs containing Texas Red (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels) revealed fluorophore sequestration and the formation of proteolipid microdomains. The average fluorophore area was calculated using the equatorial cross-sectional view of GUVs and GMVs and was determined to decrease by 1.3–1.4–fold upon the addition of cyt c (Fig. 2, C and D). The formation of phase-segregated domains was accompanied by clear membrane morphological changes with the GUVs and GMVs. To exemplify, the addition of cyt c decreased the average diameter of GUVs and GMVs with Texas Red (Fig. 2, E and F, respectively) by 1.8-fold. We next visualized vesicles using the fluorescent probe NAO. Similar observations to Texas Red were made when GUVs and GMVs were visualized by NAO. In the absence of cyt c, the NAO fluorophore was homogenously distributed throughout the membrane of GUVs and GMVs, and no microdomains were observed (Fig. 3, A and B, left panels). Upon the addition of 17 μm cyt c, strong phase segregation of NAO (Fig. 3, A and B, middle panels) was observed. Quantification revealed that 17 μm cyt c decreased the average fluorophore area by up to 2.2–3.5–fold for GUVs and GMVs visualized by NAO (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively). Similarly, the diameter of the GUVs and GMVs also decreased upon the addition of cyt c by 1.5–2.5 (Fig. 3, E and F, respectively). We conducted co-localization analyses to confirm that the phase-separated domains were forming in regions where cytochrome c was associating. These studies revealed overlap (average Pearson's correlation coefficient of 45.1%) between NAO and an Alexa 647 antibody against cytochrome c (Fig. S2). We also tested if cytochrome c-induced lipid microdomain formation depended on protein concentration. The addition of 3.8 μm cyt c promoted lipid microdomain formation as observed by phase segregation of NAO in GUVs and GMVs (Fig. 3, A and B, right panels). The addition of 3.8 μm cyt c to GUVs and GMVs also decreased the average area occupied by NAO (Fig. 3, C and D) as well as the average vesicle diameter (Fig. 3, E and F). Overall, Texas Red and NAO showed similar results (Figs. 2 and 3); therefore, for the subsequent imaging studies we used NAO given that is suggested to be CL specific (45.Garcia Fernandez M.I. Ceccarelli D. Muscatello U. Use of the fluorescent dye 10-N-nonyl acridine orange in quantitative and location assays of cardiolipin: a study on different experimental models.Anal.

Given that cyt c decreased the diameters of GUVs and GMVs, we hypothesized that cyt c could be promoting changes in the elastic properties of the membrane. Therefore, we constructed biomimetic and native mitochondrial lipid monolayers, in the absence and presence of cyt c, to quantify the elasticity modulus (Cs−1), which is an inverse measure of membrane elasticity. We first present raw surface pressure-area isotherms for both biomimetic (Fig. 4A) and native (Fig. 4B) mitochondrial monolayers in the absence (black lines) and presence (red lines) of 17 μm cyt c. We only tested one concentration of protein because we observed similar effects on microdomain organization with 3.8 and 17 μm cyt c. The isotherms were used to calculate the elasticity modulus at surface pressures of 30 mN/m. The addition of cyt c to biomimetic (Fig. 4C) and native (Fig. 4D) mitochondrial monolayers decreased the elasticity modulus by nearly 2-fold. Therefore, these results demonstrate that cyt c regulates the elastic properties of biomimetic and native mitochondrial monolayers. In several pathologies, such as cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, type 2 diabetes, and Barth syndrome, there is loss of (18:2)4CL content and remodeling of CL acyl chains (27.Chicco A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2889319585,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been linked to a variety of metabolic, neurological and muscular diseases which can present at any time throughout life. MtDNA is replicated by DNA polymerase gamma (Pol γ), twinkle helicase and mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB). The Pol γ holoenzyme is a heterotrimer consisting of the p140 catalytic subunit and a p55 homodimeric accessory subunit encoded by the nuclear genes POLG and POLG2, respectively. The accessory subunits enhance DNA binding and promote processive DNA synthesis of the holoenzyme. Mutations in either POLG or POLG2 are linked to disease and adversely affect maintenance of the mitochondrial genome, resulting in depletion, deletions and/or point mutations in mtDNA. A homozygous mutation located at Chr17: 62492543G>A in POLG2, resulting in R182W substitution in p55, was previously identified to cause mtDNA depletion and fatal hepatic liver failure. Here we characterize this homozygous R182W p55 mutation using in vivo cultured cell models and in vitro biochemical assessments. Compared to control fibroblasts, homozygous R182W p55 primary dermal fibroblasts exhibit a two-fold slower doubling time, reduced mtDNA copy number and reduced levels of POLG and POLG2 transcripts correlating with the reported disease state. Expression of R182W p55 in HEK293 cells impairs oxidative-phosphorylation. Biochemically, R182W p55 displays DNA binding and association with p140 similar to WT p55. R182W p55 mimics the ability of WT p55 to stimulate primer extension, support steady-state nucleotide incorporation, and suppress the exonuclease function of Pol γ in vitro. However, R182W p55 has severe defects in protein stability as determined by differential scanning fluorimetry and in stimulating function as determined by thermal inactivation. These data demonstrate that the Chr17: 62492543G>A mutation in POLG2, R182W p55, severely impairs stability of the accessory subunit and is the likely cause of the disease phenotype."

The trial demonstrated that the regimen was safe and well tolerated and resulted in enhancement of HIV-specific immune responses. Preliminary observations on vaccine-induced immune responses were limited to analysis of neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ ELISPOT response. The present study involves a more detailed analysis of the nature of the vaccine-induced humoral immune response using specimens that were archived from the volunteers at the time of the trial. Interestingly, we found vaccine induced production of V1/V2 and V3 region-specific antibodies in a significant proportion of vaccinees. Variable region antibody levels correlated directly with the frequency of circulating T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and regulatory T cells (Treg). Our findings provide encouraging evidence to demonstrate the immunogenicity of the tested vaccine. Better insights into vaccine-induced immune responses can aid in informing future design of a successfulHIV-1 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2888976168,"Silicon transporters (SIT) are the proteins, which capture silicic acid in the aquatic environment and direct it across the plasmalemma to the cytoplasm of diatoms. Diatoms utilize silicic acid to build species-specific ornamented exoskeletons and make a significant contribution to the global silica cycle, estimated at 240 ±40 Tmol a year. Recently SaSIT genes of the freshwater araphid pennate diatom Synedra acus subsp. radians are found to be present in the genome as a cluster of two structural genes (SaSIT-TD and SaSIT-TRI) encoding several concatenated copies of a SIT protein each. These structural genes could potentially be transformed into ""mature"" SIT proteins by means of posttranslational proteolytic cleavage. In the present study, we discovered three similar structural SuSIT genes in the genome of a closely related freshwater diatom Synedra ulna subsp. danica. Structural gene SuSIT1 is identical to structural gene SuSIT2, and the two are connected by a non-coding nucleotide DNA sequence. All the putative ""mature"" SITs contain conserved amino acid motifs, which are believed to be important in silicon transport. The data obtained suggest that the predicted ""mature"" SIT proteins may be the minimal units necessary for the transport of silicon is S. ulna subsp. danica. The comparative analysis of all available multi-SITs has allowed us to detect two conservative motifs YQXDXVYL and DXDID, located between the ""mature"" proteins. Aspartic acid-rich DXDID motif can, in our opinion, serve as a proteolysis site during the multi-SIT cleavage. The narrow distribution of the distances between CMLD and DXDID motifs can serve as additional evidence to the conservation of their function."
https://openalex.org/W2889418810,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. Here we have investigated in vitro efficacy of BAMLET and BLAGLET complexes (anti-cancer complexes consisting of oleic acid and bovine α-lactalbumin or β-lactoglobulin respectively) in killing mesothelioma cells, determined BAMLET and BLAGLET structures, and investigated possible biological mechanisms. We performed cell viability assays on 16 mesothelioma cell lines. BAMLET and BLAGLET having increasing oleic acid content inhibited human and rat mesothelioma cell line proliferation at decreasing doses. Most of the non-cancer primary human fibroblasts were more resistant to BAMLET than were human mesothelioma cells. BAMLET showed similar cytotoxicity to cisplatin-resistant, pemetrexed-resistant, vinorelbine-resistant, and parental rat mesothelioma cells, indicating the BAMLET anti-cancer mechanism may be different to drugs currently used to treat mesothelioma. Cisplatin, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and BAMLET, did not demonstrate a therapeutic window for mesothelioma compared with immortalised non-cancer mesothelial cells. We demonstrated by quantitative PCR that ATP synthase is downregulated in mesothelioma cells in response to regular dosing with BAMLET. We sought structural insight for BAMLET and BLAGLET activity by performing small angle X-ray scattering, circular dichroism, and scanning electron microscopy. Our results indicate the structural mechanism by which BAMLET and BLAGLET achieve increased cytotoxicity by holding increasing amounts of oleic acid in an active cytotoxic state encapsulated in increasingly unfolded protein. Our structural studies revealed similarity in the molecular structure of the protein components of these two complexes and in their encapsulation of the fatty acid, and differences in the microscopic structure and structural stability. BAMLET forms rounded aggregates and BLAGLET forms long fibre-like aggregates whose aggregation is more stable than that of BAMLET due to intermolecular disulphide bonds. The results reported here indicate that BAMLET and BLAGLET may be effective second-line treatment options for mesothelioma."
https://openalex.org/W2888781140,"Although modern fluorescence microscopy produces detailed three-dimensional (3D) datasets, colocalization analysis and region of interest (ROI) selection is most commonly performed two-dimensionally (2D) using maximum intensity projections (MIP). However, these 2D projections exclude much of the available data. Furthermore, 2D ROI selections cannot adequately select complex 3D structures which may inadvertently lead to either the exclusion of relevant or the inclusion of irrelevant data points, consequently affecting the accuracy of the colocalization analysis. Using a virtual reality (VR) enabled system, we demonstrate that 3D visualization, sample interrogation and analysis can be achieved in a highly controlled and precise manner. We calculate several key colocalization metrics using both 2D and 3D derived super-resolved structured illumination-based data sets. Using a neuronal injury model, we investigate the change in colocalization between Tau and acetylated α-tubulin at control conditions, after 6 hours and again after 24 hours. We demonstrate that performing colocalization analysis in 3D enhances its sensitivity, leading to a greater number of statistically significant differences than could be established when using 2D methods. Moreover, by carefully delimiting the 3D structures under analysis using the 3D VR system, we were able to reveal a time dependent loss in colocalization between the Tau and microtubule network as an early event in neuronal injury. This behavior could not be reliably detected using a 2D based projection. We conclude that, using 3D colocalization analysis, biologically relevant samples can be interrogated and assessed with greater precision, thereby better exploiting the potential of fluorescence-based image analysis in biomedical research."

The present study aimed to identify the genetic parameters underlying body size and the timing at metamorphosis from leptocephali to glass eels in captive-bred Japanese eels, with the intent to foster sustainable development. Larvae from a partly factorial cross (14 sires × 11 dams) were reared until the point of metamorphosis into glass eels. In these organisms, we observed moderate heritability and mild genetic correlations among traits related to body size (h2 = 0.16–0.33) and timing at metamorphosis (h2 = 0.36–0.41). In an F1 full-sib family, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for these traits identified one significant (genome-wide P < 0.05) and five suggestive QTLs (chromosome-wide P < 0.05). These results suggest that in the Japanese eel, metamorphic traits exhibit a polygenic genetic structure comprising many QTLs with small effects. In addition, we updated the genetic linkage map for the Japanese eel and integrated it with our newly constructed de novo genome assembly. The information and tools generated from this study will contribute to the development of freshwater eel genetics and genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2889142244,"Background Abnormal aggregation of proteins induces neuronal cell loss in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and Parkinson’s Disease. Specific stimuli initialize conformational changes in physiological proteins, causing intra- or extracellular protein aggregation. We and other groups have identified naturally occurring autoantibodies (nAbs) as part of the human antibody pool that are able to prevent peptide fibrillation. These nAbs show a rescue effect following exposure of toxic aggregates on neurons, and they support microglial uptake of aggregated peptides. Objective Identification of a putative common epitope among the relevant proteins β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein and Prion Protein for the respective nAbs. Material and methods Binding affinity between the aforementioned proteins and nAbs was tested by Dot Blot, ELISA and SPR-technology. Furthermore, the functionality of the protein-nAbs-complexes was studied in Thioflavin-T assays and microglial uptake experiments to study dependent inhibition of protein aggregation and enhancement of Fcγ mediated uptake by microglial cells. Results β-Amyloid and Prion Protein fragment showed considerable binding affinity and functional efficacy for all applied nAbs. Thereby, no significant difference within the different nAbs was detected. In contrast, α-Synuclein was bound exclusively by nAbs-α-Synuclein, which was reproduced in all binding studies. Surprisingly, functional assays with α-Synuclein revealed no significant effect of nAbs in comparison to IVIg treatment. However, all applied nAbs as well as IVIg show a minimal functionality on the microglial uptake of α-Synuclein. Conclusion nAbs-Aβ, nAbs-PrP possibly display comparable affinity to the same structural epitope within Aβ and PrP106-126 A117V whereas the epitope recognized by nAbs-α-Syn is only present in α-Syn. The structural similarity of Aβ and PrP fragment promotes the outline for an efficient antibody for the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders and extend the functional characteristics of the investigated nAbs."
https://openalex.org/W2889453301,"Asymmetry in forelimb dorsal hoof wall angles, termed unevenness, is associated with forelimb gait asymmetries, but compensatory mechanisms and out of plane ground reaction forces (GRFs) due to unevenness have yet to be documented. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effects of fore hoof unevenness on contralateral fore and hind limb force vectors patterns, in both sagittal and frontal planes. A group of n = 34 riding horses were classified into four groups: hoof angle difference of more than 1.5 degrees (UNEVEN; n = 27), including higher left fore (HIGH-LF; n = 12), higher right fore (HIGH-RF; n = 15), and hoof angle difference of less than 1.5 degrees (EVEN; n = 7). Three dimensional ground reaction forces GRFs were collected during trotting. GRF summary vectors representing the magnitude (VecMag) and angular direction (VecAng) of the entire stance phase in the sagittal and the frontal plane were calculated. The effects of unevenness on GRF production were explored using linear regression, repeated measures ANOVA and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) with significance at (P<0.05). In all uneven groups, increasing unevenness affected sagittal VecAng values in the forelimbs, with more propulsive GRF in the high hoof. In the HIGH-RF group, medial GRFs were also found in the high RF hoof compared to lateral GRFs in the low LF hoof (RF VecAng: 0.97±1.64 (deg); LF VecAng: -0.64±1.19 (deg); P<0.05). In both HIGH groups, compensatory associations to increasing unevenness were only found in the RH, but also a significantly greater lateral VecAng was found in the LH (P<0.05) compared to the RH limb. No significant differences (P>0.05) were found between hindlimb pairs in the EVEN group. Unbalanced sagittal and increased frontal plane GRFs in uneven horses suggest that they have greater locomotory challenges, as the equine musculoskeletal system is not constructed to withstand movement and loading in the frontal plane as effectively as it is in the sagittal plane."
https://openalex.org/W2888951270,"The increasingly recognised effects of microbiomes on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of their hosts are promoting a view of the “hologenome” as an integral host-symbiont evolutionary entity. For example, sex-ratio distorting reproductive parasites such as Wolbachia are well-studied pivotal drivers of invertebrate reproductive processes, and more recent work is highlighting novel effects of microbiome assemblages on host mating behaviour and developmental incompatibilities that underpin or reinforce reproductive isolation processes. However, examining the hologenome and its eco-evolutionary effects in natural populations is challenging because microbiome composition is considerably influenced by environmental factors. Here we illustrate these challenges in a sympatric species complex of intertidal isopods (Jaera albifrons spp.) with pervasive sex-ratio distortion and ecological and behavioural reproductive isolation mechanisms. We deep-sequence the bacterial 16S rRNA gene among males and females collected in spring and summer from two coasts in north-east Scotland, and examine microbiome composition with a particular focus on reproductive parasites. Microbiomes of all species were diverse (overall 3,317 unique sequences among 3.8 million reads) and comprised mainly Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes taxa typical of the marine intertidal zone, in particular Vibrio spp. However, we found little evidence of the reproductive parasites Wolbachia, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma and Cardinium, suggesting alternative causes of sex-ratio distortion. Notwithstanding, a significant proportion of the variance in microbiome composition among samples was explained by sex (14.1 %), nested within geographic (26.9 %) and seasonal (39.6 %) variance components. The functional relevance of this sex signal was difficult to ascertain given the absence of reproductive parasites, the ephemeral nature of the species assemblages and substantial environmental variability. These results establish the Jaera albifrons species complex as an intriguing system for examining the effects of microbiomes on reproductive processes and speciation, and highlight the difficulties associated with snapshot assays of microbiome composition in dynamic and complex environments."
https://openalex.org/W2888874098,"The study of the telomeric complex in oogenesis and early development is important for understanding the mechanisms which maintain genome integrity. Telomeric transcripts are the key components of the telomeric complex and are essential for regulation of telomere function. We study the biogenesis of transcripts generated by the major Drosophila telomere repeat HeT-A in oogenesis and early development with disrupted telomeric repeat silencing. In wild type ovaries, HeT-A expression is downregulated by the Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). By repressing piRNA pathway, we show that overexpressed HeT-A transcripts interact with their product, RNA-binding protein Gag-HeT-A, forming ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) during oogenesis and early embryonic development. Moreover, during early stages of oogenesis, in the nuclei of dividing cystoblasts, HeT-A RNP form spherical structures, which supposedly represent the retrotransposition complexes participating in telomere elongation. During the later stages of oogenesis, abundant HeT-A RNP are detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the nurse cells, as well as in the cytoplasm of the oocyte. Further on, we demonstrate that HeT-A products co-localize with the transporter protein Egalitarian (Egl) both in wild type ovaries and upon piRNA loss. This finding suggests a role of Egl in the transportation of the HeT-A RNP to the oocyte using a dynein motor. Following germline piRNA depletion, abundant maternal HeT-A RNP interacts with Egl resulting in ectopic accumulation of Egl close to the centrosomes during the syncytial stage of embryogenesis. Given the essential role of Egl in the proper localization of numerous patterning mRNAs, we suggest that its abnormal localization likely leads to impaired embryonic axis specification typical for piRNA pathway mutants."

The striosomes receive afferences from the limbic brain areas and send projections to the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Thereby, it has been suggested that the striosomes exert a limbic control over the motor function mediated by the surrounding matrix. However, the functionality of the striosomes are not completely understood. To elucidate the role of the striosomes on the regulation of the nigral dopamine neurons, we have induced specific ablation of this compartment by striatal injections of the neurotoxin dermorphin-saporin (DS) and dopamine neurotransmission markers have been analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The degeneration of the striosomes resulted in a nigrostriatal projections imbalance between the two striatal compartments, with an increase of the dopamine neurotransmission in the striosomes and a decrease in the matrix. The present results highlight the key function of the striosomes for the maintenance of the striatal dopamine tone and would contribute to the understanding of their involvement in some neurological disorders such as Huntington’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2795493637,"The composition of the scientific workforce shapes the direction of scientific research, directly through the selection of questions to investigate, and indirectly through its influence on the training of future scientists. In most fields, however, complete census information is difficult to obtain, complicating efforts to study workforce dynamics and the effects of policy. This is particularly true in computer science, which lacks a single, all-encompassing directory or professional organization. A full census of computer science would serve many purposes, not the least of which is a better understanding of the trends and causes of unequal representation in computing. Previous academic census efforts have relied on narrow or biased samples, or on professional society membership rolls. A full census can be constructed directly from online departmental faculty directories, but doing so by hand is expensive and time-consuming. Here, we introduce a topical web crawler for automating the collection of faculty information from web-based department rosters, and demonstrate the resulting system on the 205 PhD-granting computer science departments in the U.S. and Canada. This method can quickly construct a complete census of the field, and achieve over 99% precision and recall. We conclude by comparing the resulting 2017 census to a hand-curated 2011 census to quantify turnover and retention in computer science, in general and for female faculty in particular, demonstrating the types of analysis made possible by automated census construction."
https://openalex.org/W2889279961,"Sensorimotor conflict induces both sensory and motor disturbances, but the specific factors playing a role in conflict-induced disturbances are still misunderstood. For example, we still do not know the role played by motor intention (vs. a purely visuo-proprioceptive conflict) or the influence of specific types of incongruent visual feedback. The objective of this study was threefold: 1- to compare the effect of passive and active movement during sensorimotor conflict on sensory disturbances measured with a questionnaire; 2- to compare the effect of three incongruent visual feedback conditions on sensory and motor (mediolateral drift and movement amplitude) disturbances; 3- to test whether conflict-induced sensory and motor disturbances were stable over time. 20 healthy participants realized active or passive cyclic upper limb movements while viewing either congruent or incongruent visual feedback about their movement using a robotized exoskeleton combined with 2D virtual reality interface. First, results showed that in condition of conflict, participants reported higher sensory disturbances during active movements compared to passive movements (p = 0.034), suggesting that the efference copy reinforces the conflict between vision and proprioception. Second, the three conditions of incongruence in the active condition induced similar sensory (all p>0.45) and motor disturbances (medio-lateral drift: all p>0.59 and amplitude: all p>0.25), suggesting that conflict induced motor disturbances could be related more to the observation of another movement rather than to a detection of conflict between motor intention and sensory feedback. Finally, both sensory and motor disturbances were stable over time (all ICCs between 0.76 and 0.87), demonstrating low variability within participants. Overall, our results suggest that the efference copy is more involved in sensory disturbances than in motor disturbances, suggesting that they might rely on independent processes."
https://openalex.org/W2889149681,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease and one of the major causes of disability worldwide. It is a multifactorial disorder with a significant genetic component. The heritability of OA has been estimated to be 60% for hip OA and 39% for knee OA. Genetic factors behind OA are still largely unknown. Studying families with strong history of OA, facilitates examining the co-segregation of genetic variation and OA. The aim of this study was to identify new, rare genetic factors and novel candidate genes for OA.Eight patients from three Finnish families with hip and knee OA were studied using whole exome sequencing. We focused on rare exonic variants with predicted pathogenicity and variants located in active promoter or strong enhancer regions. Expression of identified candidate genes were studied in bone and cartilage tissues and the observed variants were investigated using bioinformatic analyses.Two rare variants co-segregated with OA in two families. In Family 8 a missense variant (c.628C>G, p.Arg210Gly) was observed in the OLIG3 gene that encodes a transcription factor known to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory polyarthritis. The Arg210Gly variant was estimated to be pathogenic by Polyphen-2 and Mutation taster and the locus is conserved among mammals. In Family 12 the observed variant (c.-127G>T) was located in the transcription start site of the FIP1L1 gene. FIP1L1 participates in the regulation of polyadenylation. The c.-127G>T is located in the transcription start site and may alter the DNA-binding of transcription factors. Both, OLIG3 and FIP1L1 were observed in human bone and cartilage.The identified variants revealed novel candidate genes for OA. OLIG3 and FIP1L1 have specific roles in transcription and may effect expression of other genes. Identified variants in these genes may thus have a role in the regulatory events leading to OA."
https://openalex.org/W2889394299,"Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) could be present not only in the posterior pole but extramacular area also as a confluent morphological pattern. Thus RPD can be classified by the fundus distribution for the assessment of visual prognosis. The electrophysiological function in eyes with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), showing various fundus distribution were evaluated using full-field electroretinogram (ERG). Retinal distribution of RPD was divided into three types (localized, intermediate, and diffuse) according to the extent of involvement of retinal areas by fundus photograph montages. RPD were present with the diffuse type in 21 eyes (25.6%), with the intermediate type in 30 eyes (36.6%), and with the localized type in 31 eyes (37.8%). The average age was 74.76 ± 4.52 (range, 65-81) years in the diffuse type, 72.47 ± 9.13 (range, 55-91) years in the intermediate type, and 70.26 ± 7.77 (range, 61-89) years in the localized type. The mean amplitudes of the scotopic rod response, scotopic maximal combined response, oscillatory potentials (OP), photopic cone response, and 30Hz cone flicker response were more decreased in the diffuse, intermediate, and localized types in order, except for the photopic cone a-wave response. The diffuse type showed reduced amplitudes of ERG responses than the normal control group under all testing conditions except for the photopic a-wave response, and differences were statistically significant with the age restriction and adjustment methods (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05). The mean implicit times of ERG responses were significantly delayed in the diffuse type in the photopic b-wave. (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05). Extensive retinal involvement of RPD correlates with severely reduced electrophysiological retinal function. This acquired form of decreased electrophysiological function should be regarded as different from those of hereditary retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2889461902,"A quarter of the world's population is estimated to be infected with Myobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Infection is detected by immune response to M. tuberculosis antigens using either tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release (IGRA's), tests which have low sensitivity in immunocompromised. IL-7 is an important cytokine for T-cell function with potential to augment cytokine release in in-vitro assays. This study aimed to determine whether the addition of IL-7 in interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) improves its diagnostic performance of Mtb infection.44 cases with confirmed TB and 45 household contacts without TB were recruited and 1ml of blood was stimulated in two separate IGRA's tube set: one set of standard Quantiferon TB gold tubes mitogen, TB antigen and TB Nil; one set of customized Quantiferon TB gold tubes with added IL-7. Following IFN-γ and IP-10 release was determined using ELISA.We found that the addition of IL-7 led to significantly higher release of IFN-γ in individuals with active TB from 4.2IU/ml (IQR 1.4-6.9IU/ml) to 5.1IU/ml (IQR 1.5-8.1IU/ml, p = 0.0057), and we found an indication of a lower release of both IFN-γ and IP-10 in participants with negative tests.In TB cases addition of IL-7 in IGRA tubes augments IFN-γ but not IP-10 release, and seems to lower the response in controls. Whether IL-7 boosted IGRA holds potential over standard IGRA needs to be confirmed in larger studies in high and low TB incidence countries."
https://openalex.org/W2888868763,"Disturbances by tourists have been considered to delay the breeding time of coots. In this study, we investigated the common coot (Fulica atra) from April to June in 2008, 2009 and 2012 around the Anbanghe Nature Reserve and Daqing Longfeng wetland of Heilongjiang Province. We evaluated the correlations of four habitat factors (water depth under coots' nests, distance of nests to banks, distance of nests to human disturbance and nest coverage) to discuss the impacts of those factors on the breeding time of the coots. The water depth under the nest was significantly correlated with the coots' breeding stages in the Anbanghe wetland. In addition, we investigated the breeding dates of 56 pairs of coots and found the dates were significantly negatively correlated with the water levels under the nest for both of the wetlands. However, the breeding time (breeding stages and dates) of coots was not significantly related to the distance of the nest to disturbance, distance to the bank of the lake or the nest coverage. The LME models and GAMs that related breeding time to water level received the greatest support. For the GAM, in the group with a clear breeding date, water level was the most influential variable; in the group for which only breeding stages could be recognized, nest coverage combined with water level had a lower AICc value than water depth itself. In conclusion, we found no clear evidence to indicate that disturbances from tourism delayed the breeding time of the coots; however, the water level had a clear influence on the breeding time. We inferred that reproduction was delayed in order to wait for the improvement of habitat conditions (such as food resource and concealment). Neither water level nor disturbance impacted the reproductive output of the coots as these variables showed no clear relationships with the clutch size."

https://openalex.org/W2889002771,"Hemi-ablation of prostate cancer (PCa) requires an accurate prediction of laterality. Recently, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has recently been increasingly used to enhance clinical staging and characterization of tumor foci. Thus, we tried to investigate the real-life accuracy of combinatory approach of using both transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostatic biopsy and mpMRI in predicting the laterality of PCa. We reviewed the records of 335 men who were suspected of having unilateral PCa on multi (≥ 12)-core TRUS-guided biopsy and preoperative mpMRI and subsequently had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution. Based on the analysis of pathologic outcomes from RP, the performance of the combinatory approach in predicting the pathological laterality of PCa was evaluated. Pathology was classified to be unfavorable when showing a Gleason pattern of 4/5 or pT3/N1 features. Significant cancer was defined as non-organ-confined disease, having a Gleason pattern of 4/5, or showing a cancer volume of ≥ 0.5 mL. Among the 335 unilateral lobes not suspected to harbor tumor from either the TRUS biopsy or mpMRI, the actual absence rate of malignancy was only 13.7% from a pathologic analysis of RP specimens. Even among the 115 D'Amico low-risk group, the absence rate of malignancy was only 26.1% in unilateral lobes not suspected to harbor tumor. Among the 335 lobes, unfavorable pathology and significant cancer were not observed in 36.1% and 30.7%, respectively. The absence rates of unfavorable pathology and significant cancer among the D'Amico low risk group were 56.5% and 47.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, the absence rate of dominant Gleason pattern 4 or 5 was 74.9% among the 335 total subjects. Our real-life clinical experience showed that the combination of multi-core TRUS-guided biopsy and mpMRI did not provide reliable accuracy in the prediction of true unilaterality of PCa."
