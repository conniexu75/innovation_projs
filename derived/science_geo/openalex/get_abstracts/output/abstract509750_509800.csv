https://openalex.org/W1975643185,"Naive embryonic stem cells hold great promise for research and therapeutics as they have broad and robust developmental potential. While such cells are readily derived from mouse blastocysts it has not been possible to isolate human equivalents easily, although human naive-like cells have been artificially generated (rather than extracted) by coercion of human primed embryonic stem cells by modifying culture conditions or through transgenic modification. Here we show that a sub-population within cultures of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) manifests key properties of naive state cells. These naive-like cells can be genetically tagged, and are associated with elevated transcription of HERVH, a primate-specific endogenous retrovirus. HERVH elements provide functional binding sites for a combination of naive pluripotency transcription factors, including LBP9, recently recognized as relevant to naivety in mice. LBP9-HERVH drives hESC-specific alternative and chimaeric transcripts, including pluripotency-modulating long non-coding RNAs. Disruption of LBP9, HERVH and HERVH-derived transcripts compromises self-renewal. These observations define HERVH expression as a hallmark of naive-like hESCs, and establish novel primate-specific transcriptional circuitry regulating pluripotency."

https://openalex.org/W1999310024,"Endothelial cells contribute to a subset of cardiac fibroblasts by undergoing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, but whether cardiac fibroblasts can adopt an endothelial cell fate and directly contribute to neovascularization after cardiac injury is not known. Here, using genetic fate map techniques, we demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts rapidly adopt an endothelial-cell-like phenotype after acute ischaemic cardiac injury. Fibroblast-derived endothelial cells exhibit anatomical and functional characteristics of native endothelial cells. We show that the transcription factor p53 regulates such a switch in cardiac fibroblast fate. Loss of p53 in cardiac fibroblasts severely decreases the formation of fibroblast-derived endothelial cells, reduces post-infarct vascular density and worsens cardiac function. Conversely, stimulation of the p53 pathway in cardiac fibroblasts augments mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition, enhances vascularity and improves cardiac function. These observations demonstrate that mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition contributes to neovascularization of the injured heart and represents a potential therapeutic target for enhancing cardiac repair. This study shows that cardiac injury induces cardiac fibroblasts to undergo mesenchymal–endothelial transition and acquire an endothelial-cell like fate, a process mediated, in part, by a p53-dependent mechanism — use of a small molecule activator of p53 increases mesenchymal–endothelial transition, leading to reduced scarring and better preservation of heart function. Cardiac fibroblasts are thought to be terminally differentiated cells. Arjun Deb and colleagues now show that cardiac injury prompts these fibroblasts to undergo mesenchymal–endothelial transition (MEndoT) and acquire endothelial-cell-like fate, a process mediated, in part, via a p53-dependent mechanism. They find that decreasing MEndoT by p53 deletion leads to reduced vascular density after ischaemic injury and worsened heart function. Conversely, use of a small-molecule activator of p53 increases MEndoT, leading to better preservation of heart function and reduced scarring."
https://openalex.org/W2163882745,"The most important energy development of the past decade has been the wide deployment of hydraulic fracturing technologies that enable the production of previously uneconomic shale gas resources in North America. If these advanced gas production technologies were to be deployed globally, the energy market could see a large influx of economically competitive unconventional gas resources. The climate implications of such abundant natural gas have been hotly debated. Some researchers have observed that abundant natural gas substituting for coal could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Others have reported that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with shale gas production make its lifecycle emissions higher than those of coal. Assessment of the full impact of abundant gas on climate change requires an integrated approach to the global energy-economy-climate systems, but the literature has been limited in either its geographic scope or its coverage of greenhouse gases. Here we show that market-driven increases in global supplies of unconventional natural gas do not discernibly reduce the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions or climate forcing. Our results, based on simulations from five state-of-the-art integrated assessment models of energy-economy-climate systems independently forced by an abundant gas scenario, project large additional natural gas consumption of up to +170 per cent by 2050. The impact on CO2 emissions, however, is found to be much smaller (from -2 per cent to +11 per cent), and a majority of the models reported a small increase in climate forcing (from -0.3 per cent to +7 per cent) associated with the increased use of abundant gas. Our results show that although market penetration of globally abundant gas may substantially change the future energy system, it is not necessarily an effective substitute for climate change mitigation policy."
https://openalex.org/W1983768225,"Human Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a β-galactoside-binding protein expressed by tumor cells, has been reported to act as an immune regulator in antitumor T cells. However, its effect on natural killer (NK) cells is elusive. Using a recombinant human NK cell-activating receptor, NKp30 fusion protein (NKp30-Fc), we found that soluble NKp30-Fc could immunoprecipitate Galectin-3. The direct interaction between NKp30 and Galectin-3 was further confirmed using surface plasmon resonance experiments. Because Galectin-3 was mainly released from tumor cells in a soluble form in our study, the binding assay was performed to show that soluble Galectin-3 specifically bound to NK cells and NKp30 on the surface of the NK cells. Functionally, when soluble Galectin-3 was added to the NK-tumor cell coculture system, the NKp30-mediated, but not NKG2D-mediated, cytolysis and CD107a expression in the NK cells were inhibited, and these phenotypes could be restored by preincubation of soluble Galectin-3 with NKp30-Fc fusion protein or the addition of anti-Gal-3 antibody alone. Moreover, genetic down-regulation of Galectin-3 (shGal-3) resulted in tumor cells being more sensitive to NK cell lysis, and, reversely, Galectin-3-overexpressing HeLa cells (exGal-3) became less sensitive to NK cell killing. The results of these in vitro experiments were supported by studies in shGal-3-HeLa or exGal-3-HeLa xenograft non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice after NK cell adoptive immunotherapy, indicating that Galectin-3 strongly antagonizes human NK cell attack against tumors in vivo. These findings indicate that Galectin-3 may function as an immune regulator to inhibit NK cell function against tumors, therefore providing a new therapeutic target for tumor treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2061458636,"Farm animal welfare has been gradually recognized as an important issue in most parts of the world. In China, domestic animals were traditionally raised in backyard and treated as an important component of family wealth. Industrialization of animal production brings forth the farm animal welfare concerns recently in China, yet the modern concept of animal welfare has not been publicized and a comprehensive recognition on how consumers and farmers perceive animal welfare is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a survey on public opinions toward farm animal welfare in China, based on pigs (including sows, piglets, and fattening pigs), domestic fowls (including layers and broilers) and their products. From 6,006 effective questionnaires approximately two thirds of the respondents had never heard of 'animal welfare'; 72.9% of the respondents claimed that, for the sake of animal derived food safety, human beings should improve the rearing conditions for pigs and domestic fowls; 65.8% of the respondents totally or partly agreed on establishing laws to improve animal welfare; more than half of the respondents were willing, or to some extent willing, to pay more for high-welfare animal products, whereas 45.5% of the respondents were not willing or reluctant to pay more. In summary, farm animal welfare is still in its early stage of development and more efforts are needed to improve the public conception to animal welfare in the process of establishing farm animal welfare standards and legislations in China."

Pro- and anti-apoptotic members of this family keep each other in check until the correct time to commit to apoptosis. The point of no return for this commitment is the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Translocation of the pro-apoptotic member, Bax, from the cytosol to the mitochondria is the molecular signature of this event. We employed a novel method to reliably detect Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between pairs of fluorophores to identify intra-molecular conformational changes and inter-molecular contacts in Bax as this translocation occurs in live cells. In the cytosol, our FRET measurement indicated that the C-terminal helix is exposed instead of tucked away in the core of the protein. In addition fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) showed that cytosolic Bax diffuses much slower than expected, suggesting possible complex formation or transient membrane interaction. Cross-linking the C-terminal helix (α9) to helix α4 reduced the potential of those interactions to occur. After translocation, our FRET measurements showed that Bax molecules form homo-oligomers in the mitochondria through two distinct interfaces involving the BH3 domain (helix α2) and the C-terminal helix. These findings have implications for possible contacts with other Bcl-2 proteins necessary for the regulation of apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2039365630,"Ebola virus is from the Filoviridae family of viruses and is one of the most virulent pathogens known with ∼ 60% clinical fatality. The Ebola virus negative sense RNA genome encodes seven proteins including viral matrix protein 40 (VP40), which is the most abundant protein found in the virions. Within infected cells VP40 localizes at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), binds lipids, and regulates formation of new virus particles. Expression of VP40 in mammalian cells is sufficient to form virus-like particles that are nearly indistinguishable from the authentic virions. However, how VP40 interacts with the PM and forms virus-like particles is for the most part unknown. To investigate VP40 lipid specificity in a model of viral egress we employed giant unilamellar vesicles with different lipid compositions. The results demonstrate VP40 selectively induces vesiculation from membranes containing phosphatidylserine (PS) at concentrations of PS that are representative of the PM inner leaflet content. The formation of intraluminal vesicles was not significantly detected in the presence of other important PM lipids including cholesterol and polyvalent phosphoinositides, further demonstrating PS selectivity. Taken together, these studies suggest that PM phosphatidylserine may be an important component of Ebola virus budding and that VP40 may be able to mediate PM scission."
https://openalex.org/W1972646454,"Therapeutic strategies designed to inhibit the activation of microglia may lead to significant advancement in the treatment of most neurodegenerative diseases. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a naturally occurring redox cofactor that acts as an essential nutrient, antioxidant, and has been reported to exert potent immunosuppressive effects. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of PQQ was investigated in LPS treated primary microglia cells. Our observations showed that pretreatment with PQQ significantly inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 and suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS, COX-2, TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-1a in LPS treated primary microglia cells. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the phosphorylation level of p65, p38 and JNK MAP kinase pathways were also inhibited by PQQ in LPS stimulated primary microglia cells. Further a systemic LPS treatment acute inflammation murine brain model was used to study the suppressive effects of PQQ against neuroinflammation in vivo. Mice treated with PQQ demonstrated marked attenuation of neuroinflammation based on Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis of Iba1-against antibody in the brain tissue. Indicated that PQQ protected primary cortical neurons against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. These results collectively suggested that PQQ might be a promising therapeutic agent for alleviating the progress of neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglia activation."
https://openalex.org/W1973901840,"Plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) constitute large multigene families that possess complex physiological functions, many of which remain unclear. This study isolated and characterized the function of a lipid transfer protein gene, BraLTP1 from Brassica rapa, in the important oilseed crops Brassica napus. BraLTP1 encodes a predicted secretory protein, in the little known VI Class of nsLTP families. Overexpression of BnaLTP1 in B. napus caused abnormal green coloration and reduced wax deposition on leaves and detailed wax analysis revealed 17-80% reduction in various major wax components, which resulted in significant water-loss relative to wild type. BnaLTP1 overexpressing leaves exhibited morphological disfiguration and abaxially curled leaf edges, and leaf cross-sections revealed cell overproliferation that was correlated to increased cytokinin levels (tZ, tZR, iP, and iPR) in leaves and high expression of the cytokinin biosynthsis gene IPT3. BnaLTP1-overexpressing plants also displayed morphological disfiguration of flowers, with early-onset and elongated carpel development and outwardly curled stamen. This was consistent with altered expression of a a number of ABC model genes related to flower development. Together, these results suggest that BraLTP1 is a new nsLTP gene involved in wax production or deposition, with additional direct or indirect effects on cell division and flower development."
https://openalex.org/W2022722866,"Background The coupling of biotic and abiotic stresses leads to high yield losses in rainfed rice (Oryza sativa L.) growing areas. While several studies target these stresses independently, breeding strategies to combat multiple stresses seldom exist. This study reports an integrated strategy that combines QTL mapping and phenotypic selection to develop rice lines with high grain yield (GY) under drought stress and non-stress conditions, and tolerance of rice blast. Methodology A blast-tolerant BC2F3-derived population was developed from the cross of tropical japonica cultivar Moroberekan (blast- and drought-tolerant) and high-yielding indica variety Swarna (blast- and drought-susceptible) through phenotypic selection for blast tolerance at the BC2F2 generation. The population was studied for segregation distortion patterns and QTLs for GY under drought were identified along with study of epistatic interactions for the trait. Results Segregation distortion, in favour of Moroberekan, was observed at 50 of the 59 loci. Majority of these marker loci co-localized with known QTLs for blast tolerance or NBS-LRR disease resistance genes. Despite the presence of segregation distortion, high variation for DTF, PH and GY was observed and several QTLs were identified under drought stress and non-stress conditions for the three traits. Epistatic interactions were also detected for GY which explained a large proportion of phenotypic variance observed in the population. Conclusions This strategy allowed us to identify QTLs for GY along with rapid development of high-yielding purelines tolerant to blast and drought with considerably reduced efforts. Apart from this, it also allowed us to study the effects of the selection cycle for blast tolerance. The developed lines were screened at IRRI and in the target environment, and drought and blast tolerant lines with high yield were identified. With tolerance to two major stresses and high yield potential, these lines may provide yield stability in rainfed rice areas."
https://openalex.org/W1977315244,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) despite being increasingly used as a method for microbial identification, still present limitations in which concerns the differentiation of closely related species. Bacillus pumillus and Bacillus safensis, are species of biotechnological and pharmaceutical significance, difficult to differentiate by conventional methodologies. In this study, using a well-characterized collection of B. pumillus and B. safensis isolates, we demonstrated the suitability of MALDI-TOF-MS combined with chemometrics to accurately and rapidly identify them. Moreover, characteristic species-specific ion masses were tentatively assigned, using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL databases and primary literature. Delineation of B. pumilus (ions at m/z 5271 and 6122) and B. safensis (ions at m/z 5288, 5568 and 6413) species were supported by a congruent characteristic protein pattern. Moreover, using a chemometric approach, the score plot created by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) of mass spectra demonstrated the presence of two individualized clusters, each one enclosing isolates belonging to a species-specific spectral group. The generated pool of species-specific proteins comprised mostly ribosomal and SASPs proteins. Therefore, in B. pumilus the specific ion at m/z 5271 was associated with a small acid-soluble spore protein (SASP O) or with 50S protein L35, whereas in B. safensis specific ions at m/z 5288 and 5568 were associated with SASP J and P, respectively, and an ion at m/z 6413 with 50S protein L32. Thus, the resulting unique protein profile combined with chemometric analysis, proved to be valuable tools for B. pumilus and B. safensis discrimination, allowing their reliable, reproducible and rapid identification."

The only vaccine available, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), has been used since its inception in 1921. Although BCG induces host-protective T helper 1 (Th1) cell immune responses, which play a central role in host protection, its efficacy is unsatisfactory, suggesting that additional methods to enhance protective immune responses are needed. Recently we have shown that simultaneous inhibition of Th2 cells and Tregs by using the pharmacological inhibitors suplatast tosylate and D4476, respectively, dramatically enhances Mycobacterium tuberculosis clearance and induces superior Th1 responses. Here we show that treatment with these two drugs during BCG vaccination dramatically improves vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these drugs induce a shift in the development of T cell memory, favoring central memory T (Tcm) cell responses over effector memory T (Tem) cell responses.

Pio A. Evolution of WHO policies for tuberculosis control, 1948–2001.Lancet. 2002; 359: 775-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). One-third of the global population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, waiting for the opportunity of perturbations in the immune response such as those induced by HIV infection (2WHO global tuberculosis control report. Summary (2010) Cent. Eur. J. Public Health 18, 237.Google Scholar) for reactivation. Thus, the vast reservoir for TB disease is alarming, and its epidemic is becoming a global public health emergency. Unfortunately, cost-effective and user-friendly therapy of TB is long overdue. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only TB vaccine presently available. It has been widely used throughout the world since its inception in 1921, and an estimated three billion people have received it. BCG is effective against disseminated and meningeal tuberculosis in young children. However, its efficacy against adult pulmonary TB varied dramatically between 0 and 80% in different populations depending on ethnicity and geographical locality (3Colditz G.A. Brewer T.F. Berkey C.S.

Meta-analysis of the published literature.JAMA. 1994; 271: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that BCG-vaccinated animals mainly develop antigen-specific, CD4+ T cell effector memory (Tem) cells. Therefore, an apparent failure of BCG to induce significant numbers of central memory T (Tcm) cells may be an important contributing factor to its limited vaccine efficacy (4Henao-Tamayo M.I. Ordway D.J. Irwin S.M. Shang S. Shanley C. Orme I.M. Phenotypic definition of effector and memory T-lymphocyte subsets in mice chronically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Clin.

It is well known that M. tuberculosis survives and replicates within host cells by modulating T helper (Th) cell responses. Studies with patients and animal models have indicated that T cells are indispensable for anti-TB immunity. Resistant individuals mount M. tuberculosis antigen-specific Th1 responses, as determined by preferential T cell production of IFN-γ, lymphotoxin, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (5Goldsack L. Kirman J.R. Half-truths and selective memory: interferon γ, CD4(+) T cells and protective memory against tuberculosis.Tuberculosis. 2007; 87: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, individuals defective in genes for IFN-γ or the IFN-γ receptor are highly susceptible to TB (6Ottenhoff T.H. Kumararatne D. Casanova J.L. Novel human immunodeficiencies reveal the essential role of type-I cytokines in immunity to intracellular bacteria.Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 491-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Animal models of TB confirmed that M. tuberculosis-specific Th1 cells are indispensable for elimination of tubercle bacilli from the host (7Flynn J.L. Chan J. Triebold K.J. Dalton D.K. Stewart T.A. Bloom B.R. An essential role for interferon γ in resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). However, several studies have provided evidence that Th1 responses alone are not sufficient for protection against TB (8Bhattacharyya S. Singla R. Dey A.B. Prasad H.K. Dichotomy of cytokine profiles in patients and high-risk healthy subjects exposed to tuberculosis.Infect Immun. 1999; 67: 5597-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse strains with enhanced susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection induce progressive Th2 responses predominated by production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (9Rook G.A. Th2 cytokines in susceptibility to tuberculosis.Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, Th2 responses might contribute to enhanced susceptibility to TB. This hypothesis was strengthened by the finding that IL-4-deficient mice are resistant to M. tuberculosis infection (10North R.J. Mice incapable of making IL-4 or IL-10 display normal resistance to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 113: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies investigating the expression of cytokines in human granulomas of patients with advanced TB revealed increased IL-4 production (11Fenhalls G. Wong A. Bezuidenhout J. van Helden P. Bardin P. Lukey P.T. In situ production of γ interferon, interleukin-4, and tumor necrosis factor α mRNA in human lung tuberculous granulomas.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2827-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, elevated Th2 responses have been noted in patients who failed to be protected from TB after BCG vaccination (12Dlugovitzky D. Bottasso O. Dominino J.C. Valentini E. Hartopp R. Singh M. Stanford C. Stanford J. Clinical and serological studies of tuberculosis patients in Argentina receiving immunotherapy with Mycobacterium vaccae (SRL 172).Respir. Med. 1999; 93: 557-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless it is clear that susceptibility to TB is not limited to individuals with enhanced Th2 cell responses. Another T cell subset, T regulatory (Treg) cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells), is expanded during the progression of TB and contributes to disease susceptibility (13Scott-Browne J.P. Shafiani S. Tucker-Heard G. Ishida-Tsubota K. Fontenot J.D. Rudensky A.Y. Bevan M.J. Urdahl K.B. Expansion and function of Foxp3-expressing T regulatory cells during tuberculosis.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2159-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Antigen-specific Treg cells increased within 3 weeks of infection and were associated with an environment that increased bacterial burden (14Shafiani S. Dinh C. Ertelt J.M. Moguche A.O. Siddiqui I. Smigiel K.S. Sharma P. Campbell D.J. Way S.S. Urdahl K.B. Pathogen-specific Treg cells expand early during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection but are later eliminated in response to interleukin-12.Immunity. 2013; 38: 1261-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and inhibited the development of protective Th1 responses. Although the precise cytokine requirements for the differentiation of Treg cells remain unclear, it has been established that expression of the forkhead transcription factor FoxP3 is inducible by TGF-β. In a recent study we demonstrated that mice unable to mount Th2 and Treg cell responses (i.e. Stat-6−/−CD4-TGFβRIIDN mice) are highly resistant to M. tuberculosis infection (15Bhattacharya D. Dwivedi V.P. Maiga M. Maiga M. Van Kaer L. Bishai W.R. Das G. Small molecule-directed immunotherapy against recurrent infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16508-16515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We further validated these data by small molecule-directed immunotherapy using suplatast tosylate ([3-[[4-(3-ehoxy-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]amino]-3oxopropyl]dimethylsulfonium 4-methylbenzenesulfonate) and D4476 (4-[4-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-5-(2-pyridinyl)-1H-imiodazol-2-yl]benzamide), which inhibit Th2 and Treg cell differentiation, respectively. Combined treatment with these agents rapidly decreased the bacterial burden in mice. This was associated with increased Th1 cell responses, as shown by a dramatic increase in IFN-γ-producing cells with a moderate increase in IL-17-producing cells and by the finding that this therapeutic regimen was not effective in T-bet-deficient animals that are unable to produce Th1 type immune responses (15Bhattacharya D. Dwivedi V.P. Maiga M. Maiga M. Van Kaer L. Bishai W.R. Das G. Small molecule-directed immunotherapy against recurrent infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16508-16515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that combined inhibition of Th2 and Treg cell differentiation promotes protective immune responses in the host, which is in agreement with the concept that Th1 cells are necessary and sufficient for resistance against TB (16Sweeney K.A. Dao D.N. Goldberg M.F. Hsu T. Venkataswamy M.M. Henao-Tamayo M. Ordway D. Sellers R.S. Jain P. Chen B. Chen M. Kim J. Lukose R. Chan J. Orme I.M. Porcelli S.A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. A recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis induces potent bactericidal immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As these compounds enhance host-protective immune responses, which successfully eliminate the harbored M. tuberculosis organisms, it is likely that this therapeutic modality induces long-lasting protective memory responses in the host. These findings suggested that mounting Th1 responses while inhibiting Th2 and Treg responses should be beneficial in developing TB vaccines. We, therefore, tested this hypothesis using BCG. Our results showed that simultaneous inhibition of Th2 and Treg cell differentiation enhances the efficacy of BCG vaccination, which was associated with enhanced Th1 responses. Recent studies have indicated that attenuation of Tregs during BCG immunization increases the efficacy of BCG by enhancing the production of Th1 responses (17Jaron B. Maranghi E. Leclerc C. Majlessi L. Effect of attenuation of Treg during BCG immunization on anti-mycobacterial Th1 responses and protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies suggested that the presence of IL-4 in the microenvironment corrupts the Th1 immune response (18da Fonseca D.M. Silva C.L. Wowk P.F. Paula M.O. Ramos S.G. Horn C. Marchal G. Bonato V.L. Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides confer protection to Mycobacterium bovis BCG-primed mice by inhibiting interleukin-4 secretion.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These authors also provided evidence that increased IFN-γ and IL-17 concentrations by means of inhibition of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 improve BCG vaccine efficacy. Here we have showed that inhibition of Th2 cells and Tregs promotes host-protective Th1 responses and thereby enhances BCG vaccine efficacy. Therefore, we observed a dramatic switch in the memory T cell response toward Tcm cell responses. Consistent with the central role Tcm cells play in host protection and vaccine efficacy, animals treated with these two inhibitors at the time of BCG vaccination exhibited significantly improved protection against M. tuberculosis infection. Therefore, this strategy holds promise for developing improved TB vaccines in humans. BALB/c mice, either Thy1.1+ or Thy1.2+ (6–8 weeks of age), were initially purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All animals were subsequently bred and maintained in the animal facility of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India. Mice were immunized with BCG subcutaneously (1 × 106 bacteria), and starting from the next day these animals were treated with D4476 (TGFβRI inhibitor) and suplatast tosylate (Th2 inhibitor) purchased from Tocris at 16 nmol/g of body weight for a total of 10 days. Mice were subsequently rested for 20 days. Mice were then challenged by the aerosol route with M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv, and organs were harvested for determination of bacterial burden at 60 days after infection. M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (BD Biosciences) containing 0.02% Tween 80 to mid-log phase at 37 °C for 3 weeks, then aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C until use. Viable bacterial number was determined on 7H11 agar plates (BD Biosciences) with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) enrichment (BD Biosciences). Mice were infected via the aerosol route using the nebulizer compartment of an airborne infection apparatus. After 30 min of exposure the deposition of bacteria was ∼110 bacteria/lung, which was determined by plating the lung homogenates after 24 h of infection. The numbers of viable bacteria in the lung, spleen, and liver of different types of mice were followed at regular time intervals by plating serial dilutions of individual organ homogenates onto nutrient Middlebrook 7H11 agar and counting bacterial colony formation after 21 days of incubation at 37 °C. For adoptive transfer experiments, Thy1.1+ mice were γ-irradiated (8 rads/s for 100 s) and rested for 1 day. CD4+ T cells, isolated from the lymph nodes of Thy1.2+ animals, were then adoptively transferred into the irradiated recipient mice (2 × 106 cells per mouse). After 10 days recipient mice were challenged with H37Rv through the aerosol route. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate and 500 ng/ml ionomycin in the presence of 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma) added during the last 6 h of culture. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in a permeabilization buffer (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD Biosciences) and stained with the following fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies: anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5)-APC (eBioscience), anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5)-PE-Cy5 (eBioscience), anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5)-PE (eBioscience), anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5)-FITC (eBioscience), anti-mouse CD8 (clone 53–6.7)-PE-Cy5 (eBioscience), anti-mouse CD44 (clone IM7)-PE (Biolegend), anti-mouse CD62L (clone MPL-14)-APC (eBioscience), anti-mouse CD25 (clone PC61)-APC (Biolegend), anti-mouse IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2)-APC (Biolegend), anti-mouse IL-4 (clone 11B11)-PE (Biolegend), anti-mouse IL-17A (clone TC11–18H10.1)-PE (Biolegend), anti-mouse FoxP3 (clone MF-14)-PE (Biolegend), anti-mouse FoxP3 (clone FJK-16s)-APC (eBioscience), anti-mouse TNF-α (clone MP6-XT22)-PE (Biolegend), anti-mouse IL-6 (clone MP5–20F3)-PE (Biolegend), anti-mouse IL-12 (clone C15.6)-PE (Biolegend), and anti-mouse IL-10 (clone JES5–16E3)-PE (Biolegend). Fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur or FACS CantoII; BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star). Cytokines in the culture supernatant of splenocytes were assayed by a Luminex microbead-based multiplexed assay using commercially available kits according to the manufacturer's protocol (BioPlex, Bio-Rad). All data were derived from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS10 software, and values are presented as the mean ± S.D. Significant differences between the groups were determined by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (SPSS software). A value of p < 0.05 was used as an indication of statistical significance. To examine the effect of Th2 and Treg cell inhibitors on BCG-vaccinated mice, we immunized BALB/c mice with BCG and treated the animals with D4476 and suplatast tosylate, inhibitors of TGFβRI signaling and Th2 cell differentiation, respectively, for 10 days. These animals were subsequently rested for another 20 days and re-infected with M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv through the aerosol route. Organs were harvested, and the bacterial burdens were determined at different time intervals (Fig. 1A). We observed that co-treatment with these compounds drastically enhanced BCG vaccine efficacy, as determined by the significant reduction of bacterial loads in various organs (Fig. 1B). To obtain information regarding potential alterations in immune responses, we challenged spleen cells isolated from mice 60 days after infection with M. tuberculosis-derived complete soluble antigen and measured proliferative responses. We found that splenocytes from animals that received immunomodulators along with BCG exhibited superior proliferative responses (Fig. 1C). Histological studies further revealed that animals treated with immunomodulators along with BCG showed a dramatic reduction in the regions of the lungs containing granulomas (Fig. 1D). To provide insight into the T cell response induced by the immunomodulators in BCG-vaccinated animals, we analyzed T lymphocytes from spleens of different experimental groups of animals. Phenotypic characterization revealed that CD4+ T cells in animals treated with suplatast tosylate and D4476 were increased significantly as compared with mice treated with BCG only (Fig. 2, A and B). Vaccine efficacy is mostly dependent on the pool of Tcm (19Sallusto F. Geginat J. Lanzavecchia A. Central memory and effector memory T cell subsets: function, generation, and maintenance.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 745-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar), whereas BCG primarily induces Tem in lung, which might contribute to the limited efficacy of BCG, providing only short term protection (4Henao-Tamayo M.I. Ordway D.J. Irwin S.M. Shang S. Shanley C. Orme I.M. Phenotypic definition of effector and memory T-lymphocyte subsets in mice chronically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As inhibition of Th2 and Treg cell differentiation with pharmacological inhibitors promoted disease resistance, we determined the relative generation of Tem and Tcm cells in immunized animals. Phenotype analysis revealed that approximately half of all CD4+ T cells in the animals treated with the immunomodulators were CD44hiCD62Lhi, indicating Tcm, which is significantly higher than in any other experimental group (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, the numbers of CD44hiCD62Llo CD4+ T cells, which are the phenotype of Tem, were dramatically decreased in these animals (Fig. 2, C and D). To further determine the functional relevance of these cells, we determined IFN-γ production by these cells. We observed that the CD44hiCD62Lhi cells derived from mice treated with immunomodulators included significantly increased levels of IFN-γ-producing cells (Fig. 2E). To determine whether treatment with suplatast tosylate and D4476 affects immune responses in BCG immunized animals, we next quantified the frequencies of cytokine-producing T cells. Our results demonstrated that IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells were dramatically increased, whereas Th2 cytokine-producing cells were decreased in the animals treated with immunomodulators (Fig. 3, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1). An opposite trend was observed in BCG-immunized animals in the absence of immunomodulators (Fig. 3, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, we were unable to detect changes in Th17 cytokine-producing cells in any experimental group (Fig. 3, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1). Although Th17 responses promote vaccine efficacy (20Chatterjee S. Dwivedi V.P. Singh Y. Siddiqui I. Sharma P. Van Kaer L. Chattopadhyay D. Das G.

Immunol. 2007; 8: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), such responses do not appear to be required for immune protection (22Wareham A.S. Tree J.A. Marsh P.D. Butcher P.D. Dennis M. Sharpe S.A. Evidence for a role for interleukin-17, Th17 cells, and iron homeostasis in protective immunity against tuberculosis in cynomolgus macaques.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e88149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Treg cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of TB, and we, therefore, sought to determine the status of Treg cells in these animals. We observed an abrupt decrease of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells in BCG-vaccinated animals treated with immunomodulators (Fig. 3, B and C). We also determined other host-protective cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α. Previously, IL-6 and TNF-α have been implicated in host resistance against M. tuberculosis (23Cavalcanti Y.V. Brelaz M.C. Neves J.K. Ferraz J.C. Pereira V.R. Role of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-10 in the development of pulmonary tuberculosis.Pulm. Med. 2012; 2012: 745483Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). IL-12 is a Th1-inducing cytokine, and genetic deficiency in IL-12 or its signaling components causes profound susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection. We found that IL-6-, IL-12-, and TNF-α-producing cells were significantly increased in BCG-immunized mice treated with immunomodulators (Fig. 3, D and E). We also examined IL-10 production but were unable to detect any differences (Fig. 3, D and E), which is in agreement with a previous report that IL-10−/− animals are as susceptible as wild type littermates to M. tuberculosis infection (24Erb K.J. Kirman J. Delahunt B. Chen W. Le Gros G. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 are not required for the control of M. bovis-BCG infection in mice.Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To provide further evidence for a critical role of Tcm generated by treatment with immunomodulators during BCG vaccination in resistance to M. tuberculosis infection, we immunized Thy1.2 congenic mice and treated these animals with suplatast tosylate and D4476, isolated CD4+ T cells, and adoptively transferred them into irradiated Thy1.1 congenic animals followed by infection with H37Rv (Fig. 4A). 15, 30, and 60 days after infection we measured the bacterial burden in the lungs and spleens of the mice. Interestingly, we found that recipient animals receiving cells from drug-treated mice displayed significantly reduced bacterial burden than recipients receiving cells from untreated mice (Fig. 4B). These findings suggested that Tcm cells generated by treatment with immunomodulators during BCG vaccination confer protective immunity against M. tuberculosis infection. It is well established that the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α and Th1-associated cytokines play a central role in host protection against M. tuberculosis infection. Therefore, we measured these cytokines in animals that were adoptively transferred with memory T cells and protected from M. tuberculosis infection (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 2). We observed that IFN-γ levels were much higher in the animals that received CD4+ T cells from drug-treated compared with untreated mice, whereas IL-4 levels were very similar (Fig. 5B). We also determined levels of the T cell-polarizing cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IL-10, and TNF-α. We found that IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α levels were higher in the recipient animals that received cells from drug-treated mice (Fig. 5, D and E, and supplemental Fig. 1). Despite enormous efforts, BCG is currently the only available vaccine for prevention of TB. Thus far, none of the vaccine candidates tested in clinical trials have surpassed the efficacy of BCG (25WHO (2006) State of the Art of New Vaccine and Development, pp. 29–33, World Health OrganizationGoogle Scholar). Currently, there are 11 vaccine candidates that are being tested in clinical trials, and 7 of these are subunit booster vaccines (26Andersen P. Woodworth J.S. Tuberculosis vaccines: rethinking the current paradigm.Trends Immunol. 2014; 35: 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Checkley A.M. McShane H. Tuberculosis vaccines: progress and challenges.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2011; 32: 601-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because attenuated microorganisms, at least for bacterial diseases, have been highly successful as vaccines compared with subunit vaccines, recombinant BCG strains might represent promising vaccine candidates. However, none of the recombinant strains tested thus far have exceeded the vaccine efficacy of the parental BCG strain (28Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Frigui W. Valenti P. Dos Santos S. Duthoy S. Lacroix C. Garcia-Pelayo C. Inwald J.K. Golby P. Garcia J.N. Hewinson R.G. Behr M.A. Quail M.A. Churcher C. Barrell B.G. Parkhill J. Cole S.T.

Junqueira-Kipnis A.P. Recombinant BCG: innovations on an old vaccine: scope of BCG strains and strategies to improve long-lasting memory.Front Immunol. 2014; 5: 152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, two recombinant BCG vaccines are being tested in vaccine trials. Both of these recombinants, an Ag85-recombinant and a listeriolysin-recombinant, elicited superior vaccine efficacy than BCG in preclinical animal models (30Ottenhoff T.H.M. Kaufmann S.H.E. Vaccines against tuberculosis: where are we and where do we need to go?.PLoS Pathog. 2012; (0.1371/journal.ppat.1002607)Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Ag85 is an antigenic protein from M. tuberculosis and may contribute to host-protective immune responses, and hence, a booster dose with this antigen may be helpful (31Beamer G.L. Cyktor J. Flaherty D.K. Stromberg P.C. Carruthers B. Turner J. CBA/J mice generate protective immunity to soluble Ag85 but fail to respond efficiently to Ag85 during natural Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42: 870-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 32Russo D.M. Kozlova N. Lakey D.L. Kernodle D. Naive human T cells develop into Th1 effectors after stimulation with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages or recombinant Ag85 proteins.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6826-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, listeriolysin is a membrane-perforating protein responsible for cytosolic translocation of Listeria pathogens, which facilitates MHC class I-restricted antigen processing and induction of cytolytic CD8+ T cells (30Ottenhoff T.H.M. Kaufmann S.H.E. Vaccines against tuberculosis: where are we and where do we need to go?.PLoS Pathog. 2012; (0.1371/journal.ppat.1002607)Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Thus, a BCG recombinant containing listeriolysin would be expected to facilitate escape of the organism (BCG) or leakage of its proteins into the cytosol and induce enhanced CD8+ T cell activation (33Nagata T. Koide Y. Induction of specific CD8 T cells against intracellular bacteria by CD8 T-Cell-oriented immunization approaches.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010: 764542Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We and other research groups have previously shown that M. tuberculosis itself can translocate from endosomal compartments to the cytosol (34Rahman A. Sobia P. Gupta N. Kaer L.V. Das G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis subverts the TLR-2-MyD88 pathway to facilitate its translocation into the cytosol.PloS ONE. 2014; 9: e86886Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35van der Wel N. Hava D. Houben D. Fluitsma D. van Zon M. Pierson J. Brenner M. Peters P.J.

Therefore, introduction of listeriolysin in BCG would induce immune responses that more closely mimic those induced by M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, listeriolysin may induce apoptosis in infected cells, which would facilitate cross-presentation of M. tuberculosis antigens on MHC class I to CD8+ T cells. Such cross-presentation may also induce Th1 and Th17 responses, which are known to contribute to host protection (15Bhattacharya D. Dwivedi V.P. Maiga M. Maiga M. Van Kaer L. Bishai W.R. Das G.

Although the role of CD8+ T cells in immune protection to human TB is still unclear, in vitro studies have suggested that they recognize heavily infected cells, which is consistent with a role of CD8+ T cells in immune surveillance against TB (36Lewinsohn D.A. Heinzel A.S. Gardner J.M. Zhu L. Alderson M.R. Lewinsohn D.M. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD8+ T cells preferentially recognize heavily infected cells.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 1346-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 37Sutherland J.S. Young J.M. Peterson K.L. Sanneh B. Whittle H.C. Rowland-Jones S.L. Adegbola R.A. Jaye A. Ota M.O.

Immunol. 2010; 184: 6537-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Targeting these cells may provide a means to prevent reactivation of latent infection (38Boom W.H. New TB vaccines: is there a requirement for CD8 T cells?.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2092-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, we and other groups of investigators have shown that Th1 and to a lesser extent Th17 cells play important roles in host protection against TB (15Bhattacharya D. Dwivedi V.P. Maiga M. Maiga M. Van Kaer L. Bishai W.R. Das G. Small molecule-directed immunotherapy against recurrent infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16508-16515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Chatterjee S. Dwivedi V.P. Singh Y. Siddiqui I. Sharma P. Van Kaer L. Chattopadhyay D. Das G.

Although BCG effectively induces Th1 responses, it has very limited efficacy against pulmonary TB. Thus, two possibilities might explain the limited vaccine efficacy of BCG. First, BCG may fail to induce an immune response that is critical for optimal host protection. Second, BCG may induce additional immune responses that hinder host-protective immune responses. Recently, we have shown that inhibition of Th2 and Treg cell differentiation by small molecules greatly enhances host-protective immunity (15Bhattacharya D. Dwivedi V.P. Maiga M. Maiga M. Van Kaer L. Bishai W.R. Das G. Small molecule-directed immunotherapy against recurrent infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16508-16515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). BCG similarly induces Th2 and Treg cell responses, and thus may hinder host-protective Th1 and/or Th17 cell responses. Our results reported here have demonstrated that simultaneous inhibition of Th2 cells and Tregs by small molecules potently enhances BCG-induced vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy is governed by the capacity to induce Tcm cells. Indeed, our findings showed that simultaneous inhibition of Th2 and Tregs cells by small molecules enhances host-protective Tcm cell responses, which correlated with enhanced host protection. Furthermore, these observations suggest that Th2 cells and Tregs not only counterbalance host-protective immune responses that facilitate disease progression but also inhibit Tcm, resulting in reduced vaccine efficacy. Our earlier studies showed that simultaneous inhibition of Th2 cells and Tregs during M. tuberculosis infection promotes host-protective immunity, but this was not sufficient to completely eradicate the harbored M. tuberculosis organisms (15Bhattacharya D. Dwivedi V.P. Maiga M. Maiga M. Van Kaer L. Bishai W.R. Das G. Small molecule-directed immunotherapy against recurrent infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16508-16515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, a recombinant BCG vaccine that can induce both Th1 and Th17 responses along with inhibition of Th2 and Treg responses should provide a more optimal vaccine strategy. This hypothesis will be explored in our future investigations. Although BCG vaccination is ineffective against adult pulmonary TB, it is effective in protecting young children against meningeal and disseminated TB. As huge numbers of people have already received BCG, a strategy that selectively enhances Th1 and Th17 responses is highly desired. Our findings together with published studies suggest that BCG vaccine along with inhibition of Th2 and Treg cell differentiation may provide such a strategy.

https://openalex.org/W2135523262,"We report organic and inorganic carbon distributions and fluxes in a large (>2000 km2) oligotrophic, tropical lake (Lake Kivu, East Africa), acquired during four field surveys, that captured the seasonal variations (March 2007–mid rainy season, September 2007–late dry season, June 2008–early dry season, and April 2009–late rainy season). The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in surface waters of the main basin of Lake Kivu showed modest spatial (coefficient of variation between 3% and 6%), and seasonal variations with an amplitude of 163 ppm (between 579±23 ppm on average in March 2007 and 742±28 ppm on average in September 2007). The most prominent spatial feature of the pCO2 distribution was the very high pCO2 values in Kabuno Bay (a small sub-basin with little connection to the main lake) ranging between 11213 ppm and 14213 ppm (between 18 and 26 times higher than in the main basin). Surface waters of the main basin of Lake Kivu were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere at an average rate of 10.8 mmol m−2 d−1, which is lower than the global average reported for freshwater, saline, and volcanic lakes. In Kabuno Bay, the CO2 emission to the atmosphere was on average 500.7 mmol m−2 d−1 (∼46 times higher than in the main basin). Based on whole-lake mass balance of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) bulk concentrations and of its stable carbon isotope composition, we show that the epilimnion of Lake Kivu was net autotrophic. This is due to the modest river inputs of organic carbon owing to the small ratio of catchment area to lake surface area (2.15). The carbon budget implies that the CO2 emission to the atmosphere must be sustained by DIC inputs of geogenic origin from deep geothermal springs."

FADH that is involved in the oxidation of fatty alcohols of more than 10 carbons has remained unidentified in all n-alkane-assimilating yeasts. FAOD activity has been detected in cell extracts of a subset of n-alkane-assimilating yeasts, including C. maltosa, C. bombicola, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and D. hansenii, and coding genes have been characterized in some of these yeasts (24Kemp G.D.

An orthologous gene, however, has not been identified in the genome sequence of Y. lipolytica. It was recently shown that alcohol dehydrogenase genes, FADH and ADH1–ADH7, and a fatty alcohol oxidase gene, FAO1, are involved in the oxidation of ω-hydroxy fatty acids in Y. lipolytica; however, the deletion mutant strain lacking all these genes is able to oxidize dodecanol (26Gatter M.

FALDH activities have been reported in C. tropicalis, Y. lipolytica, and Candida intermedia (27Liu C.M. Johnson M.J. Alkane oxidation by a particulate preparation from Candida.J.

It has been reported that C. maltosa P450 52A3 expressed heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidizes n-alkane of 16 carbons to the corresponding fatty alcohol, fatty aldehyde, and fatty acid in vitro (30Scheller U.

ALDH3A2, one of the mammalian FALDH, belongs to a superfamily of NAD(P)+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases (31Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Polymorphisms of human aldehyde dehydrogenases: consequences for drug metabolism and disease.Pharmacology. 2000; 61: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Human ALDH3A2 have high activities toward saturated and unsaturated fatty aldehydes of 6–24 carbons in length (32Kelson T.L. Secor McVoy J.R. Rizzo W.B. Human liver fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase: microsomal localization, purification, and biochemical characterization.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ALDH3A2 is involved in various cellular processes: it has been suggested that ALDH3A2 is involved in the breakdown of phytanic acid in the peroxisome (33Verhoeven N.M. Jakobs C. Carney G. Somers M.P.

Rogers G.R. Hamrock D.J. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Compton J.G. Markova N. Rizzo W.B. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome is caused by mutations in the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase gene.Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae has an ortholog of the ALDH3A2 gene, HFD1, and S. cerevisiae Hfd1p and mammalian ALDH3A2 are responsible for the conversion of hexadecenal to hexadecenoic acid in the degradation process of sphingosine 1-phosphate (37Nakahara K.

The focus of this study was four genes predicted to encode FALDHs, whose amino acid sequences exhibit similarities to those of FALDHs of S. cerevisiae (Hfd1p) and mammals (ALDH3A2), in the Y. lipolytica genome. These four genes were named HFD1, HFD2, HFD3, and HFD4 and were analyzed in terms of the roles they play in the n-alkane assimilation. Our data suggest that Hfd proteins are involved in the oxidation of fatty aldehydes in the n-alkane metabolism process in Y. lipolytica. Yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table 1.

Correct integration was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2071539841,"Gene expression relies on the balance between mRNA synthesis in the nucleus and decay in the cytoplasm, processes once thought to be separate. We now know that transcription and decay rates are coordinated, but the factors or molecular mechanisms are unclear. The Ccr4-Not complex regulates multiple stages of gene expression, from mRNA synthesis to protein destruction. One of its functions is to promote RNA polymerase II elongation by reactivating arrested elongation complexes. Here we explored the features of polymerase required for Ccr4-Not to promote elongation and found that the Rpb4/7 module is important for Ccr4-Not to associate with elongation complexes and stimulate elongation. Rpb4/7 has also been implicated in coordinating mRNA synthesis and decay, but its role in this process is controversial. The interplay between Ccr4-Not and Rpb4/7 described here suggests a mechanism for how the cell coordinates mRNA synthesis and decay."
https://openalex.org/W1983064244,"CGI-58 is a lipid droplet-associated protein that, when mutated, causes Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome in humans, which is characterized by excessive storage of triglyceride in various tissues. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the defect remain elusive. CGI-58 was previously reported to catalyze the resynthesis of phosphatidic acid as a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase. In addition to triglyceride, phosphatidic acid is also used a substrate for the synthesis of various mitochondrial phospholipids. In this report, we investigated the propensity of CGI-58 in the remodeling of various phospholipids. We found that the recombinant CGI-58 overexpressed in mammalian cells or purified from Sf9 insect cells catalyzed efficiently the reacylation of lysophosphatidylglycerol to phosphatidylglycerol (PG), which requires acyl-CoA as the acyl donor. In contrast, the recombinant CGI-58 was devoid of acyltransferase activity toward other lysophospholipids. Accordingly, overexpression and knockdown of CGI-58 adversely affected the endogenous PG level in C2C12 cells. PG is a substrate for the synthesis of cardiolipin, which is required for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and mitophagy. Consequently, overexpression and knockdown of CGI-58 adversely affected autophagy and mitophagy in C2C12 cells. In support for a key role of CGI-58 in mitophagy, overexpression of CGI-58 significantly stimulated mitochondrial fission and translocation of PINK1 to mitochondria, key steps involved in mitophagy. Furthermore, overexpression of CGI-58 promoted mitophagic initiation through activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibition of mTORC1 mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling, the positive and negative regulators of autophagy, respectively. Together, these findings identified novel molecular mechanisms by which CGI-58 regulates lipid homeostasis, because defective autophagy is implicated in dyslipidemia and fatty liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1984499494,"Lipoapoptosis occurring due to an excess of saturated free fatty acids such as palmitate is a key pathogenic event in the initiation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Palmitate loading of cells activates the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, including induction of the proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Furthermore, the loss of microRNAs is implicated in regulating apoptosis under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The aim of this study was to identify specific microRNAs regulating CHOP expression during palmitate-induced ER stress. Five microRNAs were repressed under palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions in hepatocyte cell lines (miR-92b-3p, miR-328-3p, miR-484, miR-574-5p, and miR-615-3p). We identified miR-615-3p as a candidate microRNA which was repressed by palmitate treatment and regulated CHOP protein expression, by RNA sequencing and in silico analyses, respectively. There is a single miR-615-3p binding site in the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of the Chop transcript. We characterized this as a functional binding site using a reporter gene-based assay. Augmentation of miR-615-3p levels, using a precursor molecule, repressed CHOP expression; and under these conditions palmitate- or tunicamycin-induced cell death were significantly reduced. Our results suggest that palmitate-induced apoptosis requires maximal expression of CHOP which is achieved via the downregulation of its repressive microRNA, miR-615-3p. We speculate that enhancement of miR-615-3p levels may be of therapeutic benefit by inhibiting palmitate-induced hepatocyte lipoapoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1993263557,"Two acidic residues, Glu-48 and Glu-49, of cytochrome b5 (b5) are essential for stimulating the 17,20-lyase activity of cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17A1). Substitution of Ala, Gly, Cys, or Gln for these two glutamic acid residues abrogated all capacity to stimulate 17,20-lyase activity. Mutations E49D and E48D/E49D retained 23 and 38% of wild-type activity, respectively. Using the zero-length cross-linker ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, we obtained cross-linked heterodimers of b5 and CYP17A1, wild-type, or mutations R347K and R358K. In sharp contrast, the b5 double mutation E48G/E49G did not form cross-linked complexes with wild-type CYP17A1. Mass spectrometric analysis of the CYP17A1-b5 complexes identified two cross-linked peptide pairs as follows: CYP17A1-WT: (84)EVLIKK(89)-b5: (53)EQAGGDATENFEDVGHSTDAR(73) and CYP17A1-R347K: (341)TPTISDKNR(349)-b5: (40)FLEEHPGGEEVLR(52). Using these two sites of interaction and Glu-48/Glu-49 in b5 as constraints, protein docking calculations based on the crystal structures of the two proteins yielded a structural model of the CYP17A1-b5 complex. The appositional surfaces include Lys-88, Arg-347, and Arg-358/Arg-449 of CYP17A1, which interact with Glu-61, Glu-42, and Glu-48/Glu-49 of b5, respectively. Our data reveal the structural basis of the electrostatic interactions between these two proteins, which is critical for 17,20-lyase activity and androgen biosynthesis."

Major focus of the study was to analyze the spectrum and number of microorganisms in relation to the indwelling time of stents and the risk factors for sludge formation. 343 stents were sonicated to optimize the bacterial release from the biofilm and identified by matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF). 2283 bacteria were analyzed in total. The most prevalent microorganisms were Enterococcus species (spp.) (504;22%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (218;10%) and Candida spp. (188;8%). Colonization of the stents mainly began with aerobic gram-positive bacteria (43/49;88%) and Candida spp. (25/49;51%), whereas stents with an indwelling time>60 days(d) showed an almost equal colonization rate by aerobic gram-negative (176/184;96%) and aerobic gram-positive bacteria (183/184;99%) and a high proportion of anaerobes (127/184;69%). Compared to stents without sludge, more Clostridium spp. [(P = 0.02; Odds Ratio (OR): 2.4; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): (1.1–4.9)]) and Staphylococcus spp. [(P = 0.03; OR (95%CI): 4.3 (1.1–16.5)] were cultured from stents with sludge. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between the number of microorganisms [P<0.01; OR (95%CI): 1.3(1.1–1.5)], the indwelling time [P<0.01; 1–15 d vs. 20–59 d: OR (95%CI): 5.6(1.4–22), 1–15 d vs. 60–3087 d: OR (95% CI): 9.5(2.5–35.7)], the presence of sideholes [P<0.01; OR (95%CI): 3.5(1.6–7.9)] and the occurrence of sludge. Stent occlusion was found in 70/343(20%) stents. In 35% of cases, stent occlusion resulted in a cholangitis or cholestasis. In conclusion, microbial colonization of the stents changed with the indwelling time. Sludge was associated with an altered spectrum and an increasing number of microorganisms, a long indwelling time and the presence of sideholes. Interestingly, stent occlusion did not necessarily lead to a symptomatic biliary obstruction."

In cell cultures, this microbe secretes hemin/hemoglobin-binding protein 2 (Hbp2; Lmo2185) protein, which has been proposed to function as a hemophore that scavenges heme from the environment. Based on its primary sequence, Hbp2 contains three NEAr transporter (NEAT) domains of unknown function. Here we show that each of these domains mediates high affinity binding to ferric heme (hemin) and that its N- and C-terminal domains interact with hemoglobin (Hb). The results of hemin transfer experiments are consistent with Hbp2 functioning as an Hb-binding hemophore that delivers hemin to other Hbp2 proteins that are attached to the cell wall.

To elucidate the mechanism of hemin binding by Hbp2, we determined crystal structures of its central NEAT domain (Hbp2N2; residues 183–303) in its free and hemin-bound states. The structures reveal an unprecedented mechanism of hemin binding in which Hbp2N2 undergoes a major conformational rearrangement that facilitates metal coordination by a non-canonical tyrosine residue.

Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, an infection characterized by gastroenteritis, meningitis, encephalitis, and maternofetal infections in humans.

To establish an infection, L. monocytogenes must overcome innate nutritional immunity mechanisms that limit microbial access to iron by sequestering this precious element intracellularly and within extracellular proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and hemopexin. Protoporphyrin IX + iron (heme) bound to human hemoglobin contains ∼70% of the human body's total iron.

Hbp2 is expressed under iron-deficient conditions from the svpA-srtB operon, which also encodes a sortase (SrtB), components of an ABC transporter of unknown function (Lmo2182, Lmo2183, and Lmo2184), and three uncharacterized proteins (Lmo2178, Lmo2179, and Lmo2180) (see Fig. 1A).

At higher hemin concentrations (>50 nm hemin), the HupDGC ABC transporter complex is sufficient for efficient hemin accumulation in the cytoplasm (3Jin B. Newton S.M. Shao Y. Jiang X. Charbit A.

The role of Hbp1 in hemin acquisition remains unknown, but the gene encoding this protein is also located in the svpA-srtB operon where it is presumably co-expressed with Hbp2 in iron-depleted conditions. Based on primary sequence homology, the Hbp1 and Hbp2 proteins contain NEAr transporter (NEAT) domains, but the functions of these domains are not known (see Fig. 1B). Here we demonstrate that Hbp1 and Hbp2 bind to Hb and hemin. To gain insight into the mechanism of hemin binding, crystal structures of the central NEAT domain from Hbp2 (Hbp2N2; residues 183–303) and the Hbp2N2-hemin complex were determined at 2.7- and 1.8-Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a unique mode of metal ligation and an induced fit binding mechanism that have not been reported previously for a NEAT domain. The results of hemin transfer experiments are consistent with the notion that Hbp2 functions as an Hb-scavenging hemophore that delivers hemin to Hbp2 located within the cell wall. In vitro, this process occurs rapidly via the formation of an Hbp2-Hbp2 hemin transfer complex. The results of these studies provide new insight into the mechanism through which L. monocytogenes and other Gram-positive pathogens capture heme iron. DNA for subcloning was amplified from the L. monocytogenes EGD-e genome using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the pHis-SUMO vector (11Senturia R. Faller M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Hwang D. Clubb R.T. Guo F. Structure of the dimerization domain of DiGeorge critical region 8.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding proteins containing a removable N-terminal hexahistidine-small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) tag were generated using standard cloning protocols. The following plasmids that express proteins with the SUMO tag (His6-SUMO tag) were constructed: pRM245 coding for amino acids 31–170 in Hbp2 (Hbp2N1), pRM246 coding for amino acids 183–303 in Hbp2 (Hbp2N2), pRM247 coding for amino acids 360–479 in Hbp2 (Hbp2N3), pRM248 coding for amino acids 31–479 in Hbp2, and pRM251 coding for amino acids 31–149 in Hbp1. Site-directed mutagenesis of His6-SUMO-Hbp2N2 was performed on plasmid pRM246 to generate plasmids pRM257 and pRM258 that express Hbp2N2(Y280A) and Hbp2N2(Y289A), respectively (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed by transforming the aforementioned plasmids into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (New England BioLabs). Proteins were expressed overnight at 25 °C by adding 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Proteins were purified as described previously (12Spirig T. Malmirchegini G.R. Zhang J. Robson S.A. Sjodt M. Liu M. Krishna Kumar K. Dickson C.F. Gell D.A. Lei B. Loo J.A. Clubb R.T. Staphylococcus aureus uses a novel multidomain receptor to break apart human hemoglobin and steal its heme.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1065-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and ruptured by sonication, and the Hbps were purified using a cobalt (Co2+)-chelating column. The ULP1 protease was then used to cleave the N-terminal His6-SUMO tag. Hemin-saturated proteins were generated by adding hemin in 1.5-fold excess to purified protein solutions followed by removal of excess hemin using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The hemin saturation level was checked by recording UV-visible spectra and calculating the ASoret/A280. To create the apo form of the proteins used in this study, hemin was removed from purified proteins by methyl ethyl ketone extraction (13Ascoli F. Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Preparation and properties of apohemoglobin and reconstituted hemoglobins.Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The ELISA was performed using 96-well plates (Corning, Sigma). Wells were coated with a volume of 100 μl of 10 μg/ml human hemoglobin (Sigma) dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4 and incubated on an orbital shaker overnight at 4 °C. Blocking of nonspecific sites was achieved by washing off coating solution with PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) and applying 200 μl of a solution of PBS, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, 50 μl of each NEAT domain-containing protein solution was added to each well at a range of concentrations (0.5–250 pmol of total protein in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated for 10 min on an orbital shaker at room temperature. After washing, 50 μl of monoclonal mouse IgG antibody against the hexahistidine tag (Abgent) was applied at a 1000-fold dilution in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h on an orbital shaker at room temperature. After washing with PBS, pH 9, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 μl of monoclonal goat IgG antibody against mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was added at a 10,000-fold dilution in PBS, pH 9, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h on an orbital shaker at room temperature. After final washes in PBS, pH 9, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 μl of 1-Step p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Pierce) was added to develop the signal. The wells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h on an orbital shaker and then overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker. Optical densities were measured at 405 nm on an ELISA plate reader (Spectramax M5, Molecular Devices) at 30 min, 1 h, and overnight. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed using a MicroCal iTC200 calorimeter (GE Healthcare). The apo forms of proteins to be studied were dialyzed into ITC buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3, 5% DMSO). A fresh 4.1 mm hemin solution (Sigma) was immediately prepared before each titration by dissolving hemin into ITC buffer. The cell was filled with apoprotein, and the syringe was filled with hemin solution. Sixteen injections were performed using 2.5-μl aliquots (260 s between injections). The data were analyzed using MicroCal iTC200 analysis software (GE Healthcare). Hemin binding affinities for the following proteins were determined: Hbp1, Hbp2N2, Hbp2N3, Hbp2N2(Y280A), and Hbp2N2(Y289A). A column-based approach was used to measure hemin transfer from Hbp2 to Hbp1. The apo form of His6-SUMO-Hbp1 and the holo form of Hbp2 were prepared according to aforementioned protocols. Both proteins were dissolved in transfer buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). They were allowed to incubate at room temperature for varying amounts of time after mixing; His6-SUMO-Hbp1 (15 μm) was mixed with holo-Hbp2 (15 μm). The proteins were then separated by applying them to a Co2+-chelating column that had been pre-equilibrated in transfer buffer. The column was then washed four times with 1.0 ml of transfer buffer followed by elution of the His6-SUMO-Hbp1 protein with 1 ml of the following buffer: 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. Hemin content was quantified by determining the ASoret/A280 ratio for each of the fractions at the indicated time points, and this was then divided by the ratio representing heme-saturated protein. To monitor heme release into the solvent by different proteins, they were incubated with recombinant sperm whale myoglobin that contained H64Y and V68F mutations (H64Y/V68F Mb) (14Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. His64(E7) → Tyr apomyoglobin as a reagent for measuring rates of hemin dissociation.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these studies, proteins were exchanged into PBS buffer, pH 7.4. Heme-saturated donor proteins (Hbp1 or Hbp2) were added to H64Y/V68F Mb to a final concentration of 5 and 50 μm, respectively. Sucrose was also added to a final concentration of 450 μm to prevent protein aggregation as described previously (14Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. His64(E7) → Tyr apomyoglobin as a reagent for measuring rates of hemin dissociation.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were then recorded between 260 and 700 nm for up to 24 h at 25 °C. The change in absorbance at 600 nm was plotted with time and used as a measure of hemin dissociation. All kinetics data were analyzed using the program GraphPad Prism. The apo form of Hbp2N2 (residues 183–303) was prepared as detailed above and dialyzed into a 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0 buffer. The protein solution was concentrated to 150 mg/ml and crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in a reservoir solution of 100 mm sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, pH 5.4, 200 mm potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, 2.0 m ammonium sulfate. Large cubic crystals appeared within 3 days. Crystals were stored in liquid N2 after soaking in cryoprotectant solution that consisted of 2 m trimethylamine N-oxide dihydrate mixed 1:1 with the reservoir solution. The best diffracting crystals were obtained by soaking them in cryoprotectant solution for 2–5 min. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced by withholding native methionine and supplementing bacterial cells with selenomethionine upon induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma). Selenomethionine-Hbp2N2 was purified as described above and crystallized similarly to the native protein. The crystals belonged to space group I23 with one protein molecule per asymmetric unit. All diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) beamline 24-ID-C using a Dectris Pilatus 6M pixel detector. Crystals were cryocooled to 100 K during the data collection. One hundred 1.0° oscillation frames were collected at a wavelength of 0.9795 Å. Data reduction and scaling were performed using XDS (15Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11294) Google Scholar). The resolution of the data set was drawn at 2.7 Å (16Karplus P.A. Diederichs K. Linking crystallographic model and data quality.Science. 2012; 336: 1030-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Experimental phases were obtained from the selenomethionine derivative using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. Diffraction data sets were collected at two wavelengths on a selenomethionine derivative at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) beamline 24-ID-C. One data set was collected at the peak energy for selenium (0.9792 Å), and one was collected at a high energy remote (0.9686 Å). A data set at a low energy remote was collected in house using a Rigaku FR-E rotating copper anode (1.5418-Å wavelength) and an R-AXIS HTC imaging plate detector. The resulting electron density map was sufficiently clear to allow manual placement of a homologous structure, IsdX1, an anthrax hemophore (Protein Data Bank code 3SZ6) (17Ekworomadu M.T. Poor C.B. Owens C.P. Balderas M.A. Fabian M. Olson J.S. Murphy F. Bakkalbasi E. Honsa E.S. He C. Goulding C.W. Maresso A.W. Differential function of lip residues in the mechanism and biology of an anthrax hemophore.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002559Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The model was mutated to the Hbp2N2 sequence using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion map as a guide. The model was then refined against the isomorphous native apo data set, which was at higher resolution than the selenomethionine derivative data. Methods for model building and refinement are discussed below. The Hbp2N2-hemin complex used for crystallization trials was generated by adding free hemin to apo-Hbp2N2. Extensive effort was put forth to remove hemin aggregates prior to adding it to the protein. Briefly, in this procedure, 40 mg of hemin was dissolved in 4 ml of 0.1 m NaOH (4 °C) and then vortexed. A total of 4 ml of buffer A (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was then added to the hemin solution, and it was then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The hemin solution was then diluted with 8 ml of buffer A and centrifuged for 10 min to pellet aggregated hemin. The hemin concentration of the cleared solution was 3 mm as determined by UV absorbance (assuming ϵ385 = 58.44 mm−1 cm−1). Hemin was then added slowly to the protein in 100-μl aliquots to a final concentration such that it was in 1.5-fold molar excess. The protein/hemin mixture was incubated at room temperature on a tube rotator for 1 h. The excess hemin was removed by separating the mixture using a Sephadex G-25 column. Fractions containing the Hbp2N2-hemin complex were then dialyzed overnight into buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) solution. After concentration, the protein was then applied onto a Sephacryl S-100 XK 26/100 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B, and pure fractions were pooled for crystallography trials. The Hbp2N2-hemin complex was concentrated to 53 mg/ml and crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in a reservoir solution of 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10 mm ZnCl2, 20% polyethylene glycol 6000. Crystals grew within 1 day and were cryoprotected by soaking the crystals briefly in reservoir solution that contained 35% glycerol. An x-ray diffraction data set was collected on beamline 24-ID-C as described above for apo-Hbp2N2. The crystals used to solve the structure were in the P21 space group and contained two protein-hemin complexes per unit cell. The structure of apo-Hbp2N2 was used as a search model for molecular replacement. The resolution limit of the data set was drawn at 1.8 Å. Models of apo-Hbp2N2 and the Hbp2N2-hemin complex were refined using REFMAC5 (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

After each refinement step, the model was visually inspected in Coot using both 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc difference maps (21Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17196) Google Scholar). Final structural models were validated using MolProbity (22Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Eisenberg D. Assessment of protein models with three-dimensional profiles.Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar). Inspection of the primary sequences of Hbp1 and Hbp2 reveals that they contain NEAT domains (Fig. 1B). Because the functions of these domains are not known, we biochemically characterized their ligand binding properties. Initially, Hbp1 (residues Asp31–Ala149) and Hbp2 (residues Ser31–Ala479) polypeptides that contain the intact protein with the exception of the N- and C-terminal signal peptides and cell wall sorting signals, respectively (Fig. 1B), were purified. Upon overexpression and purification of these polypeptides from E. coli, it was immediately apparent that they interacted with hemin based on the presence of Soret peaks in their UV-visible spectra (Fig. 2A). To define the location of hemin binding in Hbp2, we purified polypeptides containing each of its three NEAT domains: Hbp2N1 (residues Ser31–Phe170), Hbp2N2 (residues Thr183–Lys303), and Hbp2N3 (residues Leu360–Ala479). As with the Hbp2 protein, upon purification, each domain had a reddish brown color, and UV-visible spectrum analysis revealed the presence of a Soret peak. Thus, all three NEAT domains within Hbp2 are capable of binding hemin. The hemin binding affinities of the isolated NEAT domains were determined using ITC. This analysis was performed using the apo form of each domain, which was produced using the methyl ethyl ketone organic extraction method (13Ascoli F. Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Preparation and properties of apohemoglobin and reconstituted hemoglobins.Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In these experiments, a syringe filled"

After synaptic vesicle fusion, glycine is recovered back to the presynaptic terminal by the neuronal glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) to maintain quantal glycine content in synaptic vesicles. The loss of presynaptic GlyT2 drastically impairs the refilling of glycinergic synaptic vesicles and severely disrupts neurotransmission. Indeed, mutations in the gene encoding GlyT2 are the main presynaptic cause of hyperekplexia in humans. Here, we show a novel endogenous regulatory mechanism that can modulate GlyT2 activity based on a compartmentalized interaction between GlyT2, neuronal plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) isoforms 2 and 3, and Na+/Ca2+-exchanger 1 (NCX1). This GlyT2·PMCA2,3·NCX1 complex is found in lipid raft subdomains where GlyT2 has been previously found to be fully active. We show that endogenous PMCA and NCX activities are necessary for GlyT2 activity and that this modulation depends on lipid raft integrity. Besides, we propose a model in which GlyT2·PMCA2–3·NCX complex would help Na+/K+-ATPase in controlling local Na+ increases derived from GlyT2 activity after neurotransmitter release.

Glycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the CNS that acts in neuronal circuits of the central auditory pathway, receptive fields in the retina, and spinal cord-sensitive pathways.

GlyT2 activity dysfunctions reduce presynaptic glycine release and cause significant lacking of inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission. In humans, this situation causes hyperekplexia or startle disease, a rare disease that is characterized by an exaggerated startle response, usually evoked by tactile or auditory stimuli, leading to hypertonia and apnea episodes that in some cases produce sudden infant death (6Rees M.I.

GlyT2 has a crucial role in the pathophysiology of inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission, and studying modulatory factors that regulate its activity might help the success of future therapies.

Ca2+ ions are widely known essential regulators of synaptic function because of the following: (a) synaptic neurotransmitter release is driven by Ca2+ influxes through voltage-gated calcium channels (17Dittman J.

Thus, neurons invest large amounts of energy in controlling and maintaining an abrupt gradient between intracellular (∼0.1-μm) and extracellular (∼1.4-mm) Ca2+ concentrations. Plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs) have the key biochemical function of extruding cytosolic Ca2+ out of the cell (by the spent of ATP) in a calmodulin-stimulated manner (22Mata A.M. Berrocal M.

The distribution of PMCA isoforms in isolated DRMs (or lipid rafts) is a point of controversy because in synaptic plasma membranes (SPMs) from pig cerebellum PMCA4 seems to be the only isoform located in raft domains (31Sepúlveda M.R.

Similarly, we have described that GlyT2 can be found in DRMs where it displays the highest transport activity (11Núñez E. Alonso-Torres P. Fornés A. Aragón C. López-Corcuera B.

In this study, we have identified neuronal PMCA isoforms 2 and 3 and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) as new interacting and regulatory partners of GlyT2. We found that GlyT2, PMCA2/3, and NCX1 are co-enriched in neuronal lipid raft membrane clusters. Pharmacological inhibition of PMCA activity by the specific inhibitor caloxin 2a1, as well as specific inhibition of the reverse mode of NCX by KB-R7943 mesylate (KB-mes), led to a marked reduction in GlyT2 activity suggesting that proper Ca2+ extrusion in presynaptic terminals is somehow necessary for optimal GlyT2 activity. This PMCA/NCX regulation of GlyT2 depends on lipid raft integrity because lipid raft disruption by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) blocks caloxin 2a1 and KB-mes effects and reduces co-localization of NCX and PMCAs with GlyT2. Here, we suggest that the local functional coupling between GlyT2, PMCA2/3, and NCX1 occurs in lipid raft domains and that this association may help in correcting the local imbalance of Na+ produced during high activity periods of 1glycine-3Na+ co-transport by GlyT2 after neurotransmitter release. These local increases in cytosolic Na+ could not be entirely covered by the Na+/K+-ATPase activity due to its slow Na+-extruding rate (200 s−1) (37Skou J.C.

Synaptosomes or primary neurons from the brainstem or spinal cord (100 μg) were lysed for 30 min at room temperature at a concentration of 1.5 mg of protein/ml in TN buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) + Sigma mixture). After 15 min of centrifugation in a microcentrifuge to remove the cell debris, 4 μg of protein were separated to quantify total protein, and 5 μl of the primary antibody were added and left overnight at 4 °C using the following antibodies for immunoprecipitation: rat anti-GlyT2, anti-PMCA (clone 5F10), or anti-NCX1. A negative control was also run in parallel in which an irrelevant antibody was added, denoted as IgG. Subsequently, 50 μl of 50% protein G-agarose beads (ABT Beads) were added and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by mild centrifugation and washed twice for 7 min with lysis buffer at room temperature. Finally, the beads were pelleted, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer at 75 °C for 10 min, resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7.5%), detected in Western blots by ECL, and quantified on a GS-810 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). The amount loaded was always 4 μg of total protein and 96 μg of immunoprecipitated sample or IgG immunoprecipitation controls. This ratio allows having both samples in the same linear range of exposure. Primary cultures of brainstem and spinal cord neurons were prepared as described previously (13de Juan-Sanz J. Núñez E.

The primary antibodies used in this work were incubated overnight at 4 °C using the following dilutions: GlyT2 (1:500); PSD95 (1:500); PMCA2 (1:250); PMCA3 (1:150); NCX1 (1:200); and Thy-1 (1:500). The cells were visualized by confocal microscopy on an inverted microscope Axiovert200 (Zeiss). Immunohistochemistry experiments from rat brainstem slices were performed as described previously (42Cubelos B. Leite C. Giménez C. Zafra F.

The sections shown in this work correspond to the ventral cochlear nucleus of the brainstem. Uptake assays in brainstem and spinal cord synaptosomes were performed in constant mild shaking at 37 °C in PBS containing 2 μCi/ml [3H]glycine (1.6 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cold glycine (1 μm final concentration), plus 10 μm N[3-(4′-fluorophenyl)-3-(4′-phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine to inhibit glycine transport by GlyT1 (IC50 = 16 nm) with or without the specific GlyT2 inhibitor ALX1393 (0.5 μm, IC50 = 50 nm) to measure background glycine accumulation. After incubating 20 μg of synaptosomes for 7 min with radioactive medium, synaptosomes were recovered using 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Millipore), washed three times, and prepared for scintillation counting. All assays were performed at least in triplicate and expressed as mean ± S.E. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured using a coupled assay in different conditions to measure the contribution of PMCA and the intracellular SERCA and SPCA ATPases as described in Sepúlveda et al.

Images were processed with a 2.0-pixel median filter, and the threshold used was automatically determined by the JACoP plugin (44Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3211) Google Scholar). The Pearson's value was obtained with JACoP by comparing the two thresholded channels and measuring the correlation between them. The value can range from −1 to 1, with 1 representing the maximal co-localization possible (two identical images), whereas values ≥0.5 can usually be considered as valid co-localization (45Zinchuk V.

Mulle C. Manzoni O.J. An automated method to quantify and visualize colocalized fluorescent signals.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 146: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Pixel fluorescence intensity profiles were also generated using ImageJ software. The linear region of interest was manually drawn to cross several GlyT2-PMCA/NCX-Thy-1 clusters, and the fluorescence intensity profiles were obtained from each individual color channel using the RGB_profiler plugin. Intensity profile plots were generated in Origin 8.0 (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 8, green, PMCAs/NCX1; red, GlyT2; blue, Thy-1), and triple co-localization spots were considered valid only when intensity values of the three proteins were higher than 65% of the maximum at the same region.FIGURE 5GlyT2 is present in neuronal lipid rafts containing PMCA2 or PMCA3.

https://openalex.org/W2083819830,"Systematic, high-throughput dissection of causal post-translational regulatory dependencies, on a genome wide basis, is still one of the great challenges of biology. Due to its complexity, however, only a handful of computational algorithms have been developed for this task. Here we present CINDy (Conditional Inference of Network Dynamics), a novel algorithm for the genome-wide, context specific inference of regulatory dependencies between signaling protein and transcription factor activity, from gene expression data. The algorithm uses a novel adaptive partitioning methodology to accurately estimate the full Condition Mutual Information (CMI) between a transcription factor and its targets, given the expression of a signaling protein. We show that CMI analysis is optimally suited to dissecting post-translational dependencies. Indeed, when tested against a gold standard dataset of experimentally validated protein-protein interactions in signal transduction networks, CINDy significantly outperforms previous methods, both in terms of sensitivity and precision."
https://openalex.org/W1974478180,"The Notch2 is a critical membrane receptor for B-cell functions, and also displays various biological roles in lymphoma pathogenesis. In this article, we reported that 3 of 69 (4.3%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) exhibited a truncate NOTCH2 mutation at the nucleotide 7605 (G/A) in the cDNA sequence, which led to partial deletion of the C-terminal of PEST (proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich) domain. The truncate Notch2 activated both the Notch2 and the NF-κB signals and promoted the proliferation of B-cell lymphoma cell lines, including DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Moreover, the ectopic proliferation was completely inhibited by ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-κB inhibitor. Simultaneously, PDTC also reduced the expression level of Notch2. Based on these results, we conclude that the Notch2 receptor with PEST domain truncation enhances cell proliferation which may be associated with the activation of the Notch2 and the NF-κB signaling. Our results are expected to provide a possible target for new DLBCL therapies by suppressing the Notch2 and the NF-κB signaling."

The isolates were identified using spectral techniques in the light of literature. 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity screening of the isolated constituents was carried out against six human cancer cell lines including lung (A549 and NCI-H322), epidermoid carcinoma (A431), melanoma (A375), prostate (PC-3) and Colon (HCT-116) cell lines. Osthol (12) exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 3.2, 6.2, 10.9, 14.5, 24.8, and 30.2 µM against epidermoid carcinoma (A431), melanoma (A375), lung (NCI-H322), lung (A549), prostate (PC-3) and colon (HCT-116) cell lines respectively. Epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 was sensitive to most of the compounds followed by lung (A549) cancer cell line. Finally a simple and reliable HPLC method was developed (RP-HPLC-DAD) and validated for the simultaneous quantification of these cytotoxic constituents in Prangos pabularia. The extract was analyzed using a reversed-phase Agilent ZORBAX eclipse plus column C18 (4.6×250 mm, 5 µm) at 250 nm wavelength using a gradient water-methanol solvent system at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The RP-HPLC method is validated in terms of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra and inter-day validation). This method, because of shorter analysis time, makes it valuable for the commercial quality control of Prangos pabularia extracts and its future pharmaceutical preparations."

Male-on-male aggression and pathogen primes were associated with increased preference for masculine traits, but the same effect emerged in the neutral condition. We show the increased preference for masculine traits was due to repeated exposure to these traits, not the priming images themselves. Images of male-on-female aggression were an exception; these elicited feelings of disgust and anger appeared to disrupt the preference for masculinized traits. The results suggest women process men’s facial and vocal traits as signals of aggressive potential and lose any preference for these traits with cues indicating men might direct this aggression toward them."
https://openalex.org/W2090820537,"Anemonefishes and their host sea anemones form an iconic symbiotic association in reef environments, and are highly sought after in the marine aquarium trade. This study examines asexual propagation as a method for culturing a geographically widespread and commonly traded species of host sea anemone, Entacmaea quadricolor. Two experiments were done: the first to establish whether size or colour morph influenced survival after cutting into halves or quarters; and the second to see whether feeding was needed to maximise survival and growth after cutting. Survival rates were high in both experiments, with 89.3 and 93.8% of the anemones cut in half, and 62.5 and 80.4% cut in quarters surviving in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Anemones that were cut in half were larger in size, and healed and grew quicker than those cut in quarters. However, even though survival was lower when the individuals were cut in quarters, this treatment produced the greatest number of anemones. Feeding increased oral disc diameter growth and reduced wet weight loss, but did not significantly influence pedal disc diameter. Given that the anemones took up to 56 d to form an off-centre mouth, it is highly likely that feeding may have produced greater effect if the experiment was run for longer. This low technology method of propagation could be used to produce individuals throughout the year and the anemones could then be used to supply the aquarium trade or restock depleted habitats, thus supporting biodiversity conservation in coral reef areas."
https://openalex.org/W2165546811,"UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase is an α2β2γ2 hexameric enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting signal on lysosomal hydrolases. Mutations in the α/β subunit precursor gene cause the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (ML II) or the more moderate mucolipidosis III alpha/beta (ML III α/β), while mutations in the γ subunit gene cause the mildest disorder, mucolipidosis III gamma (ML III γ). Here we report neurologic consequences of mouse models of ML II and ML III γ. The ML II mice have a total loss of acid hydrolase phosphorylation, which results in depletion of acid hydrolases in mesenchymal-derived cells. The ML III γ mice retain partial phosphorylation. However, in both cases, total brain extracts have normal or near normal activity of many acid hydrolases reflecting mannose 6-phosphate-independent lysosomal targeting pathways. While behavioral deficits occur in both models, the onset of these changes occurs sooner and the severity is greater in the ML II mice. The ML II mice undergo progressive neurodegeneration with neuronal loss, astrocytosis, microgliosis and Purkinje cell depletion which was evident at 4 months whereas ML III γ mice have only mild to moderate astrocytosis and microgliosis at 12 months. Both models accumulate the ganglioside GM2, but only ML II mice accumulate fucosylated glycans. We conclude that in spite of active mannose 6-phosphate-independent targeting pathways in the brain, there are cell types that require at least partial phosphorylation function to avoid lysosomal dysfunction and the associated neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2149846068,"Acinetobacter species are assuming an increasingly important role in modern medicine, with their persistent presence in health-care settings and antibiotic resistance. However, clinical reports addressing this issue in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis are rare.All PD peritonitis episodes caused by Acinetobacter that occurred between 1985 and 2012 at a single centre were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features, microbiological data, and outcomes were analysed, with stratifications based upon temporal periods (before and after 2000).Acinetobacter species were responsible for 26 PD peritonitis episodes (3.5% of all episodes) in 25 patients. A. baumannii was the most common pathogen (54%), followed by A. iwoffii (35%), with the former being predominant after 2000. Significantly more episodes resulted from breaks in exchange sterility after 2000, while those from exit site infections decreased (P = 0.01). The interval between the last and current peritonitis episodes lengthened significantly after 2000 (5 vs. 13.6 months; P = 0.05). All the isolates were susceptible to cefepime, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycosides, with a low ceftazidime resistance rate (16%). Nearly half of the patients (46%) required hospitalisation for their Acinetobacter PD-associated peritonitis, and 27% required an antibiotic switch. The overall outcome was fair, with no mortality and a 12% technique failure rate, without obvious interval differences.The temporal change in the microbiology and origin of Acinetobacter PD-associated peritonitis in our cohort suggested an important evolutional trend. Appropriate measures, including technique re-education and sterility maintenance, should be taken to decrease the Acinetobacter peritonitis incidence in PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2031214692,"Objectives To explore the relationship between depressive symptoms and waist-to-hip ratio, dyslipidemia, glycemic levels or blood pressure among diabetic and non-diabetic Chinese women. Methods 11,908 women aged ≥40 years were enrolled in this cross-sectional study, including 2,511 with type 2 diabetes and 9,397 without. Depressive symptoms (defined as having mild-to-severe depressive symptoms) were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) diagnostic algorithm. The prevalence and the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for having depressive symptoms were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results The age-adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms was significantly higher in non-diabetic subjects with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) ≥0.9 (8.6%, age-adjusted OR 1.51 [95% CI 1.17, 1.95]), total cholesterol (TC)>6.22 mmol/L (8.8%, 1.58 [1.16, 2.15]), and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.00 mmol/L (7.7%, 1.69 [1.34, 2.14]), while it was significantly lower in non-diabetic subjects with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80 to 89 mmHg (6.2%, 0.78 [0.64, 0.95]). These relationships remained significant even after controlling for multiple factors (WHR ≥0.9: multivariable-adjusted OR 1.39 [95% CI 1.07, 1.80]; TC>6.22 mmol/L: 1.56 [1.14, 2.12]; HbA1c ≥6.00 mmol/L: 1.64 [1.30, 2.08]; DBP 80-89 mmHg: 0.78 [0.64, 0.95]). However, no significant trend between depressive symptoms and WHC, TC, HbA1c, DBP was observed in diabetic women, and no significant trend relationship between depressive symptoms and BMI, WC, TG, or SBP was observed in both non-diabetic and diabetic women. Moreover, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was significantly higher in previously-diagnosed diabetes, compared with non-diabetic subjects, while no significant differences were observed between newly-diagnosed diabetes and non-diabetic subjects. Conclusion The present study showed a relationship between WHR, TC, HbA1c, DBP and depressive symptoms among non-diabetic women, while no significant relationship between them was observed among diabetic women, even after controlling for multiple confounding factors."
https://openalex.org/W2102830871,"Determining the primary structure (i.e., amino acid sequence) of a protein has become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. Higher order protein structure provides insight into a protein's function in the cell. Understanding a protein's secondary structure is a first step towards this goal. Therefore, a number of computational prediction methods have been developed to predict secondary structure from just the primary amino acid sequence. The most successful methods use machine learning approaches that are quite accurate, but do not directly incorporate structural information. As a step towards improving secondary structure reduction given the primary structure, we propose a Bayesian model based on the knob-socket model of protein packing in secondary structure. The method considers the packing influence of residues on the secondary structure determination, including those packed close in space but distant in sequence. By performing an assessment of our method on 2 test sets we show how incorporation of multiple sequence alignment data, similarly to PSIPRED, provides balance and improves the accuracy of the predictions. Software implementing the methods is provided as a web application and a stand-alone implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2041574453,"Asparagine-linked glycosylation is an endoplasmic reticulum co- and post-translational modification that enables the transit and function of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) glycoproteins. To gain insight into the regulatory role of glycosylation enzymes on RTK function, we investigated shRNA and siRNA knockdown of mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI), an enzyme required for mature glycan precursor biosynthesis. Loss of MPI activity reduced phosphorylation of FGFR family receptors in U-251 and SKMG-3 malignant glioma cell lines and also resulted in significant decreases in FRS2, Akt, and MAPK signaling. However, MPI knockdown did not affect ligand-induced activation or signaling of EGFR or MET RTKs, suggesting that FGFRs are more susceptible to MPI inhibition. The reductions in FGFR signaling were not caused by loss of FGF ligands or receptors, but instead were caused by interference with receptor dimerization. Investigations into the cellular consequences of MPI knockdown showed that cellular programs driven by FGFR signaling, and integral to the clinical progression of malignant glioma, were impaired. In addition to a blockade of cellular migration, MPI knockdown also significantly reduced glioma cell clonogenic survival following ionizing radiation. Therefore our results suggest that targeted inhibition of enzymes required for cell surface receptor glycosylation can be manipulated to produce discrete and limited consequences for critical client glycoproteins expressed by tumor cells. Furthermore, this work identifies MPI as a potential enzymatic target for disrupting cell surface receptor-dependent survival signaling and as a novel approach for therapeutic radiosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2117364137,"We report cell mechanical changes in response to alteration of expression of the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1), a most abundant and widely distributed plasma membrane nucleoside transporter in human cells and/or tissues. Modulation of hENT1 expression level altered the stiffness of pancreatic cancer Capan-1 and Panc 03.27 cells, which was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and correlated to microfluidic platform. The hENT1 knockdown induced reduction of cellular stiffness in both of cells up to 70%. In addition, cellular phenotypic changes such as cell morphology, migration, and expression level of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were observed after hENT1 knockdown. Cells with suppressed hENT1 became elongated, migrated faster, and had reduced E-cadherin and elevated N-cadherin compared to parental cells which are consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Those cellular phenotypic changes closely correlated with changes in cellular stiffness. This study suggests that hENT1 expression level affects cellular phenotype and cell elastic behavior can be a physical biomarker for quantify hENT1 expression and detect phenotypic shift. Furthermore, cell mechanics can be a critical tool in detecting disease progression and response to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2020090880,"Pulmonary damages of oxygen toxicity include vascular leakage and pulmonary edema. We have previously reported that hyperoxia increases the formation of NO and peroxynitrite in lung endothelial cells via increased interaction of endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) with β-actin. A peptide (P326TAT) with amino acid sequence corresponding to the actin binding region of eNOS residues 326–333 has been shown to reduce the hyperoxia-induced formation of NO and peroxynitrite in lung endothelial cells. In the present study, we found that exposure of pulmonary artery endothelial cells to hyperoxia (95% oxygen and 5% CO2) for 48 h resulted in disruption of monolayer barrier integrity in two phases, and apoptosis occurred in the second phase. NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester attenuated the endothelial barrier disruption in both phases. Peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid did not affect the first phase but ameliorated the second phase of endothelial barrier disruption and apoptosis. P326TAT inhibited hyperoxia-induced disruption of monolayer barrier integrity in two phases and apoptosis in the second phase. More importantly, injection of P326TAT attenuated vascular leakage, pulmonary edema, and endothelial apoptosis in the lungs of mice exposed to hyperoxia. P326TAT also significantly reduced the increase in eNOS-β-actin association and protein tyrosine nitration. Together, these results indicate that peptide P326TAT ameliorates barrier dysfunction of hyperoxic lung endothelial monolayer and attenuates eNOS-β-actin association, peroxynitrite formation, endothelial apoptosis, and pulmonary edema in lungs of hyperoxic mice.

Mouse anti-eNOS antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. Antibody against endothelial marker von Willebrand factor was from NOVUS Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Nitrotyrosine antibody was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). l-NAME was from Calbiochem. Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody, uric acid, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) were obtained from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA). Cells were cultured in F12K medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Passages from 2 to 10 were used for experiments. Confluent PAECs were exposed to normoxia (room air, 5% CO2) or to hyperoxia (95% oxygen, 5% CO2) in a sealed chamber for 1–48 h in F12K medium containing 4% FBS. An ECIS-Zeta electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system (Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY) was used to determine transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value as a measurement of endothelial barrier integrity of PAEC monolayer. Confluent endothelial cells were seeded on gold-coated electrodes arrays and equilibrated in F12K medium containing 4% FBS overnight. After resistances were relatively constant (1000–1200 ohms), treatments (uric acid, l-NAME, or peptides) were added directly to the wells and arrays were allowed to equilibrate for another 3 h. Then, cells were exposed to hyperoxia (95% oxygen, 5% CO2) for 48 h. The impedance was recorded for the duration of the experiments. Data were normalized to the mean resistance before hyperoxia exposure. TUNEL staining and caspase-3 assay were used to detect apoptosis. In TUNEL assay, PAECs were plated on Lab-Tek 8-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher). After exposure to hyperoxia, apoptosis was detected using ApopTag Plus fluorescent in situ apoptosis detection kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TUNEL staining was also performed on paraffin-embedded lung sections using the same kit. The slides were subjected to TUNEL staining, which was followed by staining with antibody against von Willebrand factor conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Slides were evaluated by Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Caspase-3 activity was measured using a kit (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After exposure to 95% oxygen for 48 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in lysis buffer, and centrifuged. The enzymatic reaction was performed in 96-well plates at 37 °C using caspase-3 substrate, DEV-pNA (where pNA indicates p-nitroanilide). Caspase-3 activity was assessed by microplate reader at 405 nm. Peptide P326TAT with amino acid sequence corresponding to the actin binding region of eNOS residues 326–333 linked to a 10-amino acid transduction domain of HIV-tat (RKKRRQRRRA) was synthesized by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). Fusion of this 10-amino acid TAT tag is to facilitate delivery of this peptide into cells and tissue (13Kondrikov D. Fonseca F.V. Elms S. Fulton D. Black S.M. Block E.R.

A modified version of actin binding sequence peptide 326 with hydrophobic leucine and tryptophan substituted for neutrally charged alanine was used as a control peptide (PlwTAT). The amino acid sequences of the peptides are RKKRRQRRRALGLRWYAL for P326TAT and RKKRRQRRRAAGARAYAA for PlwTAT. The peptides were synthesized by GenScript. PAECs were incubated with P326TAT or PlwTAT peptides at 20 μm final concentration in F12K medium supplemented with 4% FBS. After 1 h of incubation, cells were exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia for 48 h before being used for TUNEL assay. In some experiments, endothelial monolayer permeability was monitored for up to 48 h. After hyperoxic exposure, PAECs were collected and the nuclear fraction was isolated using a NE-PER nuclear protein extraction kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Male C57BL/6 mice and breeding pairs of eNOS knock-out mice (strain B6.129P2-Nos3 tm1Unc/J, stock number 002684) between 8 and 10 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), All experiments were performed in accordance with the guiding principles of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Case and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Georgia Regents University. For hyperoxic exposure, mice were kept in a clear plastic polypropylene chamber (30 × 20 × 20 inches) with free access to food and water. The oxygen concentration in the chamber was maintained using a ProOx oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Lacona, NY) at 80% for 5 days. The concentration of CO2 in the chamber was lower than 0.3%. Mice were given either P326TAT peptide or control peptide PlwTAT (intraperitoneally, daily, 10 mg/kg). Mice were anesthetized (pentobarbital, 90 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and the trachea was intubated. The mice were then euthanized by using thoracotomy. The blood in pulmonary circulation was rinsed by infusing PBS through pulmonary artery. Then, lungs were removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Alternatively, lungs were removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The analysis of nitrotyrosine level and eNOS/actin co-immunoprecipitation was performed from frozen samples. Paraffin-embedded sections were used for H&E staining and for TUNEL assay and immunostaining against von Willebrand factor. Fluorescence images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 510 as described above. The fluorescence intensity was measured using the software ImageJ. After hyperoxic exposure, mice were injected with Evans blue dye (EBD) (20 mg/kg) via the tail vein (15Veress L.A. O'Neill H.C. Hendry-Hofer T.B. Loader J.E. Rancourt R.C. White C.W.

After 30 min, the mice were then anesthetized using pentobarbital and euthanized by using thoracotomy. The blood in pulmonary circulation was rinsed by infusing PBS through pulmonary artery. The lungs were excised en bloc and weighed. The lungs were then dried for 48 h in an oven at 65 °C and were weighed again. Lung tissue was manually homogenized using a bead beater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) and incubated with double the volume of formamide for 18 h at 60 °C. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected. The optical density of the supernatant was determined by a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. Levels of EBD in samples were quantitated using a standard curve prepared with known amounts of EBD and are expressed as ng/mg of protein. Wet to dry lung weight ratio was calculated as a measure of lung tissue water content expressed as wet to dry ratio adjusted to total body weight. lung homogenates were used for immunoprecipitation as described previously (12Kondrikov D.

Lysates were incubated with anti-eNOS antibody or nonimmune IgG at 4 °C overnight. 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and samples were further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation ad washed three times in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted from Sepharose beads by boiling the samples in 30 μl of SDS immunoblotting samples buffer. Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and supernatants were analyzed by Western blot using appropriate antibodies. In each experiment, control and experimental cells were matched for cell line, age, seeding density, number of passages, and number of days after confluence to avoid variation in tissue culture factors that can influence measurements. Results are shown as means ± S.E. for n experiments. One-way analysis of variance and post t test analyses were used to determine the significance of differences between the means of different groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PAECs were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2 and 5% CO2) or normoxia (air and 5% CO2), and TEER was measured using an ECIS-Zeta electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system. Exposure of PAECs to 95% oxygen for 48 h resulted in decrease in TEER in two phases (Fig. 1A). In the first phase, the TEER started to decrease at 1 h and reached the lowest at 3 h after starting exposure. In the second phase, the TEER began to decrease at 24 h after hyperoxic exposure and exhibited an irreversible decrease after exposure for 48 h (Fig. 1A). PAECs were exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia for 48 h in the presence and absence of NOS inhibitor l-NAME (3 mm). We found that l-NAME prevented decrease in TEER in both phases in hyperoxic PAECs (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the two-phase barrier disruption of hyperoxic lung endothelial monolayer is caused by increased NO production. Exposure of lung endothelial cells to high concentration of oxygen leads to peroxynitrite formation (12Kondrikov D. Elms S. Fulton D. Su Y. eNOS-β-actin interaction contributes to increased peroxynitrite formation during hyperoxia in pulmonary artery endothelial cells and mouse lungs.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35479-35487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To investigate whether hyperoxia-induced disruption of lung endothelial barrier is caused by peroxynitrite, PAECs were exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia for 48 h in the presence and absence of peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid (3 mm). We found that uric acid did not affect hyperoxia-induced decrease in TEER in the first phase (Fig. 2A). However, uric acid prevented the decrease in TEER in hyperoxic PAECs in the second phase (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that peroxynitrite contributes to the barrier disruption of lung endothelial cells in the second phase but not in the first phase. We studied whether hyperoxia-induced disruption of lung endothelial barrier function involves apoptosis of endothelial cells. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL assay. Exposure of PAECs to hyperoxia for 5 h did not cause apoptosis of lung endothelial cells (data not shown). However, exposure to hyperoxia for 48 h resulted in a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that long-term exposure to higher concentration causes apoptosis of lung endothelial cells, which may be related to endothelial barrier disruption in the second phase. Furthermore, treatment of PAECs with uric acid inhibited hyperoxia-induced increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that hyperoxia-induced apoptosis of lung endothelial cells is attributable to peroxynitrite. We have previously shown that specific disruption of eNOS-β-actin interaction using peptide P326TAT prevents hyperoxia-induced NO and peroxynitrite production and tyrosine nitration in intact endothelial cells (12Kondrikov D. Elms S. Fulton D. Su Y. eNOS-β-actin interaction contributes to increased peroxynitrite formation during hyperoxia in pulmonary artery endothelial cells and mouse lungs.J. Biol.

Role of ecNOS-derived NO in mediating TNF-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L914-L922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study whether modulation of eNOS-actin interaction by using peptide P326TAT has an effect on hyperoxia-induced barrier dysfunction of lung endothelial cells, PAECs were pretreated with peptide P326TAT (20 μm) or control peptide PlwTAT (20 μm) and then exposed to hyperoxia. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment of PAECs with P326TAT reduced hyperoxia-induced decrease in TEER in both phases. The control peptide PlwTAT did not influence the effect of hyperoxia on TEER (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that peptide P326TAT attenuates hyperoxia-induced disruption of lung endothelial barrier. PAECs were exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia in the presence of P326TAT (20 μm) or control peptide PlwTAT (20 μm) for 48 h, and then apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL assay. Treatment of PAECs with P326TAT inhibited hyperoxia-induced increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 4), indicating that P326TAT attenuates hyperoxia-induced apoptosis of lung endothelial cells. Wild-type and eNOS knock-out male mice were treated daily with P326TAT (intraperitoneally, 10 mg/kg) or PlwTAT (intraperitoneally, 10 mg/kg) and exposed to 80% oxygen or room air for 5 days. Lung morphology, lung wet/dry ratio, lung microvascular leakage, and lung endothelial apoptosis were assessed. The lungs from wild-type hyperoxic mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT exhibited inflammatory infiltrations, edema, and alveolar wall thickening (Fig. 5A). Injection of P326TAT ameliorated the morphological alterations in the lungs of wild-type hyperoxic mice (Fig. 5A). Moreover, lung wet/dry ratio and EBD leakage from lung vessels are much higher in wild-type hyperoxic mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT (Fig. 5, B and C). P326TAT significantly reduced the increases in lung wet/dry ratio and EBD leakage from lung vessels in wild-type mice exposed to hyperoxia (Fig. 5, B and C). These results indicate that P326TAT ameliorates hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema in mouse lungs. The lungs from eNOS knock-out hyperoxic mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT did not exhibit obvious inflammatory infiltrations, edema, and alveolar wall thickening (Fig. 5A). There was no significant difference in lung morphology between eNOS knock-out hyperoxic mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT and those receiving P326TAT (Fig. 5A). Further, lung wet/dry ratio and EBD leakage from lung vessels are lower in eNOS knock-out hyperoxic mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT (Fig. 5, B and C). There was no significant difference in lung wet/dry ratio and EBD leakage from lung vessels between eNOS knock-out hyperoxic mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT and those receiving P326TAT (Fig. 5, B and C). Taken together, these results indicate that eNOS plays an important role in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema and that the attenuating effect of P326TAT on hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema is through eNOS. We found that hyperoxic exposure resulted in higher numbers of TUNEL-positive endothelial cells in lungs of wild-type mice treated with control peptide PlwTAT and that P326TAT reduced the numbers of TUNEL-positive endothelial cells in lungs of wild-type hyperoxic mice (Fig. 6), suggesting that P326TAT inhibits apoptosis of endothelial cells in the hyperoxic mouse lungs. Further, there was no significant difference in the numbers of TUNEL-positive lung endothelial cells between eNOS knock-out hyperoxic mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT and those receiving P326TAT (Fig. 6), further supporting that eNOS plays an important role in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and that the attenuating effect of P326TAT on hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury is through eNOS. In a previous study, we demonstrated that hyperoxia increases eNOS-β-actin association and protein tyrosine nitration in mouse lungs (12Kondrikov D. Elms S. Fulton D. Su Y. eNOS-β-actin interaction contributes to increased peroxynitrite formation during hyperoxia in pulmonary artery endothelial cells and mouse lungs.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35479-35487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed whether the protective effect of P326TAT on hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema involves its effect on eNOS-β-actin interaction and protein tyrosine nitration in mouse lungs. Consistent with our previous observation, exposure of mice receiving control peptide PlwTAT to 80% oxygen for 5 days resulted in an increase in eNOS-β-actin interaction in lung tissue as detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7). Meanwhile, tyrosine nitration of several proteins in lung homogenates of mice treated with control peptide was elevated (Fig. 8). Treatment with P326TAT attenuated increases in eNOS-β-actin association and protein tyrosine nitration level in the lungs of hyperoxia-exposed mice (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). Together, these data demonstrate that reduction of eNOS-β-actin interaction and protein tyrosine nitration contributes to the protective effect of P326TAT on hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema.FIGURE 8P326TAT attenuates hyperoxia-induced increase in protein tyrosine nitration in mouse lungs. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated daily with P326TAT (intraperitoneally, 10 mg/kg) or PlwTAT (intraperitoneally, 10 mg/kg) and exposed to 80% oxygen or room air for 5 days. Lung homogenates were subjected to Western blot (IB) using anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (nY) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative image of Western blot.

We also found that hyperoxia induced increase in protein contents of AIF in the nuclear faction of lung endothelial cells (Fig. 9B), suggesting that hyperoxia causes caspase-independent apoptosis. Treatment of PAECs with P326TAT prevented increase in intranuclear AIF protein levels in hyperoxic PAECs (Fig. 9B). These data demonstrate that peptide P326TAT prevents caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis of lung endothelial cells. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of peptide P326TAT on lung endothelial barrier disruption in oxygen toxicity. To this end, we utilized two models: a cell model of PAECs exposed to 95% oxygen and an animal model of mice exposed to 80% hyperoxia for 5 days. We found that hyperoxia induced a two-phase disruption of lung endothelial barrier integrity and that peptide P326TAT ameliorates both phases of endothelial barrier dysfunction and endothelial apoptosis. More importantly, P326TAT attenuates peroxynitrite formation, endothelial apoptosis, and pulmonary edema in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in mice of oxygen toxicity. These results indicate that P326TAT can be a novel therapeutic agent to treat or prevent hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury. Several studies have confirmed that exposure of lung endothelial cells to high concentration of oxygen causes disruption of endothelial barrier (8Phillips P.G. Tsan M.F.

Care Med. 1994; 150: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In those studies, the endothelial barrier function was assessed by measuring albumin leakage through endothelial monolayer (8Phillips P.G. Tsan M.F. Hyperoxia causes increased albumin permeability of cultured endothelial monolayers.J. Appl. Physiol. 1988; 64: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Payne D.K. Owens M.W. Grisham M. Early albumin leakage in pulmonary endothelial monolayers exposed to varying levels of hyperoxia.Free Radic. Res. 1996; 25: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present study, we continuously monitored the endothelial barrier function by detecting changes in TEER of PAEC monolayer in real time. We found that prolonged exposure of PAECs to hyperoxia resulted in a two-phase barrier disruption of endothelial monolayer. In the first phase, the endothelial barrier dysfunction starts at 1 h and reached lowest at 3 h after starting exposure. The second phase barrier disruption of endothelial monolayer is irreversible and occurs after hyperoxic exposure for 24 h. Meanwhile, apoptosis is detected in this phase, suggesting that cell death contributes to the second phase disruption of endothelial barrier integrity. NO has been shown to increase endothelial permeability (19Sánchez F.A. Rana R. Kim D.D. Iwahashi T. Zheng R. Lal B.K. Gordon D.M. Meininger C.J. Durán W.N.

Su Y. eNOS-β-actin interaction contributes to increased peroxynitrite formation during hyperoxia in pulmonary artery endothelial cells and mouse lungs.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35479-35487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that NOS inhibitor l-NAME attenuates both phases of endothelial barrier disruption and that eNOS knock-out inhibits hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema in mouse lungs, suggesting that increased NO release contributes to both phases of disruption of hyperoxic lung endothelial monolayer and hyperoxic lung injury. Exposure of lung endothelial cells to high concentration of oxygen leads to accumulation of a large amount of reactive oxygen species (5Allen B.W. Demchenko I.T. Piantadosi C.A. Two faces of nitric oxide: implications for cellular mechanisms of oxygen toxicity.J. Appl. Physiol. 2009; 106: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The superoxide radicals react with NO generated by eNOS and form more potent oxidizing reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite. eNOS plays an important role in peroxynitrite formation and protein tyrosine nitration in endothelial cells during hyperoxia (4Klings E.S.

In the present study, we found that peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid prevents the second phase of endothelial barrier disruption and PAEC apoptosis. Taken together, increase in NO release contributes to the first phase disruption of hyperoxic lung endothelial monolayer, and the second phase disruption of hyperoxic lung endothelial monolayer and apoptosis are attributable to the increase in peroxynitrite formation. We have previously reported that hyperoxia increases the formation of NO and peroxynitrite in lung endothelial cells via increased interaction of eNOS with β-actin in oxygen toxicity (12Kondrikov D. Elms S. Fulton D. Su Y. eNOS-β-actin interaction contributes to increased peroxynitrite formation during hyperoxia in pulmonary artery endothelial cells and mouse lungs.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35479-35487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The actin binding site on eNOS protein has been identified at amino acid residues 326–333 (13Kondrikov D. Fonseca F.V. Elms S. Fulton D. Black S.M. Block E.R.

Chem. 2010; 285: 4319-4327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutation of hydrophobic residues leucine 326, leucine 328, tryptophan 330, and leucine 333 resulted in dissociation of eNOS from β-actin, indicating that these residues are critical for actin binding (13Kondrikov D. Fonseca F.V. Elms S. Fulton D. Black S.M. Block E.R. Su Y. β-Actin association with endothelial nitric-oxide synthase modulates nitric oxide and superoxide generation from the enzyme.J. Biol.

P326TAT, a peptide with amino acid sequence corresponding to the actin binding region of eNOS residues 326–333, has been shown to readily enter endothelial cells (13Kondrikov D. Fonseca F.V. Elms S. Fulton D. Black S.M. Block E.R. Su Y. β-Actin association with endothelial nitric-oxide synthase modulates nitric oxide and superoxide generation from the enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4319-4327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Incubation of PAECs with P326TAT blocks eNOS-β-actin association in hyperoxic PAECs and subsequently reduces the hyperoxia-induced formation of NO and peroxynitrite (12Kondrikov D. Elms S. Fulton D. Su Y. eNOS-β-actin interaction contributes to increased peroxynitrite formation during hyperoxia in pulmonary artery endothelial cells and mouse lungs.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35479-35487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To study whether modulation of eNOS-β-actin interaction by P326TAT has an effect on hyperoxia-induced barrier dysfunction of lung endothelial cells, PAECs were pretreated with P326TAT or control peptide PlwTAT and then exposed to hyperoxia. We found that P326TAT attenuates hyperoxia-induced disruption of lung endothelial barrier integrity in both phases. This effect is not due to the nonspecific action of the peptide because control peptide PlwTAT does not influence the effect of hyperoxia on endothelial barrier. Moreover, P326TAT inhibits hyperoxia-induced endothelial apoptosis in the second phase of barrier disruption. Therefore, inhibition of the hyperoxia-induced formation of NO and peroxynitrite by P326TAT prevents barrier disruption and apoptosis of lung endothelial cells exposed to hyperoxia. Prolonged exposure to increased concentrations of oxygen induces diffuse pulmonary injuries, excessive inflammation, and lung fibrosis (2McGrath-Morrow S.A. Stahl J. Apoptosis in neonatal murine lung exposed to hyperoxia.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Kondrikov D. Caldwell R.B. Dong Z. Su Y. Reactive oxygen species-dependent RhoA activation mediates collagen synthesis in hyperoxic lung fibrosis.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 50: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lung vascular endothelial alterations represent the most striking pathophysiological changes in hyperoxia-induced lung injuries (25Brasch R.C. Berthezène Y. Vexler V. Rosenau W. Clément O. Mühler A. Kuwatsuru R. Shames D.M. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity: demonstration of abnormal capillary permeability using contrast-enhanced MRI.Pediatr. Radiol. 1993; 23: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the animal experiment, we found that P326TAT ameliorates endothelial apoptosis, edema, alveolar wall thickening, and inflammatory infiltrations in the lungs of mice exposed to hyperoxia. Our data provide the first evidence supporting that P326TAT is a potential novel agent to treat or prevent lung injury in oxygen toxicity. To study the mechanism that is responsible for the attenuating effect of P326TAT on hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury, we studied the effect of peptide P326TAT and control peptide PlwTAT on hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema in wild-type and eNOS knock-out mice. We found that there was no significant difference in lung morphology, lung wet/dry ratio, EBD leakage from lung vessels, and the numbers of TUNEL-positive lung endothelial cells between eNOS knock-out hyperoxic mice receiving PlwTAT and those receiving P326TAT. Thus, the attenuating effect of P326TAT on hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary edema is through eNOS. We have previously reported that mouse lungs exposed to hyperoxia exhibit increases in eNOS-β-actin association and protein tyrosine nitration (12Kondrikov D. Elms S. Fulton D. Su Y. eNOS-β-actin interaction contributes to increased peroxynitrite formation during hyperoxia in pulmonary artery endothelial cells and mouse lungs.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35479-35487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our current observations show that P326TAT reduces hyperoxia-induced increases in eNOS-β-actin association and protein tyrosine nitration in mouse lungs. Therefore, peroxynitrite formation caused by increased eNOS activity because of eNOS-β-actin association plays an important role in lung vascular endothelial damage in hyperoxic lung injuries. Apoptosis occurs in a caspase-dependent and -independent fashion. Chromatin condensation and DNA degradation triggered by AIF represent the most important caspase-independent apoptotic pathway (26Delavallée L. Cabon L. Galán-Malo P. Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. AIF-mediated caspase-independent necroptosis: a new chance for targeted therapeutics.IUBMB. Life. 2011; 63: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We found that caspase-3 activity is increased and AIF protein level in nuclei is significantly higher in PAECs exposed to hyperoxia. Furthermore, P326TAT prevents increases in caspase-3 activity and nuclear AIF protein level in hyperoxic PAECs, suggesting that inhibition of peroxynitrite formation by P326TAT prevents both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis. These results provide further evidence that inhibition of peroxynitrite formation by P326TAT prevents hyperoxia-induced lung endothelial injury in oxygen toxicity. In summary, we have shown that inhibition of NO and peroxynitrite formation by peptide P326TAT prevents barrier disruption and apoptosis of lung endothelial cells exposed to hyperoxia. P326TAT attenuates nitrosative stress, endothelial apoptosis, and pulmonary edema in hyperoxic lungs. P326TAT can be a novel therapeutic agent to treat or prevent acute lung injury in oxygen toxicity. We thank Weihong Han and Mary Louise Meadows for technology assistance in the animal experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1969817890,"Graph search is attractive for the quantitative analysis of volumetric medical images, and especially for layered tissues, because it allows globally optimal solutions in low-order polynomial time. However, because nodes of graphs typically encode evenly distributed voxels of the volume with arcs connecting orthogonally sampled voxels in Euclidean space, segmentation cannot achieve greater precision than a single unit, i.e. the distance between two adjoining nodes, and partial volume effects are ignored. We generalize the graph to non-Euclidean space by allowing non-equidistant spacing between nodes, so that subvoxel accurate segmentation is achievable. Because the number of nodes and edges in the graph remains the same, running time and memory use are similar, while all the advantages of graph search, including global optimality and computational efficiency, are retained. A deformation field calculated from the volume data adaptively changes regional node density so that node density varies with the inverse of the expected cost. We validated our approach using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the retina and 3-D MR of the arterial wall, and achieved statistically significant increased accuracy. Our approach allows improved accuracy in volume data acquired with the same hardware, and also, preserved accuracy with lower resolution, more cost-effective, image acquisition equipment. The method is not limited to any specific imaging modality and readily extensible to higher dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W2023719514,"The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle reabsorbs 30% of the NaCl filtered through the glomerulus. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by NO synthase 3 (NOS3) inhibits NaCl absorption by this segment. Resveratrol, a polyphenol, has beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects, many of which are mediated by NO. Resveratrol increases intracellular Ca2+ (Cai) and AMP kinase (AMPK) and NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) activities, all of which could activate NO production. We hypothesized that resveratrol stimulates NO production by thick ascending limbs via a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent mechanism. To test this, the effect of resveratrol on NO bioavailability was measured in thick ascending limb suspensions. Cai was measured in single perfused thick ascending limbs. SIRT1 activity and expression were measured in thick ascending limb lysates. Resveratrol (100 µM) increased NO bioavailability in thick ascending limb suspensions by 1.3±0.2 AFU/mg/min (p<0.03). The NOS inhibitor L-NAME blunted resveratrol-stimulated NO bioavailability by 96±11% (p<0.03). The superoxide scavenger tempol had no effect. Resveratrol elevated Cai from 48±7 to 135±24 nM (p<0.01) in single tubules. In Ca2+-free media, the resveratrol-induced increase in NO was blunted by 60±20% (p<0.05) and the rise in Cai reduced by 80%. Calmodulin inhibition prevented the resveratrol-induced increase in NO (p<0.002). AMPK inhibition had no effect. Resveratrol did not increase SIRT1 activity. We conclude that resveratrol increases NO production in thick ascending limbs via a Ca2+/calmodulin dependent mechanism, and SIRT1 and AMPK do not participate. Resveratrol-stimulated NO production in thick ascending limbs may account for part of its beneficial effects."
https://openalex.org/W1988368417,"Background Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly aggressive bone cancer affecting children and young adults. Growing evidence connects the invasive potential of OS cells with their ability to form invadopodia (structures specialized in extracellular matrix proteolysis). Results In this study, we tested the hypothesis that commonly used in vitro stimulators of mineralization limit the invadopodia formation in OS cells. Here we examined the invasive potential of human osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2) and osteolytic-like (143B) OS cells treated with the stimulators of mineralization (ascorbic acid and B-glycerophosphate) and observed a significant difference in response of the tested cells to the treatment. In contrast to 143B cells, osteoblast-like cells developed a mineralization phenotype that was accompanied by a decreased proliferation rate, prolongation of the cell cycle progression and apoptosis. On the other hand, stimulators of mineralization limited osteolytic-like OS cell invasiveness into collagen matrix. We are the first to evidence the ability of 143B cells to degrade extracellular matrix to be driven by invadopodia. Herein, we show that this ability of osteolytic-like cells in vitro is limited by stimulators of mineralization. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that mineralization competency determines the invasive potential of cancer cells. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which stimulators of mineralization regulate and execute invadopodia formation would reveal novel clinical targets for treating osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2000795337,"Background Physical inactivity remains an under-researched field in terms of studying burden of disease at provincial level, and no studies have examined the effects of inactivity on life expectancy (LE) in China. The purpose of this study was to estimate mortality risk and LE effects associated with insufficient levels of physical activity in Jiangxi province. Methods/Findings Prevalence of risk factors and mortality counts were extracted from Chronic Diseases and Risk Factors Surveillance Survey (CDRFSS) and Disease Surveillance Points system (DSP), respectively. Insufficient physical activity (IPA) was defined as less than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 60 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, accumulated across work, home, transport and discretionary domains. Population-attributable fractions (PAF) were used to calculate the mortality attributable to risk factors, and life table methods were used to estimate the LE gains and LE shifts. Monte Carlo simulation techniques were used for uncertainty analysis. Overall, 5 885 (95% uncertainly interval (UI), 5 047–6 506) and 8 578 (95% UI, 8 227–9 789) deaths in Jiangxi province were attributable to IPA in 2007 and 2010, respectively. The LE gains for elimination of attributable deaths were 0.68 (95% UI, 0.61–076) in 2007, and increased to 0.91 (95% UI, 0.81–1.10) in 2010. If the prevalence of IPA in 2010 had been decreased by 50% or 30%, 3 678 (95% UI, 3 220–4 229) or 2 090 (95% UI, 1 771–2 533) deaths would be avoided, and 0.40 (95% UI, 0.34–0.53) or 0.23 (95% UI, 0.16–0.31) years of LE gained, respectively. Conclusions Adults in Jiangxi province of China have a high and increasing prevalence of IPA. Due to the deaths and potential LE gains associated with IPA, there is an urgent need to promote physical activity, one of the most modifiable risk factors, within China's health care reform agenda."
https://openalex.org/W2007487495,"Purpose This study investigated the effect of Melissa officinalis extract on laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a rat model. The mechanism by which M. officinalis extract acted was also investigated. Methods Experimental CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation in Brown Norway rats. An active fraction of the Melissa leaf extract was orally administered (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) beginning 3 days before laser photocoagulation and ending 14 days after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography were performed in vivo to evaluate the thickness and leakage of CNV. Choroidal flat mount and histological analysis were conducted to observe the CNV in vitro. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 expression were measured in retinal and choroidal-scleral lysates 7 days after laser injury. Moreover, the effect of M. officinalis extract on tertiary-butylhydroperoxide (t-BH)-induced VEGF secretion and mRNA levels of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were evaluated in human retinal epithelial cells (ARPE-19) as well as in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Results The CNV thickness in M. officinalis-treated rats was significantly lower than in vehicle-treated rats by histological analysis. The CNV thickness was 33.93±7.64 µm in the high-dose group (P<0.001), 44.09±12.01 µm in the low-dose group (P = 0.016), and 51.00±12.37 µm in the control group. The proportion of CNV lesions with clinically significant fluorescein leakage was 9.2% in rats treated with high-dose M. officinalis, which was significantly lower than in control rats (53.4%, P<0.001). The levels of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were significantly lower in the high-dose group than in the control group. Meanwhile, M. officinalis extract suppressed t-BH-induced transcription of VEGF and MMP-9 in ARPE-19 cells and HUVECs. Conclusions Systemic administration of M. officinalis extract suppressed laser-induced CNV formation in rats. Inhibition of VEGF and MMP-9 via anti-oxidative activity may underlie this effect."

We start from empirical results reported in the literature on group rationality as collective group level competence and use data on real-life groups of four and five to validate a mathematical model. We then use this mathematical model to predict group level scores from a variety of possible group configurations (varying both in cognitive distance and average individual rationality). Our results show that both group competence and cognitive distance are necessary conditions for emergent group rationality. Group configurations, in which the groups become more rational than the most rational group member, are groups scoring low on cognitive distance and scoring high on absorptive capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1984843868,"The electron density at the positron (contact density) in the ground state positronium (Ps) formed in condensed matter is generally found to be lower than in vacuum. This is usually attributed to microscopic electric fields which polarize Ps, by acting on the two particles of the atom. In this paper we quantitatively investigate an opposite effect. It is due to the confinement of Ps in small cavities existing in the host solid (e.g. free volume in polymers), which increases the contact density. Although this phenomenon is greater, the smaller is the size of the cavity, Ps polarization seems to play anyway a predominant role."
https://openalex.org/W2016536289,"We sought to develop placental growth factor as a predictive pharmacodynamic biomarker for motesanib efficacy as first-line therapy in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.Placental growth factor was evaluated at baseline and study week 4 (after 3 weeks treatment) in an exploratory analysis of data from a randomized phase 2 study of motesanib 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel and in a prespecified analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind phase 3 study of motesanib 125 mg once daily plus carboplatin/paclitaxel vs placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (MONET1). Associations between fold-change from baseline in placental growth factor and overall survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.In the phase 2 study, serum placental growth factor increased from baseline a mean 2.8-fold at study week 4. Patients with ≥2.2-fold change from baseline in placental growth factor (n = 18) had significantly longer overall survival than those with <2.2-fold change (n = 19; 22.9 vs 7.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.74; P = 0.009). Consequently, placental growth factor was investigated as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in the phase 3 MONET1 study. There was no association between log-transformed placental growth factor fold-change from baseline to week 4 (continuous variable) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79-1.22; P = 0.868). MONET1 did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. Likewise, median overall survival was similar among patients with ≥2.0-fold change in placental growth factor (n = 229) compared with <2.0-fold change (n = 127; 14.8 vs 13.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.67-1.15, P = 0.340).Our results illustrate the challenges of successfully translating phase 2 biomarker results into phase 3 studies.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00460317, NCT00369070."
https://openalex.org/W2017125531,"The genetics of hypertension has been scrutinized in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with a large number of common genetic variants identified, each exerting subtle effects on disease susceptibility. An amino acid polymorphism, p.Arg82Cys, in CD300LG was recently found to be associated with fasting HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The polymorphism has not been detected in hypertension GWAS potentially due to its low frequency, but CD300LG has been linked to blood pressure as CD300LG knockout mice have changes in blood pressure. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was obtained in human CD300LG CT-carriers to follow up on these observations.Twenty healthy male CD300LG rs72836561 CT-carriers matched for age and BMI with 20 healthy male CC-carriers. Office blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and fasting blood samples were evaluated. The clinical study was combined with a genetic-epidemiological study to replicate the association between blood pressure and CD300LG Arg82Cys in 2,637 men and 3,249 women.CT-carriers had a higher 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (122 mmHg versus 115; p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (77 mmHg versus 72; p<0.01) compared with CC-carriers. There were no differences in CIMT between the two groups. Metalloproteinase-9 level was higher in CT-carriers than in CC-carriers (P<0.01). However, no association between office blood pressure and CD300LG genotype was detected in the genetic-epidemiological study.Although 24-hour blood pressure, measured with a sensitive method, in a small sample of CD300LG rs72836561 CT-carriers was higher than in CC-carriers, this did not translate into significant differences in office blood pressure in a larger cohort. This discrepancy which may reflect differences in methodological approach, underlines the importance of performing replication studies in a larger clinical context, but a formal rejection of a relation between blood pressure and CD300LG requires measurement of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in a larger cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2093071157,"In their natural habitat, the peripheral nerve, Schwann cells (SCs) form nicely aligned pathways (also known as the bands of Büngner) that guide regenerating axons to their targets. Schwann cells that are implanted in the lesioned spinal cord fail to align in pathways that could support axon growth but form cellular clusters that exhibit only limited intermingling with the astrocytes and meningeal cells (MCs) that are present in the neural scar. The formation of cell clusters can be studied in co-cultures of SCs and MCs. In these co-cultures SCs form cluster-like non-overlapping cell aggregates with well-defined boundaries. There are several indications that neuropilins (NRPs) play an important role in MC-induced SC aggregation. Both SCs and MCs express NRP1 and NRP2 and SCs express the NRP ligands Sema3B, C and E while MCs express Sema3A, C, E and F. We now demonstrate that in SC-MC co-cultures, siRNA mediated knockdown of NRP2 in SCs decreased the formation of SC clusters while these SCs maintained their capacity to align in bands of Büngner-like columnar arrays. Unexpectedly, knockdown of NRP1 expression resulted in a significant increase in SC aggregation. These results suggest that a reduction in NRP2 expression may enhance the capacity of implanted SCs to interact with MCs that invade a neural scar formed after a lesion of the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2013327718,"The mechanisms underlying acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment failure are not clear. Here, we established a mouse model of AML by syngeneic transplantation of BXH-2 derived myeloid leukemic cells and developed an efficacious Ara-C-based regimen for treatment of these mice. We proved that leukemic cell load was correlated with survival. We also demonstrated that the susceptibility of leukemia cells to Ara-C could significantly affect the survival. To examine the molecular alterations in cells with different sensitivity, genome-wide expression of the leukemic cells was profiled, revealing that overall 366 and 212 genes became upregulated or downregulated, respectively, in the resistant cells. Many of these genes are involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Some of them were further validated by quantitative PCR. Interestingly, the Ara-C resistant cells retained the sensitivity to ABT-737, an inhibitor of anti-apoptosis proteins, and treatment with ABT-737 prolonged the life span of mice engrafted with resistant cells. These results suggest that leukemic load and intrinsic cellular resistance can affect the outcome of AML treated with Ara-C. Incorporation of apoptosis inhibitors, such as ABT-737, into traditional cytotoxic regimens merits consideration for the treatment of AML in a subset of patients with resistance to Ara-C. This work provided direct in vivo evidence that leukemic load and intrinsic cellular resistance can affect the outcome of AML treated with Ara-C, suggesting that incorporation of apoptosis inhibitors into traditional cytotoxic regimens merits consideration for the treatment of AML in a subset of patients with resistance to Ara-C."
https://openalex.org/W2076785891,"Background Drug resistance (DR) of HIV-1 can be examined genotypically or phenotypically. Although sequencing is the gold standard of the genotypic resistance testing (GRT), high-throughput GRT targeted to the codons responsible for DR may be more appropriate for epidemiological studies and public health research. Methods We used a Japanese database to design and synthesize sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) for the detection of wild-type sequences and 6 DR mutations in the clade B HIV-1 reverse transcriptase region. We coupled SSOP to microbeads of the Luminex 100 xMAP system and developed a GRT based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-SSOP-Luminex method. Results Sixteen oligoprobes for discriminating DR mutations from wild-type sequences at 6 loci were designed and synthesized, and their sensitivity and specificity were confirmed using isogenic plasmids. The PCR-SSOP-Luminex DR assay was then compared to direct sequencing using 74 plasma specimens from treatment-naïve patients or those on failing treatment. In the majority of specimens, the results of the PCR-SSOP-Luminex DR assay were concordant with sequencing results: 62/74 (83.8%) for M41, 43/74 (58.1%) for K65, 70/74 (94.6%) for K70, 55/73 (75.3%) for K103, 63/73 (86.3%) for M184 and 68/73 (93.2%) for T215. There were a number of specimens without any positive signals, especially for K65. The nucleotide position of A2723G, A2747G and C2750T were frequent polymorphisms for the wild-type amino acids K65, K66 and D67, respectively, and 14 specimens had the D67N mutation encoded by G2748A. We synthesized 14 additional oligoprobes for K65, and the sensitivity for K65 loci improved from 43/74 (58.1%) to 68/74 (91.9%). Conclusions We developed a rapid high-throughput assay for clade B HIV-1 DR mutations, which could be customized by synthesizing oligoprobes suitable for the circulating viruses. The assay could be a useful tool especially for public health research in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings."
