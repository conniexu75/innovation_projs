https://openalex.org/W2010797000,"Imaging spectrometry, a new technique for the remote sensing of the earth, is now technically feasible from aircraft and spacecraft. The initial results show that remote, direct identification of surface materials on a picture-element basis can be accomplished by proper sampling of absorption features in the reflectance spectrum. The airborne and spaceborne sensors are capable of acquiring images simultaneously in 100 to 200 contiguous spectral bands. The ability to acquire laboratory-like spectra remotely is a major advance in remote sensing capability. Concomitant advances in computer technology for the reduction and storage of such potentially massive data sets are at hand, and new analytic techniques are being developed to extract the full information content of the data. The emphasis on the deterministic approach to multispectral data analysis as opposed to the statistical approaches used in the past should stimulate the development of new digital image-processing methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W1970453141,"The Infrared Thermal Mappers aboard the two Viking orbiters obtained solar reflectance and infrared emission measurements of the Martian north and south polar regions during an entire Mars year. The observations were used to determine annual radiation budgets, infer annual carbon dioxide frost budgets, and constrain spring season surface and atmospheric properties with the aid of a polar radiative model. The results provide further confirmation of the presence of permanent CO(2)frost deposits near the south pole and show that the stability of these deposits can be explained by their high reflectivities. In the north, the observed absence of solid CO(2) during summer was primarily the result of enhanced CO(2) sublimation rates due to lower frost reflectivities during spring. The results suggest that the present asymmetric behavior of CO(2)frost at the Martian poles is caused by preferential contamination of the north seasonal polar cap by atmospheric dust."

https://openalex.org/W2069504450,"The first eclipses between Pluto and its satellite (""Charon"") were detected in January and February 1985, confirming the satellite's existence. Eclipses lasting a few hours will now occur at 3.2-day intervals for the next 5 to 6 years and then will cease for about 120 years. Careful observations of these eclipses will allow greatly improved determinations to be made of several physical parameters for the Pluto-Charon system: the diameters of the planet and satellite, the surface albedo distribution on one hemisphere of the planet, the orbit of the satellite, and the mass of the planet and hence its density. Knowledge of the density will provide a constraint on models of Pluto's bulk composition."
