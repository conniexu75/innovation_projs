https://openalex.org/W2954355604,"Summary Motivated behavior is influenced by neural networks that integrate physiological needs. Here, we describe coordinated regulation of hypothalamic feeding and midbrain reward circuits in awake behaving mice. We find that alcohol and other non-nutritive drugs inhibit activity in hypothalamic feeding neurons. Interestingly, nutrients and drugs utilize different pathways for the inhibition of hypothalamic neuron activity, as alcohol signals hypothalamic neurons in a vagal-independent manner, while fat and satiation signals require the vagus nerve. Concomitantly, nutrients, alcohol, and drugs also increase midbrain dopamine signaling. We provide evidence that these changes are interdependent, as modulation of either hypothalamic neurons or midbrain dopamine signaling influences reward-evoked activity changes in the other population. Taken together, our results demonstrate that (1) food and drugs can engage at least two peripheral→central pathways to influence hypothalamic neuron activity, and (2) hypothalamic and dopamine circuits interact in response to rewards."

Methods The Medicaid Analytic extracts database was used to identify adult SCD patients using claims from 01JUL2009-31DEC2012. The date of the first observed SCD claim was designated as the index date. Patients were required to have continuous medical and pharmacy benefits for ≥6 months baseline and ≥12 months follow-up period. Patient demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, the rate of uncomplicated and complicated VOC (VOC with concomitant SCD complications) episodes, and reasons for ER visits and inpatient stays were analyzed descriptively. Results A total of 8,521 patients were included in the analysis, with a median age of 30 years. The average follow-up period was 2.7 years. The rate of VOC episodes anytime in the follow-up was 3.31 in person-years. During the first-year follow-up period, an average of 2.79 VOC episodes were identified per SCD patients, with 1.06 VOC episodes treated in inpatient setting and 0.90 VOC episodes in ER without admission. A total of 76,154 VOC episodes were identified during the entire follow-up period for the overall SCD patients. Most of the VOC episodes (70.3% [n = 53,523]) were uncomplicated episodes, and 29.7% were complicated episodes. Using primary diagnosis claims only, the most frequent complications during the VOC episode were infectious diseases (25.9%), fever (21.8%), and pulmonary disorders (16.2%). Among ER and hospitalizations related to VOC or SCD complication, ~85.0% had VOCs as the primary reason for admission; 15.0% had SCD complications as the primary reason. Conclusion In summary, SCD and its related comorbidities and complications result in high acute health care utilization. In addition, VOC remains the primary reason for SCD patients’ ER visits and inpatient admissions."
https://openalex.org/W2953821351,"Drought has become one of the most serious abiotic stresses influencing crop production worldwide. Understanding the molecular regulatory networks underlying drought adaption and tolerance in crops is of great importance for future breeding. microRNAs (miRNAs), as important components of post-transcriptional regulation, play crucial roles in drought response and adaptation in plants. Here, we report a miRNome analysis of two maize inbred lines with contrasting levels of drought tolerance under soil drought in the field. Differential expression analysis showed 11 and 34 miRNAs were uniquely responded to drought in H082183 (drought tolerant) and Lv28 (drought sensitive), respectively, in leaves. In roots, 19 and 23 miRNAs uniquely responded to drought in H082183 and Lv28, respectively. Expression analysis of these drought-responsive miRNA-mRNA modules revealed miR164-MYB, miR164-NAC, miR159-MYB, miR156-SPL and miR160-ARF showed a negative regulatory relationship. Further analysis showed that the miR164-MYB and miR164-NAC modules in the tolerant line modulated the stress response in an ABA (abscisic acid)-dependent manner, while the miR156-SPL and miR160-ARF modules in the sensitive line participated in the inhibition of metabolism in drought-exposed leaves. Together, our results provide new insight into not only drought-tolerance-related miRNA regulation networks in maize but also key miRNAs for further characterization and improvement of maize drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2955753781,"Escherichia coli is a major cause of neonatal sepsis. Contemporary antibiotic resistance data and molecular characterization of neonatal E. coli bacteremia isolates in the US are limited.E. coli blood isolates, antibiotic susceptibility data, and clinical characteristics were obtained from prospectively identified newborns from 2006 to 2016. The E. coli isolates were classified using an updated phylogrouping method and multi-locus sequence typing. The presence of several virulence traits was also determined.Forty-three newborns with E. coli bacteremia were identified. Mean gestational age was 32.3 (SD±5.4) weeks. Median age was 7 days (interquartile range 0-10). Mortality (28%) occurred exclusively in preterm newborns. Resistance to ampicillin was 67%, to gentamicin was 14%, and to ceftriaxone was 2%; one isolate produced extended-spectrum beta lactamases. Phylogroup B2 predominated. Sequence type (ST) 95 and ST131 prevailed; ST1193 emerged recently. All isolates carried fimH, nlpI, and ompA, and 46% carried the K1 capsule. E. coli from newborns with bacteremia diagnosed at <72 hours old had more virulence genes compared to E. coli from newborns ≥ 72 hours old. The hek/hra gene was more frequent in isolates from newborns who died than in isolates from survivors.Antibiotic resistance in E. coli was prevalent in this large collection of bacteremia isolates from US newborns. Most strains belonged to distinctive extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coil phylogroups and STs. Further characterization of virulence genes in neonatal E. coli bacteremia strains is needed in larger numbers and in more geographically diverse areas."
https://openalex.org/W2955534957,"Addressing critical global health issues, such as antimicrobial resistance, infectious disease outbreaks, and natural disasters, requires strong coordination and management across sectors. The One Health approach is the integrative effort of multiple sectors working to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment, and is increasingly recognized by experts as a means to address complex challenges. However, practical application of the One Health approach has been challenging. The One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit (OH-SMART) introduced in this paper was designed using a multistage prototyping process to support systematic improvement in multi-sectoral coordination and collaboration to better address complex health concerns through an operational, stepwise, and practical One Health approach. To date, OH-SMART has been used to strengthen One Health systems in 17 countries and has been deployed to revise emergency response frameworks, improve antimicrobial resistance national action plans and create multi agency infectious disease collaboration protocols. OH-SMART has proven to be user friendly, robust, and capable of fostering multi-sectoral collaboration and complex system-wide problem solving."
https://openalex.org/W2954127837,"The elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) has been a known cause of death of young elephants in Thailand for over a decade. In this study, we report on the demography, disease characteristics and mortality of 58 elephants with confirmed EEHV hemorrhagic disease between January 2006 and August 2018 using retrospective data subjected to survival analysis. Median age of EEHV presentation was 29 months, and the mortality rate was 68.97% with a median survival time of 36 h. Most EEHV cases occurred in the north of Thailand, the region where most of the country's captive elephants reside. The hazard ratio analysis identified application of medical procedures and antiviral medications as being significant factors correlated to the risk of death. Our results indicate a need to focus EEHV monitoring efforts on young elephants and to follow current protocols that advise starting treatments before clinical signs appear."
https://openalex.org/W2955328057,"Cervids are known to be reservoirs of zoonotic bacteria transmitted by ticks. This study aimed to identify the Anaplasma species carried by captive red deer and swamp deer in a wild fauna reserve in France. Blood from 59 red deer and 7 swamp deer was collected and analyzed over a period of two years. A semi-nested PCR targeting the 23S rRNA was performed to detect and characterize Anaplasma spp. and determine the presence of zoonotic species. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was identified in 14/59 red deer (23.7%) but it was not identified in any of the swamp deer (7 animals). Three sequences could not be assigned to any particular species based on the 23S rRNA sequences. Complementary nested PCR targeting 16S rRNA, gltA and groEL genes and sequencing analysis then identified these sequences as a recently reported zoonotic species, Anaplasma capra; this species was found in 2 red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 1 swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii). This is the first report of the tick-borne zoonotic bacterium A. capra in France, a species otherwise described only in China, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea in goats, sheep, deer, cattle and Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus). While this bacterium may have been introduced into the reserve by infected imported animals, its local epidemiological cycle via tick transmission seems possible as locally born deer were found infected. Diagnostic methods, especially molecular ones, should take into account the potential infection of animals and humans with this species."
https://openalex.org/W2955392112,"Metabarcoding of feces has revolutionized the knowledge of animal diets by providing unprecedented resolution of consumed resources. However, it is still unclear how different methodological approaches influence the ecological conclusions that can be drawn from such data. Here, we propose a critical evaluation of several data treatments on the inferred diet of the bat Plecotus auritus using guano regularly collected from various colonies throughout the entire active season. First and unlike previous claims, our data indicates that DNA extracted from large amounts of fecal material issued from guano accumulates yield broader taxonomic diversity of prey than smaller numbers of pellets would do, provided that extraction buffer volumes are adapted to such increased amounts of material. Second, trophic niche analyses based on prey occurrence data uncover strong seasonality in the bat’s diet and major differences among neighboring maternity colonies. Third, while the removal of rare prey items is not always warranted as it introduces biases affecting particularly samples with greater prey species richness. Fourth, examination of distinct taxonomic depths in diet analyses highlights different aspects of food consumption providing a better understanding of the consumer’s diet. Finally, the biologically meaningful patterns recovered with presence-absence approaches are virtually lost when attempting to quantify prey consumed using relative read abundances. Even in an ideal situation where reference barcodes are available for most potential prey species, inferring realistic patterns of prey consumption remains relatively challenging. Although best practice in metabarcoding analyses will depend on the aims of the study, several previous methodological recommendations seem unwarranted for studying such diverse diets as that of brown long-eared bats."
https://openalex.org/W2954587554,"CD47 is an immune checkpoint molecule that downregulates key aspects of both the innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune response via its counter receptor SIRPα, and it is expressed at high levels in a wide variety of tumor types. This has led to the development of biologics that inhibit SIRPα engagement including humanized CD47 antibodies and a soluble SIRPα decoy receptor that are currently undergoing clinical trials. Unfortunately, toxicological issues, including anemia related to on-target mechanisms, are barriers to their clinical advancement. Another potential issue with large biologics that bind CD47 is perturbation of CD47 signaling through its high-affinity interaction with the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). One approach to avoid these shortcomings is to identify and develop small molecule molecular probes and pretherapeutic agents that would (1) selectively target SIRPα or TSP1 interactions with CD47, (2) provide a route to optimize pharmacokinetics, reduce on-target toxicity and maximize tissue penetration, and (3) allow more flexible routes of administration. As the first step toward this goal, we report the development of an automated quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) assay platform capable of screening large diverse drug-like chemical libraries to discover novel small molecules that inhibit CD47-SIRPα interaction. Using time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) and bead-based luminescent oxygen channeling assay formats (AlphaScreen), we developed biochemical assays, optimized their performance, and individually tested them in small-molecule library screening. Based on performance and low false positive rate, the LANCE TR-FRET assay was employed in a ~90,000 compound library qHTS, while the AlphaScreen oxygen channeling assay served as a cross-validation orthogonal assay for follow-up characterization. With this multi-assay strategy, we successfully eliminated compounds that interfered with the assays and identified five compounds that inhibit the CD47-SIRPα interaction; these compounds will be further characterized and later disclosed. Importantly, our results validate the large library qHTS for antagonists of CD47-SIRPα interaction and suggest broad applicability of this approach to screen chemical libraries for other protein-protein interaction modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2954111159,"Vava’u, Kingdom of Tonga, is a well-established whale-watching destination in the South Pacific. Between July and October, the waters around the archipelago represent one of the most important breeding grounds for Oceania humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The Tongan government allows tourist swimming activities with whales and tour operators strongly promote the practice of swimming-with-whales, focusing primarily on mother-calf pairs. However, there is increasing evidence, derived from empirical research on swim-with-cetacean tourism, that this kind of interaction affects cetacean behaviour and can lead to negative effects on the cetaceans involved. This study represents the first assessment of humpback whales’ behavioural responses to vessel and swimmer approaches in Vava’u. Fifty-six surveys took place during the 2016 and 2017 whale breeding seasons aboard dedicated research and tour vessels. Whale dive time, number of reorientation events, and respiration rates were documented in both the absence and presence of boats and swimmers. Vessel approach type, swimmer placement, and whale avoidance responses were also recorded. Results indicate that the average diving time and the proportion of time spent diving in the presence of swimming activities increased significantly for mother-calf pairs (F2,36 = 18.183, P < 0.001; F2,36 = 5.462, P = 0.009, respectively). Moreover, avoidance responses of whales towards tour vessels were observed for one third of vessel approaches (33.5%) and the avoidance rate was significantly affected by the boat approach type (95% CI: 20.7–69.2%, z = 3.50, P < 0.001). Finally, low levels of compliance to the existing Tongan swim-with-whales regulations were documented, in particular the stipulated whale resting time between interactions with tour operator vessels and swimmers was often not respected (38.4%). Vava’u is an important calving ground for the Oceania humpback whale population and these findings should be carefully considered by stakeholders in Tonga and at other locations where swim-with-whales opportunities are being undertaken. Effective strategies to reduce the risk of detrimental effects on the whales targeted by swimming activities, especially mother-calf pairs, are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2953653355,"Semen abnormality (SA) male infertility has become a worldwide reproductive health problem. The invasive tests (e.g., testicular biopsy) and labor-intensive methods of semen collection severely inhibit diagnosis of male infertility. In addition, the pathogenesis and biological interpretation of male infertility are still obscure. In this report, a total of 84 semen abnormality (SA) patients, diagnosed as teratozoospermia (TE, n = 21), asthenozoospermia (AS, n = 23), oligozoospermia (OL, n = 20), azoospermia (AZ, n = 20), and age-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 29) were analyzed by GC-MS for discrimination analysis and discovery of potential biomarkers. Twenty-three biomarkers were obtained by multivariate statistical method (partial least squares-discriminant analysis, PLS-DA) and univariate statistical method (analysis of variance, ANOVA) with comparisons of TE versus HC, AS versus HC, OL versus HC and AZ versus HC. Based on those biomarkers, the most relevant pathways were mainly associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. The principal metabolic alternations in SA male infertility included increased levels of energy-related metabolisms, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycine, serine, threonine metabolism and saturated fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, increased levels of glutathione metabolism were related to oxidative stress. Finally, decreased levels of arginine and proline metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism were observed. In conclusion, blood plasma metabolomics is powerful for characterizing metabolic disturbances in SA male infertility. From metabolic pathway analysis, energy production, oxidation stress and the released enzyme during spermatogenesis take the primary responsibilities for SA male infertility."

Three years of archival assessment records related to suicide attempters who were admitted to the emergency department of a large teaching hospital in Singapore were subjected to analysis. Records related to 460 suicide attempters (70.4% females; 28.6% males) were analysed using logistic regressions. Their ages ranged from 12 to 85 (M = 29.08, SD = 12.86). The strongest predictor of suicide intent was habitual poor coping, followed by serious financial problems, and expressed regret. The strongest predictor of suicide risk was hiding the attempt followed by prior planning. The findings were discussed in regards to implications in clinical assessments and suicide prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2954711913,"Mutations in EFTUD2 are responsible for the autosomal dominant syndrome named MFDM (mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly). However, it is not clear how reduced levels of EFTUD2 cause abnormalities associated with this syndrome. To determine if the mouse can serve as a model for uncovering the etiology of abnormalities found in MFDM patients, we used in situ hybridization to characterize expression of Eftud2 during mouse development, and used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a mutant mouse line with deletion of exon 2 of the mouse gene. We found that Eftud2 was expressed throughout embryonic development, though its expression was enriched in the developing head and craniofacial regions. Additionally, Eftud2 heterozygous mutant embryos had reduced EFTUD2 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, Eftud2 heterozygous embryos were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, and were viable and fertile despite being developmentally delayed. In contrast, Eftud2 homozygous mutant embryos were not found post-implantation but were present at the expected Mendelian frequency at embryonic day (E) 3.5. Furthermore, only wild-type and heterozygous E3.5 embryos survived ex vivo culture. Our data indicate that Eftud2 expression is enriched in the precusor of structures affected in MFDM patients and show that heterozygous mice carrying deletion of exon 2 do not model MFDM. In addition, we uncovered a requirement for normal levels of Eftud2 for survival of pre-implantation zygotes."
https://openalex.org/W2955651617,Cholera is a life-threatening disease caused by the cholera toxin (CT) as produced by some Vibrio cholerae serogroups. In this research we present a method which directly detects the toxin's B subunit (CTB) in drinking water. For this purpose we performed a magnetic sandwich immunoassay inside a 3D immunofiltration column. We used two different commercially available antibodies to capture CTB and for binding to superparamagnetic beads. ELISA experiments were performed to select the antibody combination. The beads act as labels for the magnetic frequency mixing detection technique. We show that the limit of detection depends on the type of magnetic beads. A nonlinear Hill curve was fitted to the calibration measurements by means of a custom-written python software. We achieved a sensitive and rapid detection of CTB within a broad concentration range from 0.2 ng/ml to more than 700 ng/ml.
https://openalex.org/W2953951822,"Thermoresponsive polymers, such as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), have been identified and used as cell culture substrates, taking advantage of the polymer’s lower critical solution temperature (LCST) to mechanically harvest cells. This technology bypasses the use of biochemical enzymes that cleave important cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In this study, the process of electrospinning is used to fabricate and characterize aligned PNIPAM nanofiber scaffolds that are biocompatible and thermoresponsive. Nanofiber scaffolds produced by electrospinning possess a 3D architecture that mimics native extracellular matrix, providing physical and chemical cues to drive cell function and phenotype. We present a factorial design of experiments (DOE) approach to systematically determine the effects of different electrospinning process parameters on PNIPAM nanofiber diameter and alignment. Results show that high molecular weight PNIPAM can be successfully electrospun into both random and uniaxially aligned nanofiber mats with similar fiber diameters by simply altering the speed of the rotating mandrel collector from 10,000 to 33,000 RPM. PNIPAM nanofibers were crosslinked with OpePOSS, which was verified using FTIR. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds were characterized using dynamic mechanical analysis, revealing an order of magnitude difference in storage modulus (MPa) between cured and uncured samples. In summary, cross-linked PNIPAM nanofiber scaffolds were determined to be stable in aqueous culture, biocompatible, and thermoresponsive, enabling their use in diverse cell culture applications."
https://openalex.org/W2954871385,"The yak is one of the most important domestic animals in Tibetan life for providing basic resources such as milk, meat and transportation. Although yak milk production is not elevated, yak milk is superior to dairy cow milk in nutrient composition (protein and fat). However, the understanding of the metabolic mechanisms of yak mammary gland tissue during the lactation cycle remains elusive. In this study, GC-MS-based metabolomics was employed to study the metabolic variations in the yak mammary gland during the lactation cycle (pregnancy, lactation and dry period). Twenty-nine metabolites were up or downregulated during the lactation period. Compared to the dry period, during the lactation period the levels of oxalic acid were upregulated, while glycine and uridine were downregulated. Thirty-seven pathways were obtained when the 29 differential metabolites were imported into the KEGG pathway analysis. The most impacted pathways during the lactation cycle were glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; TCA cycle; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; and pyrimidine metabolism. Our results provide important insights into the metabolic events involved in yak mammary gland development, lactogenesis and lactation, which can guide further research to improve milk yield and enhance the constituents of yak milk."
https://openalex.org/W2955556373,"The overall survival for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains low, with little progress made over decades. Cisplatin, most frequently used for HNSCC treatment, activates mitochondria-dependent apoptosis through the BCL-2 family proteins. We have previously demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, NOXA plays a critical role in this process. NOXA binds and inactivates anti-apoptotic MCL-1, while the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-263 is capable of inactivating anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-XL. We hypothesized that combination of NOXA and ABT-263 treatment increases cell death by simultaneously inhibiting anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins in HNSCC cells. Here, we demonstrated that combination of ectopic NOXA expression and ABT-263 enhanced apoptosis in p53-inactive, p53 wild-type, and human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive HNSCC cell lines. Furthermore, a retinoid derivative and an endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer, fenretinide, induced NOXA, and combination of fenretinide and ABT-263 strongly induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells regardless of the HPV or p53 statuses. We also found that MCL-1 and BCL-XL are the primary targets of apoptosis induced by the combinations. These results will develop novel and alternative therapeutic strategies to directly modify the cell death machinery in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2956120233,"Despite its poor bioavailability, curcumin is a promising natural polyphenol targeting NF-κβ. NF-κβ is a target for new therapeutics because it plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). In contrast, ambrsoin, a sesquiterpene lactone which is a potent NF-κβ inhibitor, is scarcely studied in AD models. The current work aims to assess the efficacy of ambrosin as a possible remedy for AD. In silico studies showed that bioavailability and BBB permeability could be favorable for ambrosin over curcumin. Memory impairment was induced in mice by single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.4 mg/kg). Treated groups received curcumin (100 mg/kg) or ambrosin at doses (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 7 days. Mice in treated groups showed a significant improvement in memory functions during Morris water maze and object recognition tests. Curcumin and ambrosin (10 mg/kg) inhibited the upsurge of NF-κβp65 transcript and protein levels. Consequently, downstream pro-inflammatory and nitrosative mediators were inhibited, namely, TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2 and iNOS. BACE1 was inhibited, thereby reducing amyloid plaques (Aβ) deposition and eventually reducing inflammation and apoptosis of neurons as revealed by immunohistopathological examination. In conclusion, ambrosin can be repurposed as AD remedy after further pharmacokinetic/pharamacodynamic assessments. It could serve as an additional lead drug for AD therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2953822726,"Objective Latino immigrants experience acculturative stress and increased depression risk. Mindfulness meditation improves depressive symptoms, yet the vast majority of research has focused on English speaking populations. Methods In this randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel treatment groups, adults with moderate levels of perceived stress (n = 76) were recruited from the Los Angeles community from October 2015 to March 2016, stratified into Spanish- (n = 36) and English speaking (n = 40) language groups, and randomized for 6 weeks of treatment with standardized mindful awareness practices (MAPs) or health education (HE). Main outcome measure was depressive symptoms, measured by the Beck Depression Inventory. Results Using an intent-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome, depressive symptoms as indexed by the Beck Depression Inventory, showed greater improvement in MAPs vs. HE, with a between-group post-intervention mean difference of -2.2 (95% CI -4.4 – -0.07) and effect size of 0.28; similar effect sizes were found in the the Spanish- (0.29) and English speaking (0.30) groups. MAPs showed significant improvement relative to HE on secondary outcome of mindfulness with between group difference of 10.7 (95% CI4.5–16.9), but not perceived stress. Conclusion The comparable efficacy of Spanish and English formats of mindfulness meditation in improving depressive symptoms suggests that this community based intervention may mitigate depression risk in Latino adults who are experiencing social adversity.

https://openalex.org/W2955645290,"Background The incidence of severe complications such as burr entrapment or perforation is considerable with rotational atherectomy (RA). Halfway RA is a novel strategy, in which an operator does not advance the burr to the end of a continuous calcified lesion, and performs balloon dilatation to treat the remaining part of the calcified lesion. The purpose of this study was to compare complications after halfway and conventional RA. Methods We included 307 consecutive lesions that were divided into a conventional RA group (n = 244) and halfway RA group (n = 63). In analysis 1, the incidence of complications was compared between the conventional RA and halfway RA groups. Propensity-score matching was used to match the intentional halfway RA and conventional RA. In analysis 2, the incidence of complications was compared between the matched conventional RA and intentional halfway RA groups. Results Burr entrapment (0.4%) and major perforation (0.8%) were observed in the conventional RA group, whereas there was no burr entrapment or perforation in the halfway RA group. The success rate of halfway RA was 90.5%, which required switching from halfway RA to conventional RA. The incidences of slow flow and periprocedural myocardial infarction with slow flow were similar between the intentional halfway RA and matched conventional RA groups. Conclusions There was no burr entrapment or vessel perforation following halfway RA. The incidences of slow flow and periprocedural myocardial infarction were similar between the intentional halfway RA and the matched conventional RA, indicating the safety of halfway RA."
https://openalex.org/W2953903029,"Strength training is crucial for soccer players' long-term development at early ages and the biological maturation may influence specific strength-training adaptations. The aim of this study was to propose a strength-training programme for the strength development of pre-pubertal players and to analyse the adaptations to this training programme in players with different maturity status. One hundred and thirty young male soccer players participated in an 8-week strength-training programme consisting of two sessions per week (20-minutes of a combination of plyometric and resistance exercises) which was conducted prior to their normal soccer training. Three maturity groups were defined according to the years from/to their peak height velocity (PHV) as Pre-, Mid- and Post-PHV. Initial differences between the maturity groups were found in anthropometrical (weight and height) and physical performance variables (One Repetition Maximum (RM), Peak Power output (PP), 30-m sprint and T-test). The strength-training programme was beneficial for the three maturity groups (p< 0.05) with general greater improvements for the Pre- and Mid-PHV groups, with large effects in RM, PP and T-test, than for the Post-PHV group (moderate effects). The strength-training programme proposed in the present study seems to be positive for the strength-related development in young soccer players especially for Pre- and Mid-PHV players. The differences in the training adaptations for players with different maturity status suggest the individualization of the training stimulus for the correct long-term development of the players."
https://openalex.org/W2954883601,"Amplification of a CAG trinucleotide motif (CTG18.1) within the TCF4 gene has been strongly associated with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD). Nevertheless, a small minority of clinically unaffected elderly patients who have expanded CTG18.1 sequences have been identified. To test the hypothesis that the CAG expansions in these patients are protected from FECD because they have interruptions within the CAG repeats, we utilized a combination of an amplification-free, long-read sequencing method and a new target-enrichment sequence analysis tool developed by Pacific Biosciences to interrogate the sequence structure of expanded repeats. The sequencing was successful in identifying a previously described interruption within an unexpanded allele and provided sequence data on expanded alleles greater than 2000 bases in length. The data revealed considerable heterogeneity in the size distribution of expanded repeats within each patient. Detailed analysis of the long sequence reads did not reveal any instances of interruptions to the expanded CAG repeats, but did reveal novel variants within the AGG repeats that flank the CAG repeats in two of the five samples from clinically unaffected patients with expansions. This first examination of the sequence structure of CAG repeats in CTG18.1 suggests that factors other than interruptions to the repeat structure account for the absence of disease in some elderly patients with repeat expansions in the TCF4 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2954189287,"In fish, the circadian clock represents a key regulator of many aspects of biology and is controlled by combinations of abiotic and biotic factors. These environmental factors are frequently manipulated in fish farms as part of strategies designed to maximize productivity. The flatfish turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, represents one of the most important species within the aquaculture sector in Asia and Europe. Despite the strategic importance of this species, the function and regulation of the turbot circadian system remains poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the core circadian clock genes, clock1, per1, per2 and cry1 in turbot and have studied their daily expression in various tissues under a range of lighting conditions and feeding regimes. We have also explored the influence of light and feeding time on locomotor activity. Rhythmic expression of the four core clock genes was observed in all tissues studied under light dark (LD) cycle conditions. Rhythmicity of clock gene expression persisted upon transfer to artificial free running, constant conditions confirming their endogenous circadian clock control. Furthermore, turbot showed daily cycles of locomotor activity and food anticipatory activity (FAA) under LD and scheduled-feeding, with the activity phase as well as FAA coinciding with and being dependent upon exposure to light. Thus, while FAA was absent under constant dark (DD) conditions, it was still detected in constant light (LL). In contrast, general locomotor activity was arrhythmic in both constant darkness and constant light, pointing to a major contribution of light, in concert with the circadian clock, in timing locomotor activity in this species. Our data represents an important contribution to our understanding of the circadian timing system in the turbot and thereby the optimization of rearing protocols and the improvement of the well-being of turbot within fish farming environments."

In three studies (total N = 1,151), participants distributed two tasks (one favorable and one unfavorable) between themselves and an anonymous partner, with the option of using an ostensibly fair randomizer (e.g., a self-prepared coin). We found that when experiencing feelings of moral superiority (vs. non-superiority), people, especially those who highly identified with moral values (Studies 1 and 2), were less likely to directly give themselves the favorable task, but they were not less likely to cheat in private after using the randomizer (Studies 1 to 3). Both self-enhancement motives and moral identity have implications for hypocritical behavior, by motivating public moral appearances but not private moral integrity."

A competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay for the detection of antibodies was used to determine the distribution of past flavivirus infections over time, while Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect active West Nile Virus (WNV) and Dengue virus (DENV) infections. The first serological evidence of flavivirus in these animals was determined in 1993, at the same time when DENV re-emerged in humans from Costa Rica. An increase in the number of seropositive wild monkeys to flavivirus was determined over time in the country (11.3% seropositivity in 1993–1996, 20.7% in 2001–2008, and finally 52.9% in 2010–2012). Furthermore, the presence of DENV2 was detected in samples from four howler monkeys collected in 2001–2002, whereas DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 were found in samples from four white-faced monkeys, and WNV in three howler monkeys living in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica during 2010–2012. The habitat where the positive PCR individuals lived were characterized as fragmented forests, having temperatures ranging from 26°C to 28°C, altitudes below 250 meters above sea level, high precipitation during 7 to 9 months (1500–4000 mm), and a marked dry season of 3 to 5 months. All these animals were living near mangroves; however, they did not show clinical signs of illness at the time of sampling. Results obtained show that the number of seropositive wild non-human primates to flavivirus were increasing during time in the country, longitudinal studies are needed to investigate their role as sentinels of these viruses and to determine if flavivirus infections can affect these species."
https://openalex.org/W2953501412,"Recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, is widely used for treatment of fertility disorders and is subject to biosimilars development. Cell lines with high specific productivities may simplify the FSH production process. Here, we used our previously established expression system based on vector p1.1 to create new cell lines secreting heterodimeric FSH protein. To this end, we linked open reading frames of both FSH subunits by the wild-type internal ribosome entry site from the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV IRES). Intact and double-negative for the dihydrofolate reductase CHO cells were stably transfected by the FSH-coding plasmids. Stably transfected intact cells showed higher level of the FSH secretion and were utilized for subsequent methotrexate-driven transgene amplification, which doubled their productivity. The excess of the free α-subunit was corrected by transfecting the cells by the additional p1.1-based plasmid encoding the β-subunit of the FSH. Clonal cell lines obtained secreted mostly the heterodimeric FSH and possessed specific productivities up to 12.3±1.7 pg/cell/day. Candidate clonal cell line C-P1.3-FSH-G4 maintained a constant specific productivity for at least 2 months of culturing without the section pressure. The resulting FSH protein conformed to the international pharmaceutical quality criteria as evidenced by the receptor binding kinetics, distribution pattern of hormone isoforms and biological activity. In conclusion, our expression system offers a simple and cost-effective approach to production of FSH."
https://openalex.org/W2954065878,"Diabetic neuropathy is common and disabling despite glycemic control. Novel neuroprotective approaches are needed. Thrombin and hypercoagulability are associated with diabetes and nerve conduction dysfunction. Our aim was to study the role of thrombin in diabetic neuropathy. We measured thrombin activity by a biochemical assay in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Neuropathy severity was assessed by thermal latency and nerve conduction measures. Thermal latencies were longer in diabetic rats, and improved with the non-specific serine-protease inhibitor Tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) treatment (p<0.01). The tail nerve of diabetic rats showed slow conduction velocity (p˂0.01), and interestingly, increased thrombin activity was noted in the sciatic nerve (p˂0.001). Sciatic nodes of Ranvier and the thrombin receptor, protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) reactivity showed abnormal morphology in diabetic animals by immunofluorescence staining (p<0.0001). Treatment of diabetic animals with either the specific thrombin inhibitor, N-alpha 2 naphtalenesulfonylglycyl alpha-4 amidino-phenylalaninepiperidide (NAPAP) or TLCK preserved normal conduction velocity, (p˂0.01 and p = 0.01 respectively), and prevented disruption of morphology (p˂0.05 and p˂0.03). The results establish for the first time an association between diabetic neuropathy and excessive activation of the thrombin pathway. Treatment of diabetic animals with thrombin inhibitors ameliorates both biochemical, structural and electrophysiological deficits. The thrombin pathway inhibition may be a novel neuroprotective therapeutic target in the diabetic neuropathy pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2954226214,"Psychosis is a multifactorial condition arising from an interaction between genetic liability and exposure to environmental risk factors, in particular childhood trauma. Furthermore, accumulating evidence supports a role for the immune system in the aetiology of psychosis. Increased peripheral levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced neurotrophic factors are found in patients with psychosis. Childhood trauma is highly prevalent in psychosis patients and is also associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced neurotrophic factors. Recent studies suggest the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and decrease in neurotrophic factors seen in psychosis may be attributable to the effects of child maltreatment. The aim of this study was to improve understanding of the relation between childhood trauma, inflammation and psychosis. We examined separate and interaction effects of psychosis liability and childhood trauma on serum levels of BDNF, CCL-2, CRP, IFN-γ, IGFBP2, IL-6, PDGF, SCF and TNF-α in 40 patients with recent onset psychosis, 13 patients at Ultra-High Risk (UHR) for psychosis, 31 unaffected siblings of psychosis patients and 41 healthy controls. Childhood trauma was assessed retrospectively with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). No statistically significant effects of psychosis liability or childhood trauma on concentrations of cytokines or growth factors in peripheral blood were found, nor were there any statistically significant interaction effects of psychosis liability with childhood trauma on serum levels of cytokines and growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2953454424,"Plant life cycle begins with germination of seed below the ground. This is followed by seedling's development in the dark: skotomorphogenesis; and then a light-mediated growth: photomorphogenesis. After germination, hypocotyl grows rapidly to reach the sun, which involves elongation of shoot at the expense of root and cotyledons. Upon reaching ground level, seedling gets exposed to sunlight following a switch from the etiolated (skotomorphogenesis) to the de-etiolated (photomorphogenesis) stage, involving a series of molecular and physiological changes. Gymnosperms have evolved very differently and adopted diverse strategies as compared to angiosperms; with regards to response to light quality, conifers display a very mild high-irradiance response as compared to angiosperms. Absence of apical hook and synthesis of chlorophyll during skotomorphogenesis are two typical features in gymnosperms which differentiate them from angiosperms (dicots). Information regarding etiolation and de-etiolation processes are well understood in angiosperms, but these mechanisms are less explored in conifer species. It is, therefore, interesting to know how similar these processes are in conifers as compared to angiosperms. We performed a global expression analysis (RNA sequencing) on etiolated and de-etiolated seedlings of two economically important conifer species in Sweden to review the differentially expressed genes associated with the two processes. Based on the results, we propose that high levels of HY5 in conifers under DARK condition coupled with expression of few other genes associated with de-etiolation in angiosperms e.g. SPA, DET1 (lower expression under DARK) and CRY1 (higher expression under DARK), leads to partial expression of photomorphogenic genes in the DARK phenotype in conifers as displayed by absence of apical hook, opening of cotyledons and synthesis of chlorophyll."

However, the role of hormonal contraceptives in S. aureus colonization among adolescents and associations with progestin only contraceptives are unknown. Methods We obtained nasal and throat swab samples from 439 girls aged 17–21 years in the population-based Tromsø study Fit Futures, 2012–2013, Norway, with information on lifestyle, health and biomarkers. We used multivariable logistic regression to study the association between use of hormonal contraceptives and Staphylococcus aureus carriage while adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage prevalence were 34%, 42%, and 61% among progestin-only users, non-users, and progestin-estrogen combination contraceptive users, respectively (P<0.001). Use of combination contraceptives doubled the odds of nasal carriage (non-users reference; OR = 2.31, 95%CI = 1.43–3.74). The OR of nasal carriage was 0.29 among progestin-only users compared to combination contraceptives users (95% CI = 0.12–0.67). Discussion In this study, use of combination hormonal contraceptives was associated with higher risk of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in adolescent girls. Experimental design studies are needed to establish the role of exogenous sex steroids in Staphylococcus aureus colonization in women."
https://openalex.org/W2953928837,"Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) prevalence, spatial distribution and associated factors were assessed in four locations in Iguazú department in 2014 and in Puerto Iguazú city again in 2018. The city areas were divided into a grid of 400x400m cells. All cells were sampled in 2014 and a random subsampling was developed in 2018. In each cell, five dogs clustered in a 'critical scenario' (prone to have vectors) were sampled. A rapid immunochromatographic dipstick was used to detect antibodies against Leishmania infantum, confirming by lymph node smears observation and PCR. For Puerto Iguazú, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were constructed considering environmental, dog and clinical variables. Pearson's Chi square and Fisher's exact tests were employed to evaluate the association between CVL, dog clinical signs and infestation with other parasites. Cartographic outputs were made and Moran's I indices were calculated as spatial autocorrelation indicators. CVL prevalence rates were 26.18% in 2014 and 17.50% in 2018. No associations were established in environmental models, but dog age and repellent use were significant when running 2014 dog models. Clinical models showed significant associations between seropositive dogs and ophthalmological, dermal signs and onychogryphosis in 2014. In 2018, only adenomegaly was associated. The results of global Moran´s I were not significant but regarding local analysis, six sites in 2014 and one in 2018 presented autocorrelation with neighboring sites. The decrease in CVL prevalence may be associated to transmission stabilization, which could explain the lack of associations with dog-related variables. Further, spatial distribution of CVL is a poor evidence for design of transmission control measures but could be important in case of intensive parasite circulation or when the first autochthonous cases appear. For control success, sensitivity of diagnostic methods, political will and adequate material resources remain critical. Modeling of multiple variables will be required to identify factors that drive disease stabilization/destabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2955764041,"Objective Asphyxia of newborns is a severe and frequent challenge of the peri- and postnatal period. The purpose of this study was to study early morphological, immunological and structural alterations in lung tissue after asphyxia and hemorrhage (AH). Methods 44 neonatal piglets (age 32 hrs) underwent asphyxia and hemorrhage (AH) and were treated according to the international liaison committee of resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines. For this study, 15 piglets (blood transfusion (RBC) n = 9; NaCl n = 6, mean age 31 hrs) were randomly picked. 4 hours after ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation), lung tissue and blood samples were collected. Results An elevation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was observed 4 hrs after AH accompanied by an increase of surfactant D after RBC treatment. After AH tight junction proteins Claudin 18 and junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1) were down-regulated, whereas Occludin was increased. Furthermore, after AH and RBC treatment dephosphorylated active form of Connexin 43 was increased. Conclusions AH in neonatal pigs is associated with early lung injury, inflammation and alterations of tight junctions (Claudin, Occludin, JAM-1) and gap junctions (Connexin 43) in lung tissue, which contributes to the development of lung edema and impaired function."
https://openalex.org/W2956157813,"Autoimmunity associated with autoantibodies against the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AAB) is increasingly accepted as the driver of human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Unfortunately, there is a lack of animal models to extend the knowledge about β1-AAB autoimmunity in DCM and to develop appropriate treatment strategies.To introduce an animal model, we investigated the β1-AAB associated autoimmunity in Doberman Pinscher (DP) with dilated cardiomyopathy, which has similarities to human DCM.Eighty-seven DP with cardiomyopathy in terms of pathological ECG and echocardiography (DoCM) and 31 dogs (at enrollment) without DoCM (controls) were analyzed for serum activity of β1-AAB with a bioassay that records the chronotropic response of spontaneously beating cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to the DP's IgG. To locate the receptor binding site of β1-AAB and the autoantibody's sensitivity to inhibition, competing experiments with related blockers were performed with the bioassay. In controls that developed DoCM during follow-up, β1-AAB were analyzed during progress.Fifty-nine (67.8%) DoCM dogs and 19 (61.3%) controls were β1-AAB positive. Of the controls that developed DoCM, 8 were β1-AAB positive (p = 0.044 vs. dogs remaining in the control group); their β1-AAB activity increased with the cardiomyopathy progress (p<0.02). To supplement DoCM group with the 9 animals which developed cardiomyopathy in the follow up, a more pronounced β1-AAB positivity became visible in the DoCM group (p = 0.066). Total and cardiac mortality were higher in β1-AAB positive DP (p = 0.002; p = 0037). The dogs' β1-AAB recognized a specific epitope on the second extracellular receptor and were sensitive to inhibition by drugs already successfully tested to inhibit the corresponding human autoantibody.Doberman Pinschers presented β1-AAB associated autoimmunity, similar as in the pathogenesis of human DCM. Consequently, DP could compensate the lack of animal models for the investigation of β1-AAB autoimmunity in human DCM."
https://openalex.org/W2955637253,"This work reveals a set of surface topography parameters that are significant for algal attachment to natural rock substrata. Topography analysis of rock surfaces from a stream identifies three descriptive areal parameters (Smr, Sv, and Sa) that correlate with the presence of natural periphyton community. A method was developed and validated to reverse engineer and manufacture artificial substrata with topographic complexity defined by these parameters, using computational modeling and additive manufacturing. Results from colonization experiments with filamentous algae show statistically significant increases in early biomass accrual rates on substrata with higher values of Sa and Sv parameters and lower values of Smr parameter. These results suggest that manipulation of the level of roughness (peak-to-valley distance and material ratio above the mean) and the distribution of hill and dale sequences can control initial colonization locations and biomass accrual rates, presumably by enhancing growth and recruitment of cells from the overlying flow into protected refugia spaces. As such, these findings provide an approach for optimizing the design of substratum for increased early biomass productivity for attached growth algae cultivation systems."
https://openalex.org/W2955754214,"Background Recently we proposed a new method called generalized Poincaré plot (gPp) analysis which gave a new insight into the pattern of neurocaridac control. In this study we examined potential of gPp method to reveal changes in cardiac neural control in young athletes during three conditions: supine rest, running and relaxation, with respect to untrained subjects. Methods This method is based on the quantification of Pearson’s correlation coefficients r(j, k), between symmetrical (j = k) and asymmetrical summed j previous and k following RR intervals up to the 100th order (j,k≤100). Results Differences between groups were obtained at all levels of this analysis. The main result is the significant difference of NAI, normalized index of asymmetry, between groups in running, which was originated in different positions of local maxima of r(j, k). Compared with untrained subjects, these findings indicate modified neural control and altered intrinsic heart rate behavior in athletes which are related to some kind of memory mechanism between RR intervals. Conclusion Obtained results provide great potential of gPp method analysis in the recognition of changes in neurocardiac control in healthy subjects. Further studies are needed for identification of altered cardiac regulatory mechanisms whose background may be useful in the evaluation of genesis of athletes neurocardiovascular pathology."

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a technique that can non-invasively quantify deep tissue microvascular blood flow. We tested the hypothesis that CEUS of forearm skeletal muscle could be used to: 1) assess microvascular abnormalities that occur during vaso-occlusive crisis; and 2) test new therapies for SCD that are targeted to improving the status of the microcirculation. We performed a prospective study, CEUS perfusion imaging of resting forearm muscle was performed in adults with SCD: 1) during and after a pain episode, and 2) before, during, and after a 24-hour infusion of the investigative agent, regadenoson, an adenosine A2A agonist. CEUS destruction-replenishment time-intensity data were analyzed to measure microvascular blood flow, as well as its components, microvascular blood volume and flux rate. Serial CEUS measurements were obtained in 32 adults with SCD. For the studies during crisis, there was a 30% reduction in microvascular blood flow compared to steady-state (p = 0.031), a reduction that was largely due to microvascular flux rate. For the regadenoson group, a non-significant 25% increase in flux rate and 9% increase in microvascular blood flow compared to baseline were detected during infusion. In a study of adults with SCD, CEUS detected changes in microvascular blood flow associated with vaso-occlusive crises. No changes were found during an infusion of the adenosine A2A agonist, regadenoson. This study provides preliminary evidence that CEUS could detect blood flow changes consistent with SCD physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2956034420,"Objective Meningitis after microsurgery for vestibular schwannoma (VS) is a severe complication that results in high morbidity. However, few studies have focused on meningitis after VS surgery. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for meningitis after VS surgery. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of all VS patients who underwent microsurgery and survived for at least 7 days after surgery, between 1 June 2015 and 30 November 2018 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for postoperative meningitis (POM). Results We enrolled 410 patients, 27 of whom had POM. Through univariate analysis, the factors of hydrocephalus (p = 0.018), Koos grade IV (p = 0.04), operative duration > 3 hours (p = 0.03) and intraoperative bleeding volume ≥400 ml (p = 0. 02) were significantly correlated with POM. The multivariate analysis showed that Koos grade IV (p = 0.04; OR = 3.19; 95% CI 1.032–3.190), operation duration > 3 hours (p = 0.03; OR = 7.927; 95% CI 1.043–60.265), and intraoperative bleeding volume ≥ 400 ml (p = 0.02; OR = 2.551; 95% CI 1.112–5.850) were the independent influencing factors of POM. Conclusions Koos grade IV, operation duration > 3 hours, and intraoperative blood loss ≥ 400 ml were identified as independent risk factors for POM after microsurgery for VS. POM also caused a prolonged hospital stay."
https://openalex.org/W2955883006,"Nitrate can be reduced to other N inorganic species via denitrification and incorporated into organic matter by immobilization; however, the effect of biotic/abiotic and redox condition on immobilization and denitrification processes from a single system are not well documented. We hypothesize nitrate (NO3-) transformation pathways leading to the formation of dissolved- and solid-phase organic N are predominantly controlled by abiotic reactions, but the formation of soluble inorganic N species is controlled by redox condition. In this study, organic matter in the form of leaf compost (LC) was spiked with 15NO3- and incubated under oxic/anoxic and biotic/abiotic conditions at pH 6.5. We seek to understand how variations in environmental conditions impact NO3- transformation pathways through laboratory incubations. We find production of NH4+ is predominantly controlled by redox whereas NO3- conversion to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and immobilization in solid-phase N are predominantly controlled by abiotic processes. Twenty % of added 15N-NO3- was incorporated into DON under oxic conditions, with abiotic processes accounting for 85% of the overall incorporation. Nitrogen immobilization processes resulted in N concentrations of 4.1–6.6 μg N (g leaf compost)-1, with abiotic processes accounting for 100% and 66% of the overall (biotic+abiotic) N immobilization under anoxic and oxic conditions, respectively. 15N-NMR spectroscopy suggests 15NO3- was immobilized into amide/aminoquinones and nitro/oxime under anoxic conditions. A fraction of the NH4+ was produced abiotically under anoxic conditions (~10% of the total NH4+ production) although biotic organic N mineralization contributed to most of NH4+ production. Our results also indicate Fe(II) did not act as an electron source in biotic-oxic incubations; however, Fe(II) provided electrons for NO3- reduction in biotic-anoxic incubations although it was not the sole electron source. It is clear that, under the experimental conditions of this investigation, abiotic and redox processes play important roles in NO3- transformations. As climatic conditions change (e.g., frequency/intensity of rainfall), abiotic reactions that shift transformation pathways and N species concentrations from those controlled by biota might become more prevalent."

PA coils with a high number of channels may offer parallel imaging (PI) with a high reduction (R)-factor, which is enabled via under-sampling and coil geometry (g) factor, increasing the radiofrequency signal sensitivity provided by a small coil. The goals of this study were to assess and validate the coil performance of PA coils with different numbers of receiver (Rx)-channels in and to propose the coil selection guidelines by visualizing 7T brain images. The combined magnetic flux density (||B1||) distributions of four configurations of PA coils-4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-channel Rx-only mode under the local transmit (Tx) mode of birdcage coils-were evaluated using electromagnetic (EM) calculations. These four configurations of PA coils and a local Tx coil were designed and built for a 7T MRI experiment. For 7T brain imaging experiments, all PA coils with (w/) and without (w/o) R-factors were compared in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial noise variation (SNV). EM simulation results clearly demonstrated that PA coils with a high number of Rx channels showed more homogeneously distributed ||B1|| fields than a PA coils with a low number of Rx coils. The results of this study demonstrate that a collection of smaller surface coils can contribute to high RF signal sensitivity in terms of the anatomical coverage of the brain and may facilitate PI. With further improvement in coil technology, researchers and clinicians will be provided with PA coils with different numbers of channels, which can ensure the optimum SNR and PI benefits for 7T brain MR imaging."

To our knowledge, we are the first to employ the use of air conditioning to examine whether and how weather, especially excessively high temperature, and other factors affect stock returns. Using data for 1885-1914, we show that lower Dow Jones Average (DJA) returns were significantly associated with hotness before the NYSE trading rooms were equipped with the cooling system in 1903, whereas this correlation is largely weakened afterward. We also find that before the introduction of the air-cooling system, the negative effect of high temperatures on stock returns was stronger when the precipitation was lower. We obtain consistent results when controlling for the calendar anomalies such as the May-to-October effect, the Monday effect, and the effect of macroeconomic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2955124103,"In reverse genetic experiments we have isolated recombinant mumps viruses (rMuV) that carry large numbers of mutations clustered in small parts of their genome, which are not caused by biased hyper-mutation. In two separate experiments we obtained such recombinant viruses: one virus had 11 mutations in the V/P region of the genome; the other, which also contained an extra transcription unit encoding green fluorescent protein (EGFP), had 32 mutations in the N gene. These specific sets of mutations have not been observed in naturally occurring MuV isolates. Unusually, the vast majority of the mutations (48/51) were synonymous. On passage in Vero cells and human B-LCL cells, a B lymphocyte-like cell line, these mutations appear stable as no reversion occurred to the original consensus sequence, although mutations in other parts of the genome occurred and changed in frequency during passage. Defective interfering RNAs accumulate in passage in Vero cells but not in B-LCL cells. Interestingly, in all passaged samples the level of variation in the EGFP gene is the same as in the viral genes, though it is unlikely that this gene is under any functionality constraint. What mechanism gave rise to these viruses with clustered mutations and their stability remains an open question, which is likely of interest to a wider field than mumps reverse genetics."

Individuals were divided into four weight-change-pattern categories based on changes in their body mass index at two time points that were 7 years apart, between late adolescence (aged 18-19 years) and young adulthood (aged 25-26 years). These categories were (1) no obesity, (2) obesity reversal, (3) developing obesity, and (4) persistent obesity. Cross-classified, hierarchical linear regression modeling analysis was performed to explore the association of weight change patterns with monthly wage in young adulthood, after adjustment for both individual- and contextual-level variables.Of the weight-change-pattern categories for both genders, individuals with persistent obesity had the lowest monthly wage. For women, the mean monthly wage decreased progressively for the categories of no obesity, obesity reversal, developing obesity, and persistent obesity (test for difference, P = 0.016; test for trend, P = 0.026). Women with persistent obesity earned 20% less per month than did those who were never obese (P = 0.024), after controlling for individual and contextual factors. For men, no association was found between weight change patterns and monthly wage.Persistent obesity from late adolescence to young adulthood is associated with low monthly wage in young adulthood in women but not in men. These findings highlight the urgency of addressing persistent obesity early in life, especially for women."
https://openalex.org/W2955990866,"Direct cardiac compression (DCC) holds enormous potential as a safe and effective means to treat heart failure patients who require long-term, or even permanent, biventricular support. However, devices developed to date are not tuned to meet the individual compression requirements of the left and right ventricles, which can differ substantially. In this paper, a systematic study examining the relationship, range, and effect of independent pressures on the left and right epicardial surfaces of a passive human heart model was performed as a means to optimize cardiac output via DCC support. Hemodynamic and tissue deformation effects produced by varying epicardial compressions were examined using finite element analysis. Results indicate that 1) designing a direct cardiac compression pump that applies separate pressures to the left and right ventricles is critical to maintain equivalent stroke volume for both ventricles, and 2) left and right ventricular epicardial pressures of 340 mmHg and 44 mmHg, respectively, are required to induce normal ejection fractions in a passive heart. This pilot study provides fundamental insights and guidance towards the design of improved direct cardiac compression devices for long-term circulatory support."
https://openalex.org/W2953558635,"Despite having been sequenced over a decade ago, the functional significance of much of the mammalian genome remains unknown. The mouse has become the preeminent mammalian model for identifying endogenous gene function in vivo. Here we characterize the phenotype of a loss-of function allele for the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, Elongation Factor Homolog 1 (Elof1). Recent work utilizing the yeast homolog, Elf1, has demonstrated that Elf1 associates with the RNA polymerase II complex to promote elongation by relieving the association of the template DNA strand with bound histones. Loss of Elof1 results in developmental delay and morphological defects during early mouse development resulting in peri-gastrulation lethality. Although Elof1 is highly conserved we observe tissue specific expression during gastrulation and in adult murine tissues, suggesting there may be other genes with similar function in diverse tissues or that mElof1 has adopted lineage specific functions. To better understand its function in mammalian transcription, we examined splice variants and find that Elof1 regulates mutually exclusive exon use in vivo. Distinct from what has been demonstrated in yeast, we demonstrate that Elof1 is essential for viability during mammalian gastrulation which may be due to a role mediating tissue specific exclusive exon use, a regulatory function unique to higher eukaryotes."

Design Using nationally representative repeated cross-sectional surveys in Japan, the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions and National Health and Nutrition Survey, with plasma biomarkers as instrumental variables for quasi-randomization. Setting Onset of cardiovascular diseases in those receiving regular treatment for hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, intracerebral infarction, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or other types of cardiovascular diseases. Participants A total of 65,615 persons aged ≥ 20 years (35,037 women and 30,578 men) who completed a survey conducted every three years from 1995 through 2013. Main outcome measures Respondent employment and weekly working hours during each survey year. Results Cardiovascular diseases significantly and remarkably reduced the probability of working by 15.4% (95% CI: -30.6% to -0.2%). The reduction in working probability was detected for women only. Respondents aged ≥ 40 years were less likely to work once diagnosed and the reduction was enlarged for those aged ≥ 65 years, while those aged < 40 years appeared to be unaffected. Probability of engaging in manual labor significantly decreased once diagnosed; however, no impact was found for cognitive occupations. Among employed respondents, the adverse effects of cardiovascular diseases decreased working hours by five hours per week. Validity of the biomarker instrumental variables was generally verified. Conclusions A vicious circle is suggested between LFP and unfavorable health. However, the effects vary across age, sex, and occupation type, even after adjusting for causal effects, which could cause a downward bias in LFP impact.

https://openalex.org/W2955600584,"In order to obtain the information of the vehicle tags in adverse traffic conditions, we proposed a novel reservation framework named reservation to cancel idle-dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (RTCI-DFSA) algorithm. Firstly, the framework employed reservation mechanism to remove idle slot, and thus improve the system identification efficiency. Secondly, the vehicle information was identified by the tag serialization polling identification method. The experimental results showed that the proposed RTCI-DFSA algorithm performed better than the traditional frame slotted ALOHA (FSA) and dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (DFSA) algorithms. More specifically, the tag loss rate of the proposed framework is significantly lower than the frame length fixed and conventional dynamic vehicle identification algorithms. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated that the throughput rate of the proposed algorithm increased from 0.368 to 0.6. Besides, the identification efficiency and applicability of the proposed framework were both higher than other tag identification algorithms."
