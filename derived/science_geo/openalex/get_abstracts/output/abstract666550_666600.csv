https://openalex.org/W3119411150,"Taming a pandemic One year after its emergence, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become so widespread that there is little hope of elimination. There are, however, several other human coronaviruses that are endemic and cause multiple reinfections that engender sufficient immunity to protect against severe adult disease. By making assumptions about acquired immunity from its already endemic relatives, Lavine et al. developed a model with which to analyze the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 into endemicity. The model accounts for SARS-CoV-2's age-structured disease profile and assesses the impact of vaccination. The transition from epidemic to endemic dynamics is associated with a shift in the age distribution of primary infections to younger age groups, which in turn depends on how fast the virus spreads. Longer-lasting sterilizing immunity will slow the transition to endemicity. Depending on the type of immune response it engenders, a vaccine could accelerate establishment of a state of mild disease endemicity. Science , this issue p. 741"

The global pandemic caused by the latest such virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need to protect against other strains that could present a threat to humans. Cohen et al. constructed nanoparticles displaying the protein domain that binds the host cell receptor (receptor-binding domain or RBD), either a homotypic SARS-CoV-2 particle or mosaic particles displaying RBDs from four or eight different betacoronaviruses. In mice, antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were elicited just as well by mosaic particles as by homotypic nanoparticles. The mosaic nanoparticles elicited antibodies that, beyond recognizing the strains displayed, also recognized mismatched strains. Science , this issue p. 735"

However, these large proteins are difficult to produce in the needed quantities and at low cost. Attention has turned to nanobodies, which are aptly named, single-domain antibodies that are easier to produce and have the potential to be administered by inhalation. Koenig et al. describe four nanobodies that bind to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and prevent infection of cells (see the Perspective by Saelens and Schepens). Structures show that the nanobodies target two distinct epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Multivalent nanobodies neutralize virus much more potently than single nanobodies, and multivalent nanobodies that bind two epitopes prevent the emergence of viral escape mutants.

https://openalex.org/W3120816783,"Despite considerable efforts, the mechanisms linking genomic alterations to the transcriptional identity of cancer cells remain elusive. Integrative genomic analysis, using a network-based approach, identified 407 master regulator (MR) proteins responsible for canalizing the genetics of individual samples from 20 cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into 112 transcriptionally distinct tumor subtypes. MR proteins could be further organized into 24 pan-cancer, master regulator block modules (MRBs), each regulating key cancer hallmarks and predictive of patient outcome in multiple cohorts. Of all somatic alterations detected in each individual sample, >50% were predicted to induce aberrant MR activity, yielding insight into mechanisms linking tumor genetics and transcriptional identity and establishing non-oncogene dependencies. Genetic and pharmacological validation assays confirmed the predicted effect of upstream mutations and MR activity on downstream cellular identity and phenotype. Thus, co-analysis of mutational and gene expression profiles identified elusive subtypes and provided testable hypothesis for mechanisms mediating the effect of genetic alterations."

https://openalex.org/W3118943433,"Humans often traverse real-world environments with a variety of surface irregularities and inconsistencies, which can disrupt steady gait and require additional effort. Such effects have, however, scarcely been demonstrated quantitatively, because few laboratory biomechanical measures apply outdoors. Walking can nevertheless be quantified by other means. In particular, the foot’s trajectory in space can be reconstructed from foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs), to yield measures of stride and associated variabilities. But it remains unknown whether such measures are related to metabolic energy expenditure. We therefore quantified the effect of five different outdoor terrains on foot motion (from IMUs) and net metabolic rate (from oxygen consumption) in healthy adults (N = 10; walking at 1.25 m/s). Energy expenditure increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) in the order Sidewalk, Dirt, Gravel, Grass, and Woodchips, with Woodchips about 27% costlier than Sidewalk. Terrain type also affected measures, particularly stride variability and virtual foot clearance (swing foot’s lowest height above consecutive footfalls). In combination, such measures can also roughly predict metabolic cost (adjusted R 2 = 0.52, partial least squares regression), and even discriminate between terrain types (10% reclassification error). Body-worn sensors can characterize how uneven terrain affects gait, gait variability, and metabolic cost in the real world."
https://openalex.org/W3119243998,"Understanding how fate specification of distinct cell-types from multipotent progenitors occurs is a fundamental question in embryology. Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) generate extraordinarily diverse derivatives, including multiple neural, skeletogenic and pigment cell fates. Key transcription factors and extracellular signals specifying NCSC lineages remain to be identified, and we have only a little idea of how and when they function together to control fate. Zebrafish have three neural crest-derived pigment cell types, black melanocytes, light-reflecting iridophores and yellow xanthophores, which offer a powerful model for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of fate segregation. Mitfa has been identified as the master regulator of melanocyte fate. Here, we show that an Mitf-related transcription factor, Tfec, functions as master regulator of the iridophore fate. Surprisingly, our phenotypic analysis of tfec mutants demonstrates that Tfec also functions in the initial specification of all three pigment cell-types, although the melanocyte and xanthophore lineages recover later. We show that Mitfa represses tfec expression, revealing a likely mechanism contributing to the decision between melanocyte and iridophore fate. Our data are consistent with the long-standing proposal of a tripotent progenitor restricted to pigment cell fates. Moreover, we investigate activation, maintenance and function of tfec in multipotent NCSCs, demonstrating for the first time its role in the gene regulatory network forming and maintaining early neural crest cells. In summary, we build on our previous work to characterise the gene regulatory network governing iridophore development, establishing Tfec as the master regulator driving iridophore specification from multipotent progenitors, while shedding light on possible cellular mechanisms of progressive fate restriction."
https://openalex.org/W3118985292,"The current study describes ethnobotanical (EB) and traditional ethnomedicinal (TEMs) uses of medicinal plants (MPs) of Tehsil Samahni area of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Indigenous inhabitants of the area mostly reside in remote mountainous areas and depend on wild plants for life necessities and treatment of different diseases. This paper presents first quantitative ethnobotanical study describing the popularity level of MPs in indigenous communities by using relative popularity level (RPL) and rank order of priority (ROP) indices. The data of TEMs and EB uses were collected from 200 interviewees consisting of traditional herbal practioners (110) and farmers (90) from study area using structured and semi-structured interview methodology during year 2019. It was found that illiterate peasants have more knowledge and practice of TEMs than other people. A total of 150 plant species belonging to 58 families with botanical and local names, parts used, mode of recipes preparation, administration mechanism and TEMs uses were documented in systematic manner. It was explored that highest number (7.69%) of plants of Moraceae were used in TEMs and followed by species of Asteraceae (6.29%). The ethnobotanical data was analyzed by using quantitative ethnobotanical tools viz : informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative frequency of citation (RFC), use value index (UVI), relative importance of plants (RIP), relative populatiry level (RPL) and rank order of popularity (ROP). The leaf ranked first (36.49%) and fruit 2 nd (12.07%) being used in TEMs while prevalent use-form was decoction (29.28%), followed by tea (23.05%) and preferably taken as oral (46.66%). ICF analysis proved that diabetes, hypertension, rabies, snake sting and joint pains were the most prevalent occurring infirmities. The highest RFC (0.95) was found for Acacia modesta , followed by Boerhavia procumbens (RFC:0.87) and Berberis lycium (RFC:0.85). The relative importance of MPs was calculated by using UVI and Moringa oleifera showed highest (1.38), followed by Zanthoxylum armatum (1.25) and Withania somnifera (1.24) use-values. High UVI of plants depicts that these species are predominantly used in local health care system. The plants Phyllanthus emblica , Morus macruora , Justicia adhatoda and Melia azedarach depicted high values (1.00) of FL and RPL proving that these taxa are commonly used in indigenous medicines by local inhabitants and have better potential for drug discovery by ethnopharmacological analysis. Out of total, 26 species had more than 50% ROP index and Phyllanthus emblica and Flacourtia indica (ROP = 100) followed by Morus macruora (ROP: 97) were used to cure ‘hypertension and hyperlipidemia’ and ‘cough, chest infection’, respectively. It was found that 30% of total species were previously reported as medicinal while 70% plants were first time reported to be used in TEMs and authenticated by using of quantitative ethnobotanical tools. Ethnopharmacological potential of indigenous plants was confirmed by RIP and RPL indices which had been used to cure one or more body systems and were promulgated in the local herbal medicine system. The research provides clues to screen these plant species by using latest phytochemical and pharmacological analysis for novel drug discovery. This study will also be useful for conservation of bioculture traditional knowledge of indigenous communities and the most important is to conserve medicinal plants of the study area for future generations."
https://openalex.org/W3118789549,"Introduction Little is known about the early stage balance changes in PD. Many clinicians assume that there are no postural issues in early PD because of failure to identify them on bedside and clinical testing. Here, we quantify balance changes in early and moderate stage PD and compared these values to healthy controls (HC) using clinical assessments of balance and posturography. Methods We compared 15 HC with 15 early PD (PD-II; Hoehn and Yahr stage II) and 15 moderate PD (PD-III; H&amp;Y stage III). Participants performed various clinical tests of balance and a standing postural task on a force platform. We quantified the spatiotemporal parameters of the center of pressure (COP), the sample entropy and power spectral density (PSD) of the COP. Results The PSD of the COP differentiated PD-II from HC from 0–0.5 Hz and PD-II from PD-III from 0.5–1 Hz. Specifically, PD-II and PD-III manifested greater power than HC from 0–0.5 Hz, whereas PD-III exhibited greater power than PD-II and HC from 0.5–1.0 Hz (p&lt;0.05). However, there were no significant differences between PD-II and HC in all clinical tests and in spatiotemporal parameters of the COP (p&gt;0.05). Although the sample entropy was significantly lower in the PD groups (p&lt;0.05), entropy failed to differentiate PD-II from PD-III. Conclusion The low-frequency modulation of the COP in this small cohort differentiated early PD from HC and from moderate PD. Clinicians should be aware that there are early balance deficits in PD. A larger sample size is needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3119703758,"Previous research conducted on the cross-cultural perception of music and its emotional content has established that emotions can be communicated across cultures at least on a rudimentary level. Here, we report a cross-cultural study with participants originating from two tribes in northwest Pakistan (Khow and Kalash) and the United Kingdom, with both groups being naïve to the music of the other respective culture. We explored how participants assessed emotional connotations of various Western and non-Western harmonisation styles, and whether cultural familiarity with a harmonic idiom such as major and minor mode would consistently relate to emotion communication. The results indicate that Western concepts of harmony are not relevant for participants unexposed to Western music when other emotional cues (tempo, pitch height, articulation, timbre) are kept relatively constant. At the same time, harmonic style alone has the ability to colour the emotional expression in music if it taps the appropriate cultural connotations. The preference for one harmonisation style over another, including the major-happy/minor-sad distinction, is influenced by culture. Finally, our findings suggest that although differences emerge across different harmonisation styles, acoustic roughness influences the expression of emotion in similar ways across cultures; preference for consonance however seems to be dependent on cultural familiarity."
https://openalex.org/W3103396319,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative dementia associated with deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, formed by amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and phosphor-tau, respectively, in the central nervous system. Approximately 2% of AD cases are due to familial AD (FAD); ∼98% of cases are sporadic AD (SAD). Animal models with FAD are commonly used to study SAD pathogenesis. Because mechanisms leading to FAD and SAD may be distinct, to study SAD pathogenesis, we generated Trem2R47H knock-in rats, which carry the SAD risk factor p.R47H variant of the microglia gene triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). Trem2R47H rats produce human-Aβ from a humanized-App rat allele because human-Aβ is more toxic than rodent-Aβ and the pathogenic role of the p.R47H TREM2 variant has been linked to human-Aβ–clearing deficits. Using periadolescent Trem2R47H rats, we previously demonstrated that supraphysiological tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) boosts glutamatergic transmission, which is excitatory, and suppresses long-term potentiation, a surrogate of learning and memory. Here, we tested the effect of the p.R47H variant on the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid. We report that GABAergic transmission is decreased in Trem2R47H/R47H rats. This decrease is due to acute and reversible action of TNF-α and is not associated with increased human-Aβ levels and AD pathology. Thus, the p.R47H variant changes the excitatory/inhibitory balance, favoring excitation. This imbalance could potentiate glutamate excitotoxicity and contribute to neuronal dysfunction, enhanced neuronal death, and neurodegeneration. Future studies will determine whether this imbalance represents an early, Aβ-independent pathway leading to dementia and may reveal the AD-modifying therapeutic potential of TNF-α inhibition in the central nervous system. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative dementia associated with deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, formed by amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and phosphor-tau, respectively, in the central nervous system.

Future studies will determine whether this imbalance represents an early, Aβ-independent pathway leading to dementia and may reveal the AD-modifying therapeutic potential of TNF-α inhibition in the central nervous system. Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) represents ∼95% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. Yet, the most commonly used animal models are with familial AD (FAD) mutations, which only represent ∼5% of AD cases. This may be an issue because if FAD and SAD present significant pathogenic differences, therapeutic strategies effective in animals with FAD may have limited therapeutic efficacy in patients with SAD. Thus, model organisms that reproduce the pathogenesis of SAD would be helpful to identify therapeutic targets and test SAD-modifying therapeutics. The p.R47H variant of the microglia gene triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) triples the risk of SAD in heterozygous carriers (1Guerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J. Carrasquillo M. Rogaeva E. Majounie E. Cruchaga C. Sassi C. Kauwe J.S. Younkin S. Hazrati L. Collinge J. Pocock J. Lashley T. Williams J. et al.Alzheimer Genetic Analysis, G.TREM2 variants in Alzheimer's disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Like other SAD-associated TREM2 variants, the p.R47H variant impairs the amyloid β (Aβ)-clearing activities of microglia, presumably hampering elimination of toxic Aβ peptide forms (2Zhou Y. Ulland T.K. Colonna M. TREM2-Dependent effects on microglia in Alzheimer's disease.Front. Aging Neurosci. 2018; 10: 202Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Zhou S.L. Tan C.C. Hou X.H.

To study mechanisms by which this variant promotes SAD, we generated Trem2R47H knock-in (KI) rats. These rats carry the R47H mutation in the rat Trem2 gene and exhibit normal Trem2 splicing and expression (4Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L.

Trem2 is processed by A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10; this cleavage releases a soluble N-terminal ectodomain (5Wunderlich P. Glebov K. Kemmerling N. Tien N.T. Neumann H. Walter J.

Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 243ra286Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Levels of soluble N-terminal ectodomain were not changed in the brains of young Trem2w/w, Trem2R47H/w, and Trem2R47H/R47H rats (4Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L. Trem2 splicing and expression are preserved in a human Abeta-producing, rat knock-in model of Trem2-R47H Alzheimer's risk variant.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Trem2R47H KI rats express two humanized App rat alleles that drive production of human Aβ (4Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L. Trem2 splicing and expression are preserved in a human Abeta-producing, rat knock-in model of Trem2-R47H Alzheimer's risk variant.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Hence, this KI model is useful to study both human Aβ–dependent and human Aβ–independent effects of the R47H mutation. In summary, Trem2R47H KI rats represent a genetically faithful model organism of SAD. Pathogenic mechanisms leading to SAD may start early in life. To reveal early dysfunctions that may lead, over time, to neurodegeneration, we have studied young Trem2R47H KI rats. Preadolescent (4 weeks old) and periadolescent (6- to 8-weeks old) Trem2R47H rats showed no alteration in steady-state levels of central nervous system (CNS) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ peptides (4Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L.

Microglia.Elife. 2020; 9Google Scholar), suggesting that Aβ-clearance deficits caused by the p.R47H TREM2 variant may manifest with aging. Yet, young Trem2R47H rats present significant increased CNS and CSF concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which cause augmented glutamatergic transmission and suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP) (7Ren S. Yao W. Tambini M.D. Yin T. Norris K.A. D'Adamio L. Microglia.Elife. 2020; 9Google Scholar), an electrophysiological surrogate of learning and memory. Physiological levels of TNF-α produced by microglia are necessary to maintain normal surface expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors at postsynaptic termini; increased TNF-α concentrations promote rapid exocytosis of AMPA receptors in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, increasing the strength of glutamatergic synaptic responses (8Ogoshi F.

Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The alterations in glutamatergic transmission found in Trem2R47H rats are consistent with these effects of TNF-α and establish a direct link between a pathogenic variant of the microglia-specific TREM2 gene and neuronal dysfunction of glutamatergic transmission and LTP. In addition to boosting excitatory transmission, TNF-α decreases inhibitory synaptic strength by promoting endocytosis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, hence reducing surface GABA receptors (10Stellwagen D. Beattie E.C. Seo J.Y. Malenka R.C. Differential regulation of AMPA receptor and GABA receptor trafficking by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, we tested whether the p.R47H TREM2 variant may reduce GABA transmission via increased brain TNF-α levels, with the purpose of determining whether the p.R47H TREM2 variant changes the excitatory/inhibitory balance between glutamate and GABA transmission, favoring excitation. This unbalance could potentiate glutamate excitotoxicity and, over time, contribute to neuronal dysfunction, enhanced neuronal cell death, and neurodegeneration. We examined the effects of the Trem2R47H variant on GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer-collateral pathway. First, we examined paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of GABAA receptor postsynaptic current, which is inversely correlated to the presynaptic GABA release probability. Our results show that PPF with 50- and 200-ms intervals is significantly increased in Trem2R47H/R47H rats with SAD (Fig. 1, A–C), indicating GABA release is undermined in Trem2R47H/R47H rats. Second, we analyzed miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). The frequency of mIPSCs that largely reflects presynaptic GABA release probability is slightly decreased in both Trem2R47H/w and Trem2R47H/R47H rats; however, this decrease fails to achieve statistical significance (Fig. 1, D, E and H). Interestingly, the amplitude of mIPSCs that is dependent on levels of postsynaptic ionotropic GABAA receptors was significantly decreased in both Trem2R47H/w and Trem2R47H/R47H rats (Fig. 1D, F and I), suggesting a reduction of GABAA receptors on the postsynaptic surface. Moreover, we found that in Trem2R47H/R47H rats, the decay time of mIPSC is shorter than in WT rats (Fig. 1G). As the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor determines the decay time of mIPSCs (12Eyre M.D. Renzi M. Farrant M. Nusser Z. Setting the time course of inhibitory synaptic currents by mixing multiple GABA(A) receptor α subunit isoforms.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5853-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it is possible that the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor is altered in Trem2R47H/R47H rats. Altogether, these results suggest that the pathogenic variant p.R47H of the microglia gene TREM2 leads to the reduction of GABAergic transmission to CA1 pyramidal neurons, and this effect is gene-dosage dependent. TNF-α produced by glia is necessary for physiological postsynaptic surface expression of both AMPA and GABA receptors. These two opposite effects of physiological TNF-α cooperate in maintaining physiological excitatory/inhibitory balance and the excitatory synaptic strength. Increased TNF-α concentration causes a swift surface AMPA receptor expression at postsynaptic termini and endocytosis of GABA receptors in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, changing the excitatory/inhibitory balance and favoring excitation (8Ogoshi F.

Consistently, young Trem2R47H/R47H rats show increased levels of TNF-α in the brain and CSF, which leads to enhanced glutamatergic transmission (7Ren S. Yao W. Tambini M.D. Yin T. Norris K.A. D'Adamio L. Microglia.Elife. 2020; 9Google Scholar). To test whether TNF-α mediates the reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission at hippocampal SC–CA3>CA1 synapses of periadolescent rats carrying the Trem2R47H variant, we treated hippocampal slices with a neutralizing antibody to rat TNF-α (anti–TNF-α), which functions as a TNF-α antagonist. To control for off-target effects of the antibody, we used a goat immunoglobulin (Ig)G isotype control. The 50% neutralization dose of this anti–TNF-α antibody against the cytotoxic effect of recombinant rat TNF-α (0.25 ng/ml) is about 500 ng/ml. Because physiological levels of TNF-α are necessary for normal glutamatergic transmission and most of the activities of TNF-α can be rapidly reversed (8Ogoshi F. Yin H.Z. Kuppumbatti Y. Song B.

At this concentration, anti–TNF-α occluded the increased PPF (Fig. 2, A–C), the decreased mIPSC amplitude, and decay time (Fig. 2D, F, G and I) in Trem2R47H/R47H rats. The goat IgG isotype control did not restore inhibitory GABAergic transmission alterations observed in the mutant rats (Fig. 2D, F, G and I) indicating that the effects of anti–TNF-α are specific. In addition, these low doses of anti–TNF-α do not alter inhibitory transmission in Trem2w/w rats (Fig. 2, A–I), indicating that at least at this dosage, anti–TNF-α only targets GABAergic transmission alterations triggered by excess TNF-α set off by the Trem2R47H variant. Overall, these data indicate that the decrease of GABAergic transmission at SC–CA3>CA1 synapses of Trem2R47H/R47H rats is due to the acute action of supraphysiological TNF-α concentrations prompted by the Trem2R47H variant and are rapidly reversible. Analysis of brain homogenates from preadolescent rats (4Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L. Trem2 splicing and expression are preserved in a human Abeta-producing, rat knock-in model of Trem2-R47H Alzheimer's risk variant.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) showed no significant alterations in levels of human Aβ40, Aβ42, and the Aβ42-to-Aβ40 ratio in Trem2R47H rats, although the Trem2R47H variant reduces binding and clearance of human Aβ in vitro (13Zhao Y. Wu X. Li X. Jiang L.L. Gui X. Liu Y. Sun Y. Zhu B. Pina-Crespo J.C. Zhang M. Zhang N. Chen X. Bu G. An Z. Huang T.Y. et al.TREM2 is a receptor for beta-amyloid that mediates microglial function.Neuron. 2018; 97: 1023-1031.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Previously, we found no changes in Aβ levels in the CSF of periadolescent animals as compared with Trem2w/w rats (7Ren S. Yao W. Tambini M.D. Yin T. Norris K.A. D'Adamio L. Microglia.Elife. 2020; 9Google Scholar). However, CSF concentrations of Aβ may not reflect the brain Aβ levels because aggregation of Aβ peptides in brain parenchyma may influence Aβ levels in the CSF. Thus, we assessed further Aβ levels in the brains of Trem2R47H periadolescent animals, which were tested for glutamatergic (7Ren S. Yao W. Tambini M.D. Yin T. Norris K.A. D'Adamio L. Microglia.Elife. 2020; 9Google Scholar) and GABAergic transmission (Figs. 1 and 2). No differences were seen in Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 levels and the Aβ42-to-Aβ40 ratio between periadolescent Trem2w/w, Trem2R47H/w, and Trem2R47H/R47H rats (Fig. 3A), further suggesting that the reduced Aβ clearance caused by the Trem2R47H variant in vitro does not result in significant alterations of Aβ steady-state levels in vivo, at least in preadolescent and periadolescent rats. It has been postulated that toxic forms of Aβ are oligomers (14Shankar G.M. Li S. Mehta T.H. Garcia-Munoz A. Shepardson N.E. Smith I. Brett F.M. Farrell M.A. Rowan M.J. Lemere C.A. Regan C.M. Walsh D.M. Sabatini B.L. Selkoe D.J. Amyloid-beta protein dimers isolated directly from Alzheimer's brains impair synaptic plasticity and memory.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar); we tested whether toxic oligomers are augmented in periadolescent Trem2R47H/w and Trem2R47H/R47H rats as compared with Trem2w/w animals. To this end, we used the prefibrillar oligomer-specific antibody A11 to perform dot blots (15Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Common structure of soluble amyloid oligomers implies common mechanism of pathogenesis.Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar). We found no evidence supporting an increase in neurotoxic brain oligomer levels in periadolescent Trem2 mutant rats with SAD as compared with WT rats (Fig. 3B). The Aβ ELISA may not efficiently measure aggregated insoluble Aβ species. These species may trigger TNF-α release and impact neurodevelopment and/or cause overt neuropathology. To test these possibilities, we used histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to characterize brains from 3-month-old male and female Trem2w/w, Trem2R47H/w, and Trem2R47H/R47H rats (see Table 1). We tested 3-month-old rats to increase the possibility of detecting pathology that may start in preadolescent rats, which may be detectable by histology and IHC only weeks later. Regions of analysis included the frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, whole hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. No gross morphological changes were evident by H&E staining in any of the rats analyzed (Fig. 4). Qualitative inspection of NeuN staining showed no appreciable changes in the neuronal density in any of the regions analyzed. Qualitative analysis performed on the hippocampus (CA1) and the somatosensory cortex did not indicate overt neuronal loss in Trem2R47H/w and Trem2R47H/R47H rats as compared with Trem2w/w rats (Fig. 5). Despite the presence of elevated proinflammatory cytokines in the brain and CSF of Trem2R47H/R47H rats and to a lesser extent of Trem2R47H/w rats, no evidence of significant astrocytosis or microgliosis was observed (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), a evaluated by the staining intensity (Fig. 5) and cellular morphology of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1)-stained tissues (Fig. 6, A–B). Although a trend toward higher IBA-1 staining intensity was observed in the Trem2R47H/R47H rats than in Trem2w/w and Trem2R47H/w rats, this was not statistically significant. The microglia presented numerous fine processes, characteristic of the resting state, and did not present obvious intermediate or amoeboid morphologies with enlarged processes or cell bodies (Fig. 6A) in all three genotypes. Similarly, astrocytes did not present hypertrophy of soma and processes in any of the groups (Fig. 6B). Amyloid plaques, as measured by simultaneous costaining with the anti-Aβ antibodies 6E10 and 4G8, were absent in all tissues analyzed (Fig. 4). Those results are consistent with the similar Aβ40 or Aβ42 levels in Trem2w/w, Trem2R47H/w, and Trem2R47H/R47H rats as well as the absence of plaque in 3-month-old rats with humanized Aβ (16Tambini M.D. Yao W.

Facilitation of glutamate, but not GABA, release in Familial Alzheimer's APP mutant Knock-in rats with increased beta-cleavage of APP.Aging Cell. 2019; 18e13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tau phosphorylation as measured by AT8 immunostaining was absent in all the groups (Fig. 4), and a modified Bielschowsky silver staining did not reveal plaques, dystrophic neurites, or axonal pathologies in any of the tissues analyzed (Fig. 4). Overall, histological analysis of these rats shows no obvious evidence of neurodevelopmental impairments, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, or AD-like pathology at 3 months of age.Table 1Primary and amplification antibodies used for IHCTargetAntigen antibody/clone (supplier)Antigen retrievalDilutionSecondary and amplificationNeuronsNeuN,Mouse monoclonal A60 (Millipore)Citrate, pH 6.0HIER1:3000RbαM and GtαRb-HRPAmyloid beta1–16 and 17–24 beta amyloid,Mouse monoclonal 6E10, and4G8 (Biolegend)80% Formic acid1:1000RbαM and GtαRb-HRPMicrogliaIBA-1,Rabbit polyclonal (Wako)Citrate, pH 6.0HIER1:2000DkαRb-bio and SA-HRPPhospho-TauPhospho-Tau (Ser202, Thr205), mouse monoclonal AT8 (ThermoFisher)Citrate, pH 6.0HIER + 10-min PK1:1000RbαM and GtαRb-HRPAstrocytesGFAP,Rabbit polyclonal (Thermo Scientific)Citrate, pH 6.0HIER1:200DkαRb-bio and SA-HRPGFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; IHC, immunohistochemistry; HIER, heat-induced antigen retrieval; PK, proteinase K; M, mouse; Rb, rabbit; Gt, goat; Dk, donkey; bio, biotin; SA, streptavidin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase.

Proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α, are significantly increased in the brain and CSF of young Trem2R47H rats (7Ren S. Yao W. Tambini M.D. Yin T. Norris K.A. D'Adamio L.

Consistent with the evidence that (1) TNF-α produced by glia controls postsynaptic physiological expression of AMPA receptors and (2) increased concentrations of TNF-α cause rapid AMPA receptor exocytosis increasing excitatory synaptic strength (8Ogoshi F.

Malenka R.C. Synaptic scaling mediated by glial TNF-alpha.Nature. 2006; 440: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), we found that supraphysiological TNF-α concentrations boost glutamatergic transmission and suppress LTP, a surrogate of learning and memory, in periadolescent Trem2R47H rats with SAD (7Ren S. Yao W. Tambini M.D. Yin T. Norris K.A. D'Adamio L. Microglia.Elife. 2020; 9Google Scholar). TNF-α also physiologically regulates, in an opposite manner, inhibitory synaptic strength by promoting endocytosis GABA receptors, hence reducing surface GABA receptors at inhibitory synapses (10Stellwagen D. Beattie E.C. Seo J.Y. Malenka R.C. Differential regulation of AMPA receptor and GABA receptor trafficking by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3219-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In accord, we show here that young Trem2R47H rats have reduced GABA responses (Fig. 1). Low doses of a neutralizing anti–TNF-α antibody occlude these alterations (Fig. 2) indicating that supraphysiological TNF-α concentrations impair GABAergic transmission in Trem2R47H rats. This evidence also indicates that GABAergic deficits must be due to an acute and constant action of supraphysiological TNF-α. TNF-α–dependent synaptic transmission alterations occur in the absence of changes in steady-state levels of soluble Aβ (Fig. 3 and (4Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L.

Microglia.Elife. 2020; 9Google Scholar)) and obvious evidence of neurodevelopmental impairments, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, or AD-like pathology (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Overall, these data suggest that the TNF-α–dependent synaptic transmission alterations caused by the p.R47H TREM2 variant are independent of, and perhaps precede, changes in Aβ steady-state levels and brain pathology. TNF-α binds 2 receptors: TNFR1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNFR2 is mainly expressed by immune and endothelial cells (17Sedger L.M. McDermott M.F.

This study explored the prevalence of dental caries on FPMs by analyzing the oral health status of 1,423,720 children aged 6–8 years in Zhejiang Province, China. The data were extracted from the dental electronic records of the schoolchildren attending the Oral Health Promotion Project (OHPP), conducted during 2013–2017 in Zhejiang Province. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the factors affecting dental caries. Boys and girls accounted for 53.2% and 46.8% of the subjects, respectively. From 2013 to 2017, the prevalence of dental caries on FPMs increased: 2013: 20.4%; 2014: 25.3%; 2015: 24.5%; 2016: 27.0%; and 2017: 29.0%, despite the OHPP conducted. Based on multiple logistic regression model, girls had a significantly higher risk of FPM caries compared to boys (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.37–1.39, p &lt; 0.0001); compared with the caries rates in urban areas, the caries risk was significantly higher in rural areas (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.14–1.16, p &lt; 0.0001). In terms of geographic location in Zhejiang Province, the odds ratios of the caries risk of the east, south, west, and north were 1.35 (1.33–1.36), 1.3 (1.28–1.31), 0.81 (0.8–0.83), and 0.82 (0.81–0.84), respectively ( p &lt; 0.0001), by considering the central region as a reference. The caries prevalence of FPMs was high, with an increasing tendency and gender, social, cultural, and environmental factors affecting the caries prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W3120217068,"Background/Aims A recent study from the United States reported that nearly 12% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) occurred in patients without cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was the most common liver disease in these patients. We aim to evaluate the characteristics, etiologies, and outcomes of cases of non‐cirrhotic HCC in East Asia, where there is a higher prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated non-cirrhotic HCC. Methods This retrospective study consecutively enrolled de novo HCC patients managed at our institution from 2011 to 2017. The presence of cirrhosis was assessed by histology; if histology was not available, it was assessed by image study. Results 2055 patients with HCC were enrolled in this study. Among them, 529 (25.7%) were non-cirrhotic. The non-cirrhotic patients were younger (60.9 vs. 62.5 years, p = 0.006), included a greater proportion of males (78.1% vs. 71.3%, p = 0.002), and had a lower body mass index (24.3 vs. 25.3 kg/m 2 , p&lt;0.001) than the cirrhotic patients. Among the non‐cirrhotic patients, HBV was the most common liver disease (49.0%). The patients with non‐cirrhotic HCC had larger tumors (5.9 vs. 4.7 cm, p&lt;0.001), underwent liver resection at a higher rate (66.0% vs. 17.4%, p&lt;0.001), and had better overall survival than the cirrhotic HCC patients (median 5.67 vs. 2.83 years, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Nearly 26% of the HCCs occurred in patients without cirrhosis. HBV was the most common liver disease in these patients, and the survival was better in the non‐cirrhotic patients than the cirrhotic patients."

This study aimed to investigate the treatment outcomes, antibiotic use and its resistance pattern among neonatal sepsis patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. We also aimed to identify the factors affecting mortality in neonatal sepsis patients. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the pediatric wards of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur, Pakistan. All eligible neonatal sepsis patients who were registered at the study site from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 were included in the study. The data collection form included information on patient’s characteristics, antibiotic use and its sensitivity pattern, laboratory and microbiological data, and final treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes included, discharged (with treatment success), leave against medical advice (LAMA), discharged on request (DOR) and death. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to find the independent factors associated with death. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Among the total 586 patients, 398 (67.9%) were male, 328 (56%) were preterm, 415 (70.8%) were diagnosed with early onset sepsis, 299 (51%) were born with low birth weight. Most of the patients (n = 484, 82.6%) were treated with amikacin+cefotaxime at the start of treatment. Culture was positive in 52 (8.9%) patients and the most commonly identified bacteria included, Klebsiella species (n = 19, 36.5%) followed by E . coli (n = 15, 28.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8, 15.4%). The identified bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the antibiotics initiated at the start of the treatment, while resistance against piperacillin+tazobactam, imipenem, vancomycin and linezolid was very low. Just under half of the patients (n = 280, 47.8%) successfully completed the treatment (i.e., discharged with treatment success), while 123 (21%) patients died during treatment. In multivariable binary logistic regression, the factors which still remained significantly associated with neonatal death included, preterm delivery (AOR 9.59; 95% CI 4.41, 20.84), sub-optimal birth weight (AOR 5.13; 95% CI 2.19, 12.04), early onset sepsis (AOR 2.99; 95% CI 1.39, 6.41) and length of hospital stay (AOR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67, 0.88). Conclusion The mortality rate associated with sepsis was high in our study cohort. The bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the antibiotics started as the empiric therapy. Rational use of antibiotics can decrease the adverse outcomes in neonatal sepsis patients."

Here, we show that JMJD2D expression was increased in liver cancer stem-like cells (LCSCs); downregulation of JMJD2D inhibited the self-renewal of LCSCs in vitro and in vivo and inhibited the lung metastasis of LCSCs by reducing the survival and the early lung seeding of circulating LCSCs. Mechanistically, JMJD2D promoted LCSC self-renewal by enhancing the expression of CSC markers EpCAM and Sox9; JMJD2D reduced H3K9me3 levels on the promoters of EpCAM and Sox9 to enhance their transcription via interaction with β-catenin/TCF4 and Notch1 intracellular domain, respectively. Restoration of EpCAM and Sox9 expression in JMJD2D-knockdown liver cancer cells rescued the self-renewal of LCSCs.

Extensive signaling pathways (such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, Hedgehog, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and IL6/STAT3 pathways) have been reported to be involved in regulating the expression of CSC markers and promoting the self-renewal of CSCs (13Cairo S.

Recent advances in epigenomics have illuminated that epigenetic regulation contributes to the self-renewal of CSCs (17Toh T.B. Lim J.J. Chow E.K. Epigenetics in cancer stem cells.Mol. Cancer. 2017; 16: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). JMJD2D, also known as KDM4D, is a histone demethylase that belongs to JMJD2 family, which has five members (JMJD2A−2E) (18Katoh M. Katoh M. Identification and characterization of JMJD2 family genes in silico.Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 1623-1628PubMed Google Scholar). JMJD2D contains a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain that removes methyl groups from lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9), lysine 79 on histone 3 (H3K79), and lysine 26 on histone 1.4 (H1.4K26) (19Berry W.L.

In the present study, we reported that JMJD2D was upregulated in LCSCs and downregulation of JMJD2D markedly inhibited the self-renewal and proliferation of LCSCs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, JMJD2D promoted the self-renewal of LCSC through enhancement of EpCAM and Sox9 expression Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways. The JMJD2D inhibitor 5-c-8HQ could attenuate the self-renewal of LCSCs in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicate that JMJD2D may be a potential therapeutic target against LCSCs. We previously reported that JMJD2D was overexpressed in colorectal and liver cancers and promoted cancer progression (25Zhuo M. Chen W. Shang S. Guo P. Peng K. Li M. Mo P. Zhang Y. Qiu X. Li W. Yu C.

Formation of tumorsphere in CSC culture media represents the principal characteristic of CSC self-renewal. To investigate the role of JMJD2D in liver LCSCs, we enriched the LCSCs by inducing hepatoma spheroid formation from human liver cancer cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7 as well as mouse liver cancer cell line Hepa1-6 and then measured the protein and mRNA expression of JMJD2D. As shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A, both the protein and mRNA levels of JMJD2D were upregulated in LCSCs (tumorsphere) compared with non-CSCs (attached cells), suggesting that JMJD2D may promote the self-renewal of LCSCs. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down JMJD2D in HepG2 and Huh-7 using two different JMJD2D shRNAs (sh2D-1 and sh2D-2) and knocked out JMJD2D in Hepa1-6 using CRISPR-Cas9 system (2D-KO) (Fig. 1B) and then performed MTT assay to measure the cell proliferation and tumorsphere formation assay to measure the tumorsphere formation ability. Downregulation of JMJD2D significantly inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation (Fig. S1, B–D) and tumorsphere formation ability as demonstrated by reduced tumorsphere number and size (Fig. 1C), indicating that JMJD2D can promote the proliferation and tumorsphere formation of liver cancer cells. Furthermore, we employed the limiting dilution assay to determine the CSC self-renewal frequency. At 200, 400, 600, and 800 cell levels, downregulation of JMJD2D resulted in a significant decrease in tumorsphere number (Fig. 1D). Serial sphere formation assays validated that the self-renewal capacities of JMJD2D-downregulated cells were decreased as compared with control cells (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results suggest that downregulation of JMJD2D reduces the self-renewal of LCSCs in vitro. CSCs have a strong ability to form tumors (29Clevers H. The cancer stem cell: premises, promises and challenges.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). To characterize the role of JMJD2D in LCSC-derived tumor initiation and progression, in vivo limiting dilution assay was performed using LCSCs disassociated from cultured spheroids. LCSCs derived from JMJD2D-downregulated spheroids displayed a lower tumorigenicity compared with the cells from control spheroids (Fig. 2, A–B). LCSCs from JMJD2D-downregulated spheroids exhibited decreased subcutaneous graft tumor growth and tumor weight (Fig. 2, C–D). Furthermore, we performed Ki67 staining to determine the effects of JMJD2D downregulation on cell proliferation in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2, E–F, downregulation of JMJD2D dramatically reduced Ki67-positive cell number in subcutaneous graft tumors. Although subcutaneous graft tumor is the most common graft tumor model, orthotopic graft tumor model is representative of natural progression of liver cancer. Therefore, we performed orthotopic graft tumor model to determine the effect of JMJD2D downregulation on the initiation and progression of LCSC-derived tumors in vivo. We found that orthotopic graft tumors derived from JMJD2D-downregulated spheroids grew much slower than control tumors (Fig. 2, G–H). These results indicate that downregulation of JMJD2D inhibits the initiation and progression of LCSC-derived tumor in vivo. Tumor metastasis is the major cause of cancer-associated mortality. Tumor cells invade the surrounding tissue of the primary tumor, intravasate into blood to become circulating tumor cells (CTCs), translocate to distant tissues, and eventually seed, proliferate, and colonize to form metastatic tumors (30Lu W. Kang Y. Epithelial-Mesenchymal plasticity in cancer progression and metastasis.Dev. Cell. 2019; 49: 361-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). CSCs are regarded to be the source of CTCs and responsible for tumor metastasis. To evaluate the function of JMJD2D in CTCs, we injected green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled LCSCs into mouse tail vein to establish a mouse model of CTCs and then detected GFP-labeled CTCs in mouse peripheral blood by flow cytometry as well as counted the early lung seeding GFP-labeled CTCs under the fluorescence microscope at 36 h after LCSCs injection. Downregulation of JMJD2D significantly reduced the number of CTCs in mouse peripheral blood (Fig. 3, A–B) and the number of the early lung seeding CTCs (Fig. 3, C–D), suggesting that JMJD2D promotes the survival of CTCs in blood and the early seeding of CTCs in the lung. Consequently, the number of metastasizing tumors in the lungs was significantly decreased in mice injected with JMJD2D-downregulated LCSCs as compared with control cells (Fig. 3, E and F). These results suggest that downregulation of JMJD2D inhibits the lung metastasis of LCSCs by reducing the survival and the early lung seeding of circulating LCSCs. To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which JMJD2D promotes the self-renewal of LCSCs, we examined the effects of JMJD2D knockdown on the expression of several LCSCs-related CSC markers, including CD13, CD44, CD133, OCT4, Sox2, KLF4, Nanog, EpCAM, CD90, and Sox9. As shown in Fig. S2A, the mRNA levels of EpCAM and Sox9, but not other CSC markers, were significantly reduced in two JMJD2D-knockdown HepG2 cell lines. Knockdown of either EpCAM or Sox9 significantly inhibited the proliferation and tumorsphere formation ability of HepG2 cells (Fig. S2, B–C), suggesting that downregulation of EpCAM and Sox9 may, at least in part, be responsible for the inhibitory effects of JMJD2D knockdown on the self-renewal of LCSCs. To show that the inhibitory effects of JMJD2D knockdown on EpCAM and Sox9 expression is not just limited to HepG2 cells, we also measured the mRNA levels of EpCAM and Sox9 in JMJD2D-downregulated Huh-7 and Hepa1-6 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, downregulation of JMJD2D significantly decreased EpCAM and Sox9 mRNA levels in HepG2, Huh-7, and Hepa1-6 cells. Consistent with the mRNA levels, the protein levels of EpCAM and Sox9 were decreased in JMJD2D-downregulated HepG2, Huh7, and Hepa1-6 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we found that the expression of JMJD2D, EpCAM, and Sox9 was upregulated in human liver cancer specimens in GEO database (Fig. S3A), and the mRNA levels of JMJD2D were positively correlated with EpCAM and Sox9 in TCGA database (Fig. S3B). To determine whether JMJD2D regulates EpCAM and Sox9 expression at the transcriptional level, we transfected EpCAM and Sox9 promoter reporters into JMJD2D-knockdown and control cells, respectively. The results showed that knockdown of JMJD2D decreased the promoter activities of EpCAM and Sox9 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that JMJD2D regulates EpCAM and Sox9 expression at the transcriptional level. It has been reported that EpCAM is a transcriptional target gene of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway with two TCF4 binding elements (TBE) on the EpCAM promoter (TBE1 and TBE2) (31Yamashita T. Budhu A. Forgues M. Wang X.W. Activation of hepatic stem cell marker EpCAM by Wnt-beta-catenin signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and Sox9 is a transcriptional target gene of Notch signaling pathway with a NICD1 binding site on the Sox9 promoter (32Capaccione K.M. Hong X.H. Morgan K.M. Liu W.Y. Bishop M.J. Liu L.X. Markert E. Deen M. Minerowicz C. Allen T. Pine S.R. Sox9 mediates Notch1-induced mesenchymal features in lung adenocarcinoma.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 3636-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed promoter reporter assays to determine whether JMJD2D can cooperate with β-catenin/TCF4 and NICD1 to enhance the promoter activities of EpCAM and Sox9, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4D, ectopic expression of JMJD2D and β-catenin/TCF4 as well as JMJD2D and NICD1 synergistically increased the promoter activities of EpCAM and Sox9, respectively, indicating that JMJD2D cooperates with β-catenin/TCF4 and NICD1 to enhance the transcription of EpCAM and Sox9, respectively. Next, we wondered whether JMJD2D and β-catenin/TCF4 can be recruited to the endogenous EpCAM promoter, and JMJD2D and NICD1 can be recruited to the endogenous Sox9 promoter. To this end, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted. As shown in Fig. 4E, JMJD2D could be recruited to the promoters of EpCAM and Sox9, but JMJD2D knockdown reduced its recruitment as expected. As a histone demethylase, JMJD2D promotes gene transcription through demethylating H3K9me3 on the promoter. The results of ChIP assays showed that the H3K9me3 levels on the promoters of EpCAM and Sox9 were increased in JMJD2D-knockdown cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4F), suggesting that JMJD2D is responsible for demethylating H3K9me3 on the promoters of EpCAM and Sox9. The results of ChIP assays showed that β-catenin/TCF4 could be recruited to the EpCAM promoter and NICD1 could be recruited to the Sox9 promoter as expected, but their recruitment was reduced in JMJD2D-knockdown cells (Fig. 4G), indicating that H3K9me3 demethylation facilitates the recruitment of β-catenin/TCF4 and NICD1 to the promoters of EpCAM and Sox9, respectively. Collectively, these results suggest that JMJD2D demethylates H3K9me3 on the promoters of EpCAM and Sox9 and facilitates the recruitment and transactivation of TCF4/β-catenin and NICD1, respectively. To determine whether the demethylase activity of JMJD2D is required for the transcription of EpCAM and Sox9 to promote the self-renewal of LCSCs, we transfected wild-type JMJD2D and demethylase-defective JMJD2DS200M mutant plasmids into HepG2 cells, respectively. Compared with wild-type JMJD2D, JMJD2DS200M mutant failed to cooperate with β-catenin/TCF4 and NICD1 to enhance the promoter activities of EpCAM and Sox9 (Fig. S4A), failed to induce the expression of EpCAM and Sox9 in HepG2 cells (Fig. S4B), and failed to promote tumorsphere formation of LCSCs (Fig. S4C). These results suggest that the demethylase activity is required for JMJD2D to enhance EpCAM and Sox9 expression to promote the self-renewal of LCSCs. To determine whether JMJD2D could interact with β-catenin/TCF4 and NICD1 in liver cancer cells, we performed Co-IP assays. The results showed that JMJD2D interacted with β-catenin/TCF4 and NICD1 in HepG2, Huh-7, and Hepa1-6, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, GST pull-down assays showed that JMJD2D interacted with TCF4 at its HMG Box domain and C-terminal domain (Fig. 5C), and TCF4 interacted with JMJD2D at its C-terminal domain (Fig. 5D). We previously reported that the Jmjc domain of JMJD2D interacted with the ARM-3-10 domain of β-catenin (33Peng K. Kou L. Yu L. Bai C. Li M. Mo P. Li W. Yu C. Histone demethylase JMJD2D interacts with beta-catenin to induce transcription and activate colorectal cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice.Gastroenterology. 2019; 156: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, JMJD2D bound to β-catenin and TCF4 via different domains. The N-terminal domain of TCF4 could interact with the ARM-3-10 domain of β-catenin (Fig. S5, A and B). Thus, JMJD2D, β-catenin, and TCF4 interact with each other to form a ternary complex (Fig. 5E). GST pull-down assays also showed that JMJD2D interacted with NICD1 at its ANK domain (Fig. 5F), and NICD1 interacted with JMJD2D at its C-terminal domain (Fig. 5G). Collectively, these results implicate that β-catenin/TCF4 could interact with JMJD2D to recruit it to the EpCAM promoter and NICD1 could interact with JMJD2D to recruit it to the Sox9 promoter to enhance EpCAM and Sox9 expression, respectively. To further confirm that EpCAM and Sox9 mediate the promoting effect of JMJD2D on the self-renewal of LCSCs, we ectopically expressed EpCAM, Sox9, and EpCAM plus Sox9 in JMJD2D-knockdown HepG2 cells, respectively, and then measured the proliferation and tumorsphere formation abilities of cells. Restoration of EpCAM or Sox9 expression alone partially rescued the proliferation (Fig. S6, A and B) and the tumorsphere formation abilities of JMJD2D-knockdown cells (Fig. 6, A and B) Restoration of both EpCAM and Sox9 expression more efficiently rescued the proliferation (Fig. S6C) and the tumorsphere formation abilities of JMJD2D-knockdown cells (Fig. 6C). Consistently, restoration of EpCAM and Sox9 expression in JMJD2D-knockdown LCSCs partially rescued the subcutaneous tumor growth (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results support the notion that JMJD2D promotes the self-renewal of LCSCs through enhancing the expression of EpCAM and Sox9. Since JMJD2D can activate Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, apart from EpCAM and Sox9, JMJD2D may promote LCSC self-renewal by regulating the expression of other CSC-related genes such as c-Myc and Hes1 via Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, respectively (Fig. S7). Given that downregulation of JMJD2D could inhibit LCSC self-renewal, we wondered whether a JMJD2D inhibitor 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (5-c-8HQ), which reduces both demythelase activity and protein levels of JMJD2D (26Peng K. Kou L. Yu L. Bai C. Li M. Mo P. Li W. Yu C. Histone demethylase JMJD2D interacts with beta-catenin to induce transcription and activate colorectal cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice.Gastroenterology. 2018; 156: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), could inhibit the self-renewal of LCSCs. To this end, HepG2, Huh-7, and Hepa1-6 cells were treated with 5-c-8HQ (Fig. S8A), and then the self-renewal of LCSCs was measured by tumorsphere formation assay. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, 5-c-8HQ treatment for 48 h significantly reduced the protein and mRNA levels of EpCAM and Sox9 in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, 5-c-8HQ treatment markedly reduced the tumorsphere formation abilities of LCSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, 5-c-8HQ treatment significantly inhibited LCSC orthotopic graft tumor growth (Fig. 7D) and decreased Ki67-positive tumor cells (Fig. 7E). As expected, 5-c-8HQ treatment significantly reduced the protein levels of EpCAM and Sox9 in LCSC orthotopic graft tumors (Fig. 7F). Moreover, JMJD2D inhibitor 5-c-8HQ could also suppress the expression of c-Myc and Hes1 in orthotopic tumors (Fig. S8B). Treatment with 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg 5-c-8HQ did not result in obvious adverse effects on mice as demonstrated by no body weight reduction and no toxicity to the major organs after treatment (Fig. S8, C and D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that JMJD2D could be targeted by a chemical inhibitor to reduce the expression of EpCAM, Sox9, c-Myc, and Hes1 and to inhibit the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of LCSCs (Fig. 7G). In addition, transient knockdown of JMJD2D by siRNA reduced the mRNA and protein levels of EpCAM, Sox9, c-Myc, and Hes1 (Fig. S9, A and B), as well as the proliferation and tumorsphere formation of Hepa1-6 cells (Fig. S9, C and D), supporting the notion that inhibition of JMJD2D is an effective way to inhibit the self-renewal of LCSCs for liver cancer therapy. CSCs are believed to be responsible for the initiation, propagation, metastasis, chemoresistance, and heterogeneity of solid tumor (3Lobo N.A. Shimono Y. Qian D. Clarke M.F. The biology of cancer stem cells.Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 675-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Nowadays, increasing evidence shows that epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation and histone modifications participate in CSC self-renewal maintenance (34Shukla S. Meeran S.M.

https://openalex.org/W3119425531,"Background With the proposed pathophysiologic mechanism of neurologic injury by SARS CoV-2, the frequency of stroke and henceforth the related hospital admissions were expected to rise. This paper investigated this presumption by comparing the frequency of admissions of stroke cases in Bangladesh before and during the pandemic. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of stroke admissions in a 100-bed stroke unit at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital (NINS&amp;H) which is considerably a large stroke unit. All the admitted cases from 1 January to 30 June 2020 were considered. Poisson regression models were used to determine whether statistically significant changes in admission rates can be found before and after 25 March since when there is a surge in COVID-19 infections. Results A total of 1394 stroke patients took admission in the stroke unit during the study period. Half of the patients were older than 60 years, whereas only 2.6% were 30 years old or younger. The male to female ratio is 1.06:1. From January to March 2020, the mean rate of admission was 302.3 cases per month, which dropped to 162.3 cases per month from April to June, with an overall reduction of 46.3% in acute stroke admission per month. In those two periods, reductions in average admission per month for ischemic stroke (IST), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and venous stroke (VS) were 45.5%, 37.2%, 71.4% and 39.0%, respectively. Based on weekly data, results of Poisson regressions confirm that the average number of admissions per week dropped significantly during the last three months of the sample period. Further, in the first three months, a total of 22 cases of hyperacute stroke management were done, whereas, in the last three months, there was an 86.4% reduction in the number of hyperacute stroke patients getting reperfusion treatment. Only 38 patients (2.7%) were later found to be RT-PCR SARS Cov-2 positive based on nasal swab testing. Conclusion This study revealed a more than fifty percent reduction in acute stroke admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether the reduction is related to the fear of getting infected by COVID-19 from hospitalization or the overall restriction on public movement or stay-home measures remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W3119682939,"Background Face coverings constitute an important strategy for containing pandemics, such as COVID-19. Infection from airborne respiratory viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur in at least three modes; tiny and/or dried aerosols (typically &lt; 1.0 μm) generated through multiple mechanisms including talking, breathing, singing, large droplets (&gt; 0.5 μm) generated during coughing and sneezing, and macro drops transmitted via fomites. While there is a growing number of studies looking at the performance of household materials against some of these situations, to date, there has not been any systematic characterization of household materials against all three modes. Methods A three-step methodology was developed and used to characterize the performance of 21 different household materials with various material compositions (e.g. cotton, polyester, polypropylene, cellulose and blends) using submicron sodium chloride aerosols, water droplets, and mucous mimicking macro droplets over an aerosol-droplet size range of ~ 20 nm to 0.6 cm. Results Except for one thousand-thread-count cotton, most single-layered materials had filtration efficiencies &lt; 20% for sub-micron solid aerosols. However, several of these materials stopped &gt; 80% of larger droplets, even at sneeze-velocities of up to 1700 cm/s. Three or four layers of the same material, or combination materials, would be required to stop macro droplets from permeating out or into the face covering. Such materials can also be boiled for reuse. Conclusion Four layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics independent of the composition (e.g. cotton, polyester, nylon or blends) are likely to be effective source controls. One layer of tightly woven fabrics combined with multiple layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics in addition to being source controls can have sub-micron filtration efficiencies &gt; 40% and may offer some protection to the wearer. However, the pressure drop across such fabrics can be high (&gt; 100 Pa)."

The Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) was used to estimate the number of deaths that would be averted or delayed in the Costa Rican population by following the national and the international guidelines to reduce salt consumption, according to two scenarios: A) 46% reduction and B) 15% reduction, both at an energy intake of 2171 kcal. The scenarios estimated that between 4% and 13%, respectively, of deaths due to CVD would be prevented or postponed. The highest percentages of deaths prevented or postponed by type of CVD would be related to Coronary heart disease (39% and 38%, respectively), Hypertensive disease (32% and 33%, respectively), and Stroke (22% in both). The results demonstrate that reducing salt consumption could prevent or postpone an important number of deaths in Costa Rica. More support for existing policies and programs urges."
https://openalex.org/W3118920683,"Consumers are increasingly concerned about the welfare of farm animals, especially during transportation. The Canadian transport regulations state that weaned cattle require an 8 h rest after 36 h of transport. There are, however, only a few studies that assess the effect of rest on the welfare of beef cattle. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of conditioning, source and rest on indicators of welfare in 7-8-month-old beef calves during long-distance transport. Treatments consisted of a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design where the main factors were conditioning: conditioned ( C ; n = 160) or non-conditioned ( N ; n = 160); source: auction market ( A ; n = 160) or ranch direct ( R ; n = 160); and rest: 0 h ( 0 h ; n = 160) or 8 h ( 8 h ; n = 160). Means of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), serum amyloid-A, haptoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), and percentage of time standing from N calves were greater than C calves (all p ≤ 0.05). Means of percentage of time standing and CK of R calves were greater than A calves (both p ≤ 0.05). The mean of NEFA of 0 h calves was greater than the 8 h calves ( p &lt; 0.01), while the percentage of time standing of 0 h calves was less than 8 h calves ( p &lt; 0.01). Statistically significant differences between means of NEFA and standing percentage, were observed between 0 h and 8h calves. Few and inconsistent indicators of reduced welfare were observed between auction market and ranch direct calves, while non-conditioning was associated with greater physiological and behavioural indicators of reduced welfare. Based on these results, conditioning should be implemented as a management practice to improve the welfare of transported calves."
https://openalex.org/W3120793539,"Economic growth is often assumed to improve happiness for people in low income countries, although the association between monetary income and subjective well-being has been a subject of debate. We test this assumption by comparing three different measures of subjective well-being in very low-income communities with different levels of monetization. Contrary to expectations, all three measures of subjective well-being were very high in the least-monetized sites and comparable to those found among citizens of wealthy nations. The reported drivers of happiness shifted with increasing monetization: from enjoying experiential activities in contact with nature at the less monetized sites, to social and economic factors at the more monetized sites. Our results suggest that high levels of subjective well-being can be achieved with minimal monetization, challenging the perception that economic growth will raise life satisfaction among low income populations."
https://openalex.org/W3108619309,"Proper repair of damaged DNA is critical for the maintenance of genome stability. A complex composed of Integrator subunit 3 (Ints3), single-stranded DNA-binding protein 1 (SSB1), and SSB-interacting protein 1 (SSBIP1) is required for efficient homologous recombination-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent signaling pathways. It is known that in this complex the Ints3 N-terminal domain scaffolds SSB1 and SSBIP1. However, the molecular basis for the function of the Ints3 C-terminal domain remains unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Ints3 C-terminal domain, uncovering a HEAT-repeat superhelical fold. Using structure and mutation analysis, we show that the C-terminal domain exists as a stable dimer. A basic groove and a cluster of conserved residues on two opposite sides of the dimer bind single-stranded RNA/DNA (ssRNA/ssDNA) and Integrator complex subunit 6 (Ints6), respectively. Dimerization is required for nucleic acid binding, but not for Ints6 binding. Additionally, in vitro experiments using HEK 293T cells demonstrate that Ints6 interaction is critical for maintaining SSB1 protein level. Taken together, our findings establish the structural basis of a multifunctional Ints3 C-terminal module, allowing us to propose a novel mode of nucleic acid recognition by helical repeat protein and paving the way for future mechanistic studies."

Samples were taken at the end of regular classroom hours, between the dates of February 1–5 and February 19-March 4, 2020. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was isolated from the door handle on four of the 19 days sampled. Both SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were detected in a sample collected on February 21, 2020. Based on sequence analysis, the Florida SARS-CoV-2 strain (designated UF-11) was identical to strains being identified in Washington state during the same time period, while the earliest similar sequences were sampled in China/Hubei between Dec 30 th 2019 and Jan 5 th 2020. The first human case of COVID-19 was not officially reported in Florida until March 1 st . In an analysis of sequences from COVID-19 patients in this region of Florida, there was only limited evidence of subsequent dissemination of the UF-11 strain. Identical or highly similar strains, possibly related through a common transmission chain, were detected with increasing frequency in Washington state between end of February and beginning of March. Our data provide further documentation of the rapid early spread of SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the likelihood that closely related strains were cryptically circulating in multiple U.S. communities before the first “official” cases were recognized."
https://openalex.org/W3119070767,"Ambivalence, the simultaneous experience of both positive and negative feelings about one and the same attitude object, has been investigated within psychological attitude research for decades. Ambivalence is interpreted as an attitudinal conflict with distinct affective, behavioral, and cognitive consequences. In social psychological research, it has been shown that ambivalence is sometimes confused with neutrality due to the use of measures that cannot distinguish between neutrality and ambivalence. Likewise, in social robotics research the attitudes of users are often characterized as neutral. We assume that this is due to the fact that existing research regarding attitudes towards robots lacks the opportunity to measure ambivalence. In the current experiment (N = 45), we show that a neutral and a robot stimulus were evaluated equivalently when using a bipolar item, but evaluations differed greatly regarding self-reported ambivalence and arousal. This points to attitudes towards robots being in fact highly ambivalent, although they might appear neutral depending on the measurement method. To gain valid insights into people’s attitudes towards robots, positive and negative evaluations of robots should be measured separately, providing participants with measures to express evaluative conflict instead of administering bipolar items. Acknowledging the role of ambivalence in attitude research focusing on robots has the potential to deepen our understanding of users’ attitudes and their potential evaluative conflicts, and thus improve predictions of behavior from attitudes towards robots."

Active compounds endowed with a capacity to regulate the inflammatory response are regarded as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of periodontal diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the anti-inflammatory properties of a polyphenolic cinnamon fraction. Chromatographic and mass spectrometry analyses of the polyphenolic composition of the cinnamon fraction revealed that phenolic acids, flavonoids (flavonols, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols), and procyanidins make up 9.22%, 0.72%, and 10.63% of the cinnamon fraction, respectively. We used a macrophage model stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from either Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli to show that the cinnamon fraction dose-dependently reduced IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α secretion. Evidence was brought that this inhibition of cytokine secretion may result from the ability of the fraction to prevent LPS-induced NF-κB activation. We also showed that the cinnamon fraction reduces LPS binding to monocytes, which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties. Lastly, using a competitor assay, it was found that the cinnamon fraction may represent a natural PPAR-γ ligand. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, the cinnamon fraction was shown to exhibit a therapeutic potential for the treatment of periodontal diseases due to its anti-inflammatory properties."
https://openalex.org/W3121116539,"This study compared the current nutritional status, hemoglobin levels and their associations with soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections between two categories of Negritos (indigenous): (i) Inland Jungle Villages (IJV) (ii) and Resettlement Plan Scheme (RPS) near town peripheries, decades after redevelopment and demarginalization. A total of 416 Negritos (IJV: 149; RPS: 267) was included for nutritional profiling based on anthropometric analysis. However, only 196 (IJV: 64; RPS: 132) individuals consented to blood taking for the hemoglobin (Hb) measurements. Subsequently, the association of undernutrition and anemia with STH infections were determined based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The overall prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight amongst children and adolescents (n = 343) were 45.8%, 42.3% and 59.1%, respectively. In adults (n = 73), the prevalence of underweight was low (6.8%) but overweight and obese was prominent (26.0%). For anemia (n = 196), an overall prevalence rate of 68.4% were observed with 80% and 70.4% of children aged 2–6 y/o and aged 7–12 y/o, respectively being anemic. Comparatively, the prevalence of underweight (WAZ) was significantly higher in the RPS versus the IJV (P = 0.03) In the IJV, children aged ≤ 6 y/o and having STH poly-parasitism were associated with underweight (P = 0.01) and moderate-severe T . trichiura infection was associated with anemia. Whilst in the RPS, underweight was highly associated with only T . trichiura infection (P = 0.04). Wasting was significantly associated with young children aged ≤10 in both IJV (P = 0.004) and RPS (P = 0.02). Despite efforts in improving provision of facilities and amenities among the indigenous, this study highlighted a high magnitude of nutritional issues among the Negritos especially those in the RPS and their likely association with STH infections and decades of demarginalization. Joint nutritional intervention strategies with mass anti-helminthic treatment are imperative and urgently needed to reduce the undernutrition problems especially among indigenous children."
https://openalex.org/W3118465682,"Across a variety of contexts, adults tend to cooperate more with ingroup members than outgroup members. However, humans belong to multiple social groups simultaneously and we know little about how this cross-categorization affects cooperative decision-making. Nationality and gender are two social categories that are ripe for exploration in this regard: They regularly intersect in the real world and we know that each affects cooperation in isolation. Here we explore two hypotheses concerning the effects of cross-categorization on cooperative decision-making. First, the additivity hypothesis (H1), which proposes that the effects of social categories are additive, suggesting that people will be most likely to cooperate with partners who are nationality and gender ingroup members. Second, the category dominance hypothesis (H2), which proposes that one category will outcompete the other in driving decision-making, suggesting that either nationality or gender information will be privileged in cooperative contexts. Secondarily, we test whether identification with—and implicit bias toward—nationality and gender categories predict decision-making. Indian and US Americans ( N = 479), made decisions in two cooperative contexts—the Dictator and Prisoner’s Dilemma Games—when paired with partners of all four social categories: Indian women and men, and US American women and men. Nationality exerted a stronger influence than gender: people shared and cooperated more with own-nationality partners and believed that own-nationality partners would be more cooperative. Both identification with—and implicit preferences for—own-nationality, led to more sharing in the Dictator Game. Our findings are most consistent with H2, suggesting that when presented simultaneously, nationality, but not gender, exerts an important influence on cooperative decision-making. Our study highlights the importance of testing cooperation in more realistic intergroup contexts, ones in which multiple social categories are in play."
https://openalex.org/W3119701618,"Song lyrics are rich in meaning. In recent years, the lyrical content of popular songs has been used as an index of culture’s shifting norms, affect, and values. One particular, newly uncovered, trend is that lyrics of popular songs have become increasingly simple over time. Why might this be? Here, we test the idea that increasing lyrical simplicity is accompanied by a widening array of novel song choices. We do so by using six decades (1958–2016) of popular music in the United States ( N = 14,661 songs), controlling for multiple well-studied ecological and cultural factors plausibly linked to shifts in lyrical simplicity (e.g., resource availability, pathogen prevalence, rising individualism). In years when more novel song choices were produced, the average lyrical simplicity of the songs entering U.S. billboard charts was greater. This cross-temporal relationship was robust when controlling for a range of cultural and ecological factors and employing multiverse analyses to control for potentially confounding influence of temporal autocorrelation. Finally, simpler songs entering the charts were more successful, reaching higher chart positions, especially in years when more novel songs were produced. The present results suggest that cultural transmission depends on the amount of novel choices in the information landscape."
https://openalex.org/W3118569616,"Study objective In Asian countries, oral chloral hydrate is the most commonly used sedative for non-invasive procedures. Theoretically, mild sleep deprivation could be considered as one of assisted techniques. However, there is no consensus on sleep deprivation facilitating the sedation during non-painful procedures in children. The aim of our study is to analyze the clinical data of children undergoing non-invasive procedural sedation retrospectively and to evaluate the association between mild sleep deprivation and sedative effects in non-invasive procedures. Measurements Consecutive patients undergoing chloral hydrate sedation for non-invasive procedures between December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 were included in this study. The propensity score analysis with 1: 1 ratio was used to match the baseline variables between patients with sleep deprivation and non-sleep deprivation. The primary outcome was the failure rate of sedation with the initial dose. The secondary outcomes included the failure rate of sedation after supplementation of chloral hydrate, the incidence of major and minor adverse events, initial and supplemental dose of chloral hydrate, and the length of sedation time. Main results Of the 7789 patients undergoing chloral hydrate sedation, 6352 were treated with sleep deprivation and 1437 with non-sleep deprivation. After propensity score matching, 1437 pairs were produced. The failure rate of sedation with initial chlorate hydrate was not significantly different in two groups (8.6% [123/1437] vs. 10.6% [152/1437], p = 0.08), nor were the failure rates with supplemental chlorate hydrate (0.8% [12/1437] vs. 0.9% [13/1437], p = 1) and the length of sedation time (58 [45, 75] vs. 58 [45, 75] min; p = 0.93). Conclusions The current results do not support sleep deprivation have a beneficial effect in reducing the pediatric chloral hydrate sedation failure rate. The routine use of sleep deprivation for pediatric sedation is unnecessary."
https://openalex.org/W3119630000,"The mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is characterized by functional and structural alterations of the diaphragm since early stages of pathology, closely resembling patients’ condition. In recent years, ultrasonography has been proposed as a useful longitudinal non-invasive technique to assess mdx diaphragm dysfunction and evaluate drug efficacy over time. To date, only a few preclinical studies have been conducted. Therefore, an independent validation of this method by different laboratories is needed to increase results reliability and reduce biases. Here, we performed diaphragm ultrasonography in 3- and 6-month-old mdx mice, the preferred age-window for pharmacology studies. The alteration of diaphragm function over time was measured as diaphragm ultrasound movement amplitude. At the same time points, a first-time assessment of diaphragm echodensity was performed, as an experimental index of progressive loss of contractile tissue. A parallel evaluation of other in vivo and ex vivo dystrophy-relevant readouts was carried out. Both 3- and 6-month-old mdx mice showed a significant decrease in diaphragm amplitude compared to wild type (wt) mice. This index was well-correlated either with in vivo running performance or ex vivo isometric tetanic force of isolated diaphragm. In addition, diaphragms from 6-month-old dystrophic mice were also highly susceptible to eccentric contraction ex vivo . Importantly, we disclosed an age-dependent increase in echodensity in mdx mice not observed in wt animals, which was independent from abdominal wall thickness. This was accompanied by a notable increase of pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 levels in the mdx diaphragm and of non-muscle tissue amount in diaphragm sections stained by hematoxylin &amp; eosin. Our findings corroborate the usefulness of diaphragm ultrasonography in preclinical drug studies as a powerful tool to monitor mdx pathology progression since early stages."
https://openalex.org/W3120548654,"Disease mapping aims to determine the underlying disease risk from scattered epidemiological data and to represent it on a smoothed colored map. This methodology is based on Bayesian inference and is classically dedicated to non-infectious diseases whose incidence is low and whose cases distribution is spatially (and eventually temporally) structured. Over the last decades, disease mapping has received many major improvements to extend its scope of application: integrating the temporal dimension, dealing with missing data, taking into account various a prioris (environmental and population covariates, assumptions concerning the repartition and the evolution of the risk), dealing with overdispersion, etc. We aim to adapt this approach to model rare infectious diseases proposing specific and generic variants of this methodology. In the context of a contagious disease, the outcome of a primary case can in addition generate secondary occurrences of the pathology in a close spatial and temporal neighborhood; this can result in local overdispersion and in higher spatial and temporal dependencies due to direct and/or indirect transmission. In consequence, we test models including a Negative Binomial distribution (instead of the usual Poisson distribution) to deal with local overdispersion. We also use a specific spatio-temporal link in order to better model the stronger spatial and temporal dependencies due to the transmission of the disease. We have proposed and tested 60 Bayesian hierarchical models on 400 simulated datasets and bovine tuberculosis real data. This analysis shows the relevance of the CAR (Conditional AutoRegressive) processes to deal with the structure of the risk. We can also conclude that the negative binomial models outperform the Poisson models with a Gaussian noise to handle overdispersion. In addition our study provided relevant maps which are congruent with the real risk (simulated data) and with the knowledge concerning bovine tuberculosis (real data)."
https://openalex.org/W3118514203,"Introduction Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is the safest and healthiest option of feeding among infants in the first 6 months throughout the world. Thus, the promotion of EBF is essential to prevent complex infant health problems even at the adulthood level. But the majority of previous studies focused on individual- level determinants of EBF by using basic regression models in localized areas. This study aimed to identify the determinants of EBF at the individual and community level which would be helpful to design appropriate strategies for improving the practice of EBF. Methods It is a secondary data analysis using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A total of 1185 infants under 6 months of age were included in the analysis. A Multilevel logistic regression model was employed to investigate factors significantly associated with EBF among under-six infants in Ethiopia. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to measure the association of variables whereas Intracluster correlation (ICC), median odds ratio (MOR), and proportional change in variance (PCV) were used to measure random effects (variation). Result In multilevel logistic regression; 4–5 months age infant (AOR = 0.04, 95%CI:0.02–0.07), female infants (AOR = 2.51, 95%CI:1.61–3.91), infant comorbidities (AOR = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.21–0.57), richest household wealth index (AOR = 10.34, 95%CI: 3.14–34.03) and antenatal care (AOR = 2.25, 95%CI:1.32–3.82) were individual- level determinants significantly associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Whereas, contextual region (AOR = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.10–0.87), community- level of postnatal visit (AOR = 2.77, 95%CI: 1.26–6.58) and community -level of maternal employment (AOR = 2.8, 95%CI: 1.21–6.47) were community level determinants significantly associated with EBF. The full model showed that46.8% of the variation of exclusive breastfeeding was explained by the combined factors at the individual and community levels. Similarly, it showed that the variation in exclusive breastfeeding across communities remained statistically significant (ICC = 8.77% and variance = 0.32 with P&lt;0.001). Conclusion and recommendation Our study showed that both individual and community level determinants were significantly associated with EBF practice among under 6 infants. Based on our findings, it is recommended to promote and enhance antenatal and postnatal care services utilization of mothers to improve exclusive breastfeeding practice and more emphasis should be given to infants with comorbid conditions and those who were living in the pastoralist regions."
https://openalex.org/W3118519083,"Background The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising at a rapid pace and is associated with negative health consequences like cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Obesity is a multifactorial problem that develops mainly from lifestyle factors including physical inactivity and poor dietary intake. Dietary diversity is a simplified method for assessing the adequacy and quality of diet and is associated with nutritional need and overall health status. Therefore, we conducted this study to synthesize the associations between consumption of a diversified diet and overweight/ obesity among adults living in pastoral communities in Monduli district in Tanzania. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 510 adults aged ≥ 18 years old in the Monduli district, Arusha region in Tanzania. We conducted face-to-face interviews to collect information about socio-demographic characteristics, 24-hours dietary recall, and anthropometric measurements. The dietary diversity score (DDS) was constructed and used to determine the diversity of the diet consumed. We performed the multivariate Poisson regressions to determine the prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The dependent variables were overweight and general obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI), abdominal obesity measured by waist-hip ratio (WHR) and waist circumference (WC). Results The prevalence of general obesity based on BMI was 20.2% (95%CI; 16.9–23.9), abdominal obesity based on WHR was 37.8% (95%CI; 33.7–42.1), and WC was 29.1% (95%CI; 25.2–33.1). More than half (54.3%) of the participants consumed an adequate dietary diversity (DDS ≥4). After adjustment for potential confounders, the prevalence of abdominal obesity by WHR decreased with higher DDS among male (APR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22–0.77) and female participants (APR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41–0.94). There were inconsistent positive associations between DDS and prevalence of overweight and general obesity among male and female. There was no association between DDS and abdominal obesity by WC. Conclusion More than half of the pastoralists have consumed an adequate diversified diet. Given the inconsistent findings on associations between dietary diversity and obesity measures, this study suggests that targeting dietary diversity as an overweight/obesity prevention strategy requires careful consideration."

Reasons include overreliance on one’s local perspective and ideologically-motivated cognition. We propose a novel mechanism to account for the misperceptions of income inequality. We hypothesize that compared to those who feel less autonomy, the people who believe they are autonomous and have control over their lives also believe that (1) income inequality is lower and (2) income inequality is more acceptable.

We sought to estimate the rates, diagnoses, and characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits among patients transported directly by law enforcement. We analyzed statewide North Carolina Emergency Department data for adults, aged 18+ years, from 2009 to 2016. We estimated transport rates using census data; categorized primary ED diagnoses into 13 major and 8 substituent categories; compared county transport rates by rurality; and examined patient characteristics. There were 136,240 patients transported by law enforcement; annual rates increased from 186.9 (per 100,000 adult residents) in 2009 to 279.2 in 2016. Among visits, 67.7% were among men, the median age was 37 years, and 20.4% resulted in a hospital admission. Most common primary diagnoses were Mental Health Diagnoses (43.1%)—including Schizophrenia and other Psychotic Disorders (7.6%), Mood Disorders (9.7%), and Alcohol and Substance Use (10.7%)—followed by Injury and Poisoning (12.4%) and Circulatory conditions (4.1%). Involuntary commitments constituted 22% of all visits. The median transport rate in rural counties, 291.1, was 2 times that of large metro counties, 145.1. The visit rate increased by nearly 50% during the study period, with the highest rates in rural counties. Many transports were for Mental Illness and involuntary commitments. The relatively common occurrence of law enforcement transports suggests the need for greater research to understand factors influencing law enforcement transport decisions, the impact of these transports on patient health and safety, and the repercussions on patient care of a growing officer presence in EDs."
https://openalex.org/W3120879690,"We investigate aspects of topology in protein folding. For this we numerically simulate the temperature driven folding and unfolding of the slipknotted archaeal virus protein AFV3-109. Due to knottiness the (un)folding is a topological process, it engages the entire backbone in a collective fashion. Accordingly we introduce a topological approach to model the process. Our simulations reveal that the (un)folding of AFV3-109 slipknot proceeds through a folding intermediate that has the topology of a trefoil knot. We observe that the final slipknot causes a slight swelling of the folded AFV3-109 structure. We disclose the relative stability of the strands and helices during both the folding and unfolding processes. We confirm results from previous studies that pointed out that it can be very demanding to simulate the formation of knotty self-entanglement, and we explain how the problems are circumvented: The slipknotted AFV3-109 protein is a very slow folder with a topologically demanding pathway, which needs to be properly accounted for in a simulation description. When we either increase the relative stiffness of bending, or when we decrease the speed of ambient cooling, the rate of slipknot formation rapidly increases."

Period-averaged stress maps are obtained both in the presence and absence of steady flow around the foil. The velocity vector field is determined via volumetric three-component particle tracking velocimetry and subsequently inserted into the Navier-Stokes equation to calculate the total hydrodynamic stress tensor. In addition, we also present a careful error analysis of such measurements, showing that local evaluations of stress distributions are possible. The consistency of the force time-dependence is verified using a control volume analysis. The flapping foil used in the experiments is designed to allow comparison with a small trapezoidal fish fin, in terms of the scaling laws that govern the oscillatory flow regime. As a complementary approach, unsteady Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is employed to derive instantaneous transversal force distributions on the flexible hydrofoil from its deflection and the results are compared to the spatial distributions of hydrodynamic stresses obtained from the fluid velocity field."
https://openalex.org/W3119472341,"The Paleogene succession of the Helmstedt Lignite Mining District in Northern Germany includes coastal peat mire records from the latest Paleocene to the middle Eocene at the southern edge of the Proto-North Sea. Therefore, it covers the different long- and short-term climate perturbations of the Paleogene greenhouse. 56 samples from three individual sections of a lower Eocene seam in the record capture the typical succession of the vegetation in a coastal wetland during a period that was not affected by climate perturbation. This allows facies-dependent vegetational changes to be distinguished from those that were climate induced. Cluster analyses and NMDS of well-preserved palynomorph assemblages reveal four successional stages in the vegetation during peat accumulation: (1) a coastal vegetation, (2) an initial mire, (3) a transitional mire, and (4) a terminal mire. Biodiversity measures show that plant diversity decreased significantly in the successive stages. The highly diverse vegetation at the coast and in the adjacent initial mire was replaced by low diversity communities adapted to wet acidic environments and nutrient deficiency. The palynomorph assemblages are dominated by elements such as Alnus (Betulaceae) or Sphagnum (Sphagnaceae). Typical tropical elements which are characteristic for the middle Eocene part of the succession are missing. This indicates that a more warm-temperate climate prevailed in northwestern Germany during the early lower Eocene."
https://openalex.org/W3119510360,"Species distribution models are useful for identifying the ecological characteristics that may limit a species’ geographic range and for inferring patterns of speciation. Here, we test a hypothesis of niche conservatism across evolutionary time in a group of manakins (Aves: Pipridae), with a focus on Chiroxiphia boliviana , and examine the degree of ecological differentiation with other Chiroxiphia and Antilophia manakins. We tested whether allopatric sister species were more or less similar in environmental space than expected given their phylogenetic distances, which would suggest, respectively, ecological niche conservatism over time or ecologically mediated selection (i.e. niche divergence). We modeled the distribution of nine manakin taxa ( C . boliviana , C . caudata , C . lanceolata , C . linearis , C . p . pareola , C . p . regina , C . p . napensis , Antilophia galeata and A . bokermanni ) using Maxent. We first performed models for each taxon and compared them. To test our hypothesis we followed three approaches: (1) we tested whether C . boliviana could predict the distribution of the other manakin taxa and vice versa; (2) we compared the ecological niches by using metrics of niche overlap, niche equivalency and niche similarity; and (3) lastly, we tested whether niche differentiation corresponded to phylogenetic distances calculated from two recent phylogenies. All models had high training and test AUC values. Mean AUC ratios were high (&gt;0.8) for most taxa, indicating performance better than random. Results suggested niche conservatism, and high niche overlap and equivalency between C . boliviana and C . caudata , but we found very low values between C . boliviana and the rest of the taxa.

https://openalex.org/W3119627818,"Two new wood-inhabiting fungal species, Steccherinum tenuissimum and S . xanthum spp. nov. are described based on a combination of morphological features and molecular evidence. Steccherinum tenuissimum is characterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate basidiomata with an odontioid hymenial surface, a dimitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae, strongly encrusted cystidia and basidiospores measuring 3–5 × 2–3.5 μm. Steccherinum xanthum is characterized by odontioid basidiomata and a monomitic hyphal system with generative hyphae bearing clamp connections and covering by crystals, colourless, thin-walled, smooth, IKI–, CB–and has basidiospores measuring 2.7–5.5 × 1.8–4.0 μm. Sequences of the ITS and nLSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied samples were generated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data of ITS + nLSU sequences showed that two new Steccherinum species felled into the residual polyporoid clade. Further investigation was obtained for more representative taxa in Steccherinum based on ITS + nLSU sequences, which demonstrated that S . tenuissimum and S . xanthum were sister to S . robustius with high support (100% BP, 100% BS and 1.00 BPP)."
https://openalex.org/W3118992036,"Background Family planning is a key means to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals. Around the world, governments and partners have prioritized investments to increase access to and uptake of family planning methods. In Uttar Pradesh, India, the government and its partners have made significant efforts to increase awareness, supply, and access to modern contraceptives. Despite progress, uptake remains stubbornly low. This calls for systematic research into understanding the ‘why’—why people are or aren’t using modern methods, what drives their decisions, and who influences them. Methods We use a mixed-methods approach, analyzing three existing quantitative data sets to identify trends and geographic variation, gaps and contextual factors associated with family planning uptake and collecting new qualitative data through in-depth immersion interviews, journey mapping, and decision games to understand systemic and individual-level barriers to family planning use, household decision making patterns and community level barriers. Results We find that reasons for adoption of family planning are complex–while access and awareness are critical, they are not sufficient for increasing uptake of modern methods. Although awareness is necessary for uptake, we found a steep drop-off (59%) between high awareness of modern contraceptive methods and its intention to use, and an additional but smaller drop-off from intention to actual use (9%). While perceived access, age, education and other demographic variables partially predict modern contraceptive intention to use, the qualitative data shows that other behavioral drivers including household decision making dynamics, shame to obtain modern contraceptives, and high-risk perception around side-effects also contribute to low intention to use modern contraceptives. The data also reveals that strong norms and financial considerations by couples are the driving force behind the decision to use and when to use family planning methods. Conclusion The finding stresses the need to shift focus towards building intention, in addition to ensuring access of trained staff, and commodities drugs and equipment, and building capacities of health care providers."
https://openalex.org/W3119468655,"The Arab population encompasses over 420 million people characterized by genetic admixture and a consequent rich genetic diversity. A number of genetic diseases have been reported for the first time from the population. Additionally a high prevalence of some genetic diseases including autosomal recessive disorders such as hemoglobinopathies and familial mediterranean fever have been found in the population and across the region. There is a paucity of databases cataloguing genetic variants of clinical relevance from the population. The availability of such a catalog could have implications in precise diagnosis, genetic epidemiology and prevention of disease. To fill in the gap, we have compiled DALIA, a comprehensive compendium of genetic variants reported in literature and implicated in genetic diseases reported from the Arab population. The database aims to act as an effective resource for population-scale and sub-population specific variant analyses, enabling a ready reference aiding clinical interpretation of genetic variants, genetic epidemiology, as well as facilitating rapid screening and a quick reference for evaluating evidence on genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3120246606,"Background Marrying principles of evidence-based policymaking, with its focus on what works , with principles of consultative policymaking, with its focus on what works for whom , means finding ways to integrate multiple knowledge inputs into policy decisions. Viewed through the lens of the embodied-enacted-inscribed knowledge framework, policy consultation is a site of knowledge enactment, where the embodied knowledge enacted by individuals engages with the inscribed knowledge contained in policy documents, creating new forms of embodied and inscribed knowledge that move beyond these spaces. Aim Using this knowledge framework, this study aimed to trace the movement of knowledge inputs through South Africa’s mental health policy consultation summit. Methods Breakaway group session transcripts from the national consultation summit were thematically analysed to identify the types of knowledge that participants explicitly drew on (experiential or evidence-based) during discussions and how these knowledge inputs were used, responded to, and captured. Findings Findings suggest that there was little explicit reference to either evidence-based or experiential knowledge in most of the talk. While slightly more evidence-based than experiential knowledge claims were made, this did not render these claims any more likely to be responded to or engaged with in group discussions, or to be inscribed in group recommendations. Discussion The importance of designing participatory processes that enable optimal use of knowledge inputs in these enacted spaces is discussed. Conclusion Attending to the specific ways in which knowledge is transformed and moved through a policy consultation process has the potential to enhance the value that consultation offers policymakers."

The study will provide new evidence on the regulation of neutrophil maturation during hematopoiesis. Neutrophils are the most abundant phagocytes essential for the first line of defense in the innate immune system. Mature neutrophils play an important role in pathogen clearance, response to tissue injury, and in mediating the inflammatory response (1Kruger P. Saffarzadeh M. Weber A.N. Rieber N. Radsak M. von Bernuth H. Benarafa C. Roos D. Skokowa J. Hartl D.

Thus, understanding how neutrophils differentiate into functional mature cells might facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neutrophil-related disorders. The function of mature neutrophils requires the development of characteristic neutrophil granules along with stored enzymes. These neutrophil-specific elements are formed at different stages during neutrophil maturation. Mammalian neutrophils contain four types of granules: azurophil granules, specific granules, gelatinase granules, and secretory granules. Each subtype of granule contains highly specific storage proteins that carry out different immune functions (8Pham C.T. Neutrophil serine proteases: Specific regulators of inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Neutrophil granule subtypes are released in order to lyse and eradicate microbes when neutrophils are activated during infections (2Borregaard N. Neutrophils, from marrow to microbes.Immunity. 2010; 33: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Digestive enzymes are key components in neutrophil granules. For example, lysozyme C (Lyz), is a key bactericidal enzyme found in all types of neutrophil granules, and myeloperoxidase (Mpx) is an abundant peroxidase stored in neutrophil azurophilic granules (2Borregaard N. Neutrophils, from marrow to microbes.Immunity. 2010; 33: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Sorting and packing neutrophil granule proteins by proteoglycans, such as serglycin (Srgn), are essential for neutrophil differentiation (9Niemann C.U. Cowland J.B. Klausen P. Askaa J. Calafat J. Borregaard N. Localization of serglycin in human neutrophil granulocytes and their precursors.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 76: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Niemann C.U. Abrink M.

Neutrophil elastase depends on serglycin proteoglycan for localization in granules.Blood. 2007; 109: 4478-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Neutrophil maturation requires that these granule-related proteins are properly produced, yet the molecular basis controlling the process remains largely unknown. Several hematopoietic-specific transcription factors are reported to control neutrophil granule-related protein expression. RUNX1 has been described as a pivotal transcription factor during definitive hematopoiesis (11Ezoe S. Matsumura I. Satoh Y. Tanaka H. Kanakura Y. Cell cycle regulation in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 314-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Okuda T. Deursen J.V. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing R J.

Ferreira C. Influence of nutrient-derived metabolites on lymphocyte immunity.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In neutrophil development, Runx1 is reported to promote granulocytic over monocytic lineage fate choice in zebrafish (14Jin H. Li L. Xu J. Zhen F. Zhu L. Liu P.P. Zhang M. Zhang W. Wen Z. Runx1 regulates embryonic myeloid fate choice in zebrafish through a negative feedback loop inhibiting Pu.1 expression.Blood. 2012; 119: 5239-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Yet, the function of RUNX1 in neutrophil differentiation and maturation is still debatable. It has been reported that RUNX1 could regulate Mpx and Elane transcription in myeloid cell lines (15Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow J. Hiebert S. Friedman A.D. PEBP2/CBF, the murine homolog of the human myeloid AML1 and PEBP2 beta/CBF beta proto-oncoproteins, regulates the murine myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase genes in immature myeloid cells.Mol.

Rep. 2018; 8: 11902Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Similarly, recent mouse data demonstrated that RUNX1-haploinsufficient hematopoietic progenitors impaired in vitro differentiation in neutrophils by repressing Cebpe expression (18Ng K.P. Hu Z. Ebrahem Q. Negrotto S. Lausen J. Saunthararajah Y. Runx1 deficiency permits granulocyte lineage commitment but impairs subsequent maturation.Oncogenesis. 2013; 2: e78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, another study found that conditional ablation of the Runx1 gene in adult mice paradoxically expands myeloid pools to an extent without incurring any discernible differentiation blockage (19Growney J.D. Shigematsu H. Li Z. Lee B.H. Adelsperger J. Rowan R. Curley D.P. Kutok J.L. Akashi K. Williams I.R. Speck N.A. Gilliland D.G. Loss of Runx1 perturbs adult hematopoiesis and is associated with a myeloproliferative phenotype.Blood. 2005; 106: 494-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether RUNX1 plays roles in granulocyte differentiation and maturation in vivo is still unclear, especially in early developmental stages. We previously showed that lyz is a direct target of c-Myb in regulating neutrophil maturation (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lyz is also a transcriptional target of Runx1 (21Kitaguchi T. Kawakami K. Kawahara A. Transcriptional regulation of a myeloid-lineage specific gene lysozyme C during zebrafish myelopoiesis.Mech. Dev. 2009; 126: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); however, whether RUNX1 participates in neutrophil differentiation and maturation lacks sufficient in vivo evidence. Furthermore, whether the neutrophil maturation process is achieved by the orchestration of these two transcription factors requires genetic verification. Here, we used two hematopoietic-defective zebrafish mutants, runx1w84x (22Jin H. Sood R. Xu J. Zhen F. English M.A. Liu P.P. Wen Z. Definitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells manifest distinct differentiation output in the zebrafish VDA and PBI.Development. 2009; 136: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and c-mybhkz3 (23Zhang Y. Jin H. Li L. Qin F.X. Wen Z. cMyb regulates hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell mobilization during zebrafish hematopoiesis.Blood. 2011; 118: 4093-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to determine the role of Runx1 during neutrophil maturation. These mutants were used to elucidate the genetic interaction of the two transcription factors through genetic epistasis and biochemical analysis. It was found that Runx1 cooperates with c-Myb to control neutrophil maturation in zebrafish embryonic myelopoiesis. This study elucidates the genetic networks that orchestrate primitive myeloid cell development, improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of neutrophil-related diseases. Mature neutrophils are characterized by abundant granules in the cytoplasm, which can be specifically stained by Sudan Black B (SB) (14Jin H. Li L. Xu J. Zhen F. Zhu L. Liu P.P. Zhang M. Zhang W. Wen Z. Runx1 regulates embryonic myeloid fate choice in zebrafish through a negative feedback loop inhibiting Pu.1 expression.Blood. 2012; 119: 5239-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Le G.D. Redd M.J. Colucciguyon E. Murayama E. Kissa K. Briolat V. Mordelet E. Zapata A. Shinomiya H. Herbomel P. Origins and unconventional behavior of neutrophils in developing zebrafish.Blood. 2008; 111: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Similar to the phenotype of c-myb−/− mutants in primitive myelopoiesis (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), runx1−/− mutants had reduced the number of SB+ neutrophils at 36 h postfertilization (hpf) (14Jin H. Li L. Xu J. Zhen F. Zhu L. Liu P.P. Zhang M. Zhang W. Wen Z. Runx1 regulates embryonic myeloid fate choice in zebrafish through a negative feedback loop inhibiting Pu.1 expression.Blood. 2012; 119: 5239-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). More importantly, the signal intensity for SB staining of the neutrophils was lower in mutants compared with that in siblings (Fig. 1, A, B and D), suggesting that Runx1 is involved in neutrophil maturation. Since mature neutrophils have abundant granules in their cytosol, video-enhanced differential interference contrast (VE DIC) (25Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Ontogeny and behaviour of early macrophages in the zebrafish embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 3735-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) microscopy was used to observe neutrophil granule status and abundance in live embryos at 2 days postfertilization (dpf) in Tg(mpx:GFP) background. GFP was expressed mainly in neutrophils under the control of the neutrophil-specific promoter (26Renshaw S.A. Loynes C.A. Trushell D.M. Elworthy S. Ingham P.W. Whyte M.K. A transgenic zebrafish model of neutrophilic inflammation.Blood. 2006; 108: 3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Although mpx:GFP+ cell numbers were decreased and the expression was weakened in the mutants, we could still catch the remaining mpx:GFP+ neutrophils under the microscopy. Indeed, runx1−/− mutants contained fewer mature neutrophils than observed in siblings (Fig. 1, E, F, E’, F’ and G–I). Mature neutrophils were also characterized by banded and segmented nuclei (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Lieschke G.J. Oates A.C. Crowhurst M.O. Ward A.C. Layton J.E. Morphologic and functional characterization of granulocytes and macrophages in embryonic and adult zebrafish.Blood. 2001; 98: 3087-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, mature and immature neutrophils were quantified by staining nuclei with May–Grünwald–Giemsa stain. These studies showed a significant decrease in mature neutrophils in 2-dpf runx1−/− mutants compared with siblings (Fig. 1, J and K). The data demonstrate that primitive neutrophils were affected by the runx1 mutation in zebrafish. To determine the role of runx1 in relation with c-myb in neutrophil maturation, a genetic approach was used to compare the neutrophil phenotypes of single runx1 or c-myb mutants with composite mutants derived from crossing c-myb+/−;runx1+/− double heterozygotes. Since c-myb+/− heterozygous embryos were indistinguishable from wild-type embryos in the number of SB+ cells at 36 hpf (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we focused on the phenotype comparisons of c-myb+/−;runx1−/− double mutants and c-myb+/− and runx1−/− single mutants to determine whether additional c-myb+/− heterozygotes would yield more severe phenotypes. When one allele of c-myb+/− was introduced into runx1−/−, the number of SB+ cells was further reduced (Fig. 2, A–E). Consistently, the c-myb−/−;runx1−/− double homozygotes had nearly no SB+ cells left (data not shown). Furthermore, the DIC microscopy of live embryos (Fig. 2, F–I, F’–I’ and J–K) showed that the residual neutrophils in c-myb+/−;runx1−/− (Fig. 2, I and I’) elicited more immature characteristics, with scarce granules almost lacking mpx:GFP expression when compared with c-myb+/−;runx1+/+ (Fig. 2, G and G’) or c-myb+/+;runx1−/− mutants (Fig. 2, H and H’). To determine whether the synergistic regulation by c-Myb and Runx1 has biological consequences on neutrophil function, we examined the rate of bacterial killing by neutrophils in each group. As expected, additive c-myb+/− further attenuated the runx1−/− bacterial killing activity, as c-myb+/−;runx1−/− mutants prolonged the bacterial clearance time compared with runx1−/− single mutants (Fig. 2L). The above data suggest that runx1 could genetically cooperate with c-myb to potentiate neutrophil maturation. Similar to mammals, zebrafish neutrophil maturation also required typical neutrophil granule-related components and digestive enzymes, such as Lyz, Mpx, and nephrosin (Npsn), to be properly produced (2Borregaard N. Neutrophils, from marrow to microbes.Immunity. 2010; 33: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 28Cuartero S. Weiss F.D. Dharmalingam G. Guo Y. Ing-Simmons E.

Dowell R.D. et al.Control of inducible gene expression links cohesin to hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal and differentiation.Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been reported that zebrafish lyz is directly targeted by c-Myb (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and transcriptionally regulated by Runx1 (21Kitaguchi T. Kawakami K. Kawahara A. Transcriptional regulation of a myeloid-lineage specific gene lysozyme C during zebrafish myelopoiesis.Mech. Dev. 2009; 126: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but whether lyz could be coactivated by c-Myb and Runx1 in vivo is unclear. To test the combined effects, whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was performed to compare lyz expressions between c-myb+/−;runx1+/− crossed embryos. Our laboratory previously showed that c-myb−/− homozygotes had almost no lyz+ cells (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1, A and A’), that the signal numbers between c-myb+/−;runx1+/+ and c-myb+/+;runx1+/+ were comparable (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that one c-myb allele deficiency (c-myb+/− heterozygous) does not affect lyz+ signals when the runx1 gene is not mutated. In c-myb+/+;runx1−/− embryos (Fig. 3C), the runx1−/− homozygous mutation decreased lyz+ cells to one-third of those in c-myb+/+;runx1+/+ embryos (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the inadequate lyz+ cells in runx1−/− background mutants were further reduced when one allele of c-myb+/− was introduced, as the average lyz+ cell number per embryo was decreased from 30 in c-myb+/+;runx1−/− (Fig. 3C) to 10 in c-myb+/−;runx1−/− (Fig. 3, D and E). The above data suggest a synergistic regulation of the two transcription factors on the expression of lyz. Since neutrophil maturation requires proper sequential expression of digestive enzymes, it was hypothesized that the synergistic effects of c-myb and runx1 are likely for lyz, as well as for other related genes. Zebrafish Mpx and Npsn are both neutrophil-specific granzymes used for host clearance of microbe infections (28Cuartero S. Weiss F.D. Dharmalingam G. Guo Y. Ing-Simmons E. Masella S. Robles-Rebollo I. Xiao X. Wang Y.F. Barozzi I. Djeghloul D. Amano M.T. Niskanen H. Petretto E. Dowell R.D. et al.Control of inducible gene expression links cohesin to hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal and differentiation.Nat.

Myeloperoxidase-deficient zebrafish show an augmented inflammatory response to challenge with Candida albicans.Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2015; 44: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, both mpx+ and npsn+ cells were further reduced when one or two alleles of the c-myb mutation were introduced in runx1−/− mutants (Fig. 3, F–O, and Fig. S1, B, C, B’ and C’). Moreover, the granule-formation-related glycoprotein-srgn was greatly downregulated in c-myb zebrafish mutants (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting srgn is also regulated by c-Myb. Expectedly, in c-myb+/−;runx1−/− double mutants, srgn+ cells showed a greater inhibition compared with c-myb+/− or runx1−/− single mutants (Fig. 3, P–T and Fig. S1, D and D’). Consistently, the c-myb−/−;runx1−/− double mutants showed the least amount of expression of those genes (Fig. S1, D and D’). The above data suggest that there is a synergistic regulation of c-myb and runx1 on downstream neutrophil maturation-related genes. Taken together, these results indicate that Runx1, cooperatively with c-Myb, is essential for neutrophil maturation by positively regulating neutrophil maturation-related genes. To determine whether the four genes (lyz, mpx, npsn, and srgn) are directly targeted by c-Myb and Runx1, the regulatory regions of these genes were analyzed. It was found that these genes have putative c-Myb and Runx1 binding sites (Fig. 4A). Chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-PCR) assays were performed to ascertain whether the two transcription factors can directly bind to the putative sites in vivo. To address this question, embryos were injected with Myc-tagged c-myb or runx1 plasmids to overexpress c-Myb and Runx1 for ChIP-PCR analysis in zebrafish. The results showed that all putative binding sites of the target genes were coprecipitated using an anti-MYC antibody (Fig. 4B). This result demonstrates that these neutrophil-specific genes are all directly regulated by c-Myb and Runx1 respectively. To further support the hypothesis, the in vivo GFP reporter assay was performed by expressing neutrophil-specific reporter constructs together with c-myb or runx1 overexpression plasmids in zebrafish embryos. As reported, by using the zebrafish reporter assay c-Myb overexpression increased lyz promoter transcription activity (20Jin H. Huang Z. Chi Y. Wu M. Zhou R. Zhao L. Xu J. Zhen F. Lan Y. Li L. Zhang W. Wen Z. Zhang Y. c-Myb acts in parallel and cooperatively with Cebp1 to regulate neutrophil maturation in zebrafish.Blood. 2016; 128: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present report, it was also found that c-Myb overexpression increased mpx, npsn, and srgn promoter transcription activity (Fig. 4C). Compared with overexpressing c-Myb only, transcription activation of the four target genes were all enhanced by Runx1 coexpression (Fig. 4C). This suggests a cooperation of c-Myb and Runx1 on targeting downstream genes. Next, it was asked whether c-Myb and Runx1 physically interact in these molecular functions. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments were performed in 293T cells cotransfected with runx1-Flag and Myc-c-myb constructs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody, followed by western blot analysis using anti-MYC and anti-FLAG antibodies. Immunoprecipitating Runx1-FLAG resulted in coprecipitation of MYC-c-Myb (Fig. 4D). This suggests protein-level cooperation between zebrafish Runx1 and c-Myb. In addition, the co-IP assay was performed in zebrafish embryos. The result was consistent with that observed in the 293T cells (Fig. S2). To identify the regions of c-Myb and Runx1 that are necessary for their interaction, zebrafish c-Myb and Runx1 proteins were further truncated for the co-IP assay. The results showed that the DNA binding domain (DBD) of c-Myb and Runt homologs domain (RHD) of Runx1 are predominantly responsible for the observed interaction (Fig. 4, E and F). However, the constructs for overexpressing truncated c-Myb or Runx1 proteins were injected into c-mybhkz3 and runx1w84x mutants respectively, but the overexpression could not rescue the neutrophil defects in these two mutants (data not shown). These data suggest that the truncated proteins may also affect the essential functions of these proteins, such as DNA binding activity. The final experiment was designed to explore whether there exists a mutual dependency on c-myb and runx1 expression in early neutrophil progenitors. Expression levels were checked at 18 hpf, a crucial stage in embryogenesis when zebrafish myelopoiesis arises directly from the rostral blood island (RBI) (24Le G.D. Redd M.J. Colucciguyon E.

Biol. 2002; 246: 274Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the RBI region, c-myb expression was found to be unchanged in runx1−/− embryos (Fig. S3, A and B), and runx1 expression was also unaltered in c-myb−/− embryos (Fig. S3, C and D). These expression data suggest that c-myb and runx1 are transcriptionally independent of each other during early neutrophil development. From the genetic epistasis and biochemical analysis, it can be concluded that Runx1 functions as a positive regulator for neutrophil maturation in early development. In addition, it interacts and cooperates with c-Myb to transactivate a panel of neutrophil maturation-related genes (Fig. 5). In this study, by utilizing the zebrafish model, the in vivo roles of Runx1 were elucidated in neutrophil maturation. The results demonstrated a cooperative genetic and molecular interaction between Runx1 and c-Myb in regulating neutrophil development. These data give crucial insights into the genetic and molecular orchestration involved in neutrophil maturation. In hematopoiesis, RUNX1 is known to function in the formation of hematopoietic stem cells (12Okuda T. Deursen J.V. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing R J.

Loss of runx1 function results in B cell immunodeficiency but not T cell in adult zebrafish.Open Biol. 2018; 8: 180043Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, RUNX1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in a variety of hematological malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia and familial platelet disorder (34Eaves C.J. Hematopoietic stem cells: Concepts, definitions, and the new reality.Blood. 2015; 125: 2605-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 35Osato M. Asou N. Abdalla E. Hoshino K. Yamasaki H.

Biallelic and heterozygous point mutations in the runt domain of the AML1/PEBP2alphaB gene associated with myeloblastic leukemias.Blood. 1999; 93: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high incidence of RUNX1 mutations in multiple types of hematologic malignancies provides strong evidence for its essential function in blood lineage development. At present, more than 50 chromosome translocations that affect RUNX1 function have been identified, most of which cause maturation arrest of myeloid cells and even leukemia (36De Braekeleer E. Douet-Guilbert N. Morel F. Le Bris M.J. Ferec C. De Braekeleer M. RUNX1 translocations and fusion genes in malignant hemopathies.Future Oncol. 2011; 7: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that RUNX1 is part of a transcriptional complex that regulates important target genes in myelopoiesis. The key questions that remain to be answered are precisely what mechanisms and target genes underlie myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis and how they can be used for developing potential targeted therapies for these patients. From previous mouse studies, the precise role of RUNX1 in primitive myelopoiesis is still unknown. The present study provides direct evidence of a novel function of Runx1 and its regulatory mechanism in the primitive neutrophil maturation process. The clarification of in vivo roles of Runx1 in early myeloid cell development will shed new light on a better understanding of RUNX1-related hematological diseases. Neutrophil maturation requires a set of neutrophil granule-related products that are gradually produced while granules are properly assembled. The lack of granule contents will lead to immature or dysfunctional neutrophils and ultimately immunodeficiency. In c-myb and runx1 mutants, neutrophil granule formation was severely blocked. In addition, granzyme genes were inhibited as well as an observed downregulation of the granule sorting and packing-related proteoglycan gene, srgn. These results underscored the interplay of c-Myb and Runx1 cooperatively controlling neutrophil development by transactivating a cluster of neutrophil maturation-related genes. It was also reported that the ETS family, C/ebp family, and Runx family of transcription factors all function in forming comprehensive genetic networks in myelopoiesis (37Friedman A.D. Transcriptional control of granulocyte and monocyte development.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6816-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 38Friedman A.D.

Immunol. 1996; 211: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, how myeloid-lineage-specific genes are regulated by different transcription factors is of great interest for future studies. In addition, precisely why these transcription factor pairs function in neutrophils remains to be determined. It is possible that during neutrophil development, transcription factors might be sequentially expressed in different subpopulations of developing neutrophils and/or they might be activated by the same factor. It will be important to derive a comprehensive target gene list of c-Myb and Runx1. In addition, it is crucial to find upstream factors and interacting proteins to elucidate the comprehensive regulation of the neutrophil maturation process. Taken together, this study has demonstrated the in vivo role of Runx1 in neutrophil maturation during early myelopoiesis. Furthermore, a genetic interaction between the two transcription factors, Runx1 and c-Myb, was shown to regulate neutrophil maturation through a molecular interaction that functions to regulate genes expression in a cooperative manner. This study improved our understanding of the genetic networks that orchestrate primitive myeloid cell development and revealed the molecular basis of neutrophil-related disease pathogenesis. Zebrafish runx1 (Gene ID: 58126) and c-myb (Gene ID: 30519) were used in the study. The following strains were utilized: AB, Tg(mpx:GFP)i114 (26Renshaw S.A. Loynes C.A. Trushell D.M. Elworthy S. Ingham P.W. Whyte M.K. A transgenic zebrafish model of neutrophilic inflammation.Blood. 2006; 108: 3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), runx1w84x (22Jin H. Sood R. Xu J. Zhen F. English M.A. Liu P.P. Wen Z. Definitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells manifest distinct differentiation output in the zebrafish VDA and PBI.Development. 2009; 136: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and c-mybhkz3 (23Zhang Y. Jin H. Li L. Qin F.X. Wen Z. cMyb regulates hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell mobilization during zebrafish hematopoiesis.Blood. 2011; 118: 4093-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). runx1w84x mutant harbors a G to A nucleotide substitution resulting a premature truncation in the Runt domain of the Runx1 protein. This truncation removes most of the residues important in Runx1 activity, such as CBFb and DNA binding, and nuclear localization signal. c-mybhkz3 mutant harbors a splice mutation that results in the synthesis of a truncated c-Myb protein lacking its transactivation domain. Zebrafish were maintained in accordance with the Guidelines from the Animal Care and Use Committee of South China University of Technology. All experimental protocols were approved by the Division of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology. Fish embryos were anesthetized in 90% PBS + 10% FBS containing 0.02% tricaine. After tail clipping using syringe needle, blood cells were collected by pipetting and cytospun onto slides by centrifugation at 450 rpm for 3 min using a Cytospin 4 (Thermo Scientific). The slides were then airdried and subjected to May–Grünwald–Giemsa (Merk) staining according to the standard protocol. Each group was collected from ∼150 embryos. WISH and SB staining were performed at 36 hpf onward according to previous report (24Le G.D. Redd M.J. Colucciguyon E. Murayama E. Kissa K. Briolat V. Mordelet E. Zapata A. Shinomiya H. Herbomel P.

A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio).4th Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene2000Google Scholar), as primitive neutrophils were evident for detection. Relative ratio of SB signal intensity was calculated by Image J software. Heat-shock-inducible constructs (hsp70:Myc-c-myb and hsp70: Myc-runx1) were generated by inserting Myc-c-myb and Myc-runx1 into the pTol vectors under the control of the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) promoter. Embryos injected with plasmids were incubated at 39.5 °C for 1 h heat shock treatment at 24 hpf. 293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Cell transfection, cell extracts preparation, immunoprecipitation, and western Blot have been described (42Huang M. Qian F. Hu Y. Ang C. Li Z. Wen Z. Chromatin-remodelling factor BRG1 selectively activates a subset of interferon-alpha-inducible genes.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Constructs with Myc-tagged zebrafish c-myb and Flag-tagged zebrafish runx1 were transfected into 293T cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitants were examined by western blot using anti-MYC and anti-FLAG antibodies. Input represents 10% of total cell lysates used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-MYC and anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz (sc-40) and Sigma (ab6658), respectively. VE DIC microscopy was done with 60×/1.00 NA water-immersion objective mounted on Nikon 90i microscope according to previously described (25Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Ontogeny and behaviour of early macrophages in the zebrafish embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 3735-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 2-dpf live embryos, the neutrophil granule status is easy to be detected with DIC assay since the neutrophil granules are abundant and neutrophils are accessible to be observed by the lens. Putative transcriptional binding sites were identified by JASPAR online software. Embryos were injected with Myc-c-myb or Myc-runx1 plasmids at one-cell stage. Six hundred injected embryos were harvested at 2 dpf for brief fixation. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody or anti-IgG antibody (negative control) according to the procedure described by Hart et al. (43Hart D.O. Raha T. Lawson N.D. Green R M. Initiation of zebrafish haematopoiesis by the TATA-box-binding protein-related factor Trf3.Nature. 2007; 450: 1082-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitants were subjected to semiquantitative PCR. ChIP primers could be found in Table S1. The Tg(mpx:GFP) background zebrafish were anaesthetized at 2 dpf with tricaine (MS-222; Sigma-Aldrich) and injected in the tail muscle with approximately 200 c. f. u. dsRed-labled E. coli. Embryos were anaesthetized with tricaine and mounted in 1% (w/v) low-melting-point agarose for time-lapse microscopy. Bacterial clearance time in mpx:GFP+ neutrophils was counted. Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism6 software using the Student t-test for comparisons between two groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; with Tukey posttest adjustment) among multiple groups.

https://openalex.org/W3118315775,"Background Very little high quality evidence exists on the causal relationship between income poverty and childhood health. We provide a comprehensive overview of the association between household income poverty and hospitalisations for children. Methods We used New Zealand’s Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) to link income poverty data from the Survey of Family, Income and Employment (SoFIE; n = 21,759 households) and the 2013 New Zealand Census (n = 523,302 households) to publicly funded hospital records of children aged 0–17 (SoFIE: n = 39,459; Census, n = 986,901). Poverty was defined as equivalised household income below 60% of the median income, calculated both before and after housing costs, and using both self-reported and tax-recorded income. Results Correlations for the association between income poverty and hospitalisation were small (ranging from 0.02 to 0.05) and risk ratios were less than 1.35 for all but the rarest outcome—oral health hospitalisation. Weak or absent associations were apparent across age groups, waves of data collection, cumulative effects, and for estimates generated from fixed effects models and random effect models adjusted for age and ethnicity. Alternative measures of deprivation (area-level deprivation and material deprivation) showed stronger associations with hospitalisations (risk ratios ranged from 1.27–2.55) than income-based poverty measures. Conclusion Income poverty is at best weakly associated with hospitalisation in childhood. Measures of deprivation may have a stronger association. Income measures alone may not be sufficient to capture the diversity of household economic circumstances when assessing the poverty-health relationship."

There is an urgent need to spread safe abortion services in the community. This study assessed the MA kit dispensing practices of community pharmacies in Pokhara Valley, Nepal. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in Pokhara Valley, Nepal from December 2017 to November 2018. Among the community pharmacies of Pokhara Valley, 115 community pharmacies were selected using a consecutive sampling method. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data. MA kit and related information were requested by simulated male clients visiting the community pharmacies. The information obtained from the pharmacy workers was recorded in the data collection sheet. Results Nine brands of MA kit from eight manufacturing companies were found in practice in Pokhara Valley, out of those only five (56%) were registered in Nepal. Seven brands were sold at more than the labeled price. The pharmacy workers asked about the gestational age and confirmation of pregnancy in all the cases. Most of them counseled the clients on the frequency, duration, and direction of use. Dispensing practice and level of counseling were found to be significantly correlated (r = 0.40, p value = 0.01). Conclusion Despite the awareness of the pharmacy workers on the MA kit, most of them provided limited information to the clients. Nearly half unregistered MA kits were found in practice at the community pharmacies. Thus, the Department of Drugs Administration and other concerned authorities must provide relevant training and awareness programs to the pharmacy workers of the community pharmacies for preventing the malpractice of MA kit. The Government of Nepal must restrict the illegal entry of unregistered brands and assure the standards of MA kit by regulating drug acts and policies effectively."
https://openalex.org/W3120946457,"The formation of molybdenum diselenide (MoSe 2 ) is widely observed at the back-contact interface for copper zinc tin selenide (CZTSe) thin-film solar cells. Depending on individual selenium (Se) supply and thermal conditions for forming CZTSe absorbers on molybdenum (Mo) substrates, the thickness of MoSe 2 can vary from a few hundreds of nanometers up to ≈ 1 μm, which is comparable to the commonly adopted thickness of 1 ~ 1.5 μm for CZTSe absorbers. In this study, for controlling the thickness of interfacial MoSe 2 , thin diffusion barrier layers of silicon oxynitride (SiO x N y ) are deposited onto Mo layers prior to the growth of CZTSe absorbers in the fabrication process. As a result, a reduction in the thicknesses of MoSe 2 layers is achieved. In terms of energy conversion efficiency ( η ), CZTSe solar cells grown on Mo/SiO x N y back contacts suffer a deterioration as the SiO x N y layers get thicker. CZTSe solar cells grown on Mo/SiO x N y /Mo back contacts preserve their efficiencies at ≈ 11% with thin 10 nm SiO x N y layers."
