https://openalex.org/W3006795663,"Regressions and meta-regressions are widely used to estimate patterns and effect sizes in various disciplines. However, many biological and medical analyses use relatively low sample size (N), contributing to concerns on reproducibility. What is the minimum N to identify the most plausible data pattern using regressions? Statistical power analysis is often used to answer that question, but it has its own problems and logically should follow model selection to first identify the most plausible model. Here we make null, simple linear and quadratic data with different variances and effect sizes. We then sample and use information theoretic model selection to evaluate minimum N for regression models. We also evaluate the use of coefficient of determination (R2) for this purpose; it is widely used but not recommended. With very low variance, both false positives and false negatives occurred at N < 8, but data shape was always clearly identified at N ≥ 8. With high variance, accurate inference was stable at N ≥ 25. Those outcomes were consistent at different effect sizes. Akaike Information Criterion weights (AICc wi) were essential to clearly identify patterns (e.g., simple linear vs. null); R2 or adjusted R2 values were not useful. We conclude that a minimum N = 8 is informative given very little variance, but minimum N ≥ 25 is required for more variance. Alternative models are better compared using information theory indices such as AIC but not R2 or adjusted R2. Insufficient N and R2-based model selection apparently contribute to confusion and low reproducibility in various disciplines. To avoid those problems, we recommend that research based on regressions or meta-regressions use N ≥ 25."
https://openalex.org/W3006898855,"Mechanotransduction, the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, is a fundamental process underlying essential physiological functions such as touch and pain sensing, hearing, and proprioception. Although the mechanisms for some of these functions have been identified, the molecules essential to the sense of pain have remained elusive. Here we report identification of TACAN (Tmem120A), an ion channel involved in sensing mechanical pain. TACAN is expressed in a subset of nociceptors, and its heterologous expression increases mechanically evoked currents in cell lines. Purification and reconstitution of TACAN in synthetic lipids generates a functional ion channel. Finally, a nociceptor-specific inducible knockout of TACAN decreases the mechanosensitivity of nociceptors and reduces behavioral responses to painful mechanical stimuli but not to thermal or touch stimuli. We propose that TACAN is an ion channel that contributes to sensing mechanical pain."
https://openalex.org/W3007245269,"The dichotomous model of “drivers” and “passengers” in cancer posits that only a few mutations in a tumor strongly affect its progression, with the remaining ones being inconsequential. Here, we leveraged the comprehensive variant dataset from the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project to demonstrate that—in addition to the dichotomy of high- and low-impact variants—there is a third group of medium-impact putative passengers. Moreover, we also found that molecular impact correlates with subclonal architecture (i.e., early versus late mutations), and different signatures encode for mutations with divergent impact. Furthermore, we adapted an additive-effects model from complex-trait studies to show that the aggregated effect of putative passengers, including undetected weak drivers, provides significant additional power (∼12% additive variance) for predicting cancerous phenotypes, beyond PCAWG-identified driver mutations. Finally, this framework allowed us to estimate the frequency of potential weak-driver mutations in PCAWG samples lacking any well-characterized driver alterations."
https://openalex.org/W3007702218,"Safety and efficiency of human-AI collaboration often depend on how humans could appropriately calibrate their trust towards the AI agents. Over-trusting the autonomous system sometimes causes serious safety issues. Although many studies focused on the importance of system transparency in keeping proper trust calibration, the research in detecting and mitigating improper trust calibration remains very limited. To fill these research gaps, we propose a method of adaptive trust calibration that consists of a framework for detecting the inappropriate calibration status by monitoring the user’s reliance behavior and cognitive cues called “trust calibration cues” to prompt the user to reinitiate trust calibration. We evaluated our framework and four types of trust calibration cues in an online experiment using a drone simulator. A total of 116 participants performed pothole inspection tasks by using the drone’s automatic inspection, the reliability of which could fluctuate depending upon the weather conditions. The participants needed to decide whether to rely on automatic inspection or to do the inspection manually. The results showed that adaptively presenting simple cues could significantly promote trust calibration during over-trust."
https://openalex.org/W3006682863,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal emergency that affects ten percent of very low birth weight premature babies and costs society in both expense and heartache. It is probably caused by an inappropriate interaction of colonizing bacteria with an immature intestine. A possible preventative measure is to feed prematures their mother’s expressed breast milk in conjunction with a probiotic. This synbiotic prevention reduces the severity and incidence of this condition. This study was designed to determine the mechanism of the synbiotic effect in human and mouse fetal intestine. Breast milk interacting with a NEC preventative probiotic such as Bifidobacterium infantis can produce increased levels of short chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate and butyrate) (SCFAs). SCFAs are known to be anti-inflammatory in mature enterocytes and immunocytes. Very little is known about their role in immature intestine. When exposed to a human fetal cell line, fetal intestinal organoids and fetal mouse intestine, these SCFAs were anti-inflammatory. Their mechanism of anti-inflammation differed from those reported for mature cells by involving the G-protein coupled receptor (GPR 109A) and inhibiting histone deacetylase 4 and 5. These bacterial metabolites may help explain the synbiotic anti-inflammatory effect of breast milk and probiotics given to premature infants at risk for NEC."
https://openalex.org/W3007176118,"Maintaining multiple items in working memory (WM) is central to human behavior. Persistently active neurons are thought to be a mechanism to maintain WMs, but it remains unclear how such activity is coordinated when multiple items are kept in memory. We show that memoranda-selective persistently active neurons in the human medial temporal lobe phase lock to ongoing slow-frequency (1–7 Hz) oscillations during WM maintenance. The properties of phase locking are dependent on memory content and load. During high memory loads, the phase of the oscillatory activity to which neurons phase lock provides information about memory content not available in the firing rate of the neurons. We provide a computational model that reveals that inhibitory-feedback-mediated competition between multiple persistently active neurons reproduces this phenomenon. This work reveals a mechanism for the active maintenance of multiple items in WM that relies on persistently active neurons whose activation is orchestrated by oscillatory activity."
https://openalex.org/W3007222983,"This study aims to accelerate coronary MRI using a novel reconstruction algorithm, called self-consistent robust artificial-neural-networks for k-space interpolation (sRAKI). sRAKI performs iterative parallel imaging reconstruction by enforcing coil self-consistency using subject-specific neural networks. This approach extends the linear convolutions in SPIRiT to nonlinear interpolation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These CNNs are trained individually for each scan using the scan-specific autocalibrating signal (ACS) data. Reconstruction is performed by imposing the learned self-consistency and data-consistency enabling sRAKI to support random undersampling patterns. Fully-sampled targeted right coronary artery MRI was acquired in six healthy subjects for evaluation. The data were retrospectively undersampled, and reconstructed using SPIRiT, $\ell_1$-SPIRiT and sRAKI for acceleration rates of 2 to 5. Additionally, prospectively undersampled whole-heart coronary MRI was acquired to further evaluate performance. The results indicate that sRAKI reduces noise amplification and blurring artifacts compared with SPIRiT and $\ell_1$-SPIRiT, especially at high acceleration rates in targeted data. Quantitative analysis shows that sRAKI improves normalized mean-squared-error (~44% and ~21% over SPIRiT and $\ell_1$-SPIRiT at rate 5) and vessel sharpness (~10% and ~20% over SPIRiT and $\ell_1$-SPIRiT at rate 5). In addition, whole-heart data shows the sharpest coronary arteries when resolved using sRAKI, with 11% and 15% improvement in vessel sharpness over SPIRiT and $\ell_1$-SPIRiT, respectively. Thus, sRAKI is a database-free neural network-based reconstruction technique that may further accelerate coronary MRI with arbitrary undersampling patterns, while improving noise resilience over linear parallel imaging and image sharpness over $\ell_1$ regularization techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3008146206,"Mucus form H. aspersa muller has been reported to have several therapeutic proprieties, such as antimicrobial activity, skin protection and wound repair. In this study, we have analyzed H. aspersa mucus (Helixcomplex) bio-adhesive efficacy and its defensive properties against the ozone (O3) (0.5 ppm for 2 hours) exposure in human keratinocytes and reconstructed human epidermis models. Cytotoxicity, tissue morphology and cytokine levels were determined. We confirmed HelixComplex regenerative and bio-adhesive properties, the latter possibly via the characteristic mucopolysaccharide composition. In addition, HelixComplex was able to protect from O3 exposure by preventing oxidative damage and the consequent pro-inflammatory response in both 2D and 3D models. Based on this study, it is possible to suggest HelixComplex as a potentially new protective technology against pollution induced skin damage."
https://openalex.org/W3008694505,"The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is administered at birth in tuberculosis (TB) endemic countries. BCG vaccination is also associated with protective non-specific effects against non-tuberculous infections. This seems at least in part mediated through induction of innate immune memory in myeloid cells, a process termed trained immunity. β-glucan, a component of the fungal cell wall from Candida albicans, induces a trained immunity phenotype in human monocytes with hyper-responsiveness against unrelated pathogens. We aimed to study the capacity of BCG and β-glucan to induce a similar phenotype by examining cytokine production in cord blood monocytes following re-stimulation. We used a well-known model of in vitro induction of trained immunity. Adherent mononuclear cells from neonates and adults, which consist mainly of monocytes, were stimulated in vitro with BCG or β-glucan for one day, after which the stimulus was washed away. Cells were rested for 5 days, then restimulated with LPS. Cytokine levels were measured using ELISA. Neonate and adult monocytes responded similarly in terms of cytokine production. BCG significantly increased IL-6 responses to LPS in both neonate and adult monocytes, while β-glucan induced increases of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF production capacity. The BCG and β-glucan induced increase in cytokine production, reminiscent of trained immunity, showed similar levelsin neonatal and adult monocytes. BCG mediated changes in cytokine production shows the feasibility of this in vitro assay for further studies regarding non-specific effects of vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3007766288,"Primary data collected during a research study is often shared and may be reused for new studies. To assess the extent of data sharing in favourable circumstances and whether data sharing checks can be automated, this article investigates summary statistics from primary human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This type of data is highly suitable for sharing because it is a standard research output, is straightforward to use in future studies (e.g., for secondary analysis), and may be already stored in a standard format for internal sharing within multi-site research projects. Manual checks of 1799 articles from 2010 and 2017 matching a simple PubMed query for molecular epidemiology GWAS were used to identify 314 primary human GWAS papers. Of these, only 13% reported the location of a complete set of GWAS summary data, increasing from 3% in 2010 to 23% in 2017. Whilst information about whether data was shared was typically located clearly within a data availability statement, the exact nature of the shared data was usually unspecified. Thus, data sharing is the exception even in suitable research fields with relatively strong data sharing norms. Moreover, the lack of clear data descriptions within data sharing statements greatly complicates the task of automatically characterising shared data sets."
https://openalex.org/W3008042807,"Studies of the gender pay gap are seldom able to simultaneously account for the range of alternative putative mechanisms underlying it. Using CloudResearch, an online microtask platform connecting employers to workers who perform research-related tasks, we examine whether gender pay discrepancies are still evident in a labor market characterized by anonymity, relatively homogeneous work, and flexibility. For 22,271 Mechanical Turk workers who participated in nearly 5 million tasks, we analyze hourly earnings by gender, controlling for key covariates which have been shown previously to lead to differential pay for men and women. On average, women’s hourly earnings were 10.5% lower than men’s. Several factors contributed to the gender pay gap, including the tendency for women to select tasks that have a lower advertised hourly pay. This study provides evidence that gender pay gaps can arise despite the absence of overt discrimination, labor segregation, and inflexible work arrangements, even after experience, education, and other human capital factors are controlled for. Findings highlight the need to examine other possible causes of the gender pay gap. Potential strategies for reducing the pay gap on online labor markets are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3006747692,"Background Globally, alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern and it is one of the most important risk behaviours among university students. Alcohol consumption can lead to poor academic performance, injuries, fights, use of other substances, and risky sexual behaviours among students. However, the study explored the prevalence of alcohol consumption and the associated risk factors among university students since these have not been fully examined in previous research. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of alcohol consumption and the associated risk factors among university students in Myanmar. Methods The present cross-sectional study was conducted using a sample of 15-24-year-old university students who were selected from six universities in Mandalay, Myanmar, in August 2018. In total, 3,456 students (males: 1,301 and females: 2,155) were recruited and asked to respond to a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for alcohol consumption among university students. Results The prevalence of alcohol consumption in the previous 30 days was 20.3% (males: 36.0%, females: 10.8%). The alcohol consumption was significantly higher among males (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI; 1.9–2.9), truant students (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI; 1.3–3.3), smokers (AOR = 7.0, 95% CI; 5.1–9.7), students who reported feeling of hopelessness or sadness (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI; 1.2–1.8), peers’ alcohol consumption (AOR = 7.5, 95% CI; 4.8–11.7). Conclusion The present study revealed that males, smokers, peer alcohol consumption, and truant students had higher odds of alcohol consumption among the students. Therefore, effective campus-based counselling, peer education, and national surveillance systems that can monitor risky drinking behaviours among university students should be implemented. Further, government regulations that control the production, sale, promotion, advertising, and restriction of alcohol should be well developed and strengthened, as in the case of other Southeast Asian countries."
https://openalex.org/W3006709435,"Introduction The application of brief high voltage electrical pulses to tissue can lead to an irreversible or reversible electroporation effect in a cell-specific manner. In the management of ventricular arrhythmias, the ability to target different tissue types, specifically cardiac conduction tissue (His-Purkinje System) vs. cardiac myocardium would be advantageous. We hypothesize that pulsed electric fields (PEFs) can be applied safely to the beating heart through a catheter-based approach, and we tested whether the superficial Purkinje cells can be targeted with PEFs without injury to underlying myocardial tissue. Methods In an acute (n = 5) and chronic canine model (n = 6), detailed electroanatomical mapping of the left ventricle identified electrical signals from myocardial and overlying Purkinje tissue. Electroporation was effected via percutaneous catheter-based Intracardiac bipolar current delivery in the anesthetized animal. Repeat Intracardiac electrical mapping of the heart was performed at acute and chronic time points; followed by histological analysis to assess effects. Results PEF demonstrated an acute dose-dependent functional effect on Purkinje, with titration of pulse duration and/or voltage associated with successful acute Purkinje damage. Electrical conduction in the insulated bundle of His (n = 2) and anterior fascicle bundle (n = 2), was not affected. At 30 days repeat cardiac mapping demonstrated resilient, normal electrical conduction throughout the targeted area with no significant change in myocardial amplitude (pre 5.9 ± 1.8 mV, 30 days 5.4 ± 1.2 mV, p = 0.92). Histopathological analysis confirmed acute Purkinje fiber targeting, with chronic studies showing normal Purkinje fibers, with minimal subendocardial myocardial fibrosis. Conclusion PEF provides a novel, safe method for non-thermal acute modulation of the Purkinje fibers without significant injury to the underlying myocardium. Future optimization of this energy delivery is required to optimize conditions so that selective electroporation can be utilized in humans the treatment of cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W3007332408,"The alpha/beta-Hydrolases (ABH) are a structural class of proteins that are found widespread in nature and includes enzymes that can catalyze various reactions in different substrates. The catalytic versatility of the ABH fold enzymes, which has been a valuable property in protein engineering applications, is based on a similar acid-base-nucleophile catalytic mechanism. In our research, we are concerned with the structure that surrounds the key units of the catalytic machinery, and we have previously found conserved structural organizations that coordinate the catalytic acid, the catalytic nucleophile and the residues of the oxyanion hole. Here, we explore the architecture that surrounds the catalytic histidine at the active sites of enzymes from 40 ABH fold families, where we have identified six conserved interactions that coordinate the catalytic histidine next to the catalytic acid and the catalytic nucleophile. Specifically, the catalytic nucleophile is coordinated next to the catalytic histidine by two weak hydrogen bonds, while the catalytic acid is directly involved in the coordination of the catalytic histidine through by two weak hydrogen bonds. The imidazole ring of the catalytic histidine is coordinated by a CH-π contact and a hydrophobic interaction. Moreover, the catalytic triad residues are connected with a residue that is located at the core of the active site of ABH fold, which is suggested to be the fourth member of a ""structural catalytic tetrad"". Besides their role in the stability of the catalytic mechanism, the conserved elements of the catalytic site are actively involved in ligand binding and affect other properties of the catalytic activity, such as substrate specificity, enantioselectivity, pH optimum and thermostability of ABH fold enzymes. These properties are regularly targeted in protein engineering applications, and thus, the identified conserved structural elements can serve as potential modification sites in order to develop ABH fold enzymes with altered activities."
https://openalex.org/W3007038235,"To measure intervertebral disc (IVD) health parameters in middle-aged long-term runners compared to matched non-physically active controls.Seventeen males aged 44-62yr were included in the study: 9 runners with a running history of >10yr, averaging >50km/week, and eight matched non-physically active controls, the data from one participant had to be excluded. T2-relaxometry, diffusion weighted imaging, T1- and T2-weighted MR scanning, as well as T2 time mapping were performed. Morphological data relating to IVD were extrapolated.Compared to controls on average, runners had 20% greater IVD height (p = 0.002) and seven percentage points greater IVD-vertebral body height ratio (p = 0.001). No significant differences were observed between groups for mean(SD) IVD hydration status, as indicated by similar T2-times (runners: 94.4(11.1)ms, controls: 88.6(23.6)ms), or apparent diffusion coefficients (runners: 249.0(175.2)mm2/s, controls: 202.3(149.5)mm2/s). Average Pfirrmann score for the L5-S1 IVD was 2.2(0.7) for runners and 3.3(1.0) for controls (p = 0.026), average scores for all lumbar levels (L2-S1) were 1.9(0.2) and 2.5(0.7), respectively (p = 0.036). Anterior annulus T2-time and overall average lumbar level Pfirrmann grades were strongly correlated (r = 0.787, p = 0.021 and r = -0.704, p = 0.034, respectively) with greater distances run per week. Average lumbar level Pfirrmann grades were also strongly correlated (r = -0.823, p = 0.006) to total years of running.Middle-aged long-term endurance runners exhibit less age-related decline in their lumbar IVDs. In addition, the measures of IVD morphology appeared to be better in those who had been running for a greater number of years, as well as in those who ran a greater distance per week."
https://openalex.org/W3006828212,"Objective To analyze the pattern and appropriateness of pain medications in older adults receiving home care. Methods We performed a prospective cross-sectional study in patients ≥65 years old having chronic pain and receiving home care in Berlin, Germany. Data on prescribed pain medications were collected using self-reported information, nursing documents, and medication plans during interviews at home. Pain intensity was determined with the numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Pain Assessment In Advanced dementia (PAINAD) scale. The Pain Medication Appropriateness Scale score (SPMAS) was applied to evaluate inappropriateness (i.e. a score ≤67) of pain medication. Results Overall 322 patients with a mean age of 82.1 ± 7.4 years (71.4% females) were evaluated. The average pain intensity scores during the last 24 hours were 5.3 ± 2.1 and 2.3 ± 2.3 on NRS and PAINAD scale (range 0–10, respectively). Sixty (18.6%) patients did not receive any pain medication. Among the treated patients, dipyrone was the most frequently prescribed analgesic (71.4%), while 50.8% and 19.1% received systemic treatment with opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, respectively. The observed median SPMAS was 47.6 (range 0–100) with 58 (18.0%) of patients achieving appropriate values. Half of the patients were treated with scheduled, while 29.9% were only treated with on-demand medications. Cognitive status had no effect on appropriateness of pain treatment. Conclusions We observed substantial deficits in dosing patterns and appropriateness of pain medication in older adults with pain receiving home care. This applied to both patients with and without severe cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3007219188,"One prominent barrier faced by healthcare consumers when accessing health services is a common requirement to complete repetitive, inefficient paper-based documentation at multiple registration sites. Digital innovation has a potential role to reduce the burden in this area, through the collection and sharing of data between healthcare providers. While there is growing evidence for digital innovations to potentially improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health systems, there is less information on the willingness of healthcare consumers to embrace and utilise technology to provide data.The study aims to improve understanding of consumers' preference for utilising a digital health administration mobile app.The online study used a stated preference experiment design to explore aspects of consumers' preference for a mobile health administration app and its impact on the likelihood of using the app. The survey was answered by a representative sample (by age and gender) of Australian adults, and sociodemographic factors were also recorded for analysis. Each participant answered eight choice sets in which a hypothetical app (defined by a set of dimensions and levels) was presented and the respondent was asked if they would be willing to provide data using that app. Analysis was conducted using bivariate logistic regression.For the average respondent, the two most important dimensions were the time it took to register on the app and the electronic governance arrangements around their personal information. Willingness to use any app was found to differ based on respondent characteristics: people with higher education, and women, were relatively more willing to utilise the mobile health app.This study investigated consumers' willingness to utilise a digital health administration mobile app. The identification of key characteristics of more acceptable apps provide valuable insight and recommendations for developers of similar digital health administration technologies. This would increase the likelihood of achieving successful acceptance and utilisation by consumers. The results from this study provide evidence-based recommendations for future research and policy development, planning and implementation of digital health administration mobile applications in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W3007047170,"We aimed to study the physiological effects of diet supplemented with copper (Cu) nanoparticles (NPs). During the eight weeks of the experiment, young Wistar rats (at seven weeks of age, n = 9) were supplemented with 6.5 mg of Cu either as NPs or carbonate salt (Cu6.5). A diet that was not supplemented with Cu served as a negative control (Cu0). The impact of nano Cu supplementation on lipid (reflected as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances-TBARS) and protein peroxidation (thiol and carbonyl groups) in blood plasma as well as the influence on the vasodilatory mechanism(s) of isolated rat thoracic arteries were studied. Supplementation with Cu enhanced lipid peroxidation (TBARS) in NP6.5 (x2.4) and in Cu6.5 (x1.9) compared to the negative control. Significant increase in TBARS was also observed in NP6.5 (x1.3) compared to the Cu6.5 group. The level of thiol groups increased in NP6.5 (x1.6) compared to Cu6.5. Meanwhile, significant (x0.6) decrease was observed in the Cu6.5 group compared to the negative control. Another marker of protein oxidation, carbonyl groups increased in NP6.5 (x1.4) and Cu6.5 (x2.3) compared to the negative control. However significant difference (x0.6) was observed between NP6.5 and Cu6.5. Arteries from Cu supplemented rats exhibited an enhanced vasodilation to gasotransmitters: nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). An enhanced vasodilation to NO was reflected in the increased response to acetylcholine (ACh) and calcium ionophore A23187. The observed responses to ACh and CO releasing molecule (CORM-2) were more pronounced in NP6.5. The activator of cGMP-dependent protein kinases (8-bromo-cGMP) induced similar vasodilation of thoracic arteries in NP6.5 and Cu0 groups, while an increased response was observed in the Cu6.5 group. Preincubation with the inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) synthase inhibitor- 1400W, decreased the ACh-induced vasodilation in NP6.5, exclusively. Meanwhile the eicosanoid metabolite of arachidonic acid (20-HETE) synthesis inhibitor-HET0016, enhanced vasodilation of arteries from Cu0 group. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that supplementation with nano Cu influences oxidative stress, which further has modified the vascular response."
https://openalex.org/W3007257304,"The multi-domain protein UHRF1 is essential for DNA methylation maintenance and binds DNA via a base-flipping mechanism with a preference for hemi-methylated CpG sites. We investigated its binding to hemi- and symmetrically modified DNA containing either 5-methylcytosine (mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), 5-formylcytosine (fC), or 5-carboxylcytosine (caC). Our experimental results indicate that UHRF1 binds symmetrically carboxylated and hybrid methylated/carboxylated CpG dyads in addition to its previously reported substrates. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations provide a possible mechanistic explanation of how the protein could differentiate between modification patterns. First, we observe different local binding modes in the nucleotide binding pocket as well as the protein’s NKR finger. Second, both DNA modification sites are coupled through key residues within the NKR finger, suggesting a communication pathway affecting protein-DNA binding for carboxylcytosine modifications. Our results suggest a possible additional function of the hemi-methylation reader UHRF1 through binding of carboxylated CpG sites. This opens the possibility of new biological roles of UHRF1 beyond DNA methylation maintenance and of oxidised methylcytosine derivates in epigenetic regulation."

Less attention was paid to discovering the correlation rules among various parent ship deficiencies and subcategories. To address the issue, we proposed an improved Apriori model to explore the intrinsic mutual correlations among the ship deficiencies from the PSC inspection dataset. Four typical ship property indicators (i.e., ship type, age, deadweight and gross tonnage) were introduced to analyze the correlations for the ship parent deficiency categories and subcategories. The findings of our research can provide basic guidelines for PSC inspections to improve the ship inspection efficiency and maritime safety."
https://openalex.org/W3007637561,"The capability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus to form biofilm on varying CI component materials differs in the presence and absence of bioactive glass (BAG). The application of BAG induces significant changes in biofilm morphology which can be visualized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacterial biofilm formation on medical devices, such as cochlear implants (CI), can lead to chronic infections. Interestingly, BAG of type S53P4 seems to be a promising tool for use in the reduction of biofilm development. Primarily, four bacterial species known to cause implant-related infections, P.aeruginosa (ATCC9027), S. aureus (ATCC6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC12228) and Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC19615) were analyzed regarding their capacity to form biofilm on CI components manufactured from three kinds of material: silicone, platinum and titanium. Subsequently, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms were visualized using scanning electron microscopy, comparing BAG-treated biofilm with non-treated biofilm. The four bacterial species presented biofilm-forming capabilities in a species and surface dependent manner. Metal CI components allowed for the greatest proliferation of biofilm. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa showed the highest rate of biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces. For both species, SEM revealed altered biofilm morphology after treatment of S53P4 BAG. This study indicates that bacterial biofilm formation and structure on CI components is dependent on the surface composition, altering between metal and silicone surfaces. After application of BAG, changes in biofilm morphology on CI components were observed. These data highlight the impact of BAG on bacterial biofilm morphology."
https://openalex.org/W3007675917,"Introduction and purpose The purpose was to analyze socioeconomic and clinical factors of psychosocial functioning and self-perception in relation to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with severe mental health illness (SMI) by gender. Materials and method A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 133 women and 90 men. Recorded variables: HRQOL, SF-36 Physical Component Scores (PCS) and Mental Component Scores (MCS); sociodemographic and clinical data on psychosocial and self-perception functioning. Correlational studies using raw and adjusted linear regression models to evaluate the factors associated with HRQOL by obtaining coefficients, p-values and respective confidence intervals. Results The mean PCS for women and men was 44.6 and 49.0 (p = 0.004) and 36.4 and 37.5 (p = 0.575), respectively for MCS. The factors associated with PCS in women were age, -0.2(-0.4:0); in work, 4.2(0.3:8.2); with an income higher than 700 euros/month, 4.4(1:7.7). In men, these factors were education level, 6.1(0.4:11.7); belief that they would not need help in the future, 4.6(0.1:9.2) and a higher need for psychosocial services, -6.6(-11.1:-2). Factors associated with MCS in women were, in work, 6.1(1.5:10.7); and having a high number of friends, 6.6(2.1:11.1). In men, these factors were, living alone, -7.1(-12.7:-1.4); lack of economic benefits, 8.5(3.2:13.8); and a higher need for psychosocial and social services, -3.6(-7.1:-0.2) and -7.7(-13.4:-2). Conclusions The dimensions affected and the factors that are associated with HRQOL for people with SMI differ by gender. Therefore, these differences should to be taken into account when designing interventions for improving HRQOL."
https://openalex.org/W3007634778,"Biomolecular self-assembly is an emerging bottom-up approach for the synthesis of novel nanomaterials. DNA and viruses have both been used to create scaffolds but the former lacks chemical diversity and the latter lack spatial control. To date, the use of protein scaffolds to template materials on the nanoscale has focused on amyloidogenic proteins that are known to form fibrils or two-protein systems where a second protein acts as a cross-linker. We previously developed a unique approach for self-assembly of nanomaterials based on engineering β-solenoid proteins (BSPs) to polymerize into micrometer-length fibrils. BSPs have highly regular geometries, tunable lengths, and flat surfaces that are amenable to engineering and functionalization. Here, we present a newly engineered BSP based on the antifreeze protein of the beetle Rhagium inquisitor (RiAFP-m9), which polymerizes into stable fibrils under benign conditions. Gold nanoparticles were used to functionalize the RiAFP-m9 fibrils as well as those assembled from the previously described SBAFP-m1 protein. Cysteines incorporated into the sequences provide site-specific gold attachment. Additionally, silver was deposited on the gold-labelled fibrils by electroless plating to create nanowires. These results bolster prospects for programable self-assembly of BSPs to create scaffolds for functional nanomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W3007914240,"Catecholamines have long been associated with cognitive control and value-based decision-making. More recently, we have shown that catecholamines also modulate value-based decision-making about whether or not to engage in cognitive control. Yet it is unclear whether catecholamines influence these decisions by altering the subjective value of control. Thus, we tested whether tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor altered the subjective value of performing a demanding working memory task among healthy older adults (60–75 years). Contrary to our prediction, tyrosine administration did not significantly increase the subjective value of conducting an N-back task for reward, as a main effect. Instead, in line with our previous study, exploratory analyses indicated that drug effects varied as a function of participants’ trait impulsivity scores. Specifically, tyrosine increased the subjective value of conducting an N-back task in low impulsive participants, while reducing its value in more impulsive participants. One implication of these findings is that the over-the-counter tyrosine supplements may be accompanied by an undermining effect on the motivation to perform demanding cognitive tasks, at least in certain older adults. Taken together, these findings indicate that catecholamines can alter cognitive control by modulating motivation (rather than just the ability) to exert cognitive control."
https://openalex.org/W3008218629,"Natriuretic peptides are cardiac-derived hormones that enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation. Low natriuretic peptide levels are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2); a condition with variable prevalence across racial/ethnic groups. Few studies have examined whether circulating natriuretic peptide levels and their response to preventive interventions for DM2 differ by race/ethnicity. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a clinical trial (July 31, 1996- July 31, 2001) that randomized participants to preventive interventions for DM2. Using stored serum samples, we examined N-terminus pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in 3,220 individuals (56% white; 19% African-American; 15% Hispanic; 5% American-Indian; 5% Asian). The influence of race/ethnicity on NT-proBNP concentrations at baseline and after two years of treatment with placebo, lifestyle, or metformin was examined with multivariable-adjusted regression. At baseline, NT-proBNP differed significantly by race (P < .001), with the lowest values in African-American individuals. Hispanic individuals also had lower baseline NT-proBNP levels compared with whites (P< .001), while NT-proBNP levels were similar between white, American-Indian, and Asian individuals. At two years of follow-up, NT-proBNP levels decreased in African-Americans in each of the DPP study arms, whereas they were stable or increased in the other racial/ethnic groups. In the DPP, African-American individuals had lower circulating NT-proBNP levels compared with individuals in other racial/ethnic groups at baseline and after two years of preventive interventions. Further studies should examine the cardio-metabolic implications of lower natriuretic peptide levels in African-Americans. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00004992."
https://openalex.org/W3008356663,"Background Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) limits its subsequent use, resulting in poor cancer prognosis. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been reported to attenuate cisplatin-induced AKI in animal models, but the effect in human patients remains to be clarified. We hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibitors can prevent cisplatin-induced AKI in diabetic-cancer patients. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive cancer patients who were treated with a first cycle of cisplatin-containing regimen between January 2011 and October 2019. We analysed data of diabetic-cancer patients treated with high-dose cisplatin (> 50 mg/m2)-containing regimens. The change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within 2 weeks after cisplatin treatment was compared between the patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors and those treated without DPP-4 inhibitors. Results A total of 455 patients were treated with cisplatin during the period. Of these, 34 patients were eligible for the analysis. The change of eGFR was significantly less in the patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors, compared to those without DPP-4 inhibitors [the percentages of eGFR decline (mean ± SD) was 23.6 ± 20.3% vs 43.1± 20.1%, respectively; P = 0.010]. Furthermore, the incidence of AKI was significantly less in the patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors (25% vs 64%, respectively; P = 0.026). Conclusions DPP-4 inhibitors may decrease the risk of cisplatin-induced AKI in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3008693132,"Although Ancient Egyptians mummified millions of animals over the course of one millennium, many details of these mummification protocols remain unknown. Multi-scale propagation phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography was used to visualise an ancient Egyptian crocodile mummy housed at the Musée des Confluences (Lyon, France). This state-of-the-art non-destructive imaging technique revealed the complete interior anatomy of the mummy in three dimensions. Here, we present detailed insight into the complex post-mortem treatment of a decaying crocodile cadaver in preparation for mummification. Except for the head and the extremities of the limbs, everything beneath the skin of the crocodile (i.e. organs, muscles, and even most of the skeleton) was removed to cease further putrefaction. This unexpected finding demonstrates that earlier knowledge obtained from textual and other archaeological sources does not sufficiently reflect the diversity of mummification protocols implemented by Ancient Egyptians."
https://openalex.org/W3006873235,"Cigarette smoke (CS) contains multiple gaseous and particulate materials that can cause lung inflammation, and smoking is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to determine the mechanisms of how CS triggers lung inflammation. Nur77, a nuclear hormone receptor belonging to the immediate-early response gene family, controls inflammatory responses, mainly by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway. Because it is unknown if Nur77's anti-inflammatory role modulates COPD, we assessed if and how Nur77 expression and activity are altered in CS-induced airway inflammation. In lung tissues and bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients, we found Nur77 was downregulated. In a murine model of CS-induced airway inflammation, CS promoted lung inflammation and also reduced Nur77 activity in wild type (WT) mice, whereas lungs of Nur77-deficient mice showed exaggerated CS-induced inflammatory responses. Our findings in in vitro studies of human airway epithelial cells complemented those in vivo data in mice, together showing that CS induced threonine-phosphorylation of Nur77, which is known to interfere with its anti-inflammatory functions. In summary, our findings point to Nur77 as an important regulator of CS-induced inflammatory responses and support the potential benefits of Nur77 activation for COPD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3006965912,"Treatment of transplant-ineligible (TNE) newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) requires a balance between disease control and maintaining quality of life (QoL). Patients value treatment-free remission periods in this incurable condition, as they are associated with better QoL. We set out to study clinical outcomes of consecutive TNE NDMM patients in routine care treated in Thames Valley Cancer Network between 2009 and 2017. The primary outcome was the evaluation of the treatment-free interval (TFI) after 1st and subsequent lines of therapy in the total cohort and in individual subgroups, according to age (≤75 vs. >75 years), and co-morbidities using Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI): mild: 0–2 vs. moderate: 3–4 vs. severe: ≥5). Secondary outcomes include response rates, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between subgroups: according to age and according to co-morbidities. In a total cohort of 292 patients, median TFI (IQR) was longest after first-line therapy 6.9 months (1.4–16.9), reducing after second line therapy to 1.8 months (.7–6.9), and after third line therapy to 0.6 months (0.2–1.5). Median TFI followed the same trend across the different subgroups, by age (≤75, >75 years) and by CCI (0–2, 3–4, ≥5). Overall response rate (ORR) to first line therapy for total cohort was 67%, with responses categorised as complete response (CR): 21%, very good partial response: 16%, partial response: 30%, stable disease: 18%, and progressive disease: 8%. ORR in individual subgroups by age were (≤75: 70% vs. >75: 63%), and by CCI (0–2: 65% vs. 3–4: 71% vs. ≥5: 77%). Median OS and PFS for the total cohort were (30.2 months, 95% CI: 23.8–36.9), and (9 months, 95% CI: 7.9–9.8), respectively. Patients aged >75 years showed a significant reduction in OS and PFS compared to those ≤75 years of age: OS (49.0 vs. 22.4 months, p<0.0001, HR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.5–2.8), PFS (9.7 vs. 8.0 months, p<0.01, HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.1–1.9). Median OS was significantly reduced with worsening co-morbidities: (CCI 0–2: 52.4 months vs. CCI 3–4: 33.0 months vs. CCI ≥5: 24.0 months, p = 0.01, HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.1–1.9). Median PFS was significantly reduced in the severely co-morbid subgroup (CCI 0–2: 9.4 months vs. CCI 3–4: 9.6 months vs. CCI ≥5: 7.1 months, p = 0.025, HR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0–1.6). This study demonstrated that first line therapy in the TNE NDMM setting resulted in the longest TFI which was modest at a median of 6.9 months, and decreased significantly following subsequent lines of therapy and across the different subgroups by age and by co-morbidities. Therapy objective should be to maximise the benefit of first line treatment. We envisage that the recent shift towards a continuous therapeutic approach will benefit TNE patients in view of improved survival data demonstrated by a number phase 3 trials. When continuous therapy is not appropriate due to patient choice or toxicities, an efficacious (not limited to thalidomide and bortezomib) but tolerable first line FDT strategy, which can maximise TFI and maintain a good QoL, remains a reasonable alternative approach."
https://openalex.org/W3007778688,"Regression testing is crucial in ensuring that modifications made did not introduce any adverse effect on the software being modified. However, regression testing suffers from execution cost and time consumption problems. Test case prioritization (TCP) is one of the techniques used to overcome these issues by re-ordering test cases based on their priorities. Model-based TCP (MB-TCP) is an approach in TCP where the software models are manipulated to perform prioritization. The issue with MB-TCP is that most of the existing approaches do not provide satisfactory faults detection capability. Besides, their granularity of test selection criteria is not very good and this can affect prioritization effectiveness. This study proposes an MB-TCP approach that can improve the faults detection performance of regression testing. It combines the implementation of two existing approaches from the literature while incorporating an additional ordering criterion to boost prioritization efficacy. A detailed empirical study is conducted with the aim to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed approach with the selected existing approaches from the literature using the average of the percentage of faults detected (APFD) metric. Three web applications were used as the objects of study to obtain the required test suites that contained the tests to be prioritized. From the result obtained, the proposed approach yields the highest APFD values over other existing approaches which are 91%, 86% and 91% respectively for the three web applications. These higher APFD values signify that the proposed approach is very effective in revealing faults early during testing. They also show that the proposed approach can improve the faults detection performance of regression testing."
https://openalex.org/W3008604585,"Taxonomists always have had intense discussions about how species should be delimited and recently many studies have used integrative approaches by combining molecular, morphological, and bioacoustic data. Although these studies are paramount for understanding species diversity, few of them actually formalize species delimitations to the final step of nomenclatural acts. Historically, the Neotropical frog genus Adenomera has been considered as a difficult taxonomic group because it comprises many morphologically similar species exhibiting high levels of intraspecific polymorphism. A recent work using molecular data shed light on the phylogenetic relationships within the genus and identified several lineages that may correspond to undescribed species but did not delimit species boundaries. In the Atlantic Forest, a clade formed by A. marmorata and two putative species (Adenomera sp. J and Adenomera sp. K) were identified. In this paper, we combine morphological, acoustic, and molecular data in order to evaluate species limits within this Atlantic Forest Adenomera clade. We provide a redescription of A. marmorata and restrict its type locality to the Tijuca Massif, in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results do not support A. marmorata and the two candidate species as diagnosable distinct species. Therefore A. marmorata corresponds to a species with pronounced morphological and acoustic variation in the genus and a complex phylogeographic structure."

This study was aimed to evaluate the associations of genome-wide single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) with the liver enzymes in a Korean population.We performed a GWAS to identify genetic loci influencing liver function, as measured by concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and total bilirubin (BIL) in in Korean study participants.A total of 6,488 subjects (4,457 in the discovery and 2,031 in the validation set) were included. The mean subject age was 50.0±10.6 years (male, 53.7%). Among a total of 546,738 SNPs tested, rs651007 and rs579459 located in the ABO gene showed strong associations with ALP (P = 1.63×10-8 and 5.61×10-8, respectively [discovery set]; P = 4.08×10-15 and 9.92×10-16, respectively [validation set]). Additionally, rs5751901 and rs2006092, which are located in the GGT1 gene, showed strong associations with GGT (P = 6.44×10-15 and 1.26×10-15, respectively [discovery set]; P = 4.13×10-10 and 5.15×10-11, respectively [validation set]). Among the 13 SNPs that showed genome-wide significance with total bilirubin levels, rs10929302 and rs6742078 showed the most significant association (P = 3.08×10-64 and 2.05×10-62, respectively [discovery set]; P = 1.33×10-116 and 2.24×10-118, respectively [validation set]). No genome-wide significant associations was found for ALT.We demonstrated that ABO, GGT1 and UGT1A family were associated with ALP, GGT and BIL, respectively in Korean population. These findings differ from reported results in GWAS in European populations in terms of associated genes and locations, suggesting different genetic mechanisms of liver enzyme regulation according to ethnicity."
https://openalex.org/W3008699132,"The ability of Streptococcus gordonii to cope with oxidative stress is important for survival and persistence in dental plaque. In this study, we used mutational, phenotypic, and biochemical approaches to characterize the role of a methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrAB) and proteins encoded by genes in the msrAB operon and an adjacent operon in oxidative stress tolerance in S. gordonii. The results showed that MsrAB and four other proteins encoded in the operons are needed for protection from H2O2 and methionine sulfoxide. These five proteins formed a reducing pathway that was needed for oxidative stress tolerance, biofilm formation, and oral colonization in mice. In the pathway, MsrAB was the enzyme that repaired oxidatively damaged proteins, and the two thioredoxin-like lipoproteins (SdbB and Sgo_1177) and two CcdA proteins were proteins that maintained the catalytic cycle of MsrAB. Consistent with the role in oxidative stress tolerance, the production of MsrAB, SdbB, and Sgo_11777 was induced in aerobic growth and planktonic cells."
https://openalex.org/W3007211106,"The Atacama Desert (21–26°S) is currently one of the driest places on Earth and metal(loid)s are of special concern for this region, which hosts the largest-known porphyry copper deposits produced in Chile. Evidence of past environmental conditions is commonly preserved in natural archives, such as lacustrine sediments. Sediment records obtained from Inca Coya Lake (22°20’S-68°35’W, 2534 m.a.s.l.), a small lake located in the Atacama Desert, reflected the evolution of regional mining activity during the 20th century and sedimentation associated with decadal climate variability. We studied the aquatic community structure changes recorded in sediment records from Inca Coya Lake. By analysis of magnetic properties (susceptibility, hysteresis curves and Curie temperatures), grain size and geochemical composition of the sediments, we identified environmental periods and changes in the community of benthic and planktonic organisms (diatoms and diapausing egg bank). We identified three detrital episodes that we interpret as dry/wet phases during the last 90 years associated with the increase of flash flood events promoting hypoxia oscillations; anthropogenic (mining activity) signals were also identified. Invertebrate community structure (primary consumers) reflected the metal exposure, measured as changes in assemblage composition through species turnover. Diatom community composition was best associated with variables related to wetter/drier alternation and consequent changes in oxygen availability. Bioindicators analyzed (diatoms, diapausing egg bank and invertebrate community) demonstrated to be excellent indicators of the bioavailability of compounds in the aquatic ecosystem of Inca Coya Lake, allowing the environmental impact assessment of the water resources due to flash floods and mining activity in the driest desert of the world."
https://openalex.org/W3008139031,"Background Barriers and motives towards physical activity (PA) in lung transplant (LTx) recipients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are largely unknown. We aimed to explore perceptions towards PA in LTx recipients with CF to better understand individuals’ needs and preferences. Methods Participants completed an online survey at two Swiss LTx and one follow-up shared care centre between June and December 2018. Results One hundred and eleven individuals completed the survey (87.4% response rate). Overall, survey participants perceive PA as important for their daily life and health. Perceived motives of PA were improving muscle strength, endurance and quality of life (QoL), to feel better, fun, to achieve personal goals and having more energy for everyday life. Fatigue was the most common perceived barrier to PA and associated with poorer QoL (r = -0.43, p<0.001) and health status (r = -0.31, p = 0.001). Participants with lung allograft dysfunction (LAD, n = 20) reported lower habitual PA (p = 0.009) and health status (p = 0.011), and rated shortness of breath, bad weather and concerns regarding lung rejection higher than those without LAD (all p<0.05). When we asked how an optimal training programme should look like, the majority would prefer individual, non-supervised (60%), outdoor (77%), endurance training (90%), once or twice a week (47%) for 40–60 minutes (48%). Only a minority of patients (14%) would be willing to use exercise applications for their home-based training. Conclusions LTx recipients with CF value PA as important for their health. People with CF should be encouraged individually by their multidisciplinary transplant team to implement PA in their daily life, potential barriers should be identified and addressed. Overall, knowledge on perceived barriers and motives for PA should be considered in the development of future patient-centred PA programmes."
https://openalex.org/W3008468369,"Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are characterized by localized dilation or ballooning of a cerebral artery. When IAs rupture, blood leaks into the space around the brain to create a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The latter is associated with a higher risk of disability and mortality. The aims of this study were to gain greater insight into the pathogenesis of ruptured IAs, and to clarify whether identified hub genes represent potential biological markers for assessing the likelihood of IA progression and rupture. Briefly, the GSE36791 and GSE73378 datasets from the National Center of Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database were reanalyzed and subjected to a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to test the association between gene sets and clinical features. The clinical significance of these genes as potential biomarkers was also examined, with their expression validated by quantitative real-time PCR. A total of 14 co-expression modules and 238 hub genes were identified. In particular, three modules (labeled turquoise, blue, and brown) were found to highly correlate with IA rupture events. Additionally, six potential biomarkers were identified (BASP1, CEBPB, ECHDC2, GZMK, KLHL3, and SLC2A3), which are strongly associated with the progression and rupture of IAs. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into potential molecular mechanisms responsible for IAs and they highlight the potential for these particular genes to serve as biomarkers for monitoring IA rupture."

Methods This retrospective matched cohort study assessed clinical and economic outcomes of adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who were admitted to one of 78 acute care hospitals in the United States with nonduplicate C-NS and carbapenem-susceptible (C-S) isolates from a respiratory source. A subset analysis of patients with principal diagnosis codes denoting bacterial pneumonia or other diagnoses was also conducted. Isolates were classified as community- or hospital-onset based on collection time. A generalized linear mixed model method was used to estimate the attributable burden for mortality, 30-day readmission, length of stay (LOS), cost, and net gain/loss (payment minus cost) using propensity score-matched C-NS versus C-S cohorts. Results For C-NS cases, mortality (25.7%), LOS (29.4 days), and costs ($81,574) were highest in the other principal diagnosis, hospital-onset subgroup; readmissions (19.4%) and net loss (-$9522) were greatest in the bacterial pneumonia, hospital-onset subgroup. Mortality and readmissions were not significantly higher for C-NS cases in any propensity score-matched subgroup. Significant C-NS–attributable burden was found for both other principal diagnosis subgroups for LOS (hospital-onset: 3.7 days, P = 0.006; community-onset: 1.5 days, P<0.001) and cost (hospital-onset: $12,777, P<0.01; community-onset: $2681, P<0.001). Conclusions Increased LOS and cost burden were observed in propensity score-matched patients with C-NS compared with C-S respiratory infections; the C-NS–attributable burden was significant only for patients with other principal diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W3008713903,"Background The Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales—Revised (TAPES-R) is a self-administered questionnaire to measure multidimensional adjustment to a prosthetic limb. Our aim was to assess the validity and reliability of the French version of the TAPES-R (TAPES-R-F). Materials and methods The cross-cultural adaptation was performed according to the recommendations. Factor analysis and Rasch analysis were also performed to allow comparison with the original English version. Construct validity was assessed by measuring the correlations between TAPES-R-F subscores and quality of life, pain, body image satisfaction, anxiety and depression. Internal consistency was measured with Cronbach’s α. The standard error of measurement, smallest detectable change, Bland and Altman limits of agreement, and intraclass correlation were the measures of agreement and reliability. Results No major difficulties were encountered throughout the trans-cultural adaptation process. The final version of the TAPES-R-F was well accepted and understood by the patients. According to the factor analysis, the satisfaction scale should be treated as a one-dimensional construct when used by French-speaking people and should not be separated into two separate subscales, functional and aesthetic, as is the case in the original English version. Our study confirmed that there is a strong relationship between biopsychosocial factors and adjustment to amputation. Cronbach’s α > 0.8 for all the subscales. Reliability was good to excellent for all the subscales (ICCs between 0.61 and 0.89). The smallest detectable changes were 0.7, 0.8, 1.3, 0.4, and 1.8 (general adjustment, social adjustment, adjustment to limitation, activity restriction, and global satisfaction with the prosthesis). Conclusions The TAPES-R-F is a valid and reliable instrument to assess multidimensional adjustment of French-speaking lower limb amputees. This questionnaire can be used for both clinical assessment and research purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3007205524,"Pallets are the most common equipment for transporting and storing goods. More and more companies are willing to rent pallets. Pallet rental companies need to transport pallets from their pallet rental service stations to customers and take these pallets back when they are unloaded. Hence, managers should scientifically configure vehicles for their pallet rental service stations. The fleet size, which indicates the amount and types of vehicles, can significantly affect the efficiency and costs of empty pallet allocation. Therefore, an optimization model for fleet sizing and empty pallet allocation is proposed using the methods of mixed-integer programming and stochastic programming. The objectives of this model are to maximize the profits of pallet rental companies and minimize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from vehicles. A particle swarm optimization algorithm with inertia weight (IPSO) is developed to solve the proposed model because IPSO can avoid becoming trapped in local optima and is able to find a globally optimal solution within a reasonable number of iterations. A numerical example proves the effectiveness of the proposed model and IPSO. The results of numerical tests show that the amount of CO2 emissions from vehicles can affect the decision on fleet sizing and empty pallet allocation. However, if the price, rental fees, or idle costs of the vehicles with low CO2 emissions are too high, managers would not choose them."
https://openalex.org/W3007446949,"Introduction Heel pricks are performed on newborns for diagnostic screenings of various pre-symptomatic metabolic and genetic diseases. Excess blood is spotted on Guthrie cards and archived by many states in biobanks for follow-up diagnoses and public health research. However, storage environment may vary across biobanks and across time within biobanks. With increased applications of DNA extracted from spots for genetic studies, identifying factors associated with genotyping success is critical to maximize DNA quality for future studies. Method We evaluated 399 blood spots, which were part of a genome-wide association study of childhood leukemia risk in children with Down syndrome, archived at the Michigan Neonatal Biobank between 1992 and 2008. High quality DNA was defined as having post-quality control call rate ≥ 99.0% based on the Illumina GenomeStudio 2.0 GenCall algorithm after processing the samples on the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array. Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to evaluate effects of storage environment and storage duration on DNA genotyping quality. Results Both storage environment and duration were associated with sample genotyping call rates (p-values < 0.001). Sample call rates were associated with storage duration independent of storage environment (p-trend = 0.006 for DBS archived in an uncontrolled environment and p-trend = 0.002 in a controlled environment). However, 95% of the total sample had high genotyping quality with a call rate ≥ 95.0%, a standard threshold for acceptable sample quality in many genetic studies. Conclusion Blood spot DNA quality was lower in samples archived in uncontrolled storage environments and for samples archived for longer durations. Still, regardless of storage environment or duration, neonatal biobanks including the Michigan Neonatal Biobanks can provide access to large collections of spots with DNA quality acceptable for most genotyping studies."

We have developed a mouse model of depression/anxiety in mice deficient in the St3gal4 gene. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of urinary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in St3gal4-deficient (St3gal4-KO) and wild-type mice using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and we screened 18 putative VOCs. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on these VOCs identified a major group of 11 VOCs, from which two groups were clarified by hierarchical clustering analysis. One group including six VOCs (pentanoic acid, 4-methyl-, ethyl ester; 3-heptanone, 6-methyl; benzaldehyde; 5,9-undecadien-2-ol, 6,10-dimethyl; and unknown compounds RI1291 and RI1237) was correlated with the startle response (r = 0.620), which is related to an unconscious defensive response. The other group including two VOCs (beta-farnesene and alpha-farnesene) comprised pheromones which increased in KO mice. Next, male mice underwent a social behavior test with female mice in the estrus stage, showing reduced access of KO male mice to female mice. Comparative analysis of urinary VOCs before and after encounters revealed that the six VOCs were not changed by these encounters. However, in WT mice, the two farnesenes increased after the encounters, reaching the level observed in KO mice, which was not altered following the encounter. Taken together, these results indicated that St3gal4 was involved in modulating urinary VOCs. Moreover, VOC clusters discovered by comparison of St3gal4-KO mice with WT mice were correlated with differential emotional behaviors."

There is a paucity of physiological studies evaluating the effect of KT on cutaneous blood microcirculation. Objectives The purpose of this parallel-group controlled laboratory repeated measures design study was to evaluate the effects of KT on cutaneous blood microcirculation in healthy human adults using a dual wavelength (infrared and visible-red) laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) system. KT was compared with rigid taping and no taping controls to isolate the effects associated with the elasticity of KT Methods Forty-five healthy male and female human adults were allocated to one of the three interventions using constrained randomisation following the pre-intervention measurement: (i) KT (ii) ST (standard taping) (iii) NT (no taping). Cutaneous blood perfusion was measured using LDI in the ventral surface of forearm at pre-intervention, during-intervention and post-intervention in a normothermic environment at resting conditions. Results Mixed ANOVA of both infrared and visible-red datasets revealed no statistically significant interaction between Intervention and Time. There was statistically significant main effect for Time but not Intervention. Conclusion KT does not increase cutaneous blood microcirculation in healthy human adults under resting physiological conditions in a normothermic environment. On the contrary, evidence suggests that taping, regardless of the elasticity in the tape, is associated with immediate reductions in cutaneous blood flow."

To improve on the therapeutic efficacy we have combined tTF-NGR with radiotherapy. Methods Serum-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human HT1080 sarcoma cells were irradiated in vitro, and upregulated early-apoptotic phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface was measured by standard flow cytometry. Increase of cellular procoagulant function in relation to irradiation and PS cell surface concentration was measured in a tTF-NGR-dependent Factor X activation assay. In vivo experiments with CD-1 athymic mice bearing human HT1080 sarcoma xenotransplants were performed to test the systemic therapeutic effects of tTF-NGR on tumor growth alone or in combination with regional tumor ionizing radiotherapy. Results As shown by flow cytometry with HUVEC and HT1080 sarcoma cells in vitro, irradiation with 4 and 6 Gy in the process of apoptosis induced upregulation of PS presence on the outer surface of both cell types. Proapoptotic HUVEC and HT1080 cells both showed significantly higher procoagulant efficacy on the basis of equimolar concentrations of tTF-NGR as measured by FX activation. This effect can be reverted by masking of PS with Annexin V. HT1080 human sarcoma xenografted tumors showed shrinkage induced by combined regional radiotherapy and systemic tTF-NGR as compared to growth inhibition achieved by either of the treatment modalities alone. Conclusions Irradiation renders tumor and tumor vascular cells procoagulant by PS upregulation on their outer surface and radiotherapy can significantly improve the therapeutic antitumor efficacy of tTF-NGR in the xenograft model used. This synergistic effect will influence design of future clinical combination studies."
https://openalex.org/W3008051617,"Prenatal hypoxia is a gestational stressor that can result in developmental abnormalities or physiological reprogramming, and often decreases cellular capacity against secondary stress. When a developing fetus is exposed to hypoxia, blood flow is preferentially redirected to vital organs including the brain and heart over other organs including the kidney. Hypoxia-induced injury can lead to structural malformations in the kidney; however, even in the absence of structural lesions, hypoxia can physiologically reprogram the kidney leading to decreased function or increased susceptibility to injury. Our investigation in mice reveals that while prenatal hypoxia does not affect normal development of the kidneys, it primes the kidneys to have an increased susceptibility to kidney injury later in life. We found that our model does not develop structural abnormalities when prenatally exposed to modest 12% O2 as evident by normal histological characterization and gene expression analysis. Further, adult renal structure and function is comparable to mice exposed to ambient oxygen throughout nephrogenesis. However, after induction of kidney injury with a nephrotoxin (cisplatin), the offspring of mice housed in hypoxia exhibit significantly reduced renal function and proximal tubule damage following injury. We conclude that exposure to prenatal hypoxia in utero physiologically reprograms the kidneys leading to increased susceptibility to injury later in life."

Anaplasmosis outbreaks in endemic areas are prevented via vaccination with live A. centrale produced in splenectomized calves. Since A. centrale live vaccine can carry other pathogens and cause disease in adult cattle, research efforts are directed to develop safe recombinant subunit vaccines. Previous work found that the subdominant proteins of A. marginale type IV secretion system (T4SS) and the subdominant elongation factor-Tu (Ef-Tu) were involved in the protective immunity against the experimental challenge in cattle immunized with the A. marginale outer membrane (OM). This study evaluated the immunogenicity and protection conferred by recombinant VirB9.1, VirB9.2, VirB10, VirB11, and Ef-Tu proteins cloned and expressed in E. coli. Twenty steers were randomly clustered into four groups (G) of five animals each. Cattle from G1 and G2 were immunized with a mixture of 50 μg of each recombinant protein with Quil A® or Montanide™ adjuvants, respectively. Cattle from G3 and G4 (controls) were immunized with Quil A and Montanide adjuvants, respectively. Cattle received four immunizations at three-week intervals and were challenged with 107 A. marginale-parasitized erythrocytes 42 days after the fourth immunization. After challenge, all cattle showed clinical signs, with a significant drop of packed cell volume and a significant increase of parasitized erythrocytes (p<0.05), requiring treatment with oxytetracycline to prevent death. The levels of IgG2 induced in the immunized groups did not correlate with the observed lack of protection. Additional strategies are required to evaluate the role of these proteins and their potential utility in the development of effective vaccines."

Here we show early and random PCR errors are a principal source of NGS noise that persist despite duplex molecular barcoding, removal of artifacts due to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, and suppression of patterned errors. We also demonstrate sample duplicates are necessary to eliminate the stochastic noise associated with NGS. Integration of sample duplicates into NGS analytics may broaden ctDNA applications by removing NGS-related errors that confound identification of true very low frequency variants during searches for ctDNA without a priori knowledge of specific mutations to target."
https://openalex.org/W3009036462,"Orthographic processing is crucial in reading. For the Chinese language, sub-lexical processing has already taken place at radical level. Previous literature reported early position-specific radical representations and later position-general radical representations, implying a possible separating process of abstract position information irrespective of radicals per se from radical representations during orthographic processing. However, it remains largely unclear whether the abstract pattern of spatial arrangement of radicals can be rapidly extracted, and if so, whether this extraction takes place at the visual cortex, the very first processing center. As the visual cortex is documented to actively participate in orthographic processing, it may also play a role in the possible extraction of abstract orthographic patterns of Chinese characters. Hence, we hypothesize that abstract orthographic patterns of Chinese characters are covertly extracted at the visual cortex during reading. In this study, we investigated whether the visual cortex could rapidly extract abstract structural patterns of Chinese characters, using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. We adopted an active oddball paradigm with two types of deviant stimuli different only in one feature, structural or tonal, from standard stimuli; in each of the two sessions, subjects focused conscious attention on one feature and neglected the other. We observed that the ERPs recorded at occipital electrodes responded differentially to standard and structural deviant stimuli in both sessions, especially within the time range of the occipital P200 component. Then, we extracted three source waves arising from different levels of the visual cortex. Early response differences (from 88 to 456 ms after stimulus onset) were observed between the source waves, probably arising from left primary/secondary and bilateral associative visual cortices, in response to standard and deviant stimuli that violated abstract structural patterns, whether subjects focused their attention on the character structure or not. This suggests rapid extraction of abstract structural patterns of Chinese characters in the visual cortex, no matter the abstract structural pattern was explicit or implicit to subjects. Note that the source waves arising from right primary/secondary visual cortices in response to standard and structural deviant stimuli did not differ at all, indicating that this extraction of the abstract structural pattern of Chinese characters was left-lateralized. Besides, no difference was observed between source waves originating from any level of the visual cortex to standard and deviant stimuli that violated abstract tonal patterns, until 768 ms when a late effect related to conscious detection of targets occurred at higher levels of the visual cortex. Note that at late stages (later than 698 ms after stimulus onset), responses arising from bilateral associative visual cortices to standard and target stimuli differed for both sessions, no matter the structural or tonal feature was attended to. Our findings support the primitive intelligence of visual cortex to rapidly extract abstract orthographic patterns of Chinese characters that might be engaged in further lexical processing. Our findings also suggest that this rapid extraction can take place implicitly during reading."

Based on data gathered in Gdansk, Poland, hierarchical level modelling examines the socio-psychological mechanism that underlies an individual stakeholder’s intention to participate in the operation of a facility run by a municipality-owned company. It conceptualizes this interaction as location-dependent and nested. Results indicate that stakeholder attitude to the facility and their perception of influence were—unlike their perception of voice—positively related to their intention to participate in its functioning while location proved to be negatively related."
https://openalex.org/W3008721762,"Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is reported to promote the survival of neurons and salivary gland regeneration after radiation damage. This study investigated the effect of GDNF on cell migration, growth, and response to radiation in preclinical models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and correlated GDNF expression to treatment outcomes in HNSCC patients. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether systemic administration of GDNF at high dose is safe for the management of hyposalivation or xerostomia in HNSCC patients. Three HPV-positive and three HPV-negative cell lines were examined for cell migration, growth, and clonogenic survival in vitro and tumor growth assay in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining of GDNF, its receptors GFRα1 and its co-receptor RET was performed on two independent HNSCC tissue microarrays (TMA) and correlated to treatment outcomes. Results showed that GDNF only enhanced cell migration in two HPV-positive cells at supra-physiologic doses, but not in HPV-negative cells. GDNF did not increase cell survival in the tested cell lines post-irradiation. Likewise, GDNF treatment affected neither tumor growth in vitro nor response to radiation in xenografts in two HPV-positive and two HPV-negative HNSCC models. High stromal expression of GDNF protein was associated with worse overall survival in HPV-negative HNSCC on multivariate analysis in a combined cohort of patients from Stanford University (n = 82) and Washington University (n = 189); however, the association between GDNF gene expression and worse survival was not confirmed in a separate group of HPV-negative HNSCC patients identified from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on these data, we do not believe that GNDF is a safe systemic treatment to prevent or treat xerostomia in HNSCC and a local delivery approach such as intraglandular injection needs to be explored."
