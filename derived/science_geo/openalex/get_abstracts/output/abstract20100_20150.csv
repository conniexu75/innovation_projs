https://openalex.org/W2046241907,"Gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells has been used to mutate the murine DNA methyltransferase gene. ES cell lines homozygous for the mutation were generated by consecutive targeting of both wild-type alleles; the mutant cells were viable and showed no obvious abnormalities with respect to growth rate or morphology, and had only trace levels of DNA methyltransferase activity. A quantitative end-labeling assay showed that the level of m5C in the DNA of homozygous mutant cells was about one-third that of wild-type cells, and Southern blot analysis after cleavage of the DNA with a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease revealed substantial demethylation of endogenous retroviral DNA. The mutation was introduced into the germline of mice and found to cause a recessive lethal phenotype. Homozygous embryos were stunted, delayed in development, and did not survive past mid-gestation. The DNA of homozygous embryos showed a reduction of the level of m5C similar to that of homozygous ES cells. These results indicate that while a 3-fold reduction in levels of genomic m5C has no detectable effect on the viability or proliferation of ES cells in culture, a similar reduction of DNA methylation in embryos causes abnormal development and embryonic lethality."
https://openalex.org/W1975791071,"Methylation of mammalian DNA can lead to repression of transcription and alteration of chromatin structure. Recent evidence suggests that both effects are the result of an interaction between the methylated sites and methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MeCPs). MeCP1 has previously been detected in crude nuclear extracts. Here we report the identification, purification, and cDNA cloning of a novel MeCP called MeCP2. Unlike MeCP1, the new protein is able to bind to DNA that contains a single methyl-CpG pair. By staining with an antibody, we show that the distribution of MeCP2 along the chromosomes parallels that of methyl-CpG. In mouse, for example, MeCP2 is concentrated in pericentromeric heterochromatin, which contains a large fraction (about 40%) of all genomic 5-methylcytosine."

https://openalex.org/W1989794771,"Peptidyl transferase, the ribosomal activity responsible for catalysis of peptide bond formation, is resistant to vigorous procedures that are conventionally employed to remove proteins from protein-nucleic acid complexes. When the ""fragment reaction"" was used as a model assay for peptide bond formation, Escherichia coli ribosomes or 50S subunits retained 20 to 40 percent activity after extensive treatment with proteinase K and SDS, but lost activity after extraction with phenol or exposure to EDTA. Ribosomes from the thermophilic eubacterium Thermus aquaticus remained more than 80 percent active after treatment with proteinase K and SDS, which was followed by vigorous extraction with phenol. This activity is attributable to peptidyl transferase, as judged by specific inhibition by the peptidyl transferase-specific antibiotics chloramphenicol and carbomycin. In contrast, activity is abolished by treatment with ribonuclease T1. These findings support the possibility that 23S ribosomal RNA participates in the peptidyl transferase function."

https://openalex.org/W1977993125,"A monkey cDNA (pDTS) encoding a diphtheria toxin (DT) sensitivity determinant was isolated by expression cloning in mouse L-M cells. Mouse cells are naturally resistant to DT, because they lack functional cell surface receptors for the toxin. Unlike wild-type L-M cells, pDTS-transfected mouse cells are extremely toxin sensitive and specifically bind radioiodinated DT. Intoxication of the transfected cells requires receptor-mediated endocytosis of the bound toxin. The cDNA is predicted to encode an integral membrane protein that is identical to the precursor of a heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor. The DT sensitivity protein is thus a growth factor precursor that DT exploits as a receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2052865938,"Despite its importance, the molecular basis of mammalian gamete recognition has remained unclear. The enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (Gal-transferase) has been viewed traditionally as a biosynthetic component of the Golgi complex, but is also found on the surface of many cells where it can bind its specific glycoside substrate on adjacent cell surfaces or in the extracellular matrix. In mouse it has been suggested that Gal-transferase on the sperm head mediates fertilization by binding oligosaccharide residues in the egg coat, or zona pellucida, and that the ability of the zona pellucida to bind sperm is conferred by oligosaccharides of the ZP3 glycoprotein. However, it has not been confirmed that Gal-transferase and ZP3 are in fact complementary gamete receptors whose interaction mediates sperm-egg binding. Here we show that mouse sperm Gal-transferase specifically recognizes those oligosaccharides on ZP3 that have sperm-binding activity, but does not interact with other zona pellucida glycoproteins. In contrast, all zona pellucida glycoproteins are recognized by non-sperm Gal-transferase, demonstrating a more stringent substrate specificity for the sperm enzyme. This interaction is required for sperm-egg binding because blocking or removing the binding site for Gal-transferase on ZP3 inhibits its ability to bind sperm. After the release of the sperm acrosome, the transferase relocalizes to a new membrane domain where it can no longer bind to ZP3, which is consistent with the inability of acrosome-reacted sperm to bind ZP3 or to initiate binding to the zona pellucida. Following fertilization, ZP3 is modified by egg cortical granule secretions so that it loses sperm receptor activity, which can be accounted for by a selective loss of its binding site for sperm Gal-transferase. These results show that sperm surface beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase and the egg-coat glycoprotein ZP3 are complementary adhesion molecules that mediate primary gamete binding in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2019800929,"The relation of cellular activity in the motor cortex to the direction of two-dimensional isometric force was investigated under dynamic conditions in monkeys. A task was designed so that three force variables were dissociated: the force exerted by the subject, the net force, and the change in force. Recordings of neuronal activity in the motor cortex revealed that the activity of single cells was directionally tuned and that this tuning was invariant across different directions of a bias force. Cell activity was not related to the direction of force exerted by the subject, which changed drastically as the bias force changed. In contrast, the direction of net force, the direction of force change, and the visually instructed direction all remained quite invariant and congruent and could be the directional variables, alone or in combination, to which cell activity might relate."

https://openalex.org/W2027168767,"The D and L forms of the enzyme HIV-1 protease have been prepared by total chemical synthesis. The two proteins had identical covalent structures. However, the folded protein-enzyme enantiomers showed reciprocal chiral specificity on peptide substrates. That is, each enzyme enantiomer cut only the corresponding substrate enantiomer. Reciprocal chiral specificity was also evident in the effect of enantiomeric inhibitors. These data imply that the folded forms of the chemically synthesized D- and L-enzyme molecules are mirror images of one another in all elements of the three-dimensional structure. Enantiomeric proteins are expected to display reciprocal chiral specificity in all aspects of their biochemical interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2037367542,"Vertebrate T cells express either an αβ or γδ T cell receptor (TCR). The developmental relatedness of the two cell types is unresolved. αβ+ T cells respond to specific pathogens by collaborating with immunoglobulin-producing B cells in distinct lymphoid organs such as the spleen and Peyer's patches. The precise influence of αβ+ T cells on B cell development is poorly understood. To investigate the developmental effects of αβ+ T cells on B cells and γδ+T cells, mice homozygous for a disrupted TCRα gene were generated. The homozygotes showed elimination of αβ+ T cells and the loss of thymic medullae. Despite this, γδ+ T cells developed in normal numbers, and there was an increase in splenic B cells."

https://openalex.org/W1985993046,"When selection differs between the sexes, a mutation beneficial to one sex may be harmful to the other (sexually antagonistic). Because the sexes share a common gene pool, selection in one sex can interfere with the other's adaptive evolution. Theory predicts that sexually antagonistic mutations should accumulate in tight linkage with a new sex-determining gene, even when the harm to benefit ratio is high. Genetic markers and artificial selection were used to make a pair of autosomal genes segregate like a new pair of sex-determining genes in a Drosophila melanogaster model system. A 29-generation study provides experimental evidence that sexually antagonistic genes may be common in nature and will accumulate in response to a new sex-determining gene."
https://openalex.org/W1991606993,"Regulation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene expression by the p50 and p65 subunits of the DNA binding protein NF-kappa B was studied in nontransformed CD4+ T lymphocyte clones. A homodimeric complex of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit was found in resting T cells. The amount of p50-p50 complex decreased after full antigenic stimulation, whereas the amount of the NF-kappa B p50-p65 heterodimer was increased. Increased expression of the IL-2 gene and activity of the IL-2 kappa B DNA binding site correlated with a decrease in the p50-p50 complex. Overexpression of p50 repressed IL-2 promoter expression. The switch from p50-p50 to p50-p65 complexes depended on a protein that caused sequestration of the p50-p50 complex in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2052383501,"The antigenic structures that initiate T cell responses to foreign (allogeneic) cells have long attracted considerable interest. We have purified and sequenced a peptide from mouse spleen that is recognized in association with the class I MHC protein H-2Ld by 2C, an alloreactive CD8+ T cell clone. The peptide (LSP-FPFDL) greatly enhances the susceptibility of Ld+ cells to lysis by 2C, and this activity is completely blocked by a clonotypic antibody against the 2C T cell receptor. Thus, this study characterizes the naturally occurring peptide moiety of an MHC-I/peptide complex recognized by alloreactive CD8+ T cells. The peptide, which occurs in the thymus of MHC-disparate mice, can be used to study T cell development in mice expressing transgenes for the 2C T cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1964667809,"We have isolated two cytosolic fractions from Xenopus oocytes that contain all of the activity necessary to support both steps of nuclear import in digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells: binding at the nuclear envelope and translocation through the nuclear pore. The first cytosolic fraction (fraction A) interacts with an import-competent, but not a mutant, nuclear localization sequence-bearing conjugate and stimulates its accumulation at the nuclear envelope in an ATP-independent fashion. The second cytosolic fraction (fraction B) gives no discernible effect when added alone; but when added either together with fraction A, or after fraction A, stimulates the passage of the conjugate from the outer nuclear envelope to the interior of the nucleus in an ATP-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1997816574,"Low concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) evoke a very rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores in many cell types, which can be followed by a further, much slower efflux. Two explanations have been suggested for this biphasic release. The first proposes that the Ca2+ stores vary in their sensitivity to InsP3, and each store releases either its entire contents or nothing (all-or-none release); the second proposes instead that the stores are uniformly sensitive to the effects of InsP3, but that they can release only a fraction of their Ca2+ before their sensitivity is somehow attenuated (steady-state release). Experiments using purified InsP3 receptor molecules reconstituted into lipid vesicles have shown heterogeneity of the receptors in their response to InsP3 under conditions in which the total Ca2+ level at both sides of the receptor is held constant. We now report that in permeabilized A7r5 smooth-muscle cells incubated in Ca(2+)-free medium, the amount of 45Ca2+ remaining in the stores after the rapid transient phase of release is independent of their initial Ca2+ levels, indicating that partially depleted stores are less sensitive to InsP3. Moreover, if the stores are reloaded with 40Ca2+ after the first stimulus, reapplication of the same low concentration of InsP3 will release further 45Ca2+. This recovery of InsP3 sensitivity is almost complete. Under these conditions, Ca2+ release must thus occur by a steady-state mechanism, in which the decreasing Ca2+ content of the stores slows down further release."
https://openalex.org/W2094412953,"A triple helix is formed upon binding of an oligodeoxynucleotide to the major groove of duplex DNA. A benzo[e]pyridoindole derivative (BePI) strongly stabilized this structure and showed preferential binding to a triplex rather than to a duplex. Energy transfer experiments suggest that BePI intercalates within the triple helix. Sequence-specific inhibition of transcription initiation of a specific gene by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase by a triplex-forming oligodeoxynucleotide is strongly enhanced when the triplex is stabilized by BePI. Upon irradiation with ultraviolet light, BePI induces covalent modifications of the target within the triple helix structure."
https://openalex.org/W2080904282,"The molecules essential to the continual morphogenesis and shedding of the opsin-containing disks of vertebrate photoreceptors are largely unknown. We describe a 37 kd protein, rom-1, which is 35% identical and structurally similar to peripherin/retinal degeneration slow (rds). Like peripherin, rom-1 is a retina-specific integral membrane protein localized to the photoreceptor disk rim. The two proteins are similarly oriented in the membrane, and each has a highly conserved ( residues) cysteine- and proline-rich domain in the disk lumen. Although both rom-1 and peripherin form disulfide-linked dimers, they do not form heterodimers with each other, but appear to associate noncovalently. These results suggest both that rom-1 and peripherin are functionally related members of a new photoreceptor-specific protein family and that rom-1, like peripherin, is likely to be important to outer segment morphogenesis. The association of mutations in RDS with retinitis pigmentosa indicates that ROM1 is a strong candidate gene for human retinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2003215039,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) mRNA is stored, stable and untranslated, in the cytoplasm of fully grown primary mouse oocytes. Dormancy is associated with an unusually short poly(A) tail, and poly(A) tail elongation controls tPA mRNA translational activation during meiotic maturation. Here we show that the nuclear transcript of this mRNA is extensively polyadenylated and that primary oocytes contain a deadenylating activity capable of silencing the cytoplasmic message. The sequence determinants that control deadenylation and polyadenylation overlap; this AU-rich region thus serves as an adenylation control element (ACE). The translation of a reporter mRNA in primary oocytes is prevented upon inclusion of an ACE in its 3' untranslated region. Therefore, the stage-specific regulation of poly(A) tail length accounts for the regulated synthesis of tPA in oocytes, and reversible deadenylation provides a mechanism for the translational control of dormant mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2043644025,"The argos gene encodes a protein that is required for viability and that regulates the determination of cells in the Drosophila eye. A developmental analysis of argos mutant eyes indicates that the mystery cells, which are usually nonneuronal, are transformed into extra photoreceptors, and that supernumerary cone cells and pigment cells are also recruited. Clonal analysis indicates that argos acts nonautonomously and can diffuse over the range of several cell diameters. Conceptual translation of the argos gene suggests that it encodes a secreted protein."

https://openalex.org/W2058433936,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression was studied in the hippocampus at various developmental stages in normal rats and following kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure activity. Systemic administration of KA strongly elevated BDNF mRNA levels in all hippocampal subregions after postnatal day 21. In contrast, even though KA induced intense behavioral seizure activity at postnatal day 8, the seizures were not associated with elevations of BDNF mRNA levels, indicating a clear dissociation between behavioral seizures and increases in BDNF mRNA levels and contradicting the view that BDNF mRNA expression is principally regulated by neuronal activity. In the dentate gyrus at postnatal day 13, intense BDNF mRNA expression was limited to a defined area at the border between granule cell and molecular layers, suggesting the possibility that segregation of BDNF mRNA into defined subcellular compartments may play a role in establishing the well-delineated patterns of innervation in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2024727214,"K+ channels are major determinants of membrane excitability. Differences in neuronal excitability within the nervous system may arise from differential expression of K+ channel genes, regulated spatially in a cell type-specific manner, or temporally in response to neuronal activity. We have compared the distribution of mRNAs of three K+ channel genes, Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv4.2 in rat brain, and examined activity-dependent changes following treatment with the convulsant drug pentylenetetrazole. Both regional and cell type-specific differences of K+ channel gene expression were found. In addition, seizure activity caused a reduction of Kv1.2 and Kv4.2 mRNAs in the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus, raising the possibility that K+ channel gene regulation may play a role in long-term neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2030135048,"Several classes of ribozymes (catalytic RNA's) catalyze reactions at phosphorus centers, but apparently no reaction at a carbon center has been demonstrated. The active site of the Tetrahymena ribozyme was engineered to bind an oligonucleotide derived from the 3' end of N-formyl-methionyl-tRNA(fMet). This ribozyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the aminoacyl ester bond to a modest extent, 5 to 15 times greater than the uncatalyzed rate. Catalysis involves binding of the oligonucleotide to the internal guide sequence of the ribozyme and requires Mg2+ and sequence elements of the catalytic core. The ability of RNA to catalyze reactions with aminoacyl esters expands the catalytic versatility of RNA and suggests that the first aminoacyl tRNA synthetase could have been an RNA molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2117583588,"The three-dimensional solution structure of recombinant human interleukin-4, a protein of 133 residues and 15.4 kilodaltons that plays a key role in the immune and inflammatory systems, has been solved by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure is dominated by a left-handed four-helix bundle with an unusual topology comprising two overhand connections. The linker elements between the helices are formed by either long loops, small helical turns, or short strands. The overall topology is remarkably similar to that of growth hormone and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, despite the absence of any sequence homology, and substantial differences in the relative lengths of the helices, the length and nature of the various connecting elements, and the pattern of disulfide bridges. These three proteins, however, bind to cell surface receptors belonging to the same hematopoietic superfamily, which suggests that interleukin-4 may interact with its receptor in an analogous manner to that observed in the crystal structure of the growth hormone-extracellular receptor complex."

https://openalex.org/W1674582945,"Aspirin selectively acetylates Ser-530 of prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase-1. This causes inactivation of the cyclooxygenase activity of the enzyme, but does not appreciably affect its peroxidase activity. Although the aspirin-acetylated enzyme is inactive, we found that PGH synthase-1 in which Ser-530 had been replaced with an alanine was catalytically active; accordingly, we proposed that aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase activity by placing a larger than normal side chain at position 530 thereby interfering with arachidonate binding (DeWitt, D.L., El-Harith, E. A., Kraemer, S. A., Andrews, M. J., Yao, E. F., Armstrong, R. L., and Smith, W. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5192-5198). As a further test of this hypothesis we have used site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression in cos-1 cells to prepare and characterize five additional substitutions of Ser-530. Consistent with our proposal, the presence of amino acids with bulky side chains at position 530 inhibited cyclooxygenase activity and decreased the apparent affinity of the enzyme for arachidonate. In related work, we characterized a series of mutant PGH synthases-1 having substitutions at residues adjoining Ser-530, including Phe-529, Leu-531, Lys-532, and Gly-533, in order to evaluate the contributions of each residue to cyclooxygenase catalysis. The most significant conclusion of this part of the study is that residues 529-533 all are important for the peroxidase activity as well as the cyclooxygenase activity of PGH synthase-1. Phe-529, in particular, was found to be critical for PGH synthase-1 structure and catalysis; some substitutions at this position led to the production of proteins lacking about 100 amino acids from their COOH termini."

https://openalex.org/W2062944755,"Sympathetic neurons display robust [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to caffeine and mild depolarization. Oscillations occur at constant membrane potential, ruling out voltage-dependent changes in plasma membrane conductance. They are terminated by ryanodine, implicating Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. Ca2+ entry is necessary for sustained oscillatory activity, but its importance varies within the oscillatory cycle: the slow interspike rise in [Ca2+]i requires Ca2+ entry, but the rapid upstroke does not, indicating that it reflects internal Ca2+ release. Sudden alterations in [Ca2+]o, [K+]o, or [caffeine]o produce immediate changes in d[Ca2+]i/dt and provide information about the relative rates of surface membrane Ca2+ transport as well as uptake and release by internal stores. Based on our results, [Ca2+]i oscillations can be explained in terms of coordinated changes in Ca2+ fluxes across surface and store membranes."

This cyanobacterial myoglobin, referred to as cyanoglobin, was shown to be a soluble hemoprotein of 12.5 kilodaltons with an amino acid sequence that is related to that of myoglobins from two lower eukaryotes, the ciliated protozoa Paramecium caudatum and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cyanoglobin is encoded by the glbN gene, which is positioned between nifU and nifH-two genes essential for nitrogen fixation-in the genome of Nostoc. Cyanoglobin was detected in Nostoc cells only when they were starved for nitrogen and incubated microaerobically."
https://openalex.org/W2074659620,"The biological activity of Ras proteins is thought to be controlled by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor and the guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP). Treatment of rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) increased the amount of active Ras guanosine triphosphate complex and stimulated the activities of both the guanine nucleotide exchange factor and GAP. In PC-12 cells that overexpressed the tyrosine kinase encoded by the trk proto-oncogene (a component of the high-affinity NGF receptor), the NGF-induced activation of the regulatory proteins was potentiated. These results suggest that the NGF receptor system enhances the activities of both the guanine nucleotide exchange factor and GAP and that the activation of Ras might be controlled by the balance in activity between these two regulatory proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2013927471,"The process by which the vertebrate central nervous system acquires its regional properties remains a central problem in developmental biology. It is generally argued that at early gastrula stages the dorsal mesoderm possesses precise anterior-posterior positional information, which is subsequently imparted to the overlying ectoderm. However, using regionally specific gene probes to monitor regional responses in Xenopus embryos, we find that anterior-posterior properties are not fixed until early neurula stages. During gastrulation the regional inducing capacities of the dorsal mesoderm as well as the regional responses of the presumptive neural ectoderm are activated along the entire anterior-posterior axis when these properties are assayed in recombinant and explant experiments, respectively. Restriction of regional inducing capacity in the mesoderm and responsiveness in the neural ectoderm occur only at neural plate stages."

To test whether contact with the CNS regulates maturation, neonatal rat olfactory cells were grown on a culture substrate or on CNS astrocytes. Mature ORNs, immunopositive for olfactory marker protein (OMP), disappeared rapidly from both systems. Neurons positive for neuron-specific tubulin (immature and mature) disappeared from substrate-only cultures, but remained abundant in the cocultures. OMP-positive neurons reappeared after 10 days in vitro. Pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine showed extensive neurogenesis of both immature and mature olfactory neurons. This demonstrates, in vitro, both division and differentiation of olfactory progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040113523,"Virally infected neurons avoid destruction by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by failing to express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Like neurons in vivo and in primary culture, the OBL21 neuronal cell line expressed barely detectable levels of MHC class I molecules. This correlated with very low levels of mRNAs for the MHC class I heavy chains (αC). OBL21 cells also fail to provide MHC class I molecules with the peptides necessary for their efficient assembly and transport to the cell surface. This function can be restored by treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The mRNA for peptide transporters HAM1 and HAM2 was not detectable in OBL21 neuronal cells, but was induced by IFN-γ treatment. Hence, the ability of neurons to evade CTL-mediated killing results from expression at low levels of the MHC class I αC, the peptide transporters HAM1 and HAM2, and possibly other genes of the peptide-loading machinery."

Here we demonstrate that GPA can be purified and cloned from embryonic day 15 (E15) chick eyes, which contain all the target tissues of the CG. Our studies show the following: GPA mRNA is induced in embryonic chick eyes during the period of CG neuron cell death; GPA mRNA is expressed specifically in the layer of the eye that contains the targets of the CG and in primary cultures of smooth muscle cells isolated from the choroid layer of the eye; and biologically active GPA is released from cells transfected with a GPA cDNA."

https://openalex.org/W1554329457,"Coagulation factor X, when activated to factor Xa by proteolytic cleavage, itself becomes an active serine protease which participates as a component of the macromolecular prothrombinase complex along with factor Va, phospholipid, and calcium ions. To identify specific structural regions on factor Xa responsible for mediating its function in activating prothrombin, we used 21 synthetic peptides corresponding to 65% of the primary structure of factor X as potential inhibitors of prothrombin activation. Using purified components, thrombin formation was inhibited by seven peptides in a dose-dependent noncompetitive manner. Antibodies to selected inhibitory peptides affinity purified on a factor Xa-agarose column inhibited thrombin formation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the corresponding regions on factor Xa are surface-exposed. Kinetic analyses varying the order of reagent addition suggested that peptides 211-222, 254-269, and 263-274 were highly effective in preventing the factor Xa-factor Va interaction. Peptides 275-287 and 415-425 were considered to derive from a distal region involved in substrate binding, based upon mixed inhibition kinetic analyses and assuming that inhibitory peptides not inhibitory in factor Va binding are related to a specific region of substrate interaction. Cross-linking studies confirmed that peptides 263-274 and 263-276 could bind specifically to the light chain of factor V/Va. These findings provide the basis for further pursuing the precise definition of interactive sites on factor Xa using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling."
https://openalex.org/W1967574163,"The two central photoreceptor neurons of the Drosophila eye, R7 and R8, form a retinotopic map in the optic lobe of the fly brain. We have developed a technique that allows us to visualize the projections of these neurons with high resolution. Using this technique, we have identified a new mutant, mip (more inner photoreceptors), in which this map shows a striking hyperinnervation. The extra terminals in the brain derive from an excessive recruitment of sevenless-independent R7 photoreceptor cells during eye development. The original R7, however, remains sevenless responsive. The behavior of this gene suggests that recruitment to the R7 pathway, and possibly to multiple programs in ommatidial assembly, is partially regulated by inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1600638878,"A minisatellite-binding protein, Msbp-4, with a molecular mass of 35 kDa has been purified from mouse tumor cells that binds to hypervariable Pc-1 and Pc-2 minisatellites. The binding is much more efficient than that to genetically stable minisatellite homologues. As assayed by Southwestern analysis, Msbp-4 favors multiple copies of the Pc-2 repeat sequence GGCAGGA and requires the cytosine-rich single strand for the binding. The activity is also present in extracts from mouse testis but not from liver. The phosphatase treatment revealed that Msbp-4 is phosphorylated and may have a regulatory function, because dephosphorylation affects the activity and specificity of the binding. Sequence preference is demonstrated by a competition experiment using single-base substitution mutants. Thus, the binding properties of Msbp-4 observed here lead to an implication that the protein-DNA complexes result in formation of a single-stranded DNA loop of the G-rich strand in the minisatellite which may enhance the ability of the minisatellite to undergo recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1526223266,"The effect of 4,4'-(isopropylidenedithio)bis(2,6-di-t-butylphenol) (probucol) on cholesteryl ester physical state was examined in dry mixtures, phospholipid-containing dispersions, and cells. Probucol has little effect on the solid to isotropic transition of cholesteryl oleate, but broadens and decreases the enthalpy of the liquid-crystalline transitions at concentrations as low as 1-2 mol %. A probucol transition is only observed at concentrations greater than 20 mol %. The mesomorphic phases of the cholesteryl oleate/probucol mixtures were identified by visual inspection and polarized light microscopy. Mixtures are liquid at probucol concentrations in excess of 5 mol % at 37 degrees C. Probucol also dramatically reduces the enthalpy of the liquid-crystalline transitions of the cholesteryl oleate core of dispersions of the ester with phospholipids at a concentration of 10 mol %, reducing the enthalpy by greater than 80% and the transition temperatures by approximately 2 degrees C. The phase state of cholesteryl esters in Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells was examined after incubation with cholesterol/phospholipid dispersions that caused the accumulation of anisotropic cholesteryl ester droplets. Differential scanning calorimetry scans of cells incubated with cholesterol-rich phospholipid dispersions indicated a phase transition near 48 degrees C, which was abolished when the cells were co-incubated with 50-100 micrograms/ml of probucol in the loading medium. Subsequent to the formation of isotropic cholesteryl ester droplets in the presence of probucol, the rate of efflux of cholesterol from the cells to phosphatidylcholine-containing acceptors in the medium was increased. These data show that probucol is relatively soluble in cholesteryl esters and that probucol changes the phase state of cholesteryl ester droplets in cells to a more fluid phase in which the cholesteryl esters are more readily mobilized."

In this paper, we provide information on the effects of C-terminal processing of nerve growth factor. Three forms of recombinant mouse beta-nerve growth factor (rNGF) were produced and isolated from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus. The three purified forms of rNGF exhibited distinct biological activities and differed in their abilities to compete with high affinity binding of mouse beta-nerve growth factor (mNGF). However, they were chemically and structurally indistinguishable from each other. All three forms of rNGF differed from mature mNGF from mouse submaxillary gland in that the C-terminal Arg-Gly dipeptide had not been proteolytically removed. Removal of the C-terminal dipeptide by gamma-NGF peptidase treatment converted the three forms into a single form identical with mature mNGF. The above results demonstrate that a single polypeptide of rNGF, due to the presence of a C-terminal dipeptide, exhibits three stable dimeric protein conformations with distinct biological activities. The apparent lack of gamma-NGF peptidase in the nervous system raises the possibility that the biologically significant form of NGF may differ from mature mNGF; such a difference may be of physiological relevance."
