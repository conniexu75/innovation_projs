https://openalex.org/W3164758053,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly developed into a global epidemic. To control its spread, countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as school closures, bans of small gatherings, or even stay-at-home orders. Here we study the effectiveness of seven NPIs in reducing the number of new infections, which was inferred from the reported cases of COVID-19 using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model. Based on data from the first epidemic wave of n = 20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries, Norway, and Switzerland), we estimate the relative reduction in the number of new infections attributed to each NPI. Among the NPIs considered, bans of large gatherings were most effective, followed by venue and school closures, whereas stay-at-home orders and work-from-home orders were least effective. With this retrospective cross-country analysis, we provide estimates regarding the effectiveness of different NPIs during the first epidemic wave."
https://openalex.org/W3164910760,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing dramatically worldwide. Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) as key regulators of gene expression, has been reported in numerous diseases including diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels of miRNA-122, miRNA-126-3p and miRNA-146a in diabetic and pre-diabetic patients and in healthy individuals, and to determine whether the changes in the level of these miRNAs are reliable biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, and pathogenesis of T2DM. Additionally, we examined the relationship between miRNA levels and plasma concentrations of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (Il-6) as well as insulin resistance. In this case-control study, participants (n = 90) were allocated to three groups (n = 30/group): T2DM, pre-diabetes and healthy individuals as control (males and females, age: 25-65, body mass index: 25-35). Expression of miRNA was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and fasting insulin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as an indicator of insulin resistance. MiRNA-122 levels were higher while miRNA-126-3p and miRNA-146a levels were lower in T2DM and pre-diabetic patients compared to control (p<0.05). Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between miRNA-122 expression and TNF-α (r = 0.82), IL-6 (r = 0.83) and insulin resistance (r = 0.8). Conversely, negative correlations were observed between miRNA-126-3p and miRNA-146a levels and TNF-α (r = -0.7 and r = -0.82 respectively), IL-6 (r = -0.65 and r = -0.78 respectively) as well as insulin resistance (r = -0.67 and r = -0.78 respectively) (all p<0.05). Findings of this study suggest the miRNAs can potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM. Further studies are required to examine the reproducibility of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3165176743,"The neuronal mechanisms generating a delayed motor response initiated by a sensory cue remain elusive. Here, we tracked the precise sequence of cortical activity in mice transforming a brief whisker stimulus into delayed licking using wide-field calcium imaging, multiregion high-density electrophysiology, and time-resolved optogenetic manipulation. Rapid activity evoked by whisker deflection acquired two prominent features for task performance: (1) an enhanced excitation of secondary whisker motor cortex, suggesting its important role connecting whisker sensory processing to lick motor planning; and (2) a transient reduction of activity in orofacial sensorimotor cortex, which contributed to suppressing premature licking. Subsequent widespread cortical activity during the delay period largely correlated with anticipatory movements, but when these were accounted for, a focal sustained activity remained in frontal cortex, which was causally essential for licking in the response period. Our results demonstrate key cortical nodes for motor plan generation and timely execution in delayed goal-directed licking."

This was compared against the SRKT, Hoffer-Q, Holladay1, simplified Haigis with 1 optimized constant and Haigis formula with 3 optimized constants. A large dataset of preoperative biometric values, lens power data and postoperative refraction data was split into training and test sets. The training data were used for formula constant optimization, and the test data for cross-validation. Constant optimization was performed for all formulae using nonlinear optimization, minimising root mean squared prediction error.The constants for all formulae were derived with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Applying these constants to the test data, the Castrop formula showed a slightly better performance compared to the classical formulae in terms of prediction error and absolute prediction error. Using the Castrop formula, the standard deviation of the prediction error was lowest at 0.45 dpt, and 95% of all eyes in the test data were within the limit of 0.9 dpt of prediction error.The calculation concept of the Castrop formula and one potential option for optimization of the 3 Castrop formula constants (C, H, and R) are presented. In a large dataset of 1452 data points the performance of the Castrop formula was slightly superior to the respective results of the classical formulae such as SRKT, Hoffer-Q, Holladay1 or Haigis."
https://openalex.org/W3165466498,"Rapid diagnosis is key to curtailing the Covid-19 pandemic. One path to such rapid diagnosis may rely on identifying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the infected body, or in other words, identifying the smell of the infection. Consistent with this rationale, dogs can use their nose to identify Covid-19 patients. Given the scale of the pandemic, however, animal deployment is a challenging solution. In contrast, electronic noses (eNoses) are machines aimed at mimicking animal olfaction, and these can be deployed at scale. To test the hypothesis that SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with a body-odor detectable by an eNose, we placed a generic eNose in-line at a drive-through testing station. We applied a deep learning classifier to the eNose measurements, and achieved real-time detection of SARS CoV-2 infection at a level significantly better than chance, for both symptomatic and non-symptomatic participants. This proof of concept with a generic eNose implies that an optimized eNose may allow effective real-time diagnosis, which would provide for extensive relief in the Covid-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3165831585,"The concept of urban vibrancy has become increasingly important in the study of cities. A vibrant urban environment is an area of a city with high levels of human activity and interactions. Traditionally, studying our cities and what makes them vibrant has been very difficult, due to challenges in data collection on urban environments and people's location and interactions. Here, we rely on novel sources of data to investigate how different features of our cities may relate to urban vibrancy. In particular, we explore whether there are any differences in which urban features make an environment vibrant for different age groups. We perform this quantitative analysis by extracting urban features from OpenStreetMap and the Italian census, and using them in spatial models to describe urban vibrancy. Our analysis shows a strong relationship between urban features and urban vibrancy, and particularly highlights the importance of third places, which are urban places offering opportunities for social interactions. Our findings provide evidence that a combination of mobile phone data with crowdsourced urban features can be used to better understand urban vibrancy."
https://openalex.org/W3164089558,"Background Pancreatic cancer (PC) represents a substantial public health burden. Pancreatic cancer patients have very low survival due to the difficulty of identifying cancers early when the tumour is localised to the site of origin and treatable. Recent progress has been made in identifying biomarkers for PC in the blood and urine, but these cannot be used for population-based screening as this would be prohibitively expensive and potentially harmful. Methods We conducted a case-control study using prospectively-collected electronic health records from primary care individually-linked to cancer registrations. Our cases were comprised of 1,139 patients, aged 15–99 years, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2009. Each case was age-, sex- and diagnosis time-matched to four non-pancreatic (cancer patient) controls. Disease and prescription codes for the 24 months prior to diagnosis were used to identify 57 individual symptoms. Using a machine learning approach, we trained a logistic regression model on 75% of the data to predict patients who later developed PC and tested the model’s performance on the remaining 25%. Results We were able to identify 41.3% of patients &lt; = 60 years at ‘high risk’ of developing pancreatic cancer up to 20 months prior to diagnosis with 72.5% sensitivity, 59% specificity and, 66% AUC. 43.2% of patients &gt;60 years were similarly identified at 17 months, with 65% sensitivity, 57% specificity and, 61% AUC. We estimate that combining our algorithm with currently available biomarker tests could result in 30 older and 400 younger patients per cancer being identified as ‘potential patients’, and the earlier diagnosis of around 60% of tumours. Conclusion After further work this approach could be applied in the primary care setting and has the potential to be used alongside a non-invasive biomarker test to increase earlier diagnosis. This would result in a greater number of patients surviving this devastating disease."
https://openalex.org/W3164161508,"Understanding the factors that determine if a person can successfully learn a novel sensory skill is essential for understanding how the brain adapts to change, and for providing rehabilitative support for people with sensory loss. We report a training study investigating the effects of blindness and age on the learning of a complex auditory skill: click-based echolocation. Blind and sighted participants of various ages (21-79 yrs; median blind: 45 yrs; median sighted: 26 yrs) trained in 20 sessions over the course of 10 weeks in various practical and virtual navigation tasks. Blind participants also took part in a 3-month follow up survey assessing the effects of the training on their daily life. We found that both sighted and blind people improved considerably on all measures, and in some cases performed comparatively to expert echolocators at the end of training. Somewhat surprisingly, sighted people performed better than those who were blind in some cases, although our analyses suggest that this might be better explained by the younger age (or superior binaural hearing) of the sighted group. Importantly, however, neither age nor blindness was a limiting factor in participants' rate of learning (i.e. their difference in performance from the first to the final session) or in their ability to apply their echolocation skills to novel, untrained tasks. Furthermore, in the follow up survey, all participants who were blind reported improved mobility, and 83% reported better independence and wellbeing. Overall, our results suggest that the ability to learn click-based echolocation is not strongly limited by age or level of vision. This has positive implications for the rehabilitation of people with vision loss or in the early stages of progressive vision loss."
https://openalex.org/W3165867903,"We aimed to examine the number of teeth and masticatory function as oral health indices and clarify their roles in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and diabetes mellitus in community-dwelling older adults.This cross-sectional study was conducted with 635 older adults in Ohnan, Shimane Prefecture, in rural Japan. The number of teeth and masticatory function (measured by the number of gummy jelly pieces collected after chewing) were evaluated by dental hygienists. Sarcopenia status was assessed using handgrip strength, skeletal muscle index, calf circumference, and a possible sarcopenia diagnosis based on the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019. Diabetes mellitus status was defined as a hemoglobin A1c level ≥6.5% or self-reported diabetes. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between oral health, sarcopenia, and diabetes mellitus after adjusting for confounders.After adjusting for all confounders, logistic regression analysis showed that the number of remaining teeth was negatively associated with a low level of handgrip strength (odds ratio [OR], 0.961; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.932-0.992) and possible sarcopenia (OR, 0.949; 95% CI, 0.907-0.992). Higher levels of masticatory function were also negatively associated with a low level of handgrip strength (OR, 0.965; 95% CI, 0.941-0.990) and possible sarcopenia (OR, 0.941; 95% CI, 0.904-0.979). Logistic regression analysis showed that the number of remaining teeth and a higher level of masticatory function were negatively associated with diabetes mellitus (OR, 0.978; 95% CI, 0.957-0.999; OR, 0.976; 95% CI, 0.960-0.992, respectively).Our findings suggest that improvement in oral health, including the maintenance of masticatory function and remaining teeth, may contribute to the prevention of sarcopenia and diabetes mellitus in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3164459387,"Gender minority (GM) adolescents, who have a different gender identity than their sex assigned at birth, may use substances as a coping strategy in response to GM-related stressors. This study examined longitudinal effects of gender minority stressors on substance use in GM adolescents, and related risk factors (internalized transphobia, depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms) and protective factors (resilience, gender-related pride, family functioning, social support, gender-related community connectedness).Participants were 30 GM adolescents, ages 13-17 years, from the U.S. community-based longitudinal Trans Teen and Family Narratives Project. Participants completed an online survey every 6 months across 2 years (5 waves; data collected 2015-2019).Exposure to gender minority stressors was associated with higher odds of alcohol use. Across models, internalized transphobia (risk factor), resilience (protective factor), and gender-related pride (protective factor) were the most significant mediators of associations between gender minority stressors and substance use. Family functioning and social support (protective factors) significantly moderated the association between gender minority stressors and alcohol use, such that family functioning and social support were protective for alcohol use at lower levels of gender minority stress, but not at higher levels.Results suggest that GM adolescents engage in substance use as a coping strategy in response to gender minority stressors. A number of hypothesized risk and protective factors mediated or moderated these associations. Future interventions with GM adolescents should focus efforts on addressing internalized transphobia as a risk factor and strengthening resilience, gender-related pride, and family functioning as protective factors for substance use."
https://openalex.org/W3165759008,"Obesity is a leading risk for poor health outcomes in England. We examined best- and worst-case scenarios for the future trajectory of the obesity epidemic.Taking the last 27 years of Health Survey for England data, we determined both position and shape of the adult body mass index (BMI) distribution and projected these parameters 20 years forward in time. For the best-case scenario, we fitted linear models, allowing for a quadratic relationship between the outcome variable and time, to reflect a potential reversal in upwards trends. For the worst-case scenario, we fitted non-linear models that applied an exponential function to reflect a potential flattening of trends over time. Best-fitting models were identified using Monte Carlo cross-validation on 1991-2014 data, and predictions of population prevalence across five BMI categories were then validated using 2015-17 data.Both linear and non-linear models showed a close fit to observed data (mean absolute error <2%). In the best-case scenario, the proportion of the population at increased risk (BMI≥25kg/m2) is predicted to fall from 66% in 2017 to 53% (95% confidence interval: 41% to 64%) in 2035. In the worst-case scenario, this proportion is likely to remain relatively stable overall- 64% (37% to 90%) in 2035 -but with an increasing proportion of the population at highest risk (BMI≥35kg/m2).While obesity prediction depends on chosen modelling methods, even under optimistic assumptions it is likely that the majority of the English population will still be at increased risk of disease due to their weight until at least 2035, without greater allocation of resources to effective interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3144671731,"The impacts of ecotourism on biodiversity are poorly understood and the outcome of this type of research is often contradictory. On the one hand ecotourism could impact the occurrence, survival or behavior of species, on the other hand ecotourism is often mentioned as providing a ""human shield"" by deterring negative practices like gold mining, logging and hunting. Brownsberg Nature Park is easily the most visited protected area of Suriname, with a high number of ecotourists visiting from abroad. A four-year study on the impact of ecotourism on medium-large terrestrial mammals was carried out between 2013 and 2016 using 16 camera trap stations. The area has a clear gradient of tourism pressure, with the pressure decreasing further away from the lodging facilities. Evidently, the impacts of human presence on the mammal communities were more significant in the busiest areas. Most species avoided areas with many hikers or switched to a more nocturnal activity pattern. In these areas the impact was not reflected in species numbers, however it was causing a significant decrease in the diversity of mammals. On the other hand, vehicles had little impact on species avoidance or diversity, but did increase nocturnality, even more than hikers. A few species seemed to be ""attracted"" by hikers and/or traffic. Giant armadillos (Priodontes maximus) and spotted pacas (Cuniculus paca) used the pools in the road created by traffic. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), margays (Leopardus wiedii) and red-rumped agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina) seemed to favor human disturbance probably because of predator release. Some of the most impacted species were the jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor) and lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), all three species with significant contribution to ecosystem balance. Management measures should focus on lowering the number of hikers in popular places and limiting the number of vehicles in recreational areas."
https://openalex.org/W3153374607,"Languages emerge and change over time at the population level though interactions between individual speakers. It is, however, hard to directly observe how a single speaker’s linguistic innovation precipitates a population-wide change in the language, and many theoretical proposals exist. We introduce a very general mathematical model that encompasses a wide variety of individual-level linguistic behaviours and provides statistical predictions for the population-level changes that result from them. This model allows us to compare the likelihood of empirically-attested changes in definite and indefinite articles in multiple languages under different assumptions on the way in which individuals learn and use language. We find that accounts of language change that appeal primarily to errors in childhood language acquisition are very weakly supported by the historical data, whereas those that allow speakers to change incrementally across the lifespan are more plausible, particularly when combined with social network effects."
https://openalex.org/W3165716999,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Due to its low prevalence, epidemiological and clinical information of SCLC patients retrieved from lung cancer registries is scarce.This was an observational multicenter study that enrolled patients with lung cancer and thoracic tumors, recruited from August 2016 to January 2020 at 50 Spanish hospitals. Demographic and clinical data, treatment patterns and survival of SCLC patients included in the Thoracic Tumor Registry (TTR) were analyzed.With a total of 956 cases, the age of 64.7 ± 9.1 years, 78.6% were men, 60.6% smokers, and ECOG PS 0, 1 or ≥ 2 in 23.1%, 53.0% and 23.8% of cases, respectively. Twenty percent of patients had brain metastases at the diagnosis. First-line chemotherapy (CT), mainly carboplatin or cisplatin plus etoposide was administered to >90% of patients. In total, 36.0% and 13.8% of patients received a second and third line of CT, respectively. Median overall survival was 9.5 months (95% CI 8.8-10.2 months), with an estimated rate of 70.3% (95% CI 67.2-73.4%), 38.9% (95% CI 35.4-42.4%), and 14.8% (95% CI 11.8-17.8%) at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively. Median progression-free survival was 6.3 months. Higher mortality and progression rates were significantly associated with male sex, older age, smoking habit, and ECOG PS 1-2. Long-term survival (> 2 years) was confirmed in 6.6% of patients, showing a positive correlation with better ECOG PS, poor smoking and absence of certain metastases at diagnosis.This study provides an updated overview of the clinical situation and treatment landscape of ES-SCLC in Spain. Our results might assist oncologists to improve current clinical practice towards a better prognosis for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3164732210,"Hypogonadism is reported to occur in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but earlier studies used low-sensitivity diagnostic techniques (CT, ultrasound), for NAFLD diagnosis. We hypothesized that if hypogonadism was due to NAFLD, and not solely attributable to underlying obesity/diabetes, it would be more severe in the presence of steatohepatitis (NASH). To examine the influence of liver disease on testosterone in males with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we used gold-standard liver imaging with MR-spectroscopy (1H-MRS), and performed liver biopsies to grade/stage the NAFLD.In this cross-sectional study, we measured in 175 males with T2DM total and free testosterone, markers of insulin resistance, and intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) by 1H-MRS. Those with NAFLD on imaging underwent a liver biopsy.Total testosterone was higher in the group without NAFLD (""No-NAFLD""; n = 48) compared to isolated steatosis (IS; n = 62) or NASH (n = 65) (385 ± 116 vs. 339 ± 143 vs. 335 ± 127 ng/ml, ptrend 0.03). Testosterone was also lower in obese vs. non-obese subjects in both the No-NAFLD and IS groups (p = 0.06 and p = 0.11, respectively), but not in obese vs. non-obese patients with NASH (p = 0.81). IHTG was independently associated with total testosterone (ß = -4.8, p = 0.004). None of the liver histology characteristics were associated with lower testosterone.NAFLD is linked to lower total testosterone in patients with T2DM, but likely given a common soil of insulin resistance/obesity and not from the severity of liver necroinflammation or fibrosis. Nevertheless, clinicians should consider screening patients with T2DM and NAFLD for hypogonadism."
https://openalex.org/W3013241172,"Using an own survey on wage expectations among students at two Swiss institutions of higher education, we examine the wage expectations of our respondents along two main lines. First, we investigate the rationality of wage expectations by comparing average expected wages from our sample with those of similar graduates; further, we examine how our respondents revise their expectations when provided information about actual wages. Second, using causal mediation analysis, we test whether the consideration of a rich set of personal and professional controls, inclusive of preferences on family formation and number of children in addition to professional preferences, accounts for the difference in wage expectations across genders. Results suggest that both males and females overestimate their wages compared to actual ones and that males respond in an overconfident manner to information about realized wages. Personal mediators alone cannot explain the indirect effect of gender on wage expectations; however, when combined with professional mediators, this results in a quantitatively large reduction in the unexplained effect of gender on wage expectations. Nonetheless, a non-negligible and statistically significant direct (or unexplained) effect of gender on wage expectations remains in several, but not all specifications."
https://openalex.org/W3164513760,"Once an obscure pathogen, Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a significant global public health concern. Several studies have linked ZIKV infection in pregnant women with the development of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities, emphasizing the need for a safe and effective vaccine to combat the spread of this disease. Preclinical studies and vaccine development efforts have largely focused on the role of humoral immunity in disease protection. Consequently, relatively little is known in regard to cellular immunity against ZIKV, although an effective vaccine will likely need to engage both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. To that end, we utilized two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to identify 90 ZIKV peptides that were naturally processed and presented on HLA class I and II molecules (HLA-A*02:01/HLA-DRB1*04:01) of an immortalized B cell line infected with ZIKV (strain PRVABC59). Sequence identity clustering was used to filter the number of candidate peptides prior to evaluating memory T cell recall responses in ZIKV convalescent subjects. Peptides that individually elicited broad (4 of 7 subjects) and narrow (1 of 7 subjects) T cell responses were further analyzed using a suite of predictive algorithms and in silico modeling to evaluate HLA binding and peptide structural properties. A subset of nine broadly reactive peptides was predicted to provide robust global population coverage (97.47% class I; 70.74% class II) and to possess stable structural properties amenable for vaccine formulation, highlighting the potential clinical benefit for including ZIKV T cell epitopes in experimental vaccine formulations."
https://openalex.org/W3164336333,"Atopic dermatitis is a common skin disease characterized by altered cutaneous immunity in which patients often exhibit lower skin microbiota diversity compared to healthy skin and are prone to colonization by Staphylococcus aureus. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to have antibacterial effects; however, its effects on the skin microbiome have not previously been well-described.We aimed to examine the effects of topical dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on Staphylococcus aureus abundance, skin bacterial microbiome composition, and skin bacterial microbiome diversity in atopic dermatitis participants compared to healthy skin.Eleven subjects with atopic dermatitis and 11 healthy controls were enrolled in this randomized, non-blinded, single-institution, split-arm pilot study. Subjects soaked one forearm in dilute apple cider vinegar (0.5% acetic acid) and the other forearm in tap water for 10 minutes daily. Skin bacteria samples were collected from subjects' volar forearms before and after 14 days of treatment. 16S sequencing was used to analyze Staphylococcus aureus abundance and skin bacterial microbiome composition, and alpha diversity of microbiota were determined using Shannon diversity index.There was no difference in skin bacterial microbiome in atopic dermatitis subjects after 2 weeks of daily water or apple cider vinegar treatments (p = 0.056 and p = 0.22, respectively), or in mean abundance of S. aureus on apple cider vinegar-treated forearms (p = 0.60). At 2 weeks, the skin bacterial microbiomes of healthy control subjects were not significantly different from the skin bacterial microbiome of atopic dermatitis subjects (p = 0.14, 0.21, 0.12, and 0.05).Our results suggest that daily soaks in 0.5% apple cider vinegar are not an effective method of altering the skin bacterial microbiome in atopic dermatitis. Further studies are needed to explore the effects of different concentrations of apple cider vinegar on skin microflora and disease severity.UVA IRB-HSR #19906."
https://openalex.org/W3164343606,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are at increased risk of developing drug therapy problems (DTPs). The patients had a variety of comorbidities and complications, and they were given multiple medications. Medication therapy management (MTM) is a distinct service or group of services that optimize therapeutic outcomes for individual patients. The study assessed the impact of provision of MTM service on selected clinical and humanistic outcomes of diabetes patients at the diabetes mellitus clinic of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH).A pre-post interventional study design was carried out at DM clinic from July 2018 to April 2019. The intervention package included identifying and resolving drug therapy problems, counseling patients in person at the clinic or through telephone calls, and providing educational materials for six months. This was followed by four months of post-intervention assessment of clinical outcomes, DTPs, and treatment satisfaction. The interventions were provided by pharmacist in collaboration with physician and nurse. The study included all adult patients who had been diagnosed for diabetes (both type I & II) and had been taking anti-diabetes medications for at least three months. Patients with gestational diabetes, those who decided to change their follow-up clinic, and those who refused to participate in the study were excluded. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Descriptive statistics, t-test, and logistic regressions were performed for data analyses.Of the 423 enrolled patients, 409 fulfilled the criteria and included in the final data analysis. The intervention showed a decrease in average hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 0.92%, 25.04 mg/dl, and 6.62 mmHg, respectively (p<0.05). The prevalence of DTPs in the pre- and post-intervention of MTM services was found to be 72.9% and 26.2%, respectively (p<0.001). The overall mean score of treatment satisfaction was 90.1(SD, 11.04). Diabetes patients of age below 40 years (92.84 (SD, 9.54)), type-I DM (93.04 (SD, 9.75)) & being on one medication regimen (93.13(SD, 9.17)) had higher satisfaction score (p<0.05).Provision of MTM service had a potential to reduce DTPs, improve the clinical parameters, and treatment satisfaction in the post-intervention compared to the pre-intervention phase."
https://openalex.org/W3164382481,"Torque teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous non-pathogenic virus, which is suppressed in immunological healthy individuals but replicates in immune compromised patients. Thus, TTV load is a suitable biomarker for monitoring the immunosuppression also in lung transplant recipients. Since little is known about the changes of TTV load in lung cancer patients, we analyzed TTV plasma DNA levels in lung cancer patients and its perioperative changes after lung cancer surgery.Patients with lung cancer and non-malignant nodules as control group were included prospectively. TTV DNA levels were measured by quantiative PCR using DNA isolated from patients plasma and correlated with routine circulating biomarkers and clinicopathological variables.47 patients (early stage lung cancer n = 30, stage IV lung cancer n = 10, non-malignant nodules n = 7) were included. TTV DNA levels were not detected in seven patients (15%). There was no significant difference between the stage IV cases and the preoperative TTV plasma DNA levels in patients with early stage lung cancer or non-malignant nodules (p = 0.627). While gender, tumor stage and tumor histology showed no correlation with TTV load patients below 65 years of age had a significantly lower TTV load then older patients (p = 0.022). Regarding routine blood based biomarkers, LDH activity was significantly higher in patients with stage IV lung cancer (p = 0.043), however, TTV load showed no correlation with LDH activity, albumin, hemoglobin, CRP or WBC. Comparing the preoperative, postoperative and discharge day TTV load, no unequivocal pattern in the kinetics were.Our study suggest that lung cancer has no stage dependent impact on TTV plasma DNA levels and confirms that elderly patients have a significantly higher TTV load. Furthermore, we found no uniform perioperative changes during early stage lung cancer resection on plasma TTV DNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W3164712958,"Mucosal healing (MH) is a key treatment target in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is defined in endoscopic terms by the newly published PICaSSO score. Raman Spectroscopy (RS) is based on the scattering of inelastic light giving spectra that are highly specific for individual molecules. We aimed to establish spectral changes before and after treatment and whether Raman Spectroscopy is able to accurately differentiate between inflammation and MH.Biopsies were taken for ex vivo RS analysis alongside biopsies for histological analysis from IBD patients undergoing optical diagnosis endoscopic assessment. We compared pre- vs. post-biological treatment in IBD patients and healthy controls and active vs. MH in UC and CD. For spectral analysis, we used supervised self-organising maps for separation and classification.A total of 23 patients (14 IBD, 9 HC) were recruited for comparison of pre- vs. post-biologic treatment and 74 IBD patients were included for the assessment of MH in IBD, giving 9700 Raman Spectra. Spectral differences were seen between pre- and post-treatment which were observed comparing MH vs. active inflammation. Reductions in intensity at 1003cm-1 and 1252cm-1 when a reduction in inflammation was seen post-treatment and when MH was present. MH was associated with an increase in intensity at 1304cm-1. The trained neural network differentiated MH from active inflammation with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy in UC of 96.29% (sd 0.94), 95.03% (sd 1.52), 94.89% (sd 1.59), 96.33 (sd 0.97) and 95.65 (sd 0.99) and 96.19% (sd 1.46), 88% (sd 4.20), 86.60% (sd 5.39), 96.55% (sd 1.32) and 91.6% (sd 2.75) in CD respectively.We demonstrated RS can demonstrate biochemical changes following treatment of IBD and accurately differentiates MH from active inflammation in IBD and might be a future tool to personalise therapeutic management in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W3165142019,"Introduction Many countries with weaker health systems are struggling to put together a coherent strategy against the COVID-19 epidemic. We explored COVID-19 control strategies that could offer the greatest benefit in resource limited settings. Methods Using an age-structured SEIR model, we explored the effects of COVID-19 control interventions–a lockdown, physical distancing measures, and active case finding (testing and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine)–implemented individually and in combination to control a hypothetical COVID-19 epidemic in Kathmandu (population 2.6 million), Nepal. Results A month-long lockdown will delay peak demand for hospital beds by 36 days, as compared to a base scenario of no intervention (peak demand at 108 days (IQR 97-119); a 2 month long lockdown will delay it by 74 days, without any difference in annual mortality, or healthcare demand volume. Year-long physical distancing measures will reduce peak demand to 36% (IQR 23%-46%) and annual morality to 67% (IQR 48%-77%) of base scenario. Following a month long lockdown with ongoing physical distancing measures and an active case finding intervention that detects 5% of the daily infection burden could reduce projected morality and peak demand by more than 99%. Conclusion Limited resource settings are best served by a combination of early and aggressive case finding with ongoing physical distancing measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A lockdown may be helpful until combination interventions can be put in place but is unlikely to reduce annual mortality or healthcare demand."
https://openalex.org/W3165558045,"In this paper, we consider Dagum distribution which is capable of modeling various shapes of failure rates and aging criteria. Based on progressively type-I interval censoring data, we first obtain the maximum likelihood estimators and the approximate confidence intervals of the unknown parameters of the Dagum distribution. Next, we obtain the Bayes estimators of the parameters of Dagum distribution under the squared error loss (SEL) and balanced squared error loss (BSEL) functions using independent informative gamma and non informative uniform priors for both scale and two shape parameters. A Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to assess the performance of the proposed Bayes estimators with the maximum likelihood estimators. We also compute credible intervals and symmetric 100(1 - τ)% two-sided Bayes probability intervals under the respective approaches. Besides, based on observed samples, Bayes predictive estimates and intervals are obtained using one-and two-sample schemes. Simulation results reveal that the Bayes estimates based on SEL and BSEL performs better than maximum likelihood estimates in terms of bias and MSEs. Besides, credible intervals have smaller interval lengths than confidence interval. Further, predictive estimates based on SEL with informative prior performs better than non-informative prior for both one and two sample schemes. Further, the optimal censoring scheme has been suggested using a optimality criteria. Finally, we analyze a data set to illustrate the results derived."
https://openalex.org/W3165638625,"The diversity of Indochinese prawns in genus Macrobrachium is enormous due to the habitat diversification and broad tributary networks of two river basins: the Chao Phraya and the Mekong. Despite long-standing interest in SE-Asian decapod diversity, the subregional Macrobrachium fauna is still not yet comprehensively clarified in terms of taxonomic identification or genetic diversification. In this study, integrative taxonomic approaches including morphological examination, DNA barcoding, and molecular species delimitation were used to emphasize the broad scale systematics of Macrobrachium prawns in Indochina. Twenty-seven nominal species were successfully re-verified by traditional and molecular taxonomy. Barcode gap analysis supported broad overlapping of species boundaries. Taxonomic ambiguity of several deposited samples in the public database is related to inter- and intraspecific genetic divergence as indicated by BOLD discordance. Diagnostic nucleotide positions were found in six Macrobrachium species. Eighteen additional putative lineages are herein assigned using the consensus of species delimitation methods. Genetic divergence indicates the possible existence of cryptic species in four morphologically complex and wide-ranging species: M . lanchesteri , M . niphanae , M . sintangense , and some members of the M . pilimanus group. The geographical distribution of some species supports the connections and barriers attributed to paleo-historical events of SE-Asian rivers and land masses. Results of this study show explicitly the importance of freshwater ecosystems in Indochinese subregions, especially for the Mekong River Basin due to its high genetic diversity and species composition found throughout its tributaries."
https://openalex.org/W3165656542,"Since China's reform and opening-up in 1978, the income of rural residents has increased when compared with that of urban residents. However, the income growth rate of farmers is relatively low, and the income gap between urban and rural areas is widening. Using a sample of 1,325 large-scale farming households in Lin'an, this study constructs a theoretical path for how the level of vertical integration and an organization model affect farmers' income levels and empirically tests the path using a mediation effect analysis model. The results indicate that organization models and vertical integration are important factors that affect farmers' income levels. The total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who participate in agricultural operation organizations are greater than that of farmers who do not participate in an operation organization. In addition, the total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who produce and process and those who produce, process, and sell are higher than those of farmers who only produce. A farmers' organization model has both a direct and an indirect positive influence on their income level, with the indirect positive influence coming through the mediating variable of vertical integration. The application of the organizational model can promote the growth of rural households' total family income and agricultural income by 13.48% and 14.48% respectively, consisting of direct increases of 9.67% and 10.19%, and indirect increases of 3.81% and 4.29% through vertical integration. The results also show that access to credit, agricultural technology training, and the farmer's education level have significant positive impacts on farming income levels. The findings suggest ways to increase farmers' income by perfecting agricultural management organization systems, promoting agricultural industrialization, strengthening rural financial support, improving agricultural technical training for farmers, and increasing their level of education."

The results show that nationally, both traffic control and social distancing have played an important role in controlling the outbreak of the epidemic, however, neither of the two measures have had a significant effect in low-risk areas. Moreover, the effect of traffic control is more successful than that of social distancing. Both measures complement each other, and their combined effect achieves even better results. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the measures currently in place in China, however, we would like to emphasize that control measures should be more tailored, which implemented according to each specific city’s situation, in order to achieve a better epidemic prevention and control."
https://openalex.org/W3165783566,"Varroa mites (Varroa destructor) are parasitic mites that, combined with other factors, are contributing to high levels of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony losses. A Varroa-active dsRNA was recently developed to control Varroa mites within honey bee brood cells. This dsRNA has 372 base pairs that are homologous to a sequence region within the Varroa mite calmodulin gene (cam). The Varroa-active dsRNA also shares a 21-base pair match with monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) calmodulin mRNA, raising the possibility of non-target effects if there is environmental exposure. We chronically exposed the entire monarch larval stage to common (Asclepias syriaca) and tropical (Asclepias curassavica) milkweed leaves treated with concentrations of Varroa-active dsRNA that are one- and ten-fold higher than those used to treat honey bee hives. This corresponded to concentrations of 0.025-0.041 and 0.211-0.282 mg/g leaf, respectively. Potassium arsenate and a previously designed monarch-active dsRNA with a 100% base pair match to the monarch v-ATPase A mRNA (leaf concentration was 0.020-0.034 mg/g) were used as positive controls. The Varroa mite and monarch-active dsRNA's did not cause significant differences in larval mortality, larval or pupal development, pupal weights, or adult eclosion rates when compared to negative controls. Irrespective of control or dsRNA treatment, larvae that consumed approximately 7500 to 10,500-mg milkweed leaf within 10 to 12 days had the highest pupal weights. The lack of mortality and sublethal effects following dietary exposure to dsRNA with 21-base pair and 100% base pair match to mRNAs that correspond to regulatory genes suggest monarch mRNA may be refractory to silencing by dsRNA or monarch dsRNase may degrade dsRNA to a concentration that is insufficient to silence mRNA signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3164135246,"Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes have been implemented worldwide to raise revenue and reduce consumption of SSBs, which is associated with health harms. Empirical evaluations have found that these taxes are successful at reducing demand for SSBs; however, SSB taxes face opposition, in part because of claims that they will lead to substantial job losses. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the San Francisco SSB tax, implemented on January 1st, 2018, on employment.Monthly employment counts were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from January 2013 (5-years pre-tax) through December 2019 (2-years post-tax) for the overall economy, private sector, supermarkets and other grocery stores, convenience stores, limited-service restaurants, and beverage manufacturing. A synthetic control analysis was conducted for each employment outcome. The synthetic controls (i.e., estimated counterfactuals) were generated from a pool of urban control counties using pre-tax labor market-related characteristics.The synthetic controls had similar labor market-related characteristics and employment outcomes to those in San Francisco in the pre-tax period. Up to 2 years post-tax, differences in employment between San Francisco and the synthetic controls were small and not ""statistically significant"" based on placebo tests for all employment outcomes.Up to two years post-tax, we do not find evidence that the San Francisco SSB tax negatively impacted net employment, employment in the private sector, or employment in specific SSB-related industries."
https://openalex.org/W3164450336,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the primary motor cortex (MI) is expected to provide a therapeutic impact on spinal cord injury (SCI). On the other hand, treatment with antibody against repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) has been shown to ameliorate motor deficits after SCI in rodents and primates. Facilitating activity of the corticospinal tract (CST) by rTMS following rewiring of CST fibers by anti-RGMa antibody treatment may exert an enhanced effect on motor recovery in a primate model of SCI. To address this issue, we examined whether such a combined therapeutic strategy could contribute to accelerating functional restoration from SCI. In our SCI model, unilateral lesions were made between the C6 and the C7 level. Two macaque monkeys were used for each of the combined therapy and antibody treatment alone, while one monkey was for rTMS alone. The antibody treatment was continuously carried out for four weeks immediately after SCI, and rTMS trials applying a thermoplastic mask and a laser distance meter lasted ten weeks. Behavioral assessment was performed over 14 weeks after SCI to investigate the extent to which motor functions were restored with the antibody treatment and/or rTMS. While rTMS without the preceding antibody treatment produced no discernible sign for functional recovery, a combination of the antibody and rTMS exhibited a greater effect, especially at an early stage of rTMS trials, on restoration of dexterous hand movements. The present results indicate that rTMS combined with anti-RGMa antibody treatment may exert a synergistic effect on motor recovery from SCI."
https://openalex.org/W3165171006,"Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) comprise a rare and heterogenous group of cancers, for which the role of radiation therapy continues to evolve. The purpose of this study is to analyze oncologic outcomes after the use of high-dose radiation in management of NENs at a tertiary hospital.We performed a retrospective review of patients who received high-dose radiation with intent to cure or provide durable local control (defined as biologically effective dose (BED) ≥40, α/β = 10) for a localized or metastatic NEN from 2006 to 2019. Evaluation of disease status after radiation was performed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria when possible. Patients were grouped by differentiation (well-differentiated (WD) or poorly-differentiated (PD)) and stage (localized/locally advanced disease (L) or metastatic (M)) in analysis of probabilities of progression after radiation.45 patients completed a radiation course with BED ≥40 for a NEN (median BED 72). With a median follow-up of 24 months after radiation, the 2-year actuarial rates of local relapse-free survival, new metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival after radiation were 98%, 45%, 41%, and 69%, respectively. 25 patients (56%) developed new metastases after completion of radiation, including 33% (n = 3) of patients with WD-L disease, 44% (n = 8) of WD-M, 77% (n = 10) of PD-L, and 80% (n = 4) of PD-M, with progressively shorter median times to progression (26, 9, 8, and 3 months, respectively; p = 0.093). Of the 25 patients evaluable by RECIST, 68% (n = 17) achieved either a complete or partial best response in the irradiated lesion.These data suggest that focal, high-dose radiation has a role in the management of selected patients with NENs. Local failure is rare in patients with both well-differentiated and poorly-differentiated disease, although the predominant pattern of failure remains development of new metastases."

https://openalex.org/W3165614179,"Rabies is a viral disease of animals and people causing fatal encephalomyelitis if left untreated. Although effective pre- and post-exposure vaccines exist, they are not widely available in many endemic countries within Africa. Since many individuals in these countries remain at risk of infection, post-exposure healthcare-seeking behaviors are crucial in preventing infection and warrant examination.A rabies knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey was conducted at 24 geographically diverse sites in Uganda during 2013 to capture information on knowledge concerning the disease, response to potential exposure events, and vaccination practices. Characteristics of the surveyed population and of the canine-bite victim sub-population were described. Post-exposure healthcare-seeking behaviors of canine-bite victims were examined and compared to the related healthcare-seeking attitudes of non-bite victim respondents. Wealth scores were calculated for each household, rabies knowledge was scored for each non-bitten survey respondent, and rabies exposure risk was scored for each bite victim. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent associations between different variables and healthcare-seeking behaviors among canine-bite victims as well as attitudes of non-bitten study respondents.A total of 798 households were interviewed, capturing 100 canine-bite victims and a bite incidence of 2.3 per 100 person-years. Over half of bite victims actively sought medical treatment (56%), though very few received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (3%). Bite victims who did not know or report the closest location where PEP could be received were less likely to seek medical care (p = 0.05). Respondents who did not report having been bitten by a dog with higher knowledge scores were more likely to respond that they would both seek medical care (p = 0.00) and receive PEP (p = 0.06) after a potential rabies exposure event.There was varying discordance between what respondents who did not report having been bitten by a dog said they would do if bitten by a dog when compared to the behaviors exhibited by canine-bite victims captured in the KAP survey. Bite victims seldom elected to wash their wound or receive PEP. Having lower rabies knowledge was a barrier to theoretically seeking care and receiving PEP among not bitten respondents, indicating a need for effective and robust educational programs in the country."

Erythropoietin is elevated in fetal hypoxia but is also a potential neuroprotectant.In a prospective study of 27 infants ≤ 30 weeks gestation, serum erythropoietin concentrations were measured during the first month of life, on day 1 and weeks 1, 2, and 4, and related to perinatal risk factors and outcomes including retinopathy of prematurity and cerebral injury evaluated near term-equivalent post menstrual age using magnetic resonance imaging with quantitative scoring.Lower birth weight was associated with higher EPO concentrations throughout the first 2 weeks of life (r = -0.6, p < 0.01). Higher day 1 and week 1 EPO concentrations were associated with lower Apgar score at 1 minute (r = - 0.5) and 5 minutes (r = -0.7), respectively (p < 0.01). Higher day 1 EPO concentrations and 2-week area under the curve were associated with increased risk (p = 0.01) and severity (r = 0.5, p < 0.02) of retinopathy of prematurity. Higher EPO concentrations at 2 weeks were associated with increased total brain injury score (r = 0.5, p < 0.05).Elevated endogenous erythropoietin concentrations in the first two weeks of life are associated with lower birth weight and increased risk of adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3164154739,"Health care professionals regularly struggle with issues relating to confidentiality and consent for physical and/or mental health issues among adolescents. We investigate late adolescents' own and assumed parental preferences towards health-care related confidentiality and consent.We analyzed online survey data of four vignettes from 463 first-year university students at KU Leuven (Flanders, Belgium). We used paired samples t-tests to assess the (in)consistency between attitudes of late adolescents and their assumed parental attitudes, independent samples t-tests to estimate gender differences, and binomial logistic regressions to analyze the association of assumed parental preferences with late adolescents' own preferences.Attitudinal inconsistencies were present in all vignettes. Late adolescents were significantly more in favor of confidentiality and adolescent consent than what they believed their parents were. Gender differences were limited. Binomial logistic regressions indicated that assumed parental preferences were strongly associated with late adolescents' own preferences.Findings suggest a clear difference between late adolescents' preferences and assumed parental preferences: they believe that their parents are less inclined to favor confidentiality and adolescent consent. We also find that this difference depends on the case, indicating that there is no such thing as general 'confidentiality preferences'. Rather, a decision- and/or context-specific perspective should be adopted."
https://openalex.org/W3164412378,"Tumor angiogenesis is critical for the growth and progression of cancer. As such, angiostasis is a treatment modality for cancer with potential utility for multiple types of cancer and fewer side effects. However, clinical success of angiostatic monotherapies has been moderate, at best, causing angiostatic treatments to lose their early luster. Previous studies demonstrated compensatory mechanisms that drive tumor vascularization despite the use of angiostatic monotherapies, as well as the potential for combination angiostatic therapies to overcome these compensatory mechanisms. We screened clinically approved angiostatics to identify specific combinations that confer potent inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis. We used a novel modification of the ex ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model that combined confocal and automated analyses to quantify tumor angiogenesis induced by glioblastoma tumor onplants. This model is advantageous due to its low cost and moderate throughput capabilities, while maintaining complex in vivo cellular interactions that are difficult to replicate in vitro. After screening multiple combinations, we determined that glioblastoma-induced angiogenesis was significantly reduced using a combination of bevacizumab (Avastin®) and temsirolimus (Torisel®) at doses below those where neither monotherapy demonstrated activity. These preliminary results were verified extensively, with this combination therapy effective even at concentrations further reduced 10-fold with a CI value of 2.42E-5, demonstrating high levels of synergy. Thus, combining bevacizumab and temsirolimus has great potential to increase the efficacy of angiostatic therapy and lower required dosing for improved clinical success and reduced side effects in glioblastoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W3165064799,"Faced with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, and to better understand and contain the disease’s spread, health organisations increased the collaboration with other organisations sharing health data with data scientists and researchers. Data analysis assists such organisations in providing information that could help in decision-making processes. For this purpose, both national and regional health authorities provided health data for further processing and analysis. Shared data must comply with existing data protection and privacy regulations. Therefore, a robust de-identification procedure must be used, and a re-identification risk analysis should also be performed. De-identified data embodies state-of-the-art approaches in Data Protection by Design and Default because it requires the protection of direct and indirect identifiers (not just direct). This article highlights the importance of assessing re-identification risk before data disclosure by analysing a data set of individuals infected by Covid-19 that was made available for research purposes. We stress that it is highly important to make this data available for research purposes and that this process should be based on the state of the art methods in Data Protection by Design and by Default. Our main goal is to consider different re-identification risk analysis scenarios since the information on the intruder side is unknown. Our conclusions show that there is a risk of identity disclosure for all of the studied scenarios. For one, in particular, we proceed to an example of a re-identification attack. The outcome of such an attack reveals that it is possible to identify individuals with no much effort."

Several organizations recommend that individuals who are HCV infected, as well as persons over the age of 13, should be HIV tested. Comorbidities associated with HCV can be reduced with early identification of HIV. Our objective was to determine whether providers routinely followed HIV testing guidelines for patients who tested HCV positive (HCV+).A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients in primary care at an academic health system from 7/2015-3/2017 who tested HCV+. As part of a primary database, HCV testing data was collected; HIV testing data was abstracted manually. We collected and described the intervals between HCV and HIV tests. To determine associations with HIV testing univariable and multivariable analyses were performed.We identified 445 patients who tested HCV+: 56.6% were tested for HIV, the mean age was 57 ± 10.9 years, 77% were from the Birth Cohort born 1945-1965 (BC); 61% were male; and 51% were Black/AA. Patients in the BC were more likely to be HIV tested if they were: male (p = 0.019), Black/AA (p<0.001), and had Medicaid (p = 0.005). These differences were not found in the non-BC. Six patients who were tested for both HIV and HCV were found to be newly HIV positive at the time of testing.As demonstrated, providers did not routinely follow CDC recommendations as almost half of the HCV+ patients were not correctly tested for HIV. It is important to emphasize that six persons were tested HIV positive simultaneously with their HCV+ diagnosis. If providers did not follow the CDC guidelines, then these patients may not have been identified. Improvements in EHR clinical decision support tools and provider education can help improve the HIV testing rate among individuals who are HCV+."

Despite scattered fossil reports, the cashew genus Anacardium offers an excellent example of such migration. The fossil woods described here come from localities in Veraguas, Panama mapped as Oligocene-Miocene. We studied, described, and identified two well-preserved specimens using wood anatomical characteristics and completed extensive comparisons between fossil and extant material. The studied fossil woods share several diagnostic features with the modern Anacardium genus, including large solitary vessels, large intervessel-pitting, a simple vessel-ray pitting pattern, and mostly 1-3 seriate rays with large rhomboidal solitary crystals. We propose a new fossil species named Anacardium gassonii sp. nov., that adds an essential piece to the understanding of the historical biogeography of the genus. In addition, our findings confirm previous interpretations of this species' migration from Europe to North America and its crossing through Panama, leading to subsequent diversification in South America. This discovery provides an important link to the historical migration patterns of the genus, supporting the notion of an Eocene migration to the Neotropics via Boreotropical bridges, as well as an Oligocene-Miocene crossing of Central America followed by diversification in South America."
https://openalex.org/W3165711856,"Bioturbation involves the incorporation of residues from the surface soil into the subsoil; however, common small soil 'bioengineers', such as earthworms or termites, are unlikely to transport human artifacts to deeper soil horizons. However, such artifacts occur in the deeper soil horizons within Amazonian Anthrosols (Terra Preta). Here we test the assumption that such tasks could be carried out by fly larvae, which could thus play a crucial role in waste decomposition and associated soil mixing under tropical conditions. We performed two greenhouse experiments with sandy substrate covered with layers of organic waste, ceramic fragments, and black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) (Hermetia illucens (L.) (Dipt.: Stratiomyidae)). We used in-situ images to assess the rate of bioturbation by BSFL, and then designed our main study to observe waste dissipation (reduction of organic carbon and phosphorus contents from waste model trials with and without charcoal) as related to larval-induced changes in soil properties. We found that the bioturbation of macroinvertebrates like BSFL was able to bury even large (> 5 cm) ceramic fragments within hours, which coincided with high soil growth rates (0.5 cm h-1). The sandy soil was subsequently heavily enriched with organic matter and phosphorus originating from organic waste. We conclude that BSFL, and possibly other fly species, are important, previously overlooked soil 'bioengineers', which may even contribute to the burial of artifacts in Anthrosols and other terrestrial waste dumps."
https://openalex.org/W3164178551,"Breast cancer cells were reported to up-regulate human prolactin receptor (PRLR) to assist their growth through the utilization of prolactin (PRL) as the growth factor, which makes PRLR a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. On the other hand, advanced cancer cells tend to down-regulate or shed off stress signal proteins to evade immune surveillance and elimination. In this report, we created a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of MHC class I chain-related protein (MICA), a stress signal protein and ligand of the activating receptor NKG2D of natural killer (NK) cells, and G129R, an antagonistic variant of PRL. We hypothesize that the MICA portion of the fusion protein binds to NKG2D to activate NK cells and the G129R portion binds to PRLR on breast cancer cells, so that the activated NK cells will kill the PRLR-positive breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that the MICA-G129R fusion protein not only binds to human natural killer NK-92 cells and PRLR-positive human breast cancer T-47D cells, but also promotes NK cells to release granzyme B and IFN-γ and enhances the cytotoxicity of NK cells specifically on PRLR-positive cells. The fusion protein, therefore, represents a new approach for the development of breast cancer specific immunotherapy."

This study aimed to investigate changes in VO2 max and anthropometric parameters after 12 weeks without mandatory physical training in naval cadets. The sample was 38 healthy and physically active naval cadets. The measured variables, including VO2 max and anthropometric parameters, were evaluated through the 12-minute race test (12MRT) and the somatotype. Both variables had a separation of 12 weeks without mandatory physical training. A t-test for related samples was used to evidence changes between the test and post-test; effect size was calculated through Cohen's d-test. Distance in 12MRT and VO2 max showed significant decreases at the end of 12 weeks without mandatory physical training (p < 0.001). Likewise, the tricipital skinfold thickness and the endomorphic component showed significant increases (p < 0.05). 12 weeks without mandatory physical training significantly reduces the VO2 max in naval cadets. Simultaneously, the same period without physical training increases both the tricipital skinfold thickness and the endomorphic component in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3164278239,"The ActiGraph and activPAL monitors are the most frequently used thigh-worn devices to measure motion and posture, but the criterion validity to measure sitting, standing and postural transfer in the office setting is not known. Research question: To examine the criterion validity of the ActiGraph and activPAL activity monitors in repeatedly measuring a variety of different postures and motion in the office setting.Twenty office workers from the University of Zurich wore an ActiGraph and activPAL during two identical laboratory experiments lasting approximately 60 minutes each, within a maximum of 7 days. The experimental setting consisted of a standard computer office workstation with an electrically powered height-adjustable desk, a swivel chair without arm rests, a standard chair, a footrest, and a bookcase. The protocol consisted of 24 pre-defined tasks mimicking sitting, standing, stepping, and postural transitions around the workplace. All tasks were supervised and observed by the same experimenter.In repeated measurements (40 individual experiments), the percentages of correctly classified tasks for the ActiGraph and activPAL were, respectively, 100% vs. 85% for sitting, 87% vs. 100% for standing, and 100% vs. 73% for postural transitions. Both monitors correctly identified all stepping tasks. The activPAL misclassified sitting with legs outstretched, and sitting with both feet placed beneath the chair, as standing ~25-70% and 45% of the time, respectively. The ActiGraph misclassified standing with the right foot on a footrest as sitting in 65% of events.The ActiGraph appears to be slightly more sensitive than the activPAL with respect to the measurement of sitting and postural transitions of short duration, whereas the activPAL seems to be slightly more accurate in capturing standing postures. This knowledge will help guide researchers to choose the best suitable monitor for their research setting."
https://openalex.org/W3164561256,"Family members remain the main care providers for the increasing numbers of people with dementia, and often become depressed or anxious. In an implementation research project, we aimed to widen access to Strategies for RelaTives (START), a clinically and cost-effective intervention for the mental health of family carers, by laying the foundations for its implementation in the third sector. We used the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to guide implementation of START, a manual-based, individually-delivered, multicomponent eight-session coping strategy intervention. We interviewed a maximum variation sample of twenty-seven stakeholders from the English Alzheimer's Society (AS), about possible difficulties in management, training, and delivery of START. We trained and supervised three AS dementia support workers in different locations, to each deliver START to three family carers. Two researchers independently coded pre-intervention interviews for themes. We assessed intervention feasibility through monitoring delivery fidelity, rating audio-recordings from 1-5 (5 being high) and interviewing facilitators, family carers and AS managers about their experiences. We assessed effectiveness on family carers' mental health using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before and after receiving START (scores 0-42). We changed START's format by reflecting carer diversity more and increasing carer stories prominence, but core content or delivery processes were unchanged. All carers received START and attended every session. The mean fidelity score was 4.2. Mean HADS-total score reduced from baseline 18.4 (standard deviation 7.4) to follow-up 15.8 (9.7). Six (67%) carers scored as clinically depressed on baseline HADS and 2 (22%) at follow-up. Facilitators and carers rated START positively. Appropriately experienced third sector workers can be trained and supervised to deliver START and it remains effective. This has the potential for widened access at scale."
https://openalex.org/W3165191969,"Electrical stimulation is one of the candidates for elongation-driven regeneration of damaged peripheral nerves. Different organs and tissues have an inherent cell structure and size. This leads to variation in the tissue-specific electrical properties of the frequency of interfacial polarization. Although nervous tissues have a membrane potential, the electrical reaction inside these tissues following electrical stimulation from outside remains unexplored. Furthermore, the pathophysiological reaction of an injured nerve is unclear. Here, we investigated the electrical reaction of injured and non-injured rat sciatic nerves via broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Crush injured and non-injured sciatic nerves of six 12-week-old male Lewis rats were used, 6 days after infliction of the injury. Both sides of the nerves (with and without injury) were exposed, and impedance measurements were performed at room temperature (approximately 25°C) at frequencies ranging from 100 mHz to 5.5 MHz and electric potential ranging from 0.100 to 1.00 V. The measured interfacial polarization potentially originated from the polarization by ion transport around nerve membranes at frequencies between 3.2 kHz and 1.6 MHz. The polarization strength of the injured nerves was smaller than that of non-injured nerves. However, the difference in polarization between injured and non-injured nerves might be caused by inflammation and edema. The suitable frequency range of the interfacial polarization can be expected to be critical for electrical stimulation of injured peripheral nerves."
https://openalex.org/W3165271322,"Genomic sequence analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii revealed the presence of a putative Acid Phosphatase (AcpA; EC 3.1.3.2). A plasmid construct was made, and recombinant protein (rAcpA) was expressed in E. coli. PAGE analysis (carried out under denaturing/reducing conditions) of nickel-affinity purified protein revealed the presence of a near-homogeneous band of approximately 37 kDa. The identity of the 37 kDa species was verified as rAcpA by proteomic analysis with a molecular mass of 34.6 kDa from the deduced sequence. The dependence of substrate hydrolysis on pH was broad with an optimum observed at 6.0. Kinetic analysis revealed relatively high affinity for PNPP (Km = 90 μM) with Vmax, kcat, and Kcat/Km values of 19.2 pmoles s-1, 4.80 s-1(calculated on the basis of 37 kDa), and 5.30 x 104 M-1s-1, respectively. Sensitivity to a variety of reagents, i.e., detergents, reducing, and chelating agents as well as classic acid phosphatase inhibitors was examined in addition to assessment of hydrolysis of a number of phosphorylated compounds. Removal of phosphate from different phosphorylated compounds is supportive of broad, i.e., 'nonspecific' substrate specificity; although, the enzyme appears to prefer phosphotyrosine and/or peptides containing phosphotyrosine in comparison to serine and threonine. Examination of the primary sequence indicated the absence of signature sequences characteristic of Type A, B, and C nonspecific bacterial acid phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W3165880456,"We report on an experimental study to investigate the sedimentation behaviour and rheological properties of extremely fine-grained calcite oozes. The experiments are aimed at clarifying if thixotropic behaviour may have played a role in the preservation of marine biota in plattenkalks of the Solnhofen lagoons of the Franconian Alb. Calcite particles with grain sizes from 2.2 to 4.4 μm were sedimented from water, seawater proxies, and hypersaline brines with up to 14 wt.% NaCl, for 170 days. High salinities as envisioned for the bottom waters of some Solnhofen lagoons slow down settling rates of calcite and may produce plattenkalks more porous and more friable than plattenkalks elsewhere in the Solnhofen archipelago. Rheological properties of calcite suspensions were measured with an oscillation rheometer. Calcite oozes with 40 vol.% calcite in suspension behave thixotropically regardless of the salinity of the pore solutions. Thixotropic behaviour may have the potential to promote the fossilisation of marine biota. Even if the sediment cover is thin, i.e. a few millimeters, a carcass covered by a thixotropic sediment would be largely isolated from the overlying water column because pore solutions in thixotropic media hardly communicate with the overlying water column. A fish carcass covered by a thixotropic sediment could impose local-scale physicochemical conditions on its direct sedimentary envelope favourable for preservation and the replacement of organic material by inorganic materials."
