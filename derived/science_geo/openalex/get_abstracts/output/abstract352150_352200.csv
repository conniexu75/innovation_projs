https://openalex.org/W2091901410,"Identifying variations in DNA that increase susceptibility to disease is one of the primary aims of genetic studies using a forward genetics approach. However, identification of disease-susceptibility genes by means of such studies provides limited functional information on how genes lead to disease. In fact, in most cases there is an absence of functional information altogether, preventing a definitive identification of the susceptibility gene or genes. Here we develop an alternative to the classic forward genetics approach for dissecting complex disease traits where, instead of identifying susceptibility genes directly affected by variations in DNA, we identify gene networks that are perturbed by susceptibility loci and that in turn lead to disease. Application of this method to liver and adipose gene expression data generated from a segregating mouse population results in the identification of a macrophage-enriched network supported as having a causal relationship with disease traits associated with metabolic syndrome. Three genes in this network, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), lactamase beta (Lactb) and protein phosphatase 1-like (Ppm1l), are validated as previously unknown obesity genes, strengthening the association between this network and metabolic disease traits. Our analysis provides direct experimental support that complex traits such as obesity are emergent properties of molecular networks that are modulated by complex genetic loci and environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W2006569015,"Intrinsic antioxidant defenses are important for neuronal longevity. We found that in rat neurons, synaptic activity, acting via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, boosted antioxidant defenses by making changes to the thioredoxin-peroxiredoxin (Prx) system. Synaptic activity enhanced thioredoxin activity, facilitated the reduction of overoxidized Prxs and promoted resistance to oxidative stress. Resistance was mediated by coordinated transcriptional changes; synaptic NMDAR activity inactivated a previously unknown Forkhead box O target gene, the thioredoxin inhibitor Txnip. Conversely, NMDAR blockade upregulated Txnip in vivo and in vitro, where it bound thioredoxin and promoted vulnerability to oxidative damage. Synaptic activity also upregulated the Prx reactivating genes Sesn2 (sestrin 2) and Srxn1 (sulfiredoxin), via C/EBPβ and AP-1, respectively. Mimicking these expression changes was sufficient to strengthen antioxidant defenses. Trans-synaptic stimulation of synaptic NMDARs was crucial for boosting antioxidant defenses; chronic bath activation of all (synaptic and extrasynaptic) NMDARs induced no antioxidative effects. Thus, synaptic NMDAR activity may influence the progression of pathological processes associated with oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2062395662,"A combination of targeted probes and new imaging technologies provides a powerful set of tools with the potential to improve the early detection of cancer. To develop a probe for detecting colon cancer, we screened phage display peptide libraries against fresh human colonic adenomas for high-affinity ligands with preferential binding to premalignant tissue. We identified a specific heptapeptide sequence, VRPMPLQ, which we synthesized, conjugated with fluorescein and tested in patients undergoing colonoscopy. We imaged topically administered peptide using a fluorescence confocal microendoscope delivered through the instrument channel of a standard colonoscope. In vivo images were acquired at 12 frames per second with 50-microm working distance and 2.5-microm (transverse) and 20-microm (axial) resolution. The fluorescein-conjugated peptide bound more strongly to dysplastic colonocytes than to adjacent normal cells with 81% sensitivity and 82% specificity. This methodology represents a promising diagnostic imaging approach for the early detection of colorectal cancer and potentially of other epithelial malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W2010486643,"The angiogenic sprout has been compared to the growing axon, and indeed, many proteins direct pathfinding by both structures1. The Roundabout (Robo) proteins are guidance receptors with well-established functions in the nervous system2,3; however, their role in the mammalian vasculature remains ill defined4,5,6,7,8. Here we show that an endothelial-specific Robo, Robo4, maintains vascular integrity. Activation of Robo4 by Slit2 inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165–induced migration, tube formation and permeability in vitro and VEGF-165–stimulated vascular leak in vivo by blocking Src family kinase activation. In mouse models of retinal and choroidal vascular disease, Slit2 inhibited angiogenesis and vascular leak, whereas deletion of Robo4 enhanced these pathologic processes. Our results define a previously unknown function for Robo receptors in stabilizing the vasculature and suggest that activating Robo4 may have broad therapeutic application in diseases characterized by excessive angiogenesis and/or vascular leak."

https://openalex.org/W2036132575,"Muscular dystrophies comprise a diverse group of genetic disorders that lead to muscle wasting and, in many instances, premature death. Many mutations that cause muscular dystrophy compromise the support network that connects myofilament proteins within the cell to the basal lamina outside the cell, rendering the sarcolemma more permeable or leaky. Here we show that deletion of the gene encoding cyclophilin D (Ppif) rendered mitochondria largely insensitive to the calcium overload-induced swelling associated with a defective sarcolemma, thus reducing myofiber necrosis in two distinct models of muscular dystrophy. Mice lacking delta-sarcoglycan (Scgd(-/-) mice) showed markedly less dystrophic disease in both skeletal muscle and heart in the absence of Ppif. Moreover, the premature lethality associated with deletion of Lama2, encoding the alpha-2 chain of laminin-2, was rescued, as were other indices of dystrophic disease. Treatment with the cyclophilin inhibitor Debio-025 similarly reduced mitochondrial swelling and necrotic disease manifestations in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and in Scgd(-/-) mice. Thus, mitochondrial-dependent necrosis represents a prominent disease mechanism in muscular dystrophy, suggesting that inhibition of cyclophilin D could provide a new pharmacologic treatment strategy for these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2025225219,"Tumour cells become addicted to the expression of initiating oncogenes like Ras, such that loss of oncogene expression in established tumours leads to tumour regression. HRas, NRas or KRas are mutated to remain in the active GTP-bound oncogenic state in many cancers. Although Ras activates several proteins to initiate human tumour growth, only PI3K, through activation of protein kinase B (PKB; also known as AKT), must remain activated by oncogenic Ras to maintain this growth. Here we show that blocking phosphorylation of the AKT substrate, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS or NOS3), inhibits tumour initiation and maintenance. Moreover, eNOS enhances the nitrosylation and activation of endogenous wild-type Ras proteins, which are required throughout tumorigenesis. We suggest that activation of the PI3K-AKT-eNOS-(wild-type) Ras pathway by oncogenic Ras in cancer cells is required to initiate and maintain tumour growth."
https://openalex.org/W2167543384,"Stem cells are thought to balance self-renewal and differentiation through asymmetric and symmetric divisions, but whether such divisions occur during hematopoietic development remains unknown. Using a Notch reporter mouse, in which GFP acts as a sensor for differentiation, we image hematopoietic precursors and show that they undergo both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. In addition we show that the balance between these divisions is not hardwired but responsive to extrinsic and intrinsic cues. Precursors in a prodifferentiation environment preferentially divide asymmetrically, whereas those in a prorenewal environment primarily divide symmetrically. Oncoproteins can also influence division pattern: although BCR-ABL predominantly alters the rate of division and death, NUP98-HOXA9 promotes symmetric division, suggesting that distinct oncogenes subvert different aspects of cellular function. These studies establish a system for tracking division of hematopoietic precursors and show that the balance of symmetric and asymmetric division can be influenced by the microenvironment and subverted by oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2002759367,"Treatment for schistosomiasis, which is responsible for more than 280,000 deaths annually, depends almost exclusively on praziquantel. Millions of people are treated annually with praziquantel, and drug-resistant parasites thus are likely to evolve. Phosphinic amides and oxadiazole 2-oxides, identified from a quantitative high-throughput screen, were shown to inhibit a parasite enzyme, thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), with activities in the low micromolar to low nanomolar range. Incubation of parasites with these compounds led to rapid inhibition of TGR activity and parasite death. The activity of the oxadiazole 2-oxides was associated with a donation of nitric oxide. Treatment of schistosome-infected mice with 4-phenyl-1,2,5-oxadiazole-3-carbonitrile-2-oxide led to marked reductions in worm burdens from treatments against multiple parasite stages and egg-associated pathologies. The compound was active against the three major schistosome species infecting humans. These protective effects exceed benchmark activity criteria set by the World Health Organization for lead compound development for schistosomiasis."

Here we redefined serotonergic subtypes on the basis of genetic programs that are differentially enacted in progenitor cells. We uncovered a molecular framework for the serotonergic system that, having genetic lineages as its basis, is likely to have physiological relevance and will permit access to genetically defined subtypes for manipulation."

https://openalex.org/W2032014604,"Neurodegeneration can be triggered by genetic or environmental factors. Although the precise cause is often unknown, many neurodegenerative diseases share common features such as protein aggregation and age dependence. Recent studies in Drosophila have uncovered protective effects of NAD synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) against activity-induced neurodegeneration and injury-induced axonal degeneration. Here we show that NMNAT overexpression can also protect against spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1)-induced neurodegeneration, suggesting a general neuroprotective function of NMNAT. It protects against neurodegeneration partly through a proteasome-mediated pathway in a manner similar to heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70). NMNAT displays chaperone function both in biochemical assays and cultured cells, and it shares significant structural similarity with known chaperones. Furthermore, it is upregulated in the brain upon overexpression of poly-glutamine expanded protein and recruited with the chaperone Hsp70 into protein aggregates. Our results implicate NMNAT as a stress-response protein that acts as a chaperone for neuronal maintenance and protection. Our studies provide an entry point for understanding how normal neurons maintain activity, and offer clues for the common mechanisms underlying different neurodegenerative conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2022208109,"The maintenance of genomic stability in cells is relentlessly challenged by environmental stresses that induce DNA breaks, which activate the DNA-damage pathway mediated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and its downstream mediators to control damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. Here, we show that FOXO3a interacts with ATM to promote phosphorylation of ATM at Ser 1981 and prompting its downstream mediators to form nuclear foci in response to DNA damage. Silencing FOXO3a in cells abrogates the formation of ATM-pS1981 and phospho-histone H2AX foci after DNA damage. Increasing FOXO3a in cells promotes ATM-regulated signalling, the intra-S-phase or G2-M cell-cycle checkpoints, and the repair of damaged DNA, whereas cells lacking FOXO3a did not trigger the DNA-repair mechanism after DNA damage. The carboxy-terminal domain of FOXO3a binds to the FAT domain of ATM, thereby contributing to the activation of ATM. These results suggest that ATM may be regulated directly by FOXO3a in the DNA-damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2047582243,"Mammalian Notch receptors contain 29–36 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats that may be modified by protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase 1 (Pofut1), an essential component of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. The <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue Ofut1 is proposed to function as both a chaperone required for stable cell surface expression of Notch and a protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase. Here we investigate these dual roles of Pofut1 in relation to endogenous Notch receptors of Chinese hamster ovary and murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. We show that fucosylation-deficient Lec13 Chinese hamster ovary cells have wild type levels of Pofut1 and cell surface Notch receptors. Nevertheless, they have reduced binding of Notch ligands and low levels of Delta1- and Jagged1-induced Notch signaling. Exogenous fucose but not galactose rescues both ligand binding and Notch signaling. Murine ES cells lacking Pofut1 also have wild type levels of cell surface Notch receptors. However, <i>Pofut1</i><sup>–/–</sup> ES cells do not bind Notch ligands or exhibit Notch signaling. Although overexpression of fucosyltransferase-defective Pofut1 R245A in <i>Pofut1</i><sup>–/–</sup> cells partially rescues ligand binding and Notch signaling, this effect is not specific. The same rescue is achieved by an unrelated, inactive, endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase. Therefore, mammalian Notch receptors require Pofut1 for the generation of optimally functional Notch receptors, but, in contrast to <i>Drosophila</i>, Pofut1 is not required for stable cell surface expression of Notch. Importantly, we also show that, under certain circumstances, mammalian Notch receptors are capable of signaling in the absence of Pofut1 and <i>O</i>-fucose."

https://openalex.org/W2034982562,"Gradients of secreted signaling proteins guide growing blood vessels during both normal and pathological angiogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which endothelial cells integrate and respond to graded distributions of chemotactic factors are still poorly understood. We have in this study investigated endothelial cell migration in response to hill-shaped gradients of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) using a novel microfluidic chemotaxis chamber (MCC). Cell migration was scored at the level of individual cells using time-lapse microscopy. A stable gradient of VEGFA165 ranging from 0 to 50 ng/ml over a distance of 400 μm was shown to strongly induce chemotaxis of endothelial cells of different vascular origin. VEGFA121, unable to bind proteoglycan and neuropilin coreceptors, was also shown to induce chemotaxis in this setup. Furthermore, a gradient of FGF2 was able to attract venular but not arterial endothelial cells, albeit less efficiently than VEGFA165. Notably, constant levels of VEGFA165, but not of FGF2, were shown to efficiently reduce chemokinesis. Systematic exploration of different gradient shapes led to the identification of a minimal gradient steepness required for efficient cell guidance. Finally, analysis of cell migration in different regions of the applied gradients showed that chemotaxis is reduced when cells reach the high end of the gradient. Our findings suggest that chemotactic growth factor gradients may instruct endothelial cells to shift toward a nonmigratory phenotype when approaching the growth factor source.

Our findings suggest that chemotactic growth factor gradients may instruct endothelial cells to shift toward a nonmigratory phenotype when approaching the growth factor source. Many cells in developing organs and tissues have the capacity to detect extracellular chemical gradients and to respond to these gradients by directed positive or negative migration, a process called chemotaxis. In addition, some factors may also regulate chemokinesis which refers to nondirectional cell migration. Directed cell migration is at the heart of embryonic blood vessel formation, where the growing vessels navigate by a combination of secreted chemoattractants and repellents. The leading front of the embryonic vascular sprout holds a tip cell with numerous filopodia that express receptors for sensing secreted and cell-bound guidance cues provided by surrounding cells (1Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). One of the most well studied factors that control blood vessel formation and function is vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) 2The abbreviations used are: VEGFA, vascular endothelial growth factor A; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; HUAEC, human umbilical artery endothelial cell; MCC, microfluidic chemotaxis chamber; PDMS, polydimethyl siloxane; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.

The effects of VEGFA on endothelial cells have been intensely studied for many years in an array of different model systems (4Olsson A.K. Dimberg A. Kreuger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

However, the ability to generate and maintain stable gradients of soluble factors compatible with cell culture conditions was only recently made possible by the invention of a microfluidic chemotaxis chamber (MCC). Chemotaxis of several cell types, including neutrophils and cancer cells, have been successfully studied in MCCs, but the method has so far not been used to systematically study endothelial cell migration in gradients of chemotactic factors (10Jeon N.L.

Li Jeon N. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a receptor for VEGFA and essential for endothelial cell differentiation and migration (12Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). VEGFA exists in several isoforms that bind with different affinities to VEGFRs and their coreceptors, neuropilins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). VEGFA165 is thought to be the most abundantly expressed splice form with the capacity to interact both with neuropilins and HSPGs, whereas the shorter splice form VEGFA121 does not interact with HSPGs or neuropilins (13Ashikari-Hada S.

Interactions between VEGFA165 and HSPG coreceptors are required for proper gradient formation in tissues, and these interactions probably also influence the kinetics and the quality of VEGFR2 signaling (13Ashikari-Hada S.

However, it has been rather difficult to record long range gradients of VEGFA165 similar to what has been shown for morphogens in various model systems (14Ruhrberg C. Gerhardt H. Golding M. Watson R.

In addition to being presented as a gradient, secreted VEGFA165 sometimes seems to form a “path” over which endothelial cells migrate, as has been convincingly shown in the developing mouse retina (1Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is a wide spectrum angiogenic factor shown to induce survival and proliferation as well as migration of endothelial cells both in vivo and in vitro (20Poole T.J. Finkelstein E.B. Cox C.M. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21Cox C.M. Poole T.J. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). FGF2 is a ligand for FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and FGF receptor 2. The literature so far provides diverse reports on the effects of FGF2 on endothelial cell chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Endothelial cells have been reported to respond to FGF2 by increased chemokinesis (6Yoshida A. Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and/or by chemotaxis (23Kanda S. Lerner E.C. Tsuda S. Shono T. Kanetake H. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol.

However, it should be noted that chemotaxis may be difficult to distinguish from chemokinesis depending on the experimental method used to study cell migration. The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial cell chemotaxis in stable gradients of different VEGFA splice forms and FGF2, as the precise roles of these factors in this context are yet to be fully understood. We hypothesized that a stable gradient of VEGFA would suffice in guiding endothelial cells and that interactions between VEGFA and coreceptors would not be required for the chemotactic response when the ligand was presented as a gradient. We also speculated that FGF2 would be a less potent chemotactic factor than VEGFA and that the shape of the gradient ultimately will dictate the chemotactic response. By using MCC technology, we could show that the gradient of VEGFA165 efficiently induced chemotaxis but not chemokinesis of endothelial cells. A gradient of VEGAF121 was also shown to guide endothelial cells, suggesting that VEGFA does not need to interact directly with proteoglycan and neuropilin coreceptors to induce chemotaxis. Gradients of FGF2 were shown to weakly attract venular cells but to have no significant effect on arterial cells. Finally, our data provide an approximation of the minimal VEGFA gradient steepness required for induction of endothelial cell chemotaxis, and our data suggest that cells have the capacity to sense changes of the gradient steepness to reduce net cell migration at the high end of the growth factor gradient. Production of the MCC—The methods and general principles for making different types of MCCs using soft lithography have been described before (10Jeon N.L. Baskaran H. Dertinger S.K. Whitesides G.M. van de Water L. Toner M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 26Whitesides G.M. Ostuni E. Takayama S. Jiang X. Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2001; 3: 335-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MCC was manufactured by pouring liquid polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184 Silicone elastomer kit, Dow Corning) into a mold coding for three buffer reservoirs connected via separate channels to the cell migration chamber (800 μm wide, 100 μm deep, and 7 mm long) that ends in a single outlet channel (see Fig. 1A). The mold also encodes a separate micro-channel system running along the perimeter of the PDMS piece (not shown) that when connected to a vacuum source can be used to hold the MCC onto a conventional cell culture dish (27Chung B.G. Park J.W. Hu J.S. Huang C. Monuki E.S. Jeon N.L. BMC Biotechnol. 2007; 7: 60Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The PDMS was allowed to solidify at 70 °C over night. Holes for the outlet port at the end of the channel and the liquid reservoirs were made using sharp custom-made punchers. Polyethylene tubing (Intramedic/Clay Adams) with an outer diameter slightly larger than the inner diameter of the outlet port was inserted into the outlet to make the fluidic connection. Tubing from the outlet port was connected to a syringe pump (Pump 11 PicoPlus, Harvard Apparatus) fitted with a gas tight Hamilton syringe (Sigma). Unless otherwise stated, constant perfusion with a flow speed of 200 μm/s (corresponding to shear stress of <0.1 dynes/cm2) was used for maintaining the gradient profile during the migration experiments. Cell Culture and Recombinant Proteins—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs) were purchased from PromoCell and routinely maintained in endothelial microvascular EBM MV2 growth medium (PromoCell). The endothelial cells were seeded 24 h prior to assembly of the microfluidic chamber (MCC) onto a 3-cm cell culture dish coated with type A gelatin from porcine skin (Sigma). The cells were then starved in EBM growth medium without serum and supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (denoted starvation media) for 20 h. Growth factors were added to the starvation media and deposited into the middle MCC buffer reservoir (see Fig. 1). Gradient intervals in the text refer to the initial concentrations of factors added to the buffer reservoirs. Stock solutions of recombinant VEGFA165 (PeproTech), VEGFA121 (R & D Systems) and FGF2 (PeproTech) were stored at -20 °C until further use. Time-lapse Microscopy and Data Acquisition—Endothelial cell migration was observed using a Cell Observer System (Carl Zeiss AB, Stockholm, Sweden) with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope, equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera, a motorized X/Y stage, and an XL incubator with equipment for temperature and CO2 control (Zeiss). During all experiments cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Software for time-lapse imaging and cell tracking was from AxioVision (Zeiss). Phase contrast images of cells and fluorescent images of FITC-dextran (10 kDa, used as an indirect indicator of the VEGF gradient) were taken every 5 min through a ×10 objective (Plan-Neofluar, NA 0.3, Zeiss). Cell migration in response to molecular gradients of chemotactic factors was scored in at least three independent experiments. In each experiment, data were collected from at least five different non-overlapping fields of cells growing in the MCC, as indicated in Fig. 1, during a period of 200 min. Data Analysis and Gradient Simulation—All angle histograms and polar plots are organized as described in Fig. 2. The statistical significance of the results was tested using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. Net migration toward the concentration maxima was calculated for each experiment and ranked. Plots and graphs were created in MATLAB (The Math-Works, Natick, MA). For each analyzed cell, the change in the position of the cell nucleus was determined to calculate the distance and direction of cell migration. Chemotaxis was scored by measuring the net distance of migration (in one dimension) toward higher a concentration of growth factor, i.e. migration perpendicular to the flow direction was scored. Chemokinesis was evaluated by analyzing total cell migration distances (i.e. the full paths of migrating cells in two dimensions) of cells in response to constant levels of VEGFA and FGF2. Gradient simulations were performed by two-dimensional numerical solution of a convective-diffusive equation with a laminar flow set to either 60, 80, or 200 μm/s in the chamber and zero flux boundary conditions (28Arrio-Dupont M.

Chem. 2001; 73: 1240-1246Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar) (see also supplemental data 1). Figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems). A novel MCC was employed to test our hypotheses related to the function of FGF2 and VEGFA in endothelial cell guidance and to determine the influence of gradient shape on the chemotactic response (Fig. 1). The MCCs were manufactured in transparent PDMS compatible with live imaging of cell migration and attached to regular cell culture dishes where endothelial cells were grown (see under “Experimental Procedures” for a detailed description of the MCC). A hill-shaped VEGFA165 gradient was generated by adding VEGFA to the middle reservoir (Fig. 1A). Gradient profiles were assessed by measurement of fluorescence emitted from FITC-dextran added together with VEGFA. As expected, the gradient profile changes along the length axis of the chamber (Fig. 1, B and C). The FITC-dextran employed had a molecular mass of 10 kDa but diffuses with a speed similar to VEGFA165 because of its elongated shape; the diffusion constant for FITC-dextran is 75 μm2/s compared with 133 μm2/s for VEGFA165 (28Arrio-Dupont M. Cribier S. Foucault G. Devaux P.F. d'Albis A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29MacGabhann F. Ji J.W. Popel A.S. Plos Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e127Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Simulations of FITC-dextran and VEGFA165 gradient profiles showed that the measured FITC-dextran profiles serve as a good approximation for the distribution of VEGFA165 in the MCC (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental data 1). Control experiments were performed to ensure that the added dextran did not interfere with the activity of added growth factors (supplemental data 2). Subsequently, cells from different vascular beds were tested for cell migration. Primary cells isolated from either the artery or vein of human umbilical cords (denoted HUAECs and HUVECs, respectively) adhered well to gelatin-coated cell culture dishes, and they remained attached and healthy after application of the MCC and exposure to flow rates between 60 and 2000 μm/s (data not shown). Initial testing of cell migration in response to hill-shaped gradients of VEGFA165 was performed on HUVECs. Cells with a starting position in the middle of the chamber were excluded from analysis as well as cells initially touching the edges of the chamber (as indicated in Fig. 2A). Individual cell migration in each experiment was recorded by time-lapse microscopy. Cell migration was most obvious during the 1st h of the experiments, and the length of each experiment was set to 200 min. About 85% of all HUVECs in both the left and the right sides of the chamber migrated toward the middle of the MCC and a higher concentration of VEGFA165 (Fig. 2, A–D, and supplemental movies 1 and 2). The relative distance and direction of all HUVECs scored for migration are shown in a polar plot in Fig. 2E. In this type of plot, the starting point of all cells is assigned to the middle of the plot; the relative positions of all individual cells at the end of the migration experiment is shown. Red open circles in Fig. 2E indicate cells migrating in the right side of the chamber, and blue crosses indicate cells migrating on the left side of the MCC. Importantly, HUVEC migration toward the middle of the chamber was not observed without addition of VEGFA165 to the middle reservoir (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2, F–H). Note that in the absence of VEGFA, the cells seemed to be affected by the relatively low flow-induced shear stress (<0.1 dynes/cm2) produced in the device at the flow speed of 200 μm/s, as cells had a tendency to move in the direction of flow (Fig. 2, F–H). Furthermore, arterial endothelial cells were also shown to be attracted toward an increasing concentration of VEGFA165, demonstrating that endothelial cells from different vascular beds respond to the gradient profile present in the MCC (Fig. 2, I–K). Next, the ability to modulate VEGFA-induced chemotaxis was explored by stepwise lowering of the pump flow speed, creating shallower gradients because of an increased diffusion time of growth factor molecules in the chamber (Fig. 3A). A hill-shaped VEGFA165 gradient (0–50 ng/ml at the inlet) was applied to HUVECs, and flow speeds between 60 and 200 μm/s corresponding to different gradient shapes were tested. Average chemotaxis (Fig. 3B) corresponds to net migration per cell toward a higher concentration of growth factor. The chemotactic response declined together with decreasing gradient steepness until it resembled random migration at 60 μm/s (Fig. 3, B–D).FIGURE 1Characterization of gradient profiles in the MCC.

It has previously been demonstrated that proteoglycan coreceptors are required for proper distribution and activation of several VEGFA splice forms, e.g. VEGFA165, in developing tissues and in a variety of cell signaling assays (13Ashikari-Hada S. Habuchi H. Kariya Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31508-31515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Ruhrberg C. Gerhardt H. Golding M. Watson R. Ioannidou S. Fujisawa H. Betsholtz C. Shima D.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2684-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear if binding of VEGFA to HSPGs is strictly required for the target cell to interpret positional information provided by the gradient. To address this, we generated gradients of VEGFA121, a splice form unable to interact with proteoglycan and neuropilin coreceptors. Presentation of VEGFA121 as a stable hill-shaped gradient (0–50 ng/ml) in the MCC potently induced HUVEC migration (Fig. 4, A–C). Measured positive chemotaxis induced by VEGFA121 was 22 ± 10 μm as compared with 45 ± 10 μm for VEGFA165. The diffusion coefficients for VEGFA121 and VEGFA165 are similar, and the gradients formed are comparable (supplemental data 1). Together with VEGFA and the angiopoietins, FGF2 been considered among the most important regulators of endothelial cell chemotaxis (31Lamalice L. Le Boeuf F. Huot J. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 782-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). So far, most data on the role of FGF2 in this context are derived from experiments using the Boyden chamber. In our experiments, a hill-shaped FGF2 gradient profile (0–50 ng/ml) comparable with the one tested for VEGFA did not significantly induce chemotaxis of HUAECs but had a small effect on HUVECs (Fig. 5). For each experiment evaluating migration in response to FGF2, cells from the same batch and passage were exposed to a VEGFA165 gradient as a positive control (data not shown). The FGF2 used in the chemotaxis assay was tested for activity in a cell survival assay where the effects on both HUVECs and HUAECs were shown to be similar to that of VEGFA165 (supplemental data 3). Chemotaxis in response to FGF2 was also analyzed at different flow rates (corresponding to different gradient shapes, data not shown). The highest chemotactic response exhibited by HUVECs was seen in gradients ranging from 0 to 50 ng/ml of FGF2 generated at a flow speed of 200 μm/s, as shown in Fig. 5. The effects of VEGFA and FGF2 on the chemokinetic component of HUVEC migration were evaluated by analyzing total cell migration distances in the absence of growth factor, comparing with growth factor given either at a constant concentration of 50 ng/ml or in the form of a gradient (0–50 ng/ml). Total cell migration was significantly reduced when the cells were treated with a constant level of VEGFA165 as compared with nonstimulated cells (Fig. 6A), whereas a gradient of VEGFA165 promoted migration at a speed comparable with unstimulated cells. A constant concentration of VEGFA165 in a no flow situation was also shown to reduce chemokinesis (Fig. 6B). Similarly, VEGFA121 was found to reduce chemokinesis (data not shown), whereas a constant concentration of FGF2 gave a small increase in chemokinesis at a concentration of 50 ng/ml (Fig. 6C). Next, the effects on chemokinesis of different doses of VEGFA and FGF2 were investigated; VEGFA but not FGF2 was shown to reduce chemokinesis at all tested concentrations (supplemental data 4). Finally, cell migration was analyzed in different parts of the VEGFA and FGF2 gradients (Fig. 7). Dose-response experiments showed that the maximal chemotactic response toward both VEGFA165 and FGF2 was achieved in the A1 region where the gradient is approximately exponential (Fig. 7, B and C; see supplemental data 5 for data on VEGFA121). Notably, chemotaxis in the A2 region, where the gradient is approximately linear, had a tendency to be stronger in the lower concentration intervals tested (Fig. 7, B and C). Gradients of VEGFA most likely exist in many tissues, but with few exceptions these gradients have been difficult to visualize and quantify (1Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C.

Watson R. Ioannidou S. Fujisawa H. Betsholtz C. Shima D.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2684-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). This study provides direct evidence that a stable gradient of VEGFA is sufficient for induction of endothelial cell chemotaxis. We show the following: 1) gradients of VEGFA are more potent in inducing chemotaxis compared with similar gradients of FGF2; 2) interactions between VEGFA and coreceptors are not absolutely required for cell guidance; 3) constant levels of VEGFA, but not of FGF2, efficiently reduce chemokinesis; and 4) the shape of the VEGFA gradient dictates the migratory response exhibited by endothelial cells. FGF2 was shown to be a poor chemotactic factor compared with VEGFA165. This result is in agreement with data from Yoshida et al. (6Yoshida A. Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) but at odds with the view that FGF2 is an effective guidance cue for endothelial cells. The effect of FGF2 on chemokinesis was also shown to be small (Fig. 6 and supplemental data 4). Taken together, our findings might in part explain the lack of an obvious vascular phenotype observed in FGF2 knockouts (32Zhou M. Sutliff R.L. Paul R.J. Lorenz J.N. Hoying J.B. Haudenschild C.C. Yin M. Coffin J.D. Kong L. Kranias E.G. Luo W. Boivin G.P. Duffy J.J. Pawlowski S.A. Doetschman T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 33Pintucci G. Moscatelli D.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that FGF2 is not a major guidance cue for endothelial cells. However, it should be noted that different types of endothelial cells may exhibit diverse migratory responses to guidance cues, as demonstrated here by the different responses exhibited by HUVECs and HUAECs to gradients of FGF2 (Fig. 5). The binding sites for VEGFA165 on cell surfaces include the high affinity receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, together with several coreceptors of neuropilin and proteoglycan type. The interaction between HSPGs and VEGFA165 is lost if the sulfation of heparan sulfate is blocked or severely reduced, or if the heparan sulfate-binding motif in VEGFA (exon 7) is removed to generate the shorter splice form VEGFA121 (4Olsson A.K. Dimberg A. Kreuger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar, 13Ashikari-Hada S. Habuchi H. Kariya Y. Kimata K. J. Biol.

A gradient of VEGFA165 spanning from 0 to 50 ng/ml over a distance of 400 μm induced the strongest chemotactic response by endothelial cells in our assay. The shorter splice form VEGFA121, unable to interact with neuropilin and proteoglycan coreceptors, was also able to attract endothelial cells, although less efficiently than VEGFA165. These results provide evidence that binding of VEGFA to coreceptors is not absolutely required for cell guidance if the ligand is provided as a gradient. However, one should note that interactions between the longer VEGFA isoforms (e.g. VEGFA165 and VEGFA189) and proteoglycan coreceptors probably are necessary for proper gradient formation in vivo (14Ruhrberg C. Gerhardt H. Golding M. Watson R. Ioannidou S. Fujisawa H. Betsholtz C. Shima D.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2684-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 16Stalmans I. Ng Y.S. Rohan R.

Cell. 2006; 10: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Varying the flow speed and thus the shape and steepness of the gradients in the MCC allowed us to identify necessary features of growth factor gradients required for an efficient chemotactic response, exemplified by the minimal gradient steepness required for a VEGFA gradient to impact HUVEC migration (Fig. 3). Analysis of cell migration in different regions of the applied gradients showed that cells efficiently interpret the positional information provided by the gradients (Fig. 7). The chemotactic responses for both VEGFA and FGF2 were more pronounced in the exponential regions of the gradients (termed A1) compared with the linear regions (A2) at all conditions tested except in the lowest concentration interval (0–1 ng/ml). In this concentration interval, the level of growth factor in the A1 region is probably too low to efficiently stimulate the cells asymmetrically. Notably, the standard deviation for scored chemotaxis was relatively large. This might suggest that there is some variability within the endothelial cell pool with regard to expression levels of the receptors for VEGFA and FGF2. Based on our findings presented here, we propose a model for how endothelial cells respond to attractive gradients of VEGFA (Fig. 8). In our model, the endothelial cell efficiently responds to the exponential part of the gradient with chemotaxis. However, the steepness of the VEGFA gradient will ultimately be reduced as the cell migrates along the gradient, and as a result the relative difference in VEGFA concentration between the front and the back of the cell will diminish leading to reduced chemotaxis. Furthermore, because a symmetric stimulation with VEGFA was shown to reduce chemokinesis (Fig. 6 and supplemental data 4), we propose that the endothelial cell will shift toward a nonmigratory phenotype at the high end of the gradient. Earlier in vitro studies of endothelial cell migration in response to various growth factors have mainly been conducted using the Boyden chamber assay (6Yoshida A. Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Growth Factors. 1996; 13: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Senger D.R. Ledbetter S.R. Claffey K.P. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Peruzzi C.A. Detmar M. Am. J.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Unlike the Boyden assay, the MCC assay offers evaluation of stable and thus highly predictable gradients of different shape. Another advantage of the MCC is that the cells are analyzed using time-lapse microscopy, where the migratory paths of cells are directly followed over time. This allows for detailed analysis of cell migration in different regions of growth factor gradients as well the opportunity to capture detailed cell behavior at the level of individual cells. Importantly, flow-induced shear stress has been shown previously to modulate both haptotactic and chemotactic responses by cells in MCC-based assays (35Hsu S. Thakar R. Liepmann D. Li S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Walker G.M. Sai J. Richmond A. Stremler M. Chung C.Y. Wikswo J.P. Lab Chip. 2005; 5: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although we see an effect of flow-induced shear stress on endothelial cell migration (Fig. 2), the maximum shear stress developed in our experiments was less than 0.1 dynes/cm2, and thus below shear stress levels previously reported to impede chemotaxis (35Hsu S. Thakar R. Liepmann D. Li S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the MCCs used in this study were coated with gelatin (isoelectric point 7.0–9.0). Interactions between growth factors and gelatin are weak at physiological pH values (37Yamamoto M. Tabata Y. Ikada Y. J. Bioact. Compat. Polym. 1999; 14: 474-489Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Still, there will conceivably be equilibrium between growth factor in solution and factor bound to the floor of the MCC. The distribution of growth factor on the floor of the MCC should, however, faithfully mirror the soluble gradient. Matrix secreted by cells could also influence growth factor binding and retention, but most high affinity binding sites for the growth factors tested in this study should be present at the cell surface. The ability of endothelial cells to divide and migrate to form new vessels is central to tumor progression and dissemination and is also important in other pathologies where vessels are affected. The biotechnological platform described here will be an important complement to animal models for the study of the general mechanisms that control cell migration and angiogenesis, and such information will be instrumental in designing improved strategies for the treatment of pathological vessels.

https://openalex.org/W1971574117,"Activity of the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is positively correlated with tumor metastasis; however, its detailed role in the mechanism of tumor invasion is still not completely understood. Here, we show that Axl enhances the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), required for Axl-mediated invasion both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the highly selective MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059, and the expressed dominant-negative form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), completely block Axl-mediated MMP-9 activation. In contrast, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and wortmannin had little effect on activation. Interestingly, however, the Axl ligand Gas6 is not involved in Axl-mediated MMP-9 activation. Mutation of Glu59(Axl) and Thr77(Axl) dramatically reduced Gas6-Axl binding but continued to induce MMP-9 activation. In addition, overexpression of Axl-activated ERK and enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transactivation and brahma-related gene-1 (Brg-1) translocation. Exposure to the NF-kappaB inhibitor silibinin, which inhibits IkappaBalpha kinase activity, or overexpression of the dominant-negative mutant IkappaB and Brg-1 strikingly inhibited Axl-mediated MMP-9 activation. These data indicate that coordination of ERK signaling and NF-kappaB and Brg-1 activation are indispensable to regulation of Axl-dependent MMP-9 gene transcription. Together with previous data, our results provide a plausible mechanism for Axl-mediated tumor invasion and establish a functional link between the Axl and MMP-9 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1996635086,"STAT (Signal transducer and activator of transcription) is a potent transcription factor and its aberrant activation by phosphorylation is associated with human cancers1,2,3,4. We have shown previously that overactivation of JAK, which phosphorylates STAT5,6, disrupts heterochromatin formation globally in Drosophila melanogaster7. However, it remains unclear how this effect is mediated and whether STAT is involved. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila STAT (STAT92E) is involved in controlling heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) distribution and heterochromatin stability. We found, unexpectedly, that loss of STAT92E, had the same effects as overactivation of JAK in disrupting heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing, whereas overexpression of STAT92E had the opposite effects. We have further shown that the unphosphorylated or 'transcriptionally inactive' form of STAT92E is localized on heterochromatin in association with HP1, and is required for stabilizing HP1 localization and histone H3 Lys 9 methylation (H3mK9) . However, activation by phosphorylation reduces heterochromatin-associated STAT92E, causing HP1 displacement and heterochromatin destabilization. Thus, reducing levels of unphosphorylated STAT92E, either by loss of STAT92E or increased phosphorylation, causes heterochromatin instability. These results suggest that activation of STAT by phosphorylation controls both access to chromatin and activity of the transcription machinery."

We previously reported that active PAK was markedly reduced in Alzheimer disease cytosol, accompanied by downstream loss of the spine actin-regulatory protein Drebrin. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) oligomer was implicated in PAK defects. Here we demonstrate that PAK is aberrantly activated and translocated from cytosol to membrane in Alzheimer disease brain and in 22-month-old Tg2576 transgenic mice with Alzheimer disease. This active PAK coimmunoprecipitated with the small GTPase Rac and both translocated to granules. Abeta42 oligomer treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons induced similar effects, accompanied by reduction of dendrites that were protected by kinase-active but not kinase-dead PAK. Abeta42 oligomer treatment also significantly reduced N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit NR2B phosphotyrosine labeling. The Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 significantly blocked the PAK/Rac translocation but not the loss of p-NR2B in Abeta42 oligomer-treated neurons. Src family kinases are known to phosphorylate the Rac activator Tiam1, which has recently been shown to be Abeta-responsive. In addition, anti-oligomer curcumin comparatively suppressed PAK translocation in aged Tg2576 transgenic mice with Alzheimer amyloid pathology and in Abeta42 oligomer-treated cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results implicate aberrant PAK in Abeta oligomer-induced signaling and synaptic deficits in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2041951326,"A lignan, lariciresinol, was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, the most widely used model plant in plant bioscience sectors, for the first time. In the A. thaliana genome database, there are two genes (At1g32100 and At4g13660) that are annotated as pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase (PLR). The recombinant AtPLRs showed strict substrate preference toward pinoresinol but only weak or no activity toward lariciresinol, which is in sharp contrast to conventional PLRs of other plants that can reduce both pinoresinol and lariciresinol efficiently to lariciresinol and secoisolariciresinol, respectively. Therefore, we renamed AtPLRs as A. thaliana pinoresinol reductases (AtPrRs). The recombinant AtPrR2 encoded by At4g13660 reduced only (-)-pinoresinol to (-)-lariciresinol and not (+)-pinoresinol in the presence of NADPH. This enantiomeric selectivity accords with that of other PLRs of other plants so far reported, which can reduce one of the enantiomers selectively, whatever the preferential enantiomer. In sharp contrast, AtPrR1 encoded by At1g32100 reduced both (+)- and (-)-pinoresinols to (+)- and (-)-lariciresinols efficiently with comparative k(cat)/K(m) values. Analysis of lignans and spatiotemporal expression of AtPrR1 and AtPrR2 in their functionally deficient A. thaliana mutants and wild type indicated that both genes are involved in lariciresinol biosynthesis. In addition, the analysis of the enantiomeric compositions of lariciresinol isolated from the mutants and wild type showed that PrRs together with a dirigent protein(s) are involved in the enantiomeric control in lignan biosynthesis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated conclusively for the first time that differential expression of PrR isoforms that have distinct selectivities of substrate enantiomers can determine enantiomeric compositions of the product, lariciresinol."

Here, we describe previously unknown effects of the growth factor artemin after crush injury of the dorsal spinal nerve roots in rats. Artemin not only promoted re-entry of multiple classes of sensory fibers into the spinal cord and re-establishment of synaptic function and simple behavior, but it also, surprisingly, promoted the recovery of complex behavior. These effects occurred after a 2-week schedule of intermittent, systemic administration of artemin and persisted for at least 6 months following treatment, suggesting a substantial translational advantage. Systemic artemin administration produced essentially complete and persistent restoration of nociceptive and sensorimotor functions, and could represent a promising therapy that may effectively promote sensory neuronal regeneration and functional recovery after injury."

In this study, we focused on the downregulation of a key MMR gene, MLH1, and demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible transcription repressors, differentiated embryo chondrocytes (DEC1 and 2), participated in its transcriptional regulation via their bindings to E-box-like motif(s) in MLH1 promoter region. In all cancer cell lines examined, hypoxia increased expression of DEC1 and 2, known as hypoxia-inducible genes, but decreased MLH1 expression in an exposure time-dependent manner at both the mRNA and protein levels. Co-transfection reporter assay revealed that DEC1 and, to greater extent, DEC2 as well as hypoxia-repressed MLH1 promoter activity. We further found that the action was remarkably inhibited by trichostatin A, and identified a possible DEC-response element in the MLH1 promoter. In vitro electrophoretic gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that DEC1 or 2 directly bounds to the suggested element, and transient transfection assay revealed that overexpression of DEC2 repressed endogenous MLH1 expression in the cells. Hypoxia-induced DEC may impair MMR function through repression of MLH1 expression, possibly via the histone deacethylase-mediated mechanism in cancer cells."

Using a combination of surface labeling, immunoprecipitation, and vesicle proteomics approaches, we have identified glucose transporter-1 as the receptor for dematin and adducin in the human erythrocyte membrane. This finding is the first description of a transmembrane protein that binds to dematin and adducin, thus providing a rationale for the attachment of the junctional complex to the lipid bilayer. Because homologues of dematin, adducin, and glucose transporter-1 exist in many non-erythroid cells, we propose that a conserved mechanism may exist that couples sugar and other related transporters to the actin cytoskeleton.

There is considerable interest in the elucidation of the mechanism that governs the linkage of elongated spectrin molecules to the erythrocyte plasma membrane (1Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E.

The mechanism by which the “head” region of the spectrin dimer, which participates in tetramer formation, binds to the membrane via ankyrin and band 3 has been well characterized (1Lux S.E. Palek J.

Blood. 1992; 80: 1869-1879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism that anchors the tail end of the spectrin dimer to the plasma membrane is not completely understood. This region, containing a short actin protofilament and the tail ends of spectrin polypeptides, is often referred to as the “spectrin-actin junction” or the “junctional complex” (4Bennett V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 5Gilligan D.M. Bennett V. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar). Protein 4.1R, dematin, and adducin have been directly visualized by immunogold electron microscopy as components of the junctional complex (6Derick L.H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Palek J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 317-320PubMed Google Scholar). Other proteins that are likely to be present at the junctional complex include tropomyosin, tropomodulin, p55, and calmodulin. Among the junctional complex components, the best characterized membrane-protein interaction involves protein 4.1R (5Gilligan D.M. Bennett V. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar, 7Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). Protein 4.1R binds directly to p55 and glycophorin C, a transmembrane protein, and this ternary complex is believed to attach the junctional complex to the plasma membrane (4Bennett V. Biochim.

Our recent findings from the genetically altered mice suggest that other components of the junctional complex may also perform this crucial function (10Chen H. Khan A.A. Liu F. Gilligan D.M.

Dematin and adducin are two cytoskeletal proteins that could perform a function that is similar to the vertical interactions of protein 4.1R. These actin-binding phosphoproteins are located at the erythrocyte junctional complex. Individually they exert modest effects on erythrocyte shape and membrane stability, as revealed by their gene knock-out phenotypes in mice (12Gilligan D.M. Lozovatsky L. Gwynn B. Brugnara C.

Our more recent findings indicate that dematin and adducin serve redundant functions at the junctional complex, and mutant mice lacking both dematin-headpiece domain and β-adducin display severe defects in erythrocyte shape, membrane instability, and hemolysis (10Chen H. Khan A.A. Liu F. Gilligan D.M. Peters L.L. Messick J. Haschek-Hock W.M. Li X. Ostafin A.E. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4124-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of mis-shapen and fragmented erythrocytes correlated with their increased osmotic fragility and reduced life span in vivo (10Chen H. Khan A.A. Liu F. Gilligan D.M. Peters L.L. Messick J.

In addition, we demonstrated that purified dematin can bind to the trypsin-sensitive sites present on human erythrocyte inside-out vesicles in a saturable manner. These observations demonstrated that dematin and adducin together play an essential role in the maintenance of erythrocyte shape and membrane stability. Based on these findings, we have proposed a model where dematin and adducin could function as adaptors by linking the junctional complex to the membrane via a transmembrane receptor. To experimentally validate this model, we carried out a systematic search for the membrane receptor that could bind to dematin and adducin in the human erythrocyte membrane. Here we demonstrate that glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) 2The abbreviations used are: GLUT1, glucose transporter-1; WT, wild type; DAKO, dematin-adducin double knockout; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IOVs, inside-out vesicles; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; IP, immunoprecipitation; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; ROV, right side-out vesicle; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is one such receptor that binds to both dematin and β-adducin in the human erythrocyte plasma membrane. Our model predicts that GLUT1, a multispan transmembrane receptor, assembles a novel cytoskeletal complex with dematin and β-adducin at the tail ends of spectrin tetramers, and this ternary complex provides a new mechanism for the linkage of the junctional complex to human erythrocyte plasma membrane. Proteomics of Erythrocyte Inside-out Vesicles (IOVs)—A comprehensive proteomics analysis was performed on highly purified alkali-stripped inside-out vesicles. Freshly collected human erythrocytes from an adult male were washed with PBS to remove the buffy coat, and sequentially passed through two columns containing a mixture of Sigma Cell type 50 and α-cellulose. Ghosts were prepared by hypotonic lysis, and loosely attached ghosts were recovered by tilting the tube to remove the red button. IOVs were prepared by incubation of ghosts in 50 volumes of the IOV buffer (0.1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) overnight at 4 °C. IOVs were recovered by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min and washed with the IOV-resuspension buffer (0.4 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA). Peripheral membrane proteins were stripped from the IOVs by incubation in an alkaline solution (0.5 mm EGTA, pH 11.0) at 37 °C for 1 h. The alkali-stripped IOVs were washed and separated from the right side-out vesicles (ROVs) by density gradient ultracentrifugation using a dextrose barrier solution (15Jarvis S.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IOVs were diluted 3-fold and gently layered on an equal volume of 4.5% (w/v) dextran solution. The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The IOVs remained at the top of the barrier solution, and the ROVs pelleted at the bottom. Purified-stripped IOVs were gently recovered, washed with the resuspension buffer, and dissolved in 0.3 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20 mg/ml sucrose. The mouse erythrocyte IOVs were prepared using a similar approach except that the alkali-stripped IOVs were not further purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Purified IOVs were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and comprehensive proteomics was performed at the Wistar Institute Proteomics Facility in Philadelphia. Briefly, the IOVs were solubilized in 5× SDS sample buffer and 20 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and run for 4 cm on a one-dimensional 4–12% polyacrylamide gel using a BisTris-based buffer system. Gels were stained using colloidal Coomassie solution, and one 16-μg lane was divided in slices for trypsin digestion. Gel slices were destained, reduced using 20 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, alkylated using 40 mm iodoacetamide, and digested using 20 μl of 0.02 μg/ml modified trypsin in ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 30% acetonitrile for 18 h at 37 °C. After digestion, the supernatant was removed; peptides trapped in the gel were extracted with an additional aliquot of digestion buffer for 45 min, and both supernatants were pooled. Digests were subjected to nanobore capillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, which was interfaced directly with MS/MS analysis on a ThermoFinnigan LTQ FT ICR mass spectrometer. MS/MS data were searched versus the NCBI nr data base using SEQUEST, and results were analyzed using Proteomics Browser. The data shown in supplemental Tables 1 and 2 were obtained from the entire gel lane. Preparation of Ghosts and Membrane Skeletons—Ghosts were prepared by hypotonic lysis of washed erythrocytes in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triton shells/skeletons were prepared by incubation of the ghosts with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and KCl either at 0.1 or 0.5 m for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, the skeletal pellet was rinsed gently with PBS and dissolved in the sample buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. Surface Labeling and Immunoprecipitation Assay—To identify the dematin-binding receptor(s), co-immunoprecipitation of biotin-labeled erythrocyte membrane proteins was performed. Human erythrocytes (250-μl packed volume) were surface-labeled with 1.0 mg of NHS-biotin in 1.0 ml of PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Unconjugated biotin was quenched with Tris-HCl solution, and labeled erythrocytes were extensively washed with Tris-buffered saline. Ghosts and IOVs were prepared for the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. IOVs (0.5 mg of total protein) were pre-cleared with 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein-G-Sepharose beads in the immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) for 1 h at 4 °C. IP was performed with 2.0 μg of anti-dematin monoclonal antibody, and protein-G-Sepharose-bound immune complex was eluted, blotted, and probed with the streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to detect biotin-labeled bands. Expression of Glucose Transporter-1 in Human Epithelial Cells—To evaluate the interactions of GLUT1 with dematin and adducin, transfections and co-IP assays were performed. For transient transfections, HEK293T cells (human embryonic kidney epithelial) were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/plate (10 cm). Plasmids for dematin (dematin 48-kDa/pcDNA3.1) and GLUT1 (GLUT1/pEGFP-C1) were isolated by the Qiagen maxiprep kit and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 20 h of transfection, cells were rinsed briefly with PBS and harvested in 1.0 ml of IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After cell lysis at 4 °C for 30 min, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. For the IP assay, an anti-dematin monoclonal antibody (2.0 μg/sample) was added to the lysate and an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was used as a negative control. The immune complex was harvested using protein-G-Sepharose beads, and bound GLUT1 was detected using an anti-GLUT1 rabbit polyclonal antibody. Essentially the same strategy was used to test the binding of dematin with GLUT1cyto4, a chimeric construct, where the large middle cytoplasmic loop of GLUT1 was replaced by the same loop from GLUT4. To investigate the interactions of adducin with GLUT1 and GLUT1cyto4 in HEK293T cells, a FLAG-tagged β-adducin construct (human β-adducin/pCMV-FLAG) was made, and co-IP assays were performed using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody conjugated to the beads. Endogenous Association of Dematin with GLUT1—For the endogenous dematin-GLUT1 complex, human erythrocyte ghosts (400 μl, 1.0 mg of total protein) were mixed with an IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the lysate was pre-cleared with 50 μl of 50% protein-G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysate was immunoprecipitated with either 2.5 μg of anti-dematin monoclonal antibody or an unrelated anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. After incubation for 4.0 h at 4 °C, the immune complex was harvested using 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein-G-Sepharose beads. To distinguish any signal in the Western blots from the IgG heavy chains, which migrate near the position of GLUT1, additional negative controls with monoclonal antibodies without the lysate were included. In Vitro Interaction of Dematin with GLUT1—To demonstrate an interaction between GLUT1 and purified dematin, a pulldown assay was designed. Full-length GLUT1 was expressed in the HEK293T cells as described earlier. The GST fusion proteins containing either the full-length dematin or its core domain were expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The GLUT1-transfected cells were harvested and lysed in the IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The pre-cleared lysates were incubated with purified GST fusion proteins immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed, and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-GLUT1 polyclonal antibody. Dematin Binds to a Surface-labeled Protein in Human Erythrocytes—Recently, we reported that native dematin, purified from human erythrocyte ghosts, associated with trypsin-sensitive sites on the cytoplasmic surface of alkali-stripped inside-out vesicles (10Chen H. Khan A.A. Liu F. Gilligan D.M. Peters L.L. Messick J. Haschek-Hock W.M. Li X. Ostafin A.E. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4124-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that dematin may bind to a transmembrane protein in the human erythrocyte membrane. To identify this putative receptor, we immunoprecipitated dematin from the surface-labeled human erythrocytes. Freshly collected human erythrocytes were surface-labeled using NHS-biotin. After the removal of free biotin and extensive surface blocking, the labeled erythrocytes were hypotonically ruptured to prepare ghosts and IOVs. Spectrin-actin-depleted IOVs were solubilized in the non-ionic detergent, and dematin was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody. Biotin-labeled surface membrane proteins that associated with the dematin immune complex were visualized by the streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. Western blotting revealed specific co-precipitation of an ∼54-kDa protein in the dematin immune complex (Fig. 1A, lane 2, arrow). Two relatively weaker bands migrating in the range of 100–250 kDa were also observed, although the reproducibility of the very top band was not consistent in multiple experiments. These results suggested that dematin binds to an ∼54-kDa membrane protein in the human erythrocyte plasma membrane. Identification of the Dematin-binding Protein by Vesicle Proteomics—Because the gel mobility of ∼54-kDa transmembrane protein is near the location where the immunoglobulin heavy chain and the endogenous dematin migrate, it was technically difficult to identify this protein in the dematin immunoprecipitates by direct sequencing of the gel band. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive proteomics of human erythrocyte IOVs with the expectation that this approach might reveal the identities of candidate ∼54-kDa membrane proteins that could potentially bind to dematin. A critical requirement for the success of this approach was the isolation of highly purified membrane vesicles free of peripheral membrane proteins. To accomplish this goal, we first carried out a rigorous removal of leukocytes and platelets from freshly isolated human erythrocytes. After the removal of spectrin and actin from erythrocyte ghosts by multiple low ionic strength extractions, the IOVs were stripped of nearly all peripheral membrane proteins by extraction with the pH 11 solution (17Boukharov A.A. Cohen C.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1391-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Finally, the alkali-stripped IOVs were biochemically purified from the ROVs by density gradient centrifugation. The polypeptides of purified IOVs were separated by gel electrophoresis, and bands were sequentially excised for analysis by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteomics data, shown in supplemental Table 1, represent 60 relatively abundant proteins identified in the alkali-stripped IOVs of human erythrocytes. Although the proteins are arranged according to the abundance of total MS/MS spectra observed divided by mass or normalized spectral counts (data not shown), the protein ranking is a rough estimate of relative protein abundance. This is because some peptides derived from membrane proteins will be impossible to detect by the methods used here, as they are either too hydrophobic or are heavily glycosylated. Therefore, in principle, some membrane proteins may be missed using this approach. The absence of peptides from proteins generally associated with platelets and leukocytes further confirms the purity of human erythrocyte IOVs used in this study. There are several noteworthy features of the proteomics analysis of human erythrocyte IOVs shown in supplemental Table 1. For example, the stripped IOVs still retain a subpopulation of peripheral membrane proteins such as band 4.2, p55, ankyrin, β-hemoglobin, and the RAB family of small GTPases. Because this subpopulation of peripheral membrane proteins resisted stringent membrane dissociation at pH 11, we speculate that their tight membrane association presumably originates from their lipid modifications in vivo or some as yet unknown covalent modification that anchors them so tightly to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. This speculation is consistent with the known lipid modifications of protein 4.2, p55, ankyrin, and small GTPases (18Das A.K. Bhattacharya R. Kundu M. Chakrabarti P. Basu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Staufenbiel M. Lazarides E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ubiquitin was present in all gel bands, and based on the spectral counts, it appears that ubiquitin is an abundant polypeptide in the mature human erythrocyte membrane IOVs. The reason for the tight ubiquitin association with membrane proteins in the terminally differentiated erythrocytes is not clear at this stage, although it is now known that mono-ubiquitination is associated with signaling rather than degradation pathways. Several recent studies have reported detailed proteomics of the membrane and cytosolic fractions of human erythrocytes (21Kakhniashvili D.G. Bulla Jr., L.A. Goodman S.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Pasini E.M. Kirkegaard M. Mortensen P. Lutz H.U. Thomas A.W. Mann M. Blood. 2006; 108: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Overall, our proteomic data are consistent with these studies. However, we believe that the proteomic data shown in this study constitute the first report where alkali-stripped IOVs were biochemically purified from ROVs for mass spectrometry. Because the contamination of ROVs in the conventional preparations of IOVs generally contributes to the presence of trapped peripheral membrane proteins, our results provide the most rigorous identification of the transmembrane and tightly associated lipid-modified peripheral membrane proteins in human erythrocytes. Importantly, the vesicle proteomic data revealed at least five proteins in the vicinity of the 54-kDa region of human IOVs. These proteins include the solute carrier family 2 (glucose transporter-1), solute carrier family 29 (nucleoside transporter-1 or ENT1), Scianna blood group antigen, solute carrier family 43 (member 3), and the Rh protein (supplemental Table 1). Based on the known properties of these proteins, and some initial observations on the obesity phenotype of dematin headpiece knock-out mice, 3A. H. Chishti, unpublished data. GLUT1 emerged as a likely candidate receptor suitable for binding to dematin and adducin in human erythrocytes. Dematin Binds to GLUT1—To evaluate the biochemical interaction between dematin and GLUT1, a transfection and co-immunoprecipitation-based approach was used. Full-length dematin (48-kDa subunit) and full-length GLUT1 were transiently transfected into the human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) epithelial cells, and dematin was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody. An unrelated monoclonal antibody against the CD3 antigen was used as a negative control. The dematin immune complex was examined for the presence of GLUT1 by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against GLUT1. The expression of transfected GLUT1 alone (Fig. 1C, lane 2) and upon co-transfection with dematin (Fig. 1C, lane 3) was confirmed by the presence of a diffuse band, and higher molecular mass polypeptides, presumably because of its glycosylation and oligomerization in the epithelial cells. In the transfected cells with GLUT1 alone, immunoprecipitation with either the anti-CD3 or anti-dematin monoclonal antibody did not show any GLUT1 signal, indicating the absence of any significant amount of endogenous dematin in the HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). In contrast, the immunoprecipitation of dematin from cells that were co-transfected with GLUT1 and dematin showed a significant amount of GLUT1 in the dematin immune complex (Fig. 1C, lane 7). As expected, the anti-CD3 immune complex was negative for the presence of GLUT1 (Fig. 1C, lane 6). These results suggest a specific biochemical interaction between dematin and GLUT1 under these conditions. To further demonstrate the specificity of dematin-GLUT1 interaction, we transfected an Xpress-tagged protein 4.1R construct and GLUT1 in HEK293T cells. We have previously shown that this 4.1R construct expresses both 80- and 135-kDa isoforms of protein 4.1R (23Huang S. Lichtenauer U.D. Pack S. Wang C. Kim A.C. Lutchman M. Koch C.A. Torres-Cruz J. Huang S.C. Benz Jr., E.J. Christiansen H. Dockhorn-Dworniczak B. Poremba C. Vortmeyer A.O. Chishti A.H. Zhuang Z. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 31: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of protein 4.1 using an Xpress monoclonal, under the same conditions as used for the dematin-GLUT1 interaction, did not immunoprecipitate GLUT1 (Fig. 1, D and E). The membrane topology model of GLUT1 predicts several protein segments facing the cytosolic compartment. These segments include a 12-amino acid N-terminal domain, a major 64-amino acid cytoplasmic loop, a 42-amino acid C-terminal domain, and four short internal loops of 8–10 amino acids (24Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because this topology model is conserved among class I glucose transporters and other related transporters, we investigated whether the interaction of dematin with GLUT1 was sensitive to the specificity of the 64-amino acid cytoplasmic loop of GLUT1. A chimeric full-length GLUT1 construct where the 64-amino acid cytoplasmic loop of GLUT1 was replaced with a similar loop from the insulin-sensitive GLUT4 transporter, which is expressed predominantly in the muscle and adipocytes, was tested for binding to dematin. This chimeric protein, termed GLUT1cyto4, bound dematin as efficiently as GLUT1 (Fig. 1F, lane 7). This result suggests that dematin interacts either with the 64-amino acid cytoplasmic loops of both GLUT1 and GLUT4 or it binds to GLUT1 on a site other than the 64-amino acid cytoplasmic loop. To distinguish this possibility, we engineered a His-tagged dematin construct (48-kDa subunit) and the GST-tagged 64-amino acid cytoplasmic loop of GLUT1 as fusion proteins. Pulldown assays established that recombinant dematin can directly bind to the 64-amino acid cytoplasmic loop fusion protein of GLUT1 (data reviewed but not shown). To quantify this interaction, we developed a sandwich-type Biosensor assay. An antibody against the His tag was immobilized to the CM5 Biosensor chip, and the His-tagged dematin was conjugated to the chip surface. The GST-loop fusion protein of GLUT1 was passed over the immobilized dematin, and its binding affinity was estimated to be ∼145 nm. The GST was used as a negative control. Future studies designed to quantify the interaction of full-length GLUT1 with limited truncations of both N- and C-terminal segments, their chimeras, and in vitro mutagenesis of the intracellular loop would be required to precisely determine the molecular basis of dematin-GLUT1 interaction in human erythrocytes. To further map the GLUT1-binding site within dematin, a pulldown assay was designed. Full-length dematin and its core domain were expressed in bacteria and purified as GST fusion proteins. It is noteworthy that the core domain of dematin contains a PEST sequence, and therefore the recombinant core domain degrades rapidly under in vitro expression conditions (11Azim A.C. Knoll J.H. Beggs A.H. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17407-17413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Full-length GLUT1 was expressed in HEK293T cells, and the lysate was incubated with purified GST fusion proteins of dematin-immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads. Western blotting showed that GLUT1 binds to both full-length and the core domain of dematin (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). The core domain, however, generated a relatively weaker signal suggesting that the full-length dematin polypeptide provides a more robust binding surface for GLUT1 under these conditions. To demonstrate an endogenous interaction between dematin and GLUT1, the dematin-GLUT1 complex was immunoprecipitated from human erythrocyte ghosts. It is noteworthy that the immunoprecipitation of erythrocyte membrane proteins is often difficult, generally requiring a large amount of the antibody and thus generating excessive nonspecific background signals. With this limitation in perspective, we optimized the conditions to immunoprecipitate the dematin-GLUT1 complex from the detergent-solubilized ghosts using an anti-dematin monoclonal antibody. To distinguish the GLUT1 signal from the IgG heavy chain, which migrates at a similar position as GLUT1, two additional controls without lysates were included. The anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was used as a negative control. Western blots"
https://openalex.org/W1994778014,"Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSVs), in clinical trials for the treatment of malignant gliomas, are assumed to be selective for tumor cells because their replication is strongly attenuated in quiescent cells, but not in cycling cells. Oncolytic selectivity is thought to occur because mutations in viral ICP6 (encoding a viral ribonucleotide reductase function) and/or γ34.5 function are respectively complemented by mammalian ribonucleotide reductase and GADD34, whose genes are expressed in cycling cells. However, it is estimated that only 5–15% of malignant glioma cells are in mitosis at any one time. Therefore, effective replication of HSV oncolytic viruses might be limited to a subpopulation of tumor cells, since at any one time the majority of tumor cells would not be cycling. However, we report that an HSV with defective ICP6 function replicates in quiescent cultured murine embryonic fibroblasts obtained from mice with homozygous p16 deletions. Furthermore, intracranial inoculation of this virus into the brains of p16−/− mice provides evidence of viral replication that does not occur when the virus is injected into the brains of wild-type mice. These approaches provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that ICP6-negative HSVs are ‘molecularly targeted,’ because they replicate in quiescent tumor cells carrying specific oncogene deletions, independent of cell cycle status."

https://openalex.org/W1998490570,"The Drosophila Toll receptor, which functions in both embryonic patterning and innate immunity to fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, is activated by a dimeric cytokine ligand, Spätzle (Spz). Previous studies have suggested that one Spz cross-links two Toll receptor molecules to form an activated complex. Here we report electron microscopy structures of the Toll ectodomain in the absence and presence of Spz. Contrary to expectations, Spz does not directly cross-link two Toll ectodomains. Instead, Spz binding at the N-terminal end of Toll predominantly induces the formation of a 2:2 complex, with two sites of interaction between the ectodomain chains, one located near to the N terminus of the solenoid and the other between the C-terminal juxtamembrane sequences. Moreover, Toll undergoes a ligand-induced conformational change, becoming more tightly curved than in the apo form. The unexpected 2:2 complex was confirmed by mass spectrometry under native conditions. These results suggest that activation of Toll is an allosteric mechanism induced by an end-on binding mode of its ligand Spz."
https://openalex.org/W2073533593,"The NADPH oxidases (Noxs) are a family of superoxide-generating enzymes implicated in a variety of biological processes. Full activity of Nox1, -2, and -3 requires the action of a Rac GTPase. A direct regulatory interaction of Rac with Nox2 has been proposed as part of a two-step mechanism for regulating electron transfer during superoxide formation. Using truncation analysis of Rac binding to the cytoplasmic tail of Nox2, along with peptides derived from this region in cell-free assays, we identify a Rac interaction site within amino acids 419–430 of Nox2. This region is required for binding Rac2 but not p47phox or p67phox cytosolic regulatory factors. A cell-permeant version of the peptide encompassing amino acids 419–430 specifically inhibits NADPH oxidase activation in intact human neutrophils. Mutational analysis of the putative Rac-binding site revealed specific residues, particularly Lys-421, Tyr-425, and Lys-426, individually required for Rac-dependent NADPH oxidase activity that are conserved in the Rac-regulated Nox1, Nox2, and Nox3 enzymes but not in Nox4 or Nox5. Mutation of the conserved residues in the Rac-binding site of Nox1 also result in the loss of Rac-dependent activity.

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase plays an important role in host innate immune responses to infection. Through its ability to catalyze the formation of superoxide anion via the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, the phagocyte NADPH oxidase initiates the formation of a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; aa, amino acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; INT, p-iodonitrotetrazolium; fMLP, fMet-Leu-Phe; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; CGD, chronic granulomatous disease; GppNHp, guanosine-5-(β-imino)triphosphate. that participate in the killing and destruction of ingested microorganisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Cross A.R.

Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Over the past several years, homologs of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase, termed Nox(s), have been identified in nonphagocytic cells. There are currently seven Nox family members, including Nox1–5 and Duoxs (dual oxidase) 1 and 2 (3Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar, 4Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D.

Sci. 2003; 28: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). With the identification of these nonphagocyte Noxs has come the recognition that the generation of ROS by Nox has important roles in intracellular signaling in addition to host defense. Indeed, roles of Nox enzymes in the regulation of biological and pathological processes range from hearing and balance (Nox3), blood pressure regulation, inflammation, cell growth, and cancer (Nox1), angiogenesis and cellular differentiation (Nox4), and innate immunity in the respiratory and gut epithelium, as well as thyroid hormone synthesis (Duox1/2) (3Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4958) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase of phagocytic leukocytes, Nox2, is the best characterized oxidase system in terms of regulation, and serves as a prototype for understanding the control of the nonphagocyte Noxs. The redox center of the system is a heterodimeric flavocytochrome b558 composed of two integral membrane proteins, Nox2 (also known as gp91phox) and p22phox. The transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to molecular oxygen to form superoxide anion is catalyzed by this Nox2/p22phox complex (1Cross A.R. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1657: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Morel F. Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Assembly of the system and activation of electron transfer is controlled, however, by the action of cytosolic regulatory subunits, including p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 GTPase in human leukocytes (1Cross A.R. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1657: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Morel F. Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Indeed, genetic deficiency in humans of Nox2 or any one of the regulatory oxidase components results in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a disorder of innate immunity characterized by severe, recurrent bacterial and fungal infections (6Heyworth P.G.

Blood. 1991; 77: 673-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular events associated with NADPH oxidase assembly and activation have been partially established (reviewed in Refs. 8DeLeo F.R.

J. 2005; 386: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar); p40phox and p47phox are adapters containing protein-protein interaction PXXP and Src homology 3 motifs, as well as lipid/membrane-binding phox motifs. Although critical for the membrane assembly of the NADPH oxidase in response to cellular stimuli (10Quinn M.T. Gauss K.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 760-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), these adapter proteins are not absolutely required for intrinsic activity of the in vitro system (11Freeman J.L.

In contrast, p67phox and Rac GTPase are absolutely required for Nox2 activity. p67phox contains an “activation domain” that is necessary to stimulate electron transfer by Nox2 (13Han C.H.

In addition, p67phox contains a series of tetratricopeptide repeats that mediate its interaction with Rac GTPases (14Koga H. Terasawa H. Nunoi H. Takeshige K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

In adherent leukocytes, Rac2 appears to act as the critical “molecular switch” for activating the NADPH oxidase (20Zhao T. Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1732-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that Rac GTPases solely act to position the activation domain of p67phox on cytochrome b558 for regulation of electron transfer, there is also significant evidence that Rac itself interacts directly with the cytochrome b558 to catalyze the initial electron transfer step from NADPH to Nox2-bound FAD (reviewed in Ref. 21Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In prior studies we provided evidence, using changes in the fluorescence of Rac2-N-methylanthraniloyl-GppNHp, for a direct interaction of Rac2 with partially purified cytochrome b558 (22Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and we showed that GST-Rac1 or -Rac2 specifically bound cytochrome b558 from neutrophil membrane extracts (23Diebold B.A. Fowler B. Lu J. Dinauer M.C. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, whether there is a direct regulatory interaction of Rac GTPase with Nox2 remains controversial (21Bokoch G.M.

Similar to the phagocyte Nox2 system, recent evidence also indicates that the closely homologous Nox1 and Nox3 oxidases of nonphagocytic cells also require Rac GTPases for optimal activity (24Miyano K. Sumimoto H. Biochimie (Paris). 2007; 89: 1133-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Cheng G. Diebold B.A. Hughes Y. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

However, regulation by Rac GTPase does not appear to be required for the function of Nox4, Nox5, or the Duox family members (28Kamiguti A.S. Serrander L. Lin K. Harris R.J. Cawley J.C. Allsup D.J.

Signal. 2006; 18: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Studies to date have implicated the interaction of Rac1 with the NoxA1 regulatory component (the p67phox-homolog) as the means by which Nox function is regulated by Rac1 GTPase. However, the possible interaction of Rac1 directly with Nox1 or Nox3 has not been determined. Here we use deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and in vitro/in vivo activity assays to identify a Rac-binding regulatory site on Nox2. This site is conserved on the Rac-dependent NADPH oxidases 1 and 3 but not on other Nox family members known to be insensitive to Rac GTPases. Peptides derived from the putative Rac interaction domain, as well as point mutations within the Rac binding region in the Nox proteins, disrupt Rac binding and Rac-dependent Nox2 and Nox1 activity in intact cell systems. Our results support a paradigm in which Rac GTPase directly interacts with Nox proteins to regulate ROS formation. Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP), horseradish peroxidase, luminol, cytochrome c (horse heart, type VI), p-iodonitrotetrazolium (INT), FAD, and NADPH were obtained from Sigma.

Green fluorescent protein antibody (A-11122) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Rabbit polyclonal anti-p67phox antibody (number 3958) was kindly provided by Dr. Sergio Catz (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla). Rac2 (R786), p47phox (R039), and Myc antibodies were generated in-house (31Martyn K.D. Kim M.J. Quinn M.T. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G.

A polyclonal antibody specific for Nox1 was a gift from Dr. David Lambeth (Emory University). Monoclonal antibodies 7D5, 44.1, and 54.1, specific for Nox2/gp91phox, were kindly provided by Dr. Mark Quinn (Montana State University). All Nox2 peptides and TAT epitope (YGRKKRRQRRR) peptides (33Vocero-Akbani A. Chellaiah M.A. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were synthesized, purified, and sequence confirmed by the TSRI Peptide Core facility. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant cytosolic domain of Nox2/gp91phox (aa 290–570) and truncations thereof were expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli using standard isolation protocols. Rac2 proteins were also expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins in E. coli, but the GST tag was cleaved with thrombin prior to use in in vitro binding assays, per the manufacturer's directions. Purified Rac2 proteins were quantified by the binding of [35S]GTPγS and preloaded with guanine nucleotides as described previously (34Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Circular Dichroism and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—For spectral analysis of the GST-gp91phox fusion constructs, the isolated proteins (in PBS) were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting protein concentrations were determined by absorption spectroscopy (λ280 based on the primary sequence using ProtParam). Far-UV CD measurements were collected at room temperature on a Jasco-J710 spectropolarimeter in 1-mm quartz cuvettes using protein concentrations from 50 to 120 μg/ml and the following instrument parameters: wavelength, 240–200 nm; bandwidth, 1 nm; scan rate, 50 nm/min; response time, 0.25 s; five acquisitions. The resulting CD spectra were smoothed and subtracted from buffer alone, and data were processed with software provided by the manufacturer. The secondary structure content of GST alone (in the absence of the C-terminal linker region that is encoded in the recombinant protein) was obtained on line using the Protein Data Bank file 1UA5. Fluorescence spectroscopy was conducted using a Quanta-Master QM-1 fluorometer from Photon Technologies at room temperature with the excitation monochromator set at 295 nm and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence monitored from 305 to 400 nm. For fluorescence measurements, isolated proteins were diluted to 500 nm final in PBS or PBS, 3 m guanidine hydrochloride and incubated for at least 15 min at room temperature prior to analysis. Pulldown Assays—2 μg of Rac2 protein (preloaded with either GTPγS or GDP) was incubated with 2 μg of GST-cytosolic domain of gp91phox (Nox2) or an equivalent amount of GST protein and 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 2 h with constant inversion at 4 °C. The complexes bound on the glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed with 1 ml of wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40) three times and then eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer prior to 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using polyclonal Rac2 (R786) antibody at 1:1,000 dilution (23Diebold B.A. Fowler B.

For transfection, the cells were plated in 10-cm plates (Falcon) at 1.2 × 106 cells/ml on the day before transfection. Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) was used to transfect 6 μg of the desired cDNA following the manufacturer's instructions. 21–24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1%, Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Proteins (30 μg) were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 8 V for 2 h. Following blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, blots were probed using specific antibodies at the indicated dilutions (anti-p47phox antibody at 1:10,000; anti-p67phox antibody at 1:5,000; anti-Rac1 antibody at 1:1,000). HEK293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, the 293 cells were plated in 6-well plates (Falcon) at appropriate density, grown overnight, and then transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Proteins (20 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 1 h. Following blocking with nonfat dry milk (5%), blots were probed using specific antibodies at appropriate dilutions. Proteins were detected using standard Western blotting and visualized by ECL. The blots were stripped and re-probed as necessary. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Nox2 and Nox1 Proteins—All mutations in Nox2 and Nox1 were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Detection of Nox Protein Expression—5 × 106 of COS-p22 cells were incubated with 1 μg of monoclonal antibody 7D5 (37Nakamura M.

After washing with HBSS three times, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and then flow cytometric analysis (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) was performed to detect cell surface protein expression. The expression of Nox2 and Nox1 proteins was also verified by Western blot using monoclonal antibody 54.1 for Nox2 detection (1:500 dilution) and Nox1-specific polyclonal antibody for Nox1 detection (1:2,000 dilution). Cell-free Assay for Measurement of Electron Transfer—Human neutrophil membrane fractions (GSP) and neutrophil cytosolic fractions (GSS) were prepared as described (40Curnutte J.T. Kuver R. Scott P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5563-5569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytochrome c reduction assay was as described previously (22Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) For determination of the rate of FAD reduction, 10 μg of purified neutrophil membrane and 100 μg of purified neutrophil cytosol were used for each reaction, as in Ref. 22Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar. Iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) (100 μm, final), GTPγS (10 μm, final), FAD (10 μm, final), and SDS (90 μm, final) were then added to each reaction (22Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Control wells also contained diphenyliodonium (2 μm, final). After the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, the reduced form of NADPH (400 μm, final). The rate and extent of INT reduction was monitored for 8 min at 490 nm using a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Initial rates were used to calculate Vmax values using Softmax Pro software (Molecular Devices). Whole Cell Assay for Superoxide Production—Neutrophils were isolated from healthy human venous blood as in Ref. 41Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

Superoxide production was induced with fMet-Leu-Phe (5 × 10–6 m) or PMA (2 μg/ml). For experiments using TAT peptides, the neutrophils were preincubated with the indicated concentration of each TAT peptide for 15 min at 37 °C prior to assay. For COS-p22 cells, 2.5 × 105 cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase and 72 μm luminol in 250 μl of HBSS buffer with calcium and magnesium (Invitrogen). The production of reactive oxygen species was monitored by chemiluminescence (42Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) upon the injection of PMA to the final concentration of 0.26 μg/ml (see below). For HEK293 cells, 2 × 105 cells in HBSS with calcium and magnesium were mixed with 250 μm luminol plus 1 unit of horseradish peroxidase in a 200-μl total volume in each well. Luminescence was quantified 30 min after the addition of the mixture by using a 96-well plate luminometer (Microplate LB 96V, Berthold), recording data every minute for 1 h. Localization of Rac Binding to the Cytoplasmic Domain of Nox2 by Deletion Analysis—We have previously provided evidence for the direct interaction of Rac2 GTPase with Nox2 by showing changes in the fluorescence of N-methylanthraniloyl-GppNHp-labeled Rac2 GTPase upon interaction with partially purified cytochrome b (22Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), as well as by demonstrating the specific binding of GST-Rac1 or Rac2 to intact cytochrome b from human neutrophil lysates (23Diebold B.A. Fowler B. Lu J. Dinauer M.C. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In support of these results, we established that an expressed GST fusion protein containing aa 290–570 of the Nox2 C terminus, predicted to be the cytoplasmic portion of the Nox2 (or gp91phox) subunit, is capable of specifically binding Rac2 (Fig. 1B). Binding was detected with both Rac1 and Rac2 and was largely independent of the nucleotide state of the GTPase (not shown). These results confirm what we have previously observed with the full-length proteins (22Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Diebold B.A. Fowler B. Lu J. Dinauer M.C. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To narrow down the region involved in the binding of Rac GTPase to the cytoplasmic domain of Nox2, we generated a series of deletion constructs in which increasingly larger N-terminal portions of the cytoplasmic domain were removed (see Fig. 1A). Using these purified fusion protein constructs in pulldown assays, we observed that Rac2 binding was maintained until the loss of the segment spanning aa 408–450, whereupon Rac binding was lost (Fig. 1B). To provide a more detailed characterization of the GST-gp91phox fusion constructs used in this study, the isolated proteins were examined by both CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Characterization of the serially truncated GST-gp91phox constructs used in Fig. 1B demonstrated far-UV CD spectra (see Fig. 4D) that were qualitatively similar, and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra that demonstrated a similar red-shift from ∼337 nm in phosphate-buffered saline to ∼348 nm in the presence of 3 m guanidine hydrochloride (data not shown). These spectral data support the hypothesis that loss of Rac binding was thus not simply because of structural changes in the cytoplasmic domain constructs, as there was no evidence for extensive protein unfolding as the C-terminal tail was sequentially deleted (43Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 44Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). These data thus suggest that the aa 408–450 region is critical for the interaction of Nox2 with Rac2. We verified that the isolated fragment encompassing aa 408–450 was indeed able to specifically bind Rac2 on its own by direct pulldown assay (Fig. 1C). In contrast, this fragment did not bind to p47phox or p67phox (Fig. 1C), even though these regulatory proteins specifically bind to the intact Nox2 cytoplasmic domain (see Fig. 2C). The region within Nox2 encompassing aa 408–450 is bordered by two (aa 403– 417 and 441– 450) of four total domains that have been hypothesized to make up the NADPH-binding site of Nox2, based upon homology to consensus NADPH-binding sites of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family (45Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar– 47Sumimoto H. Sakamoto N. Nozaki M. Sakaki Y. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1368-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, a substantial portion of aa 408–450 is not predicted to be involved in NADPH binding. When tested in a cell-free NADPH oxidase (Nox2) assay system, the aa 408–450 peptide was able to cause a partial inhibition of SDS-induced Nox2 activity at concentrations as low as 50 nm (data not shown). These results encouraged us to further localize the putative Rac2 interaction site within aa 408–450. To do so, we generated a series of 12-amino acid peptides that sequentially overlapped throughout aa 408–450, and we tested these for their ability to antagonize Rac2-dependent NADPH oxidase activity. As shown in Table 1, Peptide 3 (aa 419–430) was the only peptide that significantly inhibited cell-free NADPH oxidase activity when tested at a concentration of 400 μm. Over a concentration range from 0 to 400 μm, Peptide 3 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell-free NADPH oxidase activity measured by cytochrome c reduction, up to a maximum inhibition of ∼75%, with an approximate Ki of 80 μm (data not shown). In contrast, neither Peptide 1, Peptide 4, nor a reverse-sequence Peptide 3 had a comparable inhibitory effect. Similar results are shown in Fig. 2A using the INT assay to measure the initial electron transfer step from NADPH to Nox2-bound FAD in the cell-free assay, which we have previously verified to be a Rac-dependent reaction (22Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, Peptide 3, encompassing the putat"

Methodology/Principal Findings Using a range of molecular and cell biological techniques, this study investigates SIV infection within reproductive organs of macaques during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. We demonstrate for the first time the presence of SIV in the testes, epididymides, prostate and seminal vesicles as early as 14 days post-inoculation. This infection persists throughout the chronic stage and positively correlates with blood viremia. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear to be the most efficiently infected reproductive organs, followed by the epididymides and testes. Within the male genital tract, mostly T lymphocytes and a small number of germ cells harbour SIV antigens and RNA. In contrast to the other organs studied, the testis does not display an immune response to the infection. Testosteronemia is transiently increased during the early phase of the infection but spermatogenesis remains unaffected. Conclusions/Significance The present study reveals that SIV infection of the macaque male genital tract is an early event and that semen-producing organs display differential infection levels and immune responses. These results help elucidate the origin of HIV in semen and constitute an essential base to improving the design of antiretroviral therapies to eradicate virus from semen."
https://openalex.org/W2048097747,"Aurora A (also known as STK15/BTAK in humans), a putative oncoprotein naturally overexpressed in many human cancers, is a member of the conserved Aurora protein serine/threonine kinase family that is implicated in the regulation of G(2)-M phases of the cell cycle. In vitro studies utilizing antibody microinjection, siRNA silencing and small molecule inhibitors have indicated that Aurora A functions in early as well as late stages of mitosis. However, due to limitations in specificity of the techniques, exact functional roles of the kinase remain to be clearly elucidated. In order to identify the physiological functions in vivo, we have generated Aurora A null mouse embryos, which show severe defects at 3.5 d.p.c. (days post-coitus) morula/blastocyst stage and lethality before 8.5 d.p.c. Null embryos at 3.5 d.p.c. reveal growth retardation with cells in mitotic disarray manifesting disorganized spindle, misaligned and lagging chromosomes as well as micronucleated cells. These findings provide the first unequivocal genetic evidence for an essential physiological role of Aurora A in normal mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome alignment segregation and maintenance of viability in mammalian embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1964857554,"The opportunistic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans causes serious disease in humans and expresses a prominent polysaccharide capsule that is required for its virulence. Little is known about how this capsule is synthesized. We previously identified a beta1,2-xylosyltransferase (Cxt1p) with in vitro enzymatic activity appropriate for involvement in capsule synthesis. Here, we investigate C. neoformans strains in which the corresponding gene has been deleted (cxt1Delta). Loss of CXT1 does not affect in vitro growth of the mutant cells or the general morphology of their capsules. However, NMR structural analysis of the two main capsule polysaccharides, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM), showed that both were missing beta1,2-xylose residues. There was an approximately 30% reduction in the abundance of this residue in GXM in mutant compared with wild-type strains, and mutant GalXM was almost completely devoid of beta1,2-linked xylose. The GalXM from the mutant strain was also missing a beta1,3-linked xylose residue. Furthermore, deletion of CXT1 led to attenuation of cryptococcal growth in a mouse model of infection, suggesting that the affected xylose residues are important for normal host-pathogen interactions. Cxt1p is the first glycosyltransferase with a defined role in C. neoformans capsule biosynthesis, and cxt1Delta is the only strain identified to date with structural alterations of the capsule polysaccharide GalXM."

This relationship suggests that similar activities might modulate other microtubule structures. Interphase microtubules usually extend from the centrosome, although noncentrosomal microtubules function in some differentiated cells, including megakaryocytes. In these cells, platelet biogenesis requires massive mobilization of microtubules in the cell periphery, where they form proplatelets, the immediate precursors of platelets, in the apparent absence of centrioles. Here we identify a cytoplasmic Ran-binding protein, RanBP10, as a factor that binds β-tubulin and associates with megakaryocyte microtubules. Unexpectedly, RanBP10 harbors GEF activity toward Ran. A point mutation in the candidate GEF domain abolishes exchange activity, and our results implicate RanBP10 as a localized cytoplasmic Ran-GEF. RNA interference-mediated loss of RanBP10 in cultured megakaryocytes disrupts microtubule organization.

Interphase cells typically contain a single MT-organizing center (MTOC) located within the centrosome. This structure contains two perpendicularly oriented centrioles and the γ-tubulin ring complex, which initiates assembly of radial MT arrays (1Schiebel E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2000; 12: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Moritz M. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Centrioles duplicate during S phase and subsequently migrate to opposite cell poles, where they anchor the mitotic spindle and enable chromosome segregation (3Urbani L. Stearns T. Curr.

After cytokinesis, the centrioles serve again as origins for interphase MTs, which are relatively stable structures. In contrast, the considerably more dynamic MTs in the mitotic spindle are assembled through the activity of the small GTPase Ran (6Carazo-Salas R.E. Guarguaglini G. Gruss O.J. Segref A. Karsenti E.

Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R502-R508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Each function requires GTP hydrolysis and exchange of GDP for GTP. Small GTPases have low intrinsic rates of nucleotide exchange, which are enhanced over 105-fold by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), a diverse group of enzymes that show limited sequence similarity and considerable target protein specificity (11Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 12Meller N. Merlot S. Guda C. J.

Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Conversely, the cytoplasmic Ran-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) RanGAP1 acts to produce Ran·GDP (16Bischoff F.R.

Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). With nuclear envelope breakdown at mitosis, chromatin-associated RCC1 generates high local Ran·GTP levels, which promote MT assembly on condensed chromosomes through distinct effects on MT nucleation, dynamics, and motor activities (18Carazo-Salas R.E.

Closely related mechanisms control macromolecule transport and mitotic spindle assembly, as Ran·GTP helps release both the cargo in nuclear import and spindle assembly factors in mitosis from the importin proteins α and β (20Gruss O.J.

Weis K. Heald R. Science. 2002; 295: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In somatic cells, these gradients rely on spatially segregated GEF and GAP activities, each of which is thought to be provided by one known enzyme. Here we report unexpected Ran-GEF activity in a novel cytoplasmic MT- and Ran-binding protein, RanBP10. This factor is expressed to high levels in megakaryocytes (MKs), the blood cell lineage in which we identified RanBP10 and studied its functions.MKs are large polyploid cells that conclude their maturation by assembling nascent blood platelets within MT-based cytoplasmic extensions known as proplatelets (24Italiano Jr., J.E.

Blood. 1980; 56: 996-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These structures extend a considerable distance from the cell body and generate nascent platelets at their tips, where single MT filaments coil repeatedly to generate the platelet marginal band (24Italiano Jr., J.E. Lecine P. Shivdasani R.A. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1299-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The elaboration, growth, stability, and dynamic quality of proplatelets are strictly dependent on MTs and require de novo nucleation of MT filaments. However, centrioles are conspicuously absent from MKs during thrombopoiesis (25Radley J.M. Scurfield G. Blood. 1980; 56: 996-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Moskvin-Tarkhanov M.I.

We show that a loss of RanBP10 disrupts MT organization, and its GEF activity provides a compelling basis to understand how the atypical MT structure of terminally differentiated MKs may be regulated. Our results also provide a novel link between Ran function and MTs other than those in the mitotic spindle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Assays—cDNA corresponding to the terminal 131 amino acids of mouse β1-tubulin (XP_283812.2) or 124 C-terminal amino acids of β5-tubulin (NP_035785) was cloned into pGBKT7 (Matchmaker System; Clontech) and introduced into the AH109 yeast strain; clones were selected by growth on Trp- medium, and protein expression was verified by immunoblotting. A cDNA library of 5 × 105 independent clones from cultured mouse MKs was created in the pGADT7 prey vector and introduced into β1-tubulin-expressing yeast, followed by selection on Trp-Leu-His- medium. 5 × 106 transformants yielded 110 clones that activated three independent reporter genes (histidine, β-galactosidase, and adenine at increasing levels of stringency). Three independent clones corresponded to a sequence represented in GenBank™ (BC024698), which was recently designated RanBP10 (NM_145824). Mouse RanBP10 constructs were derived from Image clone 3667000. All of the constructs created to map binding domains were generated by gap repair in yeast. Bait constructs to map interaction with Ran were generously provided by Iain Mattaj (EMBL, Heidelberg).Co-immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Northern Analysis—293 cells were transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RanBP10 plasmid, and cell lysates were precleared with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-HA Ab (12CA5; Roche Applied Science) was added for 2 h, and complexes captured using protein G beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Immunoblot membranes were probed separately using β-tubulin (2-28-33; Sigma), actin, H-Ras, RhoA, RhoB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Ran (clone 20; BD Biosciences), or RanBP10 Ab. Platelet or mononuclear cell lysates were probed with Ran or GAPDH (Abcam) Ab. Recombinant His6-tagged Ran was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; RanT24N and RanQ69L were prepared as described (28Klebe C. Nishimoto T. Wittinghofer F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11923-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To generate RanBP10 antisera, we immunized rabbits with the peptide SNGVASTKNKQNHSK and then purified the serum over affinity columns prepared with the peptide immunogen. Preimmune serum demonstrated no reactivity. For RNA expression analysis, a multiple-tissue Northern blot (Clontech) or ones we prepared with adult mouse bone marrow and other tissues were probed with a radiolabeled 1.6-kb fragment corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of RanBP10.Microtubule Association Assay—Fibroblasts were washed with PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7) prior to extraction with 0.5 mg/ml saponin in PEM buffer. The cells were washed twice in excess PEM buffer, and the proteins were solubilized in sample buffer before gel electrophoresis.Cell Culture and MK Viral Infections—Fetal liver cells were cultured with thrombopoietin as described (29Lecine P. Italiano Jr., J.E. Kim S.W. Villeval J.L. Shivdasani R.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MKs were enriched over a discontinuous gradient of bovine serum albumin, which favors sedimentation of mature MKs based on cell density. Retroviruses were produced as described (30Schulze H. Korpal M. Bergmeier W. Italiano Jr., J.E. Wahl S.M. Shivdasani R.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 3949-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using the pWZL expression vector to express EGFP-tagged β1-tubulin and RanBP10 as fusion proteins. Short hairpin (sh)RNAs directed against RanBP10 were introduced into MKs by infection with lentiviruses that also encoded EGFP. Two shRNAs directed against RanBP10, 1982 (target sequence AAGCCATGGGCAGAGTTCACT starting at position 1982 in Gen-Bank™ entry EU281316; supplemental Fig. S1) and 4971 (target AAACTGGCATCCTCCACAGTGT), were cloned in the pFCG vector. Only 1982 could deplete RanBP10; 4971 and empty virus served as negative controls. The cells were infected overnight with retroviruses encoding EGFP-fused β1-tubulin, RanBP10, or RanQ69L or with shRNA lentiviruses and cultured further until MKs were suitably mature. Green fluorescent cells were examined individually by fluorescence microscopy.Immunofluorescence (IF)—The cells were cytocentrifuged onto coverslips, dried, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% goat serum. β-Tubulin, β1-tubulin, γ-tubulin (clone GTU-88; Sigma), Ran, RanGAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or RanBP10 Ab were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by fluorophore-conjugated secondary Ab for 30 min. Preimmune sera or isotype controls routinely yielded no signals. The cells were counterstained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or DAPI to reveal the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. The coverslips were washed, mounted in Fluormount-G (Southern Biotech), and examined on the Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope. The images were acquired with a CM350 CCD camera (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) using a 60× (Olympus PLAN-APO 1.40 NA, 0.10 mm WD) or 100× (PLAN-APO 1.40NA, 0.10 mm WD) oil objective. 40-60 cross-sections were taken at 0.2-μm spacing, and the images were deconvolved using Delta-Vision software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA).Sequence Comparisons—Alignments were performed using the Smart v4.0 data base and refined using ExPASy with a BLO-SUM 30 matrix, with gap open and gap extension penalties of 9 and 1.5, respectively. The E value threshold to prevent false positive results was set to 1, and the alignment between a Rho-GEF consensus sequence and RanBP10 returned an E-value of 0.025. Phylogenetic similarity analysis of GEF domains was performed using ClustalW tools.Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused RanBP10 and truncated forms lacking 95 or 159 N-terminal residues or point mutants were affinity-purified using glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). RanBP10 L301I mutant was generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Protein was eluted using excess glutathione and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography-mediated gel filtration (Superdex200 [10/300], Amersham Biosciences) in reaction buffer (30 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) (28Klebe C. Nishimoto T. Wittinghofer F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11923-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the isolated protein appeared as a single band on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Aliquots resulting in a final concentration of 5 nm were added to recombinant Ran (Calbiochem; 1 μm), Rho1 (a gift of Michael Eck, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), or H-Ras (Calbiochem) in reaction buffer in the presence of a molar excess of mant-GDP or mant-GTP (Molecular Probes); the proteins were loaded with GDP or GTP (31Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) prior to purification by gel filtration chromatography. Nucleotide exchange was monitored at ambient temperature as fluorescence resonance energy transfer at 335 nm. GST and recombinant RCC1 (Calbiochem) were used as additional negative and positive controls, respectively. To calculate turnover rates and specific activities (1 unit is defined as the exchange of 1 nmol of Ran·GDP/min), we regarded dissociation rates to follow first order kinetics, as established previously (28Klebe C. Nishimoto T. Wittinghofer F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11923-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and substantiated in our experiments.RESULTSMT Modulation during MK Differentiation—Most interphase cells, including young MKs (Fig. 1B), carry a MTOC in the centrosome. As MKs mature, they increase significantly in size (routinely achieving >50 μm in diameter), become polyploid, and exhibit large, multi-lobed nuclei. By this time, astral MT arrays are replaced by characteristic complexes of interdigitating MT filaments organized in a reticular network (Fig. 1A). As the cells approach terminal differentiation and prepare to elaborate proplatelets, thick MT bundles accumulate in the cortex (Fig. 1C). Finally, new MT arrangements drive the multitude of proplatelets that are extended in the course of platelet assembly and release; this ordered sequence of events is illustrated with respect to MT morphologies in Fig. 1 (A-E). Centrioles have been difficult to detect in mature MKs (25Radley J.M. Scurfield G. Blood. 1980; 56: 996-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nagata Y. Muro Y. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which suggests atypical modes of MT assembly. To verify this premise, we tested for γ-tubulin in MKs derived from cultured fetal liver cells (32Lecine P. Blank V. Shivdasani R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7572-7578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indirect IF revealed γ-tubulin concentrated in most small cells, representing immature MKs and other blood lineages, as judged by morphology (Fig. 1, F and G). In contrast, γ-tubulin levels dropped below detection (Fig. 1, F and G) and occasionally concentrated in a single cytoplasmic focus (Fig. 1, H-J) in well differentiated MKs, recognized by their size and multi-lobed nuclei. These traces of γ-tubulin cannot readily account for the plethora of MT filaments generated within proplatelets (Fig. 1, D and E).Isolation of RanBP10 as a β-Tubulin-binding Factor—Of the five mammalian β-tubulin isotypes, the most divergent, designated β1 in the mouse, is restricted to expression in MKs and platelets (29Lecine P. Italiano Jr., J.E. Kim S.W. Villeval J.L. Shivdasani R.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lewis S.A. Gu W. Cowan N.J.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). β1-Tubulin is the predominant isoform in proplatelets and is required for efficient thrombopoiesis and discoid platelet shape (35Schwer H.D.

Much of its sequence divergence is concentrated in C-terminal helices, where MT-associated proteins are known to bind (36Nogales E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 397-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Using a C-terminal fragment of β1-tubulin as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse MK cDNA library (30Schulze H. Korpal M. Bergmeier W. Italiano Jr., J.E. Wahl S.M. Shivdasani R.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 3949-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we isolated an interacting factor, RanBP10, which shares 67% amino acid sequence identity with the Ran-binding protein RanBPM/RanBP9 (37Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Kuma K. Yokoyama N. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RanBP10 interacted equally well with the widely expressed β5-tubulin isoform in yeast cells (data not shown) and is hence nonselective for association with β-tubulins. Constructs missing 43 or 96 N-terminal amino acids failed to bind β-tubulin (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2RanBP10 is a β-tubulin- and Ran-binding protein. A, yeast two-hybrid mapping of the RanBP10 interaction with β-tubulin. RanBP10 plasmids, corresponding to the schematic shown to the right, were introduced into yeast strains expressing the C terminus of murine β1-tubulin, followed by selection on nutrient-depleted media. Proteins were considered to interact when yeast grew in the absence of histidine; growth in the absence of adenine implies stronger interactions. B, the N-terminal half of RanBP10 mediates interaction with Ran. For yeast two-hybrid analysis, RanBP10 and Ran plasmids were introduced into yeast cells, which were selected as described above. C, independent assessment of protein interactions. HA epitope-tagged RanBP10 was expressed in 293 cells. The lysates were precipitated with 5 μg of HA Ab and immunoblotted separately with Ab against β-tubulin and Ran or against RanBP10 and actin as positive and negative controls, respectively. 10% of the immunoprecipitated fraction was loaded in the Input lanes; Buf., buffer control, lacking cell lysate. D, lysates from fibroblasts expressing HA-RanBP10 were precipitated with 2 or 5 μg of HA Ab and immunoblotted for H-Ras, which was detected in the lysate but did not co-precipitate with RanBP10. E, RanBP10 is present almost equally in subcellular fractions enriched for monomeric and polymerized tubulins. Proteins were extracted (Sol) from saponin-permeabilized fibroblasts expressing HA-RanBP10, and residual cytoskeletal filaments (Insol) were solubilized in sample buffer. Both fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with RanBP10, β-tubulin, actin, and GAPDH Ab. F, purified His6-tagged Ran, RanT24N, and RanQ69L were incubated in the presence of GST-tagged RanBP10 and complexes captured with glutathione beads prior to immunoblot analysis. RanBP10 binds preferentially to Ran and the T24N mutant in this biochemical assay. G, recombinant His6-tagged Ran was added to HA-RanBP10-expressing 293 cell lysates before precipitation with 2 or 5 μg of HA Ab and immunoblotting for Ran or β-tubulin. Partial exchange between exogenous Ran and the native protein did not alter tubulin binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because RanBPM was originally identified as a Ran-binding factor (37Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Kuma K. Yokoyama N. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we asked whether its homolog RanBP10 would also interact with Ran. Yeast two-hybrid experiments verified the interaction between RanBP10 and Ran and revealed that it requires the N-terminal half of RanBP10 (Fig. 2B). To confirm the interaction, we expressed HA epitope-tagged RanBP10 in 293 cells; endogenous cellular β-tubulin co-precipitated with RanBP10 using HA antibody. RanBP10 also co-precipitated Ran but not actin, an abundant cellular protein (Fig. 2C). We detected no binding of RanBP10 to H-Ras (Fig. 2D), RhoA, or RhoB (data not shown), which argues against promiscuous interaction with small GTPases. To determine whether RanBP10 binds preferentially to monomeric or filamentous β-tubulin, we used fibroblasts expressing HA-tagged RanBP10 to separate polymerized MTs from monomeric β-tubulin. As expected, β-tubulin was present in roughly equal proportion in soluble and insoluble fractions from saponin-permeabilized cells. RanBP10 also appeared equally in the two fractions, in contrast to GAPDH, a marker for soluble cytosolic proteins, or actin, which delineated the insoluble cellular fraction (Fig. 2E).Because Ran-RanBP10 interactions in these studies could potentially be bridged by factors present in cell lysates, we purified hexahistidine (His6)-tagged Ran, RanT24N, or RanQ69L from bacteria, added the proteins to recombinant GST-RanBP10 in Mg2+-free buffer, captured complexes on glutathione beads, and immunoblotted the precipitates. RanBP10 bound best to Ran-GDP and the T24N mutant, which reflects the nucleotide-depleted state (31Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and poorly to RanQ69L (Fig. 2F). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, which may be less sensitive to such differences, RanBP10 seemed to interact equally well with the Ran mutants T24N and Q69L (data not shown).To ask whether binding of Ran and β-tubulin may be mutually exclusive, we added His6-Ran to lysates from fibroblasts expressing HA-tagged RanBP10; the two Ran forms could be discriminated by their electrophoretic migration (Fig. 2G). Excess His6-Ran did not materially influence RanBP10 binding to either endogenous Ran or β-tubulin, which suggests that RanBP10 may interact with both proteins simultaneously. Pointing further to a connection with MTs, RanBP10 contains a lissencephaly homology domain, which in other proteins influences MT dynamics (39Emes R.D. Ponting C.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, forced expression of a truncated form of the related protein RanBPM induces ectopic MT assembly in cultured fibroblasts (37Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Kuma K. Yokoyama N. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings implicate RanBP10 as a protein that interacts with both β-tubulin and Ran. Besides the lissencephaly homology domain, RanBP10 contains a SPRY motif, which may mediate protein interactions (38Wang D. Li Z. Schoen S.R. Messing E.M. Wu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem.

Later in this report (see Fig. 6, A-C), we show that treatment of cells with RanBP10-specific shRNA significantly reduced antiserum reactivity, attesting to its specificity. Indirect IF revealed a higher concentration of endogenous RanBP10 in primary MKs along cytoplasmic filaments that stain with β-tubulin antibody. Association with MTs was especially evident in cells with features of advanced differentiation and along proplatelets (Fig. 3A, inset), whereas RanBP10 staining in young MKs was weak and diffuse (Fig. 3F and data not shown). At high magnification (Fig. 3B), we noted that RanBP10 staining followed the outline, largely but not exclusively, of cellular MT filaments. Like its localization in proplatelets, RanBP10 also appeared at the periphery in circulating mouse platelets, in similar distribution to β-tubulin in MT marginal bands (Fig. 3C). Finally, in cultured primary MKs, EGFP-tagged RanBP10 was targeted to proplatelets, which are highly enriched for MTs (Fig. 3D), and in permeabilized fibroblasts RanBP10 associates significantly with an insoluble cell fraction containing polymerized MTs (Fig. 2E).

The mechanism of NTBI ferrireduction remains unknown but probably involves transplasma membrane electron transport. We here provide evidence for a novel mechanism of NTBI reduction and uptake by K562 cells that utilizes transplasma membrane ascorbate cycling. Incubation of cells with dehydroascorbic acid, but not ascorbate, resulted in (i) accumulation of intracellular ascorbate that was blocked by the glucose transporter inhibitor, cytochalasin B, and (ii) subsequent release of micromolar concentrations of ascorbate into the external medium via a route that was sensitive to the anion channel inhibitor, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate. Ascorbate-deficient control cells demonstrated low levels of ferric citrate reduction. However, incubation of the cells with dehydroascorbic acid resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of both iron reduction and uptake from radiolabeled [55Fe]ferric citrate. This stimulation was abrogated by ascorbate oxidase treatment, suggesting dependence on direct chemical reduction by ascorbate. These results support a novel model of NTBI reduction and uptake by K562 cells in which uptake is preceded by reduction of iron by extracellular ascorbate, the latter of which is subsequently regenerated by transplasma membrane ascorbate cycling.

Placenta. 1998; 19: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the mechanism of reduction remains ill-defined. Most models propose a membrane-bound ferrireductase activity (16De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) in analogy with the plasma membrane ferrireductase activity of yeast (16De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C.

Although conceptually appealing, such models ignore the probable involvement of non-enzymatic ferrireduction by endogenous reductants such as superoxide (25Ghio A.J. Nozik-Grayck E. Turi J.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) under physiological conditions. Ascorbate, a two-electron donor and nutrient that must be obtained from exogenous sources in humans, greatly enhances NTBI uptake in cell culture models, predominantly by reducing ferric to ferrous iron (10Jordan I. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Han O. Failla M.L. Hill A.D. Morris E.R. Smith Jr., J.C. J.

The resulting two-electron oxidized form of ascorbate, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), is rapidly and irreversibly degraded under physiological conditions unless reduced back to ascorbate (28Wilson J.X. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, there is mounting evidence that extracellular ascorbate can be recycled by DHA import on facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs), intracellular DHA reduction, and consequent ascorbate release (28Wilson J.X. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 29Kónya C. Ferdinandy P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we have both extended and linked these previously disjointed observations by demonstrating that (i) K562 cells can indeed recycle extracellular ascorbate via DHA import and reduction, followed by ascorbate export and (ii) this ascorbate cycling is directly linked to NTBI reduction and uptake. Importantly, this mechanism falls under the category of “transplasma membrane electron transport” as the source of reducing equivalents for extracellular ferric reduction is ultimately intracellular. These observations provide new insight into the mechanisms of NTBI reduction and uptake by K562 cells. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck (Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia). Microplate assays were performed on a Benchmark™ Plus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Regents Park Industrial Estate, New South Wales, Australia) using Nunc 96-well flat-bottom transparent plates. K562 Cells and Culture Conditions—The human erythroleukemia cell line, K562, was maintained in exponential growth as previously described (30Lane D.J.R. Lawen A. Anal.

Prior to an assay cells were harvested and washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Viable cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion, and then resuspended to final concentrations of 2–6 × 106 cells/ml in either PBS or MOPS-buffered saline (MBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 15 mm MOPS-Na+, pH 7.3). Ascorbate Loading of K562 Cells—Ascorbate loading was performed according to a modification of a previous procedure (30Lane D.J.R. Lawen A. Anal.

Briefly, 4.5 ml of PBS-washed K562 cells (8–14 × 106 cells/ml) were aliquotted into 14-ml Falcon tubes. 0.5 ml of freshly prepared DHA at final concentrations of 50–500 μm was added, followed immediately by orbital mixing for 30 min (37 °C) in the dark. The extracellular medium was thoroughly removed by three successive wash centrifugation cycles in ≥100 volumes per wash of ice-cold MBS. Determination of Intracellular and Extracellular Ascorbate—Ascorbate levels were determined according to a modified enzymatic assay in combination with the ferrocyanide determination assay of Lane and Lawen (30Lane D.J.R. Lawen A. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each unknown ascorbate-containing solution 100-μl aliquots were added to paired wells in triplicate in a 96-well plate containing either 25 μl of MBS or 25 μl of 50 units/ml ascorbate oxidase (AO; Curcurbita sp.) dissolved in MBS. Plates were then orbitally mixed at 700 rpm at room temperature for 5 min in the dark, following which 50 μl of 3.5 mm ferricyanide in MBS were added. Plates were then orbitally mixed at 700 rpm at room temperature for a further 5 min in the dark, then ferrocyanide levels determined (30Lane D.J.R. Lawen A. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ascorbate concentrations were subsequently determined by subtracting the ferrocyanide levels for the AO-containing wells (in which the resident ascorbate had been oxidized) from the AO-deficient wells (in which the ascorbate was present) for each sample. Note, as each molecule of ascorbate is capable of reducing two ferricyanide molecules (31Van Duijn M.M. Van der Zee J. VanSteveninck J. Van den Broek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13415-13420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the net ferrocyanide levels were divided by a factor of two to determine the net ascorbate concentration. The veracity of the assay was verified by generating standard curves with solutions of known ascorbate concentrations (data not shown). Intracellular ascorbate was determined by permeabilizing ascorbate-loaded cells with a final concentration of 0.1% saponin (Quijilla bark) plus 1% (v/v) ethanol in ice-cold PBS. Cells were orbitally mixed for 10 min in the cold, then centrifuged at 13,000 g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge maintained at 4 °C. Supernatants were aspirated and ascorbate determined as above. Ferrireduction Assays—Ferrireduction assays were carried out essentially according to two previously described methods (12May J.M. Qu Z.-c. Mendiratta S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. McDonald A. Fleming M.D. Blood. 2006; 108: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In brief, reduction of extracellular ferric to ferrous iron by K562 cells was assayed colorimetrically in a microplate format following complexing of ferrous iron with the cell-impermeant ferrous chelator, ferene-S (FS; λmax = 593 nm; ϵ593 = 35.5 mm–1·cm–1) (30Lane D.J.R. Lawen A. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) at concentrations of 100–200 μm. Ferric iron was supplied to cells as a freshly prepared ferric citrate chelate (20 μm FeCl3 + 50 μm sodium citrate) (33Brunner-Döpper L. Kriegerbeckova K. Kovar J. Goldenberg H. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Assays were always initiated by the addition of ferric citrate, followed by orbital mixing in an incubator (37 °C) for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation of aliquots at 3000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge maintained at 4 °C. The concentration of the ferrous chelate was then determined spectrophotometrically. “Time zero” readings were always taken by addition of all relevant reagents to cell conditioned medium immediately subsequent to initiation of the assay proper. Measurement of 55Fe Uptake—0.4 ml of MBS washed cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were aliquotted into 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes. 50 μl of [55Fe]ferric citrate containing 0.5 μCi of 55Fe as a freshly prepared ferric citrate chelate were added to a final concentration of 1.8 μm FeCl3 + 20 μm sodium citrate in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Tubes were then incubated at 37 °C with orbital mixing for 60 min. Assays were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold ‘stop’ solution (1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid in MBS). Cells were sedimented in a microcentrifuge then washed two times with 1 ml volumes of stop solution to remove surface-bound iron (12May J.M. Qu Z.-c. Mendiratta S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Subsequent to the final wash, 0.5 ml of 2% (w/v) SDS in 10% (v/v) MBS was added to the cell pellets. Complete cellular lysis was achieved by heating of the cell suspension at 95 °C for 10 min. Cellular homogenates were then mixed with 5 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold MV, PerkinElmer) and added to 6-ml plastic scintillation vials. Radioactivity was determined on tritium settings with quench correction in a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter. Iron uptake was calculated from the measured radioactivity following correction for uptake in a paired cell sample that was incubated on ice for 5 min in the presence of 1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. Data Analysis and Curve Fitting—All curve fitting and hypothesis testing were performed in SigmaPlot® 9.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) or Prism® 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), respectively. Dose-response data were modeled by single rectangular hyperbolae or simple linear regression. Differences between treatments were analyzed using both one- and two-factor analysis of variances and post hoc tests of significance using GraphPad Prism® 5.0. K562 Cells Import DHA and Reduce It Intracellularly to Ascorbate—Continuously cultured human cells are typically ascorbate-deficient due to (i) their inability to synthesize the vitamin de novo, (ii) the virtual absence of ascorbate from standard culture media, and (iii) the lability of the vitamin in solution under culture conditions (12May J.M. Qu Z.-c. Mendiratta S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Hoffman K.E. Yanelli K. Bridges K.R. Am. J. Clin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2846-2852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In accordance with this notion, K562 cells cultured as described (see “Experimental Procedures”) demonstrated negligible levels of intracellular ascorbate (Fig. 1). Even when incubated with extracellular ascorbate (0.5 mm) for 30 min these cells failed to show a significant increase in intracellular ascorbate (Fig. 1). However, when incubated with an equivalent concentration of DHA, or an oxidizing mixture of ascorbate plus the membrane-impermeant oxidant ferricyanide (5 mm), or the enzyme ascorbate oxidase (AO), the cells demonstrated a large increase in intracellular ascorbate (Fig. 1). Because both ferricyanide and AO oxidize ascorbate completely to DHA (31Van Duijn M.M. Van der Zee J. VanSteveninck J. Van den Broek P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13415-13420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), these results indicate that K562 cells selectively import the oxidized form of the vitamin and then reduce it intracellularly back to ascorbate. Assuming a mean intracellular volume of 1.65 × 10–12 liter per K562 cell (36Watkins D. Cooper B.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), an intracellular ascorbate concentration of ∼3 mm was estimated (∼5 fmol of ascorbate per cell (Fig. 1)). This entails an accumulation of ascorbate against an apparent concentration gradient of 6:1, a value that compares favorably with previous determinations (34Hoffman K.E. Yanelli K. Bridges K.R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 1188S-1192SCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Schweinzer E. Mao Y. Krajnik P. Getoff N. Goldenberg H. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1996; 14: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Importantly, this DHA-dependent increase in intracellular ascorbate was completely abrogated by preincubation of cells with the facilitative glucose transporter inhibitors, cytochalasin B (Fig. 1) and phloretin (data not shown). These data concur with numerous previous findings on DHA uptake by cultured cells (28Wilson J.X. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 38Laggner H. Besau V. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39Liang W.-J. Johnson D. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 40Ngkeekwong F.C. Ng L.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and thus strongly suggest that K562 cells possess a high capacity DHA-specific uptake route that probably involves GLUT-like transporters. The observation that ascorbate alone failed to significantly increase intracellular ascorbate further suggests that high affinity sodium ascorbate cotransporters, found to specifically import the reduced form of the vitamin in many cell types (28Wilson J.X. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 41Savini, I., Rossi, A., Pierro, C., Avigliano, L., and Catani, M. V. (2007) Amino Acids, in pressGoogle Scholar), may not contribute substantially to ascorbate uptake by K562 cells, at least under the present experimental conditions. Moreover, the preferential uptake of the oxidized form of the vitamin by K562 cells suggests that this pathway may be operative under conditions of extracellular oxidative stress, as previously suggested (12May J.M. Qu Z.-c. Mendiratta S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Laggner H. Besau V. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). K562 Cells Release Ascorbate into the Extracellular Medium: the Effect of Exogenous DHA—Many cell types, including leukemic, endothelial, and brain cells, are known to release ascorbate into the extracellular medium following ascorbate loading (12May J.M. Qu Z.-c. Mendiratta S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Wilson J.X. Annu. Rev.

Res. 2006; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of K562 cells to facilitate such ascorbate export has, however, not been conclusively demonstrated. The dose-dependent release of ascorbate in response to exogenous DHA was assessed for cells before and after prior ascorbate loading with 0.5 mm DHA. A time course of 60 min was used for these studies as the release of ascorbate was shown to be linear over this period (data not shown). Both control and DHA-loaded cells demonstrated a hyperbolic dose-dependent increase in extracellular ascorbate in response to increasing exogenous DHA concentrations (Fig. 2A). The basal ascorbate release rate for the DHA-loaded cells was vertically shifted upwards by 18 pmol·min–1·(106 cells)–1 (Fig. 2, closed versus open circles). Furthermore, the extracellular ascorbate concentrations achieved over the 60-min assay period for a cell concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml were 0.0–4.4 μm for the control cells and 4.3–10.2 μm for the DHA-loaded cells. The latter is consistent with typical physiological ascorbate concentrations observed in unsupplemented human plasma (20–60 μm (12May J.M. Qu Z.-c. Mendiratta S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). It was further observed that the addition of AO to either control cells or DHA-loaded cells in the presence of 100 μm DHA completely removed all detectable extracellular ascorbate (Fig. 2A, squares) without affecting intracellular ascorbate (data not shown). Ascorbate release cannot be attributed to cellular lysis as the proportion of viable cells before and after the assays was unchanged (data not shown), as previously noted for HepG2 cells (44Upston J.M. Karjalainen A. Bygrave F.L. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the release of ascorbate by DHA-loaded K562 cells was partially inhibited by addition of the cell-impermeant, generic anion channel inhibitor, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS) (Fig. 2A, triangles) suggesting that the release of ascorbate may occur partially through DIDS-sensitive plasma membrane anion channels (43May J.M. Li L. Hayslett K. Qu Z.-c. Neurochem. Res. 2006; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In summary, these results demonstrate that ascorbate-replete K562 cells release physiological amounts of ascorbate into the extracellular medium, and suggest that at least some of the release may occur via DIDS-sensitive anion channels in the cell membrane. It should be noted that the accumulation of extracellular ascorbate in response to DHA could be interpreted as being due to extracellular reduction of DHA to ascorbate, as previously claimed for K562 cells (37Schweinzer E. Mao Y. Krajnik P. Getoff N. Goldenberg H. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1996; 14: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we used cytochalasin B to restrict exogenous DHA to the extracellular compartment, allowing us to remove the effect of DHA uptake on extracellular ascorbate accumulation. Identical dose-response studies were performed in the presence of 50 μm cytochalasin B to block the uptake of DHA through facilitative glucose transporters (cf. Fig. 1). As seen in Fig. 2B, blockade of DHA import ablated the dose response to exogenous DHA, strongly suggesting that the appearance of ascorbate in the extracellular medium is dependent on, and preceded by, cellular uptake and reduction of DHA. Importantly, ascorbate release rates were largely unaffected by cytochalasin B (Fig. 2, B versus A, closed circles). Moreover, cytochalasin B was without significant effect on cell-mediated reduction of ferricyanide (data not shown). This indicates, as observed previously for HepG2 cells (44Upston J.M. Karjalainen A. Bygrave F.L. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), that cytochalasin B-dependent inhibition of extracellular ascorbate accumulation from DHA cannot be attributed to potential inhibition of transplasma membrane electron transport to extracellular DHA. Thus, the inability of extracellularly restricted DHA to stimulate extracellular ascorbate production (Fig. 2B) argues strongly against the involvement of a cell surface DHA reductase capable of generating extracellular ascorbate in K562 cells. NTBI Reduction by K562 Cells Is Greatly Enhanced by DHA Uptake and Ascorbate Efflux—Exogenously added ascorbate enhances dietary non-heme iron absorption (45Fidler M.C. Davidsson L. Zeder C. Hurrell R.F. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 79: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and NTBI uptake in cultured cells (26Han O. Failla M.L. Hill A.D. Morris E.R. Smith Jr., J.C. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar, 27Trinder D. Morgan E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G279-G286PubMed Google Scholar), largely through the reduction of ferric to ferrous iron (26Han O. Failla M.L. Hill A.D. Morris E.R. Smith Jr., J.C. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of K562 cells to import DHA and release ascorbate might be expected to contribute to the capacity for cell-mediated reduction of NTBI. Consistent with these expectations, May and colleagues (12May J.M. Qu Z.-c. Mendiratta S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated that U937 cells preloaded with DHA secrete low levels of ascorbate that stimulate reduction of ferric citrate and iron uptake from ferric nitrilotriacetate. To test the hypothesis that DHA loading of K562 cells increases NTBI reduction capacity, we assessed the dose response of"

Telomeres are maintained by telomerase and a collection of associated proteins. The telomeric protein telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1) negatively regulates telomere length by inhibiting access of telomerase at telomere termini. Here we report that TRF1 interacts with the β subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2) and serves as a substrate for CK2. CK2-mediated phosphorylation is required for the efficient telomere binding of TRF1 in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of CK2 by the CK2 inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole decreased the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA. The resulting telomere-unbound form of TRF1 was then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Partial knockdown of CK2 by small interfering RNA resulted in removal of TRF1 from telomeres and subsequent degradation of TRF1. Mapping of the CK2 target site identified threonine 122 as a substrate in TRF1. A threonine to alanine change at this position led to a diminished DNA binding due to reduced dimerization of TRF1. In addition, phosphorylation of threonine 122 seemed critical for TRF1-mediated telomere length control. Our findings suggest that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of TRF1 plays an important role in modulating telomere length homeostasis by determining the levels of TRF1 at telomeres.

Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein complexes that protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes (1Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Without functional telomeres, chromosomes are prone to nucleolytic degradation and end-to-end fusion leading to cell death or possibly genetic recombination or survivor selection (2Blasco M.A. Lee H.W.

Thus, telomere shortening functions as a control mechanism that regulates the replicative capacity of cells and cellular senescence (6Harley C.B. Mutat.

In humans, telomerase activity is expressed in a majority of immortalized cells, but undetectable in normal somatic cells (8Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C.

These results indicate that TRF1 negatively regulates telomere length by inhibiting the interaction between telomeres and telomerase. TRF1 and its interacting proteins such as tankyrases, TIN2, and Pinx1 have been shown to control telomere length. Tankyrases, originally identified as TRF1-interacting proteins, catalyze the formation of long chains of poly(ADP-ribose) onto TRF1 using NAD+ as a substrate (22Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Overexpression of tankyrase 1 in the nucleus results in removal of TRF1 from telomeres (23Smith S. de Lange T. Curr.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, overexpression of tankyrase 1 leads to telomere elongation, a phenotype similar to that upon TRF1 inhibition (23Smith S. de Lange T. Curr.

TIN2 forms a ternary complex with TRF1 and tankyrase and appears to stabilize the TRF1-tankyrase interaction. TIN2 protects TRF1 from poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrase 1 without affecting tankyrase 1 automodification. Moreover, partial knockdown of TIN2 by small interfering RNA results in loss of TRF1 from telomeres, leading to subsequent telomere elongation (27Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, TIN2 appears to protect TRF1 from being modified by tankyrase 1. A third TRF1-interacting protein, Pinx1, has been proposed to affect telomere length control by inhibiting telomerase activity (28Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified CK2β as a TRF1-interacting protein using a yeast two-hybrid screen. CK2 interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 in vitro and in cells. CK2-mediated phosphorylation is required for the efficient telomere binding of TRF1. Inhibition of CK2 resulted in release of TRF1 from telomeres and led to subsequent degradation of TRF1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our findings suggest a novel role of CK2 that functions as a positive regulator for determining the levels of TRF1 at telomeres. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (29Lee G.E. Yu E.Y. Cho C.H. Lee J. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34750-34755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the TRF1 cDNA was fused to the LexA DNA binding domain and transformed by the lithium acetate method into the EGY48 yeast strain. Expression of the LexA-TRF1 fusion protein was verified by Western blotting using anti-LexA antibody. The stable strain was transformed again with an HeLa cDNA library fused to the activation domain vector pB42AD (Clontech). GST Pulldown Assay, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot—GST pulldown assay, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (29Lee G.E. Yu E.Y. Cho C.H. Lee J. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34750-34755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, relevant proteins were expressed in cells, followed by lysis. For GST pulldown assay, lysates were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were preincubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with primary antibodies precoupled with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were washed extensively and subjected to immunoblot analyses. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using anti-TRF1 (Sigma), anti-TRF2 (Upstate), anti-CK2β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-RFP (Clontech) antibodies. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Human CK2 holoenzyme was expressed and purified from bacteria to homogeneity as described previously (30Son M.Y. Park J.W. Kim Y.S. Kang S.W. Marshak D.R. Park W. Bae Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were performed with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and GST fusion proteins as described before (31Kim Y.S. Lee J.Y. Son M.Y. Park W. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28462-28469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The samples were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. In some experiments, the reactions were supplemented with 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB, Calbiochem) as indicated. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from MCF7 cells expressing the FLAG-TRF1, and EMSA was performed as described (32Zhong Z. Shiue L. Kaplan S. de Lange T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4834-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA probes were prepared by annealing the two oligonucleotides (TTAGGG)6 and (CCCTAA)6, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4-polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and purified by free nucleotide removal spin column (Qiagen). Labeled DNA probes (0.5 ng) were incubated with nuclear extracts (6 μg of protein) and poly(dI-dC) (0.5 μg) as the nonspecific competitor (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min at 25 °C and were fractionated on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) prior to EMSA. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described (33Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 423: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed, followed by sonication to obtain chromatin fragments with an average size of 600 bp. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and supplemented with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunocomplexes were heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-links. Slot blots were hybridized with a 300-bp random-labeled TTAGGG probe or an Alu probe. The quantification of the percent precipitated DNA was done with ImageQuaNT software, and the percentage of each immunoprecipitation sample was calculated based on the signal relative to the corresponding total DNA signal. siRNA Transfections—The siRNA target sequences specific for CK2α and CK2β were 5′-AUGUCUGCCAGUGUGAUGAUGUUGG-3′ and 5′-ACACGAGGACAGUAACCAAAGUCUC-3′, respectively. Transient transfections of siRNAs were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 72 h after transfection, nuclear extracts were immunoblotted using anti-TRF1 (Sigma), anti-TRF2 (Upstate), anti-CK2α, and anti-CK2β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with mouse anti-TRF1 (Sigma) or mouse anti-TRF2 (Upstate), and rabbit anti-CK2β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Molecular Probes). DNA was stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Nano-LC and ESI MS/MS Analysis—In gel protein digestion was performed as described previously (34Kwon C. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12812-12818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ultimate Nano-LC systems, combined with a FAMOS autosampler and a Switchos II column switching valve (LC-Packings), were used as described previously (35Nam H.W. Simpson R. Kim Y.S. J. Chromatogr. B. 2005; 826: 91-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were loaded onto a pre-column, and then the Switchos II column switching device transferred the flow paths to the analytical column. The column outlet was directly coupled to the high voltage ESI source, which was interfaced to the QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Identification of CK2β as a TRF1-interacting Partner—To identify TRF1-interacting factors, we screened a HeLa cell cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. With the full-length TRF1 as bait, 26 positive clones were obtained and sequenced. One of the isolated clones was identified as CK2β (Fig. 1A). CK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation and transformation (36Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a heterotetrameric protein complex composed of two identical regulatory β subunits and two catalytic α or α′ subunits. Because the functional importance of phosphorylation in regulating the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA has not been elucidated, we were particularly interested in identification of the protein kinase that can associate with and phosphorylate TRF1. To confirm the direct interaction between TRF1 and CK2β, we performed GST pulldown experiments. GST-TRF1, but not GST-TRF2 or the control GST, precipitated endogenous CK2β from MCF7 cell extracts (Fig. 1B), indicating that TRF1 interacts with CK2β in vitro. To determine whether TRF1 and CK2β associate in vivo, MCF7 cells were transfected with FLAG-TRF1 or FLAG-TRF2 and subjected to immunoprecipitation. CK2β was detected in anti-FLAG or anti-TRF1 immunoprecipitates when FLAG-TRF1 was expressed, but not in anti-FLAG or anti-TRF2 immunoprecipitates when TRF2 was expressed (Fig. 1C). Likewise, TRF1 but not the control TRF2, was recovered in anti-CK2β immunoprecipitates. Endogenous TRF1 also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous CK2β in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that TRF1 interacts with CK2β in mammalian cells. TRF1 Is Phosphorylated by CK2 in Vitro—To examine whether CK2 catalyzes the phosphorylation of TRF1, GST-TRF1 was incubated with purified CK2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. GST-TRF1 was phosphorylated by CK2, but no phosphorylation of GST-TRF2 or the control GST was observed in the presence of CK2 (Fig. 1E). Both the α and β subunits of CK2 were autophosphorylated. The phosphorylation of TRF1 is sensitive to the CK2 inhibitor DRB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1F). Phosphorylation Is Required for the Efficient Telomere Binding of TRF1—To determine whether phosphorylation of TRF1 affects its telomere-binding activity, we performed EMSAs with nuclear extracts prepared from MCF7 cells expressing FLAG-TRF1. Nuclear extracts gave rise to a discrete protein-DNA complex that was supershifted by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). When nuclear extracts were pretreated with a λ-phosphatase that directs toward serines, threonines, and tyrosines, TRF1 binding was markedly reduced compared with untreated extracts, suggesting that the complex formation is TRF1 phosphorylation-dependent (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). When cells were treated with DRB, the complex detected in TRF1 significantly decreased (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Reduction in TRF1 binding could be due to degradation or turnover of the protein. To address this issue, we pretreated cells with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 and subsequently incubated with DRB. Incubation of cells with MG132 rescued the DRB-induced down-regulation of TRF1 binding activity (Fig. 2A, lane 7). In the absence of DRB, incubation of cells with MG132 alone did not cause a change in the level of TRF1 binding (Fig. 2A, lane 8). These results suggest that DRB-induced reduction in TRF1 complex is due to proteasome-mediated degradation of TRF1. DRB-induced reduction in TRF1 complex was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2B). Cross-linked extracts prepared from cells expressing FLAG-TRF1 or an empty vector were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The percentage of telomeric DNA bound to TRF1 was determined in slot blots using a labeled telomeric probe. Anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitated roughly 10% of total telomeric DNA in untreated control cells. However, in DRB-treated cells, telomeric DNA immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody was significantly reduced. These results indicate that the telomere binding of TRF1 requires phosphorylation by a DRB-sensitive kinase. Together with the EMSA data, these results indicate that phosphorylation of TRF1 is important for its telomere binding in cells. Inhibition of CK2 by DRB Leads to Ubiquitination and Degradation of TRF1—Because inhibition of CK2 by DRB results in a substantial decrease in the levels of TRF1 binding at telomeres, unphosphorylated TRF1 could be dissociated from telomeres and subsequently down-regulated. To investigate this possibility, MCF7 cells were transfected with FLAG-TRF1 and accessed the protein levels in the presence of DRB. FLAG-TRF1 was down-regulated in a time-dependent manner in response to DRB treatment (Fig. 3A). In contrast, FLAG-TRF2 levels were not affected by DRB treatment. To verify the ability of DRB to down-regulate endogenous TRF1 level, MCF7 cells were treated with DRB and immunoblotted using anti-TRF1 antibody. DRB treatment significantly decreased endogenous TRF1 level (data not shown). To examine whether the DRB-mediated reduction of TRF1 proceeds via the proteasome, cells were pretreated with MG132 and subsequently incubated with DRB. Incubation of cells with MG132 rescued the DRB-induced reduction of TRF1 (Fig. 3A). To examine the effect of DRB on the half-life of TRF1, MCF7 cells were incubated with cycloheximide in the absence or presence of DRB and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TRF1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, and graphically in Fig. 3C, TRF1 was turned over with a half-life of ∼2.4 h. In contrast, DRB treatment caused a clear decrease in the half-life of TRF1, indicating the higher turnover of TRF1 in response to the CK2 inhibitor. We next examine whether TRF1 is ubiquitinated in vivo prior to its degradation. MCF7 cells expressing HA-ubiquitin were treated with DRB, MG132, or both. Anti-TRF1 immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-HA antibody to illuminate ubiquitin-modified TRF1 (Fig. 3D). Ubiquitinated TRF1 was significantly elevated in the presence of MG132. This modification was further enhanced in cells treated with both MG132 and DRB, indicating that TRF1 is ubiquitinated in DRB-treated cells. Interestingly, ubiquitination of TRF2 was not observed even when both DRB and MG132 were treated (Fig. 3D). The effect of DRB on the accumulation of TRF1 on telomeres was further investigated by determining the nuclear localization of TRF1 using anti-TRF1 antibody. TRF1 staining gives a nuclear dot pattern corresponding to telomeres. DRB treatment results in loss of TRF1 from telomeres, which is illustrated by reduced fluorescent dots (Fig. 3E). When cells were incubated with both DRB and MG132, TRF1 was re-associated with telomeres. In contrast, TRF2 expression levels were not affected by DRB treatment (Fig. 3F). Note that the levels of CK2β were decreased when treated with DRB. CK2 siRNA Depletion Reduces the Level of TRF1—To demonstrate the critical role of CK2 in the regulation of TRF1 expression levels in vivo, we used small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA). Transfection of siRNAs specific for CK2α and CK2β significantly reduced the protein levels of CK2α and CK2β in MCF7 cells (Fig. 4A). We determined the effects of lowered CK2 levels on TRF1 expression. Relative to the controls, CK2α or CK2β siRNA depletion caused a marked reduction in the level of TRF1 (Fig. 4B). However, TRF2 expression level was not affected by CK2α or CK2β siRNA. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of MCF7 cells transfected with CK2β siRNA revealed the reduced fluorescent signals of CK2β compared with control cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, CK2β siRNA resulted in release of TRF1 from telomeres as indicated by decrease of the fluorescent dots of TRF1. We obtained the similar results with CK2α siRNA (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results indicate that CK2-mediated phosphorylation is important for TRF1 stability and is required for the efficient telomere binding of TRF1. CK2 Phosphorylates TRF1 on Threonine at Position 122—To determine CK2-phosphorylation sites, TRF1 was phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro and digested with trypsin (34Kwon C. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12812-12818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The peptide mixtures were separated by nano-LC and then directly introduced to a Qstar Pulsar mass spectrometer using ESI (35Nam H.W. Simpson R. Kim Y.S. J. Chromatogr. B. 2005; 826: 91-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From the peptide sequencing data, one phosphorylated peptide 122TIYICQFLTR131 located in the dimerization domain of TRF1 was detected. Unmodified and phosphorylated peptides were 80 Da different in mass (Fig. 5) and were detected with slightly different retention time in nano-LC. Compared with unmodified peptide MS/MS data, phosphorylated peptide showed the same y-ion patterns (from y1-y8) and different b-ion patterns (Fig. 5), suggesting that the phosphorylation site is located at the N terminus. From these data, we conclude that the phosphorylation site is the first threonine of the N terminus in this peptide (threonine at position 122 of TRF1). To determine the role of threonine 122 in regulating the telomere binding activity of TRF1, we generated TRF1 mutants in which the threonine residues at positions 122 and 130 were substituted by alanine (Fig. 6A). The mutant constructs were transfected to MCF7 cells, and nuclear extracts were subjected to EMSA. At the same concentrations, the wild-type and TRF1T130A proteins bound to telomere efficiently, whereas TRF1T122A and TRF1T122,130A proteins showed markedly reduced binding activities (Fig. 6B). The TRF1-telomere complexes were supershifted by anti-FLAG antibody. This diminished DNA binding of the TRF1 mutants could be due to simple disappearance of the protein or a change in its DNA binding features. To address this issue, we examined the expression levels of the TRF1 proteins present in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions. As shown in Fig. 6C, all mutants were equally expressed and exclusively localized in the nuclear fraction, indicating that TRF1 really loses its DNA binding activity when non-phosphorylated at threonine 122. We note that the amount of TRF1 carrying the T122A mutation was not decreased compared with that of wild-type TRF1 when overexpressed. To measure the effect of threonine to alanine mutations on the telomere binding activity in vivo, we determined the nuclear localization of TRF1 mutants (Fig. 6D). The wild-type and TRF1T130A accumulated at telomeres as indicated by the telomere-like dots. In contrast, TRF1T122A or TRF1T122,130A displayed markedly reduced fluorescent dots of TRF1. Together with the EMSA and immunoblot data, these results indicate that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of threonine 122 but not threonine 130 is important for efficient telomere binding of TRF1. Threonine 122 Is Important for Dimerization of TRF1 and Regulates Telomere Length—The critical question that remains to be answered is why TRF1 loses its DNA binding activity when it is non-phosphorylated. An obvious possibility would be that TRF1 dimerizes better when threonine 122 is phosphorylated. Dimerization of TRF1 has been known to be a requirement for the efficient telomere binding in vivo and in vitro (37Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To test this, coimmunoprecipitation of two differently tagged TRF1 constructs was performed with the wild-type and the mutant proteins. MCF7 cells were cotransfected with RFP-TRF1 and either FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant TRF1, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7A). Cotransfection of RFP-TRF1 and FLAG-TRF1 resulted in efficient recovery of TRF1 in both anti-RFP and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates, confirming the homodimerization between differently tagged TRF1 molecules. However, the amounts of immunoprecipitated TRF1 were significantly reduced in cells cotransfected with RFP-TRF1 plus either FLAG-TRF1T122A or FLAG-TRF1T122,130A. In contrast, FLAG-TRF1T130A does not impair its ability to interact with wild-type TRF1. These data indicate that a threonine to alanine mutation at position 122 results in diminished DNA binding due to reduced dimerization of TRF1. However, we do not exclude the possibility that TRF1 carrying the T122A mutation indeed heterodimerizes with wild-type TRF1 but targets it to degradation. According to the structural data of the TRFH domain, the 122 threonine is in the middle of helix 3 of the TRF1 dimerization domain (17Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because deletion of helix 3 does not abolish the ability of TRF1 to dimerize and bind telomeres, this residue may not be directly involved in homo-dimerization but in the folding of the domain. Thus, it is possible that the T122A mutation may impair protein folding independently of blocking a putative phosphorylation site. To test whether inhibition of CK2 indeed decreases TRF1 dimerization, we repeated coimmunoprecipitation experiments with two differently tagged wild-type TRF1 proteins in the presence of DRB. As shown in Fig. 7B, the amounts of immunoprecipitated TRF1 were significantly reduced in the presence of DRB. Finally, we examined whether phosphorylation of threonine 122 has a role in telomere length regulation. We established MCF7 cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant TRF1 proteins. TRF1 proteins were equally expressed in the nuclei as manifested by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody (see Fig. 6C). Cells expressing mutant TRF1 grew normally and exhibited no detectable differences in growth rates or morphology over 70 population doublings. Consistent with the previous findings that TRF1 negatively regulates telomere length (20van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 21Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), overexpression of the wild-type TRF1 or TRF1T130A led to a clear reduction in telomere length after 70 population doublings, although telomere shortening was not evident at 40 population doublings (Fig. 7C). In contrast, the TRF1T122A and TRF1T122,130A mutants caused an increase in telomere length. This result would be consistent with a loss of TRF1 binding to telomeric DNA and subsequent increase in telomere length. Taken together, these observations indicate that phosphorylation of threonine 122 negatively regulates telomere length by enhancing the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA. Here we describe a novel function of CK2 for regulating the telomere binding of TRF1. Identification of CK2 as a TRF1-interacting partner raises the possibility that the function of human telomeres is regulated by phosphorylation of TRF1. The results presented in this work support the hypothesis that CK2-mediated phosphorylation contributes to the efficient telomere binding of TRF1. This provides a novel and important in vivo route for regulation of telomere length homeostasis. TRF1 negatively regulates the telomere length by inhibiting access of telomerase at telomere termini (20van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 21Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein level of TRF1 at telomeres is tightly regulated. Because CK2-mediated phosphorylation enhances the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA, TRF1 phosphorylation could lead to an increase in the TRF1 level at telomeres, thereby functioning to limit uncontrolled telomere elongation in telomerase-positive cells. Consistent with this idea, the expression level of CK2 is greatly enhanced in a number of human cancers (38Daya-Makin M. Sanghera J.S. Mogentale T.L. Lipp M. Parchomchuk J. Hogg J.C. Pelech S.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2262-2268PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the presence of high levels of telomerase activity in cancer cells, telomeres do not grow in an uncontrolled manner but are, instead, stably maintained within a given size range (39Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E. Stewart N.G. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar, 40Counter C.M. Botelho F.M. Wang P. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3410-3414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased CK2 activity in human cancer cells may lead to telomerase-inaccessible configuration of telomeres and contribute to maintaining the telomere length at a constant average value. Inhibition of CK2 results in the non-phosphorylated form of TRF1, which in turn leads to a decrease in its DNA binding activity. This diminished DNA binding could be due to release of TRF1 from telomeres or due to its degradation. In the EMSA data, λ-phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts from cells transfected with FLAG-tagged TRF1 led to a reduced TRF1 binding to telomeric DNA (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, TRF1 mutation with a threonine to alanine change at position 122 resulted in diminished DNA binding under the conditions that the wild-type and mutant TRF1s were equally expressed (Fig. 6). These data indicate that TRF1 loses its DNA binding activity when non-phosphorylated. On the other hand, inhibition of CK2 by DRB yields less TRF1-telomere binding activity due to its degradation by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 3). However, this effect is rescued by MG132, which suggests that TRF1 can bind DNA even when non-phosphorylated by CK2. Based on these data, we conclude that dephosphorylation of TRF1 induced by CK2 inhibitor releases TRF1 from telomeres. The resulting telomere-unbound form of TRF1 is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, thereby preventing its rapid re-association with telomeres. However, in the presence of both DRB and MG132, non-phosphorylated TRF1 is not degraded and readily re-associates with telomeres because non-phosphorylated TRF1 is still capable of binding telomeric DNA, although its activity is weak. As shown in the results of EMSA and immunofluorescence experiments (Figs. 2A and 3E), DRB did not completely abolish DNA binding activity of TRF1. In addition to TRF1 phosphorylation by CK2, it has been previously reported that ATM interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 in response to ionizing DNA damage (41Kishi S. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7420-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because cells with ATM mutations display accelerated telomere shortening to ionizing radiation (42Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 43Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of TRF1 by ATM might be involved in regulation of telomere length. Moreover, overexpression of TRF1 results in accelerated telomere shortening, a phenotype similar to that of ATM mutations (44Metcalfe J.A. Parkhill J. Campbell L. Stacey M. Biggs P. Byrd P.J. Taylor A.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although the effect of phosphorylation of TRF1 by ATM on the telomere binding has not been investigated, ATM may reduce the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA during DNA damage response. In contrast, phosphorylation of TRF1 by CK2 leads to an increase in TRF1-telomere binding. Recently, it has been reported that Xenopus TRF1 (xTRF1) dynamically associates with mitotic telomere chromatin and dissociates from interphase telomere chromatin (45Nishiyama A. Muraki K. Saito M. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Ishikawa F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, xTRF1 is phosphorylated by polo-like kinase, and its phosphorylation is required for the efficient xTRF1 association with telomeres. These findings suggest that polo-like kinase regulates telomere configuration in a cell cycle-dependent manner. During S phase, xTRF1 is dephosphorylated and released from telomeres to form a telomerase-accessible configuration, whereas the telomere association of xTRF1 in M phase leads to a telomerase-inaccessible configuration. In a similar way, CK2 may regulate TRF1 recruitment to human telomere chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Although CK2 participates in the regulation of various stages of the cell cycle progression, the mitotic phosphorylation of CK2 targets, including topoisomerase II and transcription factor Six1, was detected in mammalian cells (46Escargueil A.E. Plisov S.Y. Filhol O. Cochet C. Larsen A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34710-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 47Ford H.L. Landesman-Bollag E. Dacwag C.S.

Thus, cell cycle-dependent TRF1 recruitment to telomeres regulated by CK2 should be addressed in future studies. Telomere length is regulated by tankyrases through its interaction with TRF1 (21Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Tankyrase 1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates TRF1 and releases it from telomeres, allowing access of telomerase to telomeres and subsequently telomere elongation (22Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 23Smith S. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thus, tankyrase 1 is a positive regulator of telomere length. On the contrary, CK2 interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1, and CK2-mediated phosphorylation enhances the ability of TRF1 to bind telomeric DNA, suggesting a role of CK2 as a negative regulator of telomere length. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that overexpression of the wild-type TRF1, but not TRF1T122A or TRF1T122,130A, led to shortened telomeres (Fig. 7B). Based on these results, we propose a model where two counteracting processes may determine the levels of TRF1 binding at telomeres: tankyrase 1 as a releasing factor and CK2 as a binding factor. The dynamic balance between these two proteins may regulate the telomere configurations in a cell-cycle-dependent manner by determining the equilibrium level of TRF1 at telomeres, thus maintaining telomere length at a constant average length. TRF2 may constitutively remain at the telomere chromatin throughout the cell cycle due to its protective role of telomeres (24Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 45Nishiyama A. Muraki K. Saito M. Ohsumi K. Kishimoto T. Ishikawa F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, we did not observe ubiquitination of TRF2 when both DRB and MG132 were treated (Fig. 3D). When TRF1 is dissociated from telomeres by either inhibition of CK2 or activation of tankyrase 1, telomerase can gain access to the TRF1-free telomeres to elongate the chromosome termini. Subsequent ubiquitination/degradation of TRF1 prevents its rapid re-association with telomeres. Consistent with a previous report (24Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), our results suggest that telomeres are re-assembled with newly synthesized TRF1 rather than the dissociated telomere-unbound form to establish telomerase-inaccessible telomeres. Thus, sequential post-translational modifications of TRF1, including phosphorylation by CK2, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrases, and ubiquitination by Fbx4 (48Lee T.H. Perrem K. Harper J.W. Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 759-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), play important roles in modulating telomere length homeostasis by determining the levels of TRF1 at telomeres. We thank Jong-Bok Yoon and members of the Chung laboratory for helpful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1969171797,"Mutations in the BRCA1-interacting DEAH helicase Brip1 confer an increased risk of breast cancer. In the present study we aimed to unravel the transcriptional control of Brip1 and to determine its expression levels in a set of 101 primary invasive breast carcinomas. Transcription of Brip1 was found to be cell growth-related and controlled by the E2F/retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway through a conserved E2F-responsive site. Repression of Brip1 expression by the cell growth-inhibiting compound 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 depended on this same E2F-responsive site. In spite of its role as a tumor suppressor, both quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses and immunohistochemical stainings showed significantly elevated Brip1 expression levels in grade 3 tumors as compared to grade 1 or 2 carcinomas. Furthermore, increased Brip1 transcript levels were found in tumors with an estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative or HER-2-positive status. In conclusion, these data show that Brip1 is a genuine target gene for the E2F/Rb pathway and that elevated expression levels of Brip1 are detected in primary invasive breast carcinomas with unfavorable characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W1973678711,"Phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP, also known as StarD2) is a highly specific intracellular lipid binding protein with accentuated expression in oxidative tissues. Here we show that decreased plasma concentrations of glucose and free fatty acids in fasting PC-TP-deficient (Pctp(-/-)) mice are attributable to increased hepatic insulin sensitivity. In hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, Pctp(-/-) mice exhibited profound reductions in hepatic glucose production, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and glucose cycling. These changes were explained in part by the lack of PC-TP expression in liver per se and in part by marked alterations in body fat composition. Reduced respiratory quotients in Pctp(-/-) mice were indicative of preferential fatty acid utilization for energy production in oxidative tissues. In the setting of decreased hepatic fatty acid synthesis, increased clearance rates of dietary triglycerides and increased hepatic triglyceride production rates reflected higher turnover in Pctp(-/-) mice. Collectively, these data support a key biological role for PC-TP in the regulation of energy substrate utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1989085193,"GPR20 was isolated as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor from genomic DNA by PCR amplification. Although GPR20 was closely related to nucleotide or lipid receptors, the functional role of this receptor, as well as its endogenous ligand, remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that GPR20 is constitutively active in the absence of ligand, leading to continuous activation of its coupled G proteins. When GPR20 was exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells, both the basal level and the prostaglandin E2-induced production of cAMP were significantly decreased. A remarkable increase in [35S]guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding to membrane preparations was also observed in GPR20-expressing cells. These effects of GPR20 overexpression were diminished in cells treated with pertussis toxin, suggesting that the expression of GPR20 results in the activation of Gi/o proteins. Involvement of GPR20 in the activation of Gi/o proteins was also supported by evidence that the disruption of a conserved DRY motif in GPR20 attenuated both [35S]GTPγS incorporation and inhibition of the prostaglandin E2-induced cAMP production. Knockdown of GPR20 in PC12h cells resulted in an elevation of the basal cAMP level, suggesting that the endogenous GPR20 achieves a constitutively or spontaneously active conformation. Furthermore, enhancement of [3H]thymidine incorporation was also observed in the GPR20-silencing cells, implying that the GPR20 expression seems to attenuate PC12h cell growth. Taken together, these data indicate that GPR20 constitutively activates Gi proteins without ligand stimulation.

Despite the vast and longstanding efforts of academic and industrial researchers to pair GPCRs with potential ligands, more than 150 nonsensory GPCRs still remain orphan receptors, for which the cognate ligands have not yet been identified (1Civelli O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because GPCRs have proven particularly amenable to modulation by small molecules and are the targets of approximately half of currently marketed prescription drugs, the nonsensory GPCRs are clearly important therapeutic targets (2Drews J. Science. 2000; 287: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). Consequently, the orphan GPCRs constitute a vast reservoir of potential drug targets for therapeutic development. Indeed, numerous research groups, including ours, work on characterizing these receptors. GPR20 is one of the orphan GPCRs that has been identified from human genomic DNA by PCR amplification using primers based on the sequences of the opioid/somatostatin-related receptors, GPR7 and GPR8 (3Odowd B.F.

The expression of human GPR20 has been detected in several brain regions, including the caudate nuclei, putamen, and the thalamus (3Odowd B.F. Nguyen T. Jung B.P. Marchese A. Cheng R. Heng H.H.Q. Kolakowski L.F. Lynch K.R. George S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A recently disclosed patent demonstrated that GPR20-deficient mice exhibited a hyperactivity disorder characterized by an increase in total distance traveled in an open field test (4Brennan, T. J., Matthews, W., and Moore, M. (January 23, 2003) U. S. Patent 0018989Google Scholar), implying a substantial role of GPR20 in neurophysiological function. However, the physiological mechanisms of GPR20 action, including the identification of natural ligands for GPR20, have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we show that GPR20 has the potential to constitutively activate Gi-type G proteins without extracellular ligands. Furthermore, the physiological relevance of this constitutive activation of GPR20 was confirmed by RNA interference experiments and mitogenic response assays.

The phylogenetic tree was generated from the amino acid sequences of these GPCRs using the all-against-all matching method (available on line). The tree was constructed on the basis of point-accepted mutation distances between each pair of sequences estimated by the dynamic programming algorithm. Construction of the Human GPR20 and BLT1-expressing Plasmids—A DNA fragment containing the human GPR20 (hGPR20) gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_005293) was obtained from human genomic DNA by PCR amplification using the sense primer, 5′-ATGGAGAAGGGGGATGCTGGGC-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-TTCAGGCCACCACATCCCATCG-3′. For construction of the hGPR20 expression plasmid, the entire open reading frame of hGPR20 was amplified from the above DNA fragment by PCR using the sense primer, 5′-CAGGATATCCCCTCTGTGTCTCCAGCGGG-3′, and the antisense primer, 5′-CAGGAATTCCTAAGCCTCGGGCCCATTAG-3′, and subcloned into the EcoRV and EcoRI sites of the pCXN2.1-FLAG vector, a modified version of pCXN2 (5Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, designated pCXN2.1-FLAG-GPR20, was used to express an N-terminally FLAG-tagged hGPR20. For construction of the expression plasmid for human leukotriene B4 type 1 receptor (hBLT1, GenBank™ accession number NM_181657), an entire open reading frame of hBLT1 was subcloned into the pCXN2.1-FLAG vector. Construction of Short Hairpin RNA-expressing Plasmids–Oligonucleotides for the construction of three short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids directed against rat GPR20 (rGPR20) mRNA were designed using the siDirect small interfering RNA design system provided by the RNAi Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The designed sequences are as follows: sh1 sense, 5′-GATCCCCCATCGTCTACTGTTTTATTCAAGAGATAAAACAGTAGACGATGGGGTA-3′, and sh1-antisense, 5′-AGCTTACCCCATCGTCTACTGTTTTATCTCTTGAATAAAACAGTAGACGATGGGG-3′; sh2 sense, 5′-GATCCGACCCTGTCTGTATTGGGTTTCAAGAGAACCCAATACAGACAGGGTCACA-3′, and sh2 antisense, 5′-AGCTTGTGACCCTGTCTGTATTGGGTTCTCTTGAAACCCAATACAGACAGGGTCG-3′; and sh3 sense, 5′-GATCCCTCAGCACCGGTTCTCACATTATTCAAGAGATGTGAGAACCGGTGCTGAGGAA-3′, and sh3 antisense, 5′-AGCTTTCCTCAGCACCGGTTCTCACATCTCTTGAATAATGTGAGAACCGGTGCTGAGG-3′. After annealing the sense and antisense oligonucleotides, the resultant DNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pSilencer 4.1-CMV hygro vector (purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), abbreviated pSilencer), giving rise to three rGPR20-shRNA plasmids, pSilencer-sh1, pSilencer-sh2, and pSilencer-sh3. We used a negative control-shRNA plasmid supplied by Ambion as a control scrambled shRNA. Construction of a Mutant hGPR20 (R148A) Plasmid—Mutagenesis of GPR20 was performed via site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions, with the exception that the KOD Plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) was used for PCR amplification. pCXN2.1-FLAG-GPR20 was used as a template plasmid, and the primers for mutagenesis were as follows: R148A sense, 5′-CTGCATCTGCGTGGACgccTACCTGGCCATCGTG-3′, and R148A antisense, 5′-CACGATGGCCAGGTAggcGTCCACGCAGATGCAG-3′. The resultant construct was verified through complete DNA sequencing of both DNA strands.

The Cys351 residues of the Gi1 and Gi2 proteins and the Cys352 residue in the Gi3 protein were substituted with a Gly residue by PCR amplification. Next, an EcoRI site was created between Ile93 and Asp94 within the helical domain of each Gi protein by site-directed mutagenesis. A GFP sequence, bearing two Gly-rich linker sequences, Gly-Asn-Ser-Gly-Gly at the N-terminal end and Gly-Gly-Gly-Asn-Ser at the C-terminal end (9Ayoub M. Maurel D. Binet V. Fink M. Prézeau L. Ansanay H. Pin J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), was inserted into the EcoRI site created in each Gi protein. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained under 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). PC12h cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 in serum-free Opti-MEM I according to the manufacturer's description. Establishment of Cells Stably Expressing hGPR20—HEK293 cells were transfected with pCXN2.1-FLAG-GPR20 and cultured for 30 days in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml G418. These cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG (M5) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% goat serum for 30 min, followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG in PBS/2% goat serum for 15 min. Transformants highly expressing FLAG-hGPR20, designated HEK293-GPR20 cells, were collected as a polyclonal population by cell sorting using an EPICS ALTRA instrument (Beckman Coulter) and maintained in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml G418. Flow cytometric analyses of the FLAG-hGPR20-expressing cells were performed using an EPICS XL instrument (Beckman Coulter). cAMP Measurement—HEK293 and PC12h cells (5–8 × 104 cells) were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates (for HEK293, BD Biosciences) or collagen-coated 96-well plates (for PC12h, Iwaki) for 24 h. In some experiments, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 6 h. Cells were washed twice with buffer A (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1% BSA) and preincubated in 100 μl of buffer A containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (from a 500 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide stored at –30 °C) for 15 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, various concentrations of PGE2 in buffer A (100 μl) were added, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10% Tween 20 (20 μl), followed by overnight storage at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, the cAMP concentrations in the supernatants (10 μl) were measured using an AlphaScreen cAMP assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of the basal cAMP concentration in nonstimulated cells, a cAMP Biotrak EIA system was used. Cells were processed as described above, with the exception of the addition of 25 μl of lysis buffer supplied in the EIA kit to terminate the reactions. Membrane Preparation—Two days after transfection, cells were harvested with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 6 h. The cells were disrupted by sonication in ice-cold sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm EDTA) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer and subjected to [35S]GTPγS binding experiments. The protein concentrations in each sample were determined by the Bradford method (11Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—Membrane preparations (10 μg of protein) were incubated in 100 μl of [35S]GTPγS binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm GDP, and 0.1% BSA) containing 0.5 nm [35S]GTPγS for 30 min at 30 °C. To determine nonspecific binding, unlabeled GTPγS was added to the binding mixture to a final concentration of 10 μm. Bound [35S]GTPγS was separated from free [35S]GTPγS by rapid filtration through GF/C filters and washed with 2 ml of ice-cold TMN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl). Radioactivity was measured using a Top Count scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—First-strand cDNAs from 16 human tissues were purchased from Clontech (human multiple tissue cDNA panel I and II). To examine the expression of hGPR20 in human tissues, the amount of the GPR20 cDNA in each sample was evaluated using a TaqMan gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA; assay code Hs00271049_s1) and the modified TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix containing 0.01% BSA. The amount of cDNA was estimated using a LightCycler apparatus (Roche Diagnostics) and the Fit Points method in the LightCycler analysis software. For each evaluation, a specific standard curve was made using a series of dilutions from the corresponding cDNA. Mouse total RNAs were prepared from various tissues using an Absolutely RNA miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA), and first strand cDNAs were synthesized using Superscript II. PCR amplifications were carried out in microcapillary tubes, in 20-μl reaction volumes consisting of 2 μl of cDNA solution, 1× FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.5 μm each of the forward and the reverse primers. A 194-bp fragment of the mouse GPR20 (mGPR20) cDNA was generated using following primers: forward primer, 5′-AAACCCAACCAGAAGAGTTCACC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AAATGCCAACCAGATACCCAAGT-3′. Evaluation of GPR20 Expression in Various Cell Lines—Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan), followed by purification of mRNAs using a poly (A)+ isolation kit (Nippon Gene). cDNA was generated from 100 ng of the purified mRNA using Superscript II and random hexamer primers. A 187-bp fragment of hGPR20, a 194-bp fragment of mGPR20, and a 197-bp fragment of rGPR20 were generated by PCR. The primers used in these analyses were as follows: hGPR20 sense primer, 5′-GCTGGCGCTGTACGTCTTCT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CATGTTGAGGAAGTAACCGAGGA-3′; and rGPR20, sense primer, 5′-GTCCTGGGCTACTTCCTCAACAT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CCACCAGTCTTCACACCCAATAC-3′. The primers for mGPR20 were the same as described above. The primer sequences for β-actin were as follows: human, sense primer, 5′-CAGGATGCAGAAGGAGATCACTG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACAT-3′; rat, sense primer, 5′-AGACCTCTATGCCAACACAGTGC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-ATAGAGCCACCAATCCACACAGA-3′; and mouse, sense primer, 5′-CACAGGCATTGTGATGGAC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CTTCTGCATCCTGTCAGC-3′. Validation of RNA Interference—To validate the efficiency of the rGPR20-knockdown by pSilencer-sh1, pSilencer-sh2, or pSilencer-sh3, quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed. Seven days after transfection of these plasmids into PC12h cells, mRNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as described above. Using the resultant cDNAs, the amounts of expressed rGPR20 and β-actin mRNAs were estimated using LightCycler Fast Start DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In these experiments, the primers for β-actin were the same as described above. For each evaluation, a specific standard curve was made using a series of dilutions of the corresponding cDNA. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—PC12h cells (1 × 104 cells) were cultured on collagen-coated 96-well plates for 48 h. Each well was pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]methyl thymidine in the last 6 h of a 48-h culture. At the end of incubation, the cells were lysed using water, and incorporated [3H]thymidine was separated from free [3H]thymidine by rapid filtration through GF/C filters that were washed with 2 ml of water. The radioactivity was measured with a Top Count scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into PC12h DNA was expressed as dpm per well. Cloning of the hGPR20 Gene—We cloned human GPR20 from human genomic DNA by PCR amplification. However, several sequences in our cloned hGPR20 were different from the reported GPR20 sequence (3Odowd B.F. Nguyen T. Jung B.P. Marchese A. Cheng R. Heng H.H.Q. Kolakowski L.F. Lynch K.R. George S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In particular, Cys53–Val54 and Ala157–Pro158–Ala159–Ala160 in the reported GPR20 were Trp53–Leu54 and Gly157–Ser158–Arg159–Arg160, respectively, in our clone. We used our hGPR20 clone in this study, because we verified the sequences of several independently isolated hGPR20 clones, and the same sequence was recently deposited in the human total genome sequence data base at NCBI (accession number NT_008046). The primary structure of hGPR20 exhibited 82.8 and 81.4% amino acid identity to mouse and rat GPR20, respectively (Fig. 1A). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that hGPR20 was closely related to functional receptors for nucleotides or lipids (e.g. TG1019, CysLT1, CysLT2, LPA4, LPA5, GPR34, and PAF receptors, Fig. 1B), raising the possibility that GPR20 may recognize nucleotides or lipids as ligands. Tissue and Cellular Expression of GPR20 mRNA—Using cDNAs prepared from 16 human tissues, qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of hGPR20. In these tissues, hGPR20 was ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression in small intestine (Fig. 2A). Similarly, mouse GPR20 mRNA was detected in a broad range of tissues with abundant expression in intestinal tissues, such as small intestine and colon (Fig. 2B). GPR20 mRNA was detected in various cell lines, including N1E115 (mouse neuroblastoma cells), B103 (rat neuroblastoma cells), PC12 and PC12h (rat pheochromocytoma cells), U937 (human histiocytic lymphoma cells), HL60 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells), and COLO320 (human colon adenocarcinoma cells), expressed detectable levels of the GPR20 mRNA (Fig. 2C). One of these cell lines, PC12h, was used for the GPR20-knockdown experiments shown below. Reduction of cAMP Formation by the Expression of hGPR20—Because GPR20 belongs to a family of lipid/nucleotide-recognizing receptors, we carried out a ligand screening using the BioMol Screen-Well™ Bioactive Lipid Library (purchased from BioMol) and 17 nucleotides (Sigma). To facilitate this screening, we constructed an expression plasmid producing an N-terminally FLAG-tagged hGPR20 (FLAG-hGPR20) and established a HEK293 cell line stably expressing FLAG-hGPR20 (HEK293-GPR20 cells). Prior to screening, expression of FLAG-hGPR20 on the cell surface of HEK293-GPR20 cells was validated by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3A). Although we evaluated the agonistic activity of 198 lipids and 17 nucleotides using HEK293-GPR20 cells by monitoring intracellular calcium mobilization and cAMP formation, none of them was an effective agonist for hGPR20 (data not shown). Furthermore, FLAG-hGPR20 did not respond to changes in the extracellular pH (data not shown), even though GPR20 is closely related to the four proton-sensing GPCRs, i.e. G2A, GPR4, OGR1, and TDAG8 (12Ludwig M.

Additionally, we did not observe any activation of GPR20 by several steroid hormones, including hydrocortisone, corticosterone, β-estradiol, and progesterone (data not shown). During the course of these experiments, we unexpectedly detected a modest but significant decrease in basal cAMP level in HEK293-GPR20 cells, compared with that of vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we observed that the FLAG-hGPR20 expression resulted in attenuated PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation in comparison with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). Similar effects were observed in HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-hGPR20 (Fig. 3E), implying that these observations were not an artifact of the cloned cell lines. Because the above effects by FLAG-hGPR20 expression were abolished by treatment with PTX (Fig. 3, B, D and E), exogenous expression of hGPR20 may cause the activation of PTX-sensitive G proteins in the absence of ligand stimulation. Enhanced [35S]GTPγS Binding to Membranes Prepared from hGPR20-expressing Cells—Next we examined whether Gi-type G proteins are indeed activated in the presence of hGPR20. Using membrane preparations from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with various amounts of the FLAG-hGPR20 expression plasmid, we evaluated GDP-GTP exchange of Gα-subunits by [35S]GTPγS binding assay. Because exogenously expressed GPCRs occasionally activate G protein in the absence of ligands, we compared the effect of hGPR20 with hBLT1, which is well known as a Gi-coupled receptor (16Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 17Kuniyeda K. Okuno T. Terawaki K. Miyano M. Yokomizo T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3998-4006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of hGPR20 enhanced [35S]GTPγS incorporation into the membranes in a dose-dependent manner, even though hBLT1 did not affect the [35S]GTPγS incorporation at these doses. The augmentation of [35S]GTPγS binding was diminished by PTX treatment (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with the PTX sensitivity of PGE2-induced cAMP formation in GPR20-transfected cells (Fig. 3, B–E). To provide further evidence for the activation of Gi proteins by hGPR20, we examined whether [35S]GTPγS incorporation into exogenously expressed PTX-resistant mutants of the Gi protein (the Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3) (6Hunt T.

As shown in Fig. 4C, even in cells pretreated with PTX, increasing [35S]GTPγS binding to the PTX-resistant mutants of Gi proteins was observed in the FLAG-hGPR20-expressing cells. These results suggest that hGPR20 continuously activates Gi-type G proteins. Involvement of the DRY Motif of GPR20 in Activation of Gi Proteins—Several reports have described the significance of a highly conserved stretch of amino acid residues located in the second intracellular loop of various GPCRs, (Glu/Asp)-Arg-Tyr, in G protein activation (18Probst W. Snyder L. Schuster D. Brosius J. Sealfon S. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 19Savarese T. Fraser C. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This domain is generally designated the DRY motif. To obtain more evidence for the constitutive activation of Gi proteins by GPR20, we examined whether the disruption of the DRY motif in hGPR20 (amino acids 147–149) affects Gi activation. We constructed a mutant FLAG-hGPR20, the R148A receptor, in which Asp148 is substituted by Ala. The R148A receptor was expressed on the cell surface at levels similar to the wild-type FLAG-hGPR20, as judged by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, [35S]GTPγS incorporation into membrane preparations from R148A receptor-expressing cells was remarkably reduced compared with membranes from cells expressing the wild-type receptor. Additionally, the R148A receptor was not able to inhibit PGE2-induced cAMP formation (Fig. 5C). All these results indicate that GPR20 is constitutively activated on the cell surface, leading to sustained activation of Gi proteins, and that the DRY motif in hGPR20 plays a key role in activation of Gi. Increase in Basal cAMP Levels by Silencing of Endogenously Expressed GPR20—Although we showed that overexpression of GPR20 resulted in constitutive activation of Gi proteins, those data were obtained by using overexpression systems. Therefore, we next examined whether or not a physiological expression level of GPR20 is enough to evoke the constitutive activation of Gi proteins. For this purpose, we performed an RNAi experiment using PC12h cells that endogenously express GPR20 (Fig. 2C). We constructed three shRNA plasmids, pSilencer-sh"

Furthermore, a host of solid and hematopoietic tumor types exhibit constitutive activation of NF-κB (Basseres, D. S., and Baldwin, A. S. (2006) 25, 6817-6830). However, the mechanism for this constitutive activation of NF-κB has not been elucidated in the tumors. We have previously shown that NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) protein and its association with Inhibitor of κB kinase αβ are elevated in melanoma cells compared with their normal counterpart, leading to constitutive activation of NF-κB. Moreover, expression of dominant negative NIK blocked this base-line NF-κB activity in melanoma cells. Of the three receptors that require NIK for activation of NF-κB, only the lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβ-R) is expressed in melanoma. We show in this manuscript that for melanoma there is a strong relationship between expression of the LTβ-R and constitutive NF-κB transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that activation of the LTβ-R can drive NF-κB activity to regulate gene expression that leads to enhanced cell growth. The inhibition by LTβ-R shRNA resulted in decreased NF-κB promoter activity, decreased growth, and decreased invasiveness as compared with control. These results indicate that the LTβ-R constitutively induces NF-κB activation, and this event may be associated with autonomous growth of melanoma cells.

Amiri K.I. Burke J.R. Schmid J.A. Richmond A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, broad targeting of NF-κBasa therapeutic measure for treatment in the clinic has its draw-backs due to effects on the immune system. NF-κ-inducing kinase (NIK) is an upstream kinase in the NF-κB activation pathway and preferentially phosphorylates IKKα over IKKβ, leading to the activation of IKKα kinase activity (5Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 6Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). It belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases including NIK, MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK1-4), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), Raf and others (7Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Originally NIK was identified as a binding partner for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 inflammatory receptor and was demonstrated to be a key element of the NF-κB signaling pathway in response to TNF, interleukin-1, and CD95 (8Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Initial studies of the function of NIK, in which the consequences of overexpression of this kinase or its mutants were assessed, suggested that NIK mediates activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway and does so in response to multiple inducers with many different physiological functions (9Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, later studies of mice of the aly strain, which express a non-functional NIK mutant, challenged the notion that NIK has a functional role in the activities of most of these inducers (10Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a complete disruption of the NIK gene (nik-/-) leads to a phenotype that is reminiscent of lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβ-R) knock-out mice (11Futterer A. Mink K. Luz A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Pfeffer K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Indeed, cells from nik-/- mice showed a normal response to TNF-α or interleukin-1 treatment, whereas NF-κB activation in reaction to LTβ was impaired. Thus, it was suggested that NIK participates selectively in the activation of NF-κB by a restricted set of ligands that specifically affect the development and function of lymphocytes. The aly/aly mice show a cell-autonomous defect in B-cell function in addition to the traits associated with the ltβ-R-/- phenotype (12Karrer U. Althage A. Odermatt B. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2799-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Yamada T. Mitani T. Yorita K. Uchida D. Matsushima A. Iwamasa K. Fujita S. Matsumoto M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown two other ligand/receptor pairs are also involved in NIK signaling, CD40/CD40L and Baff/BaffR, which are expressed primarily on B cells (14Dejardin E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1161-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The LTβ-R, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is expressed on the surface of many cell types, including cells of epithelial and myeloid lineages. To date, there are two known cytokines capable of transducing signal through LTβ-R. The first is lymphotoxin α1β2, a cell bound heterotrimeric complex of LTα and LTβ. The second cytokine, LIGHT, is a membrane-anchored homotrimeric complex capable of binding LTβ-R and herpes simplex virus entry mediator HVEM (15Mauri D.N. Ebner R. Montgomery R.I. Kochel K.D.

It has been shown that signaling triggered by LTβ-R is required for the genesis of Peyerŉs patches and lymph nodes based on the observation that Peyerŉs patches and lymph nodes are deficient in LTβ-R gene-deleted mice (11Futterer A.

Immunol. 1999; 17: 399-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). It has been shown that LTβ-R can bind TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, 3, and 5 but not TRAF6 (17Inoue J. Ishida T.

Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14029-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that NIK basal expression as well as IKK-associated NIK activity is higher in melanoma cells compared with normal melanocytes (20Dhawan P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the present report we demonstrate that LTβ-R is an upstream modulator of the NF-κB pathway in melanoma cell lines and melanocytic lesions and, thus, may be an important receptor for progression and metastasis of human melanomas. Plasmids and Reagents—Rabbit lymphotoxin-β receptor antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). LTβ-R receptor agonistic antibody was obtained from Jeffrey Browning, Biogen (Cambridge, MA) (36Lukashev M. LePage D. Wilson C. Bailly V. Garger E. Lukashin A. Ngam-ek A. Zeng W. Allaire N. Perrin S.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9617-9624Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the LTβ receptor-Fc chimera as well as the LIGHT ELISA kit was obtained from R&D Systems (629-LR) (Minneapolis, MN). The NF-κB luciferase reporter vector contains five tandem repeats of the NF-κB element 5′ to the transcription initiation site and is contained in pLUC-MCS reporter vector (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture and Transfection—The human melanoma cell lines Hs294T, SKMel5, SKMel28, and WM115 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs) established from foreskin were obtained from the Skin Disease Research Center core facility at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Retinal pigmented epithelial cells and melanoma cells were grown as described previously (21Dhawan P. Singh A.B. Ellis D.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7335-7342PubMed Google Scholar). NHEM cells were cultured in medium 154 supplemented with human melanocyte growth supplement (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR). One day before transfection, the cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates to provide a final density of 40-60% confluence (∼3 × 105 cells/well). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Fold stimulation was calculated for each sample by dividing the normalized luciferase activity by the value obtained from the control transfection containing empty parental expression vectors (pCMV). The luciferase stimulation assays were performed on cells cultured in low serum (0.2% FBS) or serum-free medium. Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were obtained according to our standard protocol and probed with appropriate antibodies as described previously (20Dhawan P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The LTβ-R antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The antibodies were visualized with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Diagnostics) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluoresence—Paraffin-fixed tissue samples were obtained from melanoma and normal tissues of patients using protocols approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board. All melanocytic lesion diagnoses on tissues used in these studies were made independently by dermatopathologists who were not involved in the study. Criteria for the diagnosis of dysplastic nevi were those adopted by the 1992 NIH Consensus Conference. This diagnosis requires both (a) architectural disorder and (b) melanocytic atypia, which is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluoresence was performed using standard protocol (21Dhawan P. Singh A.B. Ellis D.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7335-7342PubMed Google Scholar), then immunostained for LTβ-R with goat-anti LTβ-R (1:50, Santa Cruz, Temecula, CA). All primary antibody incubations were performed in a moisture chamber overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rabbit Texas Red and anti-goat Alexa 488. The slides were fixed with Vectashield and sealed with clear nail polish. Stained sections were viewed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope. The excitation wavelength was 549 nm for Texas Red and 488 nm for Alexa 488. MTT Assay—Hs294T and SKMel28 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured in 1 ml of DMEM/F-12, 0.2% FBS. LTβ-R-agonist antibody (2 and 10 μg/ml) and LTβ-R-Fc (2 and 10 μg/ml) were supplemented in culture media of some wells to evaluate their effects on cell growth. Triplicate culture wells were set up for each treatment. At each time point, 100 μl of a 5 mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The plates were placed in TH-4 swinging bucket holders and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min in a Beckman centrifuge. The supernatant media were removed. Then 700 μl of DMSO were added to each well and incubated for a further 15 min on a rotator. The plates were centrifuged again, and 650 μl of supernatant of each well was transferred to a cuvette and optical density at 570 nm was measured. The growth curve over a period of 72 h was plotted. RT-PCR—Cells were washed three times with PBS followed by cell lysis with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was purified following the instructions of the manufacturer by phase separation and precipitation with chloroform and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. After washing once with 75% ethanol and brief drying, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water. RT was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript II RT-PCR kit, and 5 μl of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with oligo(dt) as primer. One microliter of the cDNA mix and specific primers (for human LTβ-R, sense 5′-CTACCTGAC-CATCTGCCAGCTGTG-3′ and antisense 5′-CAGGGAAG-TATGGATGGGCCTTCG-3′; for human LTα, primer 1 sense 5′-CCACCCTACACCTCCTCCTT-3′, primer 2 sense 5′-CTCAAACCTGCTGCTCACCT-3′, and antisense 5′-CGAAGGCTCCAAAGAAGACAGTACT-3′; for human LTβ, sense 5′-GACTGGGGTTTCAGAAGCTG-3′ and antisense 5′-TCAGAAACGCCTGTTCCTTC-3′) were used for further PCR amplification of human LTβ-R, LTα and LTβ with TaqDNA polymerase (Sigma) at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s for 30 cycles. The products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. ELISA for LIGHT—Human LIGHT expressions in the conditioned media of melanocyte and melanoma cell cultures were assessed by an ELISA kit (R & D Systems). All the procedures were followed according to the kit instructions. Briefly, three melanocyte and three melanoma cell lines were cultured in 12-well plates in DMEM/F-12 media containing 10% FBS overnight. The media were then switched to serum-free media, and cells were cultured overnight. The culture media were collected and subjected to ELISA assay for LIGHT expression. For each cell line, three samples were collected from triplicate wells, and LIGHT concentrations were indicated as the mean ± S.E. LTβ-R Gene Knockdown by shRNA—Human melanoma cell line Hs294T was cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS. Lentiviral shRNAmir vector pGIPZ with either targeting sequence for knocking-down human LTβ-R (clone ID: V2LHS_134097) or non-silencing control sequence was obtained from Vanderbilt Microarray Shared Resource and transfected into Hs294T cells with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent following the manufacturerŉs instruction. After 48 h cells were cultured in 0.5 mg/ml puromycin-containing media for selecting pGIPZ vector-expressing cells. By gradually increasing the concentration of puromycin to 3 mg/ml and after 3-4 weeks of culture, vector-encoded GFP expression was observed in all Hs294T cells. Expression of LTβ-R in the above two vector-transfected cells was characterized by RT-PCR, Western blot, and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. FACS on LTβ-R Expression—One million melanoma cells were harvested by incubating cells with PBS-based dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, 0.1% BSA and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, 0.1% BSA containing either 1:50-diluted phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human LTβ-R monoclonal antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) or PE-conjugated isotypic IgG control (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). After incubation on ice for 1 h, cells were washed with PBS, 0.1%BSA twice, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, 0.1% BSA containing 1:1000 diluted 7-aminoactinomycin D (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and incubated for 15 min followed by FACS analysis. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). One microgram of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis RT-PCR kit (Bio-Rad) according to the user manual. The resulting cDNA was then amplified through quantitative real-time PCR by using iQ Real Time Sybr Green PCR supermix (Bio-Rad) and Bio-Rad IcyclerIQ Multicolor Real-time PCR detection system. cDNA levels were normalized to actin amplified with the primers 5′-caccacaccttctacaatgag-3′ and 5′-atagcacagcctggatagc-3′ The primers for VCAM and SDF1 were as published in PMID 127135952 and PMID 17108103, respectively (VCAM, 5′-CATGGAATTCGAACCCAAACA-3′, and 5′-GGCTGACCAAGACGGTTGTATC-3′; SDF1, 5′-GATTGTAGCCCGGCTGAAGA-3′, and 5′-TTCGGGTCAATGCACACTTGT-3′). Invasion Assay—Transwells (8-μm pore size, 6.5 mm in diameter) from Costar (Cambridge, MA) were coated with 100 μl of 100 μg/ml collagen I and then left in an incubator for 2 h. Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, resuspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin serum-free medium, and then seeded in transwells (100,000 cells per transwell). Cells were allowed to grow on transwells for 72 h. Cells remaining inside the inserts were removed with cotton swabs, and the cells that had traversed to the reverse side of the inserts were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and stained with 1% crystal violet overnight at room temperature. Cells were counted under a light microscope (at 200× power), and invasive cell numbers were the averages of those from five areas on each insert. Each invasion assay was done in triplicate and repeated three times. Gelatin Zymography Assay—Cell cultures were seeded at a density of 150,000 cells in a 6-well dish in DMEM/F-12 media containing serum. The following day the cells were placed in serum-free media, and after 48 h the conditioned medium was collected and analyzed for proteinase activity. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Activity of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) was evaluated by gelatin zymography. Briefly, 15 μl of conditioned media or reaction mixture was mixed with 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agent. The conditioned media was loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1 mg/ml gelatin and run at 100 V for 4 h in non-reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton-X-100 twice for 15 min at room temperature. The gels were incubated at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2) for 24 h. Gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and destained in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Proteolytic activities of latent and activated gelatinase were visualized as clear bands against the blue background of stained gelatin. Statistical Analysis—Studentŉs t test for paired samples was used to determine statistical significance. Differences were considered statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05. Lymphotoxin-β Receptor Expression Is Up-regulated in Melanoma Cells—To examine the possibility that NF-κB activation in melanoma is linked to the expression of LTβ-R in melanoma cells, we looked for a correlation between of the LTβ-R and NF-κB activation. Four different melanoma cell lines and normal control NHEMs were studied. Cells were deprived of serum overnight, then expression of LTβ-R was assessed by immunoblotting cell lysates using LTβ-R-specific antibody (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the four melanoma cell lines, Hs294T, SKMel-5, WM115, and SKMel-28, exhibit high LTβ-R expression compared with NHEM cells. To further test whether the increase of LTβ-R expression is at the mRNA expression level, we used semiquantitative RT-PCR. Interestingly, in correlation with the protein levels based upon Western blot analysis, the RNA levels of LTβ-R were much higher in Hs294T and SKMel5 but moderate in WM115 and SKMel28 and not detected in NHEMs (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that melanoma cells have higher LTβ-R expression, which could potentially lead to activation of downstream pathways. Our prior studies have demonstrated that WM115, SKMel28, Hs294T, and SKMel5 cells exhibit moderate to high constitutive IKK activity compared with NHEM cells (22Yang J. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4901-4909PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the basal DNA binding activity of NF-κB as analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis is constitutively high in most of the melanoma cell lines (Hs294T, SKMel-5, WM115, and WM852) (20Dhawan P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) as compared with normal control cells. Thus, it appears that there is a correlation between the increased IKK activity, NF-κB binding activity, and LTβ-R expression in these four melanoma cell lines. To further extend our in vitro studies to human patient samples, we tested the expression of LTβ-R in 26 human patient samples, including normal nevi, compound nevi, intradermal nevi, dysplastic nevi, a severely dysplastic nevus, primary melanoma, and metastatic melanoma lesions (Table 1). The paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies of pigmented lesions were immunostained using a LTβ-R-specific antibody. Four levels of LTβ-R expression in tissue slides were documented based on the following criteria: score 0, no positive staining of any tumor cells on the slide; score 1, low positive staining on most of the tumor cells on the slide; score 2, moderate staining on most tumor cells; score 3, strong staining on most of the tumor cells on the slide. When there was heterogeneity on the staining intensity of different cell populations on the slide, the score in between the 0, 1, 2, or 3 reflects the average score across this population of cells. Each slide was evaluated independently by two researchers who were blinded to the pathology report. In agreement with our cell line data, the LTβ-R expression was much higher in metastatic melanoma tumor tissues (representative sample) (Fig. 2C) as compared with normal nevi or dysplastic nevi (Fig. 2, A and B). Fig. 2D represents a negative control, and confocal immunolocalization of the LTβ-R on tissue sections from metastatic melanoma is depicted in Fig. 2E.TABLE 1Immunostaining of normal and melanoma patients for LTβ-RPatient no.Histological diagnosisLTβ-R staining1Normal nevus12Normal nevus13Normal nevus24Normal nevus15Normal nevus1.756Normal nevus17Normal nevus2.58Normal nevus2.759Compound nevus1.510Compound nevus1.511Compound nevus212Intradermal nevus1.7513Intradermal nevus1.7514Dysplastic nevus215Dysplastic nevus2.516Severe dysplastic nevi1.7517Primary melanoma118Primary melanoma1.519Primary melanoma120Primary melanoma0.2521Primary melanoma1.2522Metastatic melanoma2.523Metastatic melanoma3.024Metastatic melanoma3.025Metastatic melanoma3.026Metastatic melanoma3.0 Open table in a new tab NF-κB Activity Is Induced on Activation of LTβ-R—We have previously demonstrated that NIK is involved in the up-regulation of constitutive IKK kinase activity in melanoma cells including Hs294T, SKMel5, and WM115 cell lines. In contrast, SKMel28 cells have lower constitutive IKK activity (22Yang J. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4901-4909PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether activation of LTβ-R signaling can induce NF-κB activity, we treated SKMel28 melanoma cells with LTβ-R agonist anti-body, and NF-κB promoter luciferase assays were performed. A significant increase in NF-κB luciferase activity was observed 24 h after treatment with agonist, thus demonstrating that LTβ-R can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway (likely through activation of NIK) in melanoma cells (Fig. 3A). LTβ-R NIK-NF-κB Pathway Induces Cell Proliferation—NF-κB has been linked to cellular transformation, proliferation, and apoptosis. To test whether this activated LTβ-R-NIK path-way is involved in functions of NF-κB in melanoma cells, we examined the effect of activation or inhibition of LTβ-R signaling pathway on cell proliferation. For these experiments we used Hs294T cells and treated them with the agonistic LTβ-R-specific monoclonal antibody (2 or 10 μg). Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT assay (Fig. 3B). We observed an increase in cell proliferation with the agonist antibody as compared with untreated Hs294T cells, confirming that the LTβ-R signaling pathway may be associated with enhanced viability/growth of human melanoma cells. Activation of the LTβ-R in Melanoma Appears to Be Ligand-independent—LIGHT as well as LTα1β2 are known ligands of LTβ-R. However, only LIGHT has been reported to be expressed by melanoma cells. To determine whether the melanoma cells studied here secrete LIGHT, we performed an ELISA assay for LIGHT in a number of melanoma cell lines. Even though LIGHT was detected in the conditioned medium of HEK293 cells stably transfected with LIGHT expression vector, we could not detect LIGHT protein in the culture medium, in cell lysates, or on the cell surface of melanoma cells by FACS (data not shown). Thus, it appears that LIGHT might not be the endogenous ligand that constitutively activates the LTβ-R and NIK in melanoma cells in culture. More-over, we were unable to detect LTβ expression by RT-PCR. We were also unable to detect LTα1/β2 by FACS analysis of the melanoma cells that exhibit the constitutive activation of NIK (data not shown). We further performed experiments to determine whether melanoma cells produce a ligand for the LTβ-R by treating cells with a soluble receptor chimera that has the ability to bind ligands for the LTβ-R and prevent their activation of the receptor (23Zhai Y. Guo R. Hsu T.L. Yu G.L. Ni J. Kwon B.S. Jiang G.W. Lu J. Tan J. Ugustus M. Carter K. Rojas L. Zhu R. Lincoln C. Endress G. Xing L. Wang S. Oh K.O. Gentz R. Ruben S. Lippman M.E. Hsieh S.L. Yang D. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and D). Our experiments showed that the chimera had no effect on the NF-κB luciferase activity or cell growth of Hs294T cells, arguing against auto-crine activation of the receptor through a secreted or membrane-bound ligand. Altogether, these data suggest that the level of expression of the receptor in Hs294T melanoma cells is sufficient to result in constitutive activation of the receptor down-stream signaling pathways.

Ca2+ signals are translated into physiological responses by EF-hand calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin (CaM). Multiple CaM isoforms occur in plant cells, whereas only a single CaM protein is found in animals. Soybean CaM isoform 1 (sCaM1) shares 90% amino acid sequence identity with animal CaM (aCaM), whereas sCaM4 is only 78% identical. These two sCaM isoforms have distinct target-enzyme activation properties and physiological functions. sCaM4 is highly expressed during the self-defense reaction of the plant and activates the enzyme nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), whereas sCaM1 is incapable of activating NOS. The mechanism of selective target activation by plant CaM isoforms is poorly understood. We have determined high resolution NMR solution structures of Ca2+-sCaM1 and -sCaM4. These were compared with previously determined Ca2+-aCaM structures. For the N-lobe of the protein, the solution structures of Ca2+-sCaM1, -sCaM4, and -aCaM all closely resemble each other. However, despite the high sequence identity with aCaM, the C-lobe of Ca2+-sCaM1 has a more open conformation and consequently a larger hydrophobic target-protein binding pocket than Ca2+-aCaM or -sCaM4, the presence of which was further confirmed through biophysical measurements. The single Val-144 → Met substitution in the C-lobe of Ca2+-sCaM1, which restores its ability to activate NOS, alters the structure of the C-lobe to a more closed conformation resembling Ca2+-aCaM and -sCaM4.

This small (∼17 kDa) acidic protein is found in all eukaryotic cells, and its amino acid sequence is strictly conserved. For example, the CaM sequence is invariant among the vertebrates (1Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 522-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CaM consists of two similar globular domains, the N-lobe and C-lobe, which are connected by a highly mobile central linker region (2Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 3Tjandra N. Kuboniwa H. Ren H. Bax A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Each lobe possesses two helix-loop-helix EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs (4Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 5Kretsinger R.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Gifford J.L. Walsh M.P. Vogel H.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, CaM adopts a “closed” conformation, where the four α-helices in each lobe are well packed in an almost parallel orientation. Upon binding Ca2+, CaM undergoes a large rearrangement of its helices altering the domain structure to the “open” conformation, whereby the hydrophobic methionine-rich interiors of each lobe become partially exposed to the solvent (7Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). The exposed hydrophobic pockets commonly serve as the primary binding interfaces for the CaM-binding domains (CaMBDs) of various CaM-target proteins mainly through hydrophobic interactions (reviewed in Refs. 8Hoeflich K.P.

Biol. 2000; 301: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) in terms of the arrangement of the α-helices, which creates a difference in the size of the hydrophobic target-binding pocket. In contrast to the extensive knowledge about the structural and biological properties of CaM in vertebrates and other animals (aCaM), relatively little is known about the CaM regulatory system in higher plant species. The Ca2+ level in plant cells changes through various extracellular stimuli such as light, cold/heat shock, touch, osmotic stress, wounding, hormones, and the presence of pathogens (15Lecourieux D. Raneva R. Pugin A. New Phytol. 2006; 171: 249-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). These Ca2+ signals are absorbed by multiple CaM isoforms in contrast to the single CaM protein found in animals (16Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). For instance, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has nine CaM genes (CaM1–9) encoding seven different CaM isoforms (16Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 17Zielinski R.E. Planta. 2002; 214: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Soybean has five distinct CaM genes (sCaM1–5) encoding four distinct isoforms of CaM (18Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Bahk J.D. Hwang I. Cho M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21806-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the latter organism, sCaM1, -2, and -3 are highly homologous to aCaM with >90% sequence identity, whereas sCaM4 and -5 are divergent with only ∼78% sequence identity. These sCaM isoforms show unique target activation profiles that have been categorized into three different groups (19Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Heo W.D. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Cheong Y.H.

The target enzymes belonging to group 1 include for example, myosin light chain kinases (MLCKs), and they are activated in a similar manner by both sCaM1 and -4. In contrast, group 2 and 3 target enzymes are exclusively activated by sCaM1 or sCaM4, respectively. It seems therefore that each CaM isoform is utilized to control enzymes involved in specific physiological responses in plants. For example, expression of the two most divergent isoforms, sCaM4 and -5, is markedly induced by treatment with a fungal elicitor or following a pathogen attack, and they both can activate the group 3 enzyme nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) (21Heo W.D. Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Chun H.J. Lee K.J. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Choi J.Y. Cho M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Generation of nitric oxide is thought to be one of the early events in plant defense reactions (22Klessig D.F. Durner J. Noad R. Navarre D.A. Wendehenne D. Kumar D. Zhou J.M. Shah J. Zhang S.

Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even though all sCaM isoforms retain the ability to bind strongly to enzymes belonging to the other group(s), they cannot properly activate them, which raises a question about how they distinguish their own target enzymes for activation rather than acting as a competitive inhibitor (19Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Heo W.D. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Cheong Y.H. Kim C.Y. Lee K.J. Bahk J.D. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies of aCaM and sCaM isoforms have identified some of the residues that are responsible for the target selectivity. For example, the substitution of Lys-30 and Gly-40 in sCaM1 by Glu-30 and Asp-40 in sCaM4 are the main reason that sCaM4 fails to activate NAD kinase and smooth muscle MLCK (24Lee S.H. Seo H.Y.

These two residues are located on a hydrophilic surface that is opposite to the exposed hydrophobic patch; as such these interactions are not seen in studies with typical CaMBD target peptides. On the other hand, the Met-144 → Val substitution within the C-lobe hydrophobic patch seems to be the main reason that sCaM1 fails to activate NOS (26Kondo R. Tikunova S.B. Cho M.J. Johnson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36213-36218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently the target-binding properties of these sCaM isoforms have been tested using spectroscopic and calorimetric studies (27Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7698-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the detailed three-dimensional structures of the sCaM isoforms and the structural features that contribute to their different enzyme activation properties have not been analyzed to date. Here we describe the solution structures of Ca2+-sCaM1 and Ca2+-sCaM4, the soybean CaM isoforms, that are the most closely related and the most divergent from aCaM, respectively. The solution structures of these CaM isoforms have unexpectedly revealed that the C-lobe of Ca2+-sCaM1 has a more open conformation relative to those of Ca2+-sCaM4 and Ca2+-aCaM. Additional biophysical experiments further confirm the presence of an enlarged exposed hydrophobic pocket in Ca2+-sCaM1. Interestingly, the single Val-144 → Met substitution was found to reduce the size of this hydrophobic pocket of the C-lobe in Ca2+-sCaM1, which in turn restores its ability to activate NOS. Taken together our data provide unique insights into the relationship between the structural differences and the selective target activation properties of plant sCaM isoforms. Sample Preparation—The Val-144 → Met mutant of sCaM1 (S1V144M) was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. Unlabeled sCaM1, sCaM4, and S1V144M were overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli, strain BL21(DE3), containing the plasmid pET-3d as the expression vector, grown in LB media. Uniformly 15N- and 15N,13C-labeled sCaM1, sCaM4, and S1V144M were prepared in M9 media containing 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl and/or 3 g/liter 13C6-glucose. All proteins were purified as described previously (18Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Bahk J.D. Hwang I. Cho M.J. J. Biol.

All NMR samples contained ∼1 mm 15N- or 15N,13C-labeled sCaM1 or sCaM4, 6 mm CaCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.03% NaN3, and 0.5 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane 5-sulfonate in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 99.99% D2O (pH 6.8). In addition, 10 mm 2H-labeled dithiothreitol was also added to avoid dimerization caused by intermolecular disulfide bonding. Unlabeled sCaM1 and sCaM4 samples were also prepared in 99.99% D2O. The samples used for residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements also contained 20 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.8) and 16 mg/ml filamentous phage Pf1 (Asla Labs). The samples used for the chemical shift perturbation (CSP) studies using 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) also contained an additional 20 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.8). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Steady-state ANS fluorescence was recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Victoria, Australia), with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm, and the fluorescence emission was recorded from 400 to 600 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were 2.5 nm and 5 nm, respectively, and a volume of 1 ml was used. The samples contained 60 μm ANS and 20 μm sCaM1, sCaM4, aCaM, or S1V144M in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA for the apo-form or 1 mm CaCl2 for the Ca2+ form. The concentrations of sCaM4 and aCaM were measured using a molar extinction coefficient of 2560 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. The concentration of sCaM1 and S1V144M was measured by using a molar extinction coefficient of 1450 m−1 cm−1 at 280 and by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Experiments—The ANS-CaM interactions were monitored by ITC at 20, 25, and 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and either 5 mm CaCl2 or 3 mm EDTA/EGTA. 5 mm ANS was titrated into a sample cell containing 50–70 μm protein. sCaM1, sCaM4, and S1V144M were incubated overnight at room temperature in the buffer containing an additional 5 mm dithiothreitol and then desalted into the buffer without dithiothreitol using Bio-Rad Econo-Pac 10DG column before the ITC experiments. All data were analyzed using the “one set of sites” model supplied in the MicroCal Origin software to determine association constant (Ka) as described in studies of methionine-modified CaMs (29Yuan T. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 5Yamniuk, A. P., Ishida, H., Lippert, D., and Vogel, H. J., submitted for publication. NMR Measurements—All NMR experiments for structure determination were performed at 30 °C on Bruker Avance 500- or 700-MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with triple resonance inverse Cryoprobes with a single axis z-gradient. Sequential assignments of HN, N, CO, Cα, and Cβ resonances of sCaMs were achieved using two dimensional (1H,15N)-HSQC (HSQC) and three-dimensional experiments, including CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA. Side-chain assignments were obtained by three-dimensional C(CCO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, HBHA (CBCACO)NH, (HB)CB(CGCD)HD (30Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE (30Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar) experiments. All NOESY experiments including the three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional 13C-NOESY-HSQC and two-dimensional NOESY were measured with a mixing time of 100 ms. H-N RDC measurements were performed using the in-phase/anti-phase (1H, 15N)-HSQC experiment (31Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). {1H}-15N NOE experiments were acquired on 700- and 500-MHz for sCaM1 and sCaM4, respectively, using a recycle delay of 5 s (32Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar), and each experiment was repeated three times. Chemical shifts in all spectra were referenced using 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane 5-sulfonate to obtain the 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts as described by Wishart et al. (33Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed using the program NMRPipe (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11620) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the NMRView software (35Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Initial structures were calculated with CYANA (36Jee J. Guntert P. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) version 2.0 using distance restraints obtained from the automatic NOE assignment protocol, hydrogen bond restraints based on secondary structure from the chemical shift index, and dihedral angle restraints predicted by TALOS (37Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Further structural refinements with the addition of RDC restraints were performed by XPLOR-NIH (38Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Initial estimations for the axial component of the molecular alignment tensor (Da) and the rhombicity (R) were obtained for the structure calculated by CYANA using PALES (39Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures from a total of 200 calculated were selected and analyzed. All molecular graphics are created using MOL-MOL (40Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6496) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Ca2+-sCaM1 and Ca2+-sCaM4 both generated well dispersed high quality 1H,15N-HSQC spectra (Fig. 2). Sequential assignments of the main-chain resonances were obtained from the HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO experiments. Consequently, all amide resonances except for one Pro and a few of the N-terminal residues were successfully assigned in the 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum of both Ca2+-sCaM1 and Ca2+-sCaM4 (Fig. 2). The side-chain resonance assignments were mainly obtained from the C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, and HBHA(CO)NH spectra. The (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE experiments were also used for the assignment of aromatic 1H resonances. Consequently, 96.4% and 98.5% of the total 1H resonances are assigned and used for the structure calculations of Ca2+-sCaM1 and Ca2+-sCaM4, respectively. The NOE signals used to generate distance restraints were collected from the three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-NOESY-HSQC experiments as well as the two-dimensional-NOESY experiment recorded in D2O solution. Initially, a total of 3408 and 2808 NOE signals were manually identified, and 3008 and 2727 signals were successfully assigned by CYANA 2.0 with an automatic NOE assignment protocol, which generated 2019 and 1942 distance restraints for Ca2+-sCaM1 and Ca2+-sCaM4, respectively. The calculated structures together with hydrogen-bond restraints, standard Ca2+-ligand distances, and the TALOS dihedral angles for both sCaM1 and sCaM4 quite closely resembled the previously determined structures for Ca2+-aCaM, where the N- and C-lobe of the protein are tethered by a short disordered linker region (residues 77–79), and no NOE restraints were found between the two lobes of the protein. {1H}-15N-NOE experiments for both sCaM1 and sCaM4 show small heteronuclear NOE values (∼0.4) in their central linker regions, suggesting that this part of each protein is highly flexible in contrast to the N- and C-lobes themselves, which have NOE values typical for folded globular domains (∼0.7) (Fig. 3). Therefore, in the later stages of structure refinement, the structures were separately refined against the N-lobe (residues 1–79) and C-lobe (residues 80–148/149) of the sCaMs using the program XPLOR-NIH, with the addition of H-N RDC restraints. The RDC values for sCaM1 ranged between -24 and 21 Hz with a digital resolution of 2.5 Hz. The complete set of RDC values determined for sCaM4 ranged from -16 to 16 Hz with a digital resolution of 1.7 Hz. All of the restraints used for the final structure calculations of the four structures are summarized in Table 1. The backbone r.m.s.d. values of the final 20 structures of sCaM1 were 0.47 ± 0.06 Å and 0.32 ± 0.06 Å for the N-lobe (residues 5–76) and C-lobe (residues 81–147), respectively. Those for sCaM4 in the corresponding regions are 0.44 ± 0.07 Å and 0.36 ± 0.06 Å, respectively. The experimentally determined RDC values provide an excellent correlation with the best-fit RDC values calculated with the final structures of sCaM1 and sCaM4. The correlation (R)/quality (Q) factors of sCaM1 were 1.00/0.007 and 1.00/0.011 for the N- and C-lobe, respectively. These values for sCaM4 were 1.00/0.026 and 1.00/0.018 for the N- and C-lobe, respectively.FIGURE 3{1H}-15N NOE data for sCaM1 (a) and sCaM4 (b).

These structures are as expected, based on sequence homology, very similar to one another. The backbone r.m.s.d. values in the helical regions are 0.88 Å and 1.50 Å for the N- and C-lobe, respectively. Consistent with this, the R/Q factors from the correlations between experimentally measured 1H-15N RDC values of Ca2+-sCaM1 and the best-fit RDC values calculated with sCaM4 structures were 0.99/0.163 and 0.88/0.477 for the N- and C-lobe, respectively. The disagreement in the C-lobes seems to be mainly caused by a difference in the location of the H-helices (Fig. 4b). The structures were also compared with an available high resolution (1 Å) crystal structure (PDB entry 1EXR (14Wilson M.A. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)) and to NMR structures (PDB entries 1J7O and 1J7P (12Chou J.J. Li S. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)) of aCaM. The correlations of the RDC values that were measured for sCaM1 and sCaM4 to these aCaM structures and the resulting backbone r.m.s.d. values are summarized in Table 2. The N-lobes of both sCaM1 and sCaM4 show better agreement with the N-lobe solution structure of aCaM determined by NMR than with the high resolution crystal structure, as determined by examining both the RDC correlations and the backbone r.m.s.d values. In Fig. 5a, all N-lobe structures of CaM isoforms are overlaid on their A- and D-helices, so that the differences in the positions of the B- and C-helices are emphasized. As has been discussed, the crystal structure of Ca2+-aCaM differs from the Ca2+-aCaM structures determined by NMR in terms of the arrangement of helices (12Chou J.J. Li S. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), where the solution NMR structure adopts a more “closed” conformation. Similar closed conformations are found in our N-lobe structures of both Ca2+-sCaM1 and Ca2+-sCaM4. The differences in the helix angles among all three NMR structures are small, <6° for both the B- and C-helix (Fig. 5a and Table 3). The C-lobes however seem to have a larger variability in the arrangements of its helices among the various CaM structures (Fig. 5b). Similar to the N-lobe, the C-lobe of Ca2+-aCaM adopts a more closed conformation in the NMR structure than what is seen in the crystal structure. In Fig. 5b, when the E- and H-helices are overlaid, the difference in the helix angles between Ca2+-sCaM4 and Ca2+-aCaM are relatively small, 4.6° and 11.4° for the F- and G-helix, respectively. However, those differences between Ca2+-sCaM4 and Ca2+-sCaM1 are more obvious, 19.5° and 16.0° for the F- and G-helix, respectively. Backbone r.m.s.d. values also show that the C-lobe of Ca2+-sCaM4 is relatively similar to that of the NMR-determined Ca2+-aCaM structure. On the other hand, the C-lobe of Ca2+-sCaM1 is more closely related to the crystal structure of Ca2+-aCaM (Table 2). The backbone r.m.s.d. values in the latter case are 1.14 and 0.90 Å to the NMR and the crystal structure, respectively. Based on these observations, it seems that the C-lobe of sCaM1 adopts a more open conformation in solution and has a larger hydrophobic target binding pocket than either Ca2+-sCaM4 or Ca2+-aCaM.TABLE 2Correlations between experimentally measured 1H-15N RDC values of sCaM isoforms and best-fit RDC values calculated with the CaM structures Backbone r.m.s.d. values are also shown in the table. All values were calculated using helix regions: A, 10–19; B, 29–39; C, 45–53; D, 65–76; E, 85–92; F, 102–112; G, 118–128; and H-helix, 138–146.

https://openalex.org/W2059843694,"In this study, we tested the hypothesis that human neutrophil alpha-defensins (HNPs) inhibit hepatic glucose production through a signaling pathway distinct from insulin. The effect of HNP-1 on fasting blood glucose levels and the expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes was first examined. Using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, we determined the effect of HNP-1 on endogenous glucose production, hepatic expression of key gluconeogenic genes and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. In isolated primary hepatocytes, we studied the effect of HNP-1 and -2 on glucose production, expression of gluconeogenic genes, and phosphorylation of Akt, c-Src, and FoxO1. Our results show that HNP-1 reduced blood glucose levels of both normal mice and Zucker diabetic fatty rats predominantly through suppression of hepatic glucose production. HNPs inhibited glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes. HNPs also suppressed expression of key gluconeogenic genes including phosphoenoylpyruvate carboxyl kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase. To investigate the mechanism, we found that HNPs stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 without activating IRS1. Nevertheless, HNPs activated c-Src. Blockade of c-Src activity with either a chemical inhibitor PP2 or an alternative inhibitor CSK prevented the inhibitory effect of HNPs on gluconeogenesis. Together, our results support the hypothesis that HNPs can suppress hepatic glucose production through an intracellular mechanism distinct from the classical insulin signaling pathway."
