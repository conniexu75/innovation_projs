https://openalex.org/W2087559453,"Radioactive carbon determinations of the age of peat indicate that at Bermuda, southern Florida, North Carolina, and Louisiana the relative sea level has risen at approximately the same rate, 2.5 x 10(-3) foot per year (0.76 x 10(-3) meter per year), during the past 4000 years. It is proposed tentatively that this is the rate of eustatic change in sea level. The rise in sea level along the northeastern coast of the United States has been at a rate much greater than this, indicating local subsidence of the land. Between Cape Cod and northern Virginia, coastal subsidence of 13 feet appears to have occurred between 4000 and 2000 years ago and has continued at a rate of about 1 x 10(-3) foot per year since then. On the northeastern coast of Massachusetts, subsidence of 6 feet occurred between 4000 and 3000 years ago; since then sea level has risen at about the eustatic rate. Between 12,000 and 4000 years ago, sea level rose at an average of about 11 x 10(-3) foot per year. The part played by local subsidence or temporary departures from the average rate during this period is uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1966448397,"Relative sea levels for early post-Pleistocene time are best known from radiocarbon dates of sediments on the continental shelves off Texas and off northeastern United States. Differences in indicated rates of the rise of relative sea level and in depths of the shelf-breaks reveal differential vertical movement of the two shelves during this time, with the result that the Atlantic shelf has sunk with respect to the Texas shelf."

 that man will soon have the power to shape his own biological destiny. He fears that man may be able to program
 his own cells before assessing the consequences and insists that we must refrain from instructing our own cells until we are
 wise enough to make a decision as an informed society."
https://openalex.org/W2004472784,"An upper limit of 0.02 second of arc has been determined for a hydroxyl radical (OH) emission region associated with the radio source W3, with the use of a Michelson interferometer consisting of two radio telescopes 845 kilometers apart. Timing was provided at the stations by independent atomic frequency standards. The 1665-megahertz radiation was translated to video frequency and recorded digitally on magnetic tapes which were later processed by computer, yielding fringe phase and amplitude as a function of frequency over the received bandwidth."

https://openalex.org/W2004148075,"The outer reef on the explored southeast margin of the Bermuda platform is a submerged dune ridge thinly veneered with encrusting organisms. Aeolianites were deposited on what appears to be an older truncated surface, the reef-front terrace, now submerged to a depth of about 18 meters. Underwater examination reveals relict features of probable solutional origin that honeycomb the aeolinite and that have undergone only minor modification by erosion since the last eustatic rise of the sea. Submarine planation, even in this marginal area of reef growth, is a relatively slow process."

Varying diabetogenic effects were obtained with highly purified prolactin preparations, with progesterone, with testosterone and with a fraction, probably also protein, from the anterior pituitary."

https://openalex.org/W2024093515,"Surveyor I landed on the lunar surface on 2 June 1966 and obtained more than 11,000 pictures of the environment with its television camera. The same region was photographed by the 24-inch (61-centimeter) camera of Orbiter III on 22 February 1967. Surveyor I has been located in these Orbiter photographs; its image was found and all search and identification criteria were satisfied by the site."
