https://openalex.org/W2022587035,"Although DNA methylation has been actively studied for several decades, the mechanism by which it causes gene silencing remains largely unknown. In contrast to DNA methylation, the histone variant H2A.Z promotes transcriptional competence in plants, animals and fungi. This paper reports the finding that regions of DNA methylation in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome are deficient in H2A.Z. DNA methylation appears to repress transcription by exclusion of H2A.Z. This suggets a novel relationship between a covalent modification of DNA and a core nucleosome component with an important role in organizing eukaryotic chromatin. Eukaryotic chromatin is separated into functional domains differentiated by post-translational histone modifications, histone variants and DNA methylation1,2,3,4,5,6. Methylation is associated with repression of transcriptional initiation in plants and animals, and is frequently found in transposable elements. Proper methylation patterns are crucial for eukaryotic development4,5, and aberrant methylation-induced silencing of tumour suppressor genes is a common feature of human cancer7. In contrast to methylation, the histone variant H2A.Z is preferentially deposited by the Swr1 ATPase complex near 5′ ends of genes where it promotes transcriptional competence8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. How DNA methylation and H2A.Z influence transcription remains largely unknown. Here we show that in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana regions of DNA methylation are quantitatively deficient in H2A.Z. Exclusion of H2A.Z is seen at sites of DNA methylation in the bodies of actively transcribed genes and in methylated transposons. Mutation of the MET1 DNA methyltransferase, which causes both losses and gains of DNA methylation4,5, engenders opposite changes (gains and losses) in H2A.Z deposition, whereas mutation of the PIE1 subunit of the Swr1 complex that deposits H2A.Z17 leads to genome-wide hypermethylation. Our findings indicate that DNA methylation can influence chromatin structure and effect gene silencing by excluding H2A.Z, and that H2A.Z protects genes from DNA methylation."

Several recent studies have identified signalling networks within neurons that control excitatory synapse development. However, less is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity-dependent development of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing inhibitory synapses. Here we report the identification of a transcription factor, Npas4, that plays a role in the development of inhibitory synapses by regulating the expression of activity-dependent genes, which in turn control the number of GABA-releasing synapses that form on excitatory neurons. These findings demonstrate that the activity-dependent gene program regulates inhibitory synapse development, and suggest a new role for this program in controlling the homeostatic balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1971042231,"As a key component of the innate immunity system, human cathelicidin LL-37 plays an essential role in protecting humans against infectious diseases. To elucidate the structural basis for its targeting bacterial membrane, we have determined the high quality structure of 13C,15N-labeled LL-37 by three-dimensional triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy, because two-dimensional 1H NMR did not provide sufficient spectral resolution. The structure of LL-37 in SDS micelles is composed of a curved amphipathic helix-bend-helix motif spanning residues 2–31 followed by a disordered C-terminal tail. The helical bend is located between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16. Similar chemical shifts and 15N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns of the peptide in complex with dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol (D8PG) micelles indicate a similar structure. The aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37, as well as arginines, showed intermolecular NOE cross-peaks with D8PG, providing direct evidence for the association of the entire amphipathic helix with anionic lipid micelles. The structure of LL-37 serves as a model for understanding the structure and function relationship of homologous primate cathelicidins. Using synthetic peptides, we also identified the smallest antibacterial peptide KR-12 corresponding to residues 18–29 of LL-37. Importantly, KR-12 displayed a selective toxic effect on bacteria but not human cells. NMR structural analysis revealed a short three-turn amphipathic helix rich in positively charged side chains, allowing for effective competition for anionic phosphatidylglycerols in bacterial membranes. KR-12 may be a useful peptide template for developing novel antimicrobial agents of therapeutic use.

KR-12 may be a useful peptide template for developing novel antimicrobial agents of therapeutic use. The growing drug resistance problem of pathogenic bacteria with traditional antibiotics calls for an urgent search for a new generation of antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial peptides are ancient and potent weapons of the innate immunity of all life forms (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 2Sambhara S. Lehrer R.I. Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2007; 5: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 3Hancock R.E.W.

The recently updated Antimicrobial Peptide Data base collects more than 1228 such peptides (5Wang Z. Wang G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D590-D592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, defensins and cathelicidins are the two major families of antimicrobial peptides. While several cathelicidins were found in animals such as sheep, cow, and pig, only one cathelicidin was identified in humans (6Zanetti M. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2005; 7: 179-196PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor proteins of the cathelicidin family share a highly conserved N-terminal “cathelin” domain, but have a highly variable C-terminal antimicrobial region. Upon bacterial insult, human cathelicidin LL-37 (named based on the first two amino acids in the sequence followed by the number of residues in the peptide) is released by proteases from its precursor hCAP-18 (i.e. human cationic antimicrobial protein, ∼18 kDa). The importance of this host defense peptide to human health is now firmly established. Patients lacking this molecule are more susceptible to infections (7Pütsep K. Carlsson G. Boman H.G. Andersson M. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1144-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). While cathelicidin knock-out mice are more readily infected (8Nizet V. Ohtake T. Lauth X. Trowbridge J. Rudisill J. Dorschner R.A. Pestonjamasp V. Piraino J. Huttner K. Gallo R.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), expression of additional cathelicidins protects the animals from infection (9Lee P.H. Ohtake T. Zaiou M. Murakami M. Rudisill J.A. Lin K.H. Gallo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). LL-37 also associates with lipopolysaccharides (or endotoxin) and protects rats from sepsis caused by bacteria (10Cirioni O. Giacometti A. Ghiselli R. Bergnach C. Orlando F. Silvestri C. Mocchegiani F. Licci A. Skerlavaj B. Rocchi M. Saba V. Zanetti M. Scalise G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1672-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). LL-37 is also reduced in cystic fibrosis airways as a result of direct interaction with DNA and filamentous F-actin (11Bucki R. Byfield F.J. Janmey P.A. Eur. Respir. J. 2007; 29: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As a consequence, there is a high interest in developing novel peptides of therapeutic value based on LL-37. To provide insight into the mechanism of action of LL-37, biochemical and biophysical studies lent support to the membrane targeting of the peptide. Oren et al. (12Oren Z. Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) found that LL-37 self-associated when bound to zwitterionic lipids, but dissociated into monomers in the presence of negatively charged vesicles. CD studies indicated a helical conformation of LL-37 upon binding to membrane-mimetic models (13Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Solid-state NMR studies indicated that LL-37 is located on the surface of lipid bilayers (14Henzler-Wildman K.A. Lee D.K. Ramamoorthy A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6545-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Using the monolayer of phospholipids, LL-37 was demonstrated to have preferential interactions with anionic phosphatidylglycerols (PGs) 2The abbreviations used are: PG, phosphatidylglycerol; D8PG, dioctanoylphosphatidylglycerol; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectroscopy; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. (15Neville F. Cahuzac M. Konovalov O. Ishitsuka Y. Lee K.Y.C. Kuzmenko I. Kale G.M. Gidalevitz D. Biophy. J. 2006; 90: 1275-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This lipid selection is essential for selective targeting of anionic bacterial membranes by cationic antimicrobial peptides. The three-dimensional structure of intact LL-37 in complex with bacterial membranes would be invaluable to understanding the mechanism of action, but was not available prior to our study. Although homonuclear two-dimensional NMR techniques set the record of structural determination of micelle-bound peptides and proteins up to ∼50 residues (16Wang G. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we met difficulty in structural studies of this 37-residue membrane peptide in complex with SDS micelles due to heavy spectral overlap (Fig. 1A). Thus, it is necessary to utilize three-dimensional NMR techniques. For this purpose, isotope-labeled polypeptides are required. Direct expression of LL-37 in yeast gave a very low level of the peptide (17Hong I.P. Lee S.J. Kim Y.S. Choi S.G. Biotechnol. Lett. 2007; 29: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using bacterial expression systems, we obtained 1.7 mg of recombinant LL-37 from one liter of culture (18Li Y. Li X. Wang G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas Moon et al. (19Moon J.Y. Henzler-Wildman K.A. Ramamoorthy A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported 0.3 mg. Subsequent studies revealed that the LL-37-containing fusion protein was essentially uncleaved by thrombin at a site adjacent to LL-37 (probably due to peptide aggregation), but could be readily digested by formic acid. Our continued improvements not only simplified the purification protocol for LL-37 but also improved the peptide yield (reviewed in Ref. 16Wang G. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), opening the door to structure and dynamics studies of LL-37 by three-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. As a consequence of formic acid cleavage at the Asp-Pro site, recombinant LL-37 obtained in this manner retained an extra proline residue at the N terminus. We demonstrated that the recombinant LL-37 we obtained had an identical antibacterial activity to the synthetic peptide corresponding to the native sequence (18Li Y. Li X. Wang G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, this form of recombinant LL-37 is useful for structural analysis. Because of the complex nature of bacterial membranes, structural studies of membrane-associated peptides and proteins by solution NMR are usually performed in membrane-mimetic micelles (16Wang G. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This is because the faster the tumbling of the peptide/lipid complex, the narrower the spectral linewidth. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of recombinant LL-37 in SDS micelles. To provide additional insight into the interactions of human cathelicidin with anionic PGs, we also conducted the study in the presence of D8PG, a new bacterial membrane model for solution NMR (16Wang G. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides, we also report the identification and structural studies of the shortest antimicrobial peptide, KR-12, corresponding to residues 18–29 of LL-37. Selective toxicity of KR-12 makes it a promising candidate for developing novel and potent antimicrobial agents. NMR Spectroscopy—15N- or 15N,13C-labeled recombinant LL-37 was expressed and purified using the established protocol (20Li Y. Li X. Wang G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 54: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The LL-37/SDS complex contains ∼0.5 mm peptide and 80-fold of deuterated SDS (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). A complex was also made between 15N- or 15N,13C-labeled LL-37 (∼0.5 mm) and protonated D8PG (> 98%, Avanti lipids, AL) at a molar ratio of 1:30. To facilitate peptide-lipid NOE observations, 2 mm synthetic LL-37 (>95% purity, Genemed Synthesis, TX) was co-solubilized with 10 mm D8PG. A similar sample was made for KR-12 in D8PG. The pH of all NMR samples, containing 10% D2O, was measured directly in the NMR tubes using a micro-pH electrode (Wilmad-Labglass). NMR data were recorded on a Varian INOVA 600-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryogenic probe with a z-axis gradient capability. In two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra, the spectral width in both dimensions was 8510.6 Hz. In the case of two-dimensional HSQC spectra, the sweep width for the 15N dimension was typically set to 2200 Hz with 100 increments. For natural abundance HSQC, 30 increments were collected in the 15N dimension with 256 scans each. For temperature coefficient measurements, HSQC spectra of LL-37 were recorded at every 5 degrees from 15 to 30 °C. The temperature coefficient (in ppm × 10-3/°C) for each backbone amide proton was calculated by linear regression of chemical shifts versus temperature. Residue-specific 15N{1H} NOE values for 15N-labeled LL-37 in SDS or D8PG micelles were measured using two-dimensional (1H,15N) correlated spectroscopy with and without proton saturation as described (21Li X. Peterkofsky A. Wang G. Amino Acids. 2008; 35: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For signal assignments, several double- and triple-resonance NMR experiments, including HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, HNHA, HBHA(CO)NH, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY (22Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar), were performed using 13C,15N-labeled LL-37 as detailed previously (23Li X. Peterkofsky A. Wang G. J. Biomol NMR. 2003; 27: 401-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Typically, these three-dimensional experiments were recorded with sweep widths/increments of 1,000 Hz/28 for 15N, 12067.8 Hz/60 for aliphatic 13C, and 3770 Hz/40 for carbonyl carbon in the indirect dimensions, and with a spectral width of 8510.6 Hz and 1024 complex points in the 1H-detected dimension, respectively. The carriers for 1H, 15N, and 13C were positioned at 4.67, 118.2, and 47.3 ppm, respectively. Chemical shifts were referenced as described (23Li X. Peterkofsky A. Wang G. J. Biomol NMR. 2003; 27: 401-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Data were processed on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station using NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed by PIPP (25Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—For structural calculations of SDS-bound LL-37, the major restraints were derived from three-dimensional NOESY spectra (26Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). For D8PG-bound KR-12, distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional NOESY spectra. The cross peaks were integrated by PIPP (25Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and converted to distance restraints 1.8–2.8, 1.8–3.8, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak types of NOE peaks, respectively. Based on 1Hα, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13C carbonyl chemical shifts, backbone angles of micelle-bound LL-37 were predicted by using an updated version of TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints for the structured region were derived from temperature coefficients as described (21Li X. Peterkofsky A. Wang G. Amino Acids. 2008; 35: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For KR-12 in D8PG micelles, backbone angles were predicted based on 1Hα and natural abundance 15N chemical shifts (16Wang G. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An extended covalent structure was used as starting coordinates. An ensemble of structures was calculated by using the simulated annealing protocol in the Xplor-NIH program (28Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Structures were accepted based on the following criteria: no NOE-derived distance violations greater than 0.20 Å, back dihedral angle violations less than 2°, r.m.s.d. for bond deviations from ideality less than 0.01 Å, and r.m.s.d. for angle deviations from ideality less than 5°. The structures were viewed and analyzed using PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Solution Structure of Human LL-37 in Complex with SDS Micelles—The 1H signals of LL-37 in SDS are poorly dispersed in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum (Fig. 1A), but are well separated in different two-dimensional planes of the three-dimensional NOESY spectrum (Fig. 1B). Sequential 1H, 13C, and 15N signal assignments were then achieved by using triple-resonance NMR experiments (22Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar) using isotope-labeled samples (23Li X. Peterkofsky A. Wang G. J. Biomol NMR. 2003; 27: 401-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) analysis of 1Hα, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13C carbonyl chemical shifts of micelle-bound LL-37 identified a helical region covering residues 2–30. No consensus angles were predicted for residues 31–36. The three-dimensional structure of LL-37 in complex with SDS was determined based on the following NMR restraints: 345 NOE-derived distance restraints, 58 chemical shift-derived backbone angle restraints, and 19 temperature coefficient-derived hydrogen-bond restraints (Table 1). Fig. 2A presents an ensemble of 28 structures of LL-37 accepted based on the criteria defined under “Experimental Procedures.” The r.m.s.d. is 0.69 Å when the backbone atoms of residues 2–30 are superimposed. According to PROCHECK analysis (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) of the ensemble of structures deposited into the Protein Data Bank, 93.8% of the residues are located in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and 6.2% are located in the additionally allowed region, indicating high quality. A ribbon diagram of the structure (Fig. 2B) is generated using MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of LL-37 consists of a well-defined long helix covering residues 2–31 with the remaining C-terminal residues disordered. The overall structural pattern of LL-37 in SDS micelles agrees well with both heteronuclear NOE measurements (Fig. 3A) and the secondary chemical shift plot (Fig. 3B). The former indicates that residues 2–32 are ordered and the C terminus is mobile, while the latter indicates a helical region covering residues 2–31 of LL-37. A further examination found that the amphipathic helix is curved with a bend between residues Gly-14 and Glu-16 (Fig. 2, B and C). Residues 14–16 as the bend are consistent with the 1Hα secondary chemical shift plot (Fig. 3B), where residues 14 and 16 showed near zero or positive deviations. We propose that the hydrophobic packing between residues Ile-13 and Phe-17 plays an important role in causing the helical bend in the structure of LL-37. Aligned on the concave surface is a train of hydrophobic side chains: Leu-2, Phe-5, Phe-6, Leu-13, Phe-17, Ile-20, Val-21, Ile-24, Phe-27, Leu-28, and Leu-31. Note that a hydrophilic residue Ser-9 is also located on the hydrophobic surface (Fig. 2B), leading to a division of the hydrophobic surface into two regions. The aromatic-aromatic stacking between Phe-5 and Phe-6 (Fig. 2B), also observed in the structure of the N-terminal fragment of LL-37 (31Li X. Li Y. Han H. Miller D.W. Wang G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 5776-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), may be responsible for the upfield shift of the Hδ protons of Phe-5 at 6.92 ppm.TABLE 1Structural statistics of human LL-37 and KR-12 bound to micellesStructural restraintsLL-37 in SDSKR-12 in D8PGNOE restraints (total)34586Intra-residue12417Sequential12837Short range9432Backbone angles (ϕ/ψ)aPredicted by the updated version of the TALOS program (27)5820Hydrogen bonds19Structural qualityBackbone r.m.s.d.

NMR. 2004; 29: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) revealed that the τc of the LL-37/D8PG complex at 50 °C was 6.9 ns (similar to 7.0 ns for an 18-kDa globular protein IIAGlc in solution at 35 °C), while the τc values in SDS are 7.0, 6.83, and 6.36 ns at 25, 35, and 45 °C, respectively. Clearly, the NMR-derived correlation time of LL-37 in D8PG at 50 °C is comparable to that in SDS at ∼30 °C, indicating that the LL-37/SDS complex tumbles faster than the LL-37/D8PG complex in aqueous solution at the same temperature. Based on the chemical shift assignments of LL-37 in D8PG, we have also obtained the 1Hα secondary shifts (i.e. the measured shifts minus the random-coiled shifts). The plots of LL-37 obtained in SDS (Fig. 3B) and in D8PG (Fig. 3C) are remarkably similar, indicating a helical structure from residues 2 to 31 in both systems. Furthermore, TALOS analysis of 1Hα, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13C carbonyl chemical shifts of LL-37 in D8PG led to the definition of the helical region covering residues 2–30, i.e. also identical to that found in SDS. At 50 °C, the overall trend of heteronuclear NOE values of human cathelicidin in D8PG (not shown) is also similar to that in SDS (Fig. 3A). We conclude that the structures of LL-37 in SDS and D8PG micelles are very similar if not identical. The introduction of protonated D8PG, based on the comparison of a series of PGs (33Wang G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 3271-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Wang G. Open Magn. Reson. J. 2008; 1: 9-15Crossref Google Scholar), also provides a good opportunity to measure the interactions between cationic LL-37 and anionic PGs. The through-space dipole-dipole interactions between protons (<5 Å) are manifested in intermolecular NOESY spectra (16Wang G. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 50-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Wang G. Treleaven W.D. Cushley R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Such NOE cross peaks were found to build up as normal intramolecular NOE peaks, indicating direct dipole-dipole interactions (26Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 33Wang G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 3271-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the aromatic rings of Phe-5, Phe-6, Phe-17, and Phe-27 of LL-37 on the concave hydrophobic surface (Fig. 2C) all displayed NOE cross peaks with the D8PG C3-C7 protons at 1.23 ppm. Similar cross peaks were also observed when one-dimensional slices were taken in the two-dimensional spectrum corresponding to lipid signals at 2.34 ppm (C2-H) and 5.25 ppm (Hβ). These lipid signals possess unique chemical shifts and do not overlap with the peptide signals under investigation. As there are NOE cross peaks from the peptide to both lipid head group and acyl chain protons, LL-37 binds to the interfacial region of the lipid micelles. Furthermore, slice analysis facilitates the viewing of some weaker NOE cross peaks such as those between arginine side-chain protons and D8PG (pointed with arrows in Fig. 3D). Such Arg-PG cross peaks, albeit being weak, were also detected using an engineered LL-37 peptide (33Wang G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 3271-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), providing long-desired evidence for Arg-PG interactions. Observations of similar NOE cross peaks from lysines to PGs would be more difficult due to fast exchange of the side chain NH protons with solvents. Identification and Structural Determination of the Shortest Antibacterial Peptide Derived from LL-37—The existence of a helical bend between residues 14–16 in LL-37 allows us to classify micelle-bound human cathelicidin into three structural and functional regions. The N-terminal region (residues 1–13, labeled as I in Fig. 2B) has been implicated in chemotaxis (37Braff M.H. Hawkins M.A. Di Nardo A. Lopez-Garcia B. Howell M.D. Wong C. Lin K. Streib J.E. Dorschner R. Leung D.Y. Gallo R.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4271-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), in peptide oligomerization, in conferring proteolysis resistance, and in hemolytic activity of LL-37 (12Oren Z. Lerman J.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of LL-37 (residues 32–37, III in Fig. 2B) is disordered and mobile in complex with SDS, D8PG, or lipopolysaccharides (see online supporting information, supplemental Fig. S1B) and thus plays little role in targeting bacterial membranes. Our previous study found that these C-terminal residues participate in tetramer formation of LL-37 at physiological pH (20Li Y. Li X. Wang G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 54: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether the C-terminal tail of LL-37 is involved in other biological functions. Numerous studies verified that the middle region (residues 17–31, II in Fig. 2B) contains the primary antimicrobial region of LL-37 (37Braff M.H. Hawkins M.A. Di Nardo A. Lopez-Garcia B.

However, very little is known about the specific nature of the degradation process. We developed a new method to detect mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) by fusing the green fluorescent protein at the C terminus of two endogenous mitochondrial proteins and monitored vacuolar release of green fluorescent protein. Using this method, we screened several atg mutants and found that ATG11, a gene that is essential only for selective autophagy, is also essential for mitophagy. In addition, we found that mitophagy is blocked even under severe starvation conditions, if the carbon source makes mitochondria essential for metabolism. These findings suggest that the degradation of mitochondria is a tightly regulated process and that these organelles are largely protected from nonspecific autophagic degradation.

These findings suggest that the degradation of mitochondria is a tightly regulated process and that these organelles are largely protected from nonspecific autophagic degradation. The mitochondrion is an organelle that carries out a number of important metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria also have a key role in the regulation of apoptosis (1Keeble J.A. Gilmore A.P. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation supplies a large amount of energy that contributes to a range of cellular activities. However, this organelle is also the major source of cellular reactive oxygen species that cause damage to mitochondrial lipid, DNA, and proteins, and the accumulation of this damage is related to aging, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Thus, quality control of mitochondria is important to maintain cellular homeostasis. In fact, mitochondria have some of their own quality control systems including a protein degradation system (3Rep M. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), DNA repair enzymes (4Larsson N.G. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev.

Umeda M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4924-4933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, it has long been assumed that autophagy is the pathway for mitochondrial recycling, and various theories suggest that a specific targeting of damaged mitochondria to vacuoles or lysosomes occurs by autophagy (7Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), although there is little direct experimental evidence for selective recognition of mitochondria. Very recently, several studies suggest that selective mitochondrial degradation via autophagy (mitophagy) might play an important role for mitochondrial quality control (8Mijaljica D. Prescott M. Devenish R.J. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Vallette F.M. di Rago J.P. Martinou J.C.

Autophagy. 2007; 3: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy is the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components that allows cells to respond to various types of stress and to adapt to changing nutrient conditions (13Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 14Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 279-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After certain environmental cues such as nutrient deprivation or hormonal stimuli, cells dynamically sequester portions of the cytoplasm within double-membrane cytosolic vesicles, called autophagosomes, and the completed vesicles subsequently fuse with lysosomes/vacuoles (15Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 16Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). There are a number of selective autophagy pathways that appear to target specific cellular components, and the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) 2The abbreviations used are: Cvt, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PAS, phagophore assembly site. pathway and pexophagy are well understood examples. The Cvt pathway is an autophagy-like process that encompasses the biosynthetic routes of two known proteins, aminopeptidase I (Ape1) and α-mannosidase, without delivering any additional known cargo to the vacuole (16Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 17Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Pexophagy is the selective degradation of peroxisomes via autophagy that occurs particularly when cells are shifted from conditions where these organelles are required for metabolism to ones where they are no longer necessary (18Dunn Jr., W.A. Cregg J.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Oku M. Sakai Y. Sibirny A.A. Stasyk O.V. Veenhuis M. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence from yeast to mammal that suggest that mitophagy is another type of selective autophagy. In mammalian cells, the mitochondrial permeability transition induces mitochondrial degradation (19Rodriguez-Enriquez S. He L. Lemasters J.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2463-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Elmore S.P. Qian T. Grissom S.F. Lemasters J.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2286-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and daughter mitochondria with reduced membrane potential after a fission event are more likely to be targeted by autophagy (11Twig G. Elorza A. Molina A.J. Mohamed H. Wikstrom J.D. Walzer G. Stiles L. Haigh S.E. Katz S. Las G. Alroy J. Wu M. Py B.F. Yuan J. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. Shirihai O.S. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). In yeast, alterations of F0F1-ATPase biogenesis in a conditional mutant triggers autophagy (9Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Vallette F.M. di Rago J.P. Martinou J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, Aup1 and Uth1, both mitochondrial proteins, have been shown to be essential in inducing mitophagy (21Tal R. Winter G. Ecker N. Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Kissova I. Deffieu M. Manon S. Camougrand N. J. Biol.

Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The molecular breakthroughs in autophagy including the identification of the molecular components of the Cvt pathway and pexophagy have taken place during only the past decade. The start of the molecular realm of autophagy began with the identification of autophagy-related (ATG) genes by genetic screening in yeast (24Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 25Klionsky D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). To date, 31 ATG genes have been identified, and the biological properties of some Atg proteins have been characterized. Compared with autophagy, the genetic and molecular mechanisms of mitophagy are still poorly understood. This is in part due to the absence of a sensitive and convenient method for mitophagy induction and detection. For example, Tal et al. (21Tal R. Winter G. Ecker N. Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) culture cells for more than 3 days to induce mitophagy, and Kissova et al., (23Kissova I. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Bhatia S. Manon S. Camougrand N. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) use electron microscopy to detect the presence of mitochondria in the vacuole. In this study, we established a sensitive and convenient method to monitor mitophagy. Using this method, we screened several atg mutants and found that ATG11, a gene that is essential for only selective autophagy, is also essential for mitophagy. In addition, we found that mitophagy is blocked even under severe starvation conditions, if the carbon source makes mitochondria essential for metabolism. These findings suggest that the degradation of mitochondria is a tightly regulated process and that these organelles may be protected from nonspecific autophagic degradation.

Yeast cells were grown in rich medium (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), lactate medium (YPL; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% lactate), synthetic minimal medium with glucose (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, amino acids, and vitamins), synthetic minimal medium with galactose (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% galactose, amino acids, and vitamins), or synthetic minimal medium with lactate (SML; 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% lactate, amino acids, and vitamins). Starvation experiments were performed in synthetic minimal medium lacking nitrogen (SD-N; 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose; or SL-N, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% lactate).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY4742MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0InvitrogenCWY239SEY6210 atg17Δ::KANRef. 39Cheong H.

Plasmids and Antibodies—A doxycycline-regulated Mdm38-HA expression strain was generated by PCR amplification of the MDM38 gene with an HA tag from yeast genomic DNA using the following primers: 5-MDM38–1M-BamH1, 5′-ATATGGATCCATGTTGAATTTCGCATCAAGAGCG-3′; 3-MDM38-HAstop-Pst1, 5′-ATATCTGCAGCTAAGCATAGTCAGGCACATCATAGGGGTAATCTTTCTTAATGACAAAAGTCTTCGC-3′. The BamHI-PstI fragment was inserted into the respective site of the vector pCM189, yielding pTet-MDM38HA. The plasmid to express Myc-tagged Atg11 (pMyc-Atg11) has been described previously (17Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody clone 7.1 and 13.1 mixture (Roche Applied Science), monoclonal anti-YFP antibody clone JL8 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and anti-Pgk1 antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Jeremy Thorner (University of California, Berkeley)) were used for immunoblotting. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells expressing fusion proteins with fluorescent tags were grown in YPL medium for the indicated times, and then cells were washed in SML medium before observation. Fluorescence signals were visualized on a wide field fluorescence inverted microscope (Olympus IX-70; Mellville, NY) equipped with a 100× oil NA 1.4 objective lens and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. The images were captured by a Photometrix CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Mitophagy Assays—For Assay 1, cells grown in YPD medium to mid-log phase were shifted to YPL medium (starting from A600 = 0.1) for 12 h. For starvation, the cells were washed in water two times and cultured in SD-N. The cells were collected at 0, 4, and 6 h, and the cell lysates equivalent to A600 = 0.1 unit of cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis. For Assay 2, cells grown in YPD medium to mid-log phase were shifted to YPL medium (starting from A600 = 0.1). After 12 ± 2 h (day 1), 36 ± 5 h (day 2), and 60 ± 5 h (day 3), the cells were collected and used for immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy analysis. Assays for Autophagy and Pexophagy—For monitoring bulk autophagy, the alkaline phosphatase activity of Pho8Δ60 and processing of GFP-Atg8 were carried out as described previously (27Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 28Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29889-29894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Pex14-GFP processing to monitor pexophagy has been described previously (29Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yen W.-L. Legakis J.E. Nair U. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Monitoring Mitophagy Using C-terminal GFP-tagged Mitochondrial Protein Processing and Fluorescence Microscopy—To establish a method to induce and detect mitophagy in yeast, we took advantage of the observation that GFP present in fusion constructs is relatively stable within the vacuole lumen and is often released as an intact protein after delivery to the vacuole (28Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29889-29894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tagged the C terminus of several different mitochondrial proteins with GFP and monitored mitophagy by examining the localization and degradation of the chimera, with the concomitant release of free GFP, in the vacuole under several culture conditions. When cells were grown in medium with 2% lactate as the sole carbon source (YPL) for more than 12 h and then shifted to SD-N medium, two of the GFP-tagged mitochondrial proteins, the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Om45 and the matrix protein Idh1, showed GFP processing to an extent that depended on the duration of nitrogen starvation (Fig. 1, WT). This processing was not dependent on mitochondrial endogenous proteinases (such as Lon or Clp1), because both a mitochondrial outer membrane and matrix protein showed the same result. In contrast, strains deleted for ATG1, encoding a protein kinase essential for macroautophagy, or PEP4, one of the main vacuolar hydrolases, did not show GFP processing, suggesting that the appearance of free GFP was autophagy- and vacuole-dependent (Fig. 1). Recently it was reported that a mitochondrially targeted GFP protein accumulates in the vacuole after long term growth in lactate medium (21Tal R. Winter G. Ecker N. Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5617-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We cultured wild-type cells expressing Om45-GFP or Idh1-GFP in YPL medium for 1–3 days and monitored GFP processing and accumulation in the vacuole. After 2 days of growth in YPL, the GFP fluorescence became very clear in the vacuole (Fig. 2A, top panels), and at the same time, GFP was processed (Fig. 2, B and C, WT). The absence of Atg1 blocked both GFP processing and vacuolar GFP accumulation (Fig. 2). In contrast, deletion of PEP4 blocked GFP processing (Fig. 2, B and C) but showed vacuolar dotted fluorescence likely corresponding to autophagic bodies containing mitochondria as a cargo (Fig. 2A, bottom panels). These findings reconfirmed that processing of GFP-tagged mitochondrial proteins is autophagy-dependent and suggests that we are monitoring actual mitophagy. The time course of cell growth and mitophagy in lactate medium revealed that mitophagy was induced when cells reached post-log to stationary phase growth (data not shown). Previous studies have examined mitochondrial degradation induced by the doxycycline-regulated shut-off of the MDM38 gene (10Nowikovsky K. Reipert S. Devenish R.J. Schweyen R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or by impairing the bioenergetic status and the biogenesis of mitochondria using mutants defective in assembly or stability of the F0F1-ATPase (9Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Vallette F.M. di Rago J.P. Martinou J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We used an identical doxycycline-regulated MDM38 strain and separately used the mitochondrial complex V (ATP synthase) inhibitor oligomycin to determine whether our system relying on cleavage of OM45-GFP replicated these results. We found that free GFP was detected in either case, although the amount of processed GFP was extremely low compared with the mitophagy induction shown above (supplemental Fig. S1A and S2). Therefore, we repeated the analysis with oligomycin examining the effect over time and found that there was an increase in mitophagy that corresponded to the exposure time to the drug (supplemental Fig. S1B). These results fit with the previous findings that interference with the function of the F0F1-ATPase induces mitophagy (9Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Vallette F.M. di Rago J.P. Martinou J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Mitophagy Is Regulated Independent from Macroautophagy—Having developed a system that can be used to monitor mitophagy, we next wanted to address the question of whether this process can occur in a selective manner. When cells are cultured with a nonfermentable carbon source, a situation where cells require mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for cell growth, the number of mitochondria and the mass amount of mitochondrial proteins are increased (31Ibrahim N.G. Stuchell R.N. Beattie D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Visser W. van Spronsen E.A. Nanninga N. Pronk J.T. Gijs Kuenen J. van Dijken J.P. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1995; 67: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If the medium is shifted to a fermentable carbon source, the level of mitochondria is eventually decreased. To determine whether the reduction of mitochondria is caused by mitophagy, wild-type cells expressing Om45-GFP were grown in YPL medium to mid-log phase and shifted to glucose medium (YPD) for 6 h, and mitophagy was monitored by GFP processing. Under these conditions, however, mitophagy was barely detected (data not shown). On the other hand, if we shifted the cells to SD-N medium, we detected a substantial level of free GFP (Fig. 3A). In contrast, when cells cultured in YPL were shifted to nitrogen starvation medium supplemented with lactate (SL-N) instead of glucose, mitophagy occurred at a very low level (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that detectable levels of mitophagy were not induced simply by shifting to a fermentable carbon source (YPD) or by shifting to starvation conditions in the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source (SL-N). To determine whether the lack of GFP processing reflected a block in mitophagy or a general block in macroautophagy, we next examined a marker for the latter process. Atg8 is one of two Atg proteins that remain associated with the completed autophagosome. Therefore, processing of GFP-Atg8 can be used to monitor nonspecific autophagy (34Klionsky D.J. Cuervo A.M. Seglen P.O. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 181-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We expressed GFP-Atg8 in the same cell background and monitored GFP-Atg8 processing after shifting to SD-N or SL-N. In this case, the amount of processed GFP was almost the same in both conditions, indicating that SL-N medium still induced a starvation response (Fig. 3B). To measure autophagic activity quantitatively, we used an additional assay. Pho8Δ60 is a truncated form of the vacuolar membrane enzyme alkaline phosphatase, which is normally delivered to this organelle through a portion of the secretory pathway. Pho8Δ60 lacks the N-terminal transmembrane domain that serves as an internal uncleaved signal sequence, and the altered protein remains in the cytosol; it is only delivered to the vacuole by autophagy, which results in cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide and enzyme activation. Thus, this assay monitors nonspecific autophagy (27Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 35Klionsky D.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 390: 363-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed Om45-GFP in the Pho8Δ60 strain and then monitored mitophagy and autophagic activity. As before, mitophagy was barely induced after cells were shifted to SL-N compared with SD-N. On the other hand, autophagic activity based on Pho8Δ60 activity was almost the same in both conditions (Fig. 3, C and D). Screening atg Mutants for Potential Mitophagy Defects—Currently, 31 genes are denoted as autophagy-related (ATG). We examined the mitophagy capacity of the atg mutants during starvation. ATG genes that are essential for both specific and nonspecific autophagy such as ATG8 and ATG9 were also essential for mitophagy (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3), in agreement with previous reports (12Zhang Y. Qi H. Taylor R. Xu W. Liu L.F. Jin S. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21Tal R. Winter G. Ecker N. Klionsky D.J. Abeliovich H. J. Biol.

Autophagy. 2007; 3: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Atg19 functions as a receptor for precursor Ape1 (prApe1) and is specific for the Cvt pathway (36Shintani T. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and the absence of Atg19 did not affect mitophagy. In contrast, the atg11Δ mutant was completely blocked for the degradation of mitochondria (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3). Atg11 appears to function as an adaptor or scaffold protein and is needed for both the Cvt pathway and pexophagy but not for nonspecific autophagy (37Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M. Scott S.V. Ohsumi Y. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The block in mitophagy seen in the atg11Δ strain was rescued by expressing Myc-tagged Atg11 (data not shown), indicating that the defect was due to the absence of this protein. To determine whether this block was specific to the atg11Δ strain, we next examined other atg mutant strains that are defective for selective autophagy but that have little or no effect on bulk autophagy. The atg20Δ and atg24Δ strains both showed a strong block in mitophagy, although not as severe as that seen with atg11Δ (Fig. 4A). Essentially the same results were obtained at the post-logarithmic phase in lactate medium (Fig. 5). Because the atg11Δ, atg20Δ, and atg24Δ strains displayed substantial blocks in mitophagy but are essentially normal for macroautophagy (37Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30198-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that mitophagy is a selective process. The atg17Δ, atg29Δ, and atg31Δ strains are normal for the Cvt pathway and display substantial but not complete blocks in autophagy (30Yen W.-L. Legakis J.E. Nair U. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol.

Commun. 2005; 338: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These strains also showed significant blocks in mitophagy that varied depending on the culture conditions (Figs. 4B and 5). Relationship between Selective Autophagy and ATG Genes—Mitophagy is a selective type of organelle degradation, whereas the Cvt pathway is a biosynthetic route for the delivery of resident vacuolar hydrolases. Even though the Cvt pathway uses most of the same autophagic machinery as nonspecific autophagy, we decided to examine another type of selective organelle degradation, pexophagy. Accordingly, we tagged various atg mutant strains with Pex14-GFP. Pex14 is a peroxisomal membrane protein, and processing of Pex14-GFP can be used to monitor autophagic degradation of peroxisomes (41Reggiori F. Monastyrska I. Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5843-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Pexophagy has been analyzed in some of the atg mutants (29Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W1992789817,"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). In order to map the neuroanatomic origins of the complex neuropsychiatric behaviors observed in patients with RTT and to uncover endogenous functions of MeCP2 in the hypothalamus, we removed Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus using Cre-loxP technology. Loss of MeCP2 in Sim1-expressing neurons resulted in mice that recapitulated the abnormal physiological stress response that is seen upon MeCP2 dysfunction in the entire brain. Surprisingly, we also uncovered a role for MeCP2 in the regulation of social and feeding behaviors since the Mecp2 conditional knockout (CKO) mice were aggressive, hyperphagic, and obese. This study demonstrates that deleting Mecp2 in a defined brain region is an excellent approach to map the neuronal origins of complex behaviors and provides new insight about the function of MeCP2 in specific neurons.

This study demonstrates that deleting Mecp2 in a defined brain region is an excellent approach to map the neuronal origins of complex behaviors and provides new insight about the function of MeCP2 in specific neurons. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a devastating X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that affects ∼1 in 10,000 females (Moretti and Zoghbi, 2006Moretti P. Zoghbi H.Y. MeCP2 dysfunction in Rett syndrome and related disorders.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Patients with classic RTT suffer from a broad array of phenotypes that affect almost every part of the central and autonomic nervous systems (Glaze, 2005Glaze D.G. Neurophysiology of Rett syndrome.J. Child Neurol. 2005; 20: 740-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Weaving et al., 2005Weaving L.S. Ellaway C.J. Gecz J. Christodoulou J. Rett syndrome: clinical review and genetic update.J. Med. Genet. 2005; 42: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These phenotypes include impaired social behavior and communication skills, motor abnormalities, and the development of stereotyped movements (Hagberg, 2002Hagberg B. Clinical manifestations and stages of Rett syndrome.Ment. Retard. Dev. Disabil. Res. Rev. 2002; 8: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The majority (>95%) of RTT cases are caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein widely expressed throughout the brain (Williamson and Christodoulou, 2006Williamson S.L. Christodoulou J. Rett syndrome: new clinical and molecular insights.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 14: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Zoghbi, 2005Zoghbi H.Y. MeCP2 dysfunction in humans and mice.J. Child Neurol. 2005; 20: 736-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to classic RTT, patients with MECP2 mutations manifest a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism, juvenile onset schizophrenia, and bipolar disease, with mental retardation depending on the type of mutation or the pattern of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) (Cohen et al., 2002Cohen D. Lazar G. Couvert P. Desportes V. Lippe D. Mazet P. Heron D. MECP2 mutation in a boy with language disorder and schizophrenia.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2002; 159: 148-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Weaving et al., 2003Weaving L.S. Williamson S.L. Bennetts B. Davis M. Ellaway C.J. Leonard H. Thong M.K. Delatycki M.

A. 2003; 118A: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Girls typically have features of classic RTT when they have random XCI, whereby half of their cells express a mutant MECP2 allele (Shahbazian et al., 2002bShahbazian M.D. Sun Y. Zoghbi H.Y. Balanced X chromosome inactivation patterns in the Rett syndrome brain.Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 111: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Takagi, 2001Takagi N. The role of X-chromosome inactivation in the manifestation of Rett syndrome.Brain Dev. 2001; 23: S182-S185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, patients with skewed patterns of XCI favoring the wild-type (WT) allele might display only a few features, such as autism, tremor, or other neurobehavioral deficits. Because the majority of cells in girls with favorable XCI patterns express the WT allele, the isolated phenotypes might result from loss of MeCP2 function in particular brain regions. The creation of several mouse models carrying different Mecp2 mutations enabled the recapitulation of many of the phenotypes seen in patients and has enhanced our appreciation of the breadth of clinical phenotypes that are associated with RTT. Mecp2 null mice display tremor, breathing dysfunction, and hind-limb clasping; are overweight (on a mixed 129, C57BL/6, BALB/c genetic background); and die by 10 weeks (Chen et al., 2001Chen R.Z. Akbarian S. Tudor M. Jaenisch R. Deficiency of methyl-CpG binding protein-2 in CNS neurons results in a Rett-like phenotype in mice.Nat.

A mouse Mecp2-null mutation causes neurological symptoms that mimic Rett syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Mice bearing a truncated Mecp2 allele (Mecp2308/Y) are overweight (on a 129 Sv/Ev background, unpublished data); display motor dysfunction, seizures, stereotypies, altered social behavior, abnormal stress responses, and anxiety-like behavior; and die by 15 months of age (McGill et al., 2006McGill B.E.

Mice with truncated MeCP2 recapitulate many Rett syndrome features and display hyperacetylation of histone H3.Neuron. 2002; 35: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Conditional deletion of Mecp2 from neurons that express CaMKII-Cre93 throughout the forebrain and midbrain reproduces a large subset of RTT features, including abnormal motor coordination, anxiety-like behavior, impaired learning and memory, and weight gain (Gemelli et al., 2006Gemelli T. Berton O. Nelson E.D. Perrotti L.I. Jaenisch R. Monteggia L.M.

Psychiatry. 2006; 59: 468-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The overweight phenotype seen in each of the mouse models was initially perplexing given that girls with classic RTT are typically thin and often suffer from growth failure predominantly because of feeding difficulties due to oropharyngeal dysmotility (difficulty chewing and swallowing) (Motil et al., 1999Motil K.J. Schultz R.J. Browning K. Trautwein L. Glaze D.G. Oropharyngeal dysfunction and gastroesophageal dysmotility are present in girls and women with Rett syndrome.J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1999; 29: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, upon reflection on the clinical course of many patients with MECP2 mutations who do not display classic RTT, we noticed that males with hypomorphic MECP2 mutations and females with milder variants of RTT often become obese (Couvert et al., 2001Couvert P. Bienvenu T. Aquaviva C. Poirier K. Moraine C. Gendrot C. Verloes A. Andres C. Le Fevre A.C. Souville I. et al.MECP2 is highly mutated in X-linked mental retardation.Hum. Mol.

Studying patients with RTT, as well as mouse models of RTT, is a daunting task given the incredible range of phenotypes that stem from MeCP2 dysfunction in all neurons. Moreover, it is very difficult to dissociate phenotypes attributable to dysfunction of MeCP2 from secondary compensatory changes. Given the clinical observation that different patterns of XCI likely result in the manifestation of distinct subsets of RTT phenotypes, we proposed that particular RTT phenotypes result from loss of function of MeCP2 in specific neurons and that deleting Mecp2 from small groups of neurons in the mouse will enable us to map specific neurobehavioral phenotypes to discrete brain regions or cell types. Furthermore, we reasoned that this strategy should allow us to uncover endogenous functions of MeCP2 that might otherwise be masked in the constitutive Mecp2 null mice that display many phenotypes. In this work, we focus on the hypothalamus because patients with MECP2 mutations display many phenotypes suggestive of hypothalamic dysfunction, such as sleep abnormalities, episodes of heightened anxiety, an abnormal physiological response to stress as measured by increased levels of cortisol in the urine, gastrointestinal dysfunction, as well as cardiac and breathing abnormalities (Axelrod et al., 2006Axelrod F.B.

In this study, we utilized mice that express Cre recombinase under the control of Sim1 regulatory elements to delete Mecp2 in several regions of the hypothalamus using Cre-loxP technology. We performed a comprehensive battery of behavioral and physiological tests on Mecp2 conditional knockout (CKO) mice and all littermate controls to screen for the presence of both RTT-like and distinct phenotypes, and we discovered that MeCP2 plays a critical role in pathways important for mediating proper physiological responses to stress as well as both social and feeding behaviors. We removed Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons by breeding mice carrying a Mecp2 allele flanked by loxP sites (Mecp2flox/+) (Guy et al., 2001Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. A mouse Mecp2-null mutation causes neurological symptoms that mimic Rett syndrome.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) to Sim1-cre BAC transgenic mice (Balthasar et al., 2005Balthasar N. Dalgaard L.T. Lee C.E. Yu J. Funahashi H. Williams T.

Kenny C.D. et al.Divergence of melanocortin pathways in the control of food intake and energy expenditure.Cell. 2005; 123: 493-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Sim1 regulatory elements drive Cre expression in transgenic mice during embryonic development and after birth in the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and posterior (PH) hypothalamic nuclei, as well as in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT) of the amygdala (Balthasar et al., 2005Balthasar N.

A small amount of scattered Cre expression also occurs in a few other areas surrounding the hypothalamus and amygdala (Balthasar et al., 2005Balthasar N. Dalgaard L.T. Lee C.E. Yu J. Funahashi H. Williams T. Ferreira M. Tang V. McGovern R.A.

Fluorescent immunohistochemistry demonstrated a clear reduction of MeCP2 in all areas where Cre is expressed, including the PVN (Figures 1A and 1B) and SON (Figures 1C and 1D) of Mecp2 conditional knockout (Mecp2 CKO) mice. MeCP2 levels were not altered in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), an area of the hypothalamus where the Cre is not expressed (data not shown). To screen for the presence of RTT-like phenotypes, we performed a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests on Mecp2 CKO mice and all littermate controls (Table 1). Although Mecp2 CKO mice behaved similarly to their littermates in a variety of paradigms (Figure S1 available online), they also reproduced a subset of phenotypes typically detected with MeCP2 dysfunction throughout the brain (Table 1). In light of the increased urinary cortisol excretion in patients with RTT (Motil et al., 2006Motil K.J. Schultz R.J. Abrams S. Ellis K.J. Glaze D.G. Fractional calcium absorption is increased in girls with Rett syndrome.J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol.

Carson J.P. Thaller C. Zoghbi H.Y. Enhanced anxiety and stress-induced corticosterone release are associated with increased Crh expression in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 18267-18272Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we examined endocrine responses to stress in Mecp2 CKO mice. We measured serum levels of corticosterone in Mecp2 CKO and control mice under basal conditions and after 30 min of restraint stress. We found a significant effect of genotype under basal conditions, F(3,28) = 5.28, p = 0.005, and after stress, F(3,27) = 8.70, p < 0.001. Tukey's post hoc comparisons revealed that, under basal conditions, Mecp2flox and Mecp2 CKO mice had similar corticosterone levels compared to WT mice, although their levels were higher than mice that carry only the Sim1-cre transgene (p < 0.05 for both, Figure 2A). Strikingly, after 30 min of restraint, Mecp2 CKO mice had significantly higher corticosterone levels than all littermate controls, and they exhibited a 134% increase in serum corticosterone over WT littermates (p < 0.01, Figure 2A). These results indicate that, similar to patients with RTT and Mecp2308/Y mice, Mecp2 CKO mice have an enhanced physiologic response to stress.Table 1A Summary of the Behavioral Assays and Their Outcome in Mecp2 CKO MiceBehavior AssayPhenotype TestedPhenotype Observed in Mecp2 CKOGeneral health examBody weight, stereotypies, kyphosisYesWire hang and dowelMotor coordinationNoTremor monitoringTremorNoLight-dark boxAnxiety-like behaviorNoOpen fieldAnxiety-like behaviorYesConditioned fearLearning and memoryNoPartition testSocial behaviorYesResident intruderAggressionYesAging of animalsReduced survivalNoA comprehensive battery of behavioral assays was performed on F1 129/FVB male Mecp2 CKO mice and their control littermates (n = 15–17/genotype) to assess whether any RTT-like features were recapitulated after deleting Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons. Open table in a new tab A comprehensive battery of behavioral assays was performed on F1 129/FVB male Mecp2 CKO mice and their control littermates (n = 15–17/genotype) to assess whether any RTT-like features were recapitulated after deleting Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons. We next attempted to determine whether Mecp2 CKO mice also exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior. In the open field, there was a significant effect of genotype for the center-to-total distance ratio, F(3,60) = 7.58, p < 0.001 (Figure 2B). Tukey's post hoc comparison revealed that Mecp2 CKO mice explored the center of an open field significantly less than all controls, a finding consistent with enhanced anxiety-like behavior. The total distance traveled in the open field was similar among Mecp2 CKO and WT mice, indicating that the decreased exploration of the center of the arena by Mecp2 CKO mice was not likely the result of motor impairment (Figure 2C). It should be noted, however, that we did observe a small but significant decrease in the total distance that the Mecp2 CKO mice traveled throughout the test when compared to mice that carry only the Sim1-cre allele (p < 0.01). To confirm that the Mecp2 CKO mice display increased anxiety-like behavior, we performed a light-dark box assay, one of the most widely used and well-documented tests for studying anxiety-like behavior (Bourin and Hascoet, 2003Bourin M. Hascoet M. The mouse light/dark box test.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 463: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated a significant effect of genotype (Mecp2flox × Sim1-cre interaction) on both the percentage of time spent in the lit side, F(1,60) = 4.08, p = 0.048, and the number of transitions between compartments, F(1,60) = 5.85, p = 0.019. Interestingly, however, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc analysis revealed that Mecp2 CKO mice spent a similar amount of time in the lit side of the light-dark box compared to all littermate controls (Figure 2D). Furthermore, the number of transitions between compartments and the latency to enter the dark were not different between Mecp2 CKO mice and WT controls (data not shown). Thus, although Mecp2 CKO mice clearly display an increased physiological response to stress and a decreased center-to-total distance ratio in the open field assay, the light-dark data do not reveal increased anxiety-like behavior in the Mecp2 CKO mice. Mecp2 CKO mice also behaved abnormally in the partition test, which is designed to evaluate social behavior. In this test, two mice are placed in a cage divided by a clear and perforated plexiglass partition, and the amount of time that the test mouse spends near the partition investigating either a familiar or an unfamiliar partner is recorded. Repeated-measures ANOVA (genotype × time) revealed a significant effect, F(3,59) = 10.65, p < 0.001, and Tukey's post hoc analysis demonstrated that Mecp2 CKO mice (p < 0.001) and mice that carry only the Mecp2flox allele (p < 0.05) spent more time at the partition compared to control littermates, suggesting increased social interaction (Figure 2E). This Mecp2flox effect is consistent with data reported in a recent study (Samaco et al., 2008Samaco R.C. Fryer J.D. Ren J. Fyffe S. Chao H.T. Sun Y. Greer J.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Neul J.L. A partial loss of function allele of methyl-CpG-binding protein predicts a human neurodevelopmental syndrome.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1718-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that mice carrying the Mecp2flox allele express 50% less MeCP2 compared to WT littermates, highlighting the importance of including Mecp2flox mice as controls when interpreting data from Mecp2 CKO experiments. Interestingly, we noticed that Mecp2 CKO and Mecp2flox mice engaged in very different behaviors at the partition. Mice that carry only the Mecp2flox allele demonstrated typical social interactions, such as sniffing and exploration. In contrast, Mecp2 CKO mice were preoccupied with aggressive behaviors, such as tail rattling directed toward the unfamiliar partner. To further characterize these aggressive behaviors, we used the resident intruder assay. Prior to testing the response of a resident mouse to an intruder, the test mice were singly housed for 2 weeks, a procedure believed to enhance territoriality. On the test day, we recorded aggressive behaviors after placing a smaller, unfamiliar, group-housed WT mouse into the home cage of the test mouse. Scores used to denote aggressive behaviors included the number of attacks, mounting, biting, and tail rattling events. Mecp2 CKO mice engaged in significantly more tail rattles (p < 0.01) and aggressive attacks (p < 0.01) than their control littermates (Figure 2F and Movies S1 and S2). In fact, out of the 24 control littermates tested, not a single tail rattle or attack was recorded during the test period. Notably, the aggression observed in Mecp2 CKO mice appears to be limited to situations when they are stressed, either as a result of being singly housed or as a specific reaction to novel intruders of their territory, since they do not attack their familiar cage mates. Furthermore, they are not aggressive toward the examiner when they are handled. Mecp2 CKO mice fed regular mouse chow ad libitum exhibited significantly increased body weight after 7 weeks of age (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA [Mecp2flox × Sim1-cre], lower-bound F(1,60) = 19.59, p < 0.001, Tukey's post hoc p < 0.01; Figures 3A and 3B). Mecp2 CKO mice weigh 27% more than their control littermates by 18 weeks and 48% more by 42 weeks (Figures 3B and S2). We examined linear growth and found that Mecp2 CKO mice also exhibit a small (3%) but significant (p < 0.05) increase in body length compared to littermate controls at 42 weeks of age (data not shown). To determine whether the observed weight gain was due to increased adiposity, we dissected and weighed intra-abdominal gonadal fat pads. We found a significant effect of genotype, F(3,28) = 8.91, p < 0.001, and Tukey's post hoc comparison revealed that gonadal fat pad masses were greatly increased in the Mecp2 CKO mice compared to all controls (p < 0.01, Figure 3C), suggesting that their increased body weight is primarily due to an increase in body fat deposition. In order to confirm these findings, we performed dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans on Mecp2 CKO mice to determine body composition. DEXA analysis indicated that Mecp2 CKO mice had increased total body fat percentages (36% ± 3%) compared to control littermates (20% ± 1%) at 20 weeks of age (p < 0.05, Figure 3D). These data demonstrate that the increased body weight in Mecp2 CKO mice is primarily due to increased body fat. To probe the cause of obesity in the Mecp2 CKO mice, we used an automated home cage monitoring system to evaluate daily activity and food intake. Average daily total movement values were not significantly different between Mecp2 CKO mice and control littermates, although a trend toward hypoactivity (p = 0.066) was noted in the Mecp2 CKO mice (Figure 4A). Interestingly, on experimental day 1, Mecp2 CKO mice completely lacked the novelty-induced hyperactivity response that is normally seen in WT mice (Figure 4A), likely due to heightened anxiety. We evaluated oxygen consumption using indirect calorimetry and found that Mecp2 CKO mice have normal basal metabolic rates (Figure 4B). Together, these data suggest that the marked obesity observed in the Mecp2 CKO mice is not secondary to a decrease in energy expenditure. We next evaluated energy consumption by monitoring daily food intake. After a 4 day acclimation period, we analyzed food consumption over a subsequent 4 day period. We found a significant effect of genotype, F(3,26) = 13.17, p < 0.001, and Tukey's post hoc comparison revealed that Mecp2 CKO mice are hyperphagic, consuming, on average, 42% more chow than WT controls (p < 0.001, Figure 4C). Interestingly, Mecp2 CKO mice did not consume extra chow compared to WT mice throughout the 24 hr period (experimental day 1) immediately after they were singly housed in novel cages, suggesting that they experienced stress-induced suppression of food intake during that period (Figure 4C). Feeding behavior is regulated by several signaling molecules and hormones (for a recent review, see Oswal and Yeo, 2007Oswal A. Yeo G.S. The leptin melanocortin pathway and the control of body weight: lessons from human and murine genetics.Obes. Rev. 2007; 8: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One major signal that the body uses to sense energy balance is leptin, a soluble hormone secreted by adipocytes to communicate body fat deposition information to the brain. To investigate possible mechanisms responsible for mediating the hyperphagia in Mecp2 CKO mice, we measured serum leptin levels. We did not detect any significant difference in serum leptin at 6 weeks of age, but, by 42 weeks, we found a significant effect of genotype, F(2,17) = 31.48, p < 0.001, and Tukey's post hoc comparison revealed that Mecp2 CKO mice had a 4-fold increase (p < 0.001) in leptin compared to WT controls (Figure 4D). The observation that Mecp2 CKO mice are obese in the context of elevated leptin suggests that they are able to produce and secrete leptin but are insensitive to its effects. Furthermore, because leptin levels are normal at 6 weeks, prior to the onset of obesity, we conclude that the increased leptin levels likely result from increased fat deposition in the older mice and are not due to direct leptin regulation by MeCP2. Since the melanocortin pathway is an important mediator of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus (Oswal and Yeo, 2007Oswal A. Yeo G.S. The leptin melanocortin pathway and the control of body weight: lessons from human and murine genetics.Obes. Rev. 2007; 8: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we next evaluated the expression of several members of this pathway, including the melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r), pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc1), agouti-related protein (Agrp), and neuropeptide Y (Npy), by in situ hybridization in Mecp2 CKO mice and control littermates. POMC and AgRP/NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) are activated and repressed by leptin, respectively, and they project to the PVN where POMC neurons stimulate and AgRP/NPY neurons block the activity of MC4Rs (Haskell-Luevano and Monck, 2001Haskell-Luevano C. Monck E.K. Agouti-related protein functions as an inverse agonist at a constitutively active brain melanocortin-4 receptor.Regul.

Leptin increases hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA expression in the rostral arcuate nucleus.Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proper MC4R signaling in the PVN is critical for the regulation of food intake (Balthasar et al., 2005Balthasar N. Dalgaard L.T. Lee C.E. Yu J. Funahashi H. Williams T. Ferreira M. Tang V. McGovern R.A. Kenny C.D. et al.Divergence of melanocortin pathways in the control of food intake and energy expenditure.Cell. 2005; 123: 493-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). RNA in situ hybridization revealed that expression of Mc4r in the PVN (Figures 5A and 5B) and Pomc1 (Figures 5C and 5D) and Agrp in the ARC (Figures 5E and 5F) was not altered in Mecp2 CKO mice. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (QRT-PCR) using cDNA from hypothalamus confirmed that Mc4r, Pomc1, and Agrp mRNA levels were not significantly different between Mecp2 CKO mice and control littermates (data not shown). In contrast, Npy expression was reduced in the ARC but greatly induced in the DMH of Mecp2 CKO mice (Figures 5G and 5H). Increased expression of Npy in the DMH occurs in several hyperphagic models of reduced MC4R signaling, including the agouti yellow mutant (Ay), Mc4r −/− mice, and WT rats during lactation, suggesting that Npy in the DMH may be involved in feeding regulation mediated by MC4R signaling (Chen et al., 2004Chen P.

A subset of these enzymes, including cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1), are known for their role in the clearance of drugs and other xenobiotics by introducing or unmasking sites for subsequent conjugation and elimination from the body. From a biochemical standpoint these enzymes are fascinating for the diversity of substrates each xenobiotic-metabolizing P-450 can metabolize, yet often with exquisite selectivity in the metabolites generated. Unfortunately, in the process some P-450-mediated metabolism can produce toxic or carcinogenic products. Among cytochrome P-450 enzymes, CYP2E1 is particularly notable for this ability and the resulting toxicity (1Ioannides C. Lewis D.F. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1767-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This activity is most substantial in the liver because CYP2E1 comprises over 50% of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 mRNA (2Bieche I. Narjoz C. Asselah T. Vacher S. Marcellin P. Lidereau R. Beaune P. de Waziers I. Pharmacogenet. Genomics. 2007; 17: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and 7% of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 protein (3Shimada T. Yamazaki H. Mimura M. Inui Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 414-423PubMed Google Scholar). However, CYP2E1 is also expressed at lower levels in a variety of extrahepatic tissues (4Ding X. Kaminsky L.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 149-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), where it is thought to play a role in the metabolism of important endogenous molecules. CYP2E1 levels and the resulting toxicity varies markedly in response to alcohol consumption (5Nanji A.A. Zhao S. Sadrzadeh S.M. Dannenberg A.J. Tahan S.R. Waxman D.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 1280-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), diabetes (6Barnett C.R. Rudd S. Flatt P.R. Ioannides C. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar), and fasting (8Johansson I. Ekstrom G. Scholte B. Puzycki D. Jornvall H. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, the action of CYP2E1 can have a significant influence on human health and drug metabolism. CYP2E1 has been connected with liver toxicity through two mechanisms: by the activation of substrates into reactive metabolites and potentially by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). When substrate binding, oxygen binding, and electron delivery are not closely coordinated during catalysis, diatomic oxygen can be converted to superoxide or hydrogen peroxide and released instead of being used to monooxygenate the substrate. These ROS have been implicated in a range of damaging events including lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA oxidation. CYP2E1 is considerably more prone to ROS production than other cytochrome P-450 enzymes (9Bell L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29643-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For example, evidence shows that ethanol consumption substantially increases the levels of CYP2E1 protein, and the resulting ROS have been suggested as the primary contributors to the negative physiological consequences of alcohol-induced liver disease (10Lu Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). However, studies with induction of CYP2E1 or CYP2E1 knock-out mice have not detected alterations in the in vivo levels of ROS-mediated isoprostanes, a measure of oxidative stress (11Dostalek M. Hardy K.D. Milne G.L. Morrow J.D. Chen C. Gonzalez F.J. Gu J. Ding X. Johnson D.A. Johnson J.A. Martin M.V. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17147-17157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two well studied drugs that are converted to reactive metabolites by CYP2E1 are acetaminophen (12Patten C.J. Thomas P.E. Guy R.L. Lee M. Gonzalez F.J. Guengerich F.P. Yang C.S. Chem. Res.

Lancet. 1996; 347: 1367-1371Abstract PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Acetaminophen is the most widely used analgesic in the United States (15Larson A.M. Polson J. Fontana R.J. Davern T.J. Lalani E. Hynan L.S. Reisch J.S. Schiodt F.V. Ostapowicz G. Shakil A.O. Lee W.M. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar) and one of the leading causes of fatal poisonings (16Bronstein A.C. Spyker D.A. Cantilena Jr., L.R. Green J. Rumack B.H. Heard S.E. Clin. Toxicol. 2007; 45: 815-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Activation of acetaminophen by CYP2E1 into the strongly electrophilic N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine is the initial and major step responsible for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Halothane is a volatile anesthetic whose use was discontinued because of severe hepatitis induced by CYP2E1 oxidation to trifluoroacetic acid chloride. Trifluoroacetic acid chloride covalently modifies proteins to create an antigen that the body can recognize in later halothane exposures, resulting in severe hepatic necrosis known as halothane hepatitis (17Ray D.C. Drummond G.B. Br. J. Anaesth. 1991; 67: 84-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Acetaminophen and halothane are just two clinical representatives of the >70 low molecular weight (<100 g/mol) substrates that CYP2E1 is known to metabolize. These substrates include industrial solvents such as benzene, toluene, aniline, and halogenated solvents (18Guengerich F.P. Kim D.H. Iwasaki M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar); alcohols such as ethanol (19Koop D.R. Coon M.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp.

Yang C.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1990; 3: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). However, CYP2E1 is also known to metabolize endogenous fatty acids, including lipids associated with signaling mechanisms such as arachidonic acid (23Laethem R.M. Balazy M. Falck J.R. Laethem C.L. Koop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (24Roy U. Joshua R. Stark R.L. Balazy M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The role of CYP2E1 in the metabolism of these signaling molecules may be related to its regulation by disease states such as obesity (25Salazar D.E. Sorge C.L. Corcoran G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and diabetes (26Song B.J. Matsunaga T. Hardwick J.P. Park S.S. Veech R.L. Yang C.S. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in rat models. Although structures of several other important drug-metabolizing cytochromes P-450 have been solved in recent years and a number of CYP2E1 models have been proposed, there are no experimental structures for CYP2E1. Cytochromes P-450 have similar overall tertiary structures but differ substantially in the size and shape of their active sites and the presence and topology of channels allowing substrate entry and metabolite egress, factors that in turn determine substrate selectivity in this enzyme superfamily. To better understand the ability of CYP2E1 to efficiently bind and metabolize both small molecular weight compounds and fatty acids, structures of this enzyme were determined by x-ray crystallography. These structures have been solved in complex with two different small molecular weight inhibitors, indazole (INZ) and 4-methylpyrazole (4MP) (supplemental Fig. S1). Comparison of CYP2E1 structures with those of other human P-450 isoforms provides insight into the functional similarities and differences among the human cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Protein Engineering, Expression, and Purification—The coding region for CYP2E1dH with N-terminal truncations/modifications and a C-terminal His4 tag was generated as described for CYP2B enzymes (27Scott E.E.

This plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. Ingelman-Sundberg (Karolinska Institute). The resulting N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequences are MAKKTSSKGKLPPGP...PRSHHHH (non-native sequence underlined). CYP2E1 was expressed in Escherichia coli TOPP-3 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described (27Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) but in the absence of imidazole and with a 48-h induction time. E. coli cells were harvested and disrupted as previously described in 100 mm Buffer A (potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol) with 1 m NaCl. After removing cellular debris by centrifugation, Cymal-5 (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) was added to 4.8 mm and stirred at 4 °C for 60 min. The solution was ultracentrifuged at 80,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA superflow resin (Qiagen) and washed with 100 mm Buffer A supplemented with 300 mm NaCl and 4.8 mm Cymal-5. The column was washed with 100 mm Buffer A supplemented with 200 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, and 4.8 mm Cymal-5 and CYP2E1 eluted with 50 mm Buffer A supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, 180 mm imidazole, 4.8 mm Cymal-5, and 10 mm EDTA. CYP2E1 fractions were pooled and diluted 5-fold with 5 mm Buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA and 4.8 mm Cymal-5. This solution was applied to a carboxymethyl cellulose column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), washed with the dilution buffer without detergent, and eluted with 50 mm Buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. CYP2E1 fractions were concentrated to 1 ml and loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The final CYP2E1 fractions were pooled and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged for 120 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA containing 5 mm INZ or 10 mm 4MP.

The CYP2E1·INZ complex (50 mg/ml CYP2E1, 5 mm INZ) was equilibrated against 0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 11% iso-propanol, and 6% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, whereas the CYP2E1·4MP complex (50 mg/ml CYP2E1, 10 mm 4MP) was equilibrated against 0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 12% iso-propanol, and 14% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether. The crystals were immersed in 0.1 m NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 10% iso-propanol, 1.4 m sucrose as a cryoprotectant before being flash cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. A single native data set was collected for each complex on Beamline 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford, CA) with a wavelength of 0.979 Å at 100 K. The data were processed using Mosflm (28Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and Scala (29Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). The CYP2E1·INZ structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (30McCoy A.J.

Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar) and a search model consisting of CYP2A13 (Protein Data Bank code 2P85) with nonidentical side chains truncated at the last common atom. The CYP2E1·4MP structure was solved using the CYP2E1·INZ structure as the model. Iterative model building and refinement were performed using COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Graphics. 1990; 8 (29): 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). For the INZ bound CYP2E1 structure the Ramachandran plot showed 89.4% of the amino acid residues in the most favorable region, 9.3% in the additional allowed region, 0.8% in the generously allowed region, and 0.5% in the disallowed region. For the 4MP bound structure the Ramachandran plot showed 88.7% of the amino acids in the most favorable region, 10.5% in the additional allowed region, 0.6% in the generously allowed region, and 0.3% in the disallowed region. Structure Analysis—Probe-occupied voids were calculated using VOIDOO (35Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) with a probe radius of 1.4 Å and a grid mesh of 0.3 Å unless otherwise specified. In the case of CYP2D6, the entire active site volume could not be evaluated in a single calculation. Thus, the CYP2D6 active site was divided into two portions, calculations were performed on both portions, and the volumes were added numerically. This procedure yields a very close approximation of the total CYP2D6 active site volume. CAVER (36Petrek M. Otyepka M. Banas P. Kosinova P. Koca J. Damborsky J. BMC Bioinf. 2006; 7: 316-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) calculations were performed using a grid mesh of 0.8 Å. Protein Design and Structure Determination—Understanding the substrate selectivity of CYP2E1 as it plays roles in drug metabolism and both normal and pathophysiology has been hampered by the absence of experimental structural information about this enzyme. To facilitate structure determination of this integral membrane protein, CYP2E1 was engineered to remove the single N-terminal transmembrane helix (residues 3-23) and add a C-terminal His4 tag, as has been recently used to crystallize other mammalian P-450 enzymes. The resulting truncated protein is a monotypic membrane protein that can be solubilized, purified, and maintained in an active, monodisperse state in the presence of detergent. Absorbance spectra revealed that the purified CYP2E1 was in a mixed spin state, suggesting that in solution some CYP2E1 protein molecules have water bound to the sixth coordination site of the heme iron, but in other molecules the water is absent, and the heme iron is five-coordinate. Most mammalian P-450s are water-coordinated in the resting state, but this mixed spin state has previously been reported for full-length human CYP2E1, although it has also been isolated as either all high spin or all low spin (37Wrighton S.A.

When reconstituted with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome b5, the truncated, purified CYP2E1 is catalytically competent in performing two classic CYP2E1 reactions: 2-hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol and 6-hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone (data not shown). Additionally, this enzyme has Kd values for INZ and 4MP similar to those previously reported for the full-length rabbit CYP2E1 (41Bell-Parikh L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23833-23840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 42Collom S.L. Laddusaw R.M. Burch A.M. Kuzmic P. Perry Jr., M.D. Miller G.P. J. Biol.

Diffraction data were collected to 2.2 Å on a single crystal of CYP2E1 co-crystallized with INZ and to 2.6 Å on a single crystal of CYP2E1 co-crystallized with 4MP. The data collection and refinement statistics are described in Table 1. The final CYP2E1·INZ model includes residues Lys31-Ser493, with the exception of 138-139. The final CYP2E1·4MP model includes residues Lys31-His494, with the exception of residues 138-140. The unmodeled residues are part of a GXG motif in the loop connecting helices C and D, the flexibility of which likely contributed to disorder. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank codes 3E4E and 3E6I).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCYP2E1/4-methylpyrazoleCYP2E1/indazoleData collectionSpace groupP43P43Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)71.1, 71.1, 225.171.2, 71.2, 225.8α, β, γ (°)90.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.0Resolution (Å)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.113.20-2.60 (2.67-2.60)112.51-2.20 (2.26-2.20)RsymaThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.0.061 (0.373)0.080 (0.338)I/σIaThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.16.3 (3.1)15.5 (3.5)Completeness (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.100 (100)99.7 (99.3)RedundancyaThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.3.8 (3.8)5.9 (3.5)RefinementResolution (Å)38.15-2.6041.78-2.20No. of reflections3262953342Rwork/Rfree (%)19.7/27.622.0/28.3No. of atomsProtein7,5437,560Ligand1218Heme8686Water57170B-factorsProtein51.240.1Ligand55.930.0Heme34.431.2Water45.435.3RMSDBond lengths (Å)0.0190.013Bond angles (°)1.911.62a The values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—Both CYP2E1 structures exhibit the canonical P-450 fold consisting of 12 major α-helices and 4 β-sheets, designated A-L and β1-β4, respectively. Short intervening helices typically found in mammalian membrane P-450s are also present and are designated by primes or double primes (Fig. 1A). The two CYP2E1 molecules present in the asymmetric unit of each structure are nearly identical to each other, as are the protein complexes with the two different inhibitors. The root mean square deviations (RMSDs) for the Cα atoms are 0.22 and 0.19 Å between molecules A and B for the INZ and 4MP structures, respectively. The Cα RMSD between the INZ and 4MP structures is similar at 0.23 Å. When compared with other mammalian cytochrome P-450 structures in the Protein Data Bank, CYP2E1 has the highest structural similarity to human CYP2A13 (Protein Data Bank code 2P85; RMSD 1.00 Å) (Fig. 1B) and human CYP2A6 (RMSD 1.03-1.05 Å, depending on the ligand bound to the CYP2A6 structure). Active Site—In the CYP2E1 complex with indazole, there is clear electron density for the inhibitor in the active site (Fig. 2A). One nitrogen of INZ forms a coordinate covalent bond to the heme iron (N2-Fe, 2.19 Å). The adjacent indazole nitrogen hydrogen bonds with the side chain hydroxyl of Thr303. 4MP is an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor used in methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning and also binds tightly to CYP2E1. One 4MP molecule is similarly coordinated to the heme iron via one nitrogen of the pyrazole ring (Fig. 2B, N2-Fe, 1.71 Å) and also hydrogen bonds to Thr303 via the adjacent nitrogen. Coordination of both ligands to the heme iron is consistent with the experimentally observed type II spectral changes that suggest nitrogen replaces water in the sixth coordination position of the iron upon titration with IND or 4MP (data not shown). Although Collom et al. (42Collom S.L. Laddusaw R.M. Burch A.M. Kuzmic P. Perry Jr., M.D. Miller G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3487-3496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported evidence for binding of 4MP at a second site, only one molecule of 4MP was observed in the present structure despite a ∼10-fold molar excess of ligand. In both complexes, the overall active site cavity of CYP2E1 is small, globular, and highly hydrophobic (Fig. 3A). The active site volume was 190 Å3 for the INZ-bound structure and 189.5 Å3 for the 4MP-bound structure, consistent with the small molecular weight of most CYP2E1 substrates. The amino acid residues that line the active site cavity include Ala299 and Thr303 on successive turns of the I helix that bracket the active site. The opposing face of the active site is formed by the intersection of residues in and near the B′ helix (Phe106, Ile115, and Phe116), the loop between helix K and β1-4(Val364 and Leu368) and the β4-1/β4-2 turn (Phe478) (Fig. 3A). A total of five phenylalanine residues (Phe106, Phe116, Phe207, Phe298, and Phe478) form the roof of the active site, many separating the active site from two other enclosed voids. Second Void Adjacent to Active Site—A second enclosed cavity is found adjacent to the active site cavity (Fig. 3). This second isolated cavity has a volume of 77 Å3, is located between the I, F, G, and B′ helices, and is not present in related P-450 enzymes. In CYP2A13 and CYP1A2 a small portion of this area is part of the active site, whereas protein atoms occupy this area in CYP2A6. The active site and this adjacent cavity are separated by the approach of the side chains of Phe106 and Phe298. The narrowest constriction between the two cavities is a distance of 3.8 Å between the atom centers in these two aromatic side chains (Fig. 3B), leaving a gap of 0.4 Å between the van der Waals' surfaces. Residues lining this additional cavity are His109, Leu202, Phe203, Asn206, Val239, Val242, Lys243, Ala294, and Asp295. Access Channel—CYP2E1 also has a broad channel originating adjacent to the active site opposite the I helix (Fig. 3B) and ultimately extending to the surface of the protein. The access channel contains a number of well defined water molecules. The channel is not linear but instead has several side channels toward either side of the F helix, although these channels do not reach the surface. On the protein surface, the single channel opening is surrounded by residues in the loop prior to the B′ helix, the loop between the F′ and G′ helices, and residues from the β1 system (Fig. 4A). At its interior terminus, the access channel is separated from the active site cavity primarily by Phe478 with flanking residues including Leu103 and active site residues Val364 and Leu368 (Fig. 3B). The narrowest constriction is between Phe478 at the tip of the β4 system and Leu103, which immediately precedes the B′ helix (3.7 Å between atom centers leaving a gap of 0.6 Å between van der Waals' surfaces). Slight rotation of Phe478 would easily allow direct communication between the active site and this channel to allow ligand or solvent access and egress. There is space to either side of Phe478 for such a rotation in the access channel (Fig. 4B). Active Site—The size of the immediate active site (190 Å3) is the smallest observed for a human cytochrome P-450 enzyme (Fig. 5) and is consistent with the low molecular weight of many CYP2E1 substrates. CYP2E1-metabolized drugs like the analgesic acetaminophen (151 Da), the muscle relaxant chlorzoxazone (170 Da), the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane (200 Da), and ethanol (46 Da) could all be easily accommodated within this volume, as well as the marker substrate 4-nitrophenol (40 Da). In fact, CYP2E1 has been called a “molecular sieve” (43Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) with respect to its preference for small substrates. Although other isozymes may act on these same substrates with a higher Vmax, CYP2E1 is frequently the low Km or high affinity enzyme. Cytochromes P-450 2A6, 2A13, and 1A2 also have relatively small active site cavities and typical substrates. The volumes of the CYP2A13 and CYP2A6 cavities are 304 and 230 Å3, respectively, whereas the CYP1A2 active site is 406 Å3 (Fig. 5, B-D). Comparison of the CYP2E1 active site cavity with those of CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 indicates that one of the reasons for the decrease in the active site volume is the identity of the residue at position 115, which is directed into the active site. CYP2E1 has Ile at this position, whereas 2A6 and 2A13 have Val and Ala, respectively. Several residues that line the cavity of CYP2A13 are not part of the CYP2E1 active site cavity because other active site residues screen them. For example, in CYP2E1 His109 and Ala294 are cut off from the active site cavity by Phe106 and Phe116; Asp295 is obscured from the active site by Ile115; and Pro363 is positioned behind Val364. The CYP2E1 active site cavity is most open above the heme D pyr-role ring. This is in general agreement with heme modification studies in which the aryl group of aryl-heme iron complexes predominantly modifies the D ring of CYP2E1 (44Swanson B.A. Dutton D.R. Lunetta J.M.

To study the protective effects of red wine, experiments recently were executed in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. These studies showed that a commercially available grape seed polyphenolic extract, MegaNatural-AZ (MN), significantly attenuated AD-type cognitive deterioration and reduced cerebral amyloid deposition (Wang, J., Ho, L., Zhao, W., Ono, K., Rosensweig, C., Chen, L., Humala, N., Teplow, D. B., and Pasinetti, G. M. (2008) J. Neurosci. 28, 6388–6392). To elucidate the mechanistic bases for these observations, here we used CD spectroscopy, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins, thioflavin T fluorescence, size exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy to examine the effects of MN on the assembly of the two predominant disease-related amyloid β-protein alloforms, Aβ40 and Aβ42. We also examined the effects of MN on Aβ-induced cytotoxicity by assaying 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide metabolism and lactate dehydrogenase activity in Aβ-treated, differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Initial studies revealed that MN blocked Aβ fibril formation. Subsequent evaluation of the assembly stage specificity of the effect showed that MN was able to inhibit protofibril formation, pre-protofibrillar oligomerization, and initial coil → α-helix/β-sheet secondary structure transitions. Importantly, MN had protective effects in assays of cytotoxicity in which MN was mixed with Aβ prior to peptide assembly or following assembly and just prior to peptide addition to cells. These data suggest that MN is worthy of consideration as a therapeutic agent for AD.

Amyloid. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Continuing investigations of the pathogenetic relationships among tau, Aβ, and AD suggest that oligomeric forms of Aβ play a seminal role in disease causation (2Klein W.L. Stine Jr., W.B. Teplow D.B.

Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). If so, the most efficacious therapeutic agents would target the assembly or neurotoxic activity of these structures. This suggestion is consistent with the fact that current AD treatments, which block brain acetylcholine degradation or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, are not preventive or curative and produce only modest and temporary symptomatic effects (7Cummings J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Nature itself already may have created useful therapeutic agents. This suggestion comes in part from the search for answers to the “French paradox,” namely that consumption of relatively large amounts of cholesterol and saturated fats occurs in the presence of decreased coronary artery disease death rates (8Ferrieres J. Heart (Lond.). 2004; 90: 107-111Google Scholar). Investigation of this phenomenon revealed that moderate red wine consumption might be the answer (9Renaud S. de Lorgeril M. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1523-1526Abstract PubMed Scopus (3183) Google Scholar). The relevance of this finding to AD has come from subsequent French and Danish epidemiological studies suggesting that moderate wine drinking may protect against this disease (10Letenneur L. Dartigues J.F. Orgogozo J.M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 118: 317-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Dorozynski A. BMJ. 1997; 314: 997PubMed Google Scholar, 12Orgogozo J.M. Dartigues J.F.

Initial studies in transgenic animals of the effects of moderate consumption of red wines revealed a diminution in AD-like neuropathology and cognitive deterioration (14Wang J. Ho L. Zhao Z. Seror I.

Alzheimer's Dis., in pressGoogle Scholar). Recently, to establish a system enabling determination of the mechanistic basis for these epidemiologic observations, a grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) was administered orally to Tg2576 mice, a murine model of AD (16Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F.S. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Significant amelioration of cognitive deficits was observed, and this amelioration correlated with reductions in the amounts of high molecular weight Aβ assemblies in the brain (17Wang J. Ho L. Zhao W. Ono K. Rosensweig C. Chen L. Humala N. Teplow D.B. Pasinetti G.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). These studies support the postulation that grapes or their fermentation products contain compounds that could be useful therapeutic agents for AD. What are these compounds? Classical biochemical fractionation studies have shown that the active components of red wine are polyphenols, including resveratrol and the proanthocyanidins (18Flamini R. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 218-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Resveratrol was found to lower significantly the levels of secreted and intracellular Aβ produced in a variety of cell lines by increasing proteasome-mediated Aβ degradation (19Marambaud P. Zhao H. Davies P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37377-37382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a related polyphenolic compound, curcumin, is found in the common spice curry (20Sharma R.A. Gescher A.J. Steward W.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 1955-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). As with red wine, epidemiologic studies have shown a correlation between curcumin (curry) consumption and decreased AD risk (21Ganguli M. Chandra V. Kamboh M.I. Johnston J.M. Dodge H.H. Thelma B.K. Juyal R.C. Pandav R. Belle S.H. DeKosky S.T. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761®, another polyphenol-containing preparation, has been reported to improve cognitive performance of AD patients (22Le Bars P.L. Velasco F.M. Ferguson J.M. Dessain E.C. Kieser M. Hoerr R. Neuropsychobiology. 2002; 45: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The concordance of results from these different systems emphasizes the potential importance of elucidating the mechanism through which polyphenols alter Aβ aggregation and toxicity. Initial mechanistic studies have focused on formation of large oligomers and fibrils. Wine-related polyphenols isolated by high performance liquid chromatography have been shown to inhibit the formation of Aβ fibrils as well as to dissociate preformed fibrils by preferentially and reversibly binding to these structures (23Ono K.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1888-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For example, tannic acid, myricetin, morin, and quercetin inhibited fibril formation by >70% (23Ono K. Yoshiike Y. Takashima A. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Yamada M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 24Ono K. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Yamada M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Most recently, a commercially available GSPE, MegaNatural-AZ (MN), was shown to inhibit significantly the aggregation of Aβ into SDS-stable high molecular weight oligomers (17Wang J. Ho L. Zhao W. Ono K. Rosensweig C. Chen L. Humala N. Teplow D.B. Pasinetti G.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we sought to determine how polyphenols affected Aβ conformational dynamics and assembly and whether these effects correlated with peptide cytotoxicity. To do so, we treated Aβ42 and Aβ40 with MN and then monitored assembly and toxicity using a combination of CD, PICUP, ThT binding, electron microscopy (EM), MTT metabolism, and LDH activity. The results show potent inhibitory effects at all stages of peptide assembly. Chemicals and Reagents—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and were of the highest purity available. NGA9–119 (NGA) was obtained from Aurora Fine Chemicals Ltd., Graz, Austria. MegaNatural-AZ (MN) was obtained from Polyphenolics, Madera, CA. The molecular weight of catechin/epicatechin dimer, 580.6, the most abundant form of oligomer in GSPE, was used to calculate the molarity of MN. Water was produced using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Peptides and Proteins—Aβ peptides were synthesized, purified, and characterized as described previously (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthesis was performed on an automated peptide synthesizer (model 433A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-based methods on preloaded Wang resins. Peptides were purified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Quantitative amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry yielded the expected compositions and molecular weights, respectively, for each peptide. Purified peptides were stored as lyophilizates at −20 °C. A stock solution of glutathione S-transferase (GST; Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared by dissolving the lyophilizate to a concentration of 250 μm in 60 mm NaOH. Prior to use, aliquots were diluted 10-fold into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Preparation of Aβ Solutions—Aggregate-free solutions of Aβ were prepared using SEC (for a review, see Teplow (27Teplow D.B. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)). The nominal monomer fraction has been termed low molecular weight (LMW) Aβ because, at experimental peptide concentrations, this fraction comprises a mixture of monomer and low molecular oligomers in rapid equilibrium (28Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). For economy of presentation, we refer here to LMW Aβ simply as “Aβ.” To prepare Aβ, 200 μl of a 2 mg/ml peptide solution in dimethyl sulfoxide was sonicated for 1 min using a bath sonicator (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The resulting supernate was fractionated on a Superdex 75 HR column using 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The middle of the LMW peak was collected during 50 s and used immediately. A 10-μl aliquot was taken for amino acid analysis to determine quantitatively the peptide concentration in each preparation. Typically, the concentrations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were 30–40 and 10–20 μm, respectively. Peptide Aggregation—Aβ solutions were prepared as specified above, and then 0.5-ml aliquots were placed in 1-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Test compounds were dissolved in ethanol to a final concentration of 2.5 mm and then diluted with 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, to produce concentrations of 10 and 50 μm. One-half ml of each compound then was added to separate tubes of Aβ, yielding final peptide concentrations of ∼20 (Aβ40) and ∼10 μm (Aβ42) and final inhibitor concentrations of 5 and 25 μm. Compound:peptide ratios thus were ∼1:4 (Aβ40) and ∼1:2 (Aβ42) at the lower compound concentration and 5:4 (Aβ40) and 5:2 (Aβ42) at the higher compound concentration. Control tubes with peptide alone received 0.5 ml of buffer. Control tubes with compound alone received 0.5 ml each of compound and buffer. The measured pH in all tubes was identical, 7.4, within experimental error. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 0–10 days without agitation. We note that for each sample at each time point analyzed, aliquots used for different experiments (see below) generally all came from the same tube of Aβ, ensuring that valid correlations could be made among the data thus produced. ThT Fluorescence—Ten μl of sample was added to 190 μl of ThT dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and then the mixture was vortexed briefly. Fluorescence was determined three times at intervals of 10 s using an Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 450 and 482 nm, respectively. Sample fluorescence was determined by averaging the three readings and subtracting the fluorescence of a ThT blank. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of Aβ:compound mixtures were acquired immediately after sample preparation or following 2, 3, 6, or 7 days of incubation. CD measurements were made by removing a 200-μl aliquot from the reaction mixture, adding the aliquot to a 1-mm path length CD cuvette (Hellma, Forest Hills, NY), and acquiring spectra in a J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The CD cuvettes were maintained on ice prior to introduction into the spectrometer. Following temperature equilibration, spectra were recorded at 22 °C from ∼190–260 nm at 0.2 nm resolution with a scan rate of 100 nm/min. Ten scans were acquired and averaged for each sample. Raw data were manipulated by smoothing and subtraction of buffer spectra according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protofibril Formation—To study protofibril formation and the effects of compounds on it, Aβ was incubated according to the aggregation protocol above. Periodically during the 10-day incubation period, solutions were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and then 200 μl of the supernate was fractionated by SEC at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to a Waters 515 HPLC pump and a Waters 486 UV absorbance detector (Waters, Milford, MA), essentially as described (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Protofibrils were detected and recovered at an elution time of ∼12 min by UV absorbance at 254 nm. Electron Microscopy—A 10-μl aliquot of each sample was spotted onto a glow-discharged, carbon-coated Formvar grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and incubated for 20 min. The droplet then was displaced with an equal volume of 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in water and incubated for an additional 5 min. Finally, the peptide was stained with 8 μl of 1% (v/v) filtered (0.2 μm) uranyl acetate in water (Electron Microscopy Sciences). This solution was wicked off, and then the grid was air-dried. Samples were examined using a JEOL CX100 transmission electron microscopy. Chemical Cross-linking and Determination of Oligomer Frequency Distributions—Immediately after their preparation, samples were cross-linked using PICUP, as described (29Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Briefly, to 18 μl of protein solution were added 1 μl of 1 mm tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)) and 1 μl of 20 mm ammonium persulfate. The final protein: Ru(bpy):ammonium persulfate molar ratios of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were 0.29:1:20 and 0.16:1:20, respectively. The mixture was irradiated for 1 s with visible light, and then the reaction was quenched with 10 μl of Tricine sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Determination of the frequency distribution of monomers and oligomers was accomplished using SDS-PAGE and silver staining, as described (29Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of each cross-linked sample was electrophoresed on a 10–20% gradient Tricine gel and visualized by silver staining (SilverXpress, Invitrogen). Non-cross-linked samples were used as controls in each experiment. To produce intensity profiles and calculate the relative amounts of each oligomer type, densitometry was performed, and One-Dscan software (v. 2.2.2; BD Biosciences Bioimaging) was used to determine peak areas of baseline corrected data. In some experiments, the molar amounts of Ru(bpy) and ammonium persulfate were increased, relative to peptide, by factors of 2, 5, 10, and 20. Cell Culture—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (product number 430641, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in F-12K medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA) containing 15% (v/v) horse serum, 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 25 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. To prepare cells for assay, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once gently with F-12K medium containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml amphotericin B. A cell suspension then was prepared by the addition of this latter medium, but containing 100 μg/ml nerve growth factor (Invitrogen), followed by agitation of the flask. Cell concentration was determined using trypan blue staining, after which cells were plated at a density of 30,000 cells/well (90 μl total volume/well) in 96-well assay plates (Costar product number 3610, Corning Inc.). The nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of the cells was allowed to proceed for 48 h, at which point toxicity assays were done. Cytotoxicity Assays—Toxicity was assessed in two ways. Peptides were preincubated with either 0 μm or 25 μm test compound in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 0, 2, 3, or 7 days prior to the addition of a 10-μl aliquot of the peptide: compound mixture to the differentiated PC12 cells. Alternatively, Aβ was incubated as described above but in the absence of compound. In this case, the peptide solutions were mixed with 0 or 25 μm test compound immediately before addition to cells. Cell were treated for 24 h with a final concentration of 0 or ∼2 μm Aβ alone or with Aβ plus 2.5 μm compound. Peptide: compound ratios of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were 0.72 and 0.39, respectively. In practice, the “zero time” samples for each alternative experimental procedure were equivalent, as all components were mixed with cells at the same time. To determine toxicity, 15 μl of MTT solution (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well of the microtiter plate, and the plate was incubated in the CO2 incubator for an additional 3.5 h. The cells then were lysed by the addition of 100 μl of solubilization solution (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by overnight incubation. MTT reduction was assessed by measuring absorption at 570 nm (corrected for background absorbance at 630 nm) using a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Controls included medium with sodium phosphate (“negative”), fibrils (“positive”), and 1 μm staurosporine (“maximal positive”). Fibrillar Aβ40 and Aβ42 were added to cells at final concentrations of 10 and 5 μm, respectively. The same fibril preparations were used for all experiments and served to control interassay variability. To enable interassay comparisons, toxicity within each experiment was determined first. Six replicates were done for each treatment group, and the data from three independent experiments were combined and reported as mean ± S.E. percentage of toxicity T=((AAβ−Amedium)/(Astaurosporine−Amedium))×100 (Eq. 1) where AAβ, Amedium, and Astaurosporine were absorbance values from Aβ-containing samples, medium alone, or staurosporine alone, respectively. LDH activity was determined using the Promega (Madison, WI) CytoTox-ONE homogeneous membrane integrity assay. To do so, peptide and peptide: compound solutions prepared as described above were incubated with the cells for 48 h. One hundred μl of LDH reagent then was added to each well, and the plate was incubated in the dark for 10 min, after which 50 μl of stop solution was added and the fluorescence was measured using the BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader with excitation wavelength of 560 nm and emission wavelength of 590 nm. Controls included medium with sodium phosphate (negative), fibrils (positive), and lysis solution (maximal positive). Fibrillar Aβ40 and Aβ42 were added to cells at final concentrations of 10 and 5 μm, respectively. Six replicates were done for each treatment group, and the data from four independent experiments were combined and reported as mean ± S.E. The percentage of toxicity was calculated according to the formula above, except that the term Astaurosporine was replaced with Alysis. Statistical Analysis—One-way factorial analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were used to determine statistical significance among data sets. These tests were implemented within GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0a, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Recent studies of neurological function, amyloid deposition, and peptide aggregation in the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD have shown that red wine (15Ho, L., Chen, L. H., Wang, J., Zhao, W., Talcott, S. T., Ono, K., Teplow, D. B., Humala, N., Cheng, A., Percival, S. S., Ferruzzi, M., Janle, E., Dickstein, D., and Pasinetti, G. (2008) J. Alzheimer's Dis., in pressGoogle Scholar), and the GSPE MN (Fig. 1) (17Wang J. Ho L. Zhao W. Ono K. Rosensweig C. Chen L. Humala N. Teplow D.B. Pasinetti G.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6388-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), inhibit formation of high molecular weight SDS-stable Aβ aggregates, amyloid deposition, and Aβ-induced neuronal dysfunction. In the following sections, we present results of studies designed to elucidate the mechanistic bases for these inhibitory effects. ThT Binding—Our first question was whether fibril formation was affected by MN. To answer this question, we used ThT to monitor temporal changes in β-sheet content in samples of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the absence or presence of MN. ThT fluorescence is not a measure of fibril content per se, but because β-sheet formation correlates with fibril formation, ThT fluorescence is a useful surrogate marker (30LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 31LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 32Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Investig. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). The ThT studies also allowed us to determine the kinetics of peptide assembly, providing information on nucleation and elongation phases of Aβ assembly. In these and subsequent experiments, we include a medium alone control as well as a control comprising medium containing the compound NGA9–119 (Fig. 1). We include NGA here as a negative control because, like MN, it is a polycyclic compound and thus is more representative of the composition of the MN solution than is medium alone. However, unlike MN, NGA has shown no activity in prior assays of Aβ assembly. In the absence of compounds, Aβ40 displayed a quasisigmoidal binding curve characterized by an ∼2-day lag time, an ∼3-day period of successively increasing ThT binding, and a binding plateau occurring after ∼5 days (Fig. 2), results consistent with the well known nucleation-dependent polymerization model of Aβ assembly (33Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). When Aβ40 was incubated with NGA, at a compound:peptide ratio of either 1:4 or 5:4, the binding curves were identical to that of the untreated peptide, within experimental error (Fig. 2A). In contrast, significant effects were produced by MN (Fig. 2C). These included MN concentration-dependent increases in lag time, decreases in β-sheet growth rates, and decreased final β-sheet levels (Table 1). Almost complete inhibition of Aβ40 assembly was observed using the higher (25 μm) MN concentration.TABLE 1Kinetics of Aβ assemblySampleLag timeaLag time was defined as the point of intersection with the abscissa of the line determined by the pseudo-linear portion of the fluorescence progress curve, according to Evans et al.

Open table in a new tab As with Aβ40, untreated Aβ42 and both NGA-treated samples assembled identically, within experimental error (Fig. 2B). Within the time resolution of the assay, little or no lag was observed in the development of fluorescence, which increased in a quasilinear manner for 4 days and then remained constant. When Aβ42 was incubated with MN at a compound:peptide ratio of 1:2, a 1-day lag was observed, and maximal ThT binding, which occurred 1 day later, was 6-fold lower that of the untreated peptide (Fig. 2D; Table 1). However, at a compound:peptide ratio of 5:2, no β-sheet formation was observed. MN thus inhibited β-sheet formation by both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in a concentration-dependent manner. Aβ Assembly Morphology—EM was used to determine the morphologies of the Aβ40 and Aβ42 assemblies when maximal ThT binding was observed. Classical amyloid fibrils were observed in samples of untreated Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 3, A and B, res"
https://openalex.org/W2050598200,"To facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis of glycosaminoglycans, we tagged the reducing end of lyase-generated disaccharides with aniline-containing stable isotopes (12C6 and 13C6). Because different isotope tags have no effect on chromatographic retention times but can be discriminated by a mass detector, differentially isotope-tagged samples can be compared simultaneously by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and quantified by admixture with known amounts of standards. The technique is adaptable to all types of glycosaminoglycans, and its sensitivity is only limited by the type of mass spectrometer available. We validated the method using commercial heparin and keratan sulfate as well as heparan sulfate isolated from mutant and wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells, and select tissues from mutant and wild-type mice. This new method provides more robust, reliable, and sensitive means of quantitative evaluation of glycosaminoglycan disaccharide compositions than existing techniques allowing us to compare the chondroitin and heparan sulfate compositions of Hydra vulgaris, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate significant differences in glycosaminoglycan structure among these organisms that might represent evolutionarily distinct functional motifs.

Metazoans make several types of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GRIL, glycan reductive isotope labeling; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; HS, heparan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; DS, dermatan sulfate; DSC, disaccharide structure code; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Hs2st, uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase; GlcA, d-glucuronic acid; GlcNS, N-sulfo-d-glucosamine; GlcNH2, N-unsubstituted d-glucosamine; XIC, extracted ion current; DBA, dibutylamine; dp, degree of polymerization. 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GRIL, glycan reductive isotope labeling; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; CID, collision-induced dissociation; HS, heparan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; DS, dermatan sulfate; DSC, disaccharide structure code; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Hs2st, uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase; GlcA, d-glucuronic acid; GlcNS, N-sulfo-d-glucosamine; GlcNH2, N-unsubstituted d-glucosamine; XIC, extracted ion current; DBA, dibutylamine; dp, degree of polymerization. including keratan sulfate (KS), chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), and heparan sulfate/heparin (HS). Each type of chain consists of unique disaccharide units. KS consists of galactose (Gal) and GlcNAc ([Galβ1, 4GlcNAcβ1,3]n) with variable sulfation at C6 of either sugar. CS/DS assembles as a copolymer of GlcAβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4 and then undergoes various processing reactions, including C5 epimerization of a portion of GlcA units to iduronic acid in DS, O-sulfation at C2 and more rarely at C3 of the uronic acids, and O-sulfation at C4 and C6 of the GalNAc residues (1Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Khoo K.H. Sugiura M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11063-11074Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HS is the most highly modified GAG, consisting initially of GlcAβ1,4GlcNAcα1,4 units, which then undergo variable processing by GlcNAc N-deacetylation and N-sulfation, C5 epimerization of some GlcA units to iduronic acid, and O-sulfate addition to C2 of the uronic acids and C6 and more rarely at C3 of the glucosamine units (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). The arrangement of the modified residues along the chain creates binding sites for numerous growth factors, enzymes, and extracellular matrix proteins. The structural variation that can occur makes sulfated GAG chains one of the most complex classes of macromolecules found in nature. GAG fine structure is typically assessed by analyzing the disaccharide composition of an isolated mixture of chains. A number of techniques have been developed to accomplish this task that rely on chemical or enzymatic depolymerization of the chains into their constituent disaccharides, followed by separation via anion exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography with ion pairing agents, or capillary electrophoresis. These techniques separate disaccharides based on charge, position of sulfate groups, and uronic acid composition. The individual disaccharide residues are detected using different methods, such as metabolic radiolabeling of chains prior to isolation, radiochemical labeling of liberated disaccharides by borotritide reduction, UV absorbance of enzymatically generated products, or fluorescence of fluorophore-tagged derivatives. These techniques have a limit of sensitivity of ∼10-11 mol (∼10 ng). The actual identification of the disaccharides depends on determining the retention time relative to authentic standards, which are sometimes difficult to procure. At times the profile can be confusing due to spurious peaks or contaminants (3Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol.

The technology affords simultaneous measurement of chromatographic retention time, absolute mass, ion adduction characteristics, and fragment ion analysis of each disaccharide, eliminating the need for comparison to disaccharide standards. In addition to revealing more structural and chemical information for each disaccharide, the use of LC/MS eliminates the need for radiolabeling or the requirement for UV or fluorescent derivatization. Furthermore, depending on mass detector design, LC/MS can be significantly more sensitive (∼10-15 mol, or ∼1 pg). Although the use of LC/MS has greatly enhanced disaccharide analysis, the technology suffers in one important aspect: the technique is semiquantitative due to variation in the ionization efficiency of different disaccharides, solvent effects on ionization, and suppression by contaminants in the preparation. To circumvent these problems, LC/MS procedures have been developed that utilize linear equations to correlate the concentration of underivatized disaccharides with the detection of molecular standards (10Saad O.M.

Here we describe a mass-tagging technique that allows quantitative analysis of disaccharide composition and ratiometric comparisons between samples. This method employs glycan reductive isotope labeling (GRIL) with [12C6]- and [13C6]aniline 3B. Xia, C. L. Feasley, G. P. Sachdev, D. F. Smith, and R. D. Cummings, submitted for publication. 3B.

Cummings, submitted for publication., modification of N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues by propionylation and resolution of the derivatives by LC/MS (GRIL-LC/MS). In this study, we demonstrate the reliability and sensitivity of this new method compared with the most commonly used means of GAG compositional analysis based on post column fluorescence derivatization. Improving LC/MS analysis in this way revealed that heparan sulfates from the invertebrates Drosophila melanogaster and Hydra vulgaris have a high content of free-amine-containing disaccharides compared with samples obtained from Chinese hamster ovary cells, mice, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Culture Conditions—Wild-type and mutant pgsF17 cells (26Bai X.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Mice were housed in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-approved vivaria in the School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, following standards and procedures approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for the ethical use of animals in experiments. A line bearing a conditional loxP-flanked allele of uronyl-2-O-sulfotransferase (Hs2st) was bred to ZP3Cre to generate heterozygous mice. 4O. Garner, B. E. Crawford, J. Castagnola, D. Song, R. Lawrence, J. R. Brown, J. R. Bishop, D. Y. Zhang, L. Wang, and J. D. Esko, unpublished results. These were then in-bred to produce homozygous null, heterozygous, and wild-type littermate embryos. Another set of mice was crossbred with AlbCre mice to generate a hepatocyte-specific mutant. Embryos and tissues were genotyped by PCR. H. vulgaris (Zurich strain), D. melanogaster, and C. elegans were grown according to established procedures. Purification and Enzymatic Depolymerization of HS and CS Chains—GAG chains were extracted from cell monolayers, liver, or homogenized whole mouse embryos by exhaustive digestion with Pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 24 h followed by anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephacel, GE Healthcare). After loading the columns, they were washed with 0.25 m NaCl, and GAGs were eluted with 1 m NaCl (27Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAGs from H. vulgaris, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans were prepared in a similar way except that the samples were first delipidated with acetone (3Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) before Pronase digestion and subsequent anion-exchange chromatography. All preparations were desalted by gel filtration (PD-10, GE Healthcare). GAGs were digested with 1 milliunit each of heparin lyases I, II, and III (Seikagaku, Tokyo) for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of buffer containing 40 mm ammonium acetate and 3.3 mm calcium acetate, pH 7, or for 3 h at 37 °C with 25 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku, Tokyo) in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0 (28Linhardt R.J. Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1986; 12: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Bovine Corneal KS (Sigma-Aldrich) was digested with either 100 milliunits of keratanase (Seikagaku, Tokyo) or 5 milliunits of keratanase II (Seikagaku, Tokyo) per 20 μg of GAG in 50 μl of buffer containing 7.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, for 16 h at 37 °C. The extent of conversion was complete based on analysis of standard GAGs incubated under the same conditions. Disaccharide Standards and Purification of 3-O-Sulfated Disaccharides—HS disaccharides D0A6, D2A0, and D2A6 5Throughout this report we use a shorthand nomenclature called “disaccharide structure code (DSC)” to simplify the description of glycosaminoglycan disaccharides. See Lawrence et al. (25Lawrence R. Lu H. Rosenberg R.D. Esko J.D. Zhang L. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) for details and Table 1. were purchased from Calbiochem, whereas all other HS disaccharide standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CS disaccharides were obtained from Oxford Glycosystems. Stock solutions (1 mm) were prepared by dissolution of each disaccharide in water. The final concentration was verified by quantitating the amount of uronic acid present using high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (29Manzi A.E. Norgard-Sumnicht K. Argade S. Marth J.D. Van Halbeek H. Varki A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 669-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 3-O-sulfated disaccharides were isolated from a stable CHO cell line CHO[ECO] containing a retroviral expression construct for the human 3-OST-3A cDNA (12Lawrence R. Kuberan B. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HS isolated from these transductants was subjected to exhaustive digestion with heparan lyases as described above, and the disaccharides corresponding to D2S3 and D2S9 were collected (12Lawrence R. Kuberan B. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Purity and identity was checked by LC/MS. Reductive Amination and Acylation of Disaccharides—1 pmol to 10 nmol of HS and CS disaccharides was transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and dried down in a centrifugal evaporator. [12C6]Aniline or [13C6]aniline (15 μl, 165 μmol) and 15 μl of 1 m NaCNBH3 (Sigma-Aldrich) freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide:acetic acid (7:3, v/v) were added to each sample. Reactions were carried out at 65 °C for 4 h or alternatively at 37 °C for 16 h and then dried in a centrifugal evaporator. In most cases subsequent purification steps are not necessary. However, if samples contain excessive contaminants, non-glycan components can be removed using paper chromatography cartridges (GlycoClean S cartridges, Prozyme) according to the manufacturer's instructions without loss of aniline-tagged disaccharides (as judged by LC/MS analysis of flow through and wash fractions). Unsubstituted amines were reacted with propionic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich). Dried samples were reconstituted in 20 μl of 50% methanol and 3 μl of propionic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 23.3 μmol) was added. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 2 h. Acylated disaccharides were subsequently aniline-tagged as described above. LC/MS Analysis of HS and CS Disaccharides and KS Digestion Products—An LCQ classic quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source, and a quaternary high-performance liquid chromatography pump (Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA) was used for disaccharide analyses. Derivatized and non-derivatized disaccharide residues were separated on a C18 reversed-phase column (0.46 × 25 cm, Vydac) with the ion pairing agent dibutylamine (DBA, Sigma-Aldrich) (9Kuberan B.

The isocratic steps were: 100% buffer A (8 mm acetic acid, 5 mm DBA) for 10 min, 17% buffer B (70% methanol, 8 mm acetic acid, 5 mm DBA) for 15 min; 32% buffer B for 15 min, 40% buffer B for 15 min, 60% buffer B for 15 min; 100% buffer B for 10 min; and 100% buffer A for 10 min. The most highly substituted disaccharide, D2S9 (see Table 1), eluted at 60% buffer B (42% methanol). Ions of interest were monitored in negative ion mode, and signal intensity was optimized for a representative species (D2S0, see Table 1). To minimize in-source fragmentation of sulfated disaccharides, the capillary temperature and spray voltage were kept at 140 °C and 4.75 kV, respectively. The accumulative extracted ion current (XIC) was computed, and further data analysis was carried out as described in the documentation for the Qual Browser software provided by Thermo-Finnigan. For CID analysis of CS-monosulfated disaccharides, ions with m/z 535 were selected using a 2-atomic mass unit window and activated with 30% normalized collision energy.TABLE 1Molecular masses for component disaccharides from HS, CS/DS, and KS used in generating disaccharide XIC traces for both quantitative and qualitative compositional analysisDSCStructureObserved m/zNon-derivatized[12C6]Aniline-derivatized[12C6]Aniline-derivatizedPA/aniline[M-H]−1[M-H]−1[M-2H+DBA]−1[M-H]−1HS disaccharidesD0H0ΔUA-GlcNH2336413469D0H6ΔUA-GlcNH2-6S416493549D2H0ΔUA2S-GlcNH2416493549D2H6ΔUA2S-GlcNH26S496573629D0A0ΔUA-GlcNAc378455D0A6ΔUA-GlcNAc6S458535D2A0ΔUA2S-GlcNAc458535D2A6ΔUA2S-GlcNAc6S538615744D0S0ΔUA-GlcNS416493D0S6ΔUA-GlcNS6S496573702D0S3ΔUA-GlcNS3S496573702D2S0ΔUA2S-GlcNS496573702D2S6ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S576653782D2S3ΔUA2S-GlcNS3S576653782D0S9ΔUA-GlcNS3S6S576653782D2S9ΔUA2S-GlcNS3S6S656733862CS disaccharidesD0a0ΔUA-GalNAc378455D0a4ΔUA-GalNAc4S458535D2a0ΔUA2S-GalNAc458535D0a6ΔUA-GalNAc6S458535D2a4ΔUA2S-GalNAc4S538615744D2a6ΔUA2S-GalNAc6S538615744D0a10ΔUA-GalNAc4S6S538615744D2a10ΔUA2S-GalNAc4S6S618695824KS disaccharidesg0A6Gal-GlcNAc6S462539g6A6Gal6S-GlcNAc6S542619748A6g0GlcNAc6S-Gal462539 Open table in a new tab Heparin (Sigma) disaccharides were also separated by high-performance liquid chromatography on a ProPac PA1 anion-exchange column (Dionex) with a linear gradient of sodium chloride (50 mm to 1 m, pH 3.5, 60 min). Post column derivatization with 2-cyanoacetamide was performed as described (31Toyoda H. Nagashima T. Hirata R. Toida T. Imanari T. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 704: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fluorescent products were detected with a flow-through fluorescence detector (Jasco) set at excitation 346 nm and emission 410 nm. Stable Isotope Labeling and LC/MS Analysis of Glycosaminoglycan Disaccharides—Of the different technologies available to analyze the disaccharide composition of GAG chains, LC/MS is most robust because of its higher sensitivity and its capacity for multiparametric analysis. However, due to intrinsic molecular differences in structure and extrinsic effects of solvent and contaminants on ionization, traditional LC/MS is not quantitative. To overcome the non-quantitative aspects of LC/MS, we adapted the GRIL technique. 3B. Xia, C. L. Feasley, G. P. Sachdev, D. F. Smith, and R. D. Cummings, submitted for publication. As applied to glycosaminoglycans, the technique first involves enzymatic depolymerization of partially purified chains using bacterial hydrolases or eliminases, followed by reductive amination of the reducing ends of the disaccharides with aniline to form a secondary amine derivative (Fig. 1A). The conjugation reaction is rapid and quantitative. Incubation of standard disaccharides derived from heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate with a 100-fold molar excess of [12C6]aniline at 65 °C yielded >98% derivatization in 4 h, which was determined by measuring unmodified disaccharide present in the reaction mixture. No detectable O-desulfation byproducts and only a trace amount of N-deacetylated or N-desulfated byproducts were detected under these conditions. Less than 2% of these byproducts were observed after incubation at 65 °C for 4 h (supplemental Fig. S1). Reducing the temperature to 37 °C (for 16 h) almost completely eliminated these minor byproducts, without sacrificing the efficiency of conjugation (>98%). We utilized a Finnigan LCQ Classic quadrupole mass spectrometer during the development phase of this method, which is capable of moderate levels of sensitivity. Based on titration studies, the limit of sensitivity was 1 pmol/disaccharide. Because of multiparametric analysis, detection was reliable for disaccharides present at low levels in samples containing significant background contaminants that tend to obscure the disaccharide profile obtained by UV or fluorescence detection. Furthermore, all species present in the sample, including underivatized disaccharides, can be detected, so that the extent of derivatization can be internally monitored. The linear range of GRIL-LC/MS was evaluated by measuring the XIC ratio between increasing amounts of the disulfated disaccharide standard D2S0 (Table 1) tagged with [12C6]aniline and a set amount (25 pmol) of D2S0 tagged with [13C6]aniline. Three replicate measurements were carried out with each concentration of [12C6]aniline-tagged D2S0 and showed the linear range to be from 1 pmol to >2500 pmol (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed in titration assays for other purified disaccharide standards (data not shown). The standard curve deviated somewhat from linearity below 1 pmol, but this lower limit reflects the mass spectrometer configuration. At least 100-fold greater sensitivity should be achievable on a more modern instrument (e.g. a linear ion trap or quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer). Aniline Derivatization Enhances Detection and Resolution of HS and CS Disaccharides—Derivatization of disaccharides with aniline led to enhanced resolution by liquid chromatography and greater sensitivity of detection by mass spectrometry. For example, the isobaric disaccharides designated D0S6 and D2S0 in their underivatized states did not separate by reversed-phase chromatography on C18 resin (Fig. 2A), whereas the aniline derivatives completely resolved from each other (Fig. 2B). Higher sensitivity was also observed for the aniline derivatives presumably due to greater desolvation at the ion source of conjugated disaccharides, which eluted at a higher concentration of methanol (notice the increase in peak height of D2H6 and D2S6 in Fig. 2B compared with Fig. 2A). The extracted ion current (XIC) for m/z corresponding to the underivatized forms of D0S6 and D2S0 showed the presence of the free molecular ions (m/z = 496.1 [M-H]-1), adduction ions formed with the ion pairing reagent (DBA) (m/z = 625.1 [M-2H+DBA]-1), and a small amount of desulfated species (m/z = 416.1 [M-H-SO3]-1) caused by in-source fragmentation (Fig. 2C), but the relative contribution of each disaccharide to the XIC could not be determined. However, the separated aniline derivatives had mass spectra that differed significantly (Fig. 2D). The aniline derivative of D0S6 formed DBA adducts more readily than the derivative of D2S0 and underwent partial in-source desulfation to a greater extent, which presumably reflects structural differences between these isobaric disaccharides. To determine if all of the disaccharides typically found in naturally occurring HS chains can be separated and quantitated by GRIL-LC/MS, mixtures of equimolar amounts of disaccharide standards were analyzed (Fig. 3A). Peak assignments were made by comparing the retention times and mass spectra to individual aniline-tagged standards (Table 1). The results showed that all of the HS disaccharide standards resolved with the exception of the trisulfated disaccharides D2S3 and D2S6, which co-elute. In all tissues analyzed to date, D2S3 is either absent or exists in very low amounts compared with D2S6 (12Lawrence R. Kuberan B. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, its contribution to the combined peak can usually be considered negligible. If necessary, the presence of D2S3 can be determined by analyzing the disaccharides in their underivatized states in which they are fully resolved by conventional LC/MS (12Lawrence R. Kuberan B. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GRIL-LC/MS can detect the 3-O-sulfated disaccharides D2S3 and D2S9, which were prepared from CHO cells transduced with human Hs3st-3a (12Lawrence R. Kuberan B. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two other disaccharide containing 3-O-sulfated glucosamine units (D0S3, D0S9) are not yet available for analysis. Other relatively rare disaccharides containing unsubstituted amino groups (D0H6, D2H0, and D2H6) were also resolved. All disaccharides derived from CS by chondroitinase ABC digestion also resolved, with the exception of the two monosulfated isomers D0a4 and D2a0 (Fig. 3B). The latter is a component of dermatan sulfate. As discussed below, collision-induced dissociation (CID) can be used to distinguish these isobaric species. This approach is not useful for discriminating the HS disaccharides D2S3 and D2S6, because desulfation predominates during ionic fragmentation of these more highly sulfated species. Qualitative Analysis of GAG Chain Structure Using GRIL-LC/MS—Corneal KS consists of variably sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine units, bearing sulfate groups at C6 of N-acetylglucosamine and galactose residues. The non-reducing end termini can also include sialic acid linked α2-3 to a penultimate galactose residue (Fig. 4A). To demonstrate the suitability of GRIL-LC/MS for analyzing KS oligosaccharides, a sample of bovine corneal KS was subjected to exhaustive digestion with either keratanase or keratanase II, which depolymerize the chains dependent on the sulfation of the N-acetylglucosamine and galactose subunits (Fig. 4A). The digestion products were then labeled with [12C6]aniline and analyzed by LC/MS. Keratanase cleaves between unsulfated galactose and 6-O-sulfated or unsulfated N-acetylglucosamine (Fig. 4A) resulting in the release of sequential A6g0 disaccharides and blocks of A6g6 oligosaccharides (Fig. 4B, upper panel). The results show that these KS I chains contain significant amounts of fully sulfated blocks up to the size of octamers, which are separated by one or more A6g0 disaccharides. Keratanase II cleaves between 6-O-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine and galactose with or without sulfation (Fig. 4A) resulting in the release of both g0A6 and g6A6 disaccharides (Fig. 4B, lower panel). In addition, small amounts of a number of tetrasaccharides and a single pentasaccharide were detected, consistent with previous studies (32Tai G.H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2005271761,"The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is emerging as an important mediator of immune and inflammatory responses. S1P formation is catalyzed by sphingosine kinase (SK), of which the SK1 isoenzyme is activated by tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha). SK1 has been shown to be required for mediating TNF-alpha inflammatory responses in cells, including induction of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). Because TNF-alpha and COX-2 are increased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we investigated the role of SK1 in a murine model of colitis. SK1(-/-) mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) had significantly less blood loss, weight loss, colon shortening, colon histological damage, and splenomegaly than did wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, SK1(-/-) mice had no systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, WT but not SK1(-/-) mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium had significant increases in blood S1P levels, colon SK1 message and activity, and colon neutrophilic infiltrate. Unlike WT mice, SK1(-/-) mice failed to show colonic COX-2 induction despite an exaggerated TNF-alpha response; thus implicating for the first time SK1 in TNF-alpha-mediated COX-2 induction in vivo. Inhibition of SK1 may prove to be a valuable therapeutic target by inhibiting systemic and local inflammation in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2123953466,"The mushroom body is an insect brain structure required for olfactory learning. Its principal neurons, the Kenyon cells (KCs), form a large cell population. The neuronal populations from which their olfactory input derives (olfactory sensory and projection neurons) can be identified individually by genetic, anatomical, and physiological criteria. We ask whether KCs are similarly identifiable individually, using genetic markers and whole-cell patch-clamp in vivo. We find that across-animal responses are as diverse within the genetically labeled subset as across all KCs in a larger sample. These results combined with those from a simple model, using projection neuron odor responses as inputs, suggest that the precise circuit specification seen at earlier stages of odor processing is likely absent among the mushroom body KCs."
https://openalex.org/W2139712782,"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark for transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in diverse organisms. Recent studies suggest that the methylation status of a number of genes is dynamically regulated by methylation and demethylation. In Arabidopsis, active DNA demethylation is mediated by the ROS1 (repressor of silencing 1) subfamily of 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases through a base excision repair pathway. These demethylases have critical roles in erasing DNA methylation and preventing TGS of target genes. However, it is not known how the demethylases are targeted to specific sequences. Here we report the identification of ROS3, an essential regulator of DNA demethylation that contains an RNA recognition motif. Analysis of ros3 mutants and ros1 ros3 double mutants suggests that ROS3 acts in the same genetic pathway as ROS1 to prevent DNA hypermethylation and TGS. Gel mobility shift assays and analysis of ROS3 immunoprecipitate from plant extracts shows that ROS3 binds to small RNAs in vitro and in vivo. Immunostaining shows that ROS3 and ROS1 proteins co-localize in discrete foci dispersed throughout the nucleus. These results demonstrate a critical role for ROS3 in preventing DNA hypermethylation and suggest that DNA demethylation by ROS1 may be guided by RNAs bound to ROS3."
https://openalex.org/W1964337118,"Species-specific chemosignals, pheromones, regulate social behaviors such as aggression, mating, pup-suckling, territory establishment, and dominance. The identity of these cues remains mostly undetermined and few mammalian pheromones have been identified. Genetically-encoded pheromones are expected to exhibit several different mechanisms for coding 1) diversity, to enable the signaling of multiple behaviors, 2) dynamic regulation, to indicate age and dominance, and 3) species-specificity. Recently, the major urinary proteins (Mups) have been shown to function themselves as genetically-encoded pheromones to regulate species-specific behavior. Mups are multiple highly related proteins expressed in combinatorial patterns that differ between individuals, gender, and age; which are sufficient to fulfill the first two criteria. We have now characterized and fully annotated the mouse Mup gene content in detail. This has enabled us to further analyze the extent of Mup coding diversity and determine their potential to encode species-specific cues.Our results show that the mouse Mup gene cluster is composed of two subgroups: an older, more divergent class of genes and pseudogenes, and a second class with high sequence identity formed by recent sequential duplications of a single gene/pseudogene pair. Previous work suggests that truncated Mup pseudogenes may encode a family of functional hexapeptides with the potential for pheromone activity. Sequence comparison, however, reveals that they have limited coding potential. Similar analyses of nine other completed genomes find Mup gene expansions in divergent lineages, including those of rat, horse and grey mouse lemur, occurring independently from a single ancestral Mup present in other placental mammals. Our findings illustrate that increasing genomic complexity of the Mup gene family is not evolutionarily isolated, but is instead a recurring mechanism of generating coding diversity consistent with a species-specific function in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1963628765,"The time course of the requirement for local protein synthesis in the stabilization of learning-related synaptic growth and the persistence of long-term memory was examined using Aplysia bifurcated sensory neuron-motor neuron cultures. We find that, following repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT), the local perfusion of emetine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or a TAT-AS oligonucleotide directed against ApCPEB blocks long-term facilitation (LTF) at either 24 or 48 hr and leads to a selective retraction of newly formed sensory neuron varicosities induced by 5-HT. By contrast, later inhibition of local protein synthesis, at 72 hr after 5-HT, has no effect on either synaptic growth or LTF. These results define a specific stabilization phase for the storage of long-term memory during which newly formed varicosities are labile and require sustained CPEB-dependent local protein synthesis to acquire the more stable properties of mature varicosities required for the persistence of LTF."
https://openalex.org/W1992122154,"The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause severe illness in humans and animals. Now the enzyme GILT (interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase) has been identified as a critical host factor for infection by L. monocytogenes. Once in the body Listeria produces a pore-forming toxin, listeriolysin O (LLO), that releases phagocytosed bacteria into the cytosol of macrophages where they can replicate. LLO needs to be reduced before it becomes active, and it is the host's GILT enzyme that mediates this reduction. Mice lacking GILT are resistant to Listeria. This work offers a new potential therapeutic target for a disease where antibiotic resistance is of growing concern. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, intracellular, food-borne pathogen that can cause severe illness in humans and animals. On infection, it is actively phagocytosed by macrophages1; it then escapes from the phagosome, replicates in the cytosol, and subsequently spreads from cell to cell by a non-lytic mechanism driven by actin polymerization2. Penetration of the phagosomal membrane is initiated by the secreted haemolysin listeriolysin O (LLO), which is essential for vacuolar escape in vitro and for virulence in animal models of infection3. Reduction is required to activate the lytic activity of LLO in vitro4,5,6, and we show here that reduction by the enzyme γ-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT, also called Ifi30) is responsible for the activation of LLO in vivo. GILT is a soluble thiol reductase expressed constitutively within the lysosomes of antigen-presenting cells7,8, and it accumulates in macrophage phagosomes as they mature into phagolysosomes9. The enzyme is delivered by a mannose-6-phosphate receptor-dependent mechanism to the endocytic pathway, where amino- and carboxy-terminal pro-peptides are cleaved to generate a 30-kDa mature enzyme7,8,10. The active site of GILT contains two cysteine residues in a CXXC motif that catalyses the reduction of disulphide bonds7,8. Mice lacking GILT are deficient in generating major histocompatibility complex class-II-restricted CD4+ T-cell responses to protein antigens that contain disulphide bonds11,12. Here we show that these mice are resistant to L. monocytogenes infection. Replication of the organism in GILT-negative macrophages, or macrophages expressing an enzymatically inactive GILT mutant, is impaired because of delayed escape from the phagosome. GILT activates LLO within the phagosome by the thiol reductase mechanism shared by members of the thioredoxin family. In addition, purified GILT activates recombinant LLO, facilitating membrane permeabilization and red blood cell lysis. The data show that GILT is a critical host factor that facilitates L. monocytogenes infection."
https://openalex.org/W2039071788,"Many immune signaling pathways require activation of the Syk tyrosine kinase to link ligation of surface receptors to changes in gene expression. Despite the central role of Syk in these pathways, the Syk activation process remains poorly understood. In this work we quantitatively characterized the molecular mechanism of Syk activation <i>in vitro</i> using a real time fluorescence kinase assay, mutagenesis, and other biochemical techniques. We found that dephosphorylated full-length Syk demonstrates a low initial rate of substrate phosphorylation that increases during the kinase reaction due to autophosphorylation. The initial rate of Syk activity was strongly increased by either pre-autophosphorylation or binding of phosphorylated immune tyrosine activation motif peptides, and each of these factors independently fully activated Syk. Deletion mutagenesis was used to identify regions of Syk important for regulation, and residues 340–356 of the SH2 kinase linker region were identified to be important for suppression of activity before activation. Comparison of the activation processes of Syk and Zap-70 revealed that Syk is more readily activated by autophosphorylation than Zap-70, although both kinases are rapidly activated by Src family kinases. We also studied Syk activity in B cell lysates and found endogenous Syk is also activated by phosphorylation and immune tyrosine activation motif binding. Together these experiments show that Syk functions as an ""OR-gate"" type of molecular switch. This mechanism of switch-like activation helps explain how Syk is both rapidly activated after receptor binding but also sustains activity over time to facilitate longer term changes in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2111975672,"Innate chemosensory preferences are often encoded by sensory neurons that are specialized for attractive or avoidance behaviors. Here, we show that one olfactory neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans, AWC(ON), has the potential to direct both attraction and repulsion. Attraction, the typical AWC(ON) behavior, requires a receptor-like guanylate cyclase GCY-28 that acts in adults and localizes to AWC(ON) axons. gcy-28 mutants avoid AWC(ON)-sensed odors; they have normal odor-evoked calcium responses in AWC(ON) but reversed turning biases in odor gradients. In addition to gcy-28, a diacylglycerol/protein kinase C pathway that regulates neurotransmission switches AWC(ON) odor preferences. A behavioral switch in AWC(ON) may be part of normal olfactory plasticity, as odor conditioning can induce odor avoidance in wild-type animals. Genetic interactions, acute rescue, and calcium imaging suggest that the behavioral reversal results from presynaptic changes in AWC(ON). These results suggest that alternative modes of neurotransmission can couple one sensory neuron to opposite behavioral outputs."
https://openalex.org/W2027788106,"In Drosophila embryos and larvae, a small number of identified motor neurons innervate body wall muscles in a highly stereotyped pattern. Although genetic screens have identified many proteins that are required for axon guidance and synaptogenesis in this system, little is known about the mechanisms by which muscle fibers are defined as targets for specific motor axons. To identify potential target labels, we screened 410 genes encoding cell-surface and secreted proteins, searching for those whose overexpression on all muscle fibers causes motor axons to make targeting errors. Thirty such genes were identified, and a number of these were members of a large gene family encoding proteins whose extracellular domains contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences, which are protein interaction modules. By manipulating gene expression in muscle 12, we showed that four LRR proteins participate in the selection of this muscle as the appropriate synaptic target for the RP5 motor neuron. In Drosophila embryos and larvae, a small number of identified motor neurons innervate body wall muscles in a highly stereotyped pattern.

Genetic screens in Drosophila and C. elegans have identified cell-surface and secreted (CSS) proteins involved in axon guidance, synaptic target selection, and presynaptic differentiation. In some cases these steps involve distinct sets of CSS proteins, while in others overlapping sets of proteins are involved in multiple steps. Mutations affecting immunoglobulin (Ig)-domain cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), cadherins, receptor tyrosine phosphatases, and Wnt proteins can produce phenotypes in which axons reach their targets but then fail to form normal synapses (Inaki et al., 2007Inaki M.

Molecular mechanisms of target specificity during synapse formation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 83-88Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of the most accessible systems for examination of target selection is the Drosophila larval neuromuscular system. This is a simpler subset of the central nervous system (CNS), with only 36 identified motor neurons per abdominal hemisegment (reviewed by Ruiz-Canada and Budnik, 2006Ruiz-Canada C. Budnik V. Introduction on the use of the Drosophila embryonic/larval neuromuscular junction as a model system to study synapse development and function, and a brief summary of pathfinding and target recognition.Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2006; 75: 1-31Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These neurons innervate a set of 30 body wall muscle fibers in an invariant pattern. Motor axons leave the CNS in three nerve roots: the ISN, SN, and TN. One of the ISN branches, ISNb (also called SNb) initially follows the ISN pathway, leaving it at the “exit junction” to enter the ventrolateral muscle (VLM) field. ISNb innervates seven muscles: 6, 7, 12, and 13 (internal layer), and 14, 30, and 28 (external layer). The SNa branch bifurcates at the dorsal edge of the VLMs; its ventral (or posterior) branch innervates muscles 5 and 8, which are immediately dorsal to the VLMs. The two TN axons fasciculate with the axon of the peripheral LBD neuron to form the TN tract. Every axon and synapse in the neuromuscular system can be visualized in dissected “fillet” preparations of embryos or larvae stained with antibodies such as monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1D4 (Vactor et al., 1993Vactor D.V. Sink H. Fambrough D. Tsoo R. Goodman C.S. Genes that control neuromuscular specificity in Drosophila.Cell. 1993; 73: 1137-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) increase greatly in size during the three stages (instars) of larval life in order to keep pace with the growth of the muscle fibers. Each NMJ arbor has a stereotyped pattern of outgrowth. However, NMJ growth is not autonomously determined within the motor neuron, but is driven by a homeostatic relationship between the neuron and its postsynaptic target (reviewed by Davis, 2006Davis G.W. Homeostatic control of neural activity: from phenomenology to molecular design.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Some of the signaling mechanisms involved in homeostasis resemble those used for synaptic development and plasticity in mammalian systems. Furthermore, the NMJ is a glutamatergic synapse that uses orthologs of vertebrate AMPA receptors. These features make the Drosophila NMJ a useful genetic model system for excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain. Many proteins involved in guidance of motor neuron growth cones have been identified. However, we know relatively little about how individual fibers within a muscle field are selected for innervation by specific motor axons. Two models, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed. In the relative balance model, each fiber is defined as a target by a mixture of generally expressed attractive and repulsive axon guidance cues that distinguish it from its neighbors (Winberg et al., 1998Winberg M.L. Mitchell K.J. Goodman C.S. Genetic analysis of the mechanisms controlling target selection: Complementary and combinatorial functions of netrins, semaphorins, and IgCAMs.Cell. 1998; 93: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the lock-and-key model, individual muscle fibers are specified by molecular labels that are recognized by receptors expressed by the innervating neurons (Hoang and Chiba, 1999Hoang B. Chiba A. ‘Identify’ and ‘lock in’: molecular integration during synaptic target recognition.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1399-1406Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The relative balance model was evaluated by altering expression of Netrin B (NetB), Semaphorin II (SemaII), and Fasciclin II (FasII) proteins on the VLMs. Netrins and Semaphorins regulate axon guidance in multiple contexts, while FasII is a homophilic Ig-CAM involved in axonal fasciculation. SemaII and FasII are expressed by all muscles, while NetB is expressed by muscles 6 and 7, which are innervated by the RP3 neuron. Removal of the attractive NetB cue reduces innervation of the 6/7 cleft by RP3, as does increasing muscle expression of the repulsive SemaII cue. Reducing SemaII levels causes the TN to make ectopic contacts on the VLMs, and this phenotype is strengthened by increasing FasII expression on muscles. Thus, VLM innervation can be controlled by adjusting the relative levels of a few attractive, repulsive, and adhesive cues. However, these cues are not essential for targeting: in a SemaII NetB double mutant lacking both attraction and repulsion, or in a FasII mutant, RP3 innervates the 6/7 cleft and the ISNb has a relatively normal morphology (Winberg et al., 1998Winberg M.L. Mitchell K.J. Goodman C.S. Genetic analysis of the mechanisms controlling target selection: Complementary and combinatorial functions of netrins, semaphorins, and IgCAMs.Cell. 1998; 93: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Investigations of the lock-and-key model have focused on CSS proteins that are expressed on individual VLM fibers. Fasciclin III (FasIII) is a homophilic Ig-CAM that is expressed on the RP3 growth cone and at the 6/7 cleft. Its adhesive properties and expression pattern make it an ideal candidate for an RP3 target label, but in a FasIII null mutant, RP3 still innervates muscles 6 and 7. When FasIII is expressed on the surrounding muscles in a wild-type background, however, RP3 mistargets to these muscles. Removing FasIII from the neuron suppresses mistargeting (Chiba et al., 1995Chiba A. Snow P. Keshishian H. Hotta Y. Fasciclin III as a synaptic target recognition molecule in Drosophila.Nature. 1995; 374: 166-168Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Kose et al., 1997Kose H. Rose D. Zhu X. Chiba A. Homophilic synaptic target recognition mediated by immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin III.Development. 1997; 124: 4143-4152Google Scholar). These results show that FasIII-mediated homophilic adhesion can divert RP3 to the wrong muscles, but is not required for RP3's recognition of its normal target. Capricious (Caps) is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein that is expressed on muscle 12, as well as on ventral muscles and a subset of dorsal muscles. When Caps is ectopically expressed on all muscles, a strong larval mistargeting phenotype (“12→13 loopback”) is observed in which the muscle 12 NMJ sends a collateral branch back onto muscle 13. caps null mutants have low-penetrance loopback phenotypes involving only a few boutons (Shishido et al., 1998Shishido E. Takeichi M. Nose A. Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with Leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). mRNA encoding the secreted protein Wnt4 is enriched in muscle 13. In Wnt4 LOF mutant embryos, RP5 axons, which normally target to muscle 12, transiently form synapses on muscle 13, suggesting that Wnt4 is a repulsive cue that normally prevents RP5 from synapsing on muscle 13 (Inaki et al., 2007Inaki M. Yoshikawa S. Thomas J.B. Aburatani H. Nose A. Wnt4 is a local repulsive cue that determines synaptic target specificity.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1574-1579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The data summarized above show that although alterations in CSS protein expression can influence target selection in the neuromuscular system, none of the CSS cues that have been identified thus far are required for normal targeting. This may be partially due to genetic redundancy. Each muscle fiber might express several different cues, any of which can be used for target recognition by innervating growth cones. Consistent with this interpretation, the only identified gene for which LOF mutations produce strong targeting phenotypes is abrupt (ab), which encodes a transcription factor expressed in muscles. In ab embryos, ISNb nerves have a variety of different abnormal morphologies, suggesting that axons cannot recognize any of the VLMs as targets. Perhaps Ab regulates a battery of ISNb muscle targeting cues, and all of these cues are absent or misregulated in ab mutants (Hu et al., 1995Hu S. Fambrough D. Atashi J.R. Goodman C.S. Crews S.T. The Drosophila abrupt gene encodes a BTB-zinc finger regulatory protein that controls the specificity of neuromuscular connections.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2936-2948Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The results on FasIII and Caps suggest that new target labels could be identified by performing a gain-of-function (GOF) screen for genes whose overexpression on all muscles cause axonal mistargeting phenotypes without affecting the structures of the muscles themselves. Overexpression/misexpression screens are commonly done using “EP”-like transposable elements, which contain “UAS” sequences recognized by the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 upstream of a basal promoter (Rorth et al., 1998Rorth P. Szabo K. Bailey A. Laverty T. Rehm J. Rubin G.M. Weigmann K. Milan M. Benes V. Ansorge W. Cohen S.M. Systematic gain-of-function genetics in Drosophila.Development. 1998; 125: 1049-1057PubMed Google Scholar). Like other P elements, EPs tend to transpose into the 5′ ends of genes. When an EP line with a 5′ insertion is crossed to a “driver” line expressing GAL4 in a particular cell type, the gene downstream of the EP will be expressed in that cell type in the F1 progeny of the cross (Brand and Perrimon, 1993Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one screen of this type, 500 random EP insertions were crossed to the panmuscle 24B-GAL4 driver (Luo et al., 1994Luo L. Liao Y.J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Distinct morphogenetic functions of similar small GTPases: Drosophila Drac1 is involved in axonal outgrowth and myoblast fusion.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) and F1 larvae examined for mistargeting defects (Umemiya et al., 2002Umemiya T. Takasu E. Takeichi M. Aigaki T. Nose A. Forked end: a novel transmembrane protein involved in neuromuscular specificity in drosophila identified by gain-of-function screening.J. Neurobiol. 2002; 51: 205-214Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In our screen, we planned to examine individual larvae by confocal microscopy in order to ensure that we could detect subtle phenotypes. This meant that we could not analyze thousands of lines, as would be required in order to identify genes encoding CSS proteins in a random EP screen. We thus decided to conduct a “directed” screen of genes encoding CSS proteins that are likely to be involved in cell recognition events. To do this, we constructed a database of Drosophila genes that encode such proteins, and found EP-like insertions that could drive 410 of these genes. The EP lines were crossed to 24B-GAL4 and the resulting F1 larvae examined for mistargeting and synaptic phenotypes. Our screen cannot assay all CSS proteins encoded in the genome. However, we hoped that identification of all the mistargeting genes within the ∼40% of the CSS repertoire accessible through EP lines would inform us as to which protein families are likely to include target labels. We may have succeeded in this effort, because our screen identified 16 CSS LRR proteins that either cause axonal mistargeting or affect NMJ arbor structure when they are expressed on all muscles. Here we present evidence that four LRR proteins actually function as synaptic targeting cues. To create a database of Drosophila CSS proteins potentially involved in cell recognition, we performed BLAST searches with extracellular (XC) domain sequences from a variety of species and collated published information (see Supplemental Text available online for details). The database (Table S1) contains 976 proteins and more than 80 domain types. We then searched through all existing collections of UAS-containing EP-like lines and obtained those with insertions 5′ to CSS database genes that could be used to drive their expression. These insertions should drive 410 of the 976 genes in the database, or over 40% of the cell recognition repertoire (Tables S1 and S2). Fifty-three of these 410 genes encode proteins with LRRs. The ISNb contains the axons of seven type I (glutamatergic) neurons, including RP1, 3, 4, and 5, which are 1b (big boutons) neurons (Hoang and Chiba, 2001Hoang B. Chiba A. Single-cell analysis of Drosophila larval neuromuscular synapses.Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Landgraf et al., 1997Landgraf M. Bossing T. Technau G.M. Bate M. The origin, location, and projections of the embryonic abdominal motorneurons of Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9642-9655PubMed Google Scholar). After entering the VLM field, the ISNb axon bundle extends dorsally, traveling between the external (14 and 28) and internal (6 and 7) muscle layers (diagram in Figure 1B). The RP3 axon leaves the bundle and forms an NMJ in the cleft between muscles 6 and 7. The remaining axons then traverse to the internal face of muscle 13, where RP1 and 4 form synapses. The RP5 axon grows past muscle 13 to the ISNb termination point on the internal face of muscle 12. In early stage 17 embryos, the nascent RP5 synapses are at the ventral edge of muscle 12, but by first instar, RP5 has formed an NMJ that extends across the muscle surface. By third instar, all of the VLMs are also innervated by a 1s (small boutons) neuron. The internal surfaces of muscles 13 and 12 lie in a plane, and the RP5 growth cone that will innervate muscle 12 has full access to both muscles when it reaches the embryonic ISNb termination point. This may account for the observation that the muscle 12 versus 13 decision is often perturbed in ectopic expression experiments (Shishido et al., 1998Shishido E. Takeichi M. Nose A. Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with Leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Umemiya et al., 2002Umemiya T.

Neurobiol. 2002; 51: 205-214Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We screened the CSS insertion collection for genes conferring ISNb mistargeting and/or presynaptic terminal phenotypes when overexpressed in postsynaptic cells. To do this, 462 insertion lines representing 410 genes (Table S2) were crossed to the 24B-GAL4 driver, which confers high-level expression in all somatic muscles from stage 12 onward, persisting into third instar (Luo et al., 1994Luo L. Liao Y.J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Distinct morphogenetic functions of similar small GTPases: Drosophila Drac1 is involved in axonal outgrowth and myoblast fusion.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). F1 third-instar larvae from these crosses were stained with mAb 1D4 to visualize axons and NMJs. Muscles were visualized with UAS-GFP driven by 24B-GAL4 or by Alexa-488-phalloidin staining. For the initial screen of each cross, we examined the VLM regions of 10 A2 hemisegments (five larvae) using confocal microscopy. Genes producing mistargeting were then tested with another early panmuscle driver (G14-GAL4) and a panneuronal driver (Elav-GAL4; see screen flowchart in Figure 1A). The normal pattern of innervation is shown in Figure 2A and depicted schematically in Figure 8. The 30 genes conferring mistargeting with ≥30% penetrance are listed in Tables 1 and S3, and Figure 2 shows examples of phenotypes.Table 1Mistargeting Genes Identified in the ScreenGene Name/CGProtein DomainsSP, TM Domains24B %Group 1CG14351/hafLRR-8SP, TM-130%CG3413/windpipeLRR-2SP, TM-130%CG2901SPX, EXSTM-4?100%CG9342Lipoprotein N-terminalSP30%CG8668GlycosyltransferaseSP30%CG11372/galectinConASP40%Group 2CG7291/NPC2MLSP30%CG12004DUF300TM-730%CG5758Fasciclin ISP50%CG32373Sushi/CCP(EGF-like)SP30%CG7179CUBSP30%CG7447EGF-likeSP30%CG14469/Dpr12IgSP30%CG2578/ten-aEGF-likeTM-140%CG5634/distractedCUB(SP), TM-140%CG10772/fur-1FurinTM-230%Group 3tartanLRR-10SP, TM-160%18-wheelerLRR-20SP, TM-140%capriciousLRR-11SP, TM-160%NetBNetrinSP80%papillote/CG2467ZP/PANSP, TM-150%neuromusculinIg9TM-130%Group 4hikaru genkiSushi/CCP(EGF-like)SP40%robo2Ig/FN3(SP), TM-140%pvf3/CG34378PDGFSP30%shiftedWIFSP30%turtleIg/FN3TM-140%neurexin IVEGF-likeSP30%GliotactinAcetylcholinesterase(SP), TM-130%outstretchednoneSP30%Genes in group 1 and group 2 are “new”; group 3 and group 4 genes were previously characterized using genetics.

We also found 55 other genes whose overexpression in postsynaptic muscles caused major alterations in the morphologies of NMJ presynaptic terminals without affecting the structures of the muscles themselves (Figure S1; Table S4). The screen is described in detail in the Supplemental Text. To identify mistargeting genes that are normally expressed in cells that would be contacted by ISNb axons during their outgrowth through the VLM field and therefore might encode genuine targeting molecules, we examined their expression in wild-type embryos using in situ hybridization. The cells of interest include the VLMs themselves, ventral peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons, ventral tracheal branches, ventral epidermis, and peripheral glia. Six “new” genes (those not previously characterized using genetics; group 1 in Table 1) were found to be expressed in some of these cells, as were six previously characterized genes (group 3 in Table 1). We noted that 5 of these 12 genes encode cell-surface LRR proteins: Caps, Tartan (Trn), 18-wheeler (18w), CG14351, and CG3413/Windpipe. All other domain types (Ig, ZP/PAN, Netrin, ConA, and others) are represented by only a single gene within this group. Groups 2 (new genes) and 4 (previously characterized genes) in Table 1 may or may not be expressed in the cells of interest (see Table S3 for further information on all mistargeting genes). Within the LRR set, we initially focused on Trn, Caps, and CG14351 because they are normally expressed by muscles (Artero et al., 2003Artero R. Furlong E.E. Beckett K. Scott M.P. Baylies M.

Takeichi M. Nose A. Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with Leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Figure S2). We also selected CG8561, an LRR gene identified as producing NMJ phenotypes (Figure 1A; Table S4), for further investigation. CG8561 generates mistargeting with 20% penetrance and is expressed in muscles (Figure S3). The XC domains of Trn and Caps are 65% identical (Chang et al., 1993Chang Z. Price B.D. Bockheim S.

Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with Leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Studies of Trn and Caps function in imaginal discs suggest that the two proteins can interact with a common receptor (Milan et al., 2005Milan M. Perez L. Cohen S.M. Boundary formation in the Drosophila wing: functional dissection of Capricious and Tartan.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 804-810Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and trn caps double mutants have stronger boundary formation phenotypes during leg segmentation than do single mutants (Sakurai et al., 2007Sakurai K.T. Kojima T. Aigaki T. Hayashi S. Differential control of cell affinity required for progression and refinement of cell boundary during Drosophila leg segmentation.Dev. Biol. 2007; 309: 126-136Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Trn and Caps might also function in a redundant manner to regulate axon guidance and label muscles as axonal targets. caps LOF mutants have very weak mistargeting phenotypes (Shishido et al., 1998Shishido E. Takeichi M. Nose A. Drosophila synapse formation: regulation by transmembrane protein with Leu-rich repeats, CAPRICIOUS.Science. 1998; 280: 2118-2121Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), so Caps alone is not necessary for targeting. We could not assess trn LOF phenotypes in larvae, because trn mutants die before third instar. We made trn RNAi lines from our own inverted repeat constructs, but these did not produce larval phenotypes when crossed to 24B-GAL4 or other drivers. Thus, to define the trn phenotype, and to ascertain whether Trn and Caps have redundant functions, we examined trn, caps, and trn caps phenotypes in embryos. We evaluated phenotypes for two trn alleles: trn28.4, which deletes coding sequence and is likely to be a null allele, and trns064117, an embryonic lethal insertion mutation that does not interrupt the coding region. We also examined caps65.2, a null excision allele, and the double mutant trns064117 caps65.2. We quantitated motor axon phenotypes in late stage 16/early stage 17 embryo fillets by staining with mAb 1D4 and scoring segments A2–A7 (Figure 3H). trn28.4 homozygotes had a mild CNS phenotype and some muscle patterning defects (see also Artero et al., 2003Artero R. Furlong E.E. Beckett K. Scott M.P. Baylies M. Notch and Ras signaling pathway effector genes expressed in fusion competent and founder cells during Drosophila myogenesis.Development. 2003; 130: 6257-6272Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We quantitated phenotypes in hemisegments with normal muscles, and found that they had strong motor axon guidance phenotypes that primarily affected the ISNb and SNa nerves (Figure 3H). These included “stall” phenotypes in which the ISNb was truncated ventral to muscle 13, suggesting that the axons stopped prematurely, “bypass” phenotypes in which the ISNb failed to leave the ISN pathway at the exit junction, and SNa bifurcation failures (see Figure 1B for normal embryonic ISNb pathways). trns064117 mutants had no visible CNS phenotypes and only rare muscle-patterning defects. They displayed a similar spectrum of motor axon guidance phenotypes to trn28.4 embryos, but with a lower penetrance (25% ISNb, 29% SNa defects for trns064117, versus 40% ISNb, 33% SNa defects for trn28.4; Figure 3H). caps65.2 embryos had weak ISNb phenotypes and no SNa phenotypes (15% total ISNb defects and 2% SNa defects were observed in caps mutants, while the background ISNb defect penetrance was 7% for TM3armGFP/+ (balancer control) embryos; the background SNa defect penetrance was 2%). Ectopic ISNb projections to the TN were described in an earlier study of caps mutant embryos, but the penetrance was not reported (Abrell and Jackle, 2001Abrell S. Jackle H. Axon guidance of Drosophila SNb motoneurons depends on the cooperative action of muscular Kruppel and neuronal capricious activities.Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 3-12Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We occasionally saw such phenotypes (12%), but they were seen with a similar frequency in balancer controls. Double mutants (trns064117 caps65.2) also had no CNS phenotypes, and < 7% of hemisegments had a missing muscle. The penetrances of the ISNb and SNa phenotypes (55% and 60%, respectively) in double-mutant embryos were roughly doubled relative to trns064117 single mutants and were higher than those observed in trn null mutants (Figure 3H). The differences in penetrance between trn and trn caps are statistically significant (p < .001, chi-square test). This shows that the two genes interact. The trn caps phenotype was rescued to ∼20% penetrance for both ISNb and SNa phenotypes (Figure 3H) by neuronal expression of Trn driven by Elav-GAL4. Rescue is statistically significant (see Figure 3 legend), and the ISNb phenotypic penetrance in neuronal rescue embryos is only slightly higher than in caps single mutants, suggesting that loss of Trn from neurons accounts for the ISNb axon guidance errors. For SNa, the penetrance in rescued embryos is still considerably higher than for caps single mutants, so loss of Trn from muscles may also contribute to this phenotype. We did not examine rescue by GAL4-driven expression of Trn in muscles, since this produces the dominant phenotypes that allowed us to identify trn as a gene of interest in our screen. Double-mutant ISNbs that passed the center of muscle 13 sometimes exhibited a striking “terminal loop” phenotype at early stage 17 that has not been described for any other mutant. It was never observed in trn or caps single mutants (n = 197 hemisegments for trn, n = 202 for caps). Most ISNb nerves with the loop phenotype had formed synapses at the muscle 6/7 cleft, showing that overall ISNb development is relatively normal. We also confirmed that the loop hemisegments all had normal muscle patterning. The distal edge of the terminal loop was at the muscle 12/13 junction or on the surface of muscle 13 (Figures 3A–3G). The terminal loop phenotype is reminiscent of the 12→13 loopback phenotypes observed in the larval screen (Figures 2B and 2C) and suggests that the RP5 axon destined for muscle 12 did not recognize it as the preferred target and turned back onto muscle 13. We estimate that >20% of ISNbs in double mutants that reach the center of muscle 13 have these terminal loops. However, the exact penetranc"

The worldwide spread of tuberculosis has been fuelled by the development and spread of drug- and multidrug-resistant Mtb strains (2Matsumoto M. Hashizume H. Tsubouchi H. Sasaki H. Itotani M.

The growing numbers of Mtb strains resistant to front line antitubercular drugs (e.g. rifampicin and isoniazid) has revealed a dearth of effective second line agents and has highlighted a desperate need for the development of novel drugs (3Spigelman M.K.

Against this backdrop, the determination of the Mtb H37Rv genome sequence (and latterly the Mtb CDC1551 sequence) provided important new information toward a more detailed understanding of the biology of Mtb, its genome organization, and its protein repertoire (4Cole S.T.

Mtb H37Rv is a virulent strain that has been the most commonly used Mtb strain in laboratory and clinical studies for over 50 years. Its genome revealed an unexpectedly large number of genes encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP or P450) enzymes, 20 CYP genes in the 4.41-megabase Mtb H37Rv genome (4Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J.

The Escherichia coli genome (of similar size) is devoid of P450s, and the 57 P450s in the human genome are contained within a ~3000-megabase genome. Thus, the CYP gene ?density? in the Mtb genome is >200-fold that in the human genome, indicating important cellular roles for these Mtb oxygenases (6McLean K.J. Clift D. Lewis D.G. Sabri M.

In addition, the first prokaryotic example of a sterol demethylase P450 (CYP51B1) was identified in Mtb (4Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K.

This raised the possibility that Mtb P450s could be novel drug targets, since fungal CYP51s are validated targets for azole drugs (e.g. fluconazole and clotrimazole) that coordinate the P450 heme iron and prevent oxidative transformation of lanosterol to ergosterol, with severe effects on fungal membrane integrity (8Odds F.C. Brown A.J. Brown A.J. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 272-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). It was shown subsequently that several imidazole and triazole-based antifungals were effective anti-mycobacterial agents, with MIC values for various azoles being on the order of 0.1?20 ?g/ml for M. smegmatis (9Guardiola-Diaz H.M.

However, CYP51B1 is not an essential gene for Mtb viability in culture and is unlikely to be a Mtb azole drug target (12Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). Instead, the Mtb CYP121 P450 was shown to bind very tightly to a range of azole antifungal drugs. Hitherto, there has been no evidence presented for the essentiality (or otherwise) of the CYP121 gene (Rv2276) in Mtb H37Rv (12Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). Although Mtb genome-wide transposon mutagenesis revealed that several P450 genes were not essential for viability or optimal growth in vitro, these studies did show that CYP128 was essential (12Sassetti C.M.

The CYP51B1-fluconazole complex structure demonstrated direct coordination of P450 heme iron by a fluconazole triazole nitrogen (15Podust L.M. Poulos T.L. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3068-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The ligand-free structure of CYP121 revealed a highly constrained active site, and major reorganization of CYP121 structure was predicted to be necessary to facilitate direct azole coordination of the P450 heme iron (18Leys D.

However, the fluconazole-bound CYP121 structure showed a relative lack of structural perturbation and instead revealed an unusual mode of inhibitory coordination, with the azole nitrogen bridging to the heme iron via an interstitial water molecule (17Seward H.E.

This type of binding was observed previously by Poulos and Howard (19Poulos T.L. Howard A.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8165-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) in studies of 2-phenylimidazole binding to P450cam. Recently, the structure of Mtb CYP130 (encoded by the Rv1256c gene absent from the genome of the Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine strain) was solved in complex with econazole, an effective antitubercular drug (20Ouellet H.

However, CYP130 is a nonessential gene in Mtb strain CDC1551 (23Lamichhane G. Zignol M. Blades N.J. Geiman D.E. Dougherty A. Grosset J. Broman K.W. Bishai W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ligand-free CYP121 structure was the highest resolution P450 atomic structure solved to date (1.06 A?) and also revealed novel aspects of P450 structure, including (i) a distorted heme macrocycle caused by the displacement of a pyrrole group by a proline side chain, (ii) heme bound in two distinct conformations related by a 180? flip, and (iii) a relatively rigid active site hydrogen-bonded network of residues above the heme plane that defined the active site geometry and might contribute to a proton relay pathway to the heme iron (18Leys D.

In this study, we validate the importance of CYP121 to Mtb H37Rv viability by establishing its essentiality through CYP121 gene knock-out. We investigate the active site structure and role of several residues in the vicinity of the heme through a systematic determination of CYP121 mutant atomic structures, allied to detailed spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and azole binding analysis of these active site variants. We also report the MIC values for inhibition of Mtb H37Rv growth by azole drugs and compare these with their affinity (Kd values) for CYP121 and active site mutants thereof. Our study defines a new gene (CYP121) essential for viability of Mtb H37Rv and details the structural and biophysical properties of key CYP121 active site mutants. These data reveal important determinants of heme iron coordination and heme conformational and thermodynamic properties of CYP121 and enable a more detailed understanding of roles of residues either unique to CYP121 or broadly conserved in the P450 superfamily. A deletion delivery vector was generated by amplifying the upstream and downstream regions of CYP121 using primer pairs EUF5 (AAG CTT GAG ACG ACT CTG CTC CCA AC) and EUR5 (GGT ACC GCA CAG TGC ATA CGA GGA GA), and EUF6 (GGT ACC GCG CTG TTG AAA AAG ATG C) and EUR6 (GCG GCC GCA ACA CCG TTC TGG CGA TTA C) and cloning into p2NIL (24Parish T.

The gene cassette from pGOAL19 (24Parish T. Stoker N. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) was cloned in as a PacI fragment to generate the final delivery vector pTACK121. A complementing vector (pCOLE121) was constructed by amplifying the CYP121 gene using primers CYP121D1 (CCT TAA TTA ATC GTT GAA TTG CTA CCA CCA) and CYP121D2 (CCT TAA TTA AGG TGC AAG GTC GAA ATT GTT) (PacI sites underlined) and subcloned into pAPA3 (25Parish T. Stoker N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5715-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) under the control of the Ag85a promoter. Attempts to construct the CYP121 deletion strain using a two-step homologous recombination method were made (24Parish T. Stoker N. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A single crossover strain was generated by electroporating M. tuberculosis with 5 ?g of UV-treated pTACK121, and recombinants were selected on 100 ?g/ml hygromycin, 20 ?g/ml kanamycin, and 50 ?g/ml X-gal (24Parish T. Stoker N. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A single strain was streaked out in the absence of any antibiotics to allow the second crossover to occur. Double crossovers were selected and screened for using 2% (w/v) sucrose and 50 ?g/ml X-gal; white colonies were patch-tested for kanamycin and hygromycin sensitivity to ensure that they had lost the plasmid. PCR was used to screen for the presence of the wild type (WT) or deletion allele using primers CYP121D1 and CYP121D2. To generate a merodiploid strain, pCOLE121 was electroporated into the single crossover strain, and recombinants were isolated on 10 ?g/ml gentamicin, 100 ?g/ml hygromycin, 20 ?g/ml kanamycin, and 50 ?g/ml X-gal. A single recombinant was streaked out without antibiotics to allow a second crossover to occur, and double crossovers were isolated as before, except that gentamicin was included at all stages. PCR was used to screen for the presence of the WT or deletion allele using primers CYP121D1 and CYP121D2. Southern blot analysis was used to confirm the genotype of strains. Azole susceptibility testing on M. tuberculosis H37Rv was done by radiometric measurements using the BACTEC 460 system (BD Biosciences). A standard protocol was followed, using a biosafety level 3 biocontainment facility (25Parish T. Stoker N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5715-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The BACTEC vials contained Middlebrook 7H12B medium (BD Biosciences) with 14C-labeled palmitic acid as a carbon source. Four different azole drugs were tested for bacterial growth inhibition (econazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, and clotrimazole). Concentrated stocks of the azoles were made in DMSO and stored at -70 ?C until use. A range of azole drug concentrations were tested from 2 to 64 ?g/ml. The principle of the BACTEC system is described in more detail in the supplemental material. Short term culture filtrate and total cell lysate of M. tuberculosis H37Rv proteins were prepared as previously described (26Rosenkrands I. Aagaard C. Weldingh K. Brock I. Dziegiel M.H. Singh M. Hoff S. Ravn P. Andersen P. Tuberculosis. 2008; 88: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Antiserum 1426D used for identification of CYP121 was raised by immunizing rats with purified, recombinant CYP121 delivered in Montanide ISA720 adjuvant (Seppic, Paris, France). SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed as described under reducing conditions. To reduce responses to potential E. coli contaminants 1426D serum was absorbed with an E. coli extract for Western blot experiments (26Rosenkrands I. Aagaard C. Weldingh K. Brock I. Dziegiel M.H. Singh M. Hoff S. Ravn P. Andersen P. Tuberculosis. 2008; 88: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of CYP121 was done using the Stratagene QuikChange? site-directed mutagenesis kit for mutants A233G, F338H, S237A, S279A, R386L, and P346L. Mutant clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech) using generic T7 and T7 terminator oligonucleotide primers, allowing verification of entire gene sequences. Full methods for mutant production are given in the supplemental material. Primers used for CYP121 mutant gene generation are detailed in Table S1. The Mtb Rv2276 gene encoding WT CYP121 protein was expressed from E. coli HMS174 (DE3)/pKM2b transformants (22McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CYP121 protein was prepared from 10-liter cultures, as described previously (22McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mutant CYP121 proteins were prepared similarly. The purity of CYP121 proteins was assessed by spectral properties (ratio of Soret absorption, at 416.5 nm in most cases, to protein-specific absorption at 280 nm, with an A416.5/A280 ratio of >1.8 indicating pure protein), and by SDS-PAGE analysis of protein samples (on 12% denaturing gels). CYP121 concentration was determined from the Soret absorption of the ferric enzyme in its ligand-free low spin state using ?416.5 = 110 mm-1 cm-1, as described previously (27Mclean K.J. Warman A.J. Seward H.E. Marshall K.R. Girvan H.M. Cheesman M.R. Waterman M.R. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8427-8443Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For CYP121 mutants that displayed some high spin heme iron, a NO complex was generated by brief bubbling of ferric enzyme with NO gas. This gave rise to a single Fe(III)NO species (rather than a mixture of high spin and low spin Fe(III) species), and the absorption at the new Soret peak (437 nm; ?437 = 102 mm-1 cm-1) was then used to determine mutant enzyme concentration with reference to WT and as detailed in our previous work (27Mclean K.J.

Complete data sets were obtained on single flash-cooled crystals at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ID14 stations. Data were analyzed and merged using MOSFLM and SCALA (28Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26Google Scholar, 29Evans P.R. Acta Crystallogr.

Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The oxidation state of the CYP121 heme may be ferrous, by analogy with the observed effects of synchrotron radiation on other heme proteins (32Beitlich T. Ku?hnel K. Schulze-Briese C. Shoeman R.L. Schlichting I. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2007; 14: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For final data and refinement statistics, see Table S2. Optical titrations for determination of azole binding constants (Kd values) were done as previously described (22McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A.

Pure WT CYP121 and mutants (typically 1?3 ?m) were suspended in Buffer A in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette, and a spectrum for the ligand-free form was recorded (250?800 nm) at 25 ?C on a Cary UV-50 Bio scanning spectrophotometer (Varian, UK). Azole ligands (clotrimazole, econazole, fluconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, 2-phenylimidazole (2-PIM), and 4-phenylimidazole (4-PIM)) were titrated from concentrated stocks in DMSO solvent (apart from the phenylimidazoles, which were prepared in 60% ethanol) until no further optical perturbation was observed. Full information on titration methods is provided in the supplemental material. Induced optical change versus ligand concentration data were fitted using either a standard hyperbolic function (for data from 2-PIM and 4-PIM titrations) or to Equation 1, which provides a more accurate description of the binding of the antifungal azoles to WT and mutant forms of CYP121 (22McLean K.J.

UV-visible Spectroscopy?All UV-visible absorption spectra for oxidized WT and mutant CYP121 enzymes were recorded on a Cary UV-50 spectrophotometer in Buffer A at 25 ?C, as were spectra for azole ligand complexes and for Fe(III)NO and Fe(II)CO complexes. Resonance Raman?Resonance Raman (RR) spectra were obtained using 15-milliwatt, 406.7-nm radiation at the sample, from a Coherent Innova 300 krypton ion laser, and acquired using a Renishaw micro-Raman system 1000 spectrophotometer. The sample in Buffer A was held in a capillary under the microscope at a concentration of ~50 ?m, and an extended scan was obtained from 200 to 1700 cm-1 (total exposure time of 30 s). Ligand-free and fluconazole (100 ?m)-bound CYP121 samples were analyzed. Data processing, curve fitting, and band assignment was done using GRAMS/32 software (Thermo Scientific). EPR Spectroscopy?EPR spectra for the ferric CYP121 WT and mutant enzymes were recorded on a Bruker ER-300D series electromagnet and microwave source interfaced with a Bruker EMX control unit and fitted with an ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments) and a dual mode microwave cavity from Bruker (ER-4116DM). Spectra were recorded at 10 K with a microwave power of 2.08 milliwatts and a modulation amplitude of 10 gauss for the CYP121 enzymes. Oxidized CYP121 and mutant samples were prepared in Buffer A. In order to establish if active site mutations disrupted electron transfer from NADPH to the P450 heme iron, kinetics of electron transport were analyzed using a Mtb H37Rv class I P450 redox system comprising the NAD(P)H-dependent flavoprotein reductase (FprA, encoded by Rv3106), the 3Fe-4S ferredoxin Fdx (encoded by Rv0763c adjacent to the CYP51B1 gene on the genome), and the relevant WT or mutant CYP121 protein. Conditions were 4 ?m CYP121 protein, 18 ?m Fdx, and 4 ?m FprA in 1 ml of Buffer A at 25 ?C. The buffer was deaerated and saturated with CO by extensive bubbling with the gas in a sealed quartz cuvette. Thereafter, the protein components were added (less than 20 ?l of total additions), and the reaction was initiated by injection of 300 ?m NADPH. Spectra (250?800 nm) were recorded regularly until no further change was detected and the P450 Fe(II)CO complexes were fully formed. The kinetics of complex formation were determined by plotting extent of Fe(II)CO complex formation against reaction time and fitting the resultant data using an exponential function and Origin software. Bacterial growth media (Tryptone, yeast extract) were from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, Suffolk, UK). The 1-kb DNA ladder was from Promega. Azole drugs were from MP Biomedicals Inc. All other reagents were from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. We used a two-step homologous recombination strategy to demonstrate that CYP121 (Rv2276) is essential. A nonreplicating delivery vector carrying an unmarked in-frame deletion was constructed and used in a two-step homologous recombination process to isolate deletion mutants in either the WT or merodiploid. In the WT background, 40 double crossovers were screened by PCR, and all had the WT genotype. In contrast, we were able to isolate double crossovers with the deletion in the merodiploid background. Of eight strains screened, all had the deletion allele, and none had the WT allele. The genotype of the strains was confirmed by Southern analysis using two different restriction enzymes (Fig. 1). In parallel studies, we established that the CYP121 protein was produced by Mtb using immunological methods. Anti-CYP"
https://openalex.org/W1999107947,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (GluRs) play major roles in excitatory synaptic transmission. Neuronal AMPA receptors comprise GluR subunits and transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). Previous studies identified five mammalian TARPs, γ-2 (or stargazin), γ-3, γ-4, γ-7, and γ-8, that enhance AMPA receptor function. Here, we classify γ-5 as a distinct class of TARP that modulates specific GluR2-containing AMPA receptors and displays properties entirely dissimilar from canonical TARPs. γ-5 increases peak currents and decreases the steady-state currents selectively from GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. Furthermore, γ-5 increases rates of GluR2 deactivation and desensitization and decreases glutamate potency. Remarkably, all effects of γ-5 require editing of GluR2 mRNA. Unlike other TARPs, γ-5 modulates GluR2 without promoting receptor trafficking. We also find that γ-7 regulation of GluR2 is dictated by mRNA editing. These data establish γ-5 and γ-7 as a separate family of “type II TARPs” that impart distinct physiological features to specific AMPA receptors.

Glutamate serves as the major excitatory neurotransmitter in brain. Fast transmission at glutamate synapses is mediated by AMPA-, NMDA-, and kainate-type ion channels. The AMPA subtype induces most of the postsynaptic depolarization that leads to neuronal firing. This moment-to-moment signaling by AMPA receptors contributes fundamentally to sensory, motor, and integrative brain functions. Furthermore, activity-dependent changes in synaptic AMPA receptor levels contribute to the plasticity that underlies aspects of learning and memory (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A.

AMPA receptors comprise homo- and heterotetramers of GluR1-4 subunits, which contain both the glutamate-binding and ion channel structures (Hollmann and Heinemann, 1994Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Cloned glutamate receptors.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3586) Google Scholar, Seeburg, 1993Seeburg P.H. The Trends Neurosci./TiPS Lecture. The molecular biology of mammalian glutamate receptor channels.Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). These subunits show distinct ion channel conductances and kinetic properties. Alternative splicing, which yields flip and flop forms for each GluR subunit, further amplifies this diversity (Sommer et al., 1990Sommer B. Keinanen K. Verdoorn T.A. Wisden W. Burnashev N. Herb A. Kohler M. Takagi T. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Flip and flop: a cell-specific functional switch in glutamate-operated channels of the CNS.Science. 1990; 249: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Importantly, editing of the GluR2 mRNA changes a crucial Gln (Q) to Arg (R) in the ion channel pore region such that GluR2-containing AMPA receptors permeate only monovalent cations, whereas GluR2-lacking receptors also conduct Ca2+ (Hollmann et al., 1991Hollmann M.

Some studies suggest that “subunit-specific rules” differentially control AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity (Lee et al., 2004Lee S.H. Simonetta A. Sheng M.

Supporting these models for subunit-specific regulation of trafficking, certain binding partners for AMPA receptors associate specifically with GluR1 or GluR4 subunits, which have long cytoplasmic tails, whereas other interacting proteins bind to GluR2 or GluR3 subunits, which have short cytoplasmic tails. In addition to the GluR principal subunits, neuronal AMPA receptors also contain TARP auxiliary subunits (Nicoll et al., 2006Nicoll R.A. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Auxiliary subunits assist AMPA-type glutamate receptors.Science. 2006; 311: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, Vandenberghe et al., 2005bVandenberghe W. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin is an AMPA receptor auxiliary subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mutation of stargazin (or γ-2), the prototypical TARP, yields stargazer mice, which suffer absence epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia (Letts et al., 1998Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett II, F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. The mouse stargazer gene encodes a neuronal Ca2+-channel gamma subunit.Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). This ataxia is associated with selective loss of AMPA receptor function in cerebellar granule cells (Chen et al., 2000Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A.

Cellular studies of stargazer granule cells showed that stargazin escorts AMPA receptors through the secretory pathway to the synapse (Chen et al., 2000Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to trafficking AMPA receptors, stargazin also modulates receptor pharmacology and controls channel gating. Specifically, stargazin increases AMPA receptor glutamate affinity, enhances single-channel conductance, slows deactivation and desensitization, and reduces the extent of desensitization (Bedoukian et al., 2006Bedoukian M.A. Weeks A.M.

Furthermore, a family of three other highly homologous TARPs, γ-3, γ-4, and γ-8, regulate AMPA receptors in distinct cell types throughout the brain (Tomita et al., 2003Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Functional studies and distribution define a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins.J.

These four TARPs all show qualitatively similar regulation of all four GluR isoforms; however, distinct TARP subunits show differences in their modulation of channel gating. Specifically, γ-4 shows the quantitatively greatest effect to slow AMPA receptor gating (Cho et al., 2007Cho C.H. St-Gelais F. Zhang W. Tomita S. Howe J.R.

TARP subtypes differentially and dose-dependently control synaptic AMPA receptor gating.Neuron. 2007; 55: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). TARPs were originally named “γ-subunits” based on their sequence homology with the γ-1 tetraspanning calcium channel subunit (Jay et al., 1990Jay S.D. Ellis S.B. McCue A.F. Williams M.E. Vedvick T.S. Harpold M.M. Campbell K.P. Primary structure of the gamma subunit of the DHP-sensitive calcium channel from skeletal muscle.Science. 1990; 248: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which occurs only in skeletal and cardiac muscles and does not regulate AMPA receptors (Tomita et al., 2003Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Functional studies and distribution define a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The extended γ-subunit family contains the four canonical TARPs, as well as γ-1, -5, -6, and -7. Our original studies showed that γ-1 and γ-5 do not augment trafficking or gating of GluR1 (Tomita et al., 2003Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Functional studies and distribution define a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Whereas γ-1 and γ-6 occur largely in striated skeletal muscle, we recently reported that the highly homologous γ-7 and γ-5 proteins are enriched in brain and that γ-7—but not γ-5—greatly enhances glutamate-evoked currents from GluR1 (Kato et al., 2007Kato A.S. Zhou W. Milstein A.D. Knierman M.D. Siuda E.R. Dotzlaf J.E. Yu H. Hale J.E. Nisenbaum E.S. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. New transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein isoform, gamma-7, differentially regulates AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4969-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further, we found that γ-7—but not γ-5—partially restores functional AMPA receptors on stargazer cerebellar granule cells. Here, we examine possible roles for γ-5 in regulating AMPA receptors. Using an optimized immunoprecipitation procedure, we demonstrate that γ-5 associates with several GluR subunits in solubilized brain extracts. In heterologous cells, we find a unique subunit specificity for γ-5 in regulating GluR channel activity. That is, γ-5 enhances glutamate-evoked currents only from certain GluR2-containing receptors. The critical mRNA-edited Q/R site in the pore of GluR2 mediates this remarkable specificity. γ-5 also uniquely and greatly lowers glutamate affinity and markedly suppresses steady-state currents, especially from GluR2-containing receptors. Interestingly, γ-5 mediates all these regulatory effects without enhancing cellular trafficking of GluR subunits. The highly homologous γ-7 subunit shares some of these properties with γ-5. These studies define γ-5 and γ-7 as a subfamily of type II TARPs as compared to the type I TARPs, γ-2, γ-3, γ-4, and γ-8. This dichotomy of TARP function adds to the diversity of AMPA receptor physiology and plasticity. Previous studies showed that γ-5 is weakly and specifically bound to GluR1 in cerebellar extracts (Kato et al., 2007Kato A.S. Zhou W. Milstein A.D. Knierman M.D. Siuda E.R. Dotzlaf J.E. Yu H. Hale J.E. Nisenbaum E.S. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. New transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein isoform, gamma-7, differentially regulates AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4969-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here, we optimized the immunoprecipitation procedure by increasing the amounts and concentrations of solubilized membrane proteins and antibodies. This improved procedure showed specific binding of γ-5 with GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4 in cerebellar extracts (Figure 1A). We previously showed that γ-5 in cerebellum does not occur in the PSD (Kato et al., 2007Kato A.S. Zhou W. Milstein A.D. Knierman M.D. Siuda E.R. Dotzlaf J.E. Yu H. Hale J.E. Nisenbaum E.S. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. New transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein isoform, gamma-7, differentially regulates AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4969-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which could reflect the enrichment of γ-5 in cerebellar Bergman glia that lack PSD domains. To determine whether γ-5 in forebrain neurons might be enriched in the PSD, we fractionated membranes from olfactory bulb. We find that γ-5 in these preparations did partially enrich in the PSD and showed a similar fractionation as γ-2, -3, -4, and -8 (Figure 1B). As our anti-γ-5 antibody is not suitable for immunostaining of endogenous γ-5, we overexpressed γ-5 in cultured cortical neurons and coimmunostained with anti-PSD-95. Strong γ-5 signals were observed in somatic regions, and γ-5 was also concentrated in puncta along the neurites. Many of these γ-5 puncta colocalized with PSD-95 (see Figure S1 available online), implying a synaptic distribution. We next used whole-cell recordings from transfected HEK293 cells to evaluate regulation of AMPA receptors by γ-5. Individual cells were captured and perfused with a 16-barrel pipette array, which allowed for rapid sequential titration of pharmacological reagents. In HEK293 cells transfected with the flip form of GluR1 alone, glutamate application elicited a peak current of ∼2000 pA, which rapidly decayed to a steady-state current of ∼20 pA (Figure 2A). As previously reported (Tomita et al., 2003Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Functional studies and distribution define a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), cotransfection with γ-5 did not significantly alter either the peak or steady-state currents evoked from GluR1. By contrast, cotransfection of GluR1 with γ-2 or γ-7 augmented both the peak and steady-state currents (Figure 2A). As previously published (Kato et al., 2007Kato A.S. Zhou W. Milstein A.D. Knierman M.D. Siuda E.R. Dotzlaf J.E. Yu H. Hale J.E. Nisenbaum E.S. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. New transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein isoform, gamma-7, differentially regulates AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4969-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the glutamate-evoked currents from cells expressing GluR1 and γ-7 showed an unusual kinetic course comprising an initial peak and desensitization followed by a slower “run-up” in conductance to reach steady-state (Figure 2B). For these and all studies, we found that γ-6, a striated muscle protein that shares highest homology with γ-1, was without effect on glutamate-evoked currents. In contrast to the lack of effect of γ-5 on GluR1 responses, coexpression of γ-5 with GluR2 markedly enhanced the peak current from these receptors (Figures 2A and 3). This enhancement of peak current by γ-5 was coupled with a nearly complete elimination of steady-state current from GluR2 (Figures 2A, 2B, and 3). The augmentation of GluR2 glutamate-evoked peak current and reduction of steady-state current reveals an unappreciated role for γ-5 as a TARP isoform that enhances the extent of AMPA receptor desensitization. In comparison, γ-2 and γ-7 exhibited classical TARP activity by augmenting both the peak and the steady-state glutamate-evoked currents from GluR2 (Figures 2A, 2B, and 3). Of note, the effects of γ-7 on GluR2 were similar to its effects on GluR1 such that there was an enhancement of peak current followed by rapid desensitization and a subsequent gradual increase to steady-state current (Figure 2B). We further evaluated the effects of γ-2, γ-5, and γ-7 on GluR3 and GluR4. As previously published, γ-2 enhanced both the peak and steady-state currents from cells transfected with GluR3 or GluR4 (Figure 3). In contrast, γ-5 and γ-7 had no effects on the peak current of GluR4 and even reduced that of GluR3. For steady-state currents, γ-5 had minimal effects whereas γ-7 increased steady-state currents from GluR3, but not GluR4. Because of the extremely rapid desensitization of AMPA receptors, the maximal currents measured in our experiments underestimate the true peak current. To better assess the effects of TARPs on the maximal peak glutamate-evoked currents, we added cyclothiazide (CTZ), which blocks desensitization of the flip isoform of GluR subunits. Consistent with previous findings (Kott et al., 2007Kott S. Werner M. Korber C. Hollmann M. Electrophysiological properties of AMPA receptors are differentially modulated depending on the associated member of the TARP family.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3780-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), γ-2 enhanced the responses of GluR1-4 to glutamate in the presence of CTZ (Figure 2, Figure 3). In marked contrast, both γ-5 and γ-7 selectively enhanced the maximal glutamate-evoked current of GluR2 in the presence of CTZ with minimal effects on GluR1, GluR3, and GluR4. Collectively, the preceding data in the absence and presence of CTZ demonstrate that, in contrast to the augmentation of all GluRs by the type I TARPs, including stargazin (Kott et al., 2007Kott S. Werner M. Korber C. Hollmann M. Electrophysiological properties of AMPA receptors are differentially modulated depending on the associated member of the TARP family.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3780-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), γ-5 and γ-7 selectively enhance responses of GluR2 and GluR1-2, respectively. This characteristic and others described below distinguish γ-2, γ-3, γ-4, and γ-8 from γ-5 and γ-7; therefore, we will hereafter refer to these families as type I TARPs and type II TARPs, respectively. As GluR1 coimmunoprecipitated with γ-5 from cerebellum (Figure 1A), we explored functional modulation of GluR1 by γ-5. Recent studies showed that type I TARPs modulate the rectification of AMPA receptor-mediated currents (Kott et al., 2008Kott S. Sager C. Tapken D. Werner M. Hollmann M. Comparative analysis of the pharmacology of GluR1 in complex with transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins gamma2, gamma3, gamma4, and gamma8.Neuroscience. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar, Soto et al., 2007Soto D. Coombs I.D. Kelly L. Farrant M. Cull-Candy S.G. Stargazin attenuates intracellular polyamine block of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similar to type I TARPs, γ-5 (and γ-7) also modulated the rectification of GluR1 currents (Figure S2), implying that γ-5 physically associates with GluR1. Our functional data suggest that type II TARPs also bind to GluR3 homomers, as γ-5 and γ-7 reduced the peak currents of GluR3, and γ-7 increased steady-state currents of GluR3 (Figure 3). These observations indicate that type II TARPs associate broadly with GluRs, but that regulation is strictly subunit specific. The differential effects of γ-5 on gating of GluR2 versus other subunits suggested a possible role for the “Q/R site” in the pore region of the channel, which undergoes mRNA editing only in GluR2 to produce an Arg residue that regulates channel rectification and ion permeability (Sommer et al., 1991Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. RNA editing in brain controls a determinant of ion flow in glutamate-gated channels.Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of this site to type II TARP modulation of GluR2, we mutated this residue in GluR2 to Gln (Q). Strikingly, we found that the enhancing effects of γ-5 on both the glutamate-evoked peak current and CTZ-enhanced maximal current were eliminated in GluR2Q (Figure 3). In addition, γ-7 enhanced only the steady-state currents of GluR2Q, and γ-7 had no effect on peak currents in the absence or presence of CTZ. In contrast, γ-2 modulation of glutamate-evoked peak, steady-state, and CTZ-enhanced currents was unaffected by the Gln mutation (Figure 3). To evaluate further the dependence of γ-5 effects on Q/R editing, we constructed an unnatural R-form of the flip splice variant of GluR1. Similar to its effects on GluR2iR, γ-5 enhanced glutamate-evoked peak and steady-state currents through GluR1iR, as well as the currents evoked by glutamate in the presence of CTZ. Furthermore, γ-5 reduced by 7-fold the potency of glutamate for GluR1iR (Figure S3). Quantitatively, all TARPs tested here showed larger increases of GluR2R-mediated currents as compared to GluR2Q receptors (Figure 3). This preferential effect of TARPs on R-forms is also observed in GluR1iR (Figure S3). As virtually all GluR2 subunits, but no other AMPA receptor subunits are edited at the Q/R site (Sommer et al., 1991Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. RNA editing in brain controls a determinant of ion flow in glutamate-gated channels.Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), these data suggest that only neuronal receptors containing the GluR2 subunit would be enhanced by γ-5. The preceding results demonstrate that γ-5 uniquely modulates GluR2 by enhancing peak currents and suppressing steady-state responses. A hallmark of type I TARPs is their ability to slow AMPA receptor gating by modulating the deactivation and/or desensitization processes of these ion channels. To determine the extent to which γ-5 modulates these biophysical processes, we compared the effects of coexpression of γ-2 or γ-5 on deactivation and desensitization of GluR2. To evaluate the effects of these two TARPs on deactivation, we used ultrafast perfusion of 1 ms pulses of glutamate to outside-out patches (Figure 4A). Because GluR2 subunits show very small channel conductances (Swanson et al., 1997Swanson G.T. Kamboj S.K. Cull-Candy S.G. Single-channel properties of recombinant AMPA receptors depend on RNA editing, splice variation, and subunit composition.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 58-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we could not detect glutamate-evoked currents in patches from cells transfected with GluR2R alone (data not shown). However, cotransfection with GluR2R with either γ-5 or γ-2 yielded readily detectable currents. Results showed that the deactivation rates of these currents were significantly faster in cells transfected with γ-5 as compared to γ-2 (Figures 4A and 4C). To evaluate desensitization we used ultrafast application of glutamate to isolated cells, which allowed detection of currents from GluR2iR transfectants. We found that γ-2 slowed the desensitization of GluR2iR (Figures 4B and 4D), but to a lesser extent than seen previously with GluR1i (Tomita et al., 2005Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin modulates AMPA receptor gating and trafficking by distinct domains.Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). By contrast, γ-5 accelerated the desensitization rate of GluR2iR currents (Figures 4B and 4D). Furthermore, γ-2 enhanced steady-state currents from GluR2i(R), whereas γ-5 nearly abolished these currents (Figure 4E). In an attempt to confirm that endogenously expressed γ-5 can influence the function of native AMPA receptors, we took advantage of the selective expression of γ-5 in the CA2, but not the CA1 or CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (Figure 4F; Fukaya et al., 2005Fukaya M. Yamazaki M. Sakimura K. Watanabe M. Spatial diversity in gene expression for VDCCgamma subunit family in developing and adult mouse brains.Neurosci. Res. 2005; 53: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar). We assessed AMPA receptor-mediated desensitization in acutely isolated CA2 and CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neuron using ultrafast glutamate application. Results showed that the rate of desensitization of AMPA-receptor-mediated currents from CA2 neurons was significantly faster than that from CA3 neurons (Figures 4G and 4H). In addition the extent of desensitization was greater in CA2 neurons than CA3 neurons, as revealed by a lower steady-state to peak current ratio (Figures 4G and 4I). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that γ-5 can uniquely modulate the biophysical properties of native neuronal AMPA receptors. Previous studies showed that type I TARPs increase the affinity of GluR1 receptors for glutamate, whereas γ-7 does not alter agonist affinity (Kato et al., 2007Kato A.S. Zhou W. Milstein A.D. Knierman M.D. Siuda E.R. Dotzlaf J.E. Yu H. Hale J.E. Nisenbaum E.S. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. New transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein isoform, gamma-7, differentially regulates AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4969-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here, similar to the effects of γ-7, the present results showed that γ-5 had no effect on glutamate affinity for GluR1 (Figure 5). However, for GluR2, γ-5 lowered the glutamate affinity by ∼10-fold, and this effect was restricted to the edited form of GluR2(R) (Figure 5). Evaluation of GluR1/2 heteromers revealed that γ-5 had an intermediate effect, producing ∼3-fold rightward shift in glutamate affinity. To confirm that our GluR1 and GluR2 cotransfectants formed heteromeric receptors, we assessed channel rectification. As shown in Figure S4, GluR1/2 and GluR2/3 cotransfectants showed similar rectification indices to GluR2 homomers, which is consistent with the dominant influence of GluR2 on heteromeric receptor rectification (Hollmann et al., 1991Hollmann M.

RNA editing in brain controls a determinant of ion flow in glutamate-gated channels.Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that γ-2 enhances surface expression of AMPA receptors in both neurons and nonneuronal cells (Tomita et al., 2005Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R.

In COS cells, trafficking by γ-2 can be quantified by staining transfected cells for an extracellular epitope on GluR1 both before and after plasma"

Impaired keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation are key elements in the pathophysiology of several important dermatological diseases, including atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

Our skin undergoes constant regulation to provide a protective epithelial barrier, whereby the differentiation of keratinocytes from proliferating cells in the basal layer into platted, dead cells in the stratum corneum plays a major role. Keratinocytes leaving the basal layer not only change structure and shape but also loose their ability to proliferate and enter the terminal differentiation stage by expressing proteins required for the cornification like keratin 1 (K1) 2The abbreviations used are: K1, keratin 1; K10, keratin 10; IVL, involucrin; AD, atopic dermatitis; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; TRPV, vanilloid-like transient potential channel; hPK, human primary keratinocytes; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RNAi, RNA interference; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: K1, keratin 1; K10, keratin 10; IVL, involucrin; AD, atopic dermatitis; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; TRPV, vanilloid-like transient potential channel; hPK, human primary keratinocytes; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RNAi, RNA interference; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. or keratin 10 (K10) and additional structural proteins that are needed for the cornification such as involucrin (IVL) or transglutaminase (1Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The precise balance between proliferation and differentiation found in healthy individuals is altered in individuals suffering from various skin diseases like psoriasis or atopic dermatitis (AD). Psoriasis is marked by thickened epidermis because of increased proliferation but disturbed differentiation of keratinocytes (2Lowes M.A. Bowcock A.M. Krueger J.G. Nature. 2007; 445: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Accordingly, psoriatic skin is characterized by reduced differentiation markers but elevated epidermal proliferation markers (3Bovenschen H.J. Seyger M.M. Van De Kerkhof P.C. Br. J. Dermatol. 2005; 153: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Psoriatic plaques are covered by a thick layer of scales caused by aberrant terminal differentiation. The granular layer of the epidermis, in which the terminal differentiation begins, is greatly reduced or absent in psoriatic lesions, which results in a stratum corneum consisting of incompletely differentiated keratinocytes. As for psoriasis, the exact pathomechanisms of AD are not known (4Williams H.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 2314-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition to an enhanced immune response, a reduced integrity of the epidermal barrier seems to be relevant. Proksch et al. (5Proksch E. Folster-Holst R. Jensen J.M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2006; 43: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) suggested that a disturbed differentiation of keratinocytes causes a defective skin barrier function in AD, enabling the enhanced penetration of environmental allergens. An impaired expression of cornified envelope proteins like involucrin and keratins like K10, important for permeability barrier formation, could also be detected in lesional skin from patients with AD (6Jensen J.M. Folster-Holst R. Baranowsky A. Schunck M. Winoto-Morbach S. Neumann C. Schutze S. Proksch E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, other factors not directly related to keratinocyte function seem to contribute to the altered skin barrier seen in AD patients, e.g. a mutation in the structural protein filaggrin (7Palmer C.N. Irvine A.D. Terron-Kwiatkowski A. Zhao Y. Liao H. Lee S.P. Goudie D.R. Sandilands A. Campbell L.E. Smith F.J. O'Regan G.M. Watson R.M. Cecil J.E. Bale S.J. Compton J.G. DiGiovanna J.J. Fleckman P. Lewis-Jones S. Arseculeratne G. Sergeant A. Munro C.S. El Houate B. McElreavey K. Halkjaer L.B. Bisgaard H. Mukhopadhyay S. McLean W.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). Because of the crucial role of keratinocyte differentiation for normal skin function and as relevant pathomechanism in various skin diseases, an exact knowledge of the mechanism relevant for the specific and tight sequence of events leading to keratinocytes proliferation and differentiation is very much needed. On a cellular level, several studies clearly showed that Ca2+ plays a crucial role in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation especially for the terminal stages like cell stratification and cornification (8Tu C.L. Oda Y. Komuves L. Bikle D.D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Induction of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation are tightly regulated by an increase in [Ca2+]i because of both Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx mechanisms with a still unknown molecular basis. In tissue culture, the differentiation of keratinocytes can be triggered by experimentally increasing [Ca2+]o above 0.1 mm (9Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In a first step, this elevation in [Ca2+]o induces a rise in [Ca2+]i by activating the Ca2+-sensing receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (10Tu C.L. Chang W. Bikle D.D. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 1074-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the next step, stimulation of the Ca2+-sensing receptor activates the phospholipase C pathway generating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (8Tu C.L. Oda Y. Komuves L. Bikle D.D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Both intracellular second messengers elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate as a ligand of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors induces the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. Diacylglycerol directly activates members of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel family. Based on the sequence homology, activation mechanism, and ability to form heteromeric channel complexes, the proteins of the TRPC group can be divided into the TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 and the TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7, of which diacylglycerol directly activates only TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 (11Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). However, the data about the specific TRPC channels relevant for keratinocyte differentiation are controversial. For example Cai et al. (12Cai S.W. Fatherazi S. Presland R.B. Belton C.M. Izutsu K.T. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2005; 40: 21-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) detected TRPC1, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7 in gingival keratinocytes, whereas Beck et al. (13Beck B. Zholos A. Sydorenko V. Roudbaraki M. Lehen'kyi V. Bordat P. Prevarskaya N. Skryma R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 1982-1993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed the expression of TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC7 in HaCaT keratinocytes. Similarly, TRPC1 as well as TRCP4 have been implicated in the Ca2+-sensing receptor triggered elevation of [Ca2+]i (14Cai S. Fatherazi S. Presland R.B. Belton C.M. Roberts F.A. Goodwin P.C. Schubert M.M. Izutsu K.T. Pflúgers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 452: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Fatherazi S. Presland R.B. Belton C.M. Goodwin P. Al Qutub M. Trbic Z. Macdonald G. Schubert M.M. Izutsu K.T. Pflúgers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 453: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, following Ca2+-stimulated differentiation of gingival keratinocytes, elevated expression of TRPC1, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7 has been reported (12Cai S.W. Fatherazi S. Presland R.B. Belton C.M. Izutsu K.T. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2005; 40: 21-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The attempts to identify the Ca2+ channels playing the major role for Ca2+-sensing receptor-mediated keratinocyte differentiation have been significantly hampered by the lack of pharmacological tools specifically affecting individual TRPC channel function. However, because we have recently identified hyperforin as a specific and potent TRPC6 activator (16Leuner K. Kazanski V. Múller M. Essin K. Henke B. Gollasch M. Harteneck C. Múller W.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 4101-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Treiber K. Singer A. Henke B. Múller W.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 145: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we were able for the first time to investigate in detail the specific contribution of this channel for Ca2+-mediated keratinocyte differentiation. Our findings not only show that TRPC6 plays a role but also demonstrate that the specific activation of TRPC6 alone is sufficient for nearly full physiological response. TRPC6 activation by hyperforin or similar compounds therefore represents a novel approach to pharmacologically activated keratinocyte differentiation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism for keratinocyte differentiation in culture, we used HaCaT cells as established and characterized cell model and human primary keratinocytes (hPKs) and human skin explants as native systems to validate our data. By this approach, we were able to show that both cell types express functionally active TRPC6 channels in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, the use of hyperforin, the recently identified selective activator of TRPC6, enabled us to show that the Ca2+-induced differentiation of keratinocytes is to a large extent mediated by TRPC6 channels. The elucidation of this molecular pathway has several clinical implications. First, the TRPC6 gene is an interesting candidate gene for genetic approaches, and second stimulating TRPC6 channels may be a novel treatment approach in dermatology. Sources and Preparation of Reagents—Hyperforin was a kind gift from Dr. Willmar Schwabe (Karlsruhe, Germany). Fluorescence dyes (SBFI-AM and fura-2-AM) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Pluronic F-127, 2-aminophenoxyborate (Tocris, Abvonmouth, UK), and SK&F 96365 (Biotrend, Cologne, Germany) were used from 10 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used from 50 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. GdCl3 and LaCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in H2O prior to experiments. Cell Culture—The HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line was cultured in keratinocyte-SFM medium (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 units/ml penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Human primary keratinocytes were derived from adult skin and cultured according to the method of Rheinwald and Green (18Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 317-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) in keratinocyte growth medium (Promo Cell, Heidelberg, Germany). HaCaT cells and hPKs were cultured under a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. For the experiments, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates for RT-PCR and Western blot and on glass coverslips for histochemistry and Ca2+ imaging. For differentiation studies, the cells were allowed to attach for 24 h after trypsinization, and then 0.1 mm Ca2+-containing keratinocyte-SFM medium was replaced by SFM medium with 2 mm Ca2+ or hyperforin 1 μm. After 48–72 h of incubation in the latter medium, histochemical staining, RT-PCR, and Western blotting of corresponding markers were performed. Split Thickness Skin Organ Culture—6-mm punch biopsies containing epidermis and papillary dermis were obtained from dermatome-separated human skin. The biopsies were floated on SFM in six-well plates in the presence of Ca2+-free medium (negative control), 2 mm Ca2+ (positive control), or 1 μm hyperforin. After 24 h the cultures were terminated, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. 3-μm sections were stained for TRPC6 using the labeled streptavidin biotin method as described (19Schempp C.M.

Five random fields of sections from four independent skin explants were counted for TRPC6-positive keratinocytes at ×400 magnification. The final count/group represents the mean ± S.D. Cell Transfection—HaCaT keratinocytes and hPKs were plated in 6-well plates onto glass coverslips and transiently transfected 24 h later by the addition of a transfection mixture containing 0.5 μg of DNA and 1 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in 97 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). The cDNA constructs have been kindly provided by Dr. Michel Schaefer (11Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Ca2+ imaging was conducted 2 days after transfection. Histochemical staining, RT-PCR, and Western blotting were conducted 2–3 days after transfection. For TRPC knockdown studies with siRNA, HaCaT cells were plated in 6-well plates onto glass coverslips and transiently transfected 24 h later by the addition of transfection mixture containing 100 nm TRPC6 siRNA (Invitrogen) or 25 nm TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC7 siRNA (Ambion) and 2.5 μg/ml Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 250 μl of Opti-MEM medium. As a control 100 nm siRNA control sequence with low GC content (Invitrogen) or 25 nm negative RNAi control (Ambion) with their complementary sequences were transfected in the same procedure. Histochemical staining and Western blotting were performed 2–3 days after transfection. RT-PCR—RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), chloroform, and 100% ethanol according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were carried out using 2 μg of mRNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl final volume using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). After reverse transcription, amplification was carried out by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase and dNTP set of Invitrogen. A 2-μl aliquot of the reverse transcription solution was used as a template for specific PCR. The PCR primers used to amplify TRPC1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 channels, IVL, TGM I, K1, and K10 cDNAs are specified in Table 1. Commercially available 18 S rRNA primers (Ambion, Huntington, UK) were used as internal loading control, and the predicted 18 S (Classic II) band size was 324 bp. The PCR was conducted under the following conditions: an initial denaturation step at a temperature of 94 °C for 5 min and 30 cycles as follows: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and finally 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Changes in relative mRNA levels were obtained by relating each PCR product to its internal control. After gel electrophoresis, quantification was archived with Easywin 32 software (Herolab). RT-PCR analysis using TRPC6-specific primer resulted in a fragment of the expected size of 322 bp. The sequence of fragment was sequenced (Seqlab, Göttingen, Germany) and corresponded to the TRPC6 sequence available in GenBank™ under accession number AF080394.TABLE 1Primer and siRNA sequencesNo.NameAccession no.Forward (5′ → 3′)Backward (5′ → 3′)Expected sizebp1K1NM_006112GGACATGGTGGAGGATTACCGTGCTCTTCTGGGCTATATCCTCG3162K10NM_000421GCAAAATCAAGGAGCGGTATGAGAGCTGCACACAGTAGCGACC6853IVLNM_005547TCTAAGATGTCCCAGCAACACATCATGCTGTTCCCAGTGCTGTT2924TGM INM_000359GATCGCATCACCCTTGAGTTACTCCTCATGGTCCACGTACACAAT3045TRPC1Z73903ATGTATACAACCAGCTCTATCTTGAGTCTTTGGTGAGGGAATGATG5256TRPC3U47050CTGCAAATGAGAGCTTTGGCAACTTCCATTCTACATCACTGTC3887TRPC4AF175406ATTCATATACTGCCTTGTGTTGGGTCAGCAATCAGTTGGTAAG3298TRPC5AF054568ACTTCTATTATGAAACCAGAGCGCATGATCGGCAATAAGCTG2899TRPC6AF080394AAGACATCTTCAAGTTCATGGTCTCAGCGTCATCCTCAATTTCC32210TRPC7AJ272034GTCCGAATGCAAGGAAATCTTGGGTTGTATTTGGCACCTC47711TRPC1 siRNA5′-GAUCUGUCAAAAUUCCGAATT-3′5′-UUCGGAAUUUUGACAGAUCTT-3′12TRPC3 siRNA5′-CGUUAUCAGCAGAUAAUGATT-3′5′-UCAUUAUCUGCUGAUAACGTG-3′13TRPC4 siRNA5′-GUAUAGACUAUGAUCUAAATT-3′5′-UUUAGAUCAUAGUCUAUACTA-3′14TRPC5 siRNA5′-CACCCUGAUUCAUCCGAGATT-3′5′-UCUCGGAUGAAUCAGGGUGGT-3′15TRPC6 siRNA 15′-UCUCUCCAUUUGGUAUGAGAAUCUU-3′5′-AAGAUUCUCAUACCAAUGGAGAGA-3′16TRPC6 siRNA 25′-CCCAAGGAAUAUUUGUUUGAGUUGA-3′5′-ACAACUCAAACAAAUAUUCCUUGGG-3′17TRPC6 siRNA 35′-GGAGCUCAGAAGAUUUCCAUCUAAA-3′5′-UUUAGAUGGAAAUCUUCUGAGCUCC-3′18TRPC7 siRNA5′-CCAUAUUCGGCUUAUCUGAAGUAAU-3′5′-AUUACUUCAGAUAAGCCCGAAUAUGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Western Blotting—HaCaT cells and hPKs were harvested by centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min, room temperature). The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and homogenized by shearing through 26-gauge needles. After removal of nuclei (800 × g, 2 min, 4 C), the supernatants were mixed with gel loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris/HCl, 10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with a blocking solution (Invitrogen) for 2 h and overnight and then probed with using specific rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPC6 (Chemicon, 1/300), mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 1/10 (Chemicon, 1/200), and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Chemicon, 1/300). The antibodies were visualized by incubation with horseradish antibody conjugate. To calculate the ratio between TRPC6, cytokeratin 1/10 and GAPDH band intensities we used Image J. Histochemistry—HaCaT cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with Mayer's hematoxylin and eosin solutions. Morphological changes were analyzed by using Nikon NIS Elements AR 2.1 software. For cytospin experiments, subconfluent hPKs were incubated with SFM containing Ca2+-free medium (negative control), 2 mm Ca2+ (positive control), or 1 μm hyperforin. After 24 h the cells were trypsinized, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged onto coated microscope slides using a cytospin centrifuge (Thermo Shandon, UK). The cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde. Subsequently the cells were stained for TRPC6 using the labeled streptavidin biotin method according to the manufacturer's instruction (DCS, Hannover, Germany). The primary polyclonal TRPC6 antibody (Chemicon) and the secondary biotinylated multi-link antibody (Dako, Denmark) were used at a dilution of 1:200. Fluorescence Measurements—The intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i, barium [Ba2+]i, strontium [Sr2+]i, and sodium [Na+]i measurements in single cells were carried out using the fluorescence indicators fura-2-AM or SBFI-AM in combination with a monochromator-based imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Martinsried, Germany or Attofluor Ratio Vision System) attached to an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For [Ca2+]i measurements HaCaT cells and hPKs were loaded with 4 μm fura-2-AM (Invitrogen) and 0.01% Pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature in a standard solution composed of 138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). The coverslips were then washed in this buffer for 20 min and mounted in a perfusion chamber on the microscope stage. To measure Ba2+ and Sr2+ influx, the cells were incubated with Ca2+-free standard solution. The influx of Ba2+ and Sr2+ in HaCaT cells was evaluated in fura-2-loaded cells by measuring the fluorescence of Ba2+/Sr2+ fura complexes. [Na+]i concentration was measured by incubating HaCaT cells with the fluorescence dye SBFI-AM (10 μm) and 0.01% Pluronic F-127 for 40 min at room temperature in a sodium-free medium (3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl, 5 mm Tris, 10 mm glucose; the sodium replaced by an equimolar amount of sucrose; pH adjusted with HCl to 7.4). After washing out the fluorescence dye, sodium-containing medium (140 mm Na+) was added. For all of the fluorescence experiments, fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm. After correction for background fluorescence, the fluorescence ratio F340/F380 was calculated. In all of the experiments, transfected cells (5–10 cells) of the whole field of vision were identified by their YFP fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. Electrophysiology—Currents in HaCaT cells were recorded in the perforated patch configuration with amphotericin B. The experiments were performed at room temperature using a Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes of 3–5 MOhm were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries. The bath solution consisted of 6 mm KCl, 134 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm d-Glucose, 40 mm d-mannitol (pH 7.4, NaOH). The pipette solution contained 134 mm Cs-MES, 6 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, CsOH). Amphotericin B (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted into the pipette solution to give a final concentration of 250 μg/ml. Perforation started shortly after seal formation and reached a steady-state level within 5–10 min. The currents were recorded from holding potentials of –40 mV during linear voltage ramps at 0.67 V/s from –100 mV to +100 mV applied each 15 s. The average capacitance of the cells was 30.7 ± 1.4 pF (n = 39). Patch pipettes of 3–5 MΩ were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries. The experiments were analyzed using Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Proliferation Measurement—Quantification of cell proliferation was determined by a nonisotopic immunoassay kit (Calbiochem, Germany), based on the measurement of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation during DNA synthesis. The assay was carried out according to the product instruction manual. MTT Assay—Estimation of cytotoxicity of hyperforin on cell viability was determined by means of MTT assay, on HaCaT keratinocytes grown on 96-well plates, after 48 h of treatment. According to the manufacturing instructions (Roche Applied Science), MTT reagent was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Incubation was continued for another 2 h, and the formazan crystals were then solubilized by 100 μl of a 20% SDS/50% N,N-dimethyl-formamide solution. After complete 12 h of solubilization, the absorption was measured at 550 nm with a correction wavelength of 620 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay micro plate reader. Statistics—In addition to Microsoft Office Excel, GraphPad PRISM™ (version 3.0) was used for statistical analyses and to create the graphs. For statistical analyses, an unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed) was used. The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Hyperforin Induces Differentiation in HaCaT Keratinocytes—Because of the unclear situation of TRPC channels expressed in keratinocytes, we performed RT-PCR analyses from RNA extracted from primary keratinocytes and HaCaT cells. The detection of TRPC6-encoding mRNA in both cell types provided the rationale to use hyperforin as pharmacological tools to unravel the mechanism of keratinocyte differentiation induced by high (2 mm) extracellular calcium (high [Ca2+]o), which has been shown to be an endogenous trigger (1Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 20Bikle D.D. Ratnam A. Mauro T. Harris J. Pillai S. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the initial experimental set up, we compared cell morphology as read out in hyperforin-treated cells and cells exposed to high [Ca2+]o (Fig. 1A). Control HaCaT keratinocytes and hPKs are predominantly polygon-shaped, with clear boundaries and a large nucleus/cytoplasm ratio (Fig. 1A, left panel). After a period of 3 days in the presence of high [Ca2+]o, the cells undergo visible morphological changes, from large and flat to closely associated, elongated cells with spider web morphology (Fig. 1A, middle panel). As shown in Fig. 1A (right panel) for HaCaT cells, hyperforin induced morphological changes in HaCaT and hPK cells (data not shown), which are comparable with the morphology of cells cultured in the presence of high [Ca2+]o (compare middle and right panels). To test whether or not these morphological changes can also be detected by biochemical methods, we analyzed protein extracts of hyperforin- and high [Ca2+]o-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Western blot analyses revealed that HaCaT and hPK cells express basal levels of K1 and K10 being up-regulated during high [Ca2+]o or hyperforin treatment. K1 and K10 represent early differentiation markers, whereas IVL or transglutaminase I are late markers of keratinocyte differentiation. Using RT-PCR, we analyzed early and late differentiation markers in HaCaT (Fig. 1C) and hPK (Fig. 1D) cells. As shown in Fig. 1C low K1, K10, as well as IVL and TGM1 mRNA concentrations were detected in medium containing 0.1 mm Ca2+, whereas their mRNA levels were increased in cells cultured in the presence of either high [Ca2+]o or hyperforin. Quantification of the RT-PCR signals obtained from mRNA extracted from HaCaT (Fig. 1E) and hPKs (Fig. 1F) by normalization clearly show that incubation in the presence of high [Ca2+]o as well as hyperforin increased the transcription of early and late keratinocyte differentiation markers. Hyperforin Inhibits Proliferation in HaCaT Keratinocytes—In addition to differentiation, proliferation of keratinocytes is also controlled by intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, we performed proliferation measurements with the bromodeoxyuridine immunoassay kit (Chemicon). Synchronized HaCaT keratinocytes incubated with high [Ca2+]o for 3 days showed significantly reduced proliferation (Fig. 2A). Notably, hyperforin (1 μm) also inhibited the proliferation of keratinocytes, as shown in Fig. 2A. To confirm these findings, we analyzed the expression of the nuclear proliferation marker protein Ki-67 by Western blotting. Ki-67 is expressed in cells undergoing the S/G2/M transition and serves as a well established marker to determine proliferating cells (21Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, protein expression of Ki-67 is similarly reduced in HaCaT cells treated either with hyperforin or high [Ca2+]o. To exclude toxic effects induced by hyperforin, we performed MTT assay ("

OAT1 and OAT3 are predominantly expressed at the basolateral membrane of kidney proximal tubule cells and the apical membrane of brain choroid plexus. OAT4 is expressed at the apical membrane of kidney proximal tubule cells and the basolateral membrane of placental trophoblast. OAT2 is expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and is expressed in the kidney. The cellular localization of OAT2 in the kidney is still controversial. OAT5 is expressed only in the kidney. OAT6 is expressed in the olfactory mucosa, and OAT7 was identified in the liver. The cellular localization of OAT5–7 has not been defined. In the kidney, OAT1 and OAT3 utilize a tertiary transport mechanism to move organic anions across the basolateral membrane into the proximal tubule cells for subsequent exit across the apical membrane into the urine for elimination. Through this tertiary transport mechanism, Na+/K+-ATPase maintains an inwardly directed (blood-to-cell) Na+ gradient. The Na+ gradient then drives a sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter, sustaining an outwardly directed dicarboxylate gradient that is utilized by a dicarboxylate/organic anion exchanger, namely OAT, to move the organic anion substrate into the cell. This cascade of events indirectly links organic anion transport to metabolic energy and the Na+ gradient, allowing the entry of a negatively charged substrate against both its chemical concentration gradient and the electrical potential of the cell. All of the cloned OATs share several common structural features (4Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol.

Recent investigation from our laboratory on the structure-function relationship of OATs revealed that glycosylation is necessary for the targeting of these transporters to the plasma membrane (17Tanaka K.

There are several mechanisms by which PKC could modulate OAT activity. PKC-induced direct phosphorylation has been reported for other membrane proteins (30Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Li D. Cheng S.X.J. Fisone G. Caplan M.J. Ohtomo Y. Aperia A.E. Am. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15541-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether PKC activation inhibited OAT activity through direct phosphorylation of the transporter. Our previous results showed (29You G. Kuze K. Kohanski R.A. Amsler K. Handerson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10278-10284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that PMA and other PKC activators failed to elevate the phosphorylation level of OAT1 under various experimental conditions. This suggests that direct phosphorylation is unlikely to be the cause for PKC-induced inhibition of OAT1 activity. This was further confirmed by Wolff et al. (23Wolff N.A. Thies K. Kuhnke N. Reid G. Friedrich B. Lang F. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showing that PKC-induced inhibition of OAT1 activity is independent of the conserved canonical PKC consensus sites in OAT1. Alternatively, PKC activation may induce an internalization of membrane transporters and/or inhibit the recruitment of preformed transporters into plasma membrane (a “trafficking” mechanism). Certain plasma membrane proteins are static in the cell surface but internalize only in response to activated cellular signaling. For example, G-protein-coupled receptors exhibit very little basal internalization, but rapidly internalize during agonist-induced desensitization (33Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 34Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, GLUT4, the predominant glucose transporter of muscle and adipose cells, recycles constitutively between the cell surface and intracellular compartments, with the steady-state distribution favoring the latter. Insulin shifts the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 resulting in a new steady state where a large fraction of GLUT4 residues at the plasma membrane. This shift occurs primarily through the stimulation of GLUT4 recycling without significant inhibition of GLUT4 internalization (35Tremblay F. Dubois M.J. Marette A. Front.

For example, brain dopamine transporter and Na+/H+ exchanger constitutively traffic but are retained intracellularly by accelerating internalization and attenuating recycling in response to PKC activation (36Loder M.K.

In the present studies, we examined (i) whether OAT1 undergoes constitutive trafficking between cell surface and intracellular compartments, (ii) whether PKC-modulated inhibition of OAT1 activity occurs by altering the trafficking of this transporter, and (iii) the pathway through which OAT1 traffics. p-[3H]Aminohippuric acid (PAH) was from NEN Life Science Products (Hercules, CA). Membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent NHS-SS-biotin and streptavidin-agarose beads were purchased from Pierce. COS-7 cells and Dynamin-2/K44A mutant were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Eps15 mutant (D95/295) was generously provided by Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz from NICHD, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) was from Hybridoma Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine (New York, NY). Mouse anti-EEA1 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Transferrin-tetramethylrhodamine conjugate, Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), and Alexa Fluor® 350 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Protease inhibitor mixture, rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Generation of COS-7 Cells Stably Expressing OAT1—Parental COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and glucose (100 mg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at 5 × 105/well of 6-well cluster plate 24 h before transfection. cDNA plasmid encoding human OAT1-tagged with myc at its C terminus (38Hong M. Xu W. Yoshida T. Tanaka K. Zhou F. Inouye M. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32285-32290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was transfected into COS-7 cells using a Lipofectamine 2000 reagent, following the manufacturer's instruction. After 7–8 days of selection in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen), resistant colonies were replated to 96 wells for cloning, expansion, and analyzing positive clones. Transport Measurements—For each well, uptake solution was added. The uptake solution consisted of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/CM (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) and [3H]PAH (20 μm). At the time points indicated in the figure legends, the uptake was stopped by aspirating the uptake solution off and rapidly washing the cells with ice-cold PBS solution. The cells were then solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH, neutralized in 0.2 n HCl, and aliquotted for liquid scintillation counting. The uptake count was standardized by the amount of protein in each well. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface expression level of OAT1 was examined using the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, NHS-SS-biotin. Cells were plated in 6-well plates. Each well of cells was incubated with 1 ml of NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml in PBS/CM) in two successive 20-min incubations on ice with very gentle shaking. The reagent was freshly prepared for each incubation. After biotinylation, each well was briefly rinsed with 3 ml of PBS/CM containing 100 mm glycine then incubated with the same solution for 30 min on ice, to ensure complete quenching of the unreacted NHS-SS-biotin. The cells were then dissolved on ice for 1 h in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 with 1/100 protease inhibitor mixture). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads was then added to the supernatant to isolate cell membrane proteins. OAT1 was detected in the pool of surface proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Internalization Assay—We followed the procedure described by Loder et al. (36Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and Zhao et al. (59Zhao Z. Li X. Hao J. Winston J.H. Weinman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29022-29031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). OAT1-expressing cells underwent biotinylation with 1.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at 4 °C. Following biotinylation, one set of cells was washed with PBS and kept at 4 °C to determine the total initial surface OAT1 and stripping efficiencies. To initiate internalization, cells in the duplicate plate were washed repeatedly with prewarmed (37 °C) PBS containing either 1 μm PMA or vehicle and incubated with the same solutions for 5, 10, 15, and 30 min at 37 °C. Residual cell surface biotin was stripped by incubating cells three times for 20 min with freshly prepared 50 mm MesNa in NT buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.6). Stripping efficiency was determined for each experiment on biotinylated cells kept in parallel at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture. Biotinylated proteins were separated from non-biotinylated proteins by streptavidin pull down from equivalent amounts of cellular proteins, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Relative OAT1 internalized was calculated as % of the total initial cell surface OAT1 pool. Recycling Assay—We followed the procedure described by Loder et al. (36Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and Zhao et al. (59Zhao Z. Li X. Hao J. Winston J.H. Weinman S.A. J. Biol.

OAT1-expressing cells underwent biotinylation with 1.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at 4 °C for 30 min to label cell surface pool of OAT1. Subsequently, one set of cells was continuously biotinylated at 4 °C. Cells in the duplicate plate were warmed to 37 °C and continuously biotinylated at 37 °C. At the time points indicated in the figures, biotinylation was stopped and biotin-labeled OAT1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Relative OAT1 recycled was calculated as the difference between OAT1 biotin-labeled at 37 °C and OAT1 biotin-labeled at 4 °C. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein samples (100 μg) were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE minigels and electroblotted on to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-0.05% Tween 20, washed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The signals were detected by SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce). Nonsaturating, immunoreactive protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry with the FluorChem 8000 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Immunofluorescence Analysis—OAT1-expressing COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips (22 mm) for 24 h, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with 1 μm transferrin-tetramethylrhodamine conjugate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 4 °C for 1 h to allow the binding of transferrin to transferrin receptor, followed by incubation at 37 °C to allow the internalization of transferrin-transferrin receptor complex. The cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 5 min three times, and incubated with 5% dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. Afterward, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody (1:300) to label c-myc hOAT1 and with mouse anti-EEA1 antibody (1:250) at 4 °C overnight. The coverslips were then incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:500) or Alexa Fluor® 350 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:500) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides for image acquisition and analysis. Samples were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Data Analysis—Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. The statistical analysis was from multiple experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Characterization of OAT1 in COS-7 Cells—To study the mechanisms underlying regulation of OAT1-mediated drug transport, we established COS-7 cells stably expressing OAT1. The OAT1-mediated transport of PAH, a protypical organic anion, across the cell membrane was saturable (Fig. 1a). Based on Eadie-Hofstee plot analysis (Fig. 1a, inset), the Km value for PAH was 112.7 μm and Vmax was 1070 pmol/mg/3 min. Given the many reports that OAT1 activity was down-regulated by activation of PKC in transfected cells and in kidney proximal tubules (19Miller D.S. Am. J.

After treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, at 1 μm for 30 min, we observed a significant decrease in OAT1-mediated PAH transport (Fig. 1b). The inhibition of OAT1 activity by PMA was due to a decrease in the maximum transport velocity Vmax without significant change in the substrate affinity Km (not shown). These results demonstrate that OAT1 in COS-7 cells exhibits all the functional hallmarks of OAT1 as reported in other cell systems (19Miller D.S. Am. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10278-10284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and that OAT1-COS-7 cells are well suited for studying the regulation of this transporter. PKC-induced Cellular Redistribution of OAT1—A decrease in the Vmax of PAH transport in response to PKC activation by PMA may reflect either a decrease in transporter density at the cell surface or a decrease in transport turnover rates. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used cell surface biotinylation approach to examine the cellular distribution of OAT1 in cells treated with or without PMA. We showed (Fig. 2) that treatment of COS-7 cells with PMA resulted in a decrease of OAT1 at the cell surface (Fig. 2a) with a concomitant increase of OAT1 in the intracellular compartments (Fig. 2b). Total OAT1 signals were not significantly changed after PMA treatment (Fig. 2c), suggesting that reduction in cell surface OAT1 is not caused by degradation. Therefore, activation of PKC results in a redistribution of OAT1 from the cell surface to intracellular compartments. The loss of OAT1 from the cell surface is responsible for the decrease in Vmax observed after PMA treatment. Constitutive OAT1 Trafficking—A sizable intracellular OAT1 pool under basal condition (Fig. 2b) suggests that OAT1 may be subject to constitutive internalization from and recycling back to the cell surface. To test this hypothesis, we took a biotinylation-based strategy. We first investigated whether OAT1 constitutively internalizes. OAT1-expressing COS-7 cells were biotinylated with cell-impermeable biotinylation reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin under trafficking-impermissive condition (4 °C). The labeled cells were then rewarmed back to trafficking-permissive condition (37 °C) to allow internalization to occur. At indicated time points after initiation of internalization, biotin from biotinylated proteins remaining on the surface was removed by treatment with MesNa, a nonpermeant reducing agent that cleaves disulfide bond and liberates biotin from biotinylated proteins at the cell surface. The amount of biotinylated proteins resistant (inaccessible) to MesNa treatment was defined as “the amount of protein internalized.” Our result (Fig. 3, a and c) showed that 0 min after initiation of internalization, there was no surface-labeled OAT1 internalized. However, 5, 10, or 15 min after initiation of internalization, ∼10%, 20%, or 30% of surface-labeled OAT1 was detectable in the intracellular compartments. Therefore, OAT1 undergoes constitutive internalization in COS-7 cells. Similar results were also observed in OAT1-expressing LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4, a and c), suggesting that OAT1 internalization is not cell type-specific, but is rather a general feature of this transporter.FIGURE 4Biotinylation analysis of constitutive OAT1 internalization in LLC-PK1 cells. a, OAT1 internalization was analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods” followed by Western blotting using anti-myc antibody (1:100). b, as a loading control for a, total expression of OAT1 in cell lysate was measured in parallel to experiments shown in a by Western blotting using anti-myc antibody (1:100). c, densitometry plot of results from a as well as from other experiments.

A low resolution crystal structure of yeast PDI described here reveals large scale conformational changes compared with the initially reported structure, indicating that PDI is a highly flexible molecule with its catalytic domains, a and a′, representing two mobile arms connected to a more rigid core composed of the b and b′ domains. Limited proteolysis revealed that the linker between the a domain and the core is more susceptible to degradation than that connecting the a′ domain to the core. By restricting the two arms with inter-domain disulfide bonds, the molecular flexibility of PDI, especially that of its a domain, was demonstrated to be essential for the enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo. The crystal structure also featured a PDI dimer, and a propensity to dimerize in solution and in the ER was confirmed by cross-linking experiments and the split green fluorescent protein system. Although sedimentation studies suggested that the self-association of PDI is weak, we hypothesize that PDI exists as an interconvertible mixture of monomers and dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum due to its high abundance in this compartment.

In the extracellular oxidative environment, intra- and inter-molecular disulfide bonds are utilized to maintain the tertiary or quarternary structure of most secreted proteins. The formation of the correct pattern of disulfide bonds is essential for the function of these proteins and, in turn, the viability of the cell. This process requires two major steps: oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines to form disulfide bonds and isomerization of mispaired disulfide bonds. In bacteria, two periplasmic enzymes catalyze these reactions, with DsbA being responsible for oxidation and DsbC for isomerization (reviewed in Ref. 1Nakamoto H. Bardwell J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, these processes occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; NGFP, N-terminal half of GFP; CGFP, C-terminal half of GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; EndoH, endoglycosidase H; sRNase, scrambled ribonuclease; rRNase, reduced ribonuclease. 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; NGFP, N-terminal half of GFP; CGFP, C-terminal half of GFP; HA, hemagglutinin; EndoH, endoglycosidase H; sRNase, scrambled ribonuclease; rRNase, reduced ribonuclease. and are catalyzed by a single enzyme, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). PDI is an abundant ER lumenal protein that is essential for cellular viability (2Farquhar R. Honey N. Murant S.J. Bossier P. Schultz L. Montgomery D. Ellis R.W. Freedman R.B. Tuite M.F.

Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). There are several PDI paralogs in humans (5Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and to a lesser extent also in yeast (6Norgaard P. Westphal V. Tachibana C. Alsoe L. Holst B. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but their detailed functions have not yet been determined.Yeast PDI is 522 amino acids in length and contains four thioredoxin-like domains, a, b, b′, and a′, followed by an acidic C-terminal extension (supplemental Fig. S1A) containing the ER-retention signal HDEL. The a and a′ domains each contain one active site, characterized by a Cys-Gly-His-Cys thioredoxin motif, which mediates the formation and rearrangement of protein disulfide bonds via oxidation/reduction reactions involving the two cysteine residues. The substrate binding site in mammalian PDI has been localized to the b′ domain (7Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 8Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J.

Besides catalyzing the formation of correct disulfide bonds, it has been reported that PDI also acts as a chaperone that can facilitate the folding of proteins that lack disulfide bonds (9Cai H. Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PDI constitutes the non-catalytic subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (10Koivu J. Myllyla R. Helaakoski T. Pihlajaniemi T. Tasanen K. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6447-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a subunit of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (11Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. Spinner S.N. Joiner B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9801-9807Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), however, its function as a component of these enzymes has not been fully defined.Recently we reported the crystal structure of full-length PDI from Saccharomyces cerevisiae deduced from crystals that were grown at 4 °C (12Tian G. Xiang S. Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Cell. 2006; 124: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). All four domains of yeast PDI were found to be structurally similar to thioredoxin and the acidic C-terminal extension was partially ordered. These four domains were found to be spatially organized in the shape of a twisted “U” with the a and a′ domains on the ends of the U and the b and b′ domains forming the base. The two active sites in the a and a′ domains face each other from a distance of ∼28 Å. A highly hydrophobic patch in the b′ domain is located between the two active sites, which, together with hydrophobic areas surrounding the active sites, form a continuous hydrophobic surface across the a, b′, and a′ domains. The domain arrangement, active site location, and surface features strikingly resemble the “V” shaped, homodimeric structure of DsbC (13McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), a functional homolog of PDI in Escherichia coli. In addition, the two active sites of PDI are structurally asymmetric in both redox state and accessibility, which mirrors their differential involvement in the activity of PDI in vitro (14Westphal V.

In this study, a distinct 3.7-Å resolution structure derived from a different crystal form of full-length PDI obtained at 22 °C is described.

After attempts with the intact molecule as the search model failed, the individual domains were used instead. The b, b′, and a′ domains could be easily located and appeared to be in a similar spatial arrangement as in the 4 °C structure. However, the a domain could only be located manually by fitting it into a region of significant difference density located near the N terminus of the b domain. The resulting model was carefully refined with REFMAC and the refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Secondary structure elements were defined with PROMOTIF (20Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) and figures were generated with PYMOL (21DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.

Cell. 2006; 124: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) point mutations were created using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Truncation mutants were prepared according to the domain boundaries as defined in Fig. S1A using a PCR cloning approach. All mutants were expressed and purified according to the protocol described for wild-type PDI. Enzymatic activity assays of PDI were carried out using either reduced or scrambled RNase (12Tian G. Xiang S. Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Cell. 2006; 124: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).Native PAGE and Ellmans Assay—Native PAGE was carried out as described (22Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2.

A mixture of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) was used as molecular mass marker for native PAGE. Ellmans assay was carried out using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce) except that glutathione was used instead of cysteine to generate the standard curve. The number of free -SH groups was calculated as the molar concentration of free -SH groups measured by Ellmans assay divided by the molar concentration of the protein.Strains and General Yeast Genetics—All strains prepared during this study are listed in Table 2. MLY200 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-1 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-1 his3-200 Δpdi1::HIS6 pRS316-PDI) (23LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J.

Standard synthetic defined medium containing specific drop-out amino acids mixtures (24Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) was used for growth of cells at 30 °C unless specified otherwise. Plasmid shuffling experiments were performed as described (25Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), and yeast transformations were carried out by the lithium acetate procedure, enhanced by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (26Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). The growth rates of yeast strains were evaluated by spotting 3 μl of serial 10-fold dilutions of yeast cells in early log phase (A600 less than 0.5) on synthetic defined agar plates lacking tryptophan. Plates supplemented with DTT were prepared by adding DTT to hot medium immediately before pouring. The plates were stored under N2 and used within 12 h.TABLE 2List of yeast strainsStrainsGenotypeMLY200MATa ura3-52 leu2-1 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-1 his3-200 Δpdi1::HIS6 pRS316-PDITG100MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDITG101MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI (E123C-S247C)TG102MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI (N306C-D441C)TG103MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI (E123C-S247C, N306C-D441C)TG106MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI-Myc3TG107MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS315-PDI-HA3TG108MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI-HA3 and pRS315-PDI-Myc3TG109MLY200 transformed by pRS402TG110TG109aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-GFP-PDITG111TG109aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-NGFP-PDI and pRS315-CGFP-PDITG112TG109aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI-NGFP and pRS315-CGFP-PDITG113TG109aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-NGFP-PDI and pRS315-PDI-CGFPTG114TG109aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI-NGFP and pRS315-PDI-CGFPTG115TG109aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI-NGFP and pRS315-PDI-CGFPTG116MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI (E123C)TG117MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI (S247C)TG118MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI (N306C)TG119MLY200aThe plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. transformed by pRS314-PDI (D441C)a The plasmid pRS316-PDI in the parent strain was replaced with the indicated plasmid(s) by the plasmid shuffle procedure. Open table in a new tab Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation of PDI-HA3 and PDI-Myc3—The C terminus of PDI was tagged with either a HA3 or Myc3 epitope using the pRS314 or pRS315 vectors, respectively. Microsomes from various strains were prepared from stationary phase cells using an established protocol (27Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12908-12917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but without reducing reagents and the sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation step. Cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidyl)propionate and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described (28Yan A. Ahmed E. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33078-33087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with either microsomes prepared from 250 A600 units of yeast cells or 2 mg/ml of PDI-HA3 and PDI-Myc3 purified from E. coli.Split GFP Construction and Measurement of GFP Reassembly—Residues 1 to 157 of GFP from pEGFP-C1 were used as the N-terminal half of GFP (NGFP) and residues 158 to 239 as the C-terminal half of GFP (CGFP). In the pRS314 and pRS315 vectors, respectively, NGFP and CGFP were attached to PDI either on the N terminus through a (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)2 linker, or on the C terminus through a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser linker. The pRS402 vector (29Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar), generously provided by Dr. Nancy Hollingsworth (Stony Brook University), was linearized with StuI and used to transform the MLY200 strain to generate strain TG109 that is devoid of autofluorescence. A set of strains co-expressing PDI tagged with NGFP and CGFP (TG111-114 in Table 2) were generated from TG109 by plasmid shuffling. The cells were grown at a low temperature, 15 °C, according to the reported protocol of the same technique in E. coli (30Wilson C.G. Magliery T.J. Regan L. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (31Nyfeler B. Michnick S.W. Hauri H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6350-6355Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). After 72 h of cell growth at 15 °C on synthetic defined medium lacking tryptophan and leucine, colonies were isolated and resuspended in water. Images of GFP fluorescence were captured with a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO two-photon laser scanning confocal microscope system. To evaluate the GFP reassembly statistically, the fluorescence intensity of GFP in 2 × 105 cells was measured by flow cytometry with a FAScan (BD Biosciences) at 488/530 nm. The fluorescence intensity distribution chart was reported together with the mean fluorescence intensity. PDI tagged with intact GFP at the N terminus was transfected into strain TG109 by the plasmid shuffle procedure to create strain TG110. This strain was used as the positive control, whereas strain TG109 was used as the non-GFP control. Strain 115 expressing isolated N- and C-terminal halves of GFP was used as the negative control to show that the split GFP did not self-reassemble during this experiment.Determination of Disulfide Bond Linkages—40 μg of the quadruple E123C, S247C, N306C, and D441C yPDI mutant were proteolytically digested for 2.5 h with 2.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, MA) in 100 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C. Optionally, the resulting peptides were reduced by the addition of 10 mm DTT and incubation for 10 min at 56 °C. Samples were desalted using Zip-Tip microcolumns (Millipore) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Peptides were directly eluted onto a stainless steel target by the addition of saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric detection was achieved using an Ultraflex TOF/TOF I (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) at 25 kV IS1 voltage in the reflector mode.RESULTSStructure of Full-length Yeast PDI Crystallized at Room Temperature—Initially, full-length yeast PDI was crystallized at 22 °C. However, crystals obtained at this temperature only diffracted to 3.7-Å resolution. At this limited resolution, the structure could not be easily solved. By reducing the temperature to 4 °C, crystal quality was significantly improved and a 2.4-Å structure could be determined (12Tian G. Xiang S. Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Cell. 2006; 124: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Armed with the 4 °C structure, the 3.7-Å dataset of the 22 °C crystals was solved by molecular replacement. Although only the temperature is different between the two crystallization conditions, a distinctly different structure was obtained. The final model was refined with Refmac, initially by rigid body refinement, followed by TLS refinement and a few cycles of restrained refinement with tight restraints to an R-factor of 0.242 (Rfree = 0.347). Despite the limited resolution and the correspondingly high free R-factor of the model the large conformational difference between the two structures are defined unambiguously in the electron density maps (Fig. 1A).Full-length yeast PDI contains residues 23 to 522 of the PDI1 gene and an additional vector-derived tetrapeptide, Ala-Gly-His-Met, at the N terminus with the Met numbered 22. The first three residues at the N terminus and eight residues at the C terminus are invisible, presumably due to disorder. As shown in Fig. 1B, the spatial arrangement of the b, b′, and a′ domains is very similar between the two crystal structures of full-length yeast PDI. Although the structure of the a domain does not change significantly, the relative position of this domain to the remainder of the molecule is dramatically different. The a domain is no longer in contact with the b′ domain and the center of gravity of the a domain now almost falls in the same plane as that of the other three domains (Fig. 1B). Thus, the overall structure of yeast PDI is no longer in the twisted U conformation described earlier, but instead adopts the shape of a “boat” (Fig. 1C) with the b and b′ domains at the bottom and the a and a′ domains at the bow and stern. Compared with the 4 °C structure, this structure is more extended, with a length of ∼90 Å and a height of ∼50 Å. Most importantly, the active sites of the a and the a′ domains no longer face each other.Molecular Flexibility—Based on both the 4 °C structure and this 22 °C structure, an examination of the inter-domain contacts indicates that the interaction between the b and b′ domain is relatively tight in the 4 and 22 °C structures, with a buried surface area of 650∼700 Å2. In contrast, the a and a′ domains are only loosely connected to this b-b′ base with negligibly small contact areas of ∼200 Å2 in each case. Therefore, the a and a′ domains can be viewed as two flexible arms connected to the relatively rigid base formed by the b and b′ domains. A comparison of the 4 and 22 °C structures of yeast PDI clearly confirms this molecular flexibility, especially the inter-domain mobility. As discussed earlier, the a domain exhibits the most dramatic difference between the two structures resulting in a ∼22-Å dislocation of the center of gravity of the a domain due to a ∼123° rotation around the loop connecting the a and b domains (Fig. 2A). This loop is formed by residues 139-142, which link the last α-helix of the a domain and the first β-strand of the b domain. The dihedral angles of residue Ser139 undergo the largest change, from φ = -77° and ψ = -11° in the 4 °C structure to φ = -100° and ψ = +138° in the 22 °C structure. In addition to the pronounced conformational change of the a domain, the relative orientations of the b, b′, and a′ domains also undergo small changes (Fig. 2, B and C). Keeping the b domain fixed, the b′ domain undergoes a ∼16° rotation around Ala237, resulting in a shift of the center of gravity by ∼5 Å, whereas the a′ domain is rotated around Ile364 relative to the b′ domain by ∼18°, resulting in a ∼7-Å displacement of the center of gravity.FIGURE 2Domain flexibility in PDI. A, conformational change of the a domain relative to the b domain in the 4 °C (magenta) and 22 °C (cyan) structures of full-length PDI. Only the a and b domains are shown. The active site cysteines in the a domain are shown in CPK representation with the S-atoms in yellow. All angles of rotation were computed with the CCP4 program LSQKAB. B, comparison of the relative orientation between the b and b′ domains in the 4 °C (magenta) and 22 °C (cyan) structures based on a superposition of the b domains. C, comparison of the relative orientation between the b′ and a′ domains in the 4 °C and the 22 °C structures based on a superposition of the b′ domain and color-coded as in A. D, Western blot analysis following limited proteolysis of His6-PDI. The digestion of 1 mg/ml His6-PDI was carried out in buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm glutathione with either trypsin or chymotrypsin at the indicated concentration at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Western blot analysis of the digestion product was carried out with anti-His6 and anti-HDEL antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Asymmetric Molecular Flexibility between the Two Arms of Yeast PDI—It has previously been demonstrated that PDI exhibits different sensitivities to protease digestion under reducing and oxidizing conditions (32Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and that mammalian PDI yielded two major fragments after partial digestion with trypsin (Fig. 3, panel G, in Ref. 32Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The sizes of these two fragments prompted us to speculate that the smaller fragment represents the arm of PDI that is more flexible and therefore more sensitive to trypsin digestion. Accordingly, we carried out limited proteolysis on yeast PDI with both chymotrypsin and trypsin under similar conditions. To determine which arm the smaller fragment belongs, two different markers were utilized: the N-terminal His6 tag for the a domain and the C-terminal HDEL ER retention signal for the a′ domain. As shown in Fig. 2D, the smaller fragments around 10 kDa that due to their size correspond to a single domain always contain the His6 tag, but not the HDEL sequence. On the other hand, the larger fragment around 40 kDa, which probably represents PDI with one domain trimmed off was detected by the anti-HDEL antibody, but not the anti-His6 tag antibody. This observation strongly suggests that the a domain arm was cleaved off of PDI first. Examination of the potential trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion sites in the loops connecting the a and a′ domains to the b-b′ base indicate that both of them appear to have an equal chance of being cleaved. Therefore, the observed asymmetric protease sensitivity of the a and a′ domain linkers can be attributed to differences in the molecular flexibility of the associated domains. In other words, the a arm of PDI is more flexible than the a′ arm. This was surprising because"

Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) 2The abbreviations used are: HSV, herpes simplex virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RT, reverse transcriptase; ACVTP, acyclovir triphosphate; HAART, highly active antiretroviral therapy; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP. and HIV infection are two of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide, sharing the pathogenic attribute of lifelong infection. Although the seroprevalence of HSV-2 ranges from more than 20% in the United States to as high as 60% in sub-Saharan Africa, the likelihood of HSV-2 infection in HIV-infected individuals can reach as high as 80% (1Corey L. Wald A. Celum C.L. Quinn T.C. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2004; 35: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addressing these high coinfection rates, both epidemiologic and biological studies have suggested an interaction between the two viruses. In HIV-infected patients, HSV can present with more severe mucocutaneous lesions and more frequent and persistent outbreaks (2Schacker T. Hu H.L. Koelle D.M. Zeh J. Saltzman R. Boon R. Shaughnessy M. Barnum G. Corey L. Ann. Intern. Med. 1998; 128: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Krone M.R. Wald A. Tabet S.R. Paradise M. Corey L. Celum C.L. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 30: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HIV infection also increases the frequency of acquisition of HSV-2 (1Corey L. Wald A. Celum C.L. Quinn T.C. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2004; 35: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In turn, HSV has been shown to accelerate the natural course of HIV infection, with higher plasma and genital levels of HIV and more rapid progression to AIDS (4Schacker T. Zeh J. Hu H. Shaughnessy M. Corey L. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Most disconcerting, HSV infection has been shown to increase both the frequency of HIV acquisition and the rate of transmission, demonstrating that these epidemics fuel one another, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality (5Freeman E.E. Weiss H.A. Glynn J.R. Cross P.L. Whitworth J.A. Hayes R.J. AIDS. 2006; 20: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The association between these epidemics has been strengthened by evidence demonstrating a plausible biological connection between these viral infections. HSV-2 proteins are capable of activating the HIV long terminal repeat, resulting in HIV gene expression (6Mosca J.D. Bednarik D.P. Raj N.B. Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Hayward G.S.

Dis. 1992; 166: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Also, higher rates of HIV infection in HSV-2-positive patients have been explained by HSV-induced mucosal disruption and specific recruitment of CD4+ cells to these ulcers, providing a portal for HIV infection (9Koelle D.M. Posavad C.M. Barnum G.R. Johnson M.L. Frank J.M. Corey L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, the guanosine analogue acyclovir provides one of the most effective therapies for treatment of HSV-2 infection during acute outbreaks or for long term prophylaxis against recurrent outbreaks. Within herpes virus-infected cells, the HSV thymidine kinase can phosphorylate the prodrug acyclovir at rates above those of cellular nucleoside kinases (10Keller P.M. Fyfe J.A. Beauchamp L. Lubbers C.M. Furman P.A. Schaeffer H.J. Elion G.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). After monophosphorylation, cellular kinases rapidly convert the drug to acyclovir triphosphate (ACVTP), which is incorporated into viral DNA by the HSV DNA polymerase but is not a substrate for human DNA polymerases (11Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19039-19044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because monophosphorylation and ACVTP incorporation are sequential steps at which selectivity is achieved and amplified, acyclovir is an efficacious and well tolerated drug. Mechanistic studies with the HSV DNA polymerase indicate that ACVTP competes with dGTP and is a chain terminator that results in the formation of a dead-end complex between the enzyme and DNA (11Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19039-19044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reardon J.E. Spector T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7405-7411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence for the interaction between the viruses has stimulated interest in modulation of HIV disease through therapy directed toward HSV. The guiding hypothesis behind these studies has been that decreasing HSV activation or the frequency of HSV lesions could indirectly modulate HIV progression or acquisition in coinfected patients. Most recently, two approaches to investigate the benefits of acyclovir or its prodrug, valacyclovir, have been reported (13Zuckerman R.A. Lucchetti A. Whittington W.L. Sanchez J. Coombs R.W.

Lucchetti A. Whittington W.L. Sanchez J. Coombs R.W. Zuniga R. Magaret A.S. Wald A. Corey L. Celum C. J. Infect. Dis. 2007; 196: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Nagot N.

Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Since viral load is correlated with rate of disease progression (15Mellors J.W. Rinaldo Jr., C.R. Gupta P. White R.M. Todd J.A. Kingsley L.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar), valacyclovir therapy was suggested as a means to delay the initiation of HAART in coinfected patients. In principle, this approach has the benefit of avoiding cumulative toxicities associated with HAART. Acyclovir could also be beneficial for prophylaxis against acquisition of HIV in HSV-2-infected patients. However, in trials designed to examine this possibility, no significant protection against HIV acquisition was noted (13Zuckerman R.A. Lucchetti A. Whittington W.L. Sanchez J. Coombs R.W. Zuniga R.

Med. 2008; 359: 535Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here we present findings that strongly indicate that the effects of acyclovir on HIV viral load arise directly from the inhibition of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme. Our findings raise significant concerns about the potential of generating cross-resistance to known HIV therapies by treatment of coinfected patients with acyclovir prior to a HAART regimen. Infections and Phenotypic Analysis—Dose-response curves for the anti-HIV activity of acyclovir (Sigma) were generated from infection of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated primary CD4+ lymphoblasts with a recombinant CXCR4 tropic HIV pseudovirus as described previously (18McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 1718-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Pseudovirus was generated from cotransfection of HEK293T cells with a plasmid containing the HIV genome with part of the envelope gene replaced with GFP (pNL4-3-ΔE-eGFP) and a plasmid containing a CXCR4 tropic envelope gene. CD4+ T cells were isolated from PHA-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors with selection using Miltenyi biotech magnetic beads. Experiments were repeated in three or more replicates each, with cells derived separately from more than five different healthy blood donors. Cells were preincubated with acyclovir for 16–20 h prior to infection to allow for cellular uptake. The V75I, T69N, and M184V mutant plasmids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of pNL4-3-ΔE-eGFP. Viruses were standardized using p24 enzyme-linked immunoabsorbancy assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Real-time PCR—CXCR4 tropic HIV pseudoviruses were DNase (Roche Applied Science)-treated and used to infect CD4+ lymphoblasts in the absence or presence of 400 μm acyclovir. Total DNA was isolated from cells (Qiagen) at 8 and 24 h after infection. Early, intermediate, and late reverse transcript products were quantified by real-time PCR using separate primer/probe sets as described previously (18McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 20Zack J.A.

A standard curve of pNL4-3-ΔE-eGFP was used to determine the copies of transcripts per cell. In Vitro Selection—PHA-activated primary CD4+ lymphoblasts were infected with a replication-competent laboratory reference strain of HIV (Ba-L) in the absence or presence of acyclovir. Every 3–5 days, 4% of the culture supernatant was used to infect freshly isolated CD4+ lymphoblasts in the presence of three times the acyclovir concentration as the previous infection. After 11 passages, cultures were maintained at 400 μm acyclovir. Total DNA was isolated from cells (Qiagen) after every passage, and the proviral pol gene was amplified at multiple time points using limiting dilution digital PCR for sequencing of single viral genomes adapted from a previously described method (21Bailey J.R. Sedaghat A.R. Kieffer T. Brennan T. Lee P.K. Wind-Rotolo M. Haggerty C.M. Kamireddi A.R. Liu Y. Lee J. Persaud D. Gallant J.E. Cofrancesco Jr., J. Quinn T.C. Wilke C.O. Ray S.C. Siliciano J.D.

A. 1999; 96: 9236-9241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). A minimum of 25 isolated viral genomes were sequenced under each condition at every evaluated time point. Reverse Transcriptase Assays—HIV RT produced in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography was kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Le Grice at the NCI, National Institutes of Health, Drug Resistance Program. For all assays, 5′-fluorescein-labeled DNA primer (Integrated DNA Technologies) and DNA templates (Invitrogen) were mixed at a 1:2 molar ratio in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and annealed by heating to 95 °C, stepwise cooling until 5 °C below the calculated Tm followed by cooling to reaction temperature of 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of RT and dNTPs or ACVTP (Moravek Biochemicals) and quenched by the addition of an equal volume of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA). Samples were denatured at 95 °C, and products were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea run at 50 °C. Labeled DNA was visualized by the capture of fluorescein emission on a Typhoon scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Product was quantified using the ImageJ software. Acyclovir Inhibits HIV Replication—To determine whether acyclovir can inhibit HIV replication in vitro, we used a sensitive single cell HIV infectivity assay that has previously been used to confirm the anti-HIV activity of known antiviral drugs (19Zhang H. Zhou Y. Alcock C. Kiefer T. Monie D. Siliciano J. Li Q. Pham P. Cofrancesco J. Persaud D. Siliciano R.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1718-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Shen L. Peterson S. Sedaghat A.R. McMahon M.A. Callender M. Zhang H. Zhou Y. Pitt E. Anderson K.S. Acosta E.P. Siliciano R.F. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and revealed the unanticipated anti-HIV activity of the hepatitis B drug entecavir (18McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The assay utilizes primary CD4+ lymphoblasts infected with a CXCR4 pseudotyped HIV virus capable of only a single round of infection due to replacement of part of the envelope gene with GFP. The infection was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of acyclovir, and productive infection was monitored by GFP expression (18McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H.

With the wild-type HIV reference strain, acyclovir inhibited HIV infection with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ∼5 μm (Fig. 1A). These results were reproduced with primary CD4+ T cells derived from more than five donors, indicating that these observations are generalizable. We hypothesized that the observed inhibition of HIV replication in vitro was due to direct anti-HIV activity. To narrow the range of potential molecular targets of acyclovir, we used a real-time PCR assay for detection of early, intermediate, and late reverse transcriptase products (18McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J.

Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). In this assay, drugs that inhibit at or before the reverse transcription step lead to a reduction in all transcription products. To perform this analysis, we infected CD4+ lymphoblasts in the absence or presence of acyclovir. When total DNA extracts were analyzed, the early, intermediate, and late reverse transcript products were all reduced (Fig. 1B), suggesting that inhibition by acyclovir takes place at or before reverse transcription. Acyclovir Selects for Mutations in HIV Reverse Transcriptase—To further validate the molecular target of acyclovir, we cultured primary CD4+ lymphoblasts with a replication-competent CCR5 tropic HIV isolate in the presence of increasing concentrations of acyclovir. At various times during the selection process, we sequenced single proviral genomes amplified using a limiting dilution PCR assay. As early as 5 days after the initial infection, at an acyclovir concentration of only 0.01 μm, we identified 1 out of 25 sequences (4%) containing the V75I RT multidrug resistance mutation (Fig. 1C). This mutation expanded rapidly between day 57 and 63 and came to dominate sequences after 94 days in culture, constituting 92% of the total viral population. Interestingly, two other known HIV drug resistance mutations, T69N and M184I (which typically precedes emergence of the M184V variant of RT), also appeared in the presence of acyclovir (Fig. 1C). In our unbiased resistance selection protocol, no other known HIV drug resistance mutations were observed, and the predominant mutations were localized to the RT gene. Virus in control cultures, carried out in parallel in the absence of acyclovir, remained wild type at these positions at all time points, with the exception of 1 of 52 sequences at day 63 and 1 of 35 sequences at day 94 that contained the T69N variant. These findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that HIV RT is the molecular target of acyclovir. Having identified RT mutations under acyclovir selective pressure, we sought to confirm their resistance phenotypes using our single cell HIV infectivity assay. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct isogenic strains differing only at each of the observed point mutant locations discovered through our selection protocol. The IC50 values for virus containing either the T69N or the M184V point mutations shifted ∼10-fold relative to wild-type virus (Fig. 1A). The V75I mutant virus, the dominant mutation noted in our selection protocol, had an IC50 shifted to >300 μm, approaching a nearly 2-log increase in resistance to acyclovir. Acyclovir Triphosphate Is a Substrate of RT and Competes with dGTP—Since acyclovir inhibited HIV infection at the single cell level and resistance was associated with mutations in RT, we next explored the mechanism by which acyclovir inhibited RT. Because acyclovir lacks a 3′-OH to allow for DNA extension, it might be expected to act as an obligate chain terminator of HIV RT. We assayed for the ability of purified HIV RT to incorporate ACVTP using an oligonucleotide DNA template-primer. As suggested by the mutagenesis findings, ACVTP could indeed be incorporated by RT (Fig. 2A). Although each tested template could be extended to full-length product in the presence of the cognate dNTP, ACVTP was only incorporated opposite to cytosine. As expected for a chain terminator, only a single ACVTP was incorporated. An important question is whether ACVTP is an effective competitor in the presence of physiological concentrations of dGTP. We sought to mimic potential physiological conditions in a competition-based assay that depended on multiple dGTP incorporations, as would be required of RT in copying the HIV genome. Templates were constructed containing poly-C overhangs beyond the primer terminus. Competition was evaluated at varying concentrations of ACVTP and using a fixed concentration of 5 μm dGTP, similar to the physiological concentration found in activated T cells (24Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). It was observed that shorter templates provided limited opportunity for competitive chain termination, whereas full-length product formation was significantly diminished for the longer templates (Fig. 2B). Thus, ACVTP is an increasingly effective inhibitor for formation of full-length chains as the number of potential incorporation events increases. Since the HIV genome is ∼10 kb in size, ∼2500 opportunities exist for a chain terminator such as ACVTP to incorporate in lieu of dGTP. This report demonstrates that the antiviral drug acyclovir inhibits HIV replication in primary CD4+ lymphoblasts and suggests that acyclovir is directly responsible for the decline in HIV plasma levels in HSV/HIV-coinfected patients on acyclovir monotherapy. Acyclic nucleoside or nucleotide analogs are used for the treatment of a variety of DNA and RNA viruses including the Herpes family of viruses (cidofovir and adefovir), hepatitis B virus (adefovir and tenofovir), and HIV (tenofovir). Based on these precedents, we evaluated the anti-HIV activity of acyclovir using an infectivity assay that has previously been used to evaluate currently approved anti-HIV drugs (19Zhang H. Zhou Y. Alcock C. Kiefer T. Monie D. Siliciano J. Li Q. Pham P. Cofrancesco J. Persaud D. Siliciano R.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1718-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Shen L. Peterson S.

Our assay relies on a single round of infection, thereby avoiding complications of virus outgrowth in multiround infection assays (25Ferguson N.M. Fraser C. Anderson R.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 97-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, we can precisely measure infection events in individual cells by flow cytometry. Further, rather than using tissue samples or a cultured cell line, the assay uses primary CD4+ T cells, the in vivo target cells of HIV. The cells were isolated from multiple donors, demonstrating the reproducible and general nature of the inhibition by acyclovir. Our conclusion that acyclovir is a direct inhibitor of HIV infection is supported by a recent report that used an alternate approach to demonstrate the anti-HIV activity of acyclovir in a tissue based assay (26Lisco A. Vanpouille C. Tchesnokov E.P. Grivel J.C. Biancotto A. Brichacek B. Elliott J. Fromentin E. Shattock R. Anton P. Gorelick R. Balzarini J. McGuigan C. Derudas M. Götte M. Schinazi R.F. Margolis L. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 260-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our results in a primary cell system are therefore almost certainly relevant to clinical treatments of HIV and HSV infections. Our finding that acyclovir selects for resistance mutations in HIV-RT provides strong evidence that RT is the in vivo target of this agent and also raises concerns for the selection of cross-resistance to approved RT inhibitors. Our assay identified and confirmed the resistance of the V75I variant, a known HIV drug resistance mutation, and one of several mutations that constitute the Q151M multidrug resistance pathway that imparts resistance to most currently approved anti-HIV nucleoside analogs (27Shirasaka T. Kavlick M.F. Ueno T. Gao W.Y. Kojima E. Alcaide M.L. Chokekijchai S. Roy B.M. Arnold E. Yarchoan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2398-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of the Q151M complex, isolated Val-75 mutations have been shown to have reduced susceptibility to several nucleoside analogs (28Matamoros T. Kim B. Menendez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1234-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to V75I, our selection protocol also identified the M184I (the M184V precursor) and T69N variants, both with ∼10-fold increased resistance to acyclovir. Although they appeared less fit than V75I in our single round infectivity assay, these mutations are of clinical significance. M184V confers near complete resistance to 3TC (lamivudine) or FTC (emtricitabine), drugs that form the foundation of most HAART regimens (29Schinazi R.F. Lloyd Jr., R.M. Nguyen M.H. Cannon D.L.

Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1390-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The T69N mutation broadly reduces sensitivity to currently approved nucleoside analogs either by itself or, more significantly, in the context of other thymidine analog mutations (32Winters M.A. Merigan T.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2276-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Johnson V.A. Brun-Vezinet F. Clotet B. Gunthard H.F. Kuritzkes D.R. Pillay D. Schapiro J.M. Richman D.D. Top. HIV Med. 2008; 16: 62-68PubMed Google Scholar). Although the full mechanism of RT inhibition by acyclovir remains to be explored, the dominant V75I mutation offers opportunity for speculation. Acyclovir inhibition of HSV DNA polymerase is due to the formation of a dead-end ternary complex involving the polymerase, the DNA substrate with acyclovir incorporated, and an incoming dNTP that is complementary to the template +1 position (11Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19039-19044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reardon J.E. Spector T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7405-7411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V75I is known to interact with the template +1 position (34Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). This correlation suggests the possibility that dead-end ternary complex formation may be compromised in the V75I RT variant. A more detailed study of this inhibition mechanism will likely provide a deeper understanding of the resistance mutations. The generally accepted mechanism for activation of acyclovir requires action of the HSV thymidine kinase and thus raises the question of whether acyclovir works only in cells that are coinfected with herpes viruses. Supporting this notion, the report by Lisco et al. (26Lisco A. Vanpouille C. Tchesnokov E.P. Grivel J.C. Biancotto A. Brichacek B. Elliott J. Fromentin E. Shattock R. Anton P. Gorelick R. Balzarini J. McGuigan C. Derudas M. Götte M. Schinazi R.F. Margolis L. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 260-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggested that the anti-HIV activity of acyclovir was dependent on herpes virus infection of the target tissues, and in particular, coinfection with the ubiquitous virus HHV-6. Our study used primary CD4+ T cells derived from normal donors, for which the herpes virus status is not known. It is notable, however, that low measurable levels of ACVTP are known to be generated even in non-HSV-infected cells (35Elion G.B. Furman P.A. Fyfe J.A. de Miranda P. Beauchamp L. Schaeffer H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5716-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Although coinfection may increase the levels of ACVTP and result in efficient RT inhibition in such cells, it is feasible that low levels of ACVTP generated by host enzymes in non-HSV-infected cells could effectively compete with dGTP given that a chain terminator of HIV replication has numerous opportunities for incorporation during HIV replication. Acyclovir is not as potent of an inhibitor of HIV infection as many nucleoside analogs. By comparison in our phenotypic assay, it is 50 times less potent than AZT (zidovudine) (IC50 ∼100 nm) and 500 times less potent than 3TC (lamivudine) (IC50 ∼10 nm) (18McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. Wind-Rotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J.

Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the maximal clinically achieved plasma concentration (Cmax) of acyclovir can be greater than 20 μm (36Jacobson M.A. J. Med. Virol. Suppl. 1993; 1: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the weak inhibition we see in vitro would not likely make acyclovir an effective suppressive HIV drug, the IC50 of 5 μm is well within concentrations achieved clinically and may be responsible for the observed ∼0.5 log10 decline in plasma HIV RNA levels seen in coinfected patients on suppressive acyclovir therapy (13Zuckerman R.A. Lucchetti A. Whittington W.L. Sanchez J. Coombs R.W. Zuniga R. Magaret A.S. Wald A. Corey L. Celum C. J. Infect. Dis. 2007; 196: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Nagot N.

Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In this light, acyclovir could prove to be a useful scaffold for future drug development. At the same time, the use of acyclovir at subinhibitory concentrations against HIV, as well as the often episodic nature of treatment for HSV exacerbations, create prime conditions for development of resistance mutations. Since we have established that the RT variants selected by acyclovir in vitro are also known HIV drug resistance mutations, it will be important to obtain baseline genotypes for coinfected patients that have been maintained on suppressive acyclovir or patients who acquire HIV while taking acyclovir. Episodic antiviral use also raises the concern that a wild-type clinical genotype may not reflect drug resistant variants that could be archived in the latent reservoir generated during prior acyclovir therapy (37Ruff C.T. Ray S.C. Kwon P. Zinn R. Pendleton A. Hutton N. Ashworth R. Gange S. Quinn T.C. Siliciano R.F. Persaud D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9481-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest the need for caution in the use of acyclovir in HSV/HIV-coinfected patients not on a suppressive HAART regimen and should prompt reinterpretation of the observed effects of antiviral compounds on the interplay of these two epidemic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2163470200,"Elevated levels of circulating fibrinogen are associated with an increased risk of atherothrombotic diseases although a causative correlation between high levels of fibrinogen and cardiovascular complications has not been established. We hypothesized that a potential mechanism for an increased prothrombotic state is the post-translational modification of fibrinogen by tyrosine nitration. Mass spectrometry identified tyrosine residues 292 and 422 at the carboxyl terminus of the β-chain as the principal sites of fibrinogen nitration <i>in vivo</i>. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the incorporation of nitrated fibrinogen molecules in fibrin fibers. The nitration of fibrinogen <i>in vivo</i> resulted in four distinct functional consequences: increased initial velocity of fibrin clot formation, altered fibrin clot architecture, increased fibrin clot stiffness, and reduced rate of clot lysis. The rate of fibrin clot formation and clot architecture was restored upon depletion of the tyrosine-nitrated fibrinogen molecules. An enhanced response to the knob ""B"" mimetic peptides Gly-His-Arg-Pro<sup>am</sup> and Ala-His-Arg-Pro<sup>am</sup> suggests that incorporation of nitrated fibrinogen molecules accelerates fibrin lateral aggregation. The data provide a novel biochemical risk factor that could explain epidemiological associations of oxidative stress and inflammation with thrombotic complications."
https://openalex.org/W1967211806,"COP1 is a Ring-Finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in plant development, mammalian cell survival, growth, and metabolism. Here we report that COP1, whose expression is enhanced by insulin, regulates FoxO1 protein stability. We found that in Fao hepatoma cells, ectopic expression of COP1 decreased, whereas knockdown of COP1 expression increased the level of endogenous FoxO1 protein without impacting other factors such as C/EBPα and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein). We further showed that COP1 binds FoxO1, enhances its ubiquitination, and promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To determine the biological significance of COP1-mediated FoxO1 protein degradation, we have examined the impact of COP1 on FoxO1-mediated gene expression and found that COP1 suppressed FoxO1 reporter gene as well as FoxO1 target genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two key targets for FoxO1 in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, with corresponding changes of hepatic glucose production in Fao cells. We suggest that by functioning as a FoxO1 E3 ligase, COP1 may play a role in the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. COP1 is a Ring-Finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in plant development, mammalian cell survival, growth, and metabolism. Here we report that COP1, whose expression is enhanced by insulin, regulates FoxO1 protein stability. We found that in Fao hepatoma cells, ectopic expression of COP1 decreased, whereas knockdown of COP1 expression increased the level of endogenous FoxO1 protein without impacting other factors such as C/EBPα and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein). We further showed that COP1 binds FoxO1, enhances its ubiquitination, and promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To determine the biological significance of COP1-mediated FoxO1 protein degradation, we have examined the impact of COP1 on FoxO1-mediated gene expression and found that COP1 suppressed FoxO1 reporter gene as well as FoxO1 target genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two key targets for FoxO1 in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, with corresponding changes of hepatic glucose production in Fao cells. We suggest that by functioning as a FoxO1 E3 ligase, COP1 may play a role in the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. COP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by the presence of three signature domains; that is, a RING-finger motif followed by a coiled-coil domain and seven WD40 repeats (1Yi C. Deng X.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). COP1 is evolutionarily conserved through higher eukaryotes so that mammalian COP1 was first cloned based on its sequence homology to Arabidopsis thaliana COP1 (2Wang H. Kang D. Deng X.W. Wei N. Curr.

Because all of these factors are involved in photomorphogenesis, COP1 is considered a central switch in light signal transduction during plant development. In mammals, COP1 has been shown to regulate the stabilities of p53, c-Jun, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), 4The abbreviations used are:ACC1acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1COP1constitutive photomorphogenic 1FoxO1Forkhead Box O1PEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinaseG6Paseglucose-6-phosphataseACC1acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1WDmotiftryptophan-aspartic acid motifRTreverse transcriptaseALLNN-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinalLAPliver-activating proteinLIPliver-inhibitory proteinCREBcAMP-response element (CRE)-binding proteinHAhemagglutininshRNAshort hairpin RNADexdexamethasoneFskforskolinGSTgreen fluorescent proteinPGC1PPAR gamma coactivator 1 each through different mechanisms. COP1 directly interacts with and functions as an E3 ligase for the tumor suppressor p53 to induce its degradation and inhibit p53-mediated gene expression (6Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Consequently, COP1 promotes cell cycle progression and cell survival (6Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). COP1 also inhibits c-Jun transcriptional activity. However, COP1 does not function as a c-Jun E3 ligase. Instead, COP1 recruits c-Jun to an E3 complex containing DET1, DDB1, cullin4A, and Roc (7Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhang Z. Dornan D. Arnott D. Deshaies R.J. Dixit V.M.

By interacting with the transactivation domain of c-Jun, COP1 can also inhibit its activity without altering c-Jun protein expression (3Bianchi E. Denti S. Catena R. Rossetti G. Polo S. Gasparian S.

Deshaies R.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 2004; 303: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Currently, the biological significance of c-Jun regulation by COP1 is not clear. Because c-Jun is a stress responsive transcription factor, it has been speculated that COP1 may be involved in cellular stress responses (8Yi C. Li S. Chen X. Wiemer E.A. Wang J. Wei N. Deng X.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5835-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). COP1 also functions as ACC1 E3 ligase. However, in this instance COP1 does not directly interact with ACC1. Instead, COP1 is recruited to ACC1 (9Qi L. Heredia J.E. Altarejos J.Y. Screaton R. Goebel N. Niessen S. Macleod I.X. Liew C.W. Kulkarni R.N. Bain J. Newgard C. Nelson M. Evans R.M. Yates J.

ACC 1 is a biotin-containing enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA, an intermediate metabolite with a key role in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism (12Tong L.

More recently, COP1 was also found to interact with TORC2, a signal-dependent CREB co-activator. In this study it was found that COP1 regulates TORC2 protein stability and thereby regulates liver glucose metabolism (13Dentin R. Liu Y. Koo S.H. Hedrick S. Vargas T. Heredia J. Yates III, J.

FoxO proteins are a family of transcription factors within the larger Forkhead family of proteins, named for their characteristic “forkhead box” DNA binding domain. The mammalian FoxO subfamily consists of at least four members including FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4, and FoxO6 (16Greer E.L. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7410-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). FoxO proteins are direct targets for Akt kinase, which phosphorylates these factors at multiple sites (e.g. Thr-32, Ser-256, and Thr-319 in FoxO1) (17Barthel A. Schmoll D. Unterman T.G.

Phosphorylation by Akt provides multiple mechanisms to regulate FoxO1-mediated gene expression including nuclear exclusion, FoxO1 protein degradation (for a review, see Ref. 16Greer E.L. Brunet A.

Acting as downstream targets of Akt, FoxO proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including growth, survival, differentiation, and metabolism. Of the different FoxO proteins, FoxO1 is recognized as a critical regulator of liver glucose metabolism (17Barthel A. Schmoll D. Unterman T.G. Trends Endocrinol.

Because COP1 interacts with TRB3 and because TRB3 has been shown to regulate glucose metabolism (10Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M.

During these studies we uncovered that COP1 expression is induced by insulin and that COP1 specifically modulates FoxO1 protein stability. Our data show that by down-regulation of FoxO1 COP1 regulates FoxO1 target genes such as G6Pase and PEPCK gene expression and, thereby, hepatic glucose production. Reagents—Human insulin, dexamethasone, forskolin, and reagents for glucose production were from Sigma-Aldrich. The proteasome inhibitor ALLN was from EMD Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ).

The mutation was verified by automated sequencing. The Δ3WD-COP1 and Δ6WD-COP1 constructs were generated using XbaI and NdeI sites within the human COP1 cDNA to remove the corresponding sequence from the C terminus.

The shRNA sequence that corresponded to mouse COP1 cDNA (739–758) and is identical to human COP1 is in italics. As a control for COP1 shRNA, we used a scrambled shRNA from Addgene Co (plasmid number 1864). To generate COP1 adenoviral expression vectors, HA-tagged COP1 was cloned into pAdTrack (28He T.C.

(v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections of HEK293 and HepG2 cells were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfection and luciferase assays have been described (30Du K. Asahara H. Jhala U.S. Wagner B.L. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4320-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was measured using FB12 luminometer (Zylux Co., Oak Ridge, TN). For adenoviral transduction (10Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), CsCl-purified adenovirus were incubated with cells for 4–8 h. The amount of virus used was to achieve more than 80! infection of cells. To transduce Fao cells with pMIGR1 retroviruses, the retroviruses were incubated with the cell in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) overnight. The amount of virus used was to achieve more than 80! transduction judged by the GFP-expressing cells. Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were treated as described in the figure legends, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted with o-IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1! Nonidet P-40, 10! glycerol, and protease inhibitors). For immunoprecipitation assays, total cell lysates were incubated overnight with primary antibodies (e.g. anti-FLAG antibodies) followed by a 45-min incubation with protein A/G-agarose. Immunoprecipitates bound to agarose beads were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For Western blot analysis of cell lysates, equal amounts of protein (typically 20–30 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked in 5! dry milk, and the membranes were incubated with each primary antibody and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The protein bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). All controls were resolved and probed on parallel blots loaded with the same amount of proteins, and no blots were stripped for re-probing. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR reactions were carried out using a kit (Ambion, Austin TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for PCR were: PEPCK, forward 5′-TGGTCTGGACTTCTTGACAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACCGTCTTGCTTTCGATCCTGG-3′; G6Pase, forward, 5′-TGTCTTGGTGTCTGTGATCGCTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAGTGAGCCGCAAGGTAGATCC-3′; 36B4 (the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 for control (31Laborda J.

Real time PCR were carried out using Option 2 Cycler (MJ Research) with the reagents from Applied Biosystem. The PCR cycles were: 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C 45 s for 24 cycles. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as previously described (32Vander Kooi B.T. Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Oeser J.K. Powell D.R. O'Brien R.M. J.

Briefly, Fao cells expressing GFP, COP1, and COP1 shRNA were treated with or without 100 nm insulin for 4 h. Then the cells were cross-linked with 1! formaldehyde, and nuclei were isolated. Next, the nuclei were lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5! Nonidet P-40), sonicated, and immunoprecipitated with anti-FoxO1 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates of FoxO1 were analyzed with PCR. The primers designed to amplify the rat G6Pase promoter are 5′-CAGACTCTGCCCTGAGCCTCTGGCCTG-3′ and 5-CCCTGGATTCAGTCTGTAGGTCAACCTAGC-3, which amplify the region of rat G6Pase promoter from –307 to –64. The PCR cycles were 95 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 30 s (–1 °C/cycle × 4), 72 °C for 30s, and then 95 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 2! agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Glucose Output Assays—Fao rat hepatoma cells infected with proper amount adenovirus (>80! infection) were treated with a combination of 0.25 μm dexamethasone and 2.5 μm forskolin or a combination of 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 2.5 μm forskolin, and 100 nm insulin for 5 h at 37°C. Cells were incubated for an additional 3 h in glucose production buffer (glucose-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm sodium lactate and 2 mm sodium pyruvate without phenol red), at the end of which 0.5 ml of medium was used to measure the glucose concentration using a glucose assay kit (Sigma 510-A). Cells were collected and lysed, and the total protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) to normalize for cell count. COP1 Expression Is Regulated by Insulin and cAMP in Fao Hepatoma Cells—COP1 interacts with TRB3 (9Qi L. Heredia J.E. Altarejos J.Y. Screaton R. Goebel N. Niessen S. Macleod I.X. Liew C.W.

Science. 2006; 312: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and TRB3 has been shown to regulate glucose metabolism in the liver and muscle (10Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 11Koh H.J. Arnolds D.E. Fujii N. Tran T.T. Rogers M.J. Jessen N. Li Y. Liew C.W. Ho R.C. Hirshman M.F. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. Goodyear L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8217-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined COP1 expression in Fao hepatoma cells, chosen for their fidelity to liver cells and their well preserved hormone responses (33Kahn C.R. Bertolotti R. Ninio M. Weiss M.C. Nature. 1981; 290: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Fehlmann M. Crettaz M. Kahn C.R. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of 100 nm insulin on expression of both COP1 mRNA and protein using RT-PCR and Western blotting assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, the level of COP1 mRNA is low in Fao cells under basal conditions and was incrementally induced after insulin stimulation with the maximum induction observed at 8 h after insulin treatment. The difference in the level of COP1 mRNA was not due to the variation of samples, as comparable levels of 36B4 were observed in all lanes (bottom panel). This increase in COP1 message also translated into increased levels of COP1 protein (Fig. 1B). In the liver, insulin, which is secreted in the fed state, displays an inverse regulatory effect on target gene expression compared with glucagon (cAMP) and glucocorticoids, which mediate the effects of fasting on glucose regulation. With this in mind we examined the effect of cAMP and glucocorticoids on insulin-induced COP1 expression. To this end, Fao cells were treated with a mix of dexamethasone and forskolin (cAMP agonist) (Dex/Fsk) for 4 h in the presence and absence of insulin. As presented in Fig. 1C, 4 h of insulin treatment of Fao cells increased COP1 mRNA by 3-fold. Dex/Fsk mix alone had no impact on COP1 expression (compare lanes 1 and 3). However, it strongly suppressed insulin-induced COP1 expression (compare lanes 2 and 4). We also examined expression of PEPCK gene, a known target for the above hormones during nutritional manipulations of fasting and refeeding. In keeping with their roles in regulating PEPCK, insulin suppressed, whereas Dex/Fsk induced expression of PEPCK gene. Comparable levels of 36B4 control were observed in each lane, suggesting an inverse hormonal regulation of COP1 and PEPCK mRNA. Taken together our data demonstrate that expression of COP1 is modulated by the same hormonal conditions that regulate hepatic glucose metabolism. COP1 Inhibits FoxO1 Protein Expression—After showing that insulin induces COP1 expression, we sought to determine whether COP1 might regulate the factors that are important for insulin-mediated cellular events, in particular, glucose metabolism. To this end, we decided to knock down or ectopically overexpress COP1 in Fao cells. To suppress COP1 expression, we generated a COP1 shRNA expression vector. Shown in Fig. 2A are Western blots of lysates from HEK293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged COP1 and FLAG-tagged TRB1 in the presence of increasing amounts of COP1 shRNA expression vector. COP1 shRNA suppressed expression of transfected FLAG-tagged COP1 in a dose-dependent manner (top panel, compare lanes 1, 2, and 3) and had no effect on FLAG-tagged TRB1 (bottom panel, used here as a control), indicating the specificity of this shRNA to COP1. We also examined the efficacy of this shRNA to suppress endogenous COP1 expression in Fao cells. Presented in Fig. 2B, when introduced into Fao cells via adenoviral transfer, this shRNA abrogated endogenous COP1 gene expression (compare lanes 1 and 3 or 2 and 4). Next, we assessed the impact of COP1 overexpression or knockdown on several hepatic factors that are important for insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis. Specifically, Fao cells were transduced with either GFP, COP1, or COP1 shRNA-expressing adenoviruses. Twenty-four hours post-transduction cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with insulin (100 nm) or 4 h. First, we evaluated COP1 protein expression by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2C, HA-COP1 adenovirus resulted in a strong expression of COP1 over endogenous protein (panel i, compare lanes 1 and 3) in Fao cells, whereas COP1 shRNA-expressing adenovirus effectively suppressed endogenous COP1 (compare lanes 1 and 5). Consistent with our earlier finding, insulin promoted COP1 protein expression (compare lanes 1 and 2). Next, we examined the effect of COP1 knockdown and overexpression on insulin action in hepatoma cells. In keeping with previous reports of insulin-dependent FoxO1 protein degradation (35Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Tanaka K. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11285-11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), insulin treatment decreased the level of FoxO1 protein by more than 70! (Fig. 2C, panel ii, compare lanes 1 and 2, and E). Ectopic expression of COP1 alone decreased the level of FoxO1 by more than 50! and by more than 90! with further insulin treatment (Fig. 2C, panel ii, compare lanes 1, 3, and 4, and E). Conversely, knockdown of COP1 increased the level of FoxO1 protein by about 3-fold (Fig. 2C, panel ii, compare lanes 1 and 5, and E). Insulin treatment still decreased the level of FoxO1 (Fig. 2C, panel ii, compare lanes 5 and 6, but the level of FoxO1 remained comparable with control conditions (compare lanes 1 and 6), Taken together, our data show that COP1 is likely a regulator of FoxO1. We also examined the expression of C/EBPα and CEBPβ. No changes were observed in the expression of C/EBPα (panel vi). However, insulin induced C/EBPβ expression by more than 3-fold (panel iii, compare lanes 1 and 2, and E). COP1, whose expression increased in conjunction with insulin stimulation, also induced C/EBPβ expression (about 2.5-fold, panel iv, compare lanes 1 and 3, and F). Correspondingly, knockdown of COP1 reduced C/EBPβ expression induced by insulin (Fig. 2C, panel iv, lanes 5 and 6, and F). Expression of other proteins with critical roles in hepatic gene expression including Fox2A, PGC1α, and CREB showed no change under any of the experimental conditions used here (supplemental Fig. 1) COP1 has been shown to down-regulate p53 protein in response to DNA damage (6Dornan D.

Thus, we examined the level of p53 in response to COP1 overexpression or knockdown in Fao cells. In contrast to its effects on FoxO1 and C/EBPβ, no change of p53 protein was detected regardless of COP1 expression (su"

Here, we measured the relative toxicity of ziram (a UPS inhibitor) and analogs to dopaminergic neurons and examined the mechanism of cell death. UPS (26 S) activity was measured in cell lines after exposure to ziram and related compounds. Dimethyl- and diethyldithiocarbamates including ziram were potent UPS inhibitors. Primary ventral mesencephalic cultures were exposed to ziram, and cell toxicity was assessed by staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and NeuN antigen. Ziram caused a preferential damage to TH+ neurons and elevated α-synuclein levels but did not increase aggregate formation. Mechanistically, ziram altered UPS function through interfering with the targeting of substrates by inhibiting ubiquitin E1 ligase. Sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate administered to mice for 2 weeks resulted in persistent motor deficits and a mild reduction in striatal TH staining but no nigral cell loss. These results demonstrate that ziram causes selective dopaminergic cell damage in vitro by inhibiting an important degradative pathway implicated in the etiology of PD. Chronic exposure to widely used dithiocarbamate fungicides may contribute to the development of PD, and elucidation of its mechanism would identify a new potential therapeutic target.

The etiology probably involves both environmental and genetic factors including pesticide exposure (1.Ascherio A. Chen H. Weisskopf M.G. O'Reilly E. McCullough M.L. Calle E.E.

Because no individual pesticide has been established by epidemiologic studies, we chose to perform an unbiased screen of potential toxicants for their ability to interfere with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a biological pathway implicated in the etiology of PD. Impaired UPS activity has been reported in the brains of patients with PD, and mutations in two UPS genes, Parkin and UCHL-1, cause rare genetic forms of PD (4.McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Although these results are not universally reproduced (5.Manning-Bog A.B. Reaney S.H. Chou V.P. Johnston L.C. McCormack A.L.

We hypothesized that chronic pesticide exposure may increase the risk of developing PD by inhibiting the UPS. We screened several pesticides for their ability to inhibit the UPS and found a number of toxicants that can lower activity at relevant concentrations (11.Wang X.F. Li S. Chou A.P. Bronstein J.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We then focused on dithiocarbamate fungicides because they were found to be one of the most potent UPS inhibitors and are widely used in crop protection.In the present study, zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate (ziram) was one of several dimethyl- and diethyldithiocarbamates found to inhibit the UPS at 0.15–1 μm. Furthermore, ziram increased α-synuclein expression in DA cells, induced relatively selective DA cell damage in vitro, and inhibited the UPS by interfering with ubiquitin E1 ligase activity. In vivo, systemic administration of the more soluble sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate (NaDMDC) in mice resulted in motor deficits and damage to the nigrostriatal pathway. These findings help explain how chronic pesticide exposure could increase the risk of developing PD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—The test compounds (see Table 1) were from Chem Service (West Chester, PA), Sigma-Aldrich, or other commercial sources as the highest available purity, except for 7 and 8, which were synthesized by Karl Fisher in the Casida laboratory.TABLE 1Structure-activity relationships for ziram-related compounds on 26 S UPS with 24-h treatment of SK-N-MC cells Open table in a new tab Measurement of 26 S Proteasome Activity and Cell Death in Cell Lines—26 and 20 S UPS activity and cell death were measured in human embryonic kidney (HEK) and neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells by flow cytometry as previously described (12.Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of the green fluorescent protein degron fusion protein (GFP-U) was measured and expressed as a percentage of control.Rat Primary Ventral Mesencephalic Cultures (VMC)—VMC were prepared by using a protocol adapted from Rayport et al. (13.Rayport S. Sulzer D. Shi W.X. Sawasdikosol S. Monaco J. Batson D. Rajendran G. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4264-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were prepared in two stages. In the first stage, cortical glial feeder cells were established on polyornithine/laminin-coated coverslips, which formed the base of a 10-mm-diameter well cut into 35-mm culture dishes, until they reached confluency in ∼6 days. Fluorodeoxyuridine was then added to prevent additional glial proliferation. In the second stage, postnatal day 2 or 3 pups were anesthetized, and 1 mm3 mesencephalic blocks containing the ventral tegmental area were dissected from sagittal sections taken along the midline of the brain. The cells were dissociated and plated onto pre-established glial feeder cells at densities of 1 × 105/coverslip. The mixed cultures were grown in chemically defined media containing fluorodeoxyuridine for 10 days before treatment and analysis.Immunocytochemistry in VMCs and Cell Counts—At the conclusion of the experiment, the cultures were immediately washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cultures were then incubated with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibodies (1:500; Calbiochem) and anti-NeuN antibodies (1:100; Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C. The cells were stained for 2 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). In some experiments, the cells were stained with anti-TH and anti-α-synuclein (1:500; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies. After staining and prior to counting, the coverslips were randomly assigned an identification number. TH- and NeuN-immunoreactive neuron counts were then determined manually by raters blinded to the experimental conditions. For TH, the entire coverslip was counted but for NeuN+ neurons, representative fields from each coverslip were counted and averaged because of their large number.Determination of Dopamine Content in VMCs—VMCs were homogenized in 0.1 m perchloric acid containing 0.1% EDTA. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered through a Millipore MC cartridge. The filtrate was analyzed for dopamine by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (Antec Leyden, Leiden, The Netherlands) using a mobile phase consisting of sodium acetate (75 mm), sodium dodecane sulfonate (0.75 mm), EDTA (10 mm), triethylamine (0.01%), acetonitrile (12%), methanol (12%), and tetrahydrofuran (1%), pH 5.5, pumped at a rate of 200 μl/min (model LC-10AD; Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) through a 100 × 2 mm column (3 μm, Hypersil C18; Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA). The data were collected and analyzed using ChromPerfect software (Justice Innovations, Mountain View, CA).Quantitation of α-Synuclein Expression—TH-positive cells in each coverslip were identified under 10×, and digital images were obtained using a 40× objective for TH and α-synuclein immunoreactivity. Exposure times were held constant between coverslips. After acquisition, the images were randomly assigned an identification number, and the experimental conditions were blinded. All of the images were stacked into a single sequence, a polygonal region of interest was manually drawn around the neuron, and the mean image intensity, total image intensity, and the area inside the region of interest were evaluated for each cell. Data analysis was performed with IPLab ver 3.x for Windows (Scanalytics Inc.) compensating for bleed-through between fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3 channels.To determine whether ziram treatment leads to high molecular weight α-synuclein species, we performed Western blots on the detergent-soluble fractions of culture lysates. VMCs treated with either 1 μm ziram or 5 μm lactocystin were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. The lysates were sonicated, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. The protein concentrations were determined, and 10 μg/lane were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with an anti-α-synuclein antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories; 1:1000) followed by an anti-tubulin antibody for normalization.Evaluation of E1 Ligase Activity—The effects of ziram on E1 ligase activity were investigated using Western blot analysis of treated cellular extracts to determine E1/E1-ubiquitin ratios and using purified enzyme preparations. Ziram-treated SK-N-MC cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in a thiol stabilizing buffer using the method of Jha et al. (14.Jha N. Kumar M.J. Boonplueang R. Andersen J.K. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The samples were sonicated for 10 s, centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g, mixed with 2 parts thiol gel buffer (33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.7 m urea, 2.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 13% glycerol), and boiled for 2 min, and 10 μg of protein/lane was loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). The proteins were electrophoretically transblotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and immunoblots were performed as previously described (16.Chow E. Mottahedeh J. Prins M. Ridder W. Nusinowitz S. Bronstein J.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using anti-E1 ligase antibody (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Antigen-antibody interactions for immunoblots were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemoluminesence substrate (Pierce).For purified enzyme assays, human recombinant ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme and biotinylated ubiquitin (both from BIOMOL) were incubated for 5 or 10 min in thiolester buffer as per the manufacturer's protocol. The reactions were stopped using thiol-stabilizing buffer, and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto nitrocellulose paper. E1-ubiquitin conjugates were determined using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Band densities were measured using a scanning densitometer.Animal Studies—Male C57BL/6 mice were treated for 2 weeks by subcutaneous osmotic minipumps with NaDMDC 50 mg/kg/day) in phosphate-buffered saline or with phosphate-buffered saline only. The behavior of the mice was evaluated using the pole test as described by Fleming et al. (17.Fleming S.M. Salcedo J. Fernagut P.O. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Levine M.S. Chesselet M.F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9434-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) except that a cut-off time of 60 s was used. One week after the last behavioral testing, the mice were perfused with fixative, and their brains were sectioned for TH staining. Fiber density was measured with a computer-assisted image analysis system as previously described (18.Bordelon Y.M. Chesselet M.F. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).For stereological analysis in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the neurons were counted using the optical fractionator method with the Stereo Investigator software (Microbrightfield, Colchester, VT) coupled to a Leica DM-LB microscope with a Ludl XYZ motorized stage and z axis microcator (MT12; Heidenheim, Traunreut, Germany). The SNc was delineated at 5× objective using previously reported criteria (19.McCormack A.L. Thiruchelvam M. Manning-Bog A.B. Thiffault C. Langston J.W. Cory-Slechta D.A. Di Monte D.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 20.West M.J. Slomianka L. Gundersen H.J. Anat. Rec. 1991; 231: 482-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). After delineation at low magnification, every fourth section throughout the SNc was counted at 100× magnification.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison post-test and Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test as appropriate. For histochemistry and behavior, statistical analysis was performed with GB-Stat software (Dynamic Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, 2000) for Macintosh. A 2 × 3 mixed design ANOVA was followed by post hoc analysis with Fisher's least significant difference. To maintain homogeneity of variance, an inverse transform was calculated (21.Cohen J. Cohen P. Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences. 2nd Ed. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ1983Google Scholar) for each score in the pole test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSZiram Inhibits 26 S Proteasome Activity in HEK Cells—We reported earlier that ziram inhibits 26 S UPS in SK-N-MC cells expressing a GFP-degron reporter system (11.Wang X.F. Li S. Chou A.P. Bronstein J.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine whether ziram causes a similar inhibition in a non-neuronal cell line, HEK cells were exposed, and GFP accumulation was measured using flow cytometry. We found that HEK cells were similarly sensitive to the 26 S inhibitory effects of ziram with an IC50 of 161 nm (Fig. 1).Structure-Activity Relationships of Ziram-related Compounds for UPS Inhibition—Ziram and 14 related compounds were tested at 1 and 10 μm for their ability to inhibit 26 S UPS activity in GFP-U-transfected SK-N-MC cells (Table 1). Ziram (1) and the other DMDC derivatives (sodium DMDC (2), free acid (3), and bis-disulfide (4)) were similarly very active. Two diethyldithiocarbamates (5 and 6) were also very potent. Thiram (4) and disulfiram (6) are cleaved into DMDC (3) and diethyldithiocarbamate (5), respectively. Ziram in aqueous solution dissociates to zinc ion (7) and forms dithio acid (3), which breaks down into carbon disulfide (8) and dimethylamine (9), all of which were inactive. The disulfide functionality of etem (10) (an ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide oxidation product) can cleave to a dithiocarbamic acid possibly associated with its activity, whereas that of the phenyl analog (11) cannot give a dithiocarbamate. The carbon disulfide progenitor enzone (12) was also inactive. Environmental degradation converts ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) fungicides to ethylenethiourea (13) and sodium methyldithiocarbamate (14) to methyl isothiocyanate (15), all of which were inactive. Thus, the dialkyldithiocarbamate moiety is required to alter UPS activity. Furthermore, preincubation of ziram with the reducing agents GSH, dithiothreitol, or N-acetylcysteine completely abolished its inhibitory activity (data not shown).Ziram Causes Dopaminergic Cell Damage in Primary VMC—Because proteasome inhibition has been implicated in the etiology of PD and ziram causes UPS dysfunction, dopaminergic cells might be selectively vulnerable to the toxicity of ziram. Primary VMC were exposed to ziram for 48 h, and then cellular toxicity was measured by counting TH immuno-positive (TH+) cells and NeuN immuno-positive (NeuN+) cells (a nonspecific neuronal marker). Ziram at 5 and 10 μm was highly toxic to all cells, including the glial bed, causing the cell layers to lift off the coverslip after treatment or during immunostaining (data not shown). At lower doses Ziram exposure had a significant overall effect on TH+ cell survival (F4,110 = 4.52, p < 0.005) reducing TH+ cell number at 0.5 and 1 μm (p < 0.05, Dunnet's post-hoc test versus control; Fig. 2). The small, nonsignificant decrease in total NeuN+ cells measured after ziram treatment therefore represents primarily the loss of the TH+ subset of the entire NeuN+ pool. The loss of TH+ cells is likely reflective of cell death and not simply the loss of expression because TH levels were increased in the surviving positive cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2Ziram- and lactacystin-induced tyrosine hydroxylase cell damage in primary mesencephalic cultures. TH+ neurons were selectively vulnerable to ziram-but not lactacystin-induced damage. Shown below are representative photomicrographs of TH-(red) and NeuN-stained (green) mesencephalic cultures.

In the present study lactacystin was toxic to NeuN+ neurons (F4,110 = 13.12, p < 0.0001) and to the TH+ subset of such neurons (F4,110 = 4.26, p < 0.003), but the TH+/NeuN+ ratios revealed that the effects of lactacystin were not specific to dopaminergic neurons (F4,110 = 0.90, p > 0.05; Fig. 2). Because ziram caused preferential loss of TH+ neurons and lactacystin did not, they appear to act via different mechanisms, despite the fact that they are both UPS inhibitors.Ziram Toxicity Is Not Dopamine-dependent—One possible mechanism for the relative selective effect to TH+ neurons is that ziram interacts with dopamine metabolism to produce preferential toxicity. To test this hypothesis, ziram toxicity was measured in the presence of α-methyl l-tyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis. Treatment of VMCs with α-methyl l-tyrosine (250 μm) for 48 h resulted in a decrease in dopamine content of 62 ± 6% compared with controls (p ≤ 0.05) but did not significantly alter the number of TH+ cells. Reducing dopamine content with α-methyl l-tyrosine was ineffective in attenuating the toxicity of ziram to TH+ neurons (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Inhibition of dopamine synthesis by α-methyl-l-tyrosine did not attenuate ziram-induced dopamine cell death (n = 14–44 wells per condition). *, p ≤ 0.05, ziram versus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. +, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)α-Synuclein Expression in VMCs—Several converging lines of evidence support a role for α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD. Mutations in the α-synuclein gene or increased expression of wild-type α-synuclein cause PD in familial PD, and α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies in sporadic PD (22.Singleton A.B. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 416-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether ziram alters the levels of α-synuclein in VMCs, the neurons were stained for both TH and α-synuclein, and relative fluorescence was measured. TH+ neurons showed robust and punctate α-synuclein staining, suggesting that they are mature and terminally differentiated (23.Quilty M.C. Gai W.P. Pountney D.L. West A.K. Vickers J.C. Exp.

Ziram at 0.5 μm resulted in increased α-synuclein expression, whereas lactacystin at 5 μm decreased expression (Fig. 4). The sizes of the regions of interest were the same among all of the conditions varied in all of the experiments (data not shown).FIGURE 4Ziram increases and lactacystin decreases α-synuclein levels in TH+ neurons.

TH+ cells from ziram- and lactacystin-treated VMCs were determined to be either positive or negative for nuclear, perinuclear, or cytoplasmic α-synuclein inclusions by blinded raters. Aggregates were relatively common in both treated and untreated cells, but surprisingly no significant differences were found with ziram compared with controls. Interestingly, a decrease in nuclear and perinuclear aggregates was seen in the lactacystin-treated cultures (Table 2).TABLE 2Ziram does not induce the formation of α-synuclein aggregatesCells with inclusionsNuclearPerinuclearCytoplasmic%Control32 ± 522 ± 44.3 ± 2.1Ziram 0.5 μm38 ± 624 ± 56.6 ± 2.9 1.0 μm19 ± 914 ± 84.8 ± 4.8Lactacystin (5 μm)19 ± 4ap = 0.04.8.6 ± 3.1bp = 0.01.7.4 ± 2.9a p = 0.04.b p = 0.01. Open table in a new tab To determine whether ziram treatment results in increased formation of detergent-soluble α-synuclein oligomer formation, we subjected VMCs lysates to Western blot analysis. Both monomeric and oligomeric forms of α-synuclein were apparent in detergent-soluble fractions as previously described (25.Rideout H.J. Dietrich P. Wang Q. Dauer W.T. Stefanis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46915-46920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ziram treatment resulted in a nonsignificant trend for an increase in oligomeric forms of α-synuclein compared with controls (170 ± 120% optical density units of controls, n = 8 for ziram and n = 5 for controls, p = 0.18). Oligomeric α-synuclein was unchanged in lactacystin-treated VMCs, and monomeric α-synuclein levels were similar in all three conditions (data not shown).Ziram Inhibits E1 Ligase Activity—Ziram was found to inhibit the UPS using an assay that requires the substrate (i.e. degron) to be ubiquitinylated via ubiquitin ligases and recognized by the 26 S proteasome before it can be degraded by 20 S proteases (12.Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Disruption of any of these steps would be detected in the screen. It has been suggested that another dithiocarbamate fungicide, maneb, inhibits the 20 S component of the UPS (26.Zhou Y. Shie F.S. Piccardo P. Montine T.J. Zhang J. Neuroscience. 2004; 128: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine whether ziram acted in this manner, HEK cells were treated with ziram (1 and 10 μm) for 24 h, but there was no change in 20 S chymotryptic activity (data not shown). The amount of α-subunit of the 20 S proteasome was also measured using Western blot analysis, and no differences were found (data not shown). Furthermore, our earlier study showed that ziram had no effect on 20 S UPS activity when added directly to cell lysate (11.Wang X.F. Li S. Chou A.P. Bronstein J.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 23: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because 20 S proteolytic activity was not altered by ziram, Western blot analysis on lysates was performed from ziram-treated cells to determine whether ubiquitinated proteins accumulated. As expected, inhibition of the 20 S UPS by lactacystin and rotenone resulted in the accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 5). Conversely, ziram treatment resulted in a significant decrease in these proteins, suggesting that it inhibits the UPS by interfering with ubiquitin ligation. Polyubiquitin is added to proteins targeted for UPS degradation by a series of ligases (E1, E2, and E3 ligases). Dithiocarbamates can lead to GSH oxidation (27.Burkitt M.J. Bishop H.S. Milne L. Tsang S.Y. Provan G.J. Nobel C.S. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and GSH depletion results in the loss of E1 ligase activity (14.Jha N. Kumar M.J. Boonplueang R. Andersen J.K. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ziram does not appear to act by lowering GSH, because depleting cellular GSH using buthionine sulfoximine (1 mm) had no effect on UPS activity, and ziram did not alter the amount of reduced GSH in the cells at concentrations up to 50 μm (data not shown). Ubiquitin is activated by E1 ligase in an ATP-dependent manner forming an E1-ubiquitin adduct before the ubiquitin is transferred to E2 ligase. Because activated ubiquitin binds covalently to a cysteine of E1, the thiol group of ziram might interfere with this reaction. Indeed, ziram markedly reduced E1 ligase activity as measured by a reduction of endogenous E1-ubiq"

Phycobilisome degradation leads to a color change of the cells from blue-green to yellow-green, referred to as bleaching or chlorosis. As reported previously, NblA binds via a conserved region at its C terminus to the α-subunits of phycobiliproteins, the main components of phycobilisomes. We demonstrate here that a highly conserved stretch of amino acids in the N-terminal helix of NblA is essential for protein function in vivo. Affinity purification of glutathione S-transferase-tagged NblA, expressed in a Nostoc sp.

ATP-dependent binding of NblA to ClpC was corroborated by in vitro pull-down assays. Introducing amino acid exchanges, we verified that the conserved N-terminal motif of NblA mediates the interaction with ClpC. Further results indicate that NblA binds phycobiliprotein subunits and ClpC simultaneously, thus bringing the proteins into close proximity. Altogether these results suggest that NblA may act as an adaptor protein that guides a ClpC·ClpP complex to the phycobiliprotein disks in the rods of phycobilisomes, thereby initiating the degradation process.

Nitrogen deficiency causes a dramatic color change of cyanobacterial cultures from blue-green to yellow-green, a phenomenon described as “nitrogen chlorosis” nearly 100 years ago (1Boresch K. Lotos (Prague). 1910; 58: 344-345Google Scholar). This bleaching is mainly due to the degradation of the cyanobacterial antenna pigment complexes called phycobilisomes (2Allen M.M. Smith A.J. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1969; 69: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 3Lau R.H. MacKenzie M.M. Doolittle W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 132: 771-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Each PBS is composed of a core, which is anchored to the thylakoid membrane, and peripheral rods building the typical hemidiscoidal structure (4Glazer A.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1982; 36: 173-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5MacColl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 6Adir N. Photosyn. Res. 2005; 85: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Phycobiliproteins can constitute up to half of the total soluble protein of a cyanobacterial cell (7Bogorad L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 369-401Crossref Google Scholar). Their degradation during nitrogen deprivation is part of a complex acclimation process that is thought to fulfill two functions: preventing photo damage under stress and providing substrates for synthesis of proteins required for the adaptation. PBS degradation proceeds in an ordered manner, beginning with the successive loss of the peripheral rods (trimming) and ending with the degradation of the core components (8Yamanaka Y. Glazer A.N. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 124: 39-47Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It is reversible at any time. As soon as a nitrogen source is available again, the PBS are resynthesized. The detailed mechanism of PBS degradation is not yet understood. However, screening for non-bleaching (nbl) mutants of Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (Synechococcus 7942) revealed several genes that are involved in the degradation process (10Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Schwarz R. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 2005; 58: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Among the proteins encoded by these “non-bleaching” genes, one (nblA encoding protein NblA) is directly involved in PBS degradation and appears to play the key role in this process (10Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Inactivation of orthologs of nblA led to non-bleaching phenotypes in several other cyanobacterial species (15Baier K. Nicklisch S. Grundner C. Reinecke J. Lockau W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 195: 35-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li H. Sherman L.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Baier K. Lehmann H. Stephan D.P. Lockau W. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the filamentous, diazotrophic cyanobacteria Nostoc sp. PCC7120 (Nostoc 7120) and Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 this non-bleaching phenotype is most obvious in heterocysts, cells specialized for fixing N2 under aerobic conditions, which usually contain only low levels of phycobiliproteins (18Wolk C.P. Bacteriol. Rev. 1973; 37: 32-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Meeks J.C. Elhai J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 94-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Upon nitrogen step-down, transcription of nblA is highly up-regulated (10Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 15Baier K. Nicklisch S.

Genes homologous to nblA are present in most phycobiliprotein-containing cyanobacteria and in red algae. Of the 26 nblA orthologs found in databases, 20 are from cyanobacterial strains, 5 from chloroplasts of red algae, and 1 from a cyanophage. However, nblA seems to be absent from Prochlorococcus strains, from marine Synechococcus subclusters MC-A and MC-B, 3M. Ostrowski, Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, personal communication. 3M. Ostrowski, Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, personal communication. and from Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421 (24Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Sato S. Mimuro M. Miyashita H. Tsuchiya T. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Kawashima K. Kishida Y. Kiyokawa C. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Yamada M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The NblA proteins are rather small, consisting of around 60 amino acid residues corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼7 kDa. Although the homology between different NblA sequences is not very high (about 30% sequence identity on average), they seem to share similar structures. The crystal structure of NblA from Nostoc 7120 demonstrates that the NblA polypeptide consists of two α-helices, a shorter N-terminal and a longer C-terminal one. Two NblA molecules form a homodimer in which the C-terminal helices are involved in dimerization (25Bienert R. Baier K. Volkmer R. Lockau W. Heinemann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5216-5223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Crystallographic data of NblA from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus suggest a similar structure for this protein (26Dines M. Sendersky E. Schwarz R. Adir N. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Sequence and structure of NblA show no significant similarity to proteins with known function, and the molecular mechanism of NblA action in PBS degradation is not clear. In vitro studies showed that NblA interacts with the α-subunits of phycobiliproteins (22Luque I. Ochoa de Alda J.A. Richaud C. Zabulon G. Thomas J.-C. Houmard J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Bienert R. Baier K. Volkmer R. Lockau W. Heinemann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5216-5223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, results of binding experiments with variants of NblA carrying amino acid substitutions at various positions provided evidence that the interaction with phycobiliproteins is mediated via conserved amino acid residues near its C terminus (25Bienert R. Baier K. Volkmer R. Lockau W. Heinemann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5216-5223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the most highly conserved stretch of amino acids of the protein is located near its N terminus. In this study we show that NblA interacts with a chaperone, the HSP100/Clp protein ClpC, via a highly conserved motif located at the beginning of its N-terminal helix. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Strains are listed in supplemental Table S1. Nostoc 7120 and its mutants were grown at 28 °C under constant illumination (cool-white fluorescent lamps, average light intensity 50 μmol of photon m–2 s–1) in BG11 medium that contains 17.6 mm sodium nitrate as nitrogen source, or in BG110, which lacks sodium nitrate (27Rippka R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were bubbled with 2% (v/v) CO2 in air. For growth on plates, the medium was solidified with separately autoclaved 0.6% (w/v) agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Mutants were grown in the presence of 150 μg ml–1 neomycin, 4 μg ml–1 spectinomycin, and 1 μg ml–1 streptomycin, respectively. For nitrogen starvation experiments, cyanobacterial cultures exponentially growing in BG11 medium were collected by filtration through a nylon net filter (11 μm pore size, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), washed twice with BG110, resuspended in this medium to a concentration of about 5 μg of chlorophyll ml–1 and grown further. Chlorophyll content was estimated in methanolic extracts according to Tandeau de Marsac and Houmard (28Tandeau de Marsac N. Houmard J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 318-328Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Whole cell absorbance spectra were recorded in the wavelength range from 550 to 750 nm on a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere and were corrected for residual cell scattering at 750 nm. Strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) were grown under standard conditions. When appropriate, antibiotics were added to the medium to final concentrations of 50 μg ml–1 ampicillin, 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin sulfate, 25 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol, or 50 μg ml–1 spectinomycin, respectively. Plasmid and Mutant Constructions—Plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table S1. For reversion of the Nostoc 7120 ΔnblA mutant to the wild-type phenotype, a 1239-bp fragment, bearing the chromosomal nblA gene asr4517 (kazusa.or.jp/cyano/Nostoc/index.html) (29Kaneko T. Nakamura Y.

Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) together with upstream and downstream sequences, was amplified by PCR using primers 2.11 (XbaI site inserted) and 2.12 (XhoI site inserted), and 2.16 (XhoI site inserted) and 2.17 (EcoRV and BglII site inserted), respectively. The fragments were ligated into the pIC20R vector (73Marsh J.L. Erfle M. Wykes E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) to yield plasmid pIC20RnblA-T. For details of construction see supplemental Fig. S1A. Using plasmid pIC20RnblA-T as template, primers were designed to produce site-specific mutations, and mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragments harboring the nblA gene or its mutated variants, flanked by the promoter and terminator regions, were then excised by EcoRI digestion and ligated into the self-replicating plasmid pRL1049 (74Black T.A. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Transfer of plasmids between the ΔnblA mutant of Nostoc 7120 and E. coli was achieved by conjugation using E. coli strain J53 bearing RP4 and cargo strain HB101, bearing helper plasmid pRL528, in triparental matings (30Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Exconjugants were selected on BG11 agar plates containing 150 μg ml–1 neomycin, 4 μg ml–1 spectinomycin, and 1 μg ml–1 streptomycin. Expression of NblA-GST Fusion Protein in Nostoc 7120—For expression of NblA C-terminal fused to GST in ΔnblA mutant cells the nblA gene together with upstream sequences was amplified by PCR using primers 2.11 (XbaI site inserted) and 2.12 (XhoI site inserted) and ligated into the pIC20R vector yielding plasmid pIC20RnblA. This pIC20RnblA vector was used to create an NdeI site at the 3′ end of the nblA coding region. The NdeI site was generated by mutagenesis (QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) using plasmid pIC20RnblA as template and the primers QCM23for and QCM24rev. This mutagenesis resulted in the change from Thr63 to a histidine residue and the loss of the two amino acids, Pro64 and Ala65, of the NblA protein. The resulting plasmid pIC20RnblA/NdeI was digested with BglII and NdeI (partial digestion) and subsequently ligated to a fragment harboring the glutathione S-transferase (gst) gene excised from plasmid pGEX-2TK/NdeI (see “Construction of Plasmids for Expression of GST Fusion Proteins”) by NdeI and BamHI digestion. The resultant construct was restricted with EcoRV and, after dephosphorylation, ligated to a PCR fragment bearing the terminator region of the nblA gene, amplified using primers 2.17 (EcoRV and BglII site inserted) and 2.20 (EcoRV site inserted). For schematic representation of construction see supplemental Fig. S1B. Plasmid pIC20RnblAgst-T was verified by DNA sequencing. Restriction with EcoRI yielded a fragment encoding the GST-tagged NblA protein with promoter and terminator regions that was ligated into the self-replicating plasmid pRL1049. The transfer of plasmids between the ΔnblA mutant of Nostoc 7120 and E. coli was attained as described above. Purification of the NblA-GST Fusion Protein from Nostoc 7120—Cultures of the ΔnblA mutant expressing the GST-tagged NblA protein, transferred to BG110 medium (which lacks an N-source) for 6, 8, and 15.5 h, respectively, were harvested by filtration through a nylon net filter (11 μm pore size, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The three pellets (each containing ∼8 mg of chlorophyll) were collected and resuspended in ∼30 ml of sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 7.6), 200 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted in a bead beater (Hamilton Beach) using glass beads of 0.25–0.5 mm. Glass beads and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 4,000 × g. The insoluble fraction consisting of cells, cell fragments, and membranes was removed by two centrifugations (1.5 h, 164,000 × g) and the supernatant incubated with ∼150 μl of Glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (GE Healthcare) in sodium/potassium phosphate buffer overnight at 4 °C with slow agitation. Crude extracts of the ΔnblA mutant expressing the non-tagged NblA served as control. After washing with sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (2 times, 800 μl each), bound proteins were eluted 3 times with 200 μl of 40 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0). Eluates were concentrated by using Vivaspin 500 tubes (Membrane: 5,000 MWCO, Vivascience, New York) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed in slab gels containing 12% (w/v) acrylamide:methylene bisacrylamide (29:1) in the buffer system of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, protein bands were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining (32Doherty N.S. Littman B.H. Reilly K. Swindell A.C. Buss J.M. Anderson N.L. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For protein identification, protein bands of interest were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting as well as by MALDI-MS/MS (33Mattow J. Siejak F. Hagens K. Schmidt F. Köhler C. Treumann A. Schaible U.E. Kaufmann S.H. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 1687-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To this end, protein bands were excised from Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250-stained gels and in-gel digested using porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The resultant proteolytic peptides were desalted and concentrated using ZipTipμ-C18 pipette tips (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) and analyzed with a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Sigma) as a matrix. The MS spectra were recorded in the reflectron mode of the 4700 Proteomics Analyzer and calibrated using trypsin autolysis peaks as internal markers. The MS/MS spectra were acquired without applying collision-induced dissociation. The spectra were processed using the 4700 Explorer software version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The peak lists of the spectra were created by the Peak-to-Mascot script of the 4700 Explorer software using the following filter settings: mass range from 500 to 4,000 Da (MS); 60 Da to precursor mass −20 Da (MS/MS); peak density, ≤10 peaks per 200 Da (MS), ≤20 peaks per 100 Da (MS/MS); minimal signal-to-noise-ratio, 20 (MS), 3 (MS/MS); minimal peak area, 1,000 (MS), 0 (MS/MS); maximal number of peaks per spectrum, 100 (MS, MS/MS). No smoothing was applied and the peaks were not de-isotoped. To allow protein identification, the peak lists of the MS and MS/MS spectra were compared against theoretical mass data deduced from the proteins stored in the Nostoc 7120 data base of The Institute for Genomic Research (Release 7.0; 6128 protein entries). To this end, the search algorithm Mascot version 2.0 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) was used in conjunction with the Mascot Daemon tool version 2.0. The search parameters were as follows: search mode, MS/MS ions search; enzyme, trypsin/P; protein mass, unrestricted; peptide ion mass tolerance, ± 30 ppm; fragment mass tolerance, ± 0.3 Da; maximum number of missed cleavage sites, 1; variable protein/peptide modifications, acetylation of N termini of proteins, modification of cysteines by acrylamide (propionamide), and oxidation of methionines. The primary identification criterion was a significant (p < 0.05) MASCOT search result with a total protein score ≥50. To increase the confidence in protein identification, the data base search results were manually validated, in particular MS/MS identifications based on few peptide assignments. For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. ClpC and NblA-GST fusion protein were detected by specific antisera. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate and SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) as chemiluminescent substrate. Construction of Plasmids for Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—The plasmid for expression of GST-tagged ClpC was constructed as follows: the chromosomal gene alr2999 (29Kaneko T. Nakamura Y.

The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and ligated into the expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) yielding plasmid pGEX-6P/ClpC. For expression of different NblA-GST fusion proteins, the nblA gene or its variants were amplified by PCR from plasmid pIC20RnblA and pIC20RnblA variants using primers 2.5 and 2.15, NdeI sites incorporated. The fragments were cloned into plasmid pGEX-2TK/NdeI to express NblA or NblA variants containing a C-terminal GST tag. The plasmid pGEX-2TK/NdeI was generated by mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using plasmid pGEX-2TK as template and the primers GEXN-For and GEXN-Rev. The α-subunits of phycocyanin (PC) and phycoerythrocyanin (PEC), respectively, were expressed N-terminal fused to a GST tag. For the construction of the expression plasmids, we amplified chromosomal genes cpcA (alr0529, α-subunit of PC) and pecA (alr0524, α-subunit of PEC) by PCR from total Nostoc 7120 DNA using primers pecGEX1 (BamHI site inserted) and pecGEX2 (EcoRI site inserted) or cpcGEX1 (BamHI site inserted) and cpcGEX2 (EcoRI site inserted), respectively. After digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, the PCR fragments were cloned into plasmid pGEX-2TK. All DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The constructs described in this paragraph are depicted in supplemental Fig. S1, C–G. Protein Overexpression, Purification, and in Vitro Binding Assays Using N-terminal GST-tagged NblA—Expression, purification, and site-directed mutagenesis of N-terminal GST-tagged NblA was performed as described earlier (25Bienert R.

After extensive washing, proteins bound to the resins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were performed as described above. PC subunits and GST were detected by specific antisera as described before (25Bienert R. Baier K. Volkmer R. Lockau W. Heinemann U. J.

Protein Overexpression, Purification, and in Vitro Binding Assays Using C-terminal GST-tagged NblA or Its Variants—The C-terminal GST-tagged NblA or its variants were expressed in E. coli after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2–3 h at 30 °C. Fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). The GST-ClpC fusion protein was expressed after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 18 °C. ClpC containing an N-terminal GST tag was bound to Glutathione-Sepharose 4B in sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 200 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm ATP). After washing with buffer, ClpC was eluted by using PreScission™ Protease essentially as described by the manufacturer's directions for GST expression and purification systems (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). NblA-GST was incubated with an equimolar concentration of ClpC (5 μm each) in sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (composition see above) for 2 h at 4 °C with ATP, AMPPNP, ATPγS, ADP, or GTP (each at 5 mm), and subsequently bound to Glutathione-Sepharose 4B overnight at 4 °C. After washing with the sodium/potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mm ATP, AMPPNP, ATPγS, ADP, or GTP, proteins were eluted with 40 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mm ATP, AMPPNP, ATPγS, ADP, or GTP, concentrated using deoxycholate/trichloroacetic acid precipitation (35Bensadoun A.

Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). The in vitro binding assays using the different NblA-GST variants and ClpC were performed by the same procedure except that the incubation buffer contained 5 mm ATP and the washing buffer 0.5–1 mm ATP. The polyclonal anti-ClpC serum was purchased from Agrisera (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden, product number AS01 001). Protein Overexpression, Purification, and in Vitro Binding Assays Using GST-tagged PEC and PC—The N-terminal GST-tagged α-subunits of PC and PEC were expressed after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 18 °C and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare).

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). GST-PEC or GST-PC was incubated with ClpC for 3 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of NblA (each protein at 3 μm) in sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (composition see above) containing 5 mm ATP. Affinity purification of GST-PEC or GST-PC complexes using Glutathione-Sepharose was performed as described above with 0.5 mm ATP in the washing and elution buffers.

https://openalex.org/W2013673778,"Genome-wide analyses in yeast have shown that the switch from mitosis to gamete-forming meiosis is associated with a dramatic change in gene expression profiles. One protein expressed only during meiosis is the cyclin Rem1, which enhances pre-meiotic intragenic recombination and ensures progression through meiosis. Moldón et al. now show that Rem1 expression in the fission yeast Saccharomyces pombe is controlled not only at the level of transcription, but also by splicing. In mitotic cells, binding of the Fkh2 transcription factor to the Rem1 promoter yields a transcript that retains its introns so that only a short protein is produced; this protein affects recombination levels. In meiotic cells, binding of a meiosis-specific transcription factor, Mei4, to the Rem1 promoter results in splicing of Rem1, and the active cyclin. Thus two transcription factors can differentially modify splicing of the same gene. Rem1 expression is controlled not only at the level of transcription, but also by splicing. In mitotic cells, binding of the Fkh2 transcription factor to the rem1 promoter yields a transcript that retains its introns so that only a short protein is produced; this protein affects recombination levels. In meiotic cells, the binding of the meiosis-specific trancription factor Mei4 to the rem1 promoter results in splicing of rem1, yielding the cyclin isoform. Thus, this work demonstrates that two transcription factors can differentially affecting splicing of the same gene. The meiotic cell cycle is modified from the mitotic cell cycle by having a pre-meiotic S phase that leads to high levels of recombination, two rounds of nuclear division with no intervening DNA synthesis and a reductional pattern of chromosome segregation. Rem1 is a cyclin that is only expressed during meiosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Cells in which rem1 has been deleted show decreased intragenic meiotic recombination and a delay at the onset of meiosis I (ref. 1). When ectopically expressed in mitotically growing cells, Rem1 induces a G1 arrest followed by severe mitotic catastrophes. Here we show that rem1 expression is regulated at the level of both transcription and splicing, encoding two proteins with different functions depending on the intron retention. We have determined that the regulation of rem1 splicing is not dependent on any transcribed region of the gene. Furthermore, when the rem1 promoter is fused to other intron-containing genes, the chimaeras show a meiotic-specific regulation of splicing, exactly the same as endogenous rem1. This regulation is dependent on two transcription factors of the forkhead family, Mei4 (ref. 2) and Fkh2 (ref. 3). Whereas Mei4 induces both transcription and splicing of rem1, Fkh2 is responsible for the intron retention of the transcript during vegetative growth and the pre-meiotic S phase."
https://openalex.org/W2115422240,"The majority of plants are unable to evade unfavorable conditions such as flooding, salinity, or drought. Therefore, a fine-tuned water homeostasis appears to be of crucial importance for plant survival, and it was assumed that aquaporins play a significant role in these processes. Regulation of plant aquaporin conductivity was suggested to be achieved by a gating mechanism that involves protein phosphorylation under drought stress conditions and protonation after cytosolic acidification during flooding. The effect of protein phosphorylation or protonation of aquaporins was studied on two plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, NtPIP2;1 and NtAQP1 from tobacco, which were heterologously expressed in yeast. Our results on mutated aquaporins with serine-to-alanine exchange indicate that phosphorylation of the two key serine residues did not affect the pH-dependent modification of water permeability. Protonation on a conserved histidine residue decreased water conductivity of NtPIP2;1. Although cells expressing NtPIP2;1 with a replacement of the histidine by an alanine were found to be pH-insensitive with regard to water permeability, these maintain high water transport rates, similar to those obtained under acidic conditions. The data clearly support the role of histidine at 196 as a component of pH-dependent modification of aquaporin-facilitated water transport. The predictions of combined effects from phosphorylation at conserved serines and histidine protonation were not supported by the results of functional analysis. The obtained results challenge the gating model as a general regulation mechanism for plant plasma membrane aquaporins."
https://openalex.org/W2085212379,"Neurotransmission in the brain is critically dependent on excitatory synaptic signaling mediated by AMPA-class ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). AMPARs are known to be associated with Transmembrane AMPA receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs). In vertebrates, at least four TARPs appear to have redundant roles as obligate chaperones for AMPARs, thus greatly complicating analysis of TARP participation in synaptic function. We have overcome this limitation by identifying and mutating the essential set of TARPs in C. elegans (STG-1 and STG-2). In TARP mutants, AMPAR-mediated currents and worm behaviors are selectively disrupted despite apparently normal surface expression and clustering of the receptors. Reconstitution experiments indicate that both STG-1 and STG-2 can functionally substitute for vertebrate TARPs to modify receptor function. Thus, we show that TARPs are obligate auxiliary subunits for AMPARs with a primary, evolutionarily conserved functional role in the modification of current kinetics."

We investigated the relationship between cell cycle regulation and the anti-apoptosis function of BCL2 and BCL-xL. Neither caspase inhibition nor abrogation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by BAX and BAK deletion fully recapitulated the G0 effects of BCL2 or BCL-xL, suggesting that mechanisms in addition to anti-apoptosis are involved in the cell cycle arrest function of BCL2 or BCL-xL. We found that BCL2 and BCL-xL expression in bax-/- bak-/- cells did not confer cell cycle effects, consistent with the G0 function of BCL2 and BCL-xL being mediated through BAX or BAK. Stabilization of p27 in G0 in BCL2 or BCL-xL cells was due to phosphorylation of p27 at Ser10 by the kinase Mirk. In bax-/- bak-/- cells, total p27 and p27 phosphorylated at Ser10 were elevated. Re-expression of BAX in bax-/- bak-/- cells and silencing of BAX and BAK in wild type cells confirmed that endogenous BAX and BAK modulated p27.

These data revealed a novel role for BAX and BAK in the regulation of G0 quiescence. BCL2 is the prototypical apoptosis regulator, which classically functions as an oncogene in hematopoietic lineages by prolonging survival (1Strasser A. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Cory S.

Therefore, BCL2 can be both oncogenic, because of its anti-apoptotic activity, and tumor suppressive, by blocking proliferation. The coexistence of the anti-apoptosis and the anti-proliferative functions is best illustrated in BCL2 transgenic mice with expression in lymphoid cells. Mice with transgenic BCL2 expression in B or T cells have increased propensity to develop lymphomas (1Strasser A. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Cory S.

At the same time, BCL2 transgenic T cells exhibit anti-proliferative properties, including smaller size, less RNA content, and delay in activation-induced cell cycle entry (9Linette G.P. Li Y.

The mechanistic relationship between the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive functions of BCL2 is not well understood.Cellular quiescence, or the G0 state, is characterized by significantly decreased ribosomal RNA synthesis and lowered total cellular protein content resulting in smaller cell size, compared with cycling cells. G0 parameters can be measured by pyronin Y staining of polyribosomal RNA and forward scatter by flow cytometry (FSC), 4The abbreviations used are: FSC, forward scatter by flow cytometry; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; WT, wild type; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; HA, hemagglutinin; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; C9DN, caspase 9 dominant negative mutant; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 4The abbreviations used are: FSC, forward scatter by flow cytometry; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; WT, wild type; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; HA, hemagglutinin; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; C9DN, caspase 9 dominant negative mutant; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. as well as the marked increase in the protein level of the cdk inhibitor p27. Functionally, cells retained in quiescence take longer to exit G0 and enter G1, exhibiting an anti-proliferative phenotype. Previous studies have shown that expression of BCL2 or BCL-xL significantly lengthens the time for a cell to reach the S phase from the arrested state (9Linette G.P. Li Y. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J.

We and others have found that BCL2 and BCL-xL are unable to delay cell cycle entry in p27-/- cells, identifying p27 as a key molecule in the ability of BCL2 or BCL-xL to exert cell cycle effects (15Greider C. Chattopadhyay A. Parkhurst C. Yang E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7765-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Vairo G. Soos T.J. Upton T.M. Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Koff A. Adams J.M.

Assessment of cell size and RNA content during cell cycle arrest and re-entry suggested that BCL2 or BCL-xL expression retained cells in G0 (17Vairo G. Innes K.M. Adams J.M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which is a major cause of delayed cell cycle entry (18Janumyan Y.M. Sansam C.G. Chattopadhyay A. Cheng N. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Andrews D. Knudson C.M. Yang E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These anti-proliferative functions of BCL2 (and BCL-xL) are thought to be responsible for the tumor-suppressive effect of BCL2 in selected contexts.BCL2 overexpression is a major pathogenic mechanism in lymphomas and leukemias. The identification of BCL2 at the major breakpoint of t(14;18) lymphomas, which resulted in overexpression of BCL2, was key in the discovery of apoptosis inhibition as an oncogenic mechanism (19Tsujimoto Y. Finger L.R. Yunis J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Science. 1984; 226: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 20McDonnell T.J. Deane N. Platt F.M. Nunez G. Jaeger U. McKearn J.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Increased expression of BCL-xL is also a well documented mechanism of therapy resistance. Thus, experiments using overexpression of BCL2 or BCL-xL are physiologically relevant to cancer, especially hematopoietic malignancies. Published data on bcl2-/- T cells demonstrating hastened cell cycle entry provided evidence that regulation of quiescence and cell cycle entry are physiologic functions of endogenous BCL2 (9Linette G.P. Li Y. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9545-9552Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). When studying BCL2 as an oncogene, it is important to understand its cell cycle effects, which must be considered together with its anti-apoptosis functions to fully understand the oncogenic role of BCL2.An important question in understanding the dual role of BCL2 and BCL-xL is whether the cell cycle function is distinct from the anti-apoptotic function or whether the cell cycle activity is a consequence of enhanced survival. In support of the latter possibility, the ability of BCL2 or BCL-xL to raise the threshold at which cells die because of a lack of growth factors may allow cells to further decrease their size and RNA content, which are characteristic of G0. However, increased survival is unlikely to be the only reason for the observed G0 effects of BCL2 and BCL-xL, because transgenic BCL2 or BCL-xL T cells and contact-inhibited BCL2 or BCL-xL-expressing fibroblasts also display characteristics of further entry into G0 when growth factors are not limiting and apoptosis stimuli are absent (10Cheng N. Janumyan Y.M. Didion L. Van Hofwegen C. Yang E. Knudson C.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3770-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Greider C. Chattopadhyay A. Parkhurst C. Yang E.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our published data showed that BCL2 and BCL-xL delayed cell cycle entry stimulated by serum or Myc, but not by E2F1, while protecting Myc-induced and E2F1-induced cell death equally effectively, demonstrating that the cell cycle function of BCL2 and BCL-xL is not always a direct consequence of apoptosis inhibition (15Greider C. Chattopadhyay A. Parkhurst C. Yang E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7765-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis to separate the cell cycle function from the apoptosis function was undertaken, but an extensive mutant analysis of BCL2 or BCL-xL failed to separate the two functions into different protein domains. Instead, mutations that affected the ability of BCL2 or BCL-xL to inhibit apoptosis also attenuated the cell cycle activity of BCL2 or BCL-xL, suggesting that the two functions are mediated through the same target(s) of BCL2 or BCL-xL (18Janumyan Y.M. Sansam C.G. Chattopadhyay A. Cheng N. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Andrews D. Knudson C.M. Yang E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here, we further investigated the relationship between regulation of G0 quiescence and inhibition of apoptosis by BCL2 or BCL-xL.To distinguish whether the cell cycle activity of BCL2 and BCL-xL is a direct consequence of their anti-apoptotic function or is an additional function of BCL2 and BCL-xL, we inhibited cell death by means other than BCL2 or BCL-xL to see whether other methods of enhancing survival can also lead to the same cell cycle effects as seen in BCL2- or BCL-xL-expressing cells. First, we inhibited caspase-dependent cell death and found that the cell cycle phenotype of BCL2 or BCL-xL was not fully recapitulated. Then we asked whether bax-/- bak-/- cells, in which mitochondrial apoptosis is essentially eliminated, exhibited the same cell cycle characteristics as cells with BCL2 or BCL-xL overexpression. We found that the cell cycle function of BCL2 or BCL-xL depended on the presence of BAX and BAK, and bax-/- bak-/- cells have altered p27 regulation, unveiling a role for BAX and BAK in G0 control.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was used for WT and bax-/- bak-/- MEFs (originated in Dr. Craig Thompson's lab), WT and p27S10A knock-in MEFs (gift of Dr. James Roberts), bim-/- MEFs (gift of Dr. Hisashi Harada), Rat1MycER cells, and the human osteosarcoma line 143B.

Two days later, viral supernatants were used to infect fibroblasts or MEFs four times at 2-h intervals. The cells were selected in media containing puromycin (2–4 ;g/ml) or G418 (0.75 mg/ml) 48 h after infection, or green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted on a FACS-Aria.Cell Cycle Analysis—The cells were plated in six-well dishes. For serum starvation, the next day the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in medium containing 0.05% fetal bovine serum for Rat1MycER cells or 0.75% calf serum for NIH3T3 or MEF cells. After 72 h, Rat1MycER cells were stimulated with 1 ;m 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and NIH3T3 cells were stimulated with 10% calf serum. For contact inhibition, the cells were allowed to reach confluence and maintained for 5 days in confluence. To stimulate re-entry into cell cycle, contact-inhibited cells were trypsinized and replated at low density. At the indicated times, the cells were collected and resuspended in Krishan's reagent (0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.02 mg/ml RNase A, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium citrate) and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For BrdU incorporation, at the indicated times, 20 ;m BrdUrd was added to the media for 30 min. The cells were harvested and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, treated with 4 n HCl, neutralized by 0.1 m borax, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated sequentially with anti-BrdUrd antibody (Becton Dickinson) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) in the presence of 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing propidium iodide and RNase A and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were analyzed using Cell Quest.RNA/DNA Staining—Simultaneous 7-amino-actinomycin D and pyronin Y staining was performed according to the protocol of Darzynkiewicz (21Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 401-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and as previously described (18Janumyan Y.M. Sansam C.G. Chattopadhyay A. Cheng N. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Andrews D. Knudson C.M. Yang E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The percentage of reduction in either pyronin Y staining or forward scatter is the difference in mean fluorescence between growing and arrested cells divided by mean fluorescence of growing cells, times 100. For each graph, at least three independent experiments were performed.Immunoblots—The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The antibodies used for immunoblotting were: H-5 (Santa Cruz) or 13.6 (gift from Dr. Lawrence Boise) for BCL-xL, 6C8 for human BCL2 (PharMingen), 652 for BAX (from Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer), 06-536 for BAK (Upstate), K25020 (Transduction Labs) and C-19 (Santa Cruz) for p27, and sc-12939-R for pS10p27 (Santa Cruz). The antibodies for caspase 9 and caspase 3 were from Cell Signaling. Polyclonal Mirk antibody was from Dr. Eileen Friedman's laboratory.Real Time PCR—Syber Green mixture (Applied Biosystems) and icycler (Bio-Rad) was used for p27 real time PCR. The primers used were: p27 sense, 5′-CAG CTT GCC CGA GTT CTA; p27 antisense, 5′-GGG GAA CCG TCT GAA ACA; GAPDH sense, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC; and GAPDH antisense, 5′ TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA. The p27 PCR product was 282 nucleotides, and the GAPDH product was 432 nucleotides. The p27 PCR product was assigned a valued based on the GAPDH concentration curve. The p values were determined using a two-tailed, equal variance Student's t test.Knockdown—For Mirk knockdown, siRNA for human Mirk (GCCUGGUAUUUGAGCUGCUGUCCUA) and control siRNA (GCCUGUAUUAGCGGUUCUGCGUCUA) were purchased from Invitrogen. For knockdown of mouse Mirk, a SMART pool from Dharmacon was used (CUGAUGAACCAGCAUGAUAUU, CAACAGAGCCUACCGAUACUU, GACCAGAUGAGCCGUAUUGUU, and GGACAAAGGAACUCAGGAAUU). Transfections were performed according to the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol. Briefly, per 0.15 × 106 cells in a 6-well dish, 250 pmol of siRNA were diluted in 250 ;l of Opti-MEM, and 5 ;l of Lipofectamine 2000 were diluted in 250 ;l of Opti-MEM. Following a 15-min incubation, the diluted siRNAs and diluted Lipofectamine 2000 were gently mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The siRNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes were added to the cells and incubated for 16 h. The growth medium was replaced, and the cells were allowed to contact inhibit. For BAX and BAK knockdown, BAX and BAK siGenome Smartpool siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol.RESULTSz-VAD-fmk Partially Delayed Cell Cycle Entry but Did Not Affect G0 or Elevate p27—To test whether increasing survival by caspase inhibition results in the same cell cycle arrest phenotype as seen in BCL2- or BCL-xL-expressing cells, we treated cells during cell cycle arrest with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing BCL-xL or empty vector were arrested for 3 days in the presence of z-VAD or DMSO. Although the complete absence of serum induced fibroblast cell death, cells arrested in G0/G1 without significant death (consistently <10%) in the presence of low serum (0.75% for NIH3T3 cells). To test the effect of caspase inhibition during arrest only, z-VAD was applied during incubation in low serum and washed out before the readdition of 10% serum for cell cycle entry. Following cell cycle stimulation with serum, control cells treated with DMSO began to show a significant rise in S phase cells by 10 h, whereas BCL-xL-expressing cells remained in G0/G1 until 14–16 h when a small increase in the S phase became apparent. The cells treated with z-VAD during arrest showed entry into S phase at 12 h, which is intermediate between control and BCL-xL-expressing cells (Fig. 1A). z-VAD rescued cell death in the absence of any serum almost as efficiently as BCL-xL, confirming that caspase inhibition did not fully replicate the cell cycle delay phenotype of BCL-xL despite efficient inhibition of apoptosis (Fig. 1B).To determine whether z-VAD-treated cells exhibited the same G0 parameters as BCL2- or BCL-xL-expressing cells, we stained cells for polyribosomal RNA with pyronin Y and analyzed cells in G0/G1 by gating on cells with 2 n DNA content (18Janumyan Y.M. Sansam C.G. Chattopadhyay A. Cheng N. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Andrews D. Knudson C.M. Yang E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5459-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). BCL-xL cells exhibited a significant reduction in RNA content following cell cycle arrest, as measured by the difference in mean fluorescence intensity between growing cells and arrested cells (40%, p < 0.001), compared with DMSO controls, whereas RNA content of z-VAD-treated cells did not change after cell cycle arrest (p = 0.327) (Fig. 1C). Cell size change, as measured by mean FSC, in z-VAD-treated cells after arrest was no different from DMSO controls (p = 0.74), in comparison with a significant FSC reduction in BCL-xL-expressing cells (20%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1D). Therefore, inhibition of cell death by z-VAD did not reproduce the G0 characteristics of BCL-xL cells.BCL2- and BCL-xL-expressing cells display markedly increased levels of p27 during cell cycle arrest, and the BCL2 and BCL-xL-dependent cell cycle re-entry delay phenotype requires the presence of p27 (15Greider C. Chattopadhyay A. Parkhurst C. Yang E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7765-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Vairo G. Soos T.J. Upton T.M. Zalvide J. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Koff A. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4745-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To determine whether p27 elevation was solely the result of cell death inhibition, we compared p27 levels in control cells and z-VAD-treated cells during arrest (Fig. 1E). As expected, BCL-xL-expressing cells showed increased p27 levels compared with DMSO-treated vector-control cells. However, z-VAD-treated vector cells exhibited levels of p27 comparable with DMSO-treated vector cells, indicating that inhibition of cell death alone did not lead to increased p27. Thus, z-VAD treatment resulted in partial cell cycle delay not accompanied by p27 elevation, and z-VAD did not affect G0.To test the effect of caspase inhibition on cell cycle arrest in another cell type, Rat1MycER cells stably expressing BCL2 or vector were arrested in the presence of z-VAD-fmk or DMSO and stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. BCL2 expression effectively inhibited Myc-induced S phase entry, as expected. z-VAD treatment of vector cells had no effect on Myc-induced cell cycle entry (Fig. 1F), whereas it inhibited cell death almost as well as BCL2 (Fig. 1G). z-VAD-treated vector cells arrested with RNA content and cell size comparable with DMSO-treated vector cells (data not shown). These results showed that caspase inhibition did not exert an effect on G0 or delay cell cycle entry in MycER cells. Taken together with the results from NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1, A–E), we conclude that increasing survival through caspase inhibition cannot be the sole mechanism of the cell cycle function of BCL2 and BCL-xL.Caspase 9 Dominant Negative Mutant Expression Did Not Mimic BCL2 or BCL-xL Expression during Cell Cycle Exit or Entry—Because BCL2 and BCL-xL regulate mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which binds Apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 to form the apoptosome, we used a caspase 9 dominant negative mutant (C9DN) to test whether the inhibition of the apoptosome affects cell cycle arrest (22Cepero E. King A.M. Coffey L.M. Perez R.G. Boise L.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6354-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stable C9DN expression and function in NIH3T3 cells were confirmed by Western blotting for caspase 9 and the absence of cleaved caspase 3 after apoptosis induction, respectively, as well as by inhibition of cell death in serum starvation (Fig. 2A). Cell cycle kinetics of C9DN cells was intermediate between control and BCL-xL-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with z-VAD data, the decrease in RNA content following arrest in C9DN cells was not statistically different from vector cells (20%, p = 0.154), whereas BCL-xL expressing cells showed significantly more reduction in RNA content than vector cells (42%, p = 0.012) (Fig. 2C). The decrease in mean FSC of C9DN cells after arrest tended to be greater than vector cells, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.112) (Fig. 2D). The level of p27 in arrested C9DN cells was similar to vector cells, whereas BCL-xL-expressing cells up-regulated p27 to a much higher level (Fig. 2E).FIGURE 2C9DN partially delays cell cycle entry but does not affect measurements of G0 arrest in NIH3T3 cells. A, lysates of cells overexpressing dominant negative caspase 9 (C9DN) or BCL-xL induced to die by serum withdrawal for 24 h were immunoblotted for caspase 9 and caspase 3. B, S phase progression of cells arrested in 0.75% serum for 3 days and stimulated to enter cell cycle by 10% serum readdition were measured by propidium iodide staining. Asynchronously growing and arrested NIH3T3 cells were collected and assayed for RNA content by pyronin Y staining (C), cell size by FSC (D; black, asynchronously growing cells; blue, arrested vector control cells; green, arrested C9DN cells; red, arrested BCL-xL cells), and p27 protein levels by Western blotting (E). Except for cell death assays, all of the cell cycle measurements were gated on live cells. For C and D, representative FACS profiles are shown, and graphs with standard errors show the percent change in mean fluorescence of at least three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the effect of caspase 9 inhibition in another system of cell cycle arrest and re-entry, C9DN was expressed in Rat1MycER cells (Fig. 3, A and B). C9DN expression had no effect on RNA content, cell size reduction, or p27 levels during cell cycle exit (Fig. 3, D–F). Whereas C9DN had an intermediate effect on serum-induced cell cycle entry, it had no effect on Myc-induced G0 to S transition (Fig. 3C). Thus, the cell cycle effects of BCL-xL or BCL2 during cell cycle arrest and re-entry could not be fully reproduced by C9DN expression in either NIH3T3 or Rat1MycER fibroblasts.FIGURE 3C9DN does not affect cell cycle entry or G0 arrest in Rat1MycER cells. A, lysates of cells overexpressing C9DN or BCL2 induced to die by serum withdrawal for 24 h were immunoblotted for caspase 9 and caspase 3. B, cell death of Rat1MycER cells expressing vector, C9DN, or BCL2 after complete serum deprivation for 24 h was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. C, cells were arrested in 0.05% fetal calf serum medium for 3 days and stimulated to enter cell cycle by 1 ;m 4-hydroxytamoxifen addition, and S phase cells were measured by BrdU pulse labeling. Asynchronously growing and arrested Rat1MycER cells were assayed for RNA content by pyronin Y staining (D), cell size by FSC (E; black, asynchronously growing cells; blue, arrested vector control cells; green, arrested C9DN cells; red, arrested BCL2 cells), and p27 protein levels by Western blotting (F). Except for cell death assays, all of the cell cycle measurements were gated on live cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data from Figs. 1, 2, 3 showed that even though z-VAD and C9DN both effectively inhibited apoptosis, neither changed cell cycle arrest, as measured by pyronin Y staining, FSC, or p27 level, in the manner of BCL2 or BCL-xL expression. The only cell cycle effect of z-VAD or C9DN was partial delay of cell cycle re-entry under some circumstances. Although BCL2 or BCL-xL expression inhibited apoptosis and retained cells in G0, caspase inhibition effectively protected cells against apoptosis but did not result in cells entering a quiescence state.Bax-/- Bak-/- Cells Exhibit Altered Cell Cycle Arrest and Are Insensitive to the Cell Cycle Effects of BCL2 or BCL-xL Expression—BCL2 and BCL-xL regulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, which includes both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death. One reason that the inhibition of caspases did not promote G0 arrest could be that caspase-independent pathways of cell death continued to function. To inhibit all cell death emanating from the mitochondria, we used cells lacking both BAX and BAK (23Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P.

Wild type and bax-/- bak-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (DKO MEFs) were plated at high density and allowed to reach confluence (Fig. 4). No significant cell death was observed in contact-inhibited cultures (Fig. 4A, table). We compared contact-inhibited bax-/- bak-/- MEFs with wild type cells expressing BCL2 or BCL-xL in terms of pyronin Y staining, FSC, and p27 levels. We found that the reductions in cell size and RNA content of bax-/- bak-/- cells during density arrest were intermediate between wild type cells expressing vector and wild type cells expressing BCL2 or BCL-xL, indicating that the absence of BAX and BAK was not equivalent to BCL2 overexp"

NOS contain a unique Trp residue whose side chain stacks with the heme and hydrogen bonds with the heme thiolate. To understand its importance we substituted His for Trp188 in the inducible NOS oxygenase domain (iNOSoxy) and characterized enzyme spectral, thermodynamic, structural, kinetic, and catalytic properties. The W188H mutation had relatively small effects on l-Arg binding and on enzyme heme-CO and heme-NO absorbance spectra, but increased the heme midpoint potential by 88 mV relative to wild-type iNOSoxy, indicating it decreased heme-thiolate electronegativity. The protein crystal structure showed that the His188 imidazole still stacked with the heme and was positioned to hydrogen bond with the heme thiolate. Analysis of a single turnover l-Arg hydroxylation reaction revealed that a new heme species formed during the reaction. Its build up coincided kinetically with the disappearance of the enzyme heme-dioxy species and with the formation of a tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) radical in the enzyme, whereas its subsequent disappearance coincided with the rate of l-Arg hydroxylation and formation of ferric enzyme. We conclude: (i) W188H iNOSoxy stabilizes a heme-oxy species that forms upon reduction of the heme-dioxy species by H4B. (ii) The W188H mutation hinders either the processing or reactivity of the heme-oxy species and makes these steps become rate-limiting for l-Arg hydroxylation.

All three are comprised of a flavoprotein domain that is linked to a heme-containing oxygenase domain by an intervening calmodulin binding sequence.

Some of the distal side differences enable NOS to accommodate its substrate l-Arg, whereas the proximal side differences appear to tune the electronic and catalytic properties of the heme. For example, the proximal heme binding loop in NOS enzymes is 1 residue shorter than in cytochrome P450s (supplemental Fig. 1) and contains a conserved tryptophan residue (Trp409 in rat nNOS, Trp188 in mouse iNOS) that makes a stacking interaction with the heme and provides a side chain hydrogen bond to the cysteine heme thiolate (supplemental Fig. 1). The homologous residue in the cytochrome P450 superfamily is, with a few exceptions, a phenylalanine that cannot form a hydrogen bond (16Ost T.W. Miles C.S. Munro A.W. Murdoch J. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and so the proximal loop peptide backbone contributes all the hydrogen bonds to the cysteine thiolate in cytochrome P450 (17Poulos T.L.

Likewise, we previously reported that removal of the hydrogen bond provided by Trp409 in nNOS significantly altered the properties and reactivity of its heme, as judged by results obtained with the W409F nNOS mutant (19Adak S.

As described herein, we found that W188H iNOSoxy stabilizes an enzyme reaction intermediate during l-Arg hydroxylation that forms downstream from the ferrous-dioxy species (I in Fig. 1) and normally does not build up in wild-type enzyme.

Mutated plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells using the TransformAid bacterial transformation kit (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). Protein Expression and Purification—The Δ65iNOSoxy W188H mutant with a His6 tag at the C terminus was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) using a modified pCWori vector.

UV-visible spectra of ferric, ferrous enzyme, and complexes were recorded in either a Cary 100 or a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. Redox Potentiometry—Redox titrations were carried out in a glove box (Belle Technology, Dorset, UK) under nitrogen atmosphere as previously described (23Konas D.W. Takaya N. Sharma M. Stuehr D.J.

Protein sample (final concentration ≈10 μm) was made anaerobic by gel filtration in a Sephadex G-25 column (PD10, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with anaerobic buffer (potassium phosphate, 0.1 m, pH 7.0, 125 mm NaCl). After elution, the samples were diluted to a 7-ml final volume and H4B (25 μm) and l-Arg (2.5 mm) was added. Measurements were carried out at 15 ± 1 °C. Absorption spectra were recorded in Cary 50 using a dip probe detector, and the potentials were monitored using an Accumet AB15 (Fisher Scientific) coupled to a silver/silver chloride electrode saturated with 4 m KCl. Redox mediators (Sigma) 1–5 μm anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (Em -225 mV), phenosafranine (Em -252 mV), and benzyl viologen (Em -358 mV) (Em, midpoint redox potential) were used.

Fractions oxidized for each spectra were calculated from the maximum difference between oxidized and reduced spectra (around 430 and 390 nm). Using these data and the corresponding measured potentials (versus SHE) the midpoint potential of the half-reaction can be determined using the Nernst equation (Equation 1), E=Em+RTnF2.303log[Oxidized][Reduced](Eq. 1) where E is the measured equilibrium potential at each titration point, R is the gas constant (8.314 J·mol-1 K-1), T is the experimental temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons in the half-reaction, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C/mol), and [Oxidized]/[Reduced] is the ratio of oxidized to reduced species. Crystal Growth, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement— Crystals of murine W188H-iNOSoxy Δ65 (residues 66–498) were grown at 4 °C using the hanging drop method as described in Ref. 10Crane B.R.

The W188H iNOSoxy concentration was 18–20 mg/ml in 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6) containing 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm H4B, and 10 mm l-Arg. The reservoir contained 0.46–0.74 m Li2SO4, 100 mm MES (pH 4.9–5.9), and 5% β-octyl glucoside. 1.0 μl of protein was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and crystals were grown in 5–8 days. Instead of Li2SO4, we used 0.7–1.2 m (NH4)2SO4 in the reservoir solution and we found that crystals were grown in 3–6 days. Crystals were frozen using 30% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant. Several iNOS W188H crystal data sets were collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 4.2.2, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using d*TREK (28Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar).

The refined structure has no Ramachandran violations. Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table 2. l-Arg and Imidazole Binding—l-Arg and imidazole binding affinity was studied at 25 °C by difference spectroscopy (32McMillan K. Masters B.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). iNOS samples (around 5 μm) in 40 mm EPPS buffer (pH 7.6) with 10% glycerol, and 100 μm H4B were titrated with either l-Arg or imidazole (final concentration 400–800 μm). The Kd of l-Arg was calculated by fitting of the absorbance difference versus the substrate concentration. Single Turnover Reactions—l-Arg hydroxylation experiments were carried out in a Hi-Tech SF61-DX2 stopped-flow instrument (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) coupled to a diode array detector, as previously described (33Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12830-12837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reaction was studied in the presence of 50 μm H4B or 100 μm H2B, 1 mm l-Arg, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol in 40 mm EPPS buffer (pH 7.6). 10 μm iNOSoxy was titrated with sodium dithionite and mixed with air-saturated buffer at room temperature ([O2] ≈ 280 μm). Sequential spectral data were fitted to A → B → C and A → B → C → D models using the Specfit/32 global analysis software, version 3.0 (Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA), which calculates the spectra of the different enzyme species and their concentration change versus time. Rapid-freeze Kinetic Experiments—Ferrous iNOS samples prepared by titrating ferric protein solutions with sodium dithionite as described above were transferred with an anaerobic syringe to a rapid quench instrument (RQF-63, Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) maintained at 10 °C and the samples were rapidly mixed with an O2-saturated buffer (40 mm EPPS, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) to initiate the reaction. The reaction mixture was then aged for various times in the instrument followed by rapid injection into a liquid N2/isopentane freezing solution as described elsewhere (34Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q.

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance—EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300E electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer equipped with an EIP Model 28B microwave frequency counter. All spectra were obtained at 150 K using a microwave power of 2 milliwatts, microwave frequency of 9.45 GHz, modulation amplitude of 5.0 G, and modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Ten scans per sample were accumulated to improve signal to noise ratio, and spin quantitations were calculated by double integration. Rapid-quench Experiments—We performed these experiments as previously described (34Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, an anaerobic solution of 100 μm ferrous wild-type iNOSoxy, 130 μm l-Arg, 0.5 mm H4B, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol in 40 mm EPPS, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6) was mixed at 10 °C with a syringe containing oxygen-saturated 40 mm EPPS, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6), and 150 μm l-Arg. The quenching solution was 1.0 n HCl, in all cases. For W188H iNOSoxy the protein and l-Arg concentrations were 150 and 200 μm, respectively. Quenched reaction samples were collected and stored at -70 °C. To determine the final dilution factors the protein samples included 200 μm l-glutamic acid as an internal standard. Determination of Reaction Products by HPLC—l-Arg, NOHA, and citrulline in the rapid-quench samples were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde and quantified by HPLC as described previously (36Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A complete procedure is provided under supplementary materials. Stoichiometry of l-Arg Hydroxylation—A solution containing 1 mm wild-type iNOSoxy or W188H, 3 mm l-Arg, 1.0 mm H4B, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl in 40 mm EPPS buffer (pH 7.6) was made anaerobic and titrated with sodium dithionite to produce the ferrous enzyme. Different amounts of these stock solutions were mixed with air-saturated buffer containing 3 mm l-Arg, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl in 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6) at room temperature. For completion of the reaction, these solution mixtures were incubated for 10 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 5 μl of 1.0 n HCl to the reaction mixtures (total volume 100 μl) and the samples were stored at -70 °C. NOHA formed in these samples were estimated using the above described HPLC method. Steady-state Assays—NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation rates were determined using the oxyhemoglobin assay (22Panda K. Haque M.M. Garcin-Hosfield E.D. Durra D. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36819-36827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The NO synthesis activity was determined by the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin using an extinction coefficient of 38 mm-1 cm-1 at 401 nm. The NADPH oxidation rates were determined following the absorbance at 340 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm-1 cm-1. Reaction mixtures (total volume 400 μl) contained ≤0.2 μm iNOS, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 4 μm H4B, 10 mm l-Arg, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 μm calmodulin, 100 units/ml catalase, 60 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 μm oxyhemoglobin, and 150 mm NaCl in 40 mm EPPS buffer (pH 7.6). The reaction was initiated by adding NADPH to a final concentration of 250 μm. All steady-state assays were carried out at 25 °C. Protein Expression, Spectroscopic Properties, and Substrate Binding—The expression level of W188H iNOSoxy was similar to wild-type and the mutant contained bound heme, which is remarkable because another substitution at this site in iNOSoxy (W188F) was reported to generate a predominantly heme-free protein (38Wilson D.J. Rafferty S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra of W188H iNOSoxy are shown in Fig. 2. In the absence of H4B and l-Arg the mutant enzyme had a 417-nm Soret band, indicating a low-spin ferric heme. Addition of H4B and l-Arg shifted the Soret maximum to 396 nm, indicating a predominant high-spin character as occurs in wild-type iNOSoxy (39Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequier N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Spectra of the FeII-CO, FeII-NO, and FeIII-NO complexes of W188H iNOSoxy are similar but not identical to wild-type (Fig. 2 and Table S1). The Kd for l-Arg in W188H iNOSoxy was determined using a spectroscopic assay to be 29 ± 3 μm, which is roughly 20 times greater than the wild-type Kd value of 1.3 ± 0.9 μm determined under identical conditions. Together, this indicates that the hemethiolate ligation is intact in W188H iNOSoxy, but its heme electronic environment and substrate binding affinity have some detectable differences compared with wild-type. Crystal Structure of W188H iNOSoxy—We obtained a crystal structure of W188H iNOSoxy at 2.8-Å resolution. Parameters are reported in supplemental Table S2. Overall, the structure of the mutant is highly similar to wild-type iNOSoxy. Fig. 3 focuses on the heme structural environments of W188H and wild-type iNOSoxy. In the mutant, the His188 imidazole side chain is positioned below the heme and in the space that is normally occupied by the Trp188 side chain in native iNOSoxy. The imidazole ring of His188 makes a stacking interaction with the porphyrin ring, and its Nϵ atom is positioned within a similar H-bonding distance to the heme thiolate as is the indole nitrogen of Trp188 in wild-type iNOSoxy. The porphyrin ring appears to be bent in a similar manner in both mutant and wild-type structures, although the iron atom appears to lie more in-plane with the porphyrin ring in the mutant enzyme. These structural features are consistent with our biochemical/biophysical measurements on W188H iNOSoxy. Redox Potentiometry—One possible impact of the W188H mutation is an effect on the heme midpoint potential. We therefore compared the ferric/ferrous heme midpoint potentials of our W188H and wild-type iNOSoxy proteins in the presence of H4B and l-Arg. Data from representative spectroelectrochemical titrations are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated Em value for the wild-type iNOSoxy was -261 ± 2 mV, in good agreement with previous values (-263 mV (40Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and -270 mV (41Gao Y.T. Smith S.M. Weinberg J.B. Montgomery H.J. Newman E. Guillemette J.G. Ghosh D.K. Roman L.J. Martasek P. Salerno J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) obtained at 25 °C. The W188H mutant had a heme midpoint potential of -173 ± 2 mV, which is an +88 mV increase over wild type. Thus, substituting His for Trp188 in iNOSoxy caused a significant increase in the ferric/ferrous heme midpoint potential. Stopped-flow Analysis of a Single Turnover l-Arg Hydroxylation—We next studied heme transitions that occur in W188H iNOSoxy during catalysis of Arg hydroxylation under single turnover conditions. The W188H iNOSoxy protein was saturated with l-Arg and H4B, reduced with dithionite under anaerobic conditions, and then mixed in a stopped-flow instrument with air-saturated buffer containing l-Arg and H4B to start the reaction. Replica reactions with wild-type iNOSoxy were run for comparison. Diode array spectra were collected over the course of each reaction, and subject to global analysis. We found the l-Arg hydroxylation reaction of W188H iNOSoxy to be more complex than that of wild-type iNOSoxy. A three-species, two consecutive transition model that typically provides a good fit for the wild-type reaction (34Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Equation 2), Fe||→Fe||O2→F|||(Eq. 2) led to considerable error in the case of W188H iNOSoxy. However, a four-species, three consecutive transition model that includes formation of a new intermediate after the heme-dioxy species could achieve an accurate fit (Equation 3). Fe||→Fe||O2→intermediate→Fe|||(Eq. 3) Visual analysis of the collected spectral scans confirmed the appearance of a new intermediate at this point in the reaction (data not shown). The calculated spectrum of each W188H iNOSoxy heme species, and the time courses of their formation and/or disappearance during the Arg hydroxylation reaction, are shown in Fig. 5. The calculated transition rates are summarized in Table 1 and compared with rates we obtained in a wild-type iNOSoxy reaction. The formation rate of the hemedioxy complex was relatively fast and was similar for either protein. Formation of the new heme intermediate in W188H iNOSoxy coincided with the disappearance of its heme dioxy complex (species I in Fig. 1). Buildup of the new intermediate implies that the W188H mutation stabilizes a heme-oxy species that forms downstream from the heme-dioxy species but normally does not build up during the l-Arg hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by iNOSoxy (34Wei C.C.

However, the regulatory mechanism of MIF function is unclear. Here we report that the NM23-H1 interacts with MIF in cells, as demonstrated by cotransfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Analysis of cysteine (Cys) to serine (Ser) substitution mutants of NM23-H1 (C4S, C109S, and C145S) and MIF (C57S, C60S, and C81S) revealed that Cys145 of NM23-H1 and Cys60 of MIF are responsible for complex formation. NM23-H1-MIF complexes were dependent on reducing conditions, such as the presence of dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol, but not H2O2. NM23-H1 alleviated the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by promoting the dissociation of MIF from MIF-p53 complexes. In addition, NM23-H1 significantly inhibited the MIF-induced proliferation of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells through a direct interaction with MIF, and decreased the MIF-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PDK1 and p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase.

In addition, recent studies strongly suggest that MIF is linked to tumorigenesis through its ability to suppress p53 activity (4Hudson J. Shoaibi M.A. Maestro R. Carnero A. Hannon G.J. Beach D.H. J.

Recent studies suggest that MIF is a potent regulator of p53- and AP-1 activity, however, the regulatory mechanism of MIF function in cells is largely unknown (5Fingerle-Rowson G. Petrenko O.

One way to elucidate the mechanism of MIF function is to analyze the role of MIF-interacting proteins in the regulation of MIF activity. NM23-H1 was first classified as a metastasis suppressor gene on the basis of its reduced expression in several metastatic melanoma cell lines as compared with their non-metastatic counterparts (10Steeg P.S.

Overexpression of NM23-H1 in various cancer cell lines has been linked to the suppression of tumor metastasis, and differentiation (10Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P.

Despite considerable effort, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of NM23 proteins in these cellular processes are not well understood, even though a diverse set of enzymatic activities have been ascribed to NM23 proteins, including nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activity (20Wallet V.

In the current study, we demonstrated that NM23-H1 and MIF physically interact, and that the interaction is mediated by cysteine residues in both proteins. We also present evidence that the suppression of p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by MIF is alleviated by the direct interaction of NM23-H1 with MIF, and that NM23-H1 inhibits the MIF-induced cell proliferation of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells by binding to MIF. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Reagents—293T, HEK293, MCF7, NIH 3T3, HCT116, and p53-null HCT116 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), as described previously (26Jung H.

For immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis, anti-MIF, anti-p53, anti-MDM2, and anti-NM23-H1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). In Vivo and In Vitro Binding Assays—Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors using WelFect-Ex™ Plus (WelGENE, Daegu, Korea), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vivo and in vitro binding assays were performed as previously described (26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol.

Preparation of Recombinant NM23-H1 and MIF Proteins—Expression vectors for recombinant hexahistidine (His)6-tagged human wild-type NM23-H1 or GST-tagged wild-type and mutant MIF were constructed by subcloning the appropriate cDNA fragments of NM23-H1 and MIF into pQE30 (Qiagen) or pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a His-Bind Resin column (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA) or a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (16Jung H.

Reporter Assays—MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors together with a reporter plasmid encoding p53-Luc using WelFect-Ex Plus, according to the manufacturer's instructions. An expression vector for β-galactosidase was also transfected into cells as an internal control. Empty vector was added to each transfection to ensure that the total amount of DNA was the same in each experiment. Luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's protocol, as described previously (29Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T.

The values were adjusted with respect to expression levels of a cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter control. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. RNA Interference Experiments—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments were performed using NM23-H1-specific siRNAs (number 1, 5′-GGAGAUCGGCUUGUGGUUUTT-3′; number 2, 5′-GCUUCCGAAGAUCUUCUCATT-3′) and MIF-specific siRNAs (number 1, 5′-ACACCAACGUGCCCCGCGCdTdT-3′; number 2, 5′-CCUUCUGGUGGGGAGAAAUdTdT-3′) (15Seong H.-A.

Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35293-35307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, p53-null HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for p53, wild-type, and mutant forms of NM23-H1, wild-type MIF, and hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin, as indicated, using WelFect-Ex Plus. After 44 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml MG132 (Calbiochem) for 4 h, and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2% SDS, and then the lysates were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by incubation with anti-p53 antibody. Apoptosis Assay—The apoptosis assay was performed as described previously (29Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF7 cells grown on sterile coverslips were transfected with an expression vector encoding green fluorescent protein, together with the indicated expression vectors. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 5-fluorouracil (0.38 mm) for 30 h, fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol, and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), and nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells. Immunofluorescence Staining and FACS Analysis—Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (15Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For FACS analysis for cell cycle distribution (26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20383-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), transfectants of MCF7 cells expressing the indicated proteins, together with transfectants expressing p53 alone or empty vector as a control, were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then treated with doxorubicin (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. The trypsinized cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with a solution (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 1 mg/ml RNase A. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur-S system (BD Biosciences). Proliferation Assay—Proliferation was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells per dish and cultured for 24 h. The cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using WelFect-Ex Plus, and then cultured for an additional 12–15 h in 10% FBS-containing DMEM. The cells then were re-seeded in 6-well plates at 4–5 × 104 cells per well and allowed to attach for 8 h in 10% FBS-containing DMEM, after which the medium was replaced with 0.5% FBS-containing DMEM. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and viable cells were counted with a hemocytometer at the indicated times. NM23-H1 Interacts with MIF in Vivo—NM23-H1 and MIF have been shown to interact with p53 (16Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35293-35307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20383-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether NM23-H1 interacted with MIF in the absence of p53, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for GST-NM23-H1 and FLAG-MIF, and the interaction between NM23-H1 and MIF in GST precipitates was analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, MIF was detected in GST precipitates, which suggested that MIF physically interacts with NM23-H1 in cells. To determine whether endogenous NM23-H1 and MIF interacted with each other, the in vivo association of the two proteins was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation using an anti-NM23-H1 antibody, or preimmune IgG as a control. Endogenous MIF was present in anti-NM23-H1 immune complexes from all cell lines examined, including 293T, HEK293, and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1B). The interaction was also detected in reciprocal experiments in which the immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-MIF antibody (data not shown). To determine the subcellular localization of NM23-H1 and MIF, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed using HCT116 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-NM23-H1 and GST-MIF. Both NM23-H1 and MIF were distributed mainly in the cytoplasm and colocalized with each other, as seen in the merged image in Fig. 1C. These results demonstrated that NM23-H1 physically associates with MIF in vivo. Requirement of Cysteine Residues for NM23-H1-MIF Complex Formation—Cysteine residues of NM23-H1 have been shown to participate in STRAP binding (15Seong H.-A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the interaction of both NM23-H1 and MIF with p53 is mediated by cysteine residues (16Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35293-35307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20383-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NM23-H1-MIF interaction involved cysteine residues in both proteins, and to investigate the effect of cysteine residues of MIF on NM23-H1-MIF complex formation, HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with expression vectors for wild-type MIF or MIF Cys substitution mutants (C57S, C60S, or C81S), together with wild-type NM23-H1, and complex formation was analyzed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by immunoblot using an anti-FLAG antibody. The coexpression of MIF(C60S) with NM23-H1 resulted in a significant decrease in complex formation as compared with wild-type MIF, whereas the level of binding of the other MIF mutants (C57S and C81S) was similar to wild-type MIF (Fig. 2A, left). These results suggested that Cys60 of MIF plays a critical role in its association with NM23-H1. We next examined whether cysteine residues (Cys4, Cys109, and Cys145) of NM23-H1 were involved in complex formation between NM23-H1 and MIF. Coexpression of NM23-H1(C145S) resulted in a significant decrease in complex formation between NM23-H1 and MIF, as compared with control cells expressing wild-type NM23-H1, whereas coexpression of NM23-H1(C4S) and NM23-H1(C109S) had no effect (Fig. 2A, middle). These results indicated that Cys145 of NM23-H1 is responsible for MIF binding. To verify that the dramatic decrease in the association between NM23-H1 and MIF was due to substitutions of NM23-H1-Cys145 and MIF-Cys60, we performed an in vivo binding assay of NM23-H1(C145S) and MIF(C60S) in HEK293 cells. The coexpression of NM23-H1(C145S) and MIF(C60S) completely abrogated complex formation between NM23-H1 and MIF (Fig. 2A, right). We also carried out non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm the association between NM23-H1 and MIF in vitro. Purified NM23-H1 was subjected to autophosphorylation using radiolabeled ATP, then incubated with unlabeled, recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of MIF. As shown in Fig. 2B, a shift in the mobility of autophosphorylated NM23-H1 was clearly evident upon incubation in the presence of wild-type MIF, MIF(C57S), and MIF(C81S), but was undetectable in the presence of MIF(C60S). These results provided additional evidence of the physical association of NM23-H1 and MIF through cysteine residues. To determine whether the interaction between NM23-H1 and MIF was redox-dependent, we performed in vivo binding assays under a variety of reducing and oxidizing conditions in HEK293 and MCF7 cells. The presence of the reductants dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol markedly decreased the amount of endogenous MIF that coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous NM23-H1, whereas the oxidant H2O2 had no effect (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that the in vivo association of NM23-H1 with MIF is redox-dependent. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that cysteine residues, particularly Cys145 of NM23-H1 and Cys60 of MIF, play an essential role in the association of NM23-H1 and MIF in vivo. Regulation of NM23-H1-MIF Complex Formation by 5-FU and Doxorubicin—The p53 activity is induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and doxorubicin (30Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7598-7605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and MIF has been shown to inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20383-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether 5-FU and doxorubicin influenced NM23-H1-MIF complex formation, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for GST-NM23-H1 and FLAG-MIF, and then treated with 5-FU or doxorubicin, and the association of NM23-H1 and MIF was analyzed by immunoblot. Complex formation between NM23-H1 and MIF was considerably increased in 5-FU- or doxorubicin-treated cells as compared with control, untreated cells (Fig. 3). These data indicated that the interaction between NM23-H1 and MIF is dependent on p53 stimulation by 5-FU or doxorubicin. NM23-H1 Alleviates MIF-mediated Suppression of p53-induced Transcription by Destabilizing MIF-p53 Complexes—MIF forms a complex with p53 and suppresses p53-induced transcription (26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20383-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether NM23-H1 affected the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced transcription, MCF7 cells were cotransfected with an expression vector for MIF, and increasing amounts of expression vectors for wild-type NM23-H1 or NM23-H1 mutants, together with the p53-Luc reporter plasmid, in the presence or absence of p53. The expression of wild-type NM23-H1, NM23-H1(C4S), or NM23-H1(C109S) significantly abrogated the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced transcription in a dose-dependent manner, as compared with control cells that expressed MIF alone in the presence of p53 (Fig. 4A, lane 3 versus lanes 4–6). In contrast, the expression of NM23-H1(C145S) had no effect on p53-induced transcription, which indicated that the direct interaction of NM23-H1 with MIF is critical for the NM23-H1-mediated rescue of p53-induced transcription in the presence of MIF. However, these results did not rule out the possibility that the rescue of p53-induced transcription by NM23-H1 was due to a direct association between NM23-H1 and p53, because it has been shown that NM23-H1 physically interacts with p53 and stimulates p53-mediated transcription (16Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35293-35307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test this, cells were transfected with an expression vector for MIF(C60S), which was unable to interact with NM23-H1 but can bind to p53 (26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20383-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and p53-induced transcription was assessed in the presence of wild-type and mutant forms of NM23-H1. The stimulation of p53-induced transcription by wild-type NM23-H1, NM23-H1(C4S), or NM23-H1(C109S) was lower in cells that expressed MIF(C60S) as compared with wild-type MIF (Fig. 4B, white bars versus black bars). The stimulatory effect of NM23-H1 was completely abrogated in cells that expressed NM23-H1(C145S) in the presence of either wild-type MIF or MIF(C60S). These results suggested that, in addition to the direct interaction between NM23-H1 and MIF, the direct binding of NM23-H1 to p53 also contributes, although to a somewhat lesser extent, to the rescue of p53-induced transcription in the presence of MIF. To investigate the mechanism of regulation of the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced transcription by NM23-H1, we examined the effect of NM23-H1 on the association between MIF and p53, because MIF inhibits p53 activity through a direct interaction with p53 (26Jung H. Seong H.-A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20383-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for MIF and p53 in the presence or absence of the wild-type and mutant form of NM23-H1. Compared with control cells expressing MIF and p53 in the absence of NM23-H1, the expression of wild-type NM23-H1, NM23-H1(C4S), or NM23-H1(C109S) significantly decreased the association between MIF and p53 (Fig. 4C, left). In contrast, NM23-H1(C145S), which is unable to bind to p53 or MIF, had no effect on the association of MIF and p53, which indicated that NM23-H1 alleviates the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced transcription by dissociating MIF from MIF-p53 complexes. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the diminished effect of NM23-H1 on p53-induced transcription in the presence of MIF(C60S), we analyzed the effect of NM23-H1 on the association of MIF(C60S) and p53 using an in vivo binding assay. The coexpression of wild-type NM23-H1, NM23-H1(C4S), or NM23-H1(C109S) slightly diminished the association between MIF(C60S) and p53, most likely due to the failure of NM23-H1 to associate with MIF(C60S), even though the physical interaction between NM23-H1 and p53 was still present, whereas NM23-H1(C145S) had no effect on the association between MIF(C60S) and p53 (Fig. 4C, right). NM23-H1 Alleviates the MIF-mediated Suppression of p53-induced Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest through Direct Binding to MIF—To determine whether the expression of NM23-H1 affected p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the presence of MIF, we first examined the effect of wild-type and mutant forms of NM23-H1 on the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced apoptosis using a GFP-based assay system in MCF7 cells. In cells that expressed p53 alone, ∼42% of the cells were apoptotic (Fig. 5A, upper, second lane). The coexpression of wild-type NM23-H1, NM23-H1(C4S), or NM23-H1(C109S) with wild-type MIF considerably increased the percentage of apoptotic cells by ∼1.8-fold relative to control cells that expressed wild-type MIF alone (Fig. 5A, upper, lane 3 versus lanes 4–6). The coexpression of NM23-H1(C145S) had no effect on the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced apoptosis. The stimulatory effect of NM23-H1 on p53-induced apoptosis in the presence of MIF(C60S) was less pronounced than in the presence of wild-type MIF (Fig. 5A, upper, lanes 3 and 8 versus lanes 4–6 and 9–11), which was consistent with earlier results (Fig. 4B). We also examined whether NM23-H1 affected the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced cell cycle arrest. G0/G1 arrest induced by p53 was lower in cells that expressed wild-type NM23-H1, NM23-H1(C4S), or NM23-H1(C109S) in the prese"
https://openalex.org/W1984228574,"Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) is a ribosome-inactivating protein isolated from the pokeweed plant (Phytolacca americana) that exhibits antiviral activity against several plant and animal viruses. We have shown previously that PAP depurinates Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs in vitro and that prior incubation of these RNAs with PAP reduced their synthesis in barley protoplasts. To investigate the post-transcriptional effect of PAP on viral RNA in vivo, we transcribed BMV RNA3 and expressed PAP in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a surrogate host for BMV. With an inducible transcription system, we show that the half-life of RNA3 in PAP-expressing cells was significantly less than in cells expressing PAPx, its enzymatically inactive form. PAP bound to RNA3 and depurinated the RNA within open reading frames 3 and 4 and within untranslated regions of the RNA. The depurinated RNA was associated with polysomes, caused ribosomes to stall at the point of depurination, and was targeted for accelerated degradation by components of the No-go decay pathway. As a consequence of translation elongation arrest and increased RNA degradation, expression of PAP in yeast also decreased the level of protein 3a, encoded by the 5′-proximal open reading frame 3 of BMV RNA3. These data provide the first evidence of viral RNA depurination in vivo by any ribosome-inactivating protein and support our hypothesis that depurination contributes to the antiviral activity of PAP, by enhancing viral RNA degradation and reducing translation of viral protein product. Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) is a ribosome-inactivating protein isolated from the pokeweed plant (Phytolacca americana) that exhibits antiviral activity against several plant and animal viruses. We have shown previously that PAP depurinates Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs in vitro and that prior incubation of these RNAs with PAP reduced their synthesis in barley protoplasts. To investigate the post-transcriptional effect of PAP on viral RNA in vivo, we transcribed BMV RNA3 and expressed PAP in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a surrogate host for BMV. With an inducible transcription system, we show that the half-life of RNA3 in PAP-expressing cells was significantly less than in cells expressing PAPx, its enzymatically inactive form. PAP bound to RNA3 and depurinated the RNA within open reading frames 3 and 4 and within untranslated regions of the RNA. The depurinated RNA was associated with polysomes, caused ribosomes to stall at the point of depurination, and was targeted for accelerated degradation by components of the No-go decay pathway. As a consequence of translation elongation arrest and increased RNA degradation, expression of PAP in yeast also decreased the level of protein 3a, encoded by the 5′-proximal open reading frame 3 of BMV RNA3. These data provide the first evidence of viral RNA depurination in vivo by any ribosome-inactivating protein and support our hypothesis that depurination contributes to the antiviral activity of PAP, by enhancing viral RNA degradation and reducing translation of viral protein product.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Irvin J.D. Uckun F.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 55: 279-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Like all ribosome-inactivating proteins, PAP is an N-glycosidase that cleaves an adenine from the highly conserved sarcin/ricin loop within domain VI of the large rRNA (3Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Lambert J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 4Hartley M.R. Legname G. Osborn R. Chen Z. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This depurination disrupts the binding ability of elongation factor eEF-2; hence, protein synthesis is inhibited at the translocation step (5Gessner S.L. Irvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3251-3253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to affecting translation, PAP also has broad-range antiviral activity against several animal and plant viruses (6Aron G. Irvin J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 17: 1032-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Zarling J.M. Moran P.A. Haffar O. Sias J. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Myers D.E. Kuebelbeck V.

A. 1993; 90: 7089-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The antiviral property was initially hypothesized to be due to cytotoxic effects caused by reduction in cellular translation. However, subsequent characterization of PAP mutants uncovered variants that maintained antiviral activity without rRNA depurination and consequent inhibition of translation (9Tumer N.E. Hwang D.J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Zoubenko O. Hudak K. Tumer N.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that, in addition to depurination of rRNA, PAP depurinates Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs (11Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 RNA in vitro (12Rajamohan F. Kurinov I.V. Venkatachalam T.K. Uckun F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, pretreatment of BMV RNAs with PAP resulted in decreased synthesis of these viral RNAs in barley protoplasts (13Picard D. Kao C.C. Hudak K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20069-20075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, in addition to depurinating rRNA, PAP may also target viral RNAs in vivo; however, this possibility has not yet been demonstrated.BMV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that possesses a tripartite genome, of which two RNAs are monocistronic (RNAs 1 and 2) and the third RNA is dicistronic (RNA3) (14Kao C.C. Sivakumaran K. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2000; 1: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Noueiry A.O. Ahlquist P. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 77-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The 5′-ends of all three RNAs are capped with 7-methyl-guanylate and the 3′-ends contain a conserved tRNA-like structure without a poly(A) tail (16Ahlquist P. Dasgupta R. Kaesberg P. Cell. 1981; 23: 183-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Felden B. Florentz C. Giege R. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 508-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). RNA1 encodes replication protein 1a, with an N-terminal domain bearing similarity to m7G methyltransferases involved in viral RNA capping, and a C-terminal domain containing a helicase-like motif (18Kong F. Sivakumaran K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1999; 259: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Ahola T. den Boon J.A. Ahlquist P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8803-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). BMV RNA2 encodes replication protein 2a, with domains characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (20Argos P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9909-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). BMV RNA3 contains two open reading frames (ORF) coding for protein 3a, necessary for cell-to-cell movement, and for a coat protein, essential for virion assembly and systemic movement throughout the host (21Miller W.A. Dreher T.W. Hall T.C. Nature. 1985; 313: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 22Allison R. Thompson C. Ahlquist P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This coat protein is translated from subgenomic mRNA4, a viral mRNA that is transcribed during viral infections (14Kao C.C. Sivakumaran K. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2000; 1: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Ahlquist P. Noueiry A.O. Lee W.M. Kushner D.B. Dye B.T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8181-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).Extensive work has demonstrated that BMV replication, subgenomic RNA transcription and translation can occur in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) when cells are transformed with the genes encoding the viral proteins (24Janda M. Ahlquist P. Cell. 1993; 72: 961-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Krol M.A. Olson N.H. Tate J. Johnson J.E. Baker T.S. Ahlquist P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13650-13655Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, yeast has proven to be a valuable and genetically tractable system for studying stages of the BMV “life-cycle” in vivo. In addition, yeast is amenable to observing post-transcriptional processes that affect message stability, as mRNA decay pathways are well characterized. These include the normal turnover of mRNAs (26Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 27Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) plus surveillance pathways that serve to recognize and degrade mRNAs with structural defects (28Culbertson M.R. Neeno-Eckwall E. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Doma M.K. Parker R. Nature. 2006; 440: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 30Isken O. Maquat L.E. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1833-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).PAP has been shown to reduce BMV replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription in barley protoplasts and translation in a cell-free system (11Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Picard D. Kao C.C. Hudak K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20069-20075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate the post-transcriptional effects of PAP on viral RNA and to distinguish these effects from inhibition of virus replication, we employed a non-replicating, inducible transcription system in yeast to track the activity of PAP on RNA3 alone. We show that PAP depurinated the RNA, which resulted in decreased viral protein synthesis and increased viral RNA degradation. Therefore, the antiviral activity of PAP includes these two consequences of RNA depurination in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Transformation into Yeast Strains—cDNAs of PAPwt (wild-type) or PAPx (active-site mutant E176V (31Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) under the control of the GAL1 promoter, were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains W303, also referred to as PSY (MATa ade2–1 trp1–1 ura3–1 leu2–3 112 his3–11 15 can1–100) and RP1674 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ), both used as wild-type strains. Empty vector, lacking a PAP cDNA, was also transformed as a negative control for PAP expression. BMV cDNA3 was amplified from the plasmid pB3TP8 (gift of Dr. C. C. Kao) using forward (5′-GGGGATCCGTAAAATACCAACTAATTCTCG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGGCGGCCGCTGGTCTCTTTTAGAGATTTACAGTG-3′) primers. BMV cDNA3 was cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the uracil-based yeast-expression vector, pCM190, under control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (32Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, KH042, was transformed into yeast already transformed with PAPwt, PAPx, or vector control plasmids, using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method (33Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the decay pathway of depurinated BMV RNA3, the viral cDNA, along with cDNAs of PAPwt or PAPx, were transformed into the deletion strains yRP2054 (xrn1::KanMX4), yRP2071 (ski2::KanMX4) and yRP2077 (upf1::KanMX4). To investigate the involvement of the No-go decay pathway, the same plasmids were transformed into the deletion strains yRP2058 (dom34::KanMX4 ski7::KanMX4), yRP2059 (Met+ lys2Δ hbs1::KanMX4 xrn1::KanMX4), yRP2060 (Met+ lys2Δ dom34::KanMX4 xrn1::KanMX4), and yRP2074 (lys2Δ hbs1::KanMX4 ski2::KanMX4). All deletion strains were in the genetic background of yRP1674 and were provided by Dr. R. Parker. To observe if depurination directly affected RNA3 stability and translatability, a mutant cDNA3 was constructed by a series of overlapping PCRs to mutate the observed depurinated nucleotides in BMV RNA3 from purines to pyrimidines. The mutations, written as nucleotide change and (amino acid change), were as follows: A103C (I to I), A164T (T to S), A177C (K to Q), A371C (M to L), A374T (N to Y), A771T (D to V), A901C (E to A), A1197T (Y to F), A1634C (K to Q), A1672C (R to R), and A1953C (D to A). The resulting mutant cDNA3 was cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pCM190 and transformed, along with cDNAs of PAPwt or PAPx, into yeast strains PSY and RP1674.Protein Expression Analysis—Transformed cells were grown to A600 of 0.4 in SD-leu-ura 2% raffinose with 50 μg/ml tetracycline to suppress BMV cDNA3 transcription. The cells were then pelleted and washed with dH2O before BMV RNA3 transcription was induced in SD-leu-ura 2% raffinose in the absence of tetracycline for 3 h. The cells were then pelleted, washed, and resuspended in SD-leu-ura 2% galactose, to induce transcription of either PAPwt or PAPx for 4 h. Cells were finally pelleted and lysed with glass beads in equal volume to pellet of protein complete buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol). An equal amount of total protein from each sample, as determined by the Bradford Assay, was separated through 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with polyclonal antibodies specific for either PAP (1:5000, provided by Dr. N. E. Tumer), BMV protein 3a (1:1000, provided by Dr. K. Mise), or G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1:5000, Sigma). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence and exposure to x-ray film.Yeast RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (15 μg) was isolated from 10-ml cultures induced to transcribe BMV RNA3 for 3 h prior to transcription activation of PAPwt or PAPx for 4 h. Total RNA was separated in a 7 m urea/4.5% acrylamide gel and transferred to nylon membrane. To detect BMV RNA3, the blot was probed with a nucleotide of ∼200, radiolabeled negative-strand RNA complementary to the 3′-end of BMV RNA3 synthesized from pB3HE1 (13Picard D. Kao C.C. Hudak K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20069-20075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The blot was also probed for G6PD mRNA, using a 5′-end-labeled cDNA primer (5′-TTAGGTACACAGCGGC-3′) and RNAs were visualized by exposure to x-ray film. For time-course analysis of wild-type and mutant RNA3 in wild-type yeast or deletion strains, 100-ml cultures were induced to transcribe BMV RNA3 for 3 h. Cells were then switched to medium containing 50 μg/ml tetracycline (to suppress further RNA3 transcription) and 2% galactose (to induce PAPwt or PAPx transcription). This switch represented the zero time point of a 6-h time course during which 15-ml aliquots were removed for total RNA isolation. Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg) were separated in a 7 m urea/4.5% acrylamide gel and transferred to nylon membrane. To detect BMV RNA3, the blots were probed with a radiolabeled RNA complementary to the 3′-end (as above) or 5′-end of BMV RNA3. The 5′-end of BMV RNA3 was amplified by PCR using forward (5′-GGGGAAGCTTGGCGAACATTCTATTTTACCAACATC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGGGGGAATTCGTTGCGGGGTTCATTAGACTTCAG-3′) primers. The PCR product was cloned between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of KS pBluescript II vector. The cloned plasmid was linearized with HindIII to synthesize negative-strand radiolabeled transcripts complementary to the 5′-end of BMV RNA3. Blots were stripped and probed for 18 S rRNA using a 5′-end-labeled cDNA primer (5′-GGAATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCACC-3′) to indicate RNA loading for each sample.Translation Requirement for BMV RNA3 Degradation—BMV RNA3 transcription was induced as described above in wild-type yeast and deletion strains for 3 h. The cells were then switched to medium containing 2% galactose to induce transcription of either PAPwt or PAPx for 1 h. Following this, BMV RNA3 transcription was inhibited with tetracycline (50 μg/ml), and cellular translation was repressed with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml). This switch represented the zero time point of a 6 h time course during which 15-ml aliquots were removed for total RNA isolation. An equal amount of total RNA (20 μg) was separated in a 7 m urea/4.5% acrylamide gel and transferred to nylon membrane. The blots were probed for BMV RNA3 and 18 S rRNA as described above.RNA Half-life Measurements—Quantification of Northern blots from the time-course analysis was performed using Pharos FX™ Plus Molecular Imager and Quantity One-4.6.1 one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). BMV RNA3 transcript levels at each time point (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h) were normalized with respect to the 18 S rRNA. The half-lives were determined by plotting the percentage of BMV RNA3 remaining at each time point versus the time after transcription repression.RNA Binding and Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cells were grown in 10-ml cultures and induced to transcribe BMV RNA3 and express PAPwt or PAPx as described above. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 4 ml of spheroplast buffer A (1 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm DTT, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2) and spheroplasted with lyticase (200 units) for 30 min at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were then pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and UV-cross-linked at 254 nm for 30 min at 4 °C. Cellular lysate was isolated from spheroplasts in protein complete buffer A as described above. PAP-containing complexes were isolated using polyclonal PAP antibody bound to protein-A-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Following incubation, the beads were washed five times with wash buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100). To elute the PAP-containing complexes from the beads, 100 μl of dH2O was added, and the mixture was boiled for 10 min followed by incubation with proteinase K (100 ng) and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and nucleic acids were precipitated in ethanol. Reverse transcription, using random hexamers, followed by PCR was performed to detect (a) BMV RNA3 (Forward: 5′-CATTCTATTTTACCAACATCG-3′ and Reverse: 5′-CTTTCACAGCCTTTTCAGAG-3′ primers); and (b) G6PD mRNA (Forward: 5′-GCAGCAATGACTTTCAACA-3′ and Reverse: 5′-TTAGGTACACAGCGGC-3′ primers) bound to PAPwt or PAPx. To test for in vitro binding of PAP to BMV RNA3, PAPwt (100 ng) was incubated with BMV RNA3 (500 ng) transcript at 30 °C for 10 min. Samples were then UV-cross-linked, and reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described in this section for in vivo binding.Primer Extension of BMV RNA3—For analysis of depurination, PSY yeast cells were induced to transcribe BMV RNA3 and express PAPwt or PAPx as described above. Total RNA was isolated from the cells, treated with DNase (15 units) for 30 min, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation in ethanol. For primer extension analysis, 2 μg of total yeast RNA was combined with 5 × 105 cpm of 5′-end-labeled BMV cDNA3 probe (ten probes ∼200 nucleotides apart to cover the entire length of BMV RNA3; 2113 nucleotides) and extended with reverse transcriptase (100 units) for 20 min at 48 °C. Products of the reactions were denatured in formamide buffer and separated through a 7 m urea/6% acrylamide gel. To identify the location of BMV RNA3 depurination by PAPwt, deoxynucleotide sequencing of BMV cDNA3 was performed with the same primers used for primer extension analysis. Gels were dried against filter paper and exposed to x-ray film to visualize primer extension patterns and sequencing ladders. The same depurination sites of RNA3 were observed for four independent yeast transformations.Polysome Profiles—Wild-type PSY and deletion mutant (dom34Δxrn1Δ and hbs1Δxrn1Δ) yeast cells were induced to transcribe BMV RNA3 and PAPwt or PAPx as described above. Following induction, cells were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 10 min, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide). Cells were pelleted again, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. The samples were then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was collected and centrifuged twice at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Lysate (14 A260) was loaded on a step gradient of 10 and 35% sucrose prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NH4Cl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 units of RNase inhibitor. To separate polysomes from messenger ribonuclear protein complexes, the gradient was centrifuged at 147,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The polysome pellet was recovered from the bottom of the tube and applied to a 4–47% sucrose gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Fractions (28 of 150 μl) were collected at 4 °C and A260 readings were recorded.To determine if BMV RNA3 was associated with polysomes of PSY, each of two fractions was pooled sequentially, and isolated RNA was analyzed by Northern blot. BMV RNA3 was detected with a probe complementary to the 3′-end of the transcript, as described above for Northern blot analysis. To determine if RNA3 in polysome fractions was depurinated, isolated RNA from monosome and polysome fractions was pooled separately and analyzed by primer extension. Depurination was detected using the 5′-end-labeled BMV cDNA3 probe (5′-TGCTTAACTCTACGAAATGG-3′) complementary for the 3′-end of ORF3.In Vitro Translation and Toe-printing Analysis—Translationally competent PSY extract was prepared using the liquid N2-grinding protocol, column chromatography with Sephadex G-25, and nuclease treatment as described previously (34Sachs M.S. Wang Z. Gaba A. Fang P. Belk J. Ganesan R. Amrani N. Jacobson A. Methods. 2002; 26: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The translation reaction mixture was prepared using 1.5-μl translation reaction components (10 mm ATP, 2.5 mm GTP, 250 mm creatine phosphate), 0.8 unit of creatine phosphokinase, 0.45 μl of 40× common buffer (400 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 40 mm DTT), 1.8 μl of 10× variable buffer (34 mm magnesium acetate, 2.3 m potassium acetate), 0.18 μl of 1 mm amino acids, 3.6 units of RNase inhibitor, and 4 μl of water. For in vitro translation of RNA3, PAPwt or PAPx-treated wild-type or mutant BMV RNA3 (120 ng) (or dH2O for minus RNA3 control) was added to the translation reaction mixture. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of nuclease-treated cell extract and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. Following incubation, the protein product was detected by immunoblot analysis with BMV protein 3a antibody (1:1000). For toe-print analysis, PAPwt- or PAPx-treated wild-type or mutant BMV RNA3 (120 ng) (or dH2O for minus RNA3 control) was added to the translation reaction mixture. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of nuclease-treated cell extract, and samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. As controls for the elongation of ribosomes, cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) was added to some samples prior to addition of yeast extract (t0) or yeast extract was omitted (–EXT). The toe-printing reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 μl of translation reaction to 5.5 μl of annealing solution (1.25 μl of dH2O, 2.0 μl of 5× reaction buffer, 1.0 μl of 0.1 m DTT, 1.0 μl of 2.5 mm dNTPs, 10 units of RNase inhibitor) and incubated at 55 °C for 2 min. The 5′-end-labeled BMV cDNA3 probe (5 × 105 cpm) (5′-CTTTCACAGCCTTTTCAGAG-3′) complementary to the 5′-end of ORF3, was then added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was supplemented with reverse transcriptase (50 units) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Products of the reaction were denatured in formamide buffer and separated in a 7 m urea/6% polyacrylamide gel.RESULTSExpression of PAPwt and PAPx in Yeast—PSY cells were induced to express PAPwt or PAPx (active site mutant of PAP; 31) for 4 h, and expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1). The slower migrating band represents the 33-kDa immature form of the protein, which has been observed previously in yeast and shown to maintain activity (31Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas the faster migrating band represents the 29-kDa mature, processed form. The results indicate similar levels of expression of PAPwt and PAPx in these cells.BMV RNA3 Accumulation in Yeast Cells—Transcription of BMV RNA3 was induced for 3 h, followed by expression of PAPwt or PAPx for 4 h. Northern blot analysis indicated that the level of BMV RNA3 accumulation was ∼3-fold lower in cells expressing PAPwt compared with cells expressing PAPx or cells transformed with empty vector (Fig. 2, A and C). The level of G6PD mRNA was not reduced in the presence of PAPwt and remained essentially constant in all samples (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating some specificity in the reduction of RNA3 levels by PAPwt. Moreover, the enzymatic activity of PAPwt was required for the decrease in viral RNA, as the active-site mutant PAPx did not cause a similar decrease in the level of BMV RNA3.FIGURE 2Accumulation of BMV RNA3 and G6PD mRNA in PSY yeast cells expressing PAPwt or PAPx. A, cells were induced to transcribe BMV RNA3 for 3 h followed by PAP induction for 4 h. Empty vector (VC) was used as a control for no PAP expression. Total yeast RNA (15 μg) was isolated from cells and probed for BMV RNA3 by Northern blot analysis. B, the same samples probed for G6PD mRNA.

Even though PAPx could not depurinate, it retained the ability to bind viral RNA. The viral RNA was not observed in precipitates of vector control cells, indicating PAP-dependent immunoprecipitation of BMV RNA3 (Fig. 3A). In addition, in vitro UV-cross-linking of PAPwt with BMV RNA3, followed by immunoprecipitation, confirmed that PAPwt could bind BMV RNA3 directly in the absence of cellular proteins (Fig. 3A). To verify some specificity of PAP binding to BMV RNA3, similar experiments were performed to determine if PAPwt or PAPx was bound to G6PD mRNA. The results demonstrate that neither protein targeted this message in vivo (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Binding of PAPwt and PAPx to BMV RNA3 and G6PD mRNA. A, for the in vitro sample, PAPwt (100 ng) was incubated with BMV RNA3 transcript (500 ng), followed by UV-cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of PAPwt. For the in vivo samples, transcription of BMV RNA3 was induced in PSY cells for 3 h, followed by PAP induction for 4 h. Cells were transformed with empty vector (VC) as a control for PAP expression. The cells were then spheroplasted and UV-cross-linked, and PAP was immunoprecipitated from the lysate of spheroplasts. Nucleic acids were extracted from the precipitate and used as template for reverse transcription and PCR with specific BMV DNA3 primers. A plasmid encoding BMV DNA3 as PCR template was used as a positive control (+ctrl), and a PCR reaction without template DNA was used as a negative control (–ctrl). B, samples were prepared as described in A, and nucleic acids extracted from the precipitate were used as template for reverse transcription and PCR with specific G6PD primers.

The stimulatory G protein α-subunit (Gsα) couples the β-adrenoreceptor to adenylyl cyclase and the intracellular cAMP response. In a mouse model of conditional Gsα deficiency in the cardiac muscle (Gsα-DF), we demonstrated heart failure phenotypes accompanied by increases in the level of a truncated cardiac troponin I (cTnI-ND) from restricted removal of the cTnI-specific N-terminal extension. To investigate the functional significance of the increase of cTnI-ND in Gsα-DF cardiac muscle, we generated double transgenic mice to overexpress cTnI-ND in Gsα-DF hearts. The overexpression of cTnI-ND in Gsα-DF failing hearts increased relaxation velocity and left ventricular end diastolic volume to produce higher left ventricle maximum pressure and stroke volume. Supporting the hypothesis that up-regulation of cTnI-ND is a compensatory rather than a destructive myocardial response to impaired β-adrenergic signaling, the aberrant expression of β-myosin heavy chain in adult Gsα-DF but not control mouse hearts was reversed by cTnI overexpression. These data indicate that the up-regulation of cTnI-ND may partially compensate for the cardiac inefficiency in impaired β-adrenergic signaling.

In heart failure patients, the level of plasma norepinephrine is enhanced, resulting from activation of sympathetic nervous system, which induces chronic stimulation of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors (9Cohn J.N.

Cardiac TnI is the inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex and plays an essential role in Ca2+ regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. Cardiac TnI is a substrate of PKA and is phosphorylated upon β-adrenergic stimulation (7Kranias E.G. Solaro R.J. Nature. 1982; 298: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The PKA phosphorylation sites are two adjacent serine residues, Ser23/Ser24 (rat/mouse residue numbers), located in the cardiac specific N-terminal extension of cTnI. β-Adrenergic stimulated phosphorylation of cTnI Ser23/Ser24 reduces myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (7Kranias E.G.

A restricted N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal heart and increases in adaptation to hemodynamic changes in the tail suspension rat model of simulated microgravity (24Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing showed that this posttranslational modification preserves the core structure of TnI but selectively removes the cTnI-specific N-terminal extension, including the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23 and Ser24. Transgenic mouse hearts overexpressing the N-terminal truncated cTnI (cTnI-ND) demonstrated increased myocardial relaxation and improved ventricular filling for a better utilization of the Frank-Starling mechanism, mimicking the effect of PKA phosphorylation (25Barbato J.C.

These results suggest that the β-adrenergic signaling pathway affects cTnI function by both phosphorylation and proteolytic modulation to regulate myocardial contraction. In the present study, we showed that impaired β-adrenergic signaling resulting from myocardial Gsα deficiency (Gsα-DF) leads to impaired cardiac function accompanied by an up-regulation of cTnI-ND. Overexpression of cTnI-ND in Gsα-DF hearts increased relaxation velocity and left ventricular end diastolic volume to produce higher left ventricle maximum pressure and stroke volume. Supporting the hypothesis that the up-regulation of cTnI-ND is a compensatory rather than a destructive myocardial response to impaired β-adrenergic signaling, cTnI-ND overexpression reversed the aberrant expression of β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) in Gsα-DF hearts. These data indicate that up-regulation of cTnI-ND may partially compensate for the cardiac inefficiency in impaired β-adrenergic signaling, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure. Production of Gsα-DF in Mouse Cardiac Muscle—Mice with floxed Gsα exon 1 allele (E1fl) (26Chen M. Gavrilova O. Liu J. Xie T. Deng C. Nguyen A.T. Nackers L.M. Lorenzo J. Shen L. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The E1fl allele has no effect on Gsα expression or phenotype (27Chen M. Gavrilova O. Zhao W.Q. Nguyen A. Lorenzo J. Shen L. Nackers L. Pack S. Jou W. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3217-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and therefore both MCK-cre-minus E1fl and E1+/+ littermates were used as controls. Gsα genotyping to distinguish wild type (E1+) and E1fl alleles was performed by PCR using primers flanking the downstream loxP site (27Chen M. Gavrilova O. Zhao W.Q. Nguyen A. Lorenzo J. Shen L. Nackers L. Pack S. Jou W. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3217-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of the MCK-cre transgene was determined by PCR using cre-specific primers (27Chen M. Gavrilova O. Zhao W.Q. Nguyen A. Lorenzo J. Shen L. Nackers L. Pack S. Jou W. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3217-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (6:00 a.m./6:00 p.m.) and standard pellet diet. Mice age 3–5 months of both sexes were used for experiments unless noted in the figure legend. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals, as approved by the Council of the American Physiological Society.

Double transgenic mice were generated by mating cTnI-ND transgenic mice with MGsKO mice for cardiac functional studies. The genotype screening was done by PCR on genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies, and all hearts used for functional studies were confirmed by Western blot for the knockdown of Gsα (27Chen M. Gavrilova O. Zhao W.Q. Nguyen A. Lorenzo J. Shen L. Nackers L. Pack S. Jou W. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin.

SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Gsα protein expression in the cardiac muscle was measured on total tissue protein extracts by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting using a Gsα-specific antibody (27Chen M.

Cardiac TnI and cTnI-ND were examined by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody TnI-1 (28Jin J.-P. Yang F.W. Yu Z.B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and a rabbit antiserum 7428 raised against the N-terminal peptide of cTnI. Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Staining—To detect phosphorylated protein bands in SDS-gel, the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) was applied with a few modifications. Briefly, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prefixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 45 min and transferred to fresh fixer overnight. After washing 3 times in deionized water for 10 min each, the gels were stained for 90 min in a dark container with Pro-Q Diamond stain freshly equilibrated to room temperature by vigorously shaking. After destaining three times in 20% acetonitrile, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, for 30 min each, the gels were washed twice for 5 min each in deionized water and then scanned on a Typhoon 9410 fluorescence imager (GE Healthcare) using fluorescence mode (600 V, high sensitivity, green laser 532 nm for excitation and 560 nm long pass for emission). Identification and Quantification of MHC Isoforms—Cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms were separated by glycerol-SDS-PAGE and quantified as previously described (29Yu Z.B. Gao F. Feng H.-Z. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C1192-C1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total protein was extracted from cardiac muscle by direct homogenization in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Myosin heavy chain isoforms were resolved using 8% polyacrylamide gel with a 50:1 ratio of acrylamide/bisacrylamide containing 30% glycerol prepared in 200 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm glycine (pH 8.8), and 0.4% SDS. The upper running buffer was composed of 100 mm Tris base, 150 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS containing 10 mm β-ME. The lower running buffer was 50 mm Tris base, 75 mm glycine, and 0.05% SDS. After running at 100 V in an icebox for 24 h, resolved protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R250. Isolated Working Mouse Heart Preparation and Functional Measurements—Cardiac function of transgenic and wild type mice was measured in isolated working heart preparations (25Barbato J.C. Huang Q.Q.

Thirty minutes after intraperitoneal injection of 100 units of heparin, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally), and the heart was rapidly isolated. A modified 18-gauge needle 6 mm long with a thinned wall to reduce the outside diameter was used as the aortic cannula. A pin with a pointed end was placed inside of the needle as a guide to facilitate the cannulation. After establishing retrograde perfusion, a modified 16-gauge needle was used to cannulate the pulmonary vein for antegrade perfusion through the left atrium. A beveled PE-50 tubing was used to cannulate the pulmonary artery to collect coronary flow. After all cannulations were established, the heart was switched to working mode by opening the left atrial perfusion. In all experiments, the hearts were perfused with Krebs-Hensileit buffer aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C without recycling to exclude the effects of metabolic chemicals and hormones. The buffer contents were modified as follows: 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.25 mm CaCl2, 2.25 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.32 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm d-glucose, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4, adjusted at 37 °C. The high concentration of d-glucose (32Gauthier N.S. Matherne G.P. Morrison R.R. Headrick J.P. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and sodium pyruvate effectively prevents contractile cycling (cyclic fluctuations) (33Wang Q.D. Tokuno S. Valen G. Sjoquist P.O. Thoren P. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2002; 175: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) caused by insufficient metabolic substrates for ex vivo working mouse heart (34Sutherland F.J. Baker K.E. Shattock M.J. Hearse D.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2003; 30: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), allowing the hearts to be functionally stable in working mode for over 2 h. A 30-gauge needle was used to puncture the left ventricle wall from the apex to make a path for the insertion of a 1.2 French pressure-volume (P-V) catheter (model 898B; Scisense, London, Ontario, Canada; calibrated for pressure and volume at 37 °C). Aortic pressure was measured using an MLT844 pressure transducer (Capto, Horten, Norway). An air bubble was placed in the compliance chamber to mimic in vivo arterial compliance. The size of the bubble affects the aortic pressure trace and the shape of the left ventricular P-V loop. Based on conditions established by previous studies, we kept the bubble size at 0.5 ml in all experiments for isolated working mouse heart, which resembled P-V loops similar to that recorded in vivo (35How O.J. Aasum E. Kunnathu S. Severson D.L. Myhre E.S. Larsen T.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H2979-H2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Heart rate was controlled at 480 or 420 beats/min by supraventricular pacing using an isolated stimulator (A365; World Precision Instruments) with two microplatinum electrodes touching on the right atrium. Cardiac outputs were measured by the actual aortic and pulmonary artery flows recorded in real time by calibrated drop counting using a pair of copper electrodes (one was attached to an iron clip to produce a different potential from the other) feeding to computer software (Chart 5; AD Instruments) via a Powerlab/16 SP digital data archiving system (AD Instruments). Base-line function of the isolated working hearts was measured for the intraventricular pressure, the maximum rate of left ventricular pressure development (±dP/dt max), and left ventricular volume measurements. Stroke volume (μl/mg heart tissue) was calculated from the sum of aortic flow and coronary effluent, normalized to heart rate. Cardiac Function at Various Pressure Loads—During stabilization of the mouse working heart preparations and the measurement of base-line functions, the preload pressure was 10 mm Hg, and the afterload was at 55 mm Hg (25Barbato J.C. Huang Q.Q. Hossain M.M. Bond M. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Huang Q.-Q. Feng H.-Z. Liu J. Du J. Stull L.B.

(Lond.). 2008; 586: 3537-3550Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of Gsα-DF on cardiac function against pressure load ventricular performance was measured while increasing the afterload from 55 to 90 mm Hg. Data Analysis—Densitometry analysis of SDS-gel and Western immunoblot was performed on images scanned at 600 dots/inch using NIH Image 1.61 software. All cardiac functional analyses were performed in a blinded setting. Quantitative data were documented as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between the mean values was analyzed by two-tail unpaired Student's t test unless noted in the table or figure legends. Gsα Deficiency in Cardiac Muscle Results in Heart Failure Phenotypes with Diminished β-Adrenergic Response—Immunoblots of ventricular muscle homogenates demonstrated that the level of Gsα protein was significantly diminished in the MCK-cre,E1fl/fl (MGsKO) mouse hearts as compared with that in wild type controls (Fig. 1A). The weak residual level of Gsα detected by immunoblot in the total heart tissue samples may be from noncardiac muscle tissues, such as the vasculature, nerves, and fibroblasts. Cardiac TnI and myosin-binding protein C are two major substrates of PKA downstream of the Gsα signaling pathway. Phosphoprotein staining showed decreased phosphorylation level of the two proteins in vivo in Gsα-DF hearts, whereas the non-PKA-based phosphorylation of cardiac troponin T had no apparent change (Fig. 1B). Although ex vivo perfusion of isolated working hearts significantly reduced the phosphorylation of cTnI and myosin-binding protein C, reflecting the removal of sympathetic nervous tone, isoproterenol treatment increased their phosphorylation levels in wild type hearts but had no effect on that in Gsα-DF hearts (Fig. 1C). Altogether, the diminished PKA phosphorylation confirmed that myocardial β-adrenergic signaling was impaired in this model. Function of the Gsα-DF hearts was examined ex vivo in isolated working heart preparations. The heart rate was controlled in the physiological range from 420 to 480 beats/min by supraventricular pacing. Summarized in Table 1, the Gsα-DF hearts showed hypertrophy (increased heart/body weight ratio) without significant dilation, since there was no change in the left ventricular end diastolic volume. Cardiac function analysis at 10 mm Hg preload and 55 mm Hg afterload demonstrated, among multiple parameters measured, decreased contractile and relaxation velocities (±dP/dt), left ventricle maximum pressure, time to 50% peak pressure, mean aortic pressure (diastolic pressure + ⅓ pulse pressure; Fig. 2A), stroke volume, and ejection fraction, clearly indicating decreased cardiac function.TABLE 1Base-line function of ex vivo working hearts Functional studies were performed ex vivo in working heart preparations at 10 mm Hg preload and 55 mm Hg afterload.

After raising the afterload hydrostatic column, wild type mouse hearts were able to reach 90 mm Hg afterload and produce aortic output. In contrast, not all Gsα-DF hearts were able to reach 90 mm Hg afterload. Functional analysis of eight wild type and five Gsα-DF hearts that were able to overcome 90 mm Hg afterload further showed that Gsα deficiency resulted in more clear decrease in cardiac function at the increased afterload (the parameters measured are shown in Table 2), consistent with a decreased myocardial potential. Representative P-V loops during the increase in afterload are shown in Fig. 2B. End systolic pressure volume relationship for the slope of changing end systolic pressure volume values quantitatively demonstrated the significantly lower myocardial contractility of Gsα-DF hearts (Fig. 2C). Pressure recruitment of stroke work derived from P-V loop measurement also showed decreased stroke work in Gsα-DF hearts during the increase in afterload (Fig. 2D).TABLE 2Isolated working heart function at increased afterload In comparison with the base-line function measured at 55 mm Hg afterload (Table 1), cardiac function in response to pressure load was examined by increasing the afterload to 90 mm Hg. Although all wild type hearts were able to reach 90 mm Hg afterload to produce aortic output, only five of seven Gsα-DF hearts tested were able to overcome 90 mm Hg afterload with significantly decreased function.

The intrinsic heart rate of Gsα-DF hearts was responsive to the perfusion of 10 nm isoproterenol, similar to that of wild type hearts, indicating unaffected β-adrenergic signaling in the pacemaker cells (Fig. 3A). Isoproterenol produced significantly positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in wild type working hearts with increased contractile velocity (+dP/dt), relaxation velocity (-dP/dt), left ventricular maximal pressure, stroke volume, and ejection fraction and reduced left ventricular minimal pressure. In contrast, isoproterenol had no effects or opposite effects on those functional parameters in the Gsα-DF hearts (Fig. 3, B–F). Gsα-DF Mouse Hearts Show an Increased Production of cTnI-ND—An interesting change in the myofilament proteins of Gsα-DF hearts was an increase of a cTnI fragment (Fig. 4A). Using monoclonal antibody TnI-1 against the C terminus of TnI and an anti-cardiac TnI N-terminal peptide rabbit polyclonal antibody 7428, immunoblots showed that this cTnI fragment lacked the N-terminal segment, whereas it retained an intact C terminus (Fig. 4B), indicating that the cTnI fragment was produced by restricted N-terminal truncation, similar to the cTnI fragment produced in rat hearts during hemodynamic adaptation to simulated microgravity (24Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Quantification of the immunoblots showed that impaired β-adrenergic signaling increased the level of cTnI from 11.6 to 27.5% of total cTnI"

Because the NMDA receptor is known to regulate gene expression, it is important to examine whether networks of kinases control signaling to gene expression. We examined the requirement of multiple kinases and NMDA receptor-interacting proteins for gene expression in mouse hippocampal slices. Protocols that induce long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) activated common kinases and overlapping gene expression profiles. Combinations of kinases were required for induction of each gene. Distinct combinations of kinases were required to up-regulate Arc, Npas4, Egr2, and Egr4 following either LTP or LTD protocols. Consistent with the combinatorial data, a mouse mutant model of the human cognition disease gene SAP102, which couples ERK kinase to the NMDA receptor, showed deregulated expression of specific genes.

Molecular networks are now recognized as a basis for integration of signaling within cells. The potential for highly complex phosphorylation networks is suggested by phosphoproteomic studies that show thousands of phosphorylation sites in many cells (1Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B.

Although the role of tyrosine, serine, and threonine kinases in synaptic plasticity, learning, and other forms of behavioral plasticity is well described (7Greengard P. Science. 2001; 294: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 8Kandel E.R. Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar), little is known about their organization into networks and the properties of these networks. The process of learning involves the conversion of information within patterns of neuronal electrical activity into biochemical changes within neurons. These biochemical changes are initiated at the synaptic level, where signal transduction pathways modulate local synaptic strength as well as signals to the nucleus to drive gene expression. In recent years it has become clear that learning is not a simple switch but a set of signaling events and cell biological processes that show diversity and complexity. For example, at the electrophysiological level, different patterns of activity either induce long-term depression (LTD) 3The abbreviations used are: LTD, long-term depression; LTP, long-term potentiation; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; PI3K, phoshoinositide-3-kinase; TF, transcription factors; IEG, immediate early genes; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 3The abbreviations used are: LTD, long-term depression; LTP, long-term potentiation; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; PI3K, phoshoinositide-3-kinase; TF, transcription factors; IEG, immediate early genes; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. or long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission by activating the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The potential exists for networks of kinases to regulate the gene expression associated with LTP and LTD. A kinase network model would be an attractive mechanism for orchestrating the differential expression of genes and would be expected to be revealed by addressing the following questions: First, to what extent do multiple kinases regulate any given gene? Second, do stimulation paradigms that initiate LTP and LTD regulate common sets of genes? Third, are genes that are both regulated by LTP and LTD share the same dependence on specific kinases? Fourth, do mutations in NMDA receptor complex (NRC) proteins (such as SAP102/dlg3) interfere with gene expression? To address these issues, we have studied NMDA receptor-activated gene expression in hippocampal slices from mice. The NMDA receptor was activated using chemical stimulation protocols that result in LTP or LTD. Using microarray profiling we identify a common set of genes induced by the LTP and LTD protocols. Inhibition of specific kinases shows that NMDA receptor activation of each gene is regulated by multiple kinases and that the set of kinases that regulates a gene may differ in LTP and LTD protocols. We also document that a mutation in NMDA receptor-associated proteins (SAP102/dlg3) impairs ERK kinase signaling and ERK-dependent gene expression. These data suggest a model where the synaptic kinase signaling networks coordinate gene expression through their differential activation during LTP and LTD. Preparation of Hippocampal Slices—Experiments were performed on hippocampal slices obtained from 12–14-week old 129S5/SvEvBrd mice bred at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute essentially and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation in accordance with Schedule 1 to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Hippocampal slices were prepared as described (30Kopanitsa M.V. Afinowi N.O. Grant S.G. BMC Neurosci. 2006; 7: 61Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Before the start of biochemical stimulations, slices rested under these conditions for at least 2 h after the last slice was cut. Biochemical Stimulation—Experiments were usually performed on slices from four animals, simultaneously. We used two separate chambers for treated and untreated (solvent only) slices. One chamber had two wells, which were further divided into two halves by a thin silicone barrier to accommodate slices from four separate mice without mixing them up. In this way, 10–12 slices obtained from one mouse were evenly divided between two respective compartments in “treated” and “untreated” chambers yielding 5–6 slices per experimental condition. To stimulate biochemical pathways, we incubated slices in the “treated” chamber with one of the three drug-containing solutions: 1) 20 ;m NMDA (3 min); 2) 50 ;m forskolin + 100 nm rolipram in Mg2+-free ACSF (15 min). To facilitate solution exchange in the slice chamber well, the speed of solution flow was increased to 5–7 ml/min for 3 min during the start of incubation with drugs and upon their wash-out. In experiments using NMDA receptor or protein kinase inhibitors, perfusion of each inhibitor was used for 30 min prior to application of the stimulation drug solutions and also throughout drug stimulation and wash-out periods. Routinely, inhibitors were applied to one of the two wells of the “treated” chamber that contained slices from 2 animals. Slices from another pair of animals were stimulated with a drug solution that contained a concentration of DMSO equal to the one used to dissolve inhibitors in the other group. Slices in an untreated chamber also received the same solvent treatment, if necessary. Slices were incubated in the “treated” chamber with the following solutions: Wortmannin 200 nm (40 min), KN-62 10 ;m (30 min), APV 50 ;m (10 min), SB203580 10 ;m (40 min), U0126 20 ;m (40 min). All drugs were from Tocris Cooksoon Ltd (Bristol, UK). Standard techniques were used for Western blot analysis of the samples. For primary antibody information, see supplemental Table S3. Nucleic Acid Isolation and Microarray Hybridization—Hippocampal slices were immediately frozen in dry ice or immersed into RNAlater reagent (Qiagen) on ice for RNA isolation. RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen) were used to purify total RNA. On-column DNase treatment was carried out to remove traces of DNA. During all the purifications, the manufacturer's instructions were followed. Samples were concentrated with the addition of 1:10 volumes of 3 m NaOAc, pH 6 and 3 vol of 100% EtOH and precipitated at -20 °C. Once resuspended in 12 ;l of RNase-free H2O, an aliquot was used to check the RNA integrity in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. For the transcriptome profiling, MG-430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) were used that contain 45,101 probe sets including controls, one array per sample. Four samples were analyzed, divided in two (stimulated and non-stimulated) for a total of eight hybridizations. Briefly, 1 ;g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized using One Cycle Labeling kit instructions (Affymetrix). Fluidics Station 450 and GCS3000, both from Affymetrix, were used for the washing and scanning steps, respectively. Microarray Statistical Analyses—Three procedures were used to obtain the changing genes after stimulation: (i) pairwise comparisons, (ii) GeneSpring analysis for comparison of multiple samples, and (iii) pairwise comparisons using a data extraction tool alternative to GCOS. Because of the high variability found in the response to stimulation, a balance was found by trial and error between permissibility and stringency in the results. To this aim, samples were analyzed in pairwise comparisons (stimulated versus non-stimulated slices from the same animal) to minimize the effect of different levels of transcript at the basal state. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed a higher similarity between samples according to the animal processed rather than the treatment (data not shown). For the pairwise comparisons, two different tools were used that extracted the signal intensity values using different algorithms: Batch analysis (GCOS) and dChip analysis (31Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). In the Batch analysis, signal intensity values and detection flags were extracted using GCOS, using a Target value of 500 in the scaling step. Next, a Batch analysis (included in the GCOS package) was performed for each pair of samples. All the samples were found to be “Present” and no further filtering was required. In the dChip analysis, signal intensity values were extracted and analyzed using the PM-only model, considering each pair of samples (stimulated and non-stimulated) separately. In both analyses, we considered the probe sets that were retrieved in at least 3 of 4 comparisons in the same direction of change, with a fold change >1.2 (because of the low number of changing genes retrieved in NMDA experiments). These results were also compared with the results of a multiple comparison (all stimulated versus all non-stimulated samples) to study how many significant probe sets were sufficiently robust to overcome individual variability. GeneSpring v7 (Silicon Genetics) was used for the multiple comparison after the GCOS extraction procedure. First, the data were normalized by the median per gene and per array. Next, the resulting data were filtered using the following criteria: (i) analysis of variance test (p < 0.05) without assuming equal variances, (ii) signal intensity must be a Present or Marginal call in all untreated samples when down-regulated and treated samples when up-regulated, and (iii) applying the same fold change threshold as above. The final lists of positive probe sets consisted of those appearing in 2 of 3 types of analyses. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—For the retrotranscription, 1 ;g of total RNA was used for the retrotranscription, following the recommendations of Invitrogen (SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase). PCR reactions were set up per sample using 0.4 ;l of cDNA, 0.3 ;m each primer, 10 ;l of 2× SYBR Green PCR mix (either Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, Qiagen, or Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems) to a final volume of 20 ;l. The sequences of the primers are reported in supplemental Table S4. Reactions were run out in the 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 15 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 50 s (when using Qiagen SYBR Green mix), 1 cycle of 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min (when using SYBR Green mix). The resulting amplicons were checked for specificity and size in agarose gels. The data generated were analyzed in 7500 System SDS v1.2.2 software that calculated the cycle threshold (CT) and the fold change (2-ΔΔCT). GAPDH was used as endogenous control. Results were retrieved from at least two different days of stimulation (eight animals, four treated with the agonist and four treated with the agonist plus the signaling pathway inhibitor). After GAPDH normalization, fold changes were compared between pairs of stimulated/non-stimulated slices from the same animal. To calculate the effect of the inhibitors, % of change was calculated related to full stimulation (without inhibitor). However, those cases where the fold change was negative or very mild (i.e. <1.3) were considered as non-induced, and the % of the basal (1Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M. Cell. 2006; 127: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar) was calculated. To analyze the significance of the changes observed in individual genes, Student's t test was used. To cluster the qRT-PCR results for the tested genes (FSK treatment, see Fig. 4 and text), smooth correlations of the % changes were used to build a hierarchical tree (GeneSpring). NMDA Receptor Activation of Multiple Kinases and Genes—Hippocampal slices were treated with bath application of the glutamate receptor agonist NMDA (20 ;m), which is known to induce long-term depression (Chem-LTD) (9Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 10Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2862) Google Scholar). To characterize a set of kinases regulated by this protocol, proteins were extracted at different time points (3′, 20′, and 40′) and immunoblotted with phosphospecific antibodies and quantified (Fig. 1, A and B). We chose to study 7 kinases from 4 different groups; (i) AGC kinases, Akt, (ii) CMGC kinases, Erk2, p38, JNK1, (iii) STE kinases PAK1/3, MEK1/2, and (iv) PTK kinases, Src. Consistent with previous studies, all kinases were modulated by NMDA stimulation: the 6 serine/threonine kinases showed robust increased phosphorylation with a peak at 3 min, and Src tyrosine kinase showed a decrease in phosphorylation. All the changes in phosphorylation returned to basal levels after 40-min post-stimulation. To identify a candidate set of immediate early genes (IEGs) that might be dependent on these kinases, we isolated total RNA from slices at 60 min after NMDA receptor stimulation and performed microarray profiling. The profiling time of 60 min was selected after performing quantitative RT-PCR assays of well known IEGs at different time points (data not shown). As shown in supplemental Table S1, we identified 16 genes that were activated by NMDA using MG-430 2.0 arrays and qRT-PCR assays. To map the requirement of specific kinases in the induction of gene expression, we pretreated the hippocampal slices with different kinase inhibitors or the NMDA antagonist APV prior to NMDA stimulation and then measured the amount of gene induction. We focused on 4 specific kinase antagonists that interfere with signaling pathways downstream of the NMDA receptor (Fig. 1, A and B): MAPK pathways; MEK/ERK (inhibited by UO126) and p38 (inhibited by SB203580); Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase pathway (inhibited by KN-62) and phoshoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway (inhibited by wortmannin). As expected, these inhibitors were effective in reducing or preventing the phosphorylation of their respective kinase substrates (supplemental Fig. S1). We selected 4 NMDA-regulated genes (Arc, Egr2, Egr4, and Npas4) as reporters and monitored their expression using qRT-PCR and, as expected, APV prevented the activation of all 4 genes (Fig. 1C). We next addressed the role of individual kinases in the activation in the Chem-LTD protocol. We observed that each gene was regulated by multiple kinase inhibitors with differential effects (Fig. 1C). This indicates that each of the NMDA-dependent kinases tested contributed to gene expression. However, no single kinase could account for the modulation of the total set of genes. For example Arc, Egr2, and Egr4 were inhibited by MEK and p38 inhibitors but only Egr2 was insensitive to PI3K inhibition. In contrast to these three genes, Npas4 was insensitive to MEK and p38 inhibitors and only required PI3K pathway for activation. Fig. 1C summarizes the differential kinase requirements of the 4 genes in NMDA receptor activation and illustrates the network of kinase-gene interactions. The fact that multiple genes were regulated by multiple kinases suggests that integration of synaptic kinase pathways provide subtlety and graded responses to the output of synaptic signaling in the gene expression programming. In this model, shifting the activity of a kinase might alter the output and relative levels of gene expression. To address this issue, we selected a different protocol, known to induce LTP (Chem-LTP) (11Otmakhov N. Khibnik L. Otmakhova N. Carpenter S. Riahi S. Asrican B. Lisman J. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This protocol combines activation of NMDAR and PKA with a combination of forskolin (PKA activator), rolipram (phosphodiesterase inhibitor that enhances cAMP levels), and low Mg2+ (facilitates NMDA receptor activation). Similar to the experiments with the Chem-LTD protocol we next examined the activation of the same set of kinases using phosphorylation assays using the Chem-LTP protocol (Fig. 2A). The same set of kinases was activated, although higher and more persistent levels of kinase phosphorylation were observed (lasting at least 40-min poststimulation). Next, we examined the requirement for NMDA receptor using the reporter genes and found a partial blockade of Arc, Egr2, and Egr4, and the most effective blockade in Npas4 (Figs. 1C and 2C). Differential kinase requirements were observed in each gene, and importantly, a different pattern to that seen with Chem-LTD. For example, Arc, Egr4, and Npas4 were sensitive to PI3K inhibition in the Chem-LTD protocol but insensitive in the Chem-LTP protocol. Despite this shift in the PI3K sensitivity of these 3 genes between the LTP and LTD protocols, their sensitivity to MEK and p38 was maintained. The comparison of both protocols indicates that kinases that are not required for the expression of particular genes in particular protocols become essential under other conditions. This switching of kinase dependence was further illustrated in the NMDAR-dependent activation of Npas4: PI3K was required to obtain a 100% induction of Npas4 in the Chem-LTD protocol; however, in the Chem-LTP protocol the PI3K pathway was no longer required; and Npas4 expression was largely contributed to by a MEK-dependent pathway. As summarized in Fig. 3A, these differential kinase requirements and differential gene expression profiles indicate that considerable plasticity in gene expression profiles can be achieved by differentially recruiting a combination of kinases.FIGURE 3A, model of the signaling pathways that were activated by Chem-LTD and B Chem-LTP that influenced gene expression, based upon the data in Fig. 1C and Fig. 2C. Solid arrow indicates a strong and significant effect (>2-fold, p < 0.05). Dashed arrow indicates either a slight but significant effect (<2-fold, p < 0.05, Student's t test) or large but not significant effect of the inhibitor (>2-fold, p > 0.05, Student's t test). B, differences in the signaling pathways for gene induction were not due to differences in the magnitude of change because only Egr2 was significantly different in both treatments (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the above studies show, two distinct protocols associated with two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity result in the induction of the same 4 genes, and moreover, the magnitude of gene induction by each protocol (Chem-LTD, Chem-LTP) was not significantly different for Npas4 (5.34 ± 0.89 versus 5.0 ± 0.40, p = 0.36), Arc (2.70 ± 0.23 versus 3.53 ± 0.45, p = 0.06), or Egr4 (3.09 ± 0.31 versus 4.23 ± 0.65, p = 0.06). Only Egr2 presented a significant higher fold induction with the Chem-LTP protocol: 2.92 + 0.30 in NMDA versus 4.87 ± 0.41, p = 0.0002). This suggests that these genes are important for the biological outcome (perhaps memory storage) associated with both LTP and LTD, and that the signaling networks are arranged so as to activate these genes using different kinases recruited under the different LTP and LTD paradigms. This raises the question: does LTP and LTD drive the same set of genes or are there other sets that are activated in either protocol? To investigate this, we used microarrays profiling for the Chem-LTP protocol and compared the overlapping and distinct genes in a Venn diagram (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S1). Twelve genes were found to be common to both chemical protocols, representing 75% of the Chem-LTD genes and 16% of Chem-LTP. These data show that there is a significant overlap in the two gene sets induced by these protocols, as well as distinct differences. To further characterize the combinatorial action of kinases on sets of genes described above, we extended these studies to a larger set of genes in the Chem-LTP protocol. We selected 17 representing ∼27% of the total and 4 were in the overlapping Chem-LTD set (Fig. 4B). Changes in expression levels were quantitated by qRT-PCR, and the resulting patterns of inhibitor sensitivity (% of inhibition related to full gene stimulation) were correlated using a hierarchical clustering method (see “Experimental Procedures”). For each gene, the signaling pathway profile or induction code was represented in a row and the inhibitor profile for many genes is shown as a column (Fig. 4B). Several points became clear: first, a wide range of unique profiles were observed, each gene had a unique profile. Second, the patterns were non-random and general patterns were observed, with genes grouped into two principal sets. Third, inhibitors with similar profiles were clustered in adjacent positions in the following order: MEK, p38, NMDA receptor, CamK, PI3K. The MAPK pathways (MEK and p38) generated more closely related profiles (i.e. inhibiting a similar subset of genes) and thereby reflecting the cooperativity between both MAPK pathways. As shown in Fig. 4B, we indicate those genes that are regulated by Chem-LTP and Chem-LTD highlighting the overlapping and distinct sets of genes induced. Together these data show that the combinations of kinases regulate many genes, and differential recruitment of kinases can read out distinct profiles comprised of overlapping and unique genes. Altered Gene Expression in SAP102/dlg Mutant Mice— The NMDA receptor-dependent activation of synaptic plasticity and behavior has been shown to require the function of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK) family proteins. Three vertebrate MAGUK paralogues (SAP102, PSD-95, PSD-93) bind directly to the C terminus of NMDA 2 subunits (NR2) (12Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Knockouts in SAP102 (13Cuthbert P.C. Stanford L.E. Coba M.P. Ainge J.A. Fink A.E. Opazo P. Delgado J.Y. Komiyama N.H.

J., Fink, A. E., Grant, S. G. N., and O' Dell, T. J. (2008) J. Physiol. 586, in press. result in altered synaptic plasticity. Our previous characterization of SAP102 knock-out mice (13Cuthbert P.C. Stanford L.E. Coba M.P. Ainge J.A. Fink A.E. Opazo P. Delgado J.Y. Komiyama N.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), showed that this mutation caused a specific impairment of the NMDAR-dependent Erk2 activation. We therefore tested if the reduced activation of Erk2 by NMDAR in SAP102 mutant mice affected the expression of genes associated with Erk2 modulation in hippocampal slices. Consistent with the predictions presented above, the induction of Arc and Egr2 was significantly reduced compared with wild-type animals in 38 ± 2% (p = 0.003, Student's t test) and 27 ± 6% (p = 0.023, Student's t test), respectively. Moreover, consistent with SAP102 not being involved in the modulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway the NMDAR-dependent induction of Npas4 was not affected (p = 0.136, Student's t test). These data indicate that specific mutations in NMDA receptor-associated proteins can uncouple the ERK-dependent pathway to ERK-dependent gene expression. We examined signaling from NMDA receptor to gene expression focusing on the differential roles played by multiple kinases in regulating downstream genes. We asked whether multiple kinases regulate a given gene and whether stimulation paradigms that initiate LTP and LTD regulate common and distinct sets of genes. We observed that multiple kinases contributed to the transcriptional activation of a given gene and using LTP or LTD induction paradigms found these protocols shifted the relative contribution made by a kinase in the induction of a target gene. A common set of genes was regulated by the LTP and LTD protocols as well as subsets specific to each protocol. We also addressed the role of NMDA receptor-associated proteins coupling to gene expression and found that specific kinases and genes could be functionally uncoupled from NMDA receptor signaling by mutations of SAP102. Our data are consistent with postsynaptic kinase networks with the following features: (i) a stimulus activates multiple kinases, and different stimuli trigger different sets of kinases, (ii) each kinase phosphorylates multiple types of postsynaptic proteins including receptors, adaptors, enzymes, structural proteins, trafficking, and translational regulators, (iii) each kinase regulates multiple transcription factors (TF), and (iv) each TF regulates multiple genes. Together these steps allow differential receptor activation or multiple receptors, to drive overlapping sets of genes. An interesting characteristic of the recruitment of a combination of kinases that regulate a set of genes, is that the same gene could be induced by two different protocols (e.g. Chem-LTD and Chem-LTP) yet have completely different kinase dependencies. The most dramatic effect was observed in the activation of Npas4: Npas4 only required the modulation of the PI3K pathway to induce its expression with Chem-LTD, while with Chem-LTP the MEK/ERK pathway was essential for the expression of Npas4, with no requirement for the PI3K cascade. Interestingly, this lack of a requirement for PI3K in Chem-LTP induction of Npas4 occurs even though PI3K was activated (Fig. 3A). In other words, PI3K was being activated but not used for gene expression. Thus, there is a switching between the utilization of different kinases depending on upstream activation protocols. Switching in the dependence of ERK and PI3K has been reported for the induction of LTP: high-frequency (100 Hz)-induced LTP is not blocked by MEK inhibitors but is inhibited by PI3K inhibitors. Importantly, this contrasts to theta-pulse (5Hz) induced LTP that required both MEK and PI3K (16Opazo P. Watabe A.M. Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3679-3688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover the dependence on MEK in TPS-LTP was abolished in mice carrying a mutation in the NMDA receptor-interacting protein PSD-95 (16Opazo P. Watabe A.M. Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3679-3688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the details of the switching mechanisms may require the mapping of phosphorylation sites on substrates and their interactions. How the combinatorial activation of signaling pathways is translated into patterns of gene expression is likely explained by the phosphorylation of TFs and their protein interactors. Recently an integrative model of transcription factors, activated by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R), described a signaling network connecting CB1R to 23 activated transcription factors. In this model, the use of pharmacological inhibitors for different protein kinases revealed a kinase-transcription factor network organization of CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth (17Bromberg K.D. Ma'ayan A. Neves S.R. Iyengar R. Science. 2008; 320: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There are several well known TFs including CREB and other members of the family, the ternary complex Elk-1/SRF, Egr members, MEF2, AP-1, and NF-kB that have a demonstrated role in synaptic plasticity processes (18Deisseroth K. Mermelstein P.G. Xia H. Tsien R.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Winstanley C.A. LaPlant Q. Theobald D.E. Green T.A. Bachtell R.K.

Focusing on the NMDA receptor-activated genes Arc, Egr2, Egr4, and Npas induction, it is reported that Arc expression can be activated by CREB or Egr and Egr2 activated by CREB and SRF (22Han J.H. Kushner S.A. Yiu A.P. Cole C.J. Matynia A. Brown R.A. Neve R.L. Guzowski J.F. Silva A.J. Josselyn S.A. Science. 2007; 316: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 23Li L. Carter J. Gao X.

We examined the computationally predicted TF binding sites in the 5′-region (1-kb upstream and 200-bp downstream of the transcription start site) of Arc, Egr2, Egr4, and Npas4 and found they share similar TF sites for NF-;B, SRF, and CREB among others) albeit in different locations and combinations (supplemental Fig. S2). The differences in the promoter architecture may account for differential strength (or affinity) of the TF, the recruitment of other TFs and the direct binding of specific TFs. Therefore, differential phosphorylation of these TFs and their interacting proteins may explain induction of either different genes or common genes under different stimulation protocols. A similar model of cooperation of multiple signaling pathways in regulating gene expression has been reported for CD40 receptor activation in B lymphocytes (28Dadgostar H. Zarnegar B. Hoffmann A. Qin X.F. Truong U. Rao G. Baltimore D. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Following receptor activation and gene expression profiling in the presence of specific kinase inhibitors (including those used in the present study), it was reported that overlapping and distinct sets of genes were regulated by PI3K, p38, and NF-;B pathways. Three mechanisms were proposed to account for the regulation by multiple signaling pathways downstream of single receptor of gene expression: independent, collective, and redundant control. The independent control refers to situations where each pathway regulates a distinct set of genes; the collective control is when a set of pathways regulate a single or common large set of genes that constitute the entire expression profile; in redundant control, different pathways can substitute for one another. Both independent and collective regulation was observed in the response of B cells to CD40 activation. These studies on the organization of postsynaptic signaling networks and the postsynaptic proteome are revealing a signaling system with features of complexity, combinatorial functions, and redundancy. In addition to their basic roles in information processing (both electrophysiological and biochemical) studies on mice carrying mutations in these proteins reveal changes in cognitive function. Many of these proteins have also been implicated in the etiology of multiple brain diseases (29Grant S.G. Marshall M.C. Page K.L. Cumiskey M.A. Armstrong J.D. Hum Mol Genet. 2005; 14: R225-R234Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and it is likely that some aspects of the phenotype of these diseases results from changes in the signaling networks. Understanding the organization of the networks may help identify drug targets for modulating the disease processes. We thank V. J. Robinson for mouse colony maintenance, D. G. Fricker, E. C.

https://openalex.org/W2007424618,"Background PKCθ is a novel protein kinase C isozyme, predominately expressed in T cells and platelets. PKCθ−/− T cells exhibit reduced activation and PKCθ−/− mice are resistant to autoimmune disease, making PKCθ an attractive therapeutic target for immune modulation. Collagen is a major agonist for platelets, operating through an immunoreceptor-like signalling pathway from its receptor GPVI. Although it has recently been shown that PKCθ positively regulates outside-in signalling through integrin αIIbβ3 in platelets, the role of PKCθ in GPVI-dependent signalling and functional activation of platelets has not been assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we assessed static adhesion, cell spreading, granule secretion, integrin αIIbβ3 activation and platelet aggregation in washed mouse platelets lacking PKCθ. Thrombus formation on a collagen-coated surface was assessed in vitro under flow. PKCθ−/− platelets exhibited reduced static adhesion and filopodia generation on fibrinogen, suggesting that PKCθ positively regulates outside-in signalling, in agreement with a previous report. In contrast, PKCθ−/− platelets also exhibited markedly enhanced GPVI-dependent α-granule secretion, although dense granule secretion was unaffected, suggesting that PKCθ differentially regulates these two granules. Inside-out regulation of αIIbβ3 activation was also enhanced downstream of GPVI stimulation. Although this did not result in increased aggregation, importantly thrombus formation on collagen under high shear (1000 s−1) was enhanced. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that PKCθ is an important negative regulator of thrombus formation on collagen, potentially mediated by α-granule secretion and αIIbβ3 activation. PKCθ therefore may act to restrict thrombus growth, a finding that has important implications for the development and safe clinical use of PKCθ inhibitors."

Klenk H. Virus Res. 1999; 60: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Specifically, the amino acid sequence REKR located at the C terminus of gp120 forms the furin recognition site. Mutations of this site result in unprocessed gp160 and a loss of function (7Freed E.O. Myers D.J. Risser R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4670-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bosch V. Pawlita M. J.

Based on amino acid sequence analyses, gp120 is composed of five conserved domains, termed C1–C5, and five variable domains, termed V1–V5 (9Douglas N. Munro G. Daniels R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 122-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There is substantial structural information for gp120 including the free state (10Chen B. Vogan E. Gong H. Skehel J. Wiley D. Harrison S. Nature. 2005; 433: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and the CD4-bound state (11Kwong P. Wyatt R. Robinson T. Sweet R. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.

Science. 2005; 310: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the gp120 core structure observed in the crystal structures is missing large regions of C1 and C5. Specifically, residues 31–82 of gp120-C1 and residues 493–511 of gp120-C5 are missing with respect to the mature HIV gp120. However, the structure of HIV gp120-C5 (residues 489–511) has been determined as an isolated domain by NMR spectroscopy (13Guilhaudis L. Jacobs A. Caffrey M. Eur. J.

In the present study, we report the first systematic mutation study of the importance of HIV gp120-C1 residues to envelope function with the long term goal of identifying gp120 regions that are attractive sites for drug intervention. We present evidence that gp120-C1 plays an important role in the processing of the furin recognition site, which is located within gp120-C5. Moreover, we find two regions of gp120-C1 that are important to the association of gp120 with gp41. Mutagenesis and Viral Entry Assays—Mutants were prepared from plasmid pCONBgp160opt (22Kothe D.

The functionality of gp120 mutants was determined in a luciferase-based entry assay (23Page K. Landau N. Littman D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this assay, plasmids pCONBgp160opt (bearing wild-type or mutant gp120) and pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- (24Connor R. Chen B. Choe S. Landau N. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) were co-transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into 293T cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the medium was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to make the virus stock. For assay of viral entry, U87.CD4.CCR5 cells (3Björndal A. Deng H. Jansson M. Fiore J.R. Colognesi C. Karlsson A. Albert J. Scarlatti G. Littman D.R. Fenyo E.M. J.

The following day, 500 μl of the virus stock was added to each of the wells of the U87 cells after removal of the medium. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After ∼16 h, the virus was aspirated and replaced with U87 medium, and the cells were allowed to rest for another 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system from Promega and a Berthold FB12 luminometer running Sirius software. The experiments were run in triplicate from transfection to assay of luciferase activity, and thus the uncertainties represent all stages of the experiment. In all cases, the viral entry levels fell within the linear range of detection (i.e. the values of the wild-type and mutants never exceeded 3 × 106 relative light units) (14Ivey-Hoyle M. Clark R. Rosenberg M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2682-2685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Entry levels were normalized to relative p24 levels observed in the Western blot of the virus, as described below. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were collected from 293T producer cells using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS). The virus pellet was prepared by ultracentrifugation on a cushion of 20% sucrose at 55,000 rpm for 35 min using a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. The virus pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS). After SDS-PAGE, transfer, and blocking of the membranes with 5% milk/TBST for gp41 and SuperBlock (Pierce) for gp120, the blots were probed with either goat anti-HIV-1 gp120 polyclonal antibody (U. S. Biological) or with mouse anti-HIV-1 gp41 monoclonal antibody (Chessie 8; National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) (22Kothe D. Decker J. Li Y. Weng Z.

The secondary antibody used was peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-goat or goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. and developed using the ECL kit (Pierce). The relative amount of envelope or p24 on the Western blots was determined by a densitometric analysis. Briefly, digital scans of the blots were opened in Photoshop 7.0, the image was inverted, the appropriate bands were selected with the Lasso function, and the mean intensity and area were measured with the Histogram function. Subsequently, the relative percentage was determined by the following relationship, Relative %=100×(Iexp×Aexp−Icont×Acont)/(Iwt×Awt−Icont×Acont) where I and A denote mean intensity and band area, respectively, and the subscripts exp, cont, and wt denote experimental, control (i.e. in the absence of envelope or pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- plasmid), and wild-type, respectively. The mean intensity and band area values used in this analysis are shown in Tables S1 and S2. Design of the HIV gp120-C1 Mutants—The location of gp120-C1 within the context of gp160 is shown in Fig. 1a. The N-terminal region of gp120-C1 is relatively conserved between HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV with ∼50% sequence identity (9Douglas N. Munro G. Daniels R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 122-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with the most conserved region, composed of hydrophobic residues, spanning residues 36–45. In the present study, 21 alanine substitutions of HIV-1 gp120-C1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1b). We have chosen to use the CONB envelope sequence, a consensus sequence of subtype B that is optimized for expression in mammalian cells and uses CCR5 as the co-receptor (22Kothe D. Decker J. Li Y.

Viral Entry of the HIV gp120-C1 Mutants—The effects of the gp120 mutations on viral entry were first tested by a luciferase-based assay, in which viral entry is proportional to the observed luciferase activity (14Ivey-Hoyle M.

Viral entry levels of wild-type and mutants are shown in Fig. 2. The mutational effects on viral entry can be divided into two classes: 1) functional, as defined by >20% entry with respect to wild type (E32A, K33A, I34A, V36A, T37A, K46A, E47A, T49A, T50A, and T51A); 2) impaired, as defined by <20% entry with respect to wild type (W35A, V38A, Y39A, Y40A, G41A, V42A, P43A, V44A, W45A, I52A, and F53A). With respect to the functional mutants, Val36 and Thr37 are highly conserved among HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV; however, substitution of these residues with alanine is a relatively conservative change. With respect to the impaired mutations, Val38, Tyr40, Gly41, Pro43, Trp45, and Phe53 are highly conserved among HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. Interestingly, many of the largest effects to entry occur in the hydrophobic region encompassing Val38–Trp45. Envelope Expression and Processing—A Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant envelope present in cell lysates was carried out to probe for mutational effects on expression and processing, as shown in Fig. 3. First note that the wild type shows the characteristic bands of gp160, gp120, and gp41, indicating that gp160 is expressed and processed by furin-like proteases to form mature gp120 and gp41. In the case of the mutants, the relatively high levels of gp160 present in cell lysates suggest that envelope expression has not been significantly affected by any of the substitutions. On the other hand, many of the mutations have reduced gp160 processing, as evidenced by reduced levels of gp120 and gp41. For example, W35A, V38A, Y39A, Y40A, G41A, V42A, P43A, W45A, I52A, and F53A exhibit undetectable or greatly reduced levels of gp120 and gp41 in the cell lysates, presumably due to a lack of processing by furin-like proteases. Not surprisingly, many of the mutants that display reduced gp160 processing also are impaired for viral entry (i.e. entry levels are <20% with respect to the wild type). V44A is a notable exception for which gp160 processing is not significantly affected but it nonetheless is impaired for viral entry. Virion Incorporation and gp120 Association with gp41—A Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant envelope present in purified virions was carried out to probe for mutational effects on envelope incorporation into virions and gp120 association with gp41 as well as to confirm the expression and processing results observed in cell lysates. Note that virion incorporation requires surface expression of envelope, which has been shown to be dependent upon proper folding and oligomerization (26Bird C. Gleeson P. McCluskey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19151-19157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Otteken A. Earl P. Moss B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3407-3415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Eligard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). The Western blot analysis of wild-type and mutant virions is shown in Fig. 4. The relative amounts of p24 were assayed as a loading control. The wild-type virions show the presence of gp160, gp120, and gp41. The presence of gp160 in virions has been previously attributed to saturation of furin-like proteases by overproduction of envelope (22Kothe D. Decker J. Li Y. Weng Z. Bibollet-Ruche F. Zammit K. Salazar M. Chen Y. Salazar-Gonzalez J. Moldoveanu Z. Mestecky J. Gao F. Haynes B. Shaw G. Muldoon M. Korber B. Hahn B.

Virol. 2002; 76: 2606-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the functional mutants (E32A, K33A, I34A, V36A, T37A, K46A, E47A, T49A, T50A, and T51A) exhibit the wild-type pattern, suggesting that envelope is incorporated into the virion and that gp120 remains noncovalently associated with gp41. The impaired mutants P43A and W45A exhibit lower levels of virion incorporation of envelope as evidenced by the presence of p24 and the absence of envelope, and thus these mutants may be less efficiently transported to the cell surface due to disruption of folding and/or oligomerization. Moreover, the absence of gp120 and gp41 in the P43A and W45A mutants implies that envelope processing has also been disrupted. The impaired mutants W35A, V38A, Y39A, Y40A, G41A, V42A, and I52A exhibit gp160, suggesting virion incorporation, but the absence or greatly reduced level of gp120 and gp41 suggests a processing defect, which is in agreement with the result for the Western blot of the cell lysates (Fig. 3). Impaired mutants V44A and F53A display bands for gp160, suggesting virion incorporation, and gp41, suggesting processing. In the case of F53A, the processing observed in virions is in disagreement with the lack of processing observed in cell lysates (compare Figs. 3 and 4); the underlying reasons for this discrepancy are not apparent at this time. Interestingly, the absence of gp120 in the impaired mutants V44A and F53A suggests that the gp120-gp41 interaction has been disrupted to result in “shedding.” Summary of the gp120-C1 Mutational Effects—The effects of the gp120-C1 alanine substitutions on viral entry; envelope expression, processing, and virion incorporation; and gp120-gp41 association are summarized in Table 1. Based on the data presented herein, a phenotype can be given for each of the mutants. For example, mutants E32A, K33A, I34A, V36A, T37A, K46A, E47A, T49A, T50A, and T51A are functional for viral entry (defined as >20% entry with respect to the wild type), and they exhibit the wild type pattern of gp160, gp120, and gp41 in cell extracts and virions. Consequently, this group is assigned a wild-type phenotype (Table 1). Impaired mutants P43A and W45A show reduced levels of virion incorporation and processing, and thus they exhibit a mixed phenotype. Impaired mutants W35A, V38A, Y39A, Y40A, G41A, V42A, and I52A exhibit a processing defect, as evidenced by decreased levels of gp120 and gp41 in cell lysates and virus (cf. Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1). Note that the Y40A substitution is found in some HIV-1 subtype O strains, which suggests that other mutations compensate to allow processing in these strains. Impaired mutants V44A and F53A exhibit a defect in gp120-gp41 association. In the case of V44A, the alanine substitution occurs in the HIV-2 and SIV envelope (Fig. 1), which suggests that other mutations compensate to stabilize gp120-gp41 association.TABLE 1Summary of viral entry and the level of envelope detected in cell lysates and virus of the wild-type and alanine mutants of HIV gp120-C1 Entry levels are reported as the percentage of entry with respect to the wild-type virus. The reported levels are normalized to p24 levels observed in the Western blot of the virus (see “Materials and Methods”). The reported errors correspond to the S.D. of three separate experiments.

For example, Ivey-Hoyle et al. (14Ivey-Hoyle M. Clark R. Rosenberg M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2682-2685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed that deletion of the 31 aminoterminal residues of gp120 (residues 31–57 of gp120-C1) (Fig. 1) did not disrupt envelope processing or CD4 binding but did result in dissociation of gp120 from gp41, which suggested that the gp120-C1 domain directly interacts with gp41. The V44A and F53A mutants of the present study, which are found within this region, also disrupt gp120 association with gp41 and thus support this notion. In another study, Helseth et al. (15Helseth E. Olshevsky U. Furman C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that single-site mutants V36L and Y40D were processed and bound CD4 but resulted in dissociation of gp120 from gp41. In the present study, the analogous mutant V36A exhibited a wild-type phenotype, with the difference presumably due to the nature of the substituting group (e.g. the leucine substitution is more bulky than valine and may result in steric hindrance). Moreover, the Y40A mutant of the present study disrupted envelope processing, with the difference probably due to the smaller and more hydrophobic nature of alanine with respect to aspartate. In addition, Helseth et al. (15Helseth E. Olshevsky U. Furman C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that mutant W45S reduced processing and gp120 association with gp41. In agreement, the analogous W45A mutant of the present study also reduced processing; however, the effects on gp120-gp41 association could not be assayed due to the complete absence of processing in this mutant. Finally, we note that the present study represents the first single site mutations to Glu32, Lys33, Ile34, Trp35, Thr37, Val38, Tyr39, Gly41, Val42, Pro43, Val44, Lys46, Glu47, Thr49, Thr50, Thr51, Ile52, and Phe53. Of the novel mutations, mutants W35A, V38A, Y49A, V42A, and I52A exhibit significantly impaired function due to processing defects, mutant P43A exhibits impaired function due to defects in processing and virion incorporation, and mutants V44A and F53A exhibit impaired function due to disruption of the gp120-gp41 association. Taken together, the gp120-C1 region plays important roles in envelope processing and stabilization of the gp120-gp41 interaction. Interactions of gp120-C1 in gp120/gp41—As mentioned in the Introduction, large regions of the gp120-C1 and gp120-C5 domains are missing from the available structures of the gp120 core (10Chen B. Vogan E. Gong H. Skehel J. Wiley D. Harrison S. Nature. 2005; 433: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 11Kwong P. Wyatt R. Robinson T. Sweet R. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar, 12Huang C. Tang M. Zhang M. Majeed S. Montabana E. Stanfield R. Dimitrov D. Korber B. Sodroski J. Wilson I. Science. 2005; 310: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and thus mutagenesis and immunological studies play important roles in the characterization of these domains, which are highly conserved between HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV (9Douglas N. Munro G. Daniels R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 122-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that single site mutational effects can be due to direct interactions or interactions propagated to more distant sites. Nonetheless, we would like to consider intermolecular interactions between gp120-C1 and gp120-C5 with the gp41 disulfide loop in processed gp160 (Fig. 5). The gp120-C1 domain is shown with the secondary structure predicted by Hansen et al. (30Hansen J. Lund O. Nielsen J. Brunak S. Hansen J. Proteins. 1996; 25: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The gp120-C5 structure is taken from Guilhaudis et al. (13Guilhaudis L. Jacobs A. Caffrey M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4860-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the gp41 disulfide loop structure is taken from Refs. 25Caffrey M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1536: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 31Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A. Clore G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar. Note that the gp120-C5 structure has the caveat that it was determined in the presence of 40% trifluoroethanol, a co-solvent that stabilizes helical structure, and in the absence of other gp120 and gp41 domains (13Guilhaudis L. Jacobs A. Caffrey M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4860-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The gp41 disulfide loop has the caveat that it is based on the postfusion form of gp41 (i.e. the six-helix bundle); however, we are not aware of any evidence for a large structural change of the disulfide loop during HIV entry. In Fig. 5, residues implicated by mutagenesis studies in forming intermolecular interactions in processed gp160 are shown in green. The interaction between Val44 and Phe53 of gp120-C1 and gp41 is based on the present work, in which single site mutations resulted in disruption of the gp120-gp41 interaction. The intermolecular interactions of Ile491 of gp120-C5 and Trp596 and Ser618 of the gp41 disulfide loop are based on previous mutagenesis studies, suggested by dissociation of gp120 from gp41 (19Jacobs A. Sen J. Rong L. Caffrey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27284-27288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Sen J. Jacobs A. Caffrey M. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7788-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The interaction between A501 of gp120-C5 and Thr605 of the gp41 disulfide loop is based on the SOS mutant of Binley et al. (16Binley J. Sanders R. Clas B. Schuelke N. Master A. Guo Y. Kajumo F. Anselma J. Maddon P. Olson W. Moore J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), in which the double mutant A501C/T605C was shown to form a nonnative disulfide bond, and thus a direct interaction between these residues was implied. As noted above, Val36, Tyr40, and Trp45 have also been previously implicated in forming intermolecular interactions with gp41, based on gp120 dissociation from gp41 (15Helseth E. Olshevsky U. Furman C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, immunological studies have also suggested interactions between the gp120-C1, gp120-C5, and the gp41 disulfide loop (17Moore J. Willey R. Lewis G. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6836-6847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wyatt R. Desjardin E. Olshevsky U. Nixon C. Binley J. Olshevsky V. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9722-9731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby supporting the schematic model of processed gp160. Finally, note that the topology of the gp120 core structures imply that gp120-C1 and -C5 are in close proximity (10Chen B. Vogan E. Gong H. Skehel J. Wiley D. Harrison S. Nature. 2005; 433: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 11Kwong P. Wyatt R. Robinson T. Sweet R. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar, 12Huang C. Tang M. Zhang M. Majeed S. Montabana E. Stanfield R. Dimitrov D. Korber B. Sodroski J. Wilson I. Science. 2005; 310: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Interactions of gp120-C1 in gp160—It is next of interest to examine potential long range intramolecular interactions between gp120-C1, gp120-C5, and the gp41 disulfide loop in unprocessed gp160. In Fig. 5, residues implicated in forming long range interactions with the furin recognition site in unprocessed gp160 are shown in blue. Specifically, the interaction between Trp35, Val38, Tyr39, Tyr40, Gly41, Val42, Pro43, Trp45, and Ile52 of gp120-C1 and the furin recognition site of gp120-C5 is based on the data presented herein, in which alanine substitutions resulted in severely decreased envelope processing. The interaction between Leu593 of the gp41 disulfide loop and the furin recognition site is based on a previous mutagenesis study (19Jacobs A. Sen J. Rong L. Caffrey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27284-27288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The notion that the gp41 disulfide bond interacts with gp120-C5 in gp160 is also supported by the mutagenesis study of Sen et al. (20Sen J. Jacobs A. Jiang H. Rong L. Caffrey M. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), who showed that the disulfide bond within the loop was important to gp160 processing. Interestingly, the present study suggests that long range interactions between gp120-C1 and gp120-C5, which encompasses the furin recognition site, occur in unprocessed gp160. Indeed, the impaired entry of many of the gp120-C1 mutants was due to a lack of processing, underscoring the importance of gp120-C1 residues to proper presentation of the gp120-C5 furin recognition site, a site that is ∼450 residues away (cf. Fig. 1). Ivey-Hoyle et al. (14Ivey-Hoyle M. Clark R. Rosenberg M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2682-2685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that deletion of the N-terminal 31 residues of gp120 (residues 31–57 of gp120-C1) (Fig. 1) does not significantly reduce envelope processing, which may appear to be in disagreement with the results presented herein. It is tempting to speculate that deletion of gp120-C1, in contrast to single site mutations, may remove residues with the potential to reduce access to the furin recognition site, thereby allowing envelope processing. In summary, the extreme sensitivity of gp120-C1 to alanine substitutions suggests that this region is an attractive and novel target for future drug discovery efforts. For example, compounds that bind to gp120-C1 may be expected to disrupt gp120 function and hence HIV entry, by disrupting either gp160 processing or gp120 association with gp41. Reagents pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-, pCONBgp160opt, U87.CD4.CCR5, and HIV-1 gp41 Hybridoma (Chessie 8) were obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Program.

https://openalex.org/W2134026863,"The mammalian neocortex is subdivided into many areas, each of which exhibits distinctive lamina architecture. To investigate such area differences in detail, we chose three genes for comparative analyses, namely, RORbeta, ER81 and Nurr1, mRNAs of which have been reported to be mainly expressed in layers 4, 5 and 6, respectively. To analyze their qualitative and quantitative coexpression profiles in the rat neocortex, we used double in situ hybridization (ISH) histochemistry and cortical box method which we previously developed to integrate the data of different staining and individuals in a standard three-dimensional space.Our new approach resulted in three main observations. First, the three genes showed unique area distribution patterns that are mostly complementary to one another. The patterns revealed by cortical box method matched well with the cytoarchitectonic areas defined by Nissl staining. Second, at single cell level, RORbeta and ER81 mRNAs were coexpressed in a subpopulation of layer 5 neurons, whereas Nurr1 and ER81 mRNAs were not colocalized. Third, principal component analysis showed that the order of hierarchical processing in the cortex correlates well with the expression profiles of these three genes. Based on this analysis, the dysgranular zone (DZ) in the somatosensory area was considered to exhibit a profile of a higher order area, which is consistent with previous proposal.The tight relationship between the expression of the three layer specific genes and functional areas were revealed, demonstrating the usefulness of cortical box method in the study on the cerebral cortex. In particular, it allowed us to perform statistical evaluation and pattern matching, which would become important in interpreting the ever-increasing data of gene expression in the cortex."

Settleman J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3214-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that new antitumor therapy should exploit nonapoptotic forms of programmed cell death to circumvent the apoptotic resistance of tumor cells. Yet this requires a deeper knowledge of nonapoptotic death programs at the molecular level. Therefore, any advance in our understanding of the mechanisms of killing these tumor cell-selective killers is of major interest. The adenovirus E4orf4 death factor triggers different death effector pathways (caspase-dependent and -independent), whose contributions to cell killing is determined by the genetic background (8Livne A. Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Robert A. Miron M.J. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Branton P.E. Lavoie J.N. J.

(2008) Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). Yet, in most transformed and cancer cell lines, E4orf4 triggers a p53- and caspase-independent death pathway that resists to Bcl-2 overexpression. Notwithstanding, this death pathway is associated with several apoptotic features, including cellular shrinkage and chromatin condensation, and it can be abrogated by perturbing intracellular signaling pathways, most notably, those controlling actin dynamics (9Robert A.

Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In fact, one major hallmark of this nonapoptotic death program is the early assembly of a peculiar and highly organized actomyosin network at the cell juxtanuclear region. Large-scale actin remodeling by E4orf4 relies on its ability to stimulate myosin II by enhancing the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain, thus generating high motor forces in the perinuclear region of the cell (14Robert A. Smadja-Lamere N. Landry M.C. Champagne C. Petrie R. Lamarche-Vane N. Hosoya H. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3329-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Induction of a dramatic cell blebbing process is preceded by the sudden collapse of this contractile network with or without cell detachment and marks the onset of apoptotic-like nuclear condensation. Because inhibition of myosin II can provide a marked protection against E4orf4 killing, we have proposed that some orderly lesions caused by increased cytoskeletal tension might contribute to engage the cell death pathway given that myosin II is the major motor protein responsible for the generation of internal cell tension (14Robert A. Smadja-Lamere N. Landry M.C. Champagne C. Petrie R. Lamarche-Vane N. Hosoya H. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3329-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Clark K. Langeslag M. Figdor C.G. van Leeuwen F.N. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 178-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this scenario, assembly of the peculiar juxtanuclear contractile network would be a consequence of the initial and lethal changes in actin dynamics rather than a cause of cell death. The effects of E4orf4 on the actin cytoskeleton are complex and poorly understood at the molecular level. The lethal changes in actin dynamics are controlled by several pathways involving Rho GTPase signaling downstream of Src-family kinases (14Robert A. Smadja-Lamere N. Landry M.C. Champagne C. Petrie R. Lamarche-Vane N. Hosoya H. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3329-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). E4orf4 associates with Src-family kinases and promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of targets having a common ability to regulate actin dynamics (13Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Champagne C. Landry M.C. Gingras M.C. Lavoie J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25905-25915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As a consequence, E4orf4 favors Src-dependent activation of the Rho GTPases Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA over that of key survival pathways, which rather show decreased Src-dependent activation. This is the case for focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ERK, two pathways providing critical survival signals in tumor cells (13Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Champagne C. Landry M.C. Gingras M.C. Lavoie J.N. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we have proposed that the resulting unbalance in Src signals might trigger the death of transformed and tumor cells expressing E4orf4. This presupposes that acute changes in actin dynamics induced by Src can commit tumor cells to a nonapoptotic death program when uncoupled from survival signals. Yet, these Src signaling pathways have remained enigmatic. We have shown that E4orf4-Src signaling induces a selective and sustained activation of Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), suggesting that the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway might transduce some Src pro-death signals (17Champagne C. Landry M.C. Gingras M.C. Lavoie J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25905-25915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is of particular interest given that Drosophila Rho and JNK orthologs have been recently implicated in the migration and apoptotic elimination of clonal patches of cells displaying activated Src kinases (19Vidal M. Larson D.E. Cagan R.L. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Yet the functional relevance of JNK activation in response to E4orf4 has not been addressed, and whether it is activated downstream of Rho GTPases is unknown. JNK proteins have a clear role in stress-induced apoptosis by virtue of their function in gene expression and of their ability to phosphorylate several members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins controlling the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (20Bode A.M. Dong Z. Mol. Carcinog. 2007; 46: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Bogoyevitch M.A. Kobe B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 1061-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the JNK pathway also promotes cell proliferation, survival, and migration, depending on the physiological context and spatiotemporal mode of activation. It is becoming clear that JNK is a common downstream target of signaling pathways controlling cell movement; notably, Rho GTPases and JNK activation is correlated with an increase in cell migration in several systems (22Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4619-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 23Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that paxillin, an adaptor protein involved in focal adhesion (FA) organization, is an important mediator of JNK signaling in cell migration. How exactly JNK-mediated phosphorylation of paxillin regulates adhesion dynamics and whether it contributes to the pro-death function of JNK remain unknown. Mechanical forces generated by myosin II-based contractility inside the cell have a key role in the regulation of basic cellular functions including cell proliferation and survival, and these forces are sensed at cell-matrix adhesion sites (15Clark K. Langeslag M. Figdor C.G. van Leeuwen F.N. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 178-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Huang S. Ingber D.E. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 175-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because E4orf4 killing depends on the activation of myosin II, we have postulated that deregulation of adhesion dynamics might be among the initial lesions engaging the death pathway in tumor cells. Herein, we show that JNK is activated in part through a pathway involving Src-Rho-Rho kinase (ROCK) in response to E4orf4 and is required for induction of the initial cytoskeletal changes triggering the death of tumor cells. Strong evidence is presented that paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-178 by JNK promotes FA stabilization, leading to the formation of atypically enlarged adhesions that support E4orf4-induced cell tension and killing in MCF7 cells. We propose a model whereby E4orf4 perturbs tensional homeostasis in tumor cells by hijacking a Src-Rho-ROCK pathway that controls cell tension and adhesion dynamics via the concerted action of myosin II and JNK/paxillin.

The HP Validated siRNA were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); human JNK1 (HS_MAPK8_13_HP and HS_MAPK8-_12_HP, referred here as JNK1a and JNK1b, respectively), human JNK2 (HS_MAPK9_5_HP and HS_MAPK9_7_HP, referred here to JNK2a and JNK2b, respectively), and the All Stars Negative Control and GFP-22 (3′-labeled with rhodamine 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) siRNAs, which were used as controls in siRNA experiments. Cell Culture and Biochemistry—293T and MCF7 cells were derived from human embryonic kidney cells and from human mammary adenocarcinoma, respectively (30Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar, 31Soule H.D. Vazguez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). 293T were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and MCF7 in ;-minimum Eagle's medium, both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MCF7 were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for plasmid DNA or using the TransIT-TKO reagent for siRNA (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) or were infected with AdGFP or AdE4orf4 at a multiplicity of infection of 75-100 plaque-forming units per cell. 293T were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described (13Lavoie J.N.

Western blot analyses were done as described (13Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. Densitometric analyses were performed from FluorS MAX Multiimager-captured images using the Quantity 1-D software version 4.6.0 (Bio-Rad). Activator protein-1 (AP-1)-dependent transcription was measured using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays (32Guertin M. LaRue H. Bernier D. Wrange O. Chevrette M. Gingras M.C. Belanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1398-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The reporter 3AP-1Col was generated by cloning the AP-1 sequence of the collagenase promotor upstream of thymidine kinase minimal promoter of the TK-CAT vector (33Bernier D. Thomassin H. Allard D.

Transfections were normalized using a Luciferase reporter at a plasmid DNA ratio 1:10. Immunofluorescence, Microscopy, and Image Processing—Microscopic analyses and DNA condensation assays were performed 24 h after transfection. DNA was labeled with cell-permeable Hoechst (33342) before cell fixation, and cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in Luftig buffer (0.2 m sucrose, 35 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgSO4) for 20 min at 37 °C (34Luftig R.B. McMillan P.N. Weatherbee J.A. Weihing R.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When indicated in the figure legends, cells were extracted in situ before fixation in cytoskeleton extraction buffer (0.02% Triton-X-100, 10 mm MES, pH 6.1, 138 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 ;g/ml phalloidin) for 8 min at 4 °C to reveal proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton (35Ivanov A.I. Hunt D. Utech M. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2636-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Fixation-induced fluorescence was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min at room temperature, and immunostaining was performed as described (14Robert A. Smadja-Lamere N. Landry M.C. Champagne C. Petrie R. Lamarche-Vane N. Hosoya H. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3329-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fixed cells were mounted in a 50:50 mix of glycerol and glycine buffer pH 8.6 (0.2 m glycine 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% NaN3). Confocal microscopy of fixed specimen was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 mounted on a Nikon TE-200 inverted microscope with a 60× oil 1.4 NA objective. Acquisitions were taken on separate channels with appropriate restrictive filters. The Metamorph 4.5 software (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) and Photoshop CS3 software (Adobe) were used for processing of the overall images before cell cropping to emphasize the main point of the image. Processing was limited to background subtraction and brightness/contrast adjustments. For quantitative fluorescence analyses of endogenous paxillin, confocal images were acquired using the same parameters (gain and laser power), exported in TIFF format, and analyzed with the ImageJ 1.38 software (NIH) using the Measure Average Intensity function, calculated from a selected area corresponding to the entire cell. For quantitative average area of FA, the Measure Area function was used, calculated from a selected area corresponding to the FA. An average area value was calculated for each cell, and then, an average area value was calculated for each treatment. For quantitative analyses of paxillin p-Ser-178 intensity ratios, cells were imaged using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 mounted on a Nikon TE-200 inverted microscope with a 20× air 0.5 NA objective, with the pinhole completely open. Then fields were selected on the coverslips containing both E4orf4-mRFP-positive cells and negative cells (non-transfected cells). To minimize the variability due to differences in cell size (late stage blebbing cells), only cells whose area is 1000 ± 200 ;m2 (our estimated average area of MCF7 cells) were included. All the images were taken with identical acquisition parameters optimized for the fluorescent signals to be in the dynamic range. Under those conditions, the amount of p-Pax(Ser-178) is proportional to the total fluorescence, which was analyzed using the ImageJ 1.38 software (NIH). A ratio of intensity of p-Pax-(Ser-178) in E4orf4-expressing cells was calculated relative to E4orf4-negative cells for each individual experiment (sample) to minimize the variability due to differences in staining intensity. FRAP and Time-lapse Analyses—For live microscopy, cells were incubated in media with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and imaged using an Olympus FV1000 confocal equipped with a 60× NA 1.4 objective and a temperature-controlled chamber driven by the FluoView software (Olympus, Markam, ON, Canada). FRAP analyses were performed 24 h after transfection according to the method previously described (36Wasiak S. Zunino R. McBride H.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 37Goodwin J.S. Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2005; 37: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Images were acquired every 0.7 s for 90 s. Five images were acquired before photobleaching of a region of interest (ROI) with the 405-nm laser using the tornado setting during 1 frame. To directly compare recovery curves from different treatments, data were normalized for background fluorescence (Fbkgd) and loss of fluorescence during the bleach using F(t)norm = 100 × (F(t)ROI - Fbkgd)(Fi cell - Fbkgd)/(F(t)cell - Fbkgd)(Fi ROI - Fbkgd), where F(t)ROI = ROI intensity, F(t)cell = total cell intensity at any given time point (t), Fi ROI = initial intensity of the ROI, and Fi cell = initial intensity of the entire cell. The resulting normalized data were then averaged for different cells, and the associated S.D. were calculated with Excel 11.3.8 software (Microsoft). The mobile fraction (Mf) was calculated according to Mf = 100 × (F∞ - F0)/(Fi - F0), where F∞, F0, and Fi are the normalized fluorescence intensities at the asymptote, determined immediately after the bleach and before the bleach, respectively. Nonlinear regression (curve fit) was used to calculate the half-time of recovery (t½) using the R freeware 2.5.1 software (Boston, MA). Time-lapse acquisitions used low power illumination to protect cells from light damage and limit photobleaching. Statistical Analyses—For statistical analyses, a one-way analysis of variance test was used with p values of <0.05 considered significant (p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***)). The Prism 5.0a software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used to compare mean values of individual experiments, whereas the SAS/STAT 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to compare all single cell measurements from each treatment of individual experiments. JNK Activation in Response to E4orf4 Involves a Src-Rho-ROCK Signaling Axis—The ability of E4orf4 to associate with and dysregulate Src-family kinase signaling causes the activation of several Rho GTPase pathways that comes along with increased JNK activity (14Robert A.

Activation of endogenous JNK1 and JNK2 was monitored by Western blot using a phosphospecific antibody to the dually phosphorylated Thr-183/Tyr-185 or a phosphospecific antibody that recognized phospho-c-Jun. Consistent with previous work (17Champagne C. Landry M.C. Gingras M.C. Lavoie J.N. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1978829877,"CHP2 (calcineurin B homologous protein 2) was initially identified as a tumor-associated antigen highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Its biological function remains largely unknown except for a potential role in transmembrane Na+/H+ exchange. In the present study, we observed that ectopic expression of CHP2 promoted the proliferation of HEK293 cells, whereas knockdown of endogenous CHP2 expression in HepG2 inhibited cell proliferation. When inoculated into nude mice, CHP2 transfected HEK293 cells displayed markedly increased oncogenic potential. In analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that like calcineurin B, CHP2 was able to bind to and stimulate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin A. In accord with this, CHP2-transfected cells showed increased nuclear presence of NFATc3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and enhanced NFAT activity. Finally, both accelerated cell proliferation and NFAT activation following CHP2 transfection could be suppressed by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A, suggesting an intrinsic connection between these events. Taken together, our results highlighted a potential role of CHP2 in tumorigenesis and revealed a novel function of CHP2 as an activator of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway.

When inoculated into nude mice, CHP2 transfected HEK293 cells displayed markedly increased oncogenic potential. In analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that like calcineurin B, CHP2 was able to bind to and stimulate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin A. In accord with this, CHP2-transfected cells showed increased nuclear presence of NFATc3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and enhanced NFAT activity. Finally, both accelerated cell proliferation and NFAT activation following CHP2 transfection could be suppressed by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A, suggesting an intrinsic connection between these events. Taken together, our results highlighted a potential role of CHP2 in tumorigenesis and revealed a novel function of CHP2 as an activator of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. Calcineurin, a serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase, is an important mediator in the calcium signaling pathways. It is normally composed of catalytic subunit calcineurin A (CnA) 4The abbreviations used are: CnA, calcineurin A; CnB, calcineurin B; CaM, calmodulin; CHP, calcineurin homologous protein; CsA, cyclosporine A; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 4The abbreviations used are: CnA, calcineurin A; CnB, calcineurin B; CaM, calmodulin; CHP, calcineurin homologous protein; CsA, cyclosporine A; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and regulatory subunit calcineurin B (CnB). In response to elevated levels of intracellular calcium, the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is fully activated upon calcium-dependent binding of calmodulin (CaM) to the CnA-CnB complex (1Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 2Shibasaki F. Hallin U. Uchino H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) is a major substrate of calcineurin. Among the five known members of the NFAT family, four contain docking sites for and are regulated by calcineurin. In resting cells, the NFAT proteins are hyperphosphorylated and reside within the cytoplasm. Calcineurin activation induced by a number of extracellular stimuli results in rapid dephosphorylation of NFAT molecules and their translocation to the nucleus. Once located in the nucleus, NFAT binds to and induces the transcription of target genes, either by itself or in combination with other factors (3Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 15: 771-774Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4Hogan P. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 5Macian F. Nat. Rev.

Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). More recently, NFAT have also been shown to participate in the transcriptional control of many other genes related to cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (3Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 15: 771-774Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 4Hogan P. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Given the fundamental nature of the cellular processes it regulates, it comes as no surprise that deregulation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling and/or abnormal expression of its components are reported to be associated with a number of human malignancies (6Buchholz M. Ellenrieder V. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Lu H. Huang C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2007; 7: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Medyouf H. Ghysdael J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The activity of calcineurin is tightly regulated. In the past few years, several endogenous inhibitors have been discovered, which include calcineurin-binding protein 1 (Cabin1/Cain) (9Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O.

The last two are of particular interest for their sequence similarity to CnB. As a ubiquitously expressed molecule, CHP1 demonstrates diversified biological activities. In addition to being a cofactor for Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) (17Pang T. Su X. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17367-17372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and a modulator for the organization and assembly of microtubule cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum (18Andrade J. Zhao H. Titus B. Pearce S.T. Barroso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), CHP1 serves as a negative regulator in calcineurin/NFAT signaling (15Lin X. Sikkink R.A. Rusnak F. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36125-36131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In cells overexpressing CHP1, both the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and the transcriptional activity of NFAT are significantly reduced, probably due to impaired assembly of CnA-CnB-CaM heterotrimers in the presence of CHP1. CHP3/tescalcin was initially identified as a transcript preferentially expressed in testis, but subsequent studies demonstrated abundant expression of CHP3 in several other tissues, including heart, brain, and stomach (16Gutierrez-Ford C. Levay K. Gomes A.V. Perera E.M. Som T. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Berkovitz G.D. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14553-14565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar to CHP1, recombinant CHP3 inhibits CaM-stimulated CnA activity in reconstituted assays (16Gutierrez-Ford C. Levay K. Gomes A.V. Perera E.M. Som T. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Berkovitz G.D. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14553-14565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic expression of CHP3 up-regulates the cell surface activity of NHE1 (19Zaun H.C. Shrier A. Orlowsk J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12456-12467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the search for tumor-associated antigens expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, we identified another calcineurin homologous protein. This protein was initially designated as HCA520 (hepatocellular carcinoma antigen 520), but renamed CHP2 on the basis of a high degree of sequence identity to CnB (54%) and CHP1 (61%) (20Wang Y. Han K.J. Pang X.W. Vaughan H.A. Qu W. Dong X.Y. Peng J.R. Zhao H.T. Rui J.A. Leng X.S. Cebon J. Burgess A.W. Chen W.F. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43771-43777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wide distribution of CHP1, CHP2 expression in normal tissues is, if any, extremely low. On the other hand, high levels of CHP2 mRNA are frequently detected in malignant tissues. Such a pattern implies a potential role for CHP2 in tumorigenesis. In fact, an earlier study by Pang et al. (21Pang T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43771-43777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicated that CHP2 may increase the viability of malignant cells by maintaining high intracellular pH through serum-independent activation of NHE1. In view of the multiple biological functions of CHP1 that have been identified, we wonder whether CHP2 is involved in the regulation of cellular functions other than Na+/H+ exchange, which in turn may contribute to its oncogenic potential. In the present study, we examined alterations in cell behavior following CHP2 overexpression, and sought to determine the molecular mechanisms by which CHP2 exerts its function, with special attention to the influence on phosphatase activity of calcineurin and the downstream signaling pathway. Materials—CHP2, CnA, CnB, and CaM recombinant proteins were prepared in Escherichia coli as previously described (22Qin Y. Liu J. Li X. Wei Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1747: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 23Han K.J. Yang M.X. Wang Y. Li Y. Chen W.F. Chin. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 19: 31-35Google Scholar, 24Wei Q. Lee E.Y. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 169-177PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-CHP2 antibody was generated in rabbit by immunizing with recombinant CHP2. Other antibodies used in the study were obtained from various commercial sources: anti-β-actin from Beijing Ding Guo Chang Sheng Biotechnology Corporation (Beijing, China); anti-FLAG from Sigma; anti-Histone H3.1 from Signalway Antibody Company (Pearland, TX); anti-α-tubulin 1 from Proteintech Group Incorporation (Chicago, IL); anti-CnA from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); and anti-pan-NFAT (sc-1149), NFATc1 (sc-7294), NFATc2 (sc-7295), NFATc3 (sc-8405), and NFATc4 (sc-1153A) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Cultures—Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, liver immortalized cell line LO2, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, and cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% neonatal calf serum supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and sodium bicarbonate (2.2 g/liter). T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) medium containing 10% neonatal calf serum supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Construction and Transfection—pcDNA3-Flag-CHP2 and pEGFP-CHP2 expression vectors were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) or calcium phosphate precipitation. Stable transfectants were obtained by selection in G418 (2 mg/ml), and subcloned by limiting dilution. For transient transfection, cells were co-transfected with 8 μg of pcDNA3-Flag-CHP2 and 1 μg of pEGFP plasmid in 60-mm dishes. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive population was sorted out for further analysis 24 h after transfection. Cells transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector served as a mock control. RNA Interference—Three putative siRNA oligos (siRNAi#1, GGG AGA CCG AAU UAU AGA A; siRNA#2, GAA GGA ACA AAC UUC ACU A; siRNA#3, CAG AAG AGC AGC UGG AGA A) and a non-silencing control (UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG U) were synthesized at GenePharma Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and tested for their capacity to quench fluorescence in co-transfection with pEGFP-CHP2. To inhibit endogenous CHP2 expression, siRNA#2 (20 nm) were transfected into HepG2 cells using the INTERFERin reagent (Polyplus-transfection Inc., Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR amplifications were performed using the following primers: 5′-GGA CAG TAT TCG GCG AGA GAC C-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAG TTT ATT GTC GCC CTG CGT C-3′ (reverse) for CHP2; 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′(forward) and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′ (reverse) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels. Cell Proliferation Analysis—To determine the cell growth rate, CHP2 stable transfectants and the mock control were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well. At each time point, cells from three independent wells were collected by trypsinization and counted with a hemocytometer. For proliferation assay by [3H]TdR incorporation, stable or transient transfectants (24 h after transfection) were seeded in 96-well culture plates in triplicate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24, 48, or 72 h. [3H]TdR (Beijing Atomic Energy Institute, China) was added at 0.5 μCi (18.5 KBq)/well 12 h before the end of culture. Cells were collected with Harvester 96 Mach II (Tomtec Inc., Hamden, CT) and the counts/min value for each well was determined with scintillation fluid on a β-counter. Inoculation of Nude Mice—HEK293 transfectants were tested for their tumorigenic potential in vivo using nude mice. Five 6-week-old male BALB/c-nu/nu mice were included in each group. In subcutaneous models, 2 × 106 cells suspended in 0.2 ml of PBS were injected into the right flank of each mouse at a single site. Tumor length and width were measured every 3 days after injection. Volume was calculated as length × (width2/2). For intraperitoneal inoculation, 2 × 106 cells suspended in 1 ml of PBS were injected into the lower right abdomen. All mice were kept in aseptic cages and sacrificed 2 months after inoculation by cervical dislocation. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to inspect tumor cell invasion into host tissues using anti-CHP2 antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation of Calcineurin and CHP2 in Vivo—1 × 107 CHP2 stable transfectants or mock controls were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-CnA antibodies or control IgG. The immune complex was precipitated using Protein-A-agarose beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The blot was then probed with anti-CnA or anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. Pull-down Assay—CnA was incubated with CHP2 and CnB at different molar ratios in a reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2) for 2 h at 4°C. The protein mixture was then further incubated with CaM-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with the reaction buffer on a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with the reaction buffer, the protein was eluted from the Sepharose beads into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA. Proteins in the supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Extraction of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Protein and Western Blot—CHP2 stable transfectants or mock controls were collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in buffer A (2 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). The thoroughly mixed samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and followed by addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1.2% (buffer B). The cells were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic extract. The nuclear pellet was extracted with 50 μl of buffer C (2 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 10% glycerol) for 30 min on a rocking platform. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected as nuclear extract. Proteins from equal numbers of cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto membrane, and probed with appropriate antibodies. Measurement of Calcineurin Phosphatase Activity—Protein phosphatase activity of CnA was determined using either p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Sigma) or γ-32P-labeled RII peptide (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as substrate as previously described (25Liu P. Huang C. Jia Z. Yi F. Yu D.Y. Wei Q. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The regulatory potential of CHP2 was evaluated by the relative activity of CnA at different doses of CHP2 with or without CaM. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cell suspension was dropped on sterile glass slides at the bottom of 6-well plate. After overnight culture at 37 °C, slides were fixed with cold acetone, air-dried, washed in PBS, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Then, HEK293 transfectants were incubated with rabbit anti-pan-NFAT antibodies for 30 min at 25 °C. Wild type HEK293 cells were incubated with isotype-matched control antibodies. After washing, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for a further 30 min incubation at 25 °C. Nucleus was visualized by Hoechst 33342 staining. Single color images (fluorescein isothiocyanate or Hoechst) were acquired on a LEICA Q550CW microscope and analyzed using the software Qwin. Luciferase Reporter Assay—0.5 μg of NFAT luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pRL-SV40 plasmid were co-transfected into a HEK293 stable transfectant and a mock control. pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid was added as an internal control to normalize the transfection efficiency. Luciferase reporter assays were performed using Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). To test whether the increased NFAT activity resulted from calcineurin activation, CsA (Sigma) was added 6 h before cell harvesting to block calcineurin function. Statistical Analysis—Data were presented as mean ± S.D. and significant differences were defined as p < 0.05, which was determined by the software SPSS 11.0 for Windows. One-way analysis of variance with LSD test was performed for multiple comparisons and t test was used for paired samples. CHP2 Accelerates Cell Proliferation—Previous studies have documented much increased expression of CHP2 in a variety of tumor tissues (20Wang Y. Han K.J. Pang X.W. Vaughan H.A. Qu W. Dong X.Y. Peng J.R. Zhao H.T. Rui J.A. Leng X.S. Cebon J. Burgess A.W. Chen W.F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Pang T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43771-43777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR, we further examined its expression in established cell lines. Fig. 1A showed the results of a few representative lines HEK293, LO2, HepG2, Jurkat, and HeLa, which were used in subsequent studies. To explore the potential contribution of CHP2 to tumorigenesis, we attempted to enforce CHP2 expression in an otherwise non-expressing cell line HEK293. Among the multiple stable transfectants we obtained, clone 4G9 expressed the transgene at a level similar to that in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and was thus chosen as a representative in most of the subsequent studies. Fig. 1B showed CHP2 mRNA and protein expression in this specific clone in comparison with a mock control. At each time point examined over the course of an 8-day culture, the CHP2 stable transfectant constantly produced more cells than the mock control (Fig. 1C). Given that there was no obvious difference in cell death between the two cultures (<5% in both), the cell number increase is most likely to be the result of accelerated proliferation. In support, [3H]TdR incorporation assays demonstrated that thymidine uptake by the CHP2 transfectant was about 3-fold more than that by the mock control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1D). To exclude the possibility that the observed effect might be due to some unknown genetic events unique for clone 4G9, two additional clones (4B7 and 4D10) were tested. Similar results were obtained. More intriguingly, the magnitude of the proliferative response seemed to be correlated with the expression levels of the transgene (Fig. 1E). As further evidence, enhanced cell proliferation was also observed with transiently transfected HEK293 cells in bulk cultures (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1F). Moreover, the proliferation-enhancing effect was not restricted to HEK293 cells. LO2, a human liver cell line, showed the same trend following transfection with CHP2 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1F). CHP2 effect on cell proliferation was further investigated using the technique of RNA interference to knockdown endogenous CHP2 expression in HepG2 cells. Three siRNA oligos were thus synthesized, and tested for their capacity to inhibit the expression of GFP-CHP2 fusion proteins by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with pEGFP-CHP2 and the oligos. siRNA#2 (GAA GGA ACA AAC UUC ACU A) showed the most potent inhibition, and was therefore used in subsequent experiments (Fig. 2A). In HepG2 cells, the mRNA level of endogenous CHP2 was substantially reduced following transfection with siRNA#2 (Fig. 2B). At the same time, the proliferation of siRNA#2 transfectants was found to be significantly suppressed in comparison with that of untreated or non-silencing siRNA-transfected cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). Again, these results support an important role of CHP2 in the regulation of cell proliferation. CHP2 Promotes the Oncogenic Potential of HEK293 Cells—We next examined whether CHP2 overexpression altered the tumorigenic capacity of HEK293 cells in vivo. When cells were inoculated subcutaneously, tumors formed in the CHP2 group were consistently larger in size than those in the mock control group (Fig. 3, A and B). Nevertheless, no tumor metastasis was detected in either group by immunohistochemistry or hematoxylin-eosin staining (data not shown). In intraperitoneal inoculation, palpable tumors formed within a week with the CHP2 transfectant, whereas it took about 2 weeks with the mock control. At the end, the total mass of the tumors harvested from the CHP2 group was about 3 times more than that of the control group (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the CHP2 transfectant appeared to be more aggressive, invading into many abdominal organs, such as spleen, liver, and kidney (Fig. 3D), whereas no HEK293 cells were found in any of these organs in the controls (data not shown). These data indicate that CHP2 overexpression significantly increased the tumorigenic capacity of HEK293 cells. CHP2 Binds to CnA in Vivo and in Vitro—CHPs share a high degree of homology with the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, CnB. Previous studies have reported that CHP1 is able to bind to the catalytic subunit, CnA, and exert a substantial influence on the enzymatic activity (15Lin X. Sikkink R.A. Rusnak F. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36125-36131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This, together with the accumulating evidence for a critical role of calcineurin signaling in the regulation of cell growth (26Kahl C.R. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate the possibility that CHP2 may also bind to CnA and affect the proliferation of HEK293 cells by regulating calcineurin activity. Using immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that CHP2 proteins were co-precipitated with CnA in CHP2-transfected cells. Similarly, CnA was detected in the immune complex precipitated by anti-FLAG antibodies recognizing the exogenous CHP2 (Fig. 4A). The physical interaction between CHP2 and CnA was confirmed in pull-down assay. Like CnB, CHP2 was pulled down by CaM-Sepharose, but only in the presence of CnA (Fig. 4B). Using this assay, we further analyzed the competitive binding to CnA by CHP2 and CnB. The two proteins were thus mixed at a molar ratio of 0.5–8, and incubated with CnA. The relative amount of CHP2 and CnB precipitated by CaM-Sepharose was then compared. With the increase of input CHP2, CnB proteins recovered progressively decreased while increasingly more CHP2 proteins were recovered (Fig. 4C). Specifically, almost equal amounts of CHP2 and CnB were pulled down at a molar ratio of 1 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that CHP2 and CnB may have a similar affinity for CnA. CHP2 Enhances the Phosphatase Activity of CnA—In reconstitution assays with purified recombinant proteins, the impact of CHP2 on the phosphatase activity of CnA was directly evaluated. As expected, CnA by itself had limited efficacy in dephosphorylating the substrate pNPP, but its activity was dramatically increased with the addition of CnB and CaM. Interestingly, comparable levels of CnA activation could also be achieved when CnB was substituted by CHP2. In both cases, calcium appeared to be required as CnA activation was being suppressed with increasing concentrations of EGTA (Fig. 5A). Further analysis revealed a dose-dependent response. In the range of 0.5–4 μm, CHP2 caused a steady increase of CnA activity (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5B, left). Moreover, CHP2 was found to act synergistically with CaM. Although CnA activity was doubled with 2 μm CaM alone, a maximum 6-fold increase was achieved in the presence of both CaM and CHP2 (Fig. 5B, right). Subsequently, we tested γ-32P-labeled RII peptide, a more physiologically relevant substrate of CnA, in such assays. Similar results were obtained. A nearly 3-fold increase in CnA activity was achieved with 1.6 μm CHP2 alone (Fig. 5C, left), whereas the combination of CHP2 and CaM caused a maximum of 8-fold increase in CnA activity (Fig. 5C, right). CHP2 Promotes NFAT Translocation and Activation—The results described above demonstrated that CHP2 may directly interact with CnA and result in the activation of calcineurin. The next question is how this would affect the activity of NFAT, a well known substrate of calcineurin. We first examined the subcellular localization of NFAT following CHP2 overexpression in HEK293 cells. Immunofluorescent staining with pan-NFAT antibodies demonstrated that the NFAT protein was primarily localized in the cytoplasm of the parent HEK293 cells, but mainly detected in the nuclei of CHP2-transfected cells (Fig. 6A), indicating that overexpression of CHP2 induces the nuclear translocation of NFAT. To confirm this result and elucidate the specific NFAT isoforms involved, Western blot analysis was performed. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were thus prepared from CHP2 transfectants and mock controls, and examined for the expression of NFATc1 and NFATc3, the two NFAT isoforms found in HEK293 cells (data not shown). Surprisingly, whereas NFAT proteins were exclusively found in the cytoplasm of unstimulated Jurkat cells, significant amounts of NFAT proteins were detected in the nuclear fraction of HEK293 cells, suggesting a low level of constitutive activation. Nevertheless, in comparison with the mock control, the CHP2 transfectant showed much increased nuclear accumulation of NFATc3. The partition of NFATc1, on the other hand, was largely unaffected (Fig. 6B). In view of the complexity introduced by the basal level of NFAT activation in HEK293 cells, the nuclear translocation of NFATc3 induced by CHP2 was further examined in HeLa cells with no noticeable endogenous NFAT activity. When cells were transfected with pEGFP-NFATc3 and mock control, the fusion protein was mainly seen in the cytoplasm.

Methodology/Principal Findings Here we demonstrate that the hybridization intensity of genomic DNA is a poor basis on which to select unbiased probes on Affymetrix expression arrays for studies of comparative transcriptomics, and that doing so produces spurious results. We used the Affymetrix Xenopus laevis microarray to evaluate expression divergence between X. laevis, X. borealis, and their F1 hybrids. When data are analyzed with probes that interrogate only sequences with confirmed identity in both species, we recover results that differ substantially analyses that use genomic DNA hybridizations to select probes. Conclusions/Significance Our findings have implications for the experimental design of comparative expression studies that use single-species microarrays, and for our understanding of divergent expression in hybrid clawed frogs. These findings also highlight important limitations of single-species microarrays for studies of comparative transcriptomics of polyploid species."
https://openalex.org/W2100974058,"Circulating monocytes, as dendritic cell and macrophage precursors, exhibit several functions usually associated with antigen-presenting cells, such as phagocytosis and presence of endosomal/lysosomal degradative compartments particularly enriched in Lamp-1, MHC class II molecules, and other proteins related to antigen processing and MHC class II loading [MHC class II compartments (MIICs)]. Ultrastructural analysis of these organelles indicates that, differently from the multivesicular bodies present in dendritic cells, in monocytes the MIICs are characterized by a single perimetral membrane surrounding an electron-dense core. Analysis of their content reveals enrichment in myeloperoxidase, an enzyme classically associated with azurophilic granules in granulocytes and mast cell secretory lysosomes. Elevation in intracellular free calcium levels in monocytes induced secretion of beta-hexosaminidase, cathepsins, and myeloperoxidase in the extracellular milieu; surface up-regulation of MHC class II molecules; and appearance of lysosomal resident proteins. The Ca(2+)-regulated surface transport mechanism of MHC class II molecules observed in monocytes is different from the tubulovesicular organization of the multivesicular bodies previously reported in dendritic cells and macrophages. Hence, in monocytes, MHC class II-enriched organelles combine degradative functions typical of lysosomes and regulated secretion typical of secretory lysosomes. More important, Ca(2+)-mediated up-regulation of surface MHC class II molecules is accompanied by extracellular release of lysosomal resident enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2017959747,"Background In recent years T cell based interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have been developed for immunodiagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection. At present these assays do not discriminate between disease and latency. Therefore, more promising antigens and diagnostic tools are continuously being searched for tuberculosis immunodiagnostics. The heparin binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) is a surface protein of M. tuberculosis which promotes bacterial aggregation and adhesion to non-phagocytic cells. It has been previously assumed that native, methylated form of this protein would be a promising antigen to discriminate latent from active infection. Methodology and Principal Findings We performed a pilot investigation to study humoral and T-cell mediated immunological responses to recombinant HBHA produced in M. smegmatis or to synthetic peptides in patients with recent or past tuberculosis, with atypical mycobacteriosis, or in healthy vaccinated individuals. The T cell reactivities to HBHA were compared to the respective reactivities towards Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) and two surface secreted proteins, ie. Early Secretory Antigen Target-6 (ESAT-6) and Culture Filtrate Protein-10 (CFP-10). Our pilot results indicate that methylated recombinant HBHA induced a strong T cell mediated immune response and the production of IgG and IgM-class antibodies in all patient groups, most surprisingly in young Finnish vaccinees, as well. We observed a positive correlation between the reactivities to HBHA and non-specific PPD among all studied subjects. As expected, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 were the most powerful antigens to discriminate disease from immunity caused by vaccination. Conclusions On the basis of results of this exploratory investigation we raise concerns that in countries like Finland, where BCG vaccination was routinely used, HBHA utility might not be sufficient for diagnostics because of inability to explicitly discriminate tuberculosis infection from immunoreactivity caused by previous BCG vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2079025329,"Background Fiber fuse is a process of optical fiber destruction under the action of laser radiation, found 20 years ago. Once initiated, opical discharge runs along the fiber core region to the light source and leaves periodic voids whose shape looks like a bullet pointing the direction of laser beam. The relation between damage pattern and propagation mode of optical discharge is still unclear even after the first in situ observation three years ago. Methodology/Principal Findings Fiber fuse propagation over hetero-core splice point (Corning SMF-28e and HI 1060) was observed in situ. Sequential photographs obtained at intervals of 2.78 µs recorded a periodic emission at the tail of an optical discharge pumped by 1070 nm and 9 W light. The signal stopped when the discharge ran over the splice point. The corresponding damage pattern left in the fiber core region included a segment free of periodicity. Conclusions The spatial modulation pattern of the light emission agreed with the void train formed over the hetero-core splice point. Some segments included a bullet-shaped void pointing in the opposite direction to the laser beam propagation although the sequential photographs did not reveal any directional change in the optical discharge propagation."
