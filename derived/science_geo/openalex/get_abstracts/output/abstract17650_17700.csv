https://openalex.org/W2165892496,"Steel factor (SF) and LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) synergistically promote the proliferation and survival of mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs), but only for a limited time period in culture. We show here that addition of bFGF to cultures in the presence of membrane-associated SF and LIF enhances the growth of PGCs and allows their continued proliferation beyond the time when they normally stop dividing in vivo. They form colonies of densely packed, alkaline phosphatase-positive, SSEA-1-positive cells resembling undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology. These cultures can be maintained on feeder layers for at least 20 passages, and under appropriate conditions give rise to embryoid bodies and to multiple differentiated cell phenotypes in monolayer culture and in tumors in nude mice. PGC-derived ES cells can also contribute to chimeras when injected into host blastocysts. The long-term culture of PGCs and their reprogramming to pluripotential ES cells has important implications for germ cell biology and the induction of teratocarcinomas."

To create an animal model for cystic fibrosis, mice were generated from embryonic stem cells in which the CFTR gene was disrupted by gene targeting. Mice homozygous for the disrupted gene display many features common to young human cystic fibrosis patients, including failure to thrive, meconium ileus, alteration of mucous and serous glands, and obstruction of glandlike structures with inspissated eosinophilic material. Death resulting from intestinal obstruction usually occurs before 40 days of age."

https://openalex.org/W2044301435,"The immunosuppressant rapamycin inhibited proliferation of the H4IIEC hepatoma cell line. Rapamycin, but not its structural analog FK506, also inhibited the basal and insulin-stimulated activity of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase. By contrast, insulin stimulation of the p85 Rsk S6 kinase and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity were unaffected by drug. Rapamycin treatment of COS cells transfected with recombinant p70 S6 kinase completely inhibited the appearance of the hyperphosphorylated form of p70 S6 kinase concomitant with the inhibition of enzyme activity toward 40S subunits. Thus, rapamycin inhibits a signal transduction element that is necessary for the activation of p70 S6 kinase and mitogenesis but unnecessary for activation of p85 Rsk S6 kinase or MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1506569093,"Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was first identified as a protein that appears on the surface of endothelial cells after exposure to inflammatory cytokines. Through interaction with its integrin counter receptor VLA-4, VCAM-1 mediates cell-cell interactions important for immune function. We have cloned and begun characterization of the promoter for the VCAM-1 gene. In a series of transfection assays into human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we find that silencers between positions -1.641 kilobases and -288 base pairs restrict promoter activity, and that treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha overcomes this inhibition and activates the promoter through two NF kappa B sites located at positions -77 and -63 base pairs of the VCAM-1 gene. This responsiveness appears cell-specific since constructs containing the VCAM-1 NF kappa B sites are not responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha in the T-cell line Jurkat. The two VCAM-1 NF kappa B sites, which differ slightly in their sequence, form distinct complexes in gel retardation assays, suggesting that they interact with different NF kappa B-site binding proteins. The distribution of these proteins could then control activity of the NF kappa B sites. We conclude that the pattern of VCAM-1 expression in HUVECs is controlled by a combination of these silencers and NF kappa B sites."
https://openalex.org/W1596801838,"A20 was first identified as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) primary response transcript encoding a 790-amino acid protein with a unique zinc finger motif. Recently, A20 was shown to protect cells from TNF-induced cytotoxicity in a variety of cell lines. Nuclear run-on studies previously established that TNF activates A20 at the transcriptional level. To further characterize the mechanism by which TNF activates the A20 gene, we have cloned the A20 5'-flanking sequences and identified TNF-responsive elements within the promoter. The transcription initiation site was mapped by both primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments to a position 4.2 kilobases (kb) upstream of the initiator methionine; the first and second exon were separated by a 3.9-kb intron. Sequences upstream of the transcription start site were 76% GC-rich and contained six Sp1 binding sites and a TATA-like sequence at -29 but lacked a consensus CCAAT site. Transfection of Jurkat T-cells with an array of A20 promoter CAT constructs showed that two kappa B elements residing at -54 and -66 were required for induction by TNF. Supporting this notion, DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from unstimulated and TNF-stimulated Jurkat cells demonstrated kappa B-specific binding of a TNF-activated factor to an end-labeled probe containing the two A20 kappa B sequences. Finally, evidence obtained from cotransfection experiments showed that A20 negatively regulated its own expression."

https://openalex.org/W2012747226,"Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is a hereditary skin disorder characterized by blistering and a marked thickening of the stratum corneum. In one family, affected individuals exhibited a mutation in the highly conserved carboxyl terminal of the rod domain of keratin 1. In two other families, affected individuals had mutations in the highly conserved amino terminal of the rod domain of keratin 10. Structural analysis of these mutations predicts that heterodimer formation would be unaffected, although filament assembly and elongation would be severely compromised. These data imply that an intact keratin intermediate filament network is required for the maintenance of both cellular and tissue integrity."

https://openalex.org/W1977188111,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encodes an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-activated chloride channel. In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, loss of CFTR function because of a genetic mutation results in defective cyclic AMP-mediated chloride secretion across epithelia. Because of their potential role as an animal model for CF, mice with targeted disruption of the murine CFTR gene [CFTR(-/-)] were tested for abnormalities in epithelial chloride transport. In both freshly excised tissue from the intestine and in cultured epithelia from the proximal airways, the cyclic AMP-activated chloride secretory response was absent in CFTR(-/-) mice as compared to littermate controls. Thus, disruption of the murine CFTR gene results in the chloride transport abnormalities predicted from studies of human CF epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2073561238,"The DNA sequence of 91.4 kilobases of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome, spanning the region between rrnC at 84.5 minutes and rrnA at 86.5 minutes on the genetic map (85 to 87 percent on the physical map), is described. Analysis of this sequence identified 82 potential coding regions (open reading frames) covering 84 percent of the sequenced interval. The arrangement of these open reading frames, together with the consensus promoter sequences and terminator-like sequences found by computer searches, made it possible to assign them to proposed transcriptional units. More than half the open reading frames correlated with known genes or functions suggested by similarity to other sequences. Those remaining encode still unidentified proteins. The sequenced region also contains several RNA genes and two types of repeated sequence elements were found. Intergenic regions include three ""gray holes,"" 0.6 to 0.8 kilobases, with no recognizable functions."
https://openalex.org/W1510919372,"We investigated the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) in the initiation of signal transduction by nerve growth factor (NGF) in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. PtdIns 3-kinase catalyzes the formation of phosphoinositides with phosphate in the D-3 position of the inositol ring and previously has been found to associate with other activated protein tyrosine kinases, including growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates had PtdIns 3-kinase activity that reached a maximum (9 times the basal activity) after a 5-min exposure of PC12 cells to NGF (100 ng/ml). Since NGF activates the tyrosine kinase activity of gp140trk, the protein product of the trk proto-oncogene, we also examined the association of PtdIns 3-kinase with gp140trk. Anti-gp140trk immunoprecipitates from NGF-stimulated PC12 cells had increased PtdIns 3-kinase activity compared to that of unstimulated cells, and larger increases were detected in cells overexpressing gp140trk, indicating that PtdIns 3-kinase associates with gp140trk. NGF produced large increases in [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in PC12 cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, indicating an increase in PtdIns 3-kinase activity in intact cells. Using an anti-85-kDa PtdIns 3-kinase subunit antibody, we found that NGF promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of an 85-kDa protein and two proteins close to 110 kDa. These studies demonstrate that NGF activates PtdIns 3-kinase and promotes its association with gp140trk and also show that NGF promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85-kDa subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase. Thus, PtdIns 3-kinase activation appears to be involved in differentiation as well as mitogenic responses."

https://openalex.org/W1984049903,"The first cell fate specification process in the Drosophila embryo, formation of the germline precursors, requires posteriorly localized germ plasm. We have cloned a gene, germ cell-less (gcl), required for germline formation. Posterior localization of the gcl messenger RNA (mRNA) requires the function of those genes essential for the localization of both nanos RNA, which specifies the abdomen, and the germ cell determinants. Mothers with reduced gcl function give rise to sterile adult progeny that lack germ cells. In embryos with reduced maternal gcl product, the germ cell precursors fail to form properly. Consistent with this phenotype, gcl protein specifically associates with those nuclei that later become the nuclei of the germ cell precursors. These observations suggest that gcl functions in the germ cell specification pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2058336277,"Charybdotoxin (CTX) blocks high conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels by binding to a receptor site in the externally facing ""mouth."" Toxin bound to the channel can be destabilized from its site by K+ entering the channel from the opposite, internal, solution. By analyzing point mutants of CTX expressed in E. coli, assayed with single Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, we show that a single positively charged residue of the peptide, Lys-27, wholly mediates this interaction of K+ with CTX. If position 27 carries a positively charged residue, internal K+ accelerates the dissociation rate of CTX in a voltage-dependent manner; however, if a neutral Asn or Gln is substituted at this position, the dissociation rate is completely insensitive to either internal K+ or applied voltage. Position 27 is unique in this respect; charge-neutral substitutions made at other positions fail to eliminate the K+ destabilization phenomenon. The results argue that CTX bound to the channel positions Lys-27 physically close to a K(+)-specific binding site on the external end of the conduction pathway and that a K+ ion occupying this site destabilizes CTX via direct electrostatic repulsion with the epsilon-amino group of Lys-27."
https://openalex.org/W1596984507,"Activation of human neutrophils by the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, including a prominent band of approximately 41 kDa. A polypeptide of identical electrophoretic mobility was recognized by a monoclonal antibody raised against a sequence corresponding to amino acids 325-345 of ERK-1, one of a family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. To establish the possible identity of these polypeptides, extracts from control and fMLP-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with immobilized antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Reactivity with anti-ERK-1 antibodies was observed only in the precipitate of chemoattractant-stimulated cells. These data imply that a MAP kinase constitutes at least part of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 41-kDa polypeptide. By using an in vitro renaturation assay, treatment of intact cells with fMLP was found to stimulate several protein kinases, including one of approximately 41 kDa. Renaturation of samples immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed the presence of an active protein kinase in chemoattractant-stimulated, but not in control cells. The immunoprecipitated kinase comigrated with the 41-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated polypeptide and the anti-ERK-1 reactive band. We conclude that a MAP kinase closely related or identical to ERK-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated when human neutrophils are stimulated by chemotactic peptides. The rapid phosphorylation of this kinase, which is apparent within seconds, is compatible with a role in the activation of the respiratory burst and/or other neutrophil responses."
https://openalex.org/W1573935872,"We have produced antibodies specific for the three P-glycoprotein (P-gp) isoforms encoded by the mouse mdr1, mdr2, and mdr3 genes. The anti-Mdr2 and anti-Mdr3 antibodies were generated against synthetic peptides derived from the linker region, whereas the anti-Mdr1 antibody was raised against a fusion protein containing the amino terminus of Mdr1. Western blot analysis showed that the three antibodies could discriminate between the three isoforms in membrane fractions from Hamster cells transfected with the corresponding full-length or chimeric mdr cDNAs. Immunocytochemistry studies of mdr-transfected cells showed that the three antibodies specifically recognized each P-gp isoform expressed in whole cells. Immunoblotting of normal mouse tissues revealed that the Mdr2 isoform was expressed at very high levels in liver canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV) but not in membrane vesicles prepared from the basolateral (sinusoidal) domain (SMV). Mdr3 was detected in intestinal brush border membrane vesicles and also in CMV, although at levels much lower than Mdr2. Mdr1 was not detected in CMV or SMV but was detected in endometrial tissue from the gravid uterus. Photolabeling experiments with [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin followed by immunoprecipitation with isoform-specific antibodies indicated that, in CMV, Mdr3 but not Mdr2 could bind the drug analogue."
https://openalex.org/W1548908535,"Steel factor (SF) (also called stem cell factor, mast cell growth factor, or c-kit ligand) is a recently cloned hemopoietic growth factor that is produced by bone marrow stromal cells, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes. In both mouse and man it acts synergistically with several colony stimulating factors, including interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), to induce the proliferation and differentiation of primitive hemopoietic precursor cells. In order to study its mechanism of action and to explore the molecular basis for its synergistic activity we have examined the proteins that become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to SF, IL-3, and GM-CSF. We report herein that SF, but not IL-3 or GM-CSF, dramatically stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the product of the recently discovered proto-oncogene, vav, in two SF-responsive human cell lines, M07E and TF-1. Although phosphorylation is very rapid, reaching maximal levels within 2 min at 37 degrees C, co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that c-kit may either not associate directly with p95vav or bind to it with very low affinity. Nonetheless, our data suggest that c-kit may utilize p95vav to mediate downstream signaling in hemopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562203178,"A number of mammalian cell surface proteins are anchored by glycoinositol phospholipid (GPI) structures that are preassembled and transferred to them in the endoplasmic reticulum. The GPIs in these proteins contain linear ethanolamine (EthN)-phosphate (P)-6ManManManGlcN core glycan sequences bearing an additional EthN-P attached to the Man residue (Man 1) proximal to GlcN. The biochemical precursors of mammalian GPI anchor structures are incompletely characterized. In this study, putative [3H]Man-labeled GPI precursors were obtained by in vitro GDP-[3H] Man labeling of HeLa cell microsomes and by in vivo [3H]Man labeling of class B and F Thy-1 negative murine lymphoma mutants known to accumulate incomplete GPIs. The high performance liquid chromatography-purified in vitro and accumulated in vivo GPI products were structurally analyzed by nitrous acid deamination, hydrofluoric acid, trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis, biosynthetic labeling, and exoglycosidase treatment. The data were consistent with a biosynthetic scheme in which Man and EthN-P are added stepwise to the developing glycan. Several additional points were demonstrated: 1) putative mammalian GPI precursors contain incomplete core glycans corresponding to those in previously characterized trypanosome GPI precursors. 2) The proximal EthN-P found in mature mammalian GPI anchor structures is added to Man 1 prior to incorporation of Man 2 and Man 3. 3) Glycans in the incomplete GPIs that accumulate in classes B and F lymphoma mutants consist of Man2- and Man3GlcN in which EthN-P is linked to Man 1. 4) Distal EthN-P linked to the 6-position of Man, characteristic of the complete GPI core, is found both in a subsequent GPI species with the glycan sequence EthN-P-6ManMan(EthN-P----)ManGlcN and in a more polar GPI product."
https://openalex.org/W1603904020,"To explore the role of transcriptional factors in the genesis of the senescent phenotype, nuclear extracts from 4- and 30-month-old rat brains were analyzed for the presence of DNA-binding proteins able to interact with double-stranded oligonucleotides containing recognition sites for sequence-specific DNA-binding factors. Gel shift assays revealed that the DNA-binding efficiency of Sp1 is significantly reduced in aged animals compared to young ones, whereas CTF/NF1 and AP1 from young and old rat nuclear extracts bind their DNA targets with the same efficiency. The quantitative analysis of Sp1 by immunoblotting indicated that equivalent quantities and degrees of heterogeneity of Sp1 protein are present in both nuclear extracts, suggesting that the observed difference is not due to a different expression of this transcriptional factor. DNase I footprinting of the heavy chain ferritin gene promoter, which contains a Sp1 binding site, demonstrated that the nuclear extract from 30-month-old rat brain does not protect the region involved in the regulation of the H ferritin gene by Sp1. This results in a reduction of about 50% of the expression of the H ferritin mRNA in aged rat brains. Furthermore, the Sp1 binding sites present in the SV40 early promoter are not protected in a DNase I footprinting assay where a nuclear extract from 30-month-old rat brain was used as a source of DNA binding proteins. Liver nuclear extracts prepared from young and aged rats demonstrated that a decrease of Sp1 binding efficiency is similarly present in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1537062554,"The major cytosolic substrate of the insulin receptor is a 185-kDa phosphoprotein (IRS-1) that contains multiple putative attachment sites for the p85 alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K). To examine the possible interaction of pp185 with p85 alpha in vivo, we injected insulin or insulinomimetic agents (a combination of H2O2 and vanadate (H/V)) into the portal vein of anesthetized rats. IN this model system, H/V treatment and, to a lesser extent, injection of insulin resulted in rapid and sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins, including pp185/IRS-1. The latter was found to undergo specific association with the p85 alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K but not with two other proteins that contain src homology domains. As p85 alpha was not detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and did not appear to interact directly with the insulin receptor, we conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185 promotes its association with p85 alpha and the catalytic subunit of PI3K. The recruitment of the holoenzyme may also involve its enzymatic activation and thus constitute an important step in the transduction of insulin signals."
https://openalex.org/W1591392705,"A substance P (SP) analog, [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,10] SP4-11, is known to inhibit the actions of various structurally unrelated messenger molecules as well as SP. Our studies on the effects of this peptide on the regulation of purified G proteins by receptor showed that at least some of the biological effects of the peptide can be explained by the ability of the peptide to block the activation of G proteins by receptors. Here we report that a novel truncated SP-related peptide, pGlu-Gln-D-Trp-Phe-D-Trp-D-Trp-Met-NH2, inhibited the activation of G(i) or G(o) by M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M2 mAChR) or of Gs by beta-adrenergic receptor in the reconstituted phospholipid vesicles, assayed by receptor-promoted GTP hydrolysis. The inhibition by the peptide was apparently reversible and competitive with respect to receptor binding to G proteins; the inhibition could be overcome by increasing the concentration of receptor in the vesicles and was not altered by changes in the concentration of G protein. The competing effects of the peptide were used to analyze the effect of agonist on receptor-G protein interaction. The concentration change of muscarinic agonist did not alter the inhibitory effects of the peptide on M2 mAChR-promoted GTPase by G(o), which is consistent with the idea that agonist increases the regulatory efficiency of the receptor but does not alter its affinity for G proteins. This new group of compounds (G protein antagonists) is a promising tool to study receptor-G protein interaction quantitatively."
https://openalex.org/W1596211697,"Thrombospondin (TSP) is a multifunctional matrix and platelet glycoprotein that interacts with cell surfaces and may play a role in mediating cell adhesion, platelet aggregation, platelet-monocyte interactions, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, and protease generation. To clarify and confirm the function of CD36 (glycoprotein IV) as a TSP receptor, we now describe a transfected cell model using human melanoma cells genetically manipulated by sense or antisense cDNA transfection to express either high or near zero levels of CD36. Surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG and quantified by measuring radiolabeled antibody binding. Bowes melanoma cells, which in their wild type did not express CD36 and did not bind radiolabeled TSP, when transfected with the sense construct bound TSP in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with CD36 expression. Conversely, C32 melanoma cells, which in their wild type expressed high levels of CD36 and bound radiolabeled TSP at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, did not express CD36 and did not bind TSP when transfected with an antisense construct. In addition, transfected Bowes cells and wild type C32 cells, unlike wild type Bowes cells, adhered to activated platelets in a TSP-dependent manner. These data, i.e. the gain of function with sense cDNA transfection and loss of function with antisense transfection, strongly support the TSP receptor function of CD36. The distribution of this protein in vascular cells and tissues and observations that it may participate in signal transduction events suggest that TSP-CD36 interactions may play a role in mediating some of the pathophysiological processes associated with TSP."
https://openalex.org/W1603613420,"Fifty human livers obtained at autopsy were analyzed for N-acetyltransferase and classified into six genotypes. Determination of N-acetyltransferase activity and proteins from supernatants of liver homogenates indicate that genotype I corresponds to rapid acetylator, genotypes II and III to intermediate acetylator, and genotypes IV, V, and VI to slow acetylator phenotypes. Northern blot analysis shows that levels of mRNA for N-acetyltransferase in the livers do not markedly differ among the six genotypes. Three alleles of the N-acetyltransferase gene were cloned and sequenced. mRNA is coded in two exons. Comparison of alleles 2 and 3, which correspond to low N-acetyltransferase activity, with allele 1, which corresponds to high N-acetyltransferase activity, revealed several polymorphisms. Two gene sequence differences occur in the coding exons of alleles 2 and 3, one of which would produce different amino acids in the proteins. Those sequence differences that lead to amino acid substitutions result in a loss of BamHI and TaqI sites for alleles 2 and 3, respectively. Expression studies of the alleles in Chinese hamster ovary cells show that allele 1 expresses high levels of N-acetyltransferase activity and enzyme protein, while alleles 2 and 3 express low levels of both protein and activity."
https://openalex.org/W1615018161,"A manifestation of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid depositions in brains of afflicted individuals. A major component of these depositions is the amyloid beta-protein, which is a truncated form of the larger amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP). To investigate the regulation of APP gene expression, the APP promoter and selected deletions were placed 5‘ to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The promoter deletions were transfected into different cell lines that showed variant levels of endogenous APP transcripts. Transient transfection assays showed that 96 base pairs 5‘ to the transcriptional start site are sufficient for cell type-specific promoter activity. A nuclear factor that binds to this region in a sequence-specific manner was identified by mobility shift electrophoresis, DNase footprinting, and methylation interference. The DNase-protected region covers about 25 base pairs on both strands (position -31 to -55). Mutations within this domain revealed a sequence of 12 base pairs that is crucial for factor binding. This sequence overlaps with the consensus sequences for transcription factors AP-1 and AP-4. However, competition experiments suggest that the nuclear factor that binds to the APP promoter is distinct from both AP-1 and AP-4. Factor binding to the characterized recognition sequence is observed in nuclear extracts originating from human, mouse, and rat cells, suggesting a high degree of conservation."
https://openalex.org/W1579384030,"Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily which interacts with the integrin very late antigen-4 (VLA4). The VCAM1/VLA4 interaction mediates both adhesion and signal transduction and is thought to play an important role in inflammatory and immune responses in vivo. The major form of human VCAM1 contains seven extracellular Ig-like domains, with domain 1 designated as the most N-terminal. We have examined the relationship between human VCAM1 structure and function using a combination of domain truncation mutants and proteolytic fragmentation of recombinant soluble VCAM1. We have characterized two regions of VCAM1, localized to domains 4 and 5, which are highly sensitive to proteolytic cleavage, localized the epitope of the blocking monoclonal antibody 4B9 to domain 1, and found that domains 1-3 are sufficient for both its adhesive function and its ability to initiate T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2009423919,"The peptide binding cleft of the class I human histocompatibility antigen, HLA-A2, contains conserved amino acid residues clustered in the two ends of the cleft in pockets A and F as well as polymorphic residues. The function of two conserved tyrosines in the A pocket was investigated by mutating them to phenylalanines and of a conserved tyrosine and threonine in the F pocket by mutating them to phenylalanine and valine, respectively. Presentation of influenza virus peptides and of intact virus to cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was then examined. The magnitude of the reduction seen by the mutation of the two tyrosines in the A pocket suggests that hydrogen bonds involving them have a critical function in the binding of the NH2-terminal NH3+ of the peptide nonamer and possibly of all bound peptide nonamers. In contrast, the mutations in the F pocket had no effect on CTL recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1606425685,"Functional expression of recombinant wild-type phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit has been unsuccessful in the past. A nine-amino-acid peptide sequence (YP-YDVPDYA) derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein was used to modify the NH2 and/or COOH terminus of the phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit. Addition of the nine-amino-acid sequence at the NH2 terminus allowed recombinant phosphatase 2A expression as a predominantly cytosolic phosphatase 2A enzyme. The 12CA5 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the nine-amino-acid hemagglutinin peptide sequence was used to immunoprecipitate the epitope-tagged phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit. Assay of the immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged phosphatase 2A demonstrated an okadaic acid-sensitive dephosphorylation of [32P] histone H1 and [32P]myelin basic protein similar to that measured with the wild-type enzyme. Functional phosphatase activity could be demonstrated for the NH2-terminal modified phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit following transient expression in COS cells or stable expression in Rat1a cells. In contrast, the COOH-terminal-modified phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit was very poorly expressed. The NH2-, COOH-modified subunit, having the nine-amino-acid hemagglutinin peptide sequence encoded at both termini of the polypeptide, was also expressed as a functional phosphatase 2A enzyme. Thus, NH2-terminal modification of the phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit results in a functional plasmid-expressed enzyme. The unique nine-amino-acid epitope-tag sequence also provides a method to easily resolve the recombinant phosphatase 2A from the endogenous wild-type gene product and related phosphatases expressed in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2083951231,"A chloride (Cl-)-dependent, nonselective cation conductance was activated during cellular shrinkage and inhibited during cellular swelling or by extracellular gadolinium. The shrinking-induced, nonselective cation conductance and the swelling-induced anion conductance appear to function in the regulation of cell volume in airway epithelia. The shrinking-induced cation conductance had an unusual dependence on Cl-: partial replacement of extracellular Cl- with aspartate reduced the magnitude of the shrinking-enhanced current without accompanying changes in the reversal potential. The Cl- dependence of the nonselective cation conductance could provide a mechanism that tightly regulates Cl- secretion and sodium reabsorption in cells under osmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1571791641,"The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP; 476 amino acids) mediates the transfer of neutral lipids and phospholipids between plasma lipoproteins. Previous studies showed that the epitope of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (TP2) was located within the C-terminal 26 amino acids (aa) of CETP. To determine possible involvement of this region in lipid transfer activities, we generated six deletion mutants between Arg-451 and Leu-475 by in vitro mutagenesis and expressed mutant proteins in mammalian cells. Only deletion mutants between aa Phe-463 and Leu-475 failed to bind TP2; these mutant proteins were well secreted by cells but showed markedly reduced cholesteryl ester transfer activity. One of the deletion mutants (delta 470-475) showed similar reductions in cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer activities but normal or increased phospholipid transfer activity. Limited proteolysis of this mutant protein indicated a similar overall folding pattern to the wild-type protein. Thus, aa between Phe-463 and Leu-475 are necessary for binding TP2. Deletions within this sequence selectively impair neutral lipid transfer activity, suggesting a direct involvement in neutral lipid transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2079101029,"Here we describe three novel reactions of the self-splicing group II intron bl1 (the first intron of the COB gene of yeast mitochondria) demonstrating its catalytic versatility: reversal of the first step of the self-splicing reaction catalyzed by a linear form of the intron utilizing the energy of a phosphoanhydride bond for transesterification, ligation of a single-stranded DNA to an RNA, and cleavage of a single-stranded DNA substrate. These results have the following evolutionary implications: use of the α-β bond of a terminal triphosphate for transesterification suggests that an RNA RNA replicase could use mononucleotide triphosphates as precursors, and cleavage of single-stranded DNA and DNA-RNA ligation suggests that excised group II introns might integrate directly into DNA without prior reverse transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1592445147,"CD34 is a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein expressed by early hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as endothelial cells. Previously we found that CD34 is rapidly and stoichiometrically phosphorylated by activated protein kinase C (PKC) (Fackler, M.J., Civin, C.I., Sutherland, D.R., Baker, M.A., and May, W.S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11056-11061). In the present study, we find dose-dependent up-regulation of CD34 surface expression following treatment of normal human CD34+ bone marrow progenitor cells, cord blood-derived KMT-2, or KG1 a myeloid leukemia cells with the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Up-regulation begins within 1 min of treatment, is maximal by 30 min, is maintained for at least 3 h, and is associated with CD34 hyperphosphorylation. A specific inhibitor of PKC, 2,6-diamino-N-(1[1-(1-oxotridecyl)-2-piperadinyl]methyl)h exan-amide (NPC 15437), blocks both up-regulation and hyperphosphorylation of CD34. CD34 up-regulation is independent of transcription and/or translation and results from the recruitment of preformed intracellular CD34. The endocytosis rate of surface CD34 is unaltered by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Thus, activation of PKC mediates increased surface expression of the CD34 molecule possibly as a result of phosphorylation of CD34."
https://openalex.org/W1990184096,"The goldfish visual pathway displays a remarkable capacity for continued development and plasticity. The intermediate filament proteins in this pathway are unexpected and atypical, suggesting these proteins provide a structure that supports growth and plasticity. Using a goldfish retina λgt10 library, we have isolated a full-length cDNA clone that encodes a novel type III intermediate filament protein. The mRNA for this protein is located in retinal ganglion cells, and its level dramatically increases during optic nerve regeneration. The protein is transported into the optic nerve within the slow phase of axonal transport. We have named this protein plasticin because it was isolated from a neuronal pathway well known for its plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1505872974,"POU proteins are a class of homeobox-containing transcription factors that regulate tissue-specific gene expression and influence cell differentiation and function. We have investigated the possible role of such factors in mediating the actions of nerve growth factor (NGF) on sensory neurons. NGF has been found to have differential effects on the levels of three POU protein transcription factors that are expressed in adult rat sensory neurons. A sensory neuron octamer-binding protein with the properties of the transcription factor Oct-2 is up-regulated 3-4-fold by NGF, as measured by mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons grown in the presence or absence of NGF. Quantitation of Oct-2 mRNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA from such cells shows a parallel increase in Oct-2 mRNA levels. In contrast, the levels of mRNA encoding the ubiquitous POU protein Oct-1 or the neuron-specific POU protein Brn-3, also present in sensory neurons, are unaffected by NGF. These observations suggest a role for Oct-2 in mediating transcriptional effects induced by NGF. In particular, as Oct-2 is known to inhibit herpes simplex virus immediate-early gene expression in neuronal cells, these findings provide a mechanism for the known action of NGF in the maintenance of latent herpes virus infections in sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1591328192,"We used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the minimum number of PDGF B residues needed to convert PDGF A to a potently transforming PDGF B-like molecule. Substitution of two PDGF B subdomains, 106-115 and 135-144, were found to be critical. These substitutions were sufficient to broaden the ability of PDGF A to activate beta as well as alpha platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and increase its transforming efficiency to that of PDGF B. Within subdomain I, either PDGF B residues Arg-109 and Asn-115 or Arg-109, Leu-110, and Arg-113, in combination with subdomain II PDGF B residues Asn-136, Arg-137, and Arg-142 were identified as being essential. Those mutants with transforming ability comparable with PDGF B showed significantly lower efficiencies of beta receptor triggering. Thus, our studies identify a small number of PDGF B amino acids indispensable for beta PDGF receptor interaction and suggest that a low level of beta PDGF receptor activation is sufficient to dramatically increase PDGF transforming efficiency in NIH 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507384356,"It has been proposed that the acute desensitization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) function can be accounted for, in part, by the effect of EGF to increase phosphorylation of the receptor at Ser1046/7 (Countaway, J.L., Nairn, A.C., and Davis, R.J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1129-1140). Here, we show that the mutational removal of this phosphorylation site causes an activation of EGF-R function and a potentiation of signal transduction. The mechanism of potentiation results from 1) defective down-regulation of the EGF-R when cells are incubated with high concentrations of EGF; and 2) increased EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. The increased EGF-stimulated phosphorylation is associated with an alteration of the apparent specificity of tyrosine phosphorylation and is independent of the down-regulation defect. Together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that Ser1046/7 is a biologically significant site of regulatory phosphorylation of the EGF-R."
https://openalex.org/W1552940397,Membrane transport pathways for transplacental transfer of the water-soluble vitamin biotin were investigated by assessing the possible presence of a Na(+)-biotin cotransport mechanism in the maternal-facing membrane of human placental epithelial cells. The presence of Na(+)-biotin cotransport was determined from radiolabeled tracer flux measurements of biotin uptake using preparations of purified brush-border membrane vesicles. The imposition of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient stimulated vesicle uptake of biotin to levels approximately 25-fold greater than those observed at equilibrium. The voltage sensitivity of Na+ gradient-driven biotin uptake suggested Na(+)-biotin cotransport is electrogenic occurring with net transfer of positive charge. A kinetic analysis of the activation of biotin uptake by increasing Na+ was most consistent with an interaction of Na+ at 2 sites in the transport protein. Static head determinations used to identify the magnitude of opposing driving forces bringing flux through the cotransport mechanism to equilibrium indicated a coupling ratio of 2 Na+ per biotin. Substrate specificity studies using chemical analogues of biotin suggested both the terminal carboxylic acid of the valeric acid side chain and a second nucleus of anionic charge were important determinants for substrate interaction with the cotransport protein. Initial rate determinations of biotin uptake indicate biotin interacts with a single saturable site (Km = 21 microM) with a maximal transport rate of 4.5 nmol/mg/min. The results of this study provide evidence for an electrogenic Na(+)-biotin cotransport mechanism in the maternal-facing membrane of human placental epithelial cells.
https://openalex.org/W1556150318,"Epithelial cells utilize at least two types of apical Cl- channels, the cAMP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent Cl- channel. While phorbal ester (PMA) activates only CFTR-dependent Cl- secretion and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 only the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent Cl- secretion, PMA and A23187 share the ability to down-regulate expression of the CFTR gene at the transcriptional level. Since both PMA and A23187 can activate protein kinases, we hypothesized that protein kinase pathways may be involved in the regulation of CFTR gene expression. Exposure of HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells to the protein kinase C activator SC9 down-regulated CFTR mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion, similar to that seen with PMA. The reduction in CFTR transcript levels by SC9 and PMA was blocked by H7, an inhibitor of protein kinases. In a similar fashion, the down-regulation of CFTR transcript levels by A23187 was blocked by H7 as well as staurosporine, another protein kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, both H7 and staurosporine themselves increased CFTR mRNA levels. Quantification of CFTR gene transcription rate showed a reduction by SC9 (similar to that with PMA and A23187) that was prevented by H7 and that H7 by itself increased CFTR transcription. Together, these observations suggest that protein kinase pathways, likely including protein kinase C, are involved in the regulation of CFTR gene expression, with activation or inhibition of protein kinase activity down-regulating or up-regulating CFTR gene expression, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1483202585,"The ability of the cloned liver growth hormone (GH) receptor, when expressed in mammalian cell lines, to copurify with tyrosine kinase activity and be tyrosyl phosphorylated was examined. 125I-human growth hormone-GH receptor complexes isolated from COS-7 cells transiently expressing high levels of the cloned liver GH receptor bound to anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, suggesting that the cloned GH receptor is tyrosyl phosphorylated in vivo. GH-GH receptor complexes purified from transfected COS-7 cells using anti-GH antibody incorporated 32P when incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, indicating association of tyrosine kinase activity with cloned liver GH receptor. The level of phosphorylation of the GH receptor was very low, as compared with the endogenous GH receptor in 3T3-F442A cells, suggesting that tyrosine kinase activity is not intrinsic to the cloned GH receptor but rather resides with a kinase present at low levels in the COS-7 cells. To test whether a higher level of GH receptor phosphorylation would be observed when the GH receptor was expressed in a different cell line, GH receptor cDNAs were stably transfected into mouse L and CHO cells, which have few or no endogenous GH receptors, and RIN5-AH cells, which do express endogenous GH receptors. In vivo tyrosyl phosphorylation of the cloned GH receptor in mouse L cells and in vitro phosphorylation of the cloned GH receptor in both L and CHO cells were higher than in transfected COS-7 cells but still substantially lower than in untransfected 3T3-F442A cells. Significantly increased 32P incorporation into tyrosyl residues in GH receptors in the in vitro kinase assay was demonstrated for GH receptors isolated from the transfected RIN5-AH cells. These studies show that the cloned liver GH receptor can be tyrosyl phosphorylated when expressed in a variety of cell types. The finding that the level of phosphorylation of GH receptor appears to vary with cell type is consistent with the cloned liver GH receptor being a substrate for an associated tyrosine kinase and with the amount of such a GH receptor-associated tyrosine kinase being cell type-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1518947132,"The properties of the recognition sites for alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor; low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) and beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) (remnant receptor) on rat parenchymal cells were directly compared to analyze whether both substrates are recognized and internalized by the same receptor system. In cholesterol-fed rats, the large circulating pool of beta-VLDL is unable to diminish the liver uptake of 125I-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin, while liver uptake of 125I-labeled beta-VLDL in these rats is reduced by 87.3% at 10 min after injection. In vitro competition studies with isolated parenchymal liver cells demonstrate that the binding of 125I-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin to rat parenchymal cells is not effectively competed for by beta-VLDL, whether this lipoprotein is additionally enriched in apolipoprotein E or not. Binding of alpha 2-macroglobulin to parenchymal cells requires the presence of calcium, while binding of beta-VLDL does not. Incubation of parenchymal cells for 1 h with proteinase K reduced the subsequent binding of alpha 2-macroglobulin by 90.1%, while the binding of beta-VLDL was reduced by only 20.2%. In the presence of monensin, the association of alpha 2-macroglobulin to parenchymal cells at 2 h of incubation was reduced by 64.7%, while the association of beta-VLDL was not affected. Preincubation of parenchymal cells with monensin for 60 min at 37 degrees C reduced the subsequent binding of alpha 2-macroglobulin by 54.5%, while binding of beta-VLDL was only reduced by 14.6%. The results indicate that the recognition sites for alpha 2-macroglobulin and beta-VLDL on rat parenchymal cells do exert different properties and are therefore likely to reside on different molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1533755840,Vinculin and talin are major adhesion plaque components which interact in vitro and presumably in vivo. The amino acid sequence of talin is now known so details of its domain structure can be mapped. We localized vinculin binding sites in the talin sequence by overlaying peptide maps of talin with an anti-idiotypic vinculin antibody that recognizes talin and with 125I-vinculin. A rabbit injected only twice with vinculin and producing anti-vinculin antibodies spontaneously generated a second antibody that recognizes talin. Vinculin and anti-vinculin antibodies specifically compete with this second antibody for binding to talin as determined by solid-phase binding and overlay assays. The antibody is thus most likely an anti-idiotypic antibody which mimics a region of vinculin that interacts with talin. The binding site of the anti-idiotypic antibody on talin was mapped to the 196 amino acids spanning residues 1653 to 1848. A second vinculin binding site identified with an 125I-vinculin blot overlay technique was located between residues 483 and 1652. The observation that talin has two immunologically distinct vinculin binding sites suggests that vinculin may have two different talin binding sites or one complex site with two interacting regions.
https://openalex.org/W1514435967,"Following treatment of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with dimethyl sulfoxide and other typical erythroid inducing agents, the profile of cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was drastically altered. We found that the level of almost all of the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was either decreased or disappeared at a very early stage of differentiation. Addition of sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), a specific inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases, prevented the alteration as well as erythroid differentiation. Mutant MEL cells, which are resistant to differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide, were apparently insensitive to the alteration. These results indicate that dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues in cellular proteins is coupled with a reaction(s) which is responsible for triggering differentiation of MEL cells."

https://openalex.org/W1570465948,"CD7 is a 40-kDa cell surface glycoprotein expressed on T-cell precursors before their entry into the thymus during fetal development and whose functional role remains uncertain. T-cell activation has been shown to increase the expression of this surface molecule. In this report we describe the intracellular signals and the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CD7 antigen expression on human T lymphocytes. The elevation of intracellular calcium by using the A23187 ionophore increased the cell surface expression of CD7, whereas protein kinase C activation caused its down-regulation. Interestingly, the increase of intracellular cAMP with Bt2cAMP stimulated CD7 expression as well. Upregulation of CD7 on the cell surface following either Bt2cAMP or calcium ionophore stimulation of T lymphocytes correlated with a raise of the steady-state levels of CD7-specific mRNA, without de novo protein synthesis requirements. No differences between the half-life of basal CD7 mRNA and that induced by either Bt2cAMP or calcium ionophore were detected. Run-on experiments showed that both stimuli enhanced the transcriptional rate of the CD7 gene. Our results provide the evidence for a positive regulatory effect mediated by cAMP on the expression of a leucocyte differentiation antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1574512908,"Despite the presumed importance of desmoglein, a 160-kDa glycoprotein, in desmosome formation and its possible involvement in certain blistering skin diseases, the precise location and function of this protein have not yet been firmly established. We describe here the characterization of a new monoclonal antibody, AE23, against an extracellular epitope of desmoglein. Both the AE23 epitope and another epitope, defined by the previously characterized DG3.4 antibody, reside on a 160-kDa human epidermal desmoglein as evidenced by their identical solubility profile, their coexistence in a 130-kDa desmoglein degradative product, their coadsorption by an AE23 immunoaffinity column, and the identical changes in the two antigens' electrophoretic mobility after air oxidation and deglycosylation. The AE23 epitope is resistant to various endoglycosidases, suggesting that sugar moieties are not involved. Characterization of several proteolytic fragments of this epidermal desmoglein enabled us to map the DG3.4 epitope to a 96-kDa intracellular domain and the AE23 epitope to an extracellular domain flanked by the plasma membrane and the distal N-glycosylation site(s). However, these two epitopes do not always coexist on the same desmoglein molecule. For example, tissue surveys showed that although the DG3.4 epitope is present in the desmogleins of all epithelial cell types, the AE23 epitope is limited to normal keratinocytes. Moreover, electron microscopic localization data indicate that whereas the DG3.4 epitope is detected in the submembranous plaques of desmosomes, the AE23 epitope is present in the intercellular space of both desmosomal and nondesmosomal areas. These results raise the possibility that there exist several biochemically closely related isoforms of desmoglein, one (AE23+/DG3.4+) restricted to epidermal desmosomes, one (AE23+/DG3.4-) uniformly distributed along the keratinocyte cell surface, and another (AE23-/DG3.4+) present in desmosomes of simple epithelia and basal cells of cultured keratinocytes. The uniform distribution of at least one desmoglein-related antigen in the intercellular space of keratinocytes coupled with the realization that different isoforms of desmogleins form a subfamily of cadherins suggest that desmoglein(s) may play a more general role in keratinocyte adhesion than previously appreciated."
