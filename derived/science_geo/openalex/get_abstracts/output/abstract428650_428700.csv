https://openalex.org/W1985738709,"A State of High T c Superconductivity There are strong indications that high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates is formed amid competing orders, but only two have been observed unambiguously. The so-called stripe order has been observed in a Lanthanum-based cuprate family and consists of coexisting charge-and-spin modulations and occurs at a characteristic dopant concentration in which the critical temperature T c has a dip. Now, Ghiringhelli et al. (p. 821 , published online 12 July; see the Perspective by Tranquada ) have used resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to uncover a related but apparently two-dimensional charge order in the much cleaner YBCO cuprate family. The charge fluctuations were not commensurate with the lattice and did not originate in the characteristic oxygen chains of YBCO. The order appeared only in a narrow interval of dopant concentrations and competed with superconductivity, which provides a natural explanation for a plateau in T c observed in the same range."
https://openalex.org/W2039399096,"GPCR Close-Up Structures of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) determined in the past few years, have provided insight into the function of this important family of membrane proteins. Liu et al. (p. 232 ) used a protein-engineering strategy to produce a stabilized version of the human A 2A adenosine receptor (A 2A AR). The high-resolution structure reveals the position of about 60 internal waters, which suggests an almost continuous channel in the GPCR and can explain the allosteric effects of Na + on ligand binding and how cholesterol may contribute to GPCR stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2012012446,"Optical maps of a genome, which are generated by imaging labeled single molecules of DNA, facilitate structural variation analysis and sequence assembly. Lam et al. immobilize DNA molecules in nanoscale channels, increasing the accuracy and throughput of the mapping process. We describe genome mapping on nanochannel arrays. In this approach, specific sequence motifs in single DNA molecules are fluorescently labeled, and the DNA molecules are uniformly stretched in thousands of silicon channels on a nanofluidic device. Fluorescence imaging allows the construction of maps of the physical distances between occurrences of the sequence motifs. We demonstrate the analysis, individually and as mixtures, of 95 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that cover the 4.7-Mb human major histocompatibility complex region. We obtain accurate, haplotype-resolved, sequence motif maps hundreds of kilobases in length, resulting in a median coverage of 114× for the BACs. The final sequence motif map assembly contains three contigs. With an average distance of 9 kb between labels, we detect 22 haplotype differences. We also use the sequence motif maps to provide scaffolds for de novo assembly of sequencing data. Nanochannel genome mapping should facilitate de novo assembly of sequencing reads from complex regions in diploid organisms, haplotype and structural variation analysis and comparative genomics."

Alexander et al. (p. 721 , published online 12 July) estimated the hydrogen isotopic compositions in 86 samples of primitive meteorites that fell in Antarctica and compared the results to those of comets and Saturn's moon, Enceladus. Water in primitive meteorites was less deuteriumrich than that in comets and Enceladus, implying that, in contradiction to recent models of the dynamical evolution of the solar system, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites cannot have formed in the same region as comets. The results also suggest that comets were not the principal source of Earth's water."
https://openalex.org/W1994155113,"More Melting The last interglacial period, around 125,000 years ago, was 1° to 2°C warmer than the present, and the sea level was thought to be 4 to 6 meters higher. However, Dutton and Lambeck (p. 216 ), now suggest that sea level was possibly as much as 10 meters above current levels. Such a large excess of seawater would mean that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melted much more than previously assumed, which has implications for how much sea-level rise we should expect with anthropogenic climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2069742753,"Modulating the Clock Because of the close association of the circadian clock with a wide range of physiological processes, identification of clock-modulating small molecules may prove useful for the treatment of circadian-related disorders, which include circadian sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and metabolic disease. Hirota et al. (p. 1094 , published online 12 July) screened for chemical compounds that affected the period of the circadian clock in a human osteosarcoma cell line. A carbazole derivative named KL001 appeared to act by inhibiting proteolytic degradation of the cryptochrome proteins, which in turn caused a lengthening of the circadian period. KL001 also inhibited glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis in primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes."

We developed an in vivo labeling strategy to allow the extracellular matrix of developing biofilms to be visualized with conventional and superresolution light microscopy. Vibrio cholerae biofilms displayed three distinct levels of spatial organization: cells, clusters of cells, and collections of clusters. Multiresolution imaging of living V. cholerae biofilms revealed the complementary architectural roles of the four essential matrix constituents: RbmA provided cell-cell adhesion; Bap1 allowed the developing biofilm to adhere to surfaces; and heterogeneous mixtures of Vibrio polysaccharide, RbmC, and Bap1 formed dynamic, flexible, and ordered envelopes that encased the cell clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2037788803,"Moving Dislocations The mechanical properties of crystalline materials are limited by the presence and motion of defects caused by extra or missing atoms in the crystal lattice. Plastic deformation of a material causes these defects, known as dislocations, to move and multiply. Much is known about the motion of dislocations in three dimensions but less so in two. Warner et al. (p. 209 ; see the Perspective by Bonilla and Carpio ) used graphene as a model material to track dislocation dynamics in real time. The strain fields in the graphene sheet were mapped, which suggests that the dislocation motion is connected to the stretching, rotating, and breaking of individual carbon bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2084028745,"Spin-Dependent Light Emission Spintronic devices exploit electronic currents that are spin polarized, which have an excess of one spin current over the other. One way to detect this polarization would be to create a light-emitting diode that is sensitive to spin polarization. Along these lines, Nguyen et al. (p. 204 ) constructed a bipolar device in which an organic semiconductor was sandwiched between two ferromagnetic contacts whose relative polarization could be controlled by an applied magnetic field. Magneto-electroluminescence of the order of ∼1% was observed at a bias voltage of ∼3.5 V. The use of a deuterated organic polymer interlayer improved spin transport relative to polymers with hydrogen side groups, and a thin LiF buffer layer on the ferromagnetic cathode improved electron injection efficiency."

(p. 228 ; see the Perspective by Rangel ) describe a mathematical approach for predicting the time lags in extinction following habitat loss. The model was applied to the highly biodiverse Brazilian Amazon region, and used to reconstruct the spatial and temporal patterns of extinction and the accumulation of extinction debt from 1970 through to the present, and to extrapolate to 2050 under four deforestation scenarios. The Amazon basin sits at a critical point: Few species have been driven extinct to date, but an extinction debt is rapidly accumulating, which could lead to an increasing rate of extinction in the next four decades."

https://openalex.org/W2093011718,"The mucosa of the large intestine mucosa is an effective vaccination site for induction of protective mucosal immunity against rectal or vaginal viral infection but clinically is impractical. Here Qing Zhu et al. have developed an oral delivery system that encapsulates vaccine into pH-dependent poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with Eudragit to protect against the low pH and enzymatic destruction of the stomach. This approach was shown to selectively target the large intestine in mice and induce antigen-specific T and B cell responses similar to that observed with intracolorectal vaccination. Both rectal and vaginal mucosal surfaces serve as transmission routes for pathogenic microorganisms. Vaccination through large intestinal mucosa, previously proven protective for both of these mucosal sites in animal studies, can be achieved successfully by direct intracolorectal (i.c.r.) administration, but this route is clinically impractical. Oral vaccine delivery seems preferable but runs the risk of the vaccine's destruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we designed a large intestine–targeted oral delivery with pH-dependent microparticles containing vaccine nanoparticles, which induced colorectal immunity in mice comparably to colorectal vaccination and protected against rectal and vaginal viral challenge. Conversely, vaccine targeted to the small intestine induced only small intestinal immunity and provided no rectal or vaginal protection, demonstrating functional compartmentalization within the gut mucosal immune system. Therefore, using this oral vaccine delivery system to target the large intestine, but not the small intestine, may represent a feasible new strategy for immune protection of rectal and vaginal mucosa."

https://openalex.org/W1965641017,"Loss of p53 function is a critical event during tumorigenesis, with half of all cancers harboring mutations within the TP53 gene. Such events frequently result in the expression of a mutated p53 protein with gain-of-function properties that drive invasion and metastasis. Here, we show that the expression of miR-155 was up-regulated by mutant p53 to drive invasion. The miR-155 host gene was directly repressed by p63, providing the molecular basis for mutant p53 to drive miR-155 expression. Significant overlap was observed between miR-155 targets and the molecular profile of mutant p53-expressing breast tumors in vivo. A search for cancer-related target genes of miR-155 revealed ZNF652, a novel zinc-finger transcriptional repressor. ZNF652 directly repressed key drivers of invasion and metastasis, such as TGFB1, TGFB2, TGFBR2, EGFR, SMAD2 and VIM. Furthermore, silencing of ZNF652 in epithelial cancer cell lines promoted invasion into matrigel. Importantly, loss of ZNF652 expression in primary breast tumors was significantly correlated with increased local invasion and defined a population of breast cancer patients with metastatic tumors. Collectively, these findings suggest that miR-155 targeted therapies may provide an attractive approach to treat mutant p53-expressing tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2104739421,"Hongbing Shen and colleagues identify three new susceptibility loci for lung cancer in the Chinese population. Their follow-up analyses suggest that two of these loci interact multiplicatively with smoking dose to influence lung cancer risk. To find additional susceptibility loci for lung cancer, we tested promising associations from our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS)1 of lung cancer in the Chinese population in an extended validation sample size of 7,436 individuals with lung cancer (cases) and 7,483 controls. We found genome-wide significant (P < 5.0 × 10−8) evidence for three additional lung cancer susceptibility loci at 10p14 (rs1663689, close to GATA3, P = 2.84 × 10−10), 5q32 (rs2895680 in PPP2R2B-STK32A-DPYSL3, P = 6.60 × 10−9) and 20q13.2 (rs4809957 in CYP24A1, P = 1.20 × 10−8). We also found consistent associations for rs247008 at 5q31.1 (IL3-CSF2-P4HA2, P = 7.68 × 10−8) and rs9439519 at 1p36.32 (AJAP1-NPHP4, P = 3.65 × 10−6). Four of these loci showed evidence for interactions with smoking dose (P = 1.72 × 10−10, P = 5.07 × 10−3, P = 6.77 × 10−3 and P = 4.49 × 10−2 for rs2895680, rs4809957, rs247008 and rs9439519, respectively). These results advance our understanding of lung cancer susceptibility and highlight potential pathways that integrate genetic variants and smoking in the development of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2017523715,"Is Winter Past? Some plants are adapted to wait through the winter before their genetic programs for flowering are initiated. But the duration of winter varies with location, and thus, to avoid flowering too late into the summer or exposing blossoms to frost, the adaptation needs to hold the flowers off for just the right amount of time. Working with Arabidopsis thaliana , Coustham et al. (p. 584 , published online 12 July) identified a quantitative mechanism that “counts” off the duration of winter. FLC, a repressor of flowering, carries sequence polymorphisms that direct epigenetic events. Plants with fewer of these polymorphisms are adapted to short winters, and plants with all four polymorphisms are adapted to long winters."

https://openalex.org/W1969731848,"Amplification and rearrangements of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are frequently found in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The most common variant is EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII). Research suggests that EGFRvIII could be a marker for a cancer stem cell or tumor-initiating population. If amplification and rearrangement are early events in tumorigenesis, this implies that they should be preserved throughout the tumor. However, in primary GBM, EGFRvIII expression is focal and sporadic. Unexpectedly, we found EGFR amplification and rearrangement throughout the tumor, including regions with no EGFRvIII expression, suggesting that mechanisms exist to modulate EGFRvIII expression even in the presence of high gene amplification. To study this phenomenon, we characterized three GBM cell lines with endogenous EGFRvIII. EGFRvIII expression was heterogeneous, with both positive and negative populations maintaining the genetic alterations, akin to primary tumors. Furthermore, EGFRvIII defined a hierarchy where EGFRvIII-positive cells gave rise to additional positive and negative cells. Only cells that had recently lost EGFRvIII expression could re-express EGFRvIII, providing an important buffer for maintaining EGFRvIII-positive cell numbers. Epigenetic mechanisms had a role in maintaining heterogeneous EGFRvIII expression. Demethylation induced a 20–60% increase in the percentage of EGFRvIII-positive cells, indicating that some cells could re-express EGFRvIII. Surprisingly, inhibition of histone deacetylation resulted in a 50–80% reduction in EGFRvIII expression. Collectively, this data demonstrates that EGFR amplification and rearrangement are early events in tumorigenesis and EGFRvIII follows a model of hierarchical expression. Furthermore, EGFRvIII expression is restricted by epigenetic mechanisms, suggesting that drugs that modulate the epigenome might be used successfully in glioblastoma tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2012910563,"Na,K-ATPase is highly sensitive to changes in the redox state, and yet the mechanisms of its redox sensitivity remain unclear. We have explored the possible involvement of S-glutathionylation of the catalytic α subunit in redox-induced responses. For the first time, the presence of S-glutathionylated cysteine residues was shown in the α subunit in duck salt glands, rabbit kidneys, and rat myocardium. Exposure of the Na,K-ATPase to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) resulted in an increase in the number of S-glutathionylated cysteine residues. Increase in S-glutathionylation was associated with dose- and time-dependent suppression of the enzyme function up to its complete inhibition. The enzyme inhibition concurred with S-glutathionylation of the Cys-454, -458, -459, and -244. Upon binding of glutathione to these cysteines, the enzyme was unable to interact with adenine nucleotides. Inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase by GSSG did not occur in the presence of ATP at concentrations above 0.5 mm. Deglutathionylation of the α subunit catalyzed by glutaredoxin or dithiothreitol resulted in restoration of the Na,K-ATPase activity. Oxidation of regulatory cysteines made them inaccessible for glutathionylation but had no profound effect on the enzyme activity. Regulatory S-glutathionylation of the α subunit was induced in rat myocardium in response to hypoxia and was associated with oxidative stress and ATP depletion. S-Glutathionylation was followed by suppression of the Na,K-ATPase activity. The rat α2 isoform was more sensitive to GSSG than the α1 isoform. Our findings imply that regulatory S-glutathionylation of the catalytic subunit plays a key role in the redox-induced regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity.

Our findings imply that regulatory S-glutathionylation of the catalytic subunit plays a key role in the redox-induced regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity. Na,K-ATPase uses the energy of ATP to transport Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane, thus mediating the transmembrane ion gradients responsible for the generation of the action potential in excitable tissues and for the secondary active transport of ions and metabolic substrates (1Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Isozymes of the Na-K-ATPase. Heterogeneity in structure, diversity in function.Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar, 2Glitsch H.G. Electrophysiology of the sodium-potassium-ATPase in cardiac cells.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1791-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of α and β subunits. The catalytic α subunit is formed by the nucleotide binding, phosphorylation and actuator domains, and the ion transport pore. This subunit mediates ATP hydrolysis and ion transport. The β subunit is required for the enzyme translocation to the membrane and K+ transport (1Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Isozymes of the Na-K-ATPase. Heterogeneity in structure, diversity in function.Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar). In some tissues, the enzyme also contains a regulatory subunit belonging to the FXYD protein family. For each subunit, a number of isoforms showing tissue-specific expression patterns and functional diversity have been described (3Geering K. Functional roles of Na,K-ATPase subunits.Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2008; 17: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry of Na,K-ATPase.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase is known to be redox- and oxygen-sensitive in a number of cell types (5Bogdanova A. Petrushanko I. Boldyrev A.

Reversible oxidative modification. Implications for cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2010; 20: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). H2O2 inhibits Na,K-ATPase in brain and kidneys (7Kurella E.G. Tyulina O.V. Boldyrev A.A. Oxidative resistance of Na/K-ATPase.Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1999; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific α2β isozyme is more susceptible to reduction in activity by H2O2 than ubiquitously expressed α1β isozyme (8Xie Z. Jack-Hays M. Wang Y. Periyasamy S.M. Blanco G. Huang W.H. Askari A. Different oxidant sensitivities of the α1 and α2 isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previously, the inhibitory action of oxidants on the Na,K-ATPase was attributed to irreversible oxidation of thiol groups. Whereas the α subunit possesses 23 reduced cysteine residues, the β subunit has only one of them (7Kurella E.G. Tyulina O.V. Boldyrev A.A. Oxidative resistance of Na/K-ATPase.Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1999; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence suggests that redox-induced responses of the Na,K-ATPase cannot be explained by irreversible oxidation of –SH groups alone. Our earlier findings indicated that both loading of cerebellar granule cells with reduced glutathione (GSH) and GSH depletion were equally efficient in blocking Na,K-ATPase (9Petrushanko I.

Maximal activity of the enzyme in freshly isolated cerebellar neurons was only observed within a “physiological” range of pO2 and redox state characteristic for neonatal rat cerebellum. Hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions and oxidative and reductive stress were associated with a decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity (9Petrushanko I. Bogdanov N. Bulygina E. Grenacher B. Leinsoo T.

S-Glutathionylation of the Na,K-ATPase β1 and FXYD subunits has been recently demonstrated (16Figtree G.A. Liu C.C. Bibert S. Hamilton E.J. Garcia A. White C.N. Chia K.K. Cornelius F. Geering K.

S-Glutathionylation for any of the 23 evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues of the catalytic α subunit has never been reported. Fifteen of them are localized in the cytosolic loops of the subunit forming the ATP-binding site. These cysteine residues are potentially accessible for interaction with the cytosolic glutathione pool and for enzymes catalyzing deglutathionylation. Hence, we have hypothesized that S-glutathionylation of cysteine residues of the catalytic α subunit may be actively involved in redox-induced regulation of the Na,K-ATPase. Using purified enzyme preparations from rabbit kidneys and duck salt glands (α1β1 isozyme), and crude homogenate from isolated blood-perfused rat hearts (α1β and α2β isozymes), we have revealed the presence of basal and regulatory S-glutathionylation sites in the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase. Binding of glutathione to the Cys-454, -458, -459, and -244 was associated with complete inhibition of the enzyme. The inhibitory action of S-glutathionylation was caused by occlusion of the adenine nucleotide-binding site by glutathione. Animal handling and experimentation was approved by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office and the Bioethic Committee of the Faculty of Biology, M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University. Experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss and Russian Federation animal protection laws and institutional guidelines that comply with the guidelines of the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research. Wistar male rats (300–400 g) were anesthetized and heparinized, and 8–10 ml of blood and the heart were collected. The hearts were then perfused via aorta with autologous blood equilibrated with a humidified gas phase containing 20% (normoxia, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, SO2 = 98%) or 5% O2 (hypoxia, SO2 = 35%), 5% CO2, and 75 or 90% N2, 37 °C, 1 h) (13Komniski M.S.

Na,K-ATPase-specific activity of the duck enzyme reached ∼2400 μmol of Pi (mg of protein × h)−1 at 37 °C, and in rabbit preparations was 800–1200 μmol of Pi (mg of protein × h)−1. The activity of Na,K-ATPase (α1β and α2β isozymes) from the rat heart was assessed either in the crude homogenate prepared from ventricular tissue (13Komniski M.S. Yakushev S. Bogdanov N. Gassmann M.

Activity of the duck, rabbit, and rat Na,K-ATPase was measured as ouabain-sensitive (1 mm) ATP cleavage in the medium containing (in mm) 130 NaCl, 20 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 3 ATP, and 30 imidazole, pH 7.4, 37 °C, when not stated otherwise (9Petrushanko I.

Kinetics of the inhibitory action of GSSG on the rabbit Na,K-ATPase was monitored over 30 min in the presence of 25, 71.5, or 143 μm GSSG at room temperature. Samples containing 3–5 μg of Na,K-ATPase were collected every 5 min for activity measurements. An ∼500-fold excess of GSSG over the number of enzyme –SH groups made the Na,K-ATPase inhibition rate essentially independent of the inhibitor concentration. The interaction of GSSG with the enzyme was described by the pseudo-first order kinetics Equation 1,At=A0•e-k[GSSG]t(Eq. 1) where A0 and At are the enzyme initial and current activity; k is the inhibition rate constant; [GSSG] is the inhibitor concentration; and t is the time of exposure to GSSG. The product of k and [GSSG] was then determined from the slope of the linear plot showing ln(At/A0) as a function of time, and the inhibition rate constant was calculated. Na,K-ATPase activity was assessed as a function of the GSSG concentration. The purified duck and rabbit enzyme as well as the sarcolemmal fraction isolated from the ventricular homogenate were exposed to 0.05–1 mm GSSG. Na,K-ATPase activity was then plotted against GSSG concentration and fitted using the logistic sigmoid function to obtain the values of apparent IC50 values (22Cortés A. Cascante M. Cárdenas M.L.

S-Glutathionylation of the α1 and β1 subunits in purified Na,K-ATPase preparations and of the α1 subunit in the crude ventricular homogenates and sarcolemmal fraction were assessed using immunoblotting. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After the blocking procedure, mouse monoclonal anti-glutathione antibody (Chemicon Millipore, MAB5310) was added. The membranes were then stripped, and mouse monoclonal anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 antibody clone C464-6 (Upstate Millipore) and anti-Na,K-ATPase β1 antibody clone C464-8 (Upstate Millipore) were applied to detect the total amount of α1 and β1 subunits, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Densitometric analysis was performed, and the results were expressed as α1(β1)-SSG/total α1. The thermodynamic parameters of adenine nucleotide binding to rabbit Na,K-ATPase were measured using a MicroCal iTC200 instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA), as described elsewhere (23Mitkevich V.A.

Experiments with nonglutathionylated (dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 μm) and glutathionylated (GSSG, 1 mm) Na,K-ATPase were carried out at 25 °C in imidazole buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the ligand (3.8 μl, 20–30 μm) were injected into the cell containing 2–3 μm Na,K-ATPase to achieve a complete binding isotherm. To obtain the effective heat of binding, the heat of dilution was subtracted from the heat of the reaction. The resulting titration curves were fitted using the MicroCal Origin software, assuming one set of binding sites. Affinity constants (Ka) and enthalpy variations (ΔH) were determined, and the Gibbs energy (ΔG) and the entropy variations (ΔS) were calculated from Equation 2,ΔG=-RTlnKa=ΔH-TΔS(Eq. 2) Cysteine residues undergoing S-glutathionylation in the duck Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit were identified using MALDI-TOF MS. The enzyme was exposed to 1.7 mm GSH and 170 μm GSSG for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with SDS (5 min, 37 °C). α and β subunits were separated by SDS-PAGE in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol, and the band corresponding to the α1 subunit was excised and subjected to an in-gel digestion by trypsin (24Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. In-gel digestion for mass spectrometric characterization of proteins and proteomes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar) or by α-chymotrypsin. For in-gel digestion, α-chymotrypsin or trypsin was dissolved in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer solution in a concentration of 30 or 13 ng/μl correspondingly just before use. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the resulting peptide fragments was performed using Ultraflex II TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Tryptic fragments in solution were transferred onto the MTP 384 target plate polished steel TF mass spectrometric target, dried on air, and then overlaid with a matrix solution consisting of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (201346, Bruker Daltonics) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (201344, Bruker Daltonics) in concentrations of 2.4 and 3 mg/ml, respectively, in 50% acetonitrile in water, 0.1% TFA. Results of 4000 laser impulses (200 impulses from 20 different points of one spot) were summed up for every spectrum. The MS data were processed using Bruker Daltonics Flex Analysis 2.4 software, and the accuracy of mass determination of peptides was fixed to 100 ppm. Correlation of the MS data with the protein sequence was done using Bruker Daltonics BioTools 3.0 software. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of pig (P05024 in the UniProtKB database), duck (Q7ZYV1), rabbit (Q9N0Z6), and rat (P06685) indicates that the localization of cysteine residues is conserved in all species. This allowed us to use the existing crystallographic 3.5 Å structure of the porcine α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase (Protein Data Bank code 3b8e) to model the changes appearing in the enzyme after glutathionylation. Three-dimensional models of the S-glutathionylated Na,K-ATPase catalytic α1 subunit were created on the basis of the previously published 3.5 Å structure of the porcine α1 subunit (25Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P. Crystal structure of the sodium-potassium pump.Nature. 2007; 450: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Cartesian coordinates were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 3b8e). Corresponding cysteine residues in duck, rabbit, or rat α1 subunits are shifted upward by 2 compared with the numbering for cysteines in porcine α1 sequence (denoted as cysteinesp). For the simulation of S-glutathionylation, GSH molecules were inserted into the protein via disulfide bridges with cysteines. Two models have been built as follows: a model containing four glutathiones bound to the Cys-246p, -452p, -456p, and -457p residues, and a model with the ATP docked to the protein as described (26Grycova L. Sklenovsky P. Lansky Z. Janovska M. Otyepka M. Amler E. Teisinger J. Kubala M. ATP and magnesium drive conformational changes of the Na+/K+-ATPase cytoplasmic headpiece.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glutathione and ATP were inserted into protein with minimal geometric strain and no steric overlaps. Each model was subjected to energy minimization until convergence, using a combination of Steepest Descents, Conjugate Gradients, and Truncated Newton algorithms. The energy calculations were carried out under the MMFF94x force field using the MOE version 2009.10 modeling software (Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), 2011.10; Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Then the models were superimposed using the structural alignment by MOE software. Values are shown as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad InStat 3 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Either the Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test were applied depending on the type of experiments, and the difference was considered significant at p < 0.05. The presence of S-glutathionylated cysteine residues in ubiquitously expressed α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase was assessed using immunoblotting. Basal S-glutathionylation was observed in the α1 subunit of the duck (Fig. 1A), rabbit (Fig. 1C), and rat (Fig. 1D) enzyme. β1 subunit was also S-glutathionylated as shown in Fig. 1B for the duck enzyme preparation. S-Glutathionylation of the α1, but not of β1, subunit was further enhanced upon exposure of the enzyme to GSSG (1 mm) (Fig. 1, A–C). Treatment of the rabbit enzyme with 100 μm DTT reduced the basal S-glutathionylation level of the α1 subunit (Fig. 1C). Exposure of rat myocardium to hypoxia was associated with an increase in the α1 subunit S-glutathionylation in crude ventricular homogenates up to 1.5-fold over the values observed in normoxic heart (Fig. 1D). S-Glutathionylation of the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase in hypoxic myocardium occurred concurrently with an increase of GSSG levels in tissue from 86 ± 8 to 176 ± 10 μmol/liter tissue water. Exposure of the purified duck Na,K-ATPase to a mixture of 1.7 mm GSH and 170 μm GSSG imitating conditions occurring in hypoxic heart resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme. Exposure of rabbit Na,K-ATPase to GSSG resulted in time- and dose-dependent suppression of Na,K-ATPase activity (Fig. 2A). The inhibitory action of GSSG was biphasic. Fast interaction of GSSG with the enzyme accounting for ∼80% inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase was followed by a slow interaction phase leading to complete inactivation of the enzyme (Fig. 2B). The corresponding rate constants were 1655 m−1 min−1 for the fast and 163 m−1 min−1 for the slow interaction phases (Fig. 2B). The GSSG concentration at half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was similar for the rabbit and duck α1β1 isozymes (66 ± 3 and 59 ± 2 μm, respectively) (Fig. 3, A and B). Complete inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase by 100 μm GSSG was observed even at the presence of 10 mm GSH. The sensitivity of the duck Na,K-ATPase to GSSG was lost after 4 h of exposure of the enzyme to 20% O2 (air) at 4 °C prior to GSSG treatment (Fig. 3B). Similar desensitization to the inhibitory action of GSSG was confirmed for the rat sarcolemmal Na,K-ATPase pre-exposed to 100% O2 for 30 min prior to GSSG treatment (Fig. 4A). The loss of sensitivity to GSSG was not associated with any profound effect on the Na,K-ATPase function (Fig. 4). Prolonged (6–9 months) storage of myocardial tissue at −80 °C at 20% O2 (air) was associated with the same loss of sensitivity of the rat Na,K-ATPase to GSSG along with preservation of its hydrolytic activity. This did not occur in tissue samples stored in liquid nitrogen (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Effect of incubation of the SL fraction in the atmosphere of pure O2 and tissue storage at −80 °C in contact with air on the response of the Na,K-ATPase to hypoxia or GSSG treatment.

Inhibition of the enzyme contributed to significant Na+ accumulation in ventricular tissue (from 40.1 ± 4.3 to 55.0 ± 2.7 mmol kg−1 dry weight, p = 0.043) and K+ loss (from 269 ± 9 to 222 ± 15 mmol kg−1 dry weight, p = 0.031) during hypoxic exposure. Some of the enzyme remained inhibited by the α subunit S-glutathionylation even in normoxic myocardium because deglutathionylation (DTT exposure) was associated with only a modest increase in Na,K-ATPase activity (Fig. 5B). Induction of S-glutathionylation of the α subunit by supplementation of glutaredoxin 1 (GRX) 4The abbreviation used is: GRXglutaredoxin 1. and its substrates, NADPH and GSH, caused inhibition of the enzyme (Fig. 5B). The inhibitory effect of GRX treatment was directly proportional to the S-glutathionylation level (Fig. 5C). Depending on GSH/GSSG availability, GRX catalyzed either S-glutathionylation or deglutathionylation of the α subunit as described earlier for other GRX"

Deciphering the architectural strategies supporting intramembrane proteolysis is an essential but unattained goal. We integrated new, quantitative and high-throughput thermal light-scattering technology, reversible equilibrium unfolding and refolding and quantitative protease assays to interrogate rhomboid architecture with 151 purified variants. Rhomboid proteases maintain low intrinsic thermodynamic stability (ΔG = 2.1-4.5 kcal mol(-1)) resulting from a multitude of generally weak transmembrane packing interactions, making them highly responsive to their environment. Stability is consolidated by two buried glycines and several packing leucines, with a few multifaceted hydrogen bonds strategically deployed to two peripheral regions. Opposite these regions lie transmembrane segment 5 and connected loops that are notably exempt of structural responsibility, suggesting intramembrane proteolysis involves considerable but localized protein dynamics. Our analyses provide a comprehensive 'heat map' of the physiochemical anatomy underlying membrane-immersed enzyme function at, what is to our knowledge, unprecedented resolution."

Using in vitro blood–brain barrier model, we show that PLGF derived from SCLC cells triggers vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1-Rho-extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 signaling axis activation, results in disassembly of tight junction in brain endothelial cells and promotes SCLC cell transendothelial migration. Furthermore, the downregulation of PLGF suppresses SCLC cell metastasis to the brain in an experimental BM model.

https://openalex.org/W2025402420,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated malignancy most common in East Asia and Africa. Radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy are the main treatment options. Unfortunately, disease response to concurrent chemoradiotherapy varies among patients with NPC, and many cases are resistant to cisplatin. Increased DNA damage repair is one of the mechanisms contributing to this resistance. Jab1/CSN5 is a multifunctional protein that participates in controlling cell proliferation and the stability of multiple proteins. Jab1 overexpression has been found to correlate with poor prognosis in several tumor types. However, the biological significance of Jab1 activity in response to cancer treatment is unclear. In this study, we used three NPC cell lines (CNE1, CNE2 and HONE1) to investigate the hypothesis that Jab1 positively regulates the DNA repair protein Rad51 and, in turn, cellular response to treatment with DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, ionizing radiation (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We found that Jab1 was overexpressed in two relatively cisplatin-, IR- and UV-resistant NPC cell lines, and knocking down its expression conferred sensitivity to cisplatin, IR and UV radiation. By contrast, exogenous Jab1 expression enhanced the resistance of NPC cells to cisplatin, IR and UV radiation. Moreover, we provide a mechanism by which Jab1 positively regulated Rad51 through p53-dependent pathway, and increased ectopic expression of Rad51 conferred cellular resistance to cisplatin, IR and UV radiation in Jab1-deficient cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that Jab1 has an important role in the cellular response to cisplatin and irradiation by regulating DNA damage and repair pathways. Therefore, Jab1 is a novel biomarker for predicting the outcome of patients with NPC who are treated with DNA-damaging agents."

We hypothesized that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] inhibits cytokine secretion from adipocytes via direct inhibition of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). We utilized two different human models. Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) differentiated into adipocytes, and adipocytes isolated from biopsies stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with or without 1,25(OH)2D3. Expression and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis and ELISA. Assessment of NF-κB nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity was performed by immunofluorescence (IF) and electrophoretic mobility assay (EMSA). Inhibitor κB (IκB) and its phosphorylation were detected by Western blot (WB) analysis. Simultaneous 1,25(OH)2D3 cotreatment significantly reduced LPS-stimulated (10 ng/ml) IL-6 secretion dose dependently by 15% at 10–10 M and 26% at 10–7 M (P<0.05) in hMSCs, while preincubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10–7 M) for 24 h reduced IL-6 secretion by 24 and 35% (P<0.001) and mRNA levels by 34 and 30% (P<0.05) in hMSCs and isolated adipocytes, respectively. 1,25(OH)2D3 suppressed LPS-stimulated IκB phosphorylation-mediated NF-κB translocation into the nucleus were evident from WB, IF, and EMSA. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits LPS-stimulated IL-6 secretion in two human adipocyte models via interference with NF-κB signaling.—Mutt, S.

https://openalex.org/W2165120623,"A therapeutic strategy for treating cancer is to target and eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs) without harming their normal stem cell counterparts. The success of this approach relies on the identification of molecular pathways that selectively regulate CSC function. Using BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a disease model for CSCs, we show that BCR-ABL downregulates the Blk gene (encoding B-lymphoid kinase) through c-Myc in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in CML mice and that Blk functions as a tumor suppressor in LSCs but does not affect normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hematopoiesis. Blk suppresses LSC function through a pathway involving an upstream regulator, Pax5, and a downstream effector, p27. Inhibition of this Blk pathway accelerates CML development, whereas increased activity of the Blk pathway delays CML development. Blk also suppresses the proliferation of human CML stem cells. Our results show the feasibility of selectively targeting LSCs, an approach that should be applicable to other cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2011113518,"The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade regulates various biological functions, including cell growth, proliferation and survival. As such, this pathway is often deregulated in cancer, including melanomas, which frequently harbour activating mutations in the NRAS and BRAF oncogenes. Hyperactive MAPK signalling is known to promote protein synthesis, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Raf promotes the constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference, we find that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) is partly required for these effects. Using melanoma cell lines carrying activating BRAF mutations, we show that ERK/RSK signalling regulates assembly of the translation initiation complex and polysome formation, as well as the translation of growth-related messenger RNAs containing a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif. Accordingly, we find that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour growth in mice. Our findings indicate that RSK may be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of tumours characterized by deregulated MAPK signalling, such as melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2059788227,"Although heme is a crucial element for many biological processes including respiration, heme homeostasis should be regulated strictly due to the cytotoxicity of free heme molecules. Numerous lactic acid bacteria, including Lactococcus lactis, acquire heme molecules exogenously to establish an aerobic respiratory chain. A heme efflux system plays an important role for heme homeostasis to avoid cytotoxicity of acquired free heme, but its regulatory mechanism is not clear. Here, we report that the transcriptional regulator heme-regulated transporter regulator (HrtR) senses and binds a heme molecule as its physiological effector to regulate the expression of the heme-efflux system responsible for heme homeostasis in L. lactis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how HrtR senses a heme molecule and regulates gene expression for the heme efflux system, we determined the crystal structures of the apo-HrtR·DNA complex, apo-HrtR, and holo-HrtR at a resolution of 2.0, 3.1, and 1.9 Å, respectively. These structures revealed that HrtR is a member of the TetR family of transcriptional regulators. The residue pair Arg-46 and Tyr-50 plays a crucial role for specific DNA binding through hydrogen bonding and a CH-π interaction with the DNA bases. HrtR adopts a unique mechanism for its functional regulation upon heme sensing. Heme binding to HrtR causes a coil-to-helix transition of the α4 helix in the heme-sensing domain, which triggers a structural change of HrtR, causing it to dissociate from the target DNA for derepression of the genes encoding the heme efflux system. HrtR uses a unique heme-sensing motif with bis-His (His-72 and His-149) ligation to the heme, which is essential for the coil-to-helix transition of the α4 helix upon heme sensing."

We tested this hypothesis by analyzing transgenic mice expressing the mutant D452A-DSPP in the Dspp-knock-out (Dspp-KO) background (referred to as ""Dspp-KO/D452A-Tg"" mice). We employed multipronged approaches to characterize the dentin of the Dspp-KO/D452A-Tg mice, in comparison with Dspp-KO mice and mice expressing the normal DSPP transgene in the Dspp-KO background (named Dspp-KO/normal-Tg mice). Our analyses showed that 90% of the D452A-DSPP in the dentin of Dspp-KO/D452A-Tg mice was not cleaved, indicating that D452A substitution effectively blocked the proteolytic processing of DSPP in vivo. While the expression of the normal DSPP fully rescued the dentin defects of the Dspp-KO mice, expressing the D452A-DSPP failed to do so. These results indicate that the proteolytic processing of DSPP is an activation step essential to its biological function in dentinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2160507736,"Ovarian granulosa cell tumors (OGCT) are the most frequent kind of sex cord-stromal tumors, and represent ∼2–5% of all ovarian malignancies. OGCTs exist as two entities, juvenile and adult types, with specific clinical and pathological characteristics. The molecular pathogenesis of these tumors has just begun to be unraveled. Indeed, recent studies have indicated that mutation and/or misregulation of the key ovarian transcription factor FOXL2 has a role in OGCT formation, although the mechanisms remain unclear. To better understand the molecular characteristics of OGCT, we studied the transcriptomic profiles of ten human adult-type OGCT samples, as well as ethnically matched granulosa cell (GC) controls. We find that the OGCT samples analyzed herein exhibit several hallmarks of cancer, including increased expression of genes linked to cell proliferation, but decreased expression of those conferring sensitivity to cell death. Moreover, genes differentially expressed in OGCTs are significantly enriched for known FOXL2 target genes, consistently with the prevalence of FOXL2 somatic mutation in these tumors. Expression of these targets is altered in a way expected to promote malignant transformation, for instance, through induction of genes associated with faster cell cycling and downregulation of genes associated with cell death. Over time, such defects may be responsible at least partly for the malignant transformation of healthy GCs into OGCT. These insights into the molecular pathogenesis of OGCTs may open the way to new efforts in the development of more targeted therapeutic strategies for OGCT patients."
https://openalex.org/W2109689484,"Aldosterone stimulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is involved in numerous physiological responses, including Na+ homeostasis, blood pressure control, and heart failure. Aldosterone binding to MR promotes different post-translational modifications that regulate MR nuclear translocation, gene expression, and finally receptor degradation. Here, we show that aldosterone stimulates rapid phosphorylation of MR via ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner (from 0.1 to 10 nM) in renal epithelial cells. This phosphorylation induces an increase of MR apparent molecular weight, with a maximal upward shift of 30 kDa. Strikingly, these modifications are critical for the regulation of the MR ubiquitylation state. Indeed, we find that MR is monoubiquitylated in its basal state, and this status is sustained by the tumor suppressor gene 101 (Tsg101). Phosphorylation leads to disruption of MR/Tsg101 association and monoubiquitin removal. These events prompt polyubiquitin-dependent destabilization of MR and degradation. Preventing MR phosphorylation by ERK1/2 inhibition or mutation of target serines affects the sequential mechanisms of MR ubiquitylation and inhibits the aldosterone-mediated degradation. Our data provide a novel model of negative feedback of aldosterone signaling, involving sequential phosphorylation, monoubiquitin removal and subsequent polyubiquitylation/degradation of MR.—Faresse, N., Vitagliano, J.-J., Staub, O.

In the present study, we show that BRSK2 is also abundantly expressed in pancreatic islets and MIN6 β-cell line. Yeast two-hybrid screening, GST fusion protein pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays reveal that BRSK2 interacts with CDK-related protein kinase PCTAIRE1, a kinase involved in neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter release. In MIN6 cells, BRSK2 co-localizes with PCTAIRE1 in the cytoplasm and phosphorylates one of its serine residues, Ser-12. Phosphorylation of PCTAIRE1 by BRSK2 reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in MIN6 cells. Conversely, knockdown of BRSK2 by siRNA increases serum insulin levels in mice. Our results reveal a novel function of BRSK2 in the regulation of GSIS in β-cells via a PCTAIRE1-dependent mechanism and suggest that BRSK2 is an attractive target for developing novel diabetic drugs.

https://openalex.org/W1972493003,"Hormonal therapies, mainly combinations of anti-androgens and androgen deprivation, have been the mainstay treatment for advanced prostate cancer because the androgen-androgen receptor (AR) system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancers. However, the emergence of androgen resistance, largely due to inefficient anti-hormone action, limits the therapeutic usefulness of these therapies. Here, we report that 6-(3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)-N-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)nicotinamide (DIMN) acts as a novel anti-androgenic compound that may be effective in the treatment of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers. Through AR structure-based virtual screening using the FlexX docking model, fifty-four compounds were selected and further screened for AR antagonism via cell-based tests. One compound, DIMN, showed an antagonistic effect specific to AR with comparable potency to that of the classical AR antagonists, hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. Consistent with their anti-androgenic activity, DIMN inhibited the growth of androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, the compound also suppressed the growth of androgen-independent C4-2 and CWR22rv prostate cancer cells, which express a functional AR, but did not suppress the growth of the AR-negative prostate cancer cells PPC-1, DU145, and R3327-AT3.1. Taken together, the results suggest that the synthetic compound DIMN is a novel anti-androgen and strong candidate for useful therapeutic agent against early stage to advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1980877346,"Synovial sarcoma is a deadly malignancy with limited sensitivity to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. SS18-SSX fusion oncogene expression characterizes human synovial sarcomas and drives oncogenesis in a mouse model. Elevated expression of BCL2 is considered a consistent feature of the synovial sarcoma expression profile. Our objective was to evaluate the expression of apoptotic pathway members in synovial sarcomas and interrogate the impact of modulating SS18-SSX expression on this pathway. We show in human and murine synovial sarcoma cells that SS18-SSX increases BCL2 expression, but represses other anti-apoptotic genes, including MCL1 and BCL2A1. This repression is achieved by directly suppressing expression via binding through activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) response element (CRE) in the promoters of these genes and recruiting TLE1/Groucho. The suppression of these two anti-apoptotic pathways silences the typical routes by which other tumors evade BH3-domain peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy. We show that mouse and human synovial sarcoma cells are sensitive in vitro to ABT-263, a BH3-peptidomimetic, much more than the other tested cancer cell lines. ABT-263 also enhances the sensitivity of these cells to doxorubicin, a traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy used for synovial sarcoma. We also demonstrate the capacity of ABT-263 to stunt synovial sarcomagenesis in vivo in a genetic mouse model. These data recommend pursuit of BH3-peptidomimetic pharmacotherapy in human synovial sarcomas."

Our earlier studies identified Pam to be associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, ubiquitinating TSC2 and regulating mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Here, we examine the potential involvement of the TSC/mTOR complex 1(mTORC1) signaling pathway in Phr1-deficient mouse models. We observed attenuation of mTORC1 signaling in the brains of both Phr1Δ8,9 and Phr1Magellan mouse models. Our results establish that Pam regulates TSC/mTOR signaling in vitro and in vivo through two distinct domains. To further address whether Pam regulates mTORC1 through two functionally independent domains, we undertook heterozygous mutant crossing between Phr1Δ8,9 and Phr1Magellan mice to generate a compound heterozygous model to determine whether these two domains can complement each other. mTORC1 signaling was not attenuated in the brains of double mutants (Phr1Δ8,9/Mag), confirming that Pam displays dual regulation of the mTORC1 pathway through two functional domains. Our results also suggest that although dysregulation of mTORC1 signaling may be responsible for the corpus callosum defects, other neurodevelopmental defects observed with Phr1 deficiency are independent of mTORC1 signaling.

C., Anbar, A. D., and Oremland, R. S. (2011) Science 332, 1163-1166) described the isolation of a special bacterial strain, GFAJ-1, that could grow in medium containing arsenate, but lacking phosphate, and that supposedly could substitute arsenic for phosphorus in its biological macromolecules. Here, we provide an alternative explanation for these observations and show that they can be reproduced in a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli. We find that arsenate induces massive ribosome degradation, which provides a source of phosphate. A small number of arsenate-tolerant cells arise during the long lag period prior to initiation of growth in +As/-P medium, and it is this population that undergoes the very slow, limited growth observed for both E. coli and GFAJ-1. These results provide a simple explanation for the reported growth of GFAJ-1 in arsenate without invoking replacement of phosphorus by arsenic in biological macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W2114861074,"The androgen receptor (AR) recognizes two types of DNA elements that are dimers of 5′-AGAACA-3′-like hexamers, either organized as inverted or direct repeats. We developed a mouse model [(specificity affecting AR knock-in (SPARKI)] in which the AR DNA-binding domain was mutated such that it lost binding to direct repeats but not to inverted elements. The impaired fertility of the male SPARKI mice correlates with the reduced motility of the spermatozoa, a characteristic that is developed during transit through the epididymis. Comparative transcriptome analyses revealed that the expression of 39 genes is changed in SPARKI epididymis. Remarkably, the expression of the steroid 5α-reductase type II (Srd5α2) gene, which metabolizes testosterone into the more potent dihydrotestosterone, is reduced 4-fold in SPARKI vs. wild type. The comparison of the SPARKI phenotype with that of Srd5α2-knockout mice shows, however, that the reduced Srd5α2 expression cannot explain all defects of the SPARKI epididymis. Moreover, we describe three new selective androgen response elements (AREs), which control the androgen responsiveness of the Srd5α2 gene. We conclude that the SPARKI model can be considered a knockout model for AR functioning via selective AREs and that this has a dramatic effect on sperm maturation in the epididymis.—Kerkhofs, S., Dubois, V., De Gendt, K., Helsen, C., Clinckemalie, L., Spans, L., Schuit, F., Boonen, S., Vanderschueren, D., Saunders, P.

https://openalex.org/W2073816994,"Although it was identified in the cell wall of several pathogenic mycobacteria, the biological properties of dimycolyl-diarabino-glycerol have not been documented yet. In this study an apolar glycolipid, presumably corresponding to dimycolyl-diarabino-glycerol, was purified from Mycobacterium marinum and subsequently identified as a 5-O-mycolyl-β-Araf-(1→2)-5-O-mycolyl-α-Araf-(1→1')-glycerol (designated Mma_DMAG) using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analyses. Lipid composition analysis revealed that mycolic acids were dominated by oxygenated mycolates over α-mycolates and devoid of trans-cyclopropane functions. Highly purified Mma_DMAG was used to demonstrate its immunomodulatory activity. Mma_DMAG was found to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β) in human macrophage THP-1 cells and to trigger the expression of ICAM-1 and CD40 cell surface antigens. This activation mechanism was dependent on TLR2, but not on TLR4, as demonstrated by (i) the use of neutralizing anti-TLR2 and -TLR4 antibodies and by (ii) the detection of secreted alkaline phosphatase in HEK293 cells co-transfected with the human TLR2 and secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase reporter genes. In addition, transcriptomic analyses indicated that various genes encoding proinflammatory factors were up-regulated after exposure of THP-1 cells to Mma_DMAG. Importantly, a wealth of other regulated genes related to immune and inflammatory responses, including chemokines/cytokines and their respective receptors, adhesion molecules, and metalloproteinases, were found to be modulated by Mma_DMAG. Overall, this study suggests that DMAG may be an active cell wall glycoconjugate driving host-pathogen interactions and participating in the immunopathogenesis of mycobacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2108687770,"The Mre11-Rad50 (MR) complex is a central player in DNA repair and is implicated in the processing of DNA ends caused by double strand breaks. Recent crystal structures of the MR complex suggest that several conformational rearrangements occur during its ATP hydrolysis cycle. A comparison of the Mre11 dimer interface from these structures suggests that the interface is dynamic in nature and may adopt several different arrangements. To probe the functional significance of the Mre11 dimer interface, we have generated and characterized a dimer disruption Mre11 mutant (L101D-Mre11). Although L101D-Mre11 binds to Rad50 and dsDNA with affinity comparable with the wild-type enzyme, it does not activate the ATP hydrolysis activity of Rad50, suggesting that the allosteric communication between Mre11 and Rad50 has been interrupted. Additionally, the dsDNA exonuclease activity of the L101D-MR complex has been reduced by 10-fold under conditions where processive exonuclease activity is required. However, we unexpectedly found that under steady state conditions, the nuclease activity of the L101D-MR complex is significantly greater than that of the wild-type complex. Based on steady state and single-turnover nuclease assays, we have assigned the rate-determining step of the steady state nuclease reaction to be the productive assembly of the complex at the dsDNA end. Together, our data suggest that the Mre11 dimer interface adopts at least two different states during the exonuclease reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2067339051,"Vertebrate Tob/BTG proteins inhibit cell proliferation when overexpressed in tissue-culture cells, and they can function as tumor suppressors in mice. The single Caenorhabditis elegans Tob/BTG ortholog, FOG-3, by contrast, was identified from its loss-of-function phenotype as a regulator of sperm fate specification. Here we report that FOG-3 also regulates proliferation in the germline tissue. We first demonstrate that FOG-3 is a positive regulator of germline proliferation. Thus, fog-3 null mutants possess fewer germ cells than normal, a modest but reproducible decrease observed for each of two distinct fog-3 null alleles. A similar decrease also occurred in fog-3/+ heterozygotes, again for both fog-3 alleles, revealing a haplo-insufficient effect on proliferation. Therefore, FOG-3 normally promotes proliferation, and two copies of the fog-3 gene are required for this function. We next overexpressed FOG-3 by removal of FBF, the collective term for FBF-1 and FBF-2, two nearly identical PUF RNA-binding proteins. We find that overexpressed FOG-3 blocks proliferation in fbf-1 fbf-2 mutants; whereas germ cells stop dividing and instead differentiate in fbf-1 fbf-2 double mutants, they continue to proliferate in fog-3; fbf-1 fbf-2 triple mutants. Therefore, like its vertebrate Tob/BTG cousins, overexpressed FOG-3 is 'antiproliferative'. Indeed, some fog-3; fbf-1 fbf-2 mutants possess small tumors, suggesting that FOG-3 can act as a tumor suppressor. Finally, we show that FOG-3 and FBF work together to promote tumor formation in animals carrying oncogenic Notch mutations. A similar effect was not observed when germline tumors were induced by manipulation of other regulators; therefore, this FOG-3 tumor-promoting effect is context dependent. We conclude that FOG-3 can either promote or inhibit proliferation in a manner that is sensitive to both genetic context and gene dosage. The discovery of these FOG-3 effects on proliferation has implications for our understanding of vertebrate Tob/BTG proteins and their influence on normal development and tumorigenesis."
