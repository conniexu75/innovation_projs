Light can also be structured into vortices that carry optical angular momentum, which can be used for micromanipulation and enhancing the capacity of optical communication channels. Devlin et al. present a metasurface converter for optical states that transforms polarization states into optical angular momentum states. The coupling between arbitrary spin and optical angular momentum states of light in a compact planar structure may find applications in producing complex structured light fields.

Both viruses can cause severe diseases in humans with catastrophic sequelae. It has been suspected in humans, and shown in animal models, that the host's immune responses can make disease worse. Katzelnick et al. examined data from a long-term study of Nicaraguan children exposed to dengue virus (see the Perspective by Feinberg and Ahmed). They confirmed that antibody-dependent enhancement of disease occurs at a specific range of antibody concentrations. Low levels of antibody did not enhance disease, intermediate levels exacerbated disease, and high antibody titers protected against severe disease. These findings have major implications for vaccines against flaviviruses. Indeed, recent vaccine trials have shown evidence of severe disease in some recipients who were previously exposed to virus.

https://openalex.org/W2766127467,"Interfaces between organelles are emerging as critical platforms for many biological responses in eukaryotic cells. In yeast, the ERMES complex is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria tether composed of four proteins, three of which contain a SMP (synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid binding protein) domain. No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-mitochondria contacts. The SMP domain of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP domain found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells. In neurons, PDZD8 was required for calcium ion (Ca2+) uptake by mitochondria after synaptically induced Ca2+-release from ER and thereby regulated cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics. Thus, PDZD8 represents a critical ER-mitochondria tethering protein in metazoans. We suggest that ER-mitochondria coupling is involved in the regulation of dendritic Ca2+ dynamics in mammalian neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2765933841,"Plasmonics provides a possible route to overcome both the speed limitations of electronics and the critical dimensions of photonics. We present an all-plasmonic 116-gigabits per second electro-optical modulator in which all the elements-the vertical grating couplers, splitters, polarization rotators, and active section with phase shifters-are included in a single metal layer. The device can be realized on any smooth substrate surface and operates with low energy consumption. Our results show that plasmonics is indeed a viable path to an ultracompact, highest-speed, and low-cost technology that might find many applications in a wide range of fields of sensing and communications because it is compatible with and can be placed on a wide variety of materials."
https://openalex.org/W2766228063,"The irradiation of gold nanorod colloids with a femtosecond laser can be tuned to induce controlled nanorod reshaping, yielding colloids with exceptionally narrow localized surface plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and volume are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the heat dissipation rate: Low cooling rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast cooling has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between irradiation fluence and surface density of the surfactant on the nanorods. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold nanorods with an optical response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit."
https://openalex.org/W2765383168,"We present an atomic model of a substrate-bound inner mitochondrial membrane AAA+ quality control protease in yeast, YME1. Our ~3.4-angstrom cryo-electron microscopy structure reveals how the adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) form a closed spiral staircase encircling an unfolded substrate, directing it toward the flat, symmetric protease ring. Three coexisting nucleotide states allosterically induce distinct positioning of tyrosines in the central channel, resulting in substrate engagement and translocation to the negatively charged proteolytic chamber. This tight coordination by a network of conserved residues defines a sequential, around-the-ring adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis cycle that results in stepwise substrate translocation. A hingelike linker accommodates the large-scale nucleotide-driven motions of the ATPase spiral relative to the planar proteolytic base. The translocation mechanism is likely conserved for other AAA+ ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2951695874,"Genetic elements compete for transmission through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their transmission through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2752930120,"Ultrafast processes in matter, such as the electron emission following light absorption, can now be studied using ultrashort light pulses of attosecond duration ($10^{-18}$s) in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The lack of spectral resolution due to the use of short light pulses may raise serious issues in the interpretation of the experimental results and the comparison with detailed theoretical calculations. Here, we determine photoionization time delays in neon atoms over a 40 eV energy range with an interferometric technique combining high temporal and spectral resolution. We spectrally disentangle direct ionization from ionization with shake up, where a second electron is left in an excited state, thus obtaining excellent agreement with theoretical calculations and thereby solving a puzzle raised by seven-year-old measurements. Our experimental approach does not have conceptual limits, allowing us to foresee, with the help of upcoming laser technology, ultra-high resolution time-frequency studies from the visible to the x-ray range."
https://openalex.org/W2766906926,"The spice turmeric, with its active polyphenol curcumin, has been used as anti-inflammatory remedy in traditional Asian medicine for centuries. Many cellular targets of curcumin have been identified, but how such a wide range of targets can be affected by a single compound is unclear. Here, we identified curcumin as a pro-drug that requires oxidative activation into reactive metabolites to exert anti-inflammatory activities. Synthetic curcumin analogs that undergo oxidative transformation potently inhibited the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), whereas stable, non-oxidizable analogs were less active, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of IC50 versus log of autoxidation rate of 0.75. Inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis, which protects cells from reactive metabolites, increased the potency of curcumin and decreased the amount of curcumin-glutathione adducts in cells. Oxidative metabolites of curcumin adducted to and inhibited the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit β (IKKβ), an activating kinase upstream of NF-κB. An unstable, alkynyl-tagged curcumin analog yielded abundant adducts with cellular protein that were decreased by pretreatment with curcumin or an unstable analog but not by a stable analog. Bioactivation of curcumin occurred readily in vitro, which may explain the wide range of cellular targets, but if bioactivation is insufficient in vivo, it may also help explain the inconclusive results in human studies with curcumin so far. We conclude that the paradigm of metabolic bioactivation uncovered here should be considered for the evaluation and design of clinical trials of curcumin and other polyphenols of medicinal interest."
https://openalex.org/W2765520149,"High-throughput sequencing metabarcoding studies in marine biosecurity have largely focused on targeting environmental DNA (eDNA). DNA can persist extracellularly in the environment, making discrimination of living organisms difficult. In this study, bilge water samples (i.e., water accumulating on-board a vessel during transit) were collected from 15 small recreational and commercial vessels. eDNA and eRNA molecules were co-extracted and the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene targeted for metabarcoding. In total, 62.7% of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified at least once in the corresponding eDNA and eRNA reads, with 19.5% unique to eDNA and 17.7% to eRNA. There were substantial differences in diversity between molecular compartments; 57% of sequences from eDNA-only OTUs belonged to fungi, likely originating from legacy DNA. In contrast, there was a higher percentage of metazoan (50.2%) and ciliate (31.7%) sequences in the eRNA-only OTUs. Our data suggest that the presence of eRNA-only OTUs could be due to increased cellular activities of some rare taxa that were not identified in the eDNA datasets, unusually high numbers of rRNA transcripts in ciliates, and/or artefacts produced during the reverse transcriptase, PCR and sequencing steps. The proportions of eDNA/eRNA shared and unshared OTUs were highly heterogeneous within individual bilge water samples. Multiple factors including boat type and the activities performed on-board, such as washing of scientific equipment, may play a major role in contributing to this variability. For some marine biosecurity applications analysis, eDNA-only data may be sufficient, however there are an increasing number of instances where distinguishing the living portion of a community is essential. For these circumstances, we suggest only including OTUs that are present in both eDNA and eRNA data. OTUs found only in the eRNA data need to be interpreted with caution until further research provides conclusive evidence for their origin."
https://openalex.org/W2766714276,"Although stereochemistry has been a central focus of the molecular sciences since Pasteur, its province has previously been restricted to the nanometric scale. We have programmed the self-assembly of micron-sized colloidal clusters with structural information stemming from a nanometric arrangement. This was done by combining DNA nanotechnology with colloidal science. Using the functional flexibility of DNA origami in conjunction with the structural rigidity of colloidal particles, we demonstrate the parallel self-assembly of three-dimensional microconstructs, evincing highly specific geometry that includes control over position, dihedral angles, and cluster chirality."
https://openalex.org/W2766134112,"Insects and mammals share similarities of neural organization underlying the perception of odors, taste, vision, sound, and gravity. We observed that insect somatosensation also corresponds to that of mammals. In Drosophila, the projections of all the somatosensory neuron types to the insect's equivalent of the spinal cord segregated into modality-specific layers comparable to those in mammals. Some sensory neurons innervate the ventral brain directly to form modality-specific and topological somatosensory maps. Ascending interneurons with dendrites in matching layers of the nerve cord send axons that converge to respective brain regions. Pathways arising from leg somatosensory neurons encode distinct qualities of leg movement information and play different roles in ground detection. Establishment of the ground pattern and genetic tools for neuronal manipulation should provide the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying somatosensation."
https://openalex.org/W2765891825,"The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, causing severe disease in humans and livestock across Africa. We determined the x-ray structure of the RVFV class II fusion protein Gc in its postfusion form and in complex with a glycerophospholipid (GPL) bound in a conserved cavity next to the fusion loop. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations further revealed a built-in motif allowing en bloc insertion of the fusion loop into membranes, making few nonpolar side-chain interactions with the aliphatic moiety and multiple polar interactions with lipid head groups upon membrane restructuring. The GPL head-group recognition pocket is conserved in the fusion proteins of other arthropod-borne viruses, such as Zika and chikungunya viruses, which have recently caused major epidemics worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2766383269,"The mammalian neocortex contains many cell types, but whether they organize into repeated structures has been unclear. We discovered that major cell types in neocortical layer 5 form a lattice structure in many brain areas. Large-scale three-dimensional imaging revealed that distinct types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons form cell type–specific radial clusters termed microcolumns. Thousands of microcolumns, in turn, are patterned into a hexagonal mosaic tessellating diverse regions of the neocortex. Microcolumn neurons demonstrate synchronized in vivo activity and visual responses with similar orientation preference and ocular dominance. In early postnatal development, microcolumns are coupled by cell type–specific gap junctions and later serve as hubs for convergent synaptic inputs. Thus, layer 5 neurons organize into a brainwide modular system, providing a template for cortical processing."

S48168/ARM210, an RyR calcium release channel stabilizer (a Rycal compound), is expected to enhance the rebinding of calstabin to the RyR channel complex and possibly alleviate the pathologic Ca2+ leakage in dystrophin-deficient skeletal and cardiac muscle. This study systematically investigated the effect of S48168/ARM210 on the phenotype of mdx mice by means of a first proof-of-concept, short (4 wk), phase 1 treatment, followed by a 12-wk treatment (phase 2) performed in parallel by 2 independent laboratories. The mdx mice were treated with S48168/ARM210 at two different concentrations (50 or 10 mg/kg/d) in their drinking water for 4 and 12 wk, respectively. The mice were subjected to treadmill sessions twice per week (12 m/min for 30 min) to unmask the mild disease. This testing was followed by in vivo forelimb and hindlimb grip strength and fatigability measurement, ex vivo extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and diaphragm (DIA) force contraction measurement and histologic and biochemical analysis. The treatments resulted in functional (grip strength, ex vivo force production in DIA and EDL muscles) as well as histologic improvement after 4 and 12 wk, with no adverse effects. Furthermore, levels of cellular biomarkers of calcium homeostasis increased. Therefore, these data suggest that S48168/ARM210 may be a safe therapeutic option, at the dose levels tested, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).—Capogrosso, R.

https://openalex.org/W2765693986,"Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arboviruses that may be controlled on an area-wide basis using the sterile insect technique (SIT). Larval diet is a major factor in mass-rearing for SIT programs. We compared dietary effects on immature development and adult fitness-related characteristics for an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) diet, developed for rearing Ae. albopictus, and a standardized laboratory rodent diet (LRD), under a 14:10 h (light:dark) photoperiod (""light"" treatment) or continuous darkness during larval rearing. Larval development was generally fastest in the IAEA diet, likely reflecting the high protein and lipid content of this diet. The proportion of larvae that survived to pupation or to adult emergence did not differ significantly between diets or light treatments. Insects from the LRD-dark treatment produced the highest proportion of male pupae (93% at 24 h after the beginning of pupation) whereas adult sex ratio from the IAEA diet tended to be more male-biased than that of the LRD diet. Adult longevity did not differ significantly with larval diet or light conditions, irrespective of sex. In other aspects the LRD diet generally performed best. Adult males from the LRD diet were significantly larger than those from the IAEA diet, irrespective of light treatment. Females from the LRD diet had ~25% higher fecundity and ~8% higher egg fertility compared to those from the IAEA diet. Adult flight ability did not differ between larval diets, and males had a similar number of copulations with wild females, irrespective of larval diet. The LRD diet had lower protein and fat content but a higher carbohydrate and energetic content than the IAEA diet. We conclude that the LRD diet is a low-cost standardized diet that is likely to be suitable for mass-rearing of Ae. aegypti for area-wide SIT-based vector control."

Against this backdrop, the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation, signed on 11 May 2017 by foreign ministers of the eight Arctic States, including the U.S. and Russia, as well as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, is a milestone. This “Arctic Science Agreement” is a strong signal reaffirming the global relevance of science as a tool of diplomacy, reflecting a common interest to promote scientific cooperation even when diplomatic channels among nations are unstable (1–3). It provides a framework for enhancing the efforts of scientists working on cutting-edge issues, but translating the general language of the agreement into enhanced action requires further attention, collaboration, and effort among diplomats and scientists to ensure its successful implementation. With the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) convening the International Science Initiative in the Russian Arctic (ISIRA) at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow next week, we highlight steps to advance science, its contributions to informed decision-making, and its role in maintaining the Arctic as a zone of peace and cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2765254708,"Authorship attribution is to identify the most likely author of a given sample among a set of candidate known authors. It can be not only applied to discover the original author of plain text, such as novels, blogs, emails, posts etc., but also used to identify source code programmers. Authorship attribution of source code is required in diverse applications, ranging from malicious code tracking to solving authorship dispute or software plagiarism detection. This paper aims to propose a new method to identify the programmer of Java source code samples with a higher accuracy. To this end, it first introduces back propagation (BP) neural network based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) into authorship attribution of source code. It begins by computing a set of defined feature metrics, including lexical and layout metrics, structure and syntax metrics, totally 19 dimensions. Then these metrics are input to neural network for supervised learning, the weights of which are output by PSO and BP hybrid algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a collected dataset with 3,022 Java files belong to 40 authors. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves 91.060% accuracy. And a comparison with previous work on authorship attribution of source code for Java language illustrates that this proposed method outperforms others overall, also with an acceptable overhead."
https://openalex.org/W2765933405,"Due to the limited availability of viral load testing for treatment outcome monitoring in resource limited settings, identifying predictive factors of antiretroviral treatment failure will help in selecting clients who will benefit most from the targeted use of viral load monitoring. Little is known about the predictors of treatment failure in the study area. This study was conducted to determine factors that predict first-line antiretroviral therapy failure among HIV-infected adult clients at Woldia Hospital, Northeast Ethiopia. For this study, antiretroviral therapy treatment failure was defined as the fulfillment of clinical and/or immunological criteria set by WHO.Case-control study was carried out from November to December 2014. Cases were adult clients who were on failing first line regimen and on active follow up while controls were those adult clients on a non-failing first-line regimen for 36 months and above and on active follow up. Data was entered in to Epi Info version 7 and was exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Binary logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of ART failure.A total of 59 cases and 245 controls were included in the analysis. Sixty three percent of the participants were females and the median age at ART enrollment was 33 years (IQR; 28, 40). The median baseline CD4count was not significantly different among cases and controls (105 (IQR = 60-174)vs.131 (IQR = 72.5-189.0); p = 0.301). The median peak CD4 count in the failure group (230 (IQR = 123-387)) was significantly low compared to the non-failure group (463 (IQR = 348.5-577)) [p < 0.001]. High peak CD4count (AOR = 0.993; 95% CI 0.990, 0.996) and longer duration on ART (AOR = 0.923; 95% CI 0.893, 0.954) were protective of treatment failure. In addition stavudine based regimen (AOR = 3.47; 95% CI 1.343, 10.555), low baseline BMI (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI 1.012, 7.457), unemployment (AOR = 4.93; 95% CI 1.493, 16.305) and formal educational level (AOR = 5.15; 95% CI 1.534, 17.276) were independently significant predictors of treatment failure.In this setting low peak CD4count, shorter duration on first line ART, d4T based regimen, low baseline BMI, unemployment and formal educational level were significantly associated with increased treatment failure. Retaining patients on their initial first line regimen with appropriate follow up and improving their socioeconomic status through various livelihood initiatives should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W2765168963,"Phosphorus (P) is translocated from vegetative tissues to developing seeds during senescence in annual crop plants, but the impact of this P mobilisation on photosynthesis and plant performance is poorly understood. This study investigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) flag leaf photosynthesis and P remobilisation in a hydroponic study where P was either supplied until maturity or withdrawn permanently from the nutrient solution at anthesis, 8 days after anthesis (DAA) or 16 DAA. Prior to anthesis, plants received either the minimum level of P in nutrient solution required to achieve maximum grain yield ('adequate P treatment'), or received luxury levels of P in the nutrient solution ('luxury P treatment'). Flag leaf photosynthesis was impaired at 16 DAA when P was withdrawn at anthesis or 8 DAA under adequate P supply but only when P was withdrawn at anthesis under luxury P supply. Ultimately, reduced photosynthesis did not translate into grain yield reductions. There was some evidence plants remobilised less essential P pools (e.g. Pi) or replaceable P pools (e.g. phospholipid-P) prior to remobilisation of P in pools critical to leaf function such as nucleic acid-P and cytosolic Pi. Competition for P between vegetative tissues and developing grains can impair photosynthesis when P supply is withdrawn during early grain filling. A reduction in the P sink strength of grains by genetic manipulation may enable leaves to sustain high rates of photosynthesis until the later stages of grain filling."

https://openalex.org/W2766272724,"Microtubules have long been implicated to play an integral role in metastatic disease, for which a critical step is the local invasion of tumor cells into the 3-dimensional (3D) collagen-rich stromal matrix. Here we show that cell migration of human cancer cells uses the dynamic formation of highly branched protrusions that are composed of a microtubule core surrounded by cortical actin, a cytoskeletal organization that is absent in cells on 2-dimensional (2D) substrates. Microtubule plus-end tracking protein End-binding 1 and motor protein dynein subunits light intermediate chain 2 and heavy chain 1, which do not regulate 2D migration, critically modulate 3D migration by affecting RhoA and thus regulate protrusion branching through differential assembly dynamics of microtubules. An important consequence of this observation is that the commonly used cancer drug paclitaxel is 100-fold more effective at blocking migration in a 3D matrix than on a 2D matrix. This work reveals the central role that microtubule dynamics plays in powering cell migration in a more pathologically relevant setting and suggests further testing of therapeutics targeting microtubules to mitigate migration.-Jayatilaka, H., Giri, A., Karl, M., Aifuwa, I., Trenton, N.

https://openalex.org/W2765696731,"Use of some HIV-1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) is associated with severe adverse events. However, the exact mechanisms behind their toxicity has not been fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction after chronic exposure to specific NRTIs has predominantly been assigned to mitochondrial polymerase-γ inhibition by NRTIs. However, an increasing amount of data suggests that this is not the sole mechanism. Many NRTI induced adverse events have been linked to the incurrence of oxidative stress, although the causality of events leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and their role in toxicity is unclear. In this study we show that short-term effects of first generation NRTIs, which are rarely discussed in the literature, include inhibition of oxygen consumption, decreased ATP levels and increased ROS production. Collectively these events affect fitness and longevity of C. elegans through mitohormetic signalling events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these effects can be normalized by addition of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which suggests that ROS likely influence the onset and severity of adverse events upon drug exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2766125466,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins due to an impairment of ER quality control pathways leading to the activation of a defense system, called unfolded protein response (UPR). While thyrocytes are supposed to be highly susceptible to environmental conditions that cause ER stress due to the synthesis of large amounts of secretory proteins required for thyroid hormone synthesis, systematic investigations on the effect of ER stress on expression of key genes of thyroid hormone synthesis and their transcriptional regulators are lacking. Since the aim of the ER stress-induced UPR is to restore ER homeostasis and to facilitate cell survival through transient shutdown of ribosomal protein translation, we hypothesized that the expression of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis and their transcriptional regulators, all of which are not essential for cell survival, are down-regulated in thyrocytes during ER stress, while sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are activated during ER stress in thyrocytes. Treatment of FRTL-5 thyrocytes with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (TM) dose-dependently increased the mRNA and/or protein levels of known UPR target genes, stimulated phosphorylation of the ER stress sensor protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and of the PERK target protein eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and caused splicing of the ER stress-sensitive transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP-1) (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels and/or protein levels of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (TG), their transcriptional regulators and thyrotropin (TSH) receptor and the uptake of Na125I were reduced at the highest concentration of TM tested (0.1 μg/mL; P < 0.05). Proteolytic activation of the SREBP-1c pathway was not observed in FRTL-5 cells treated with TM, whereas TM reduced proteolytic activation of the SREBP-2 pathway at 0.1 μg TM/mL (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the expression of key genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis and their critical regulators and of the TSH receptor as well as the uptake of iodide is attenuated in thyrocytes during mild ER stress. Down-regulation of NIS, TPO and TG during ER stress is likely the consequence of impaired TSH/TSHR signaling in concert with reduced expression of critical transcriptional regulators of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2765276760,"Background Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently identified class of noncoding RNAs that participate in several physiological processes. However, the expression of circRNAs in infantile hemangioma (IH) remains unknown. Methods The profile of circRNAs was assessed by microarray in four pairs of IH and adjacent skin tissues. The expression of circRNAs was validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, circRNA-microRNAs (miRNA)-mRNA networks were constructed using bioinformatics tools. Results 234 up- and 374 down- regulated circRNAs were identified in IH by microarray. Among them, the expression of two up-regulated circRNAs (hsa_circRNA_100933 and hsa_circRNA_100709) and one down-regulated circRNA (hsa_circRNA_104310) was confirmed by qRT-PCR. In addition, 3,019 miRNA response elements (MREs) of circRNAs were predicted, and two circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were constructed, including 100 and 94 target genes of hsa_circRNA_100933 and hsa_circRNA_104310, respectively. GO and pathway analysis showed that both networks participated in angiogenesis and vascular development-related biological processes. Conclusions This is the first study to reveal the profiling of circRNAs in IH and pave the way for further characterization of the role of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of IH."
https://openalex.org/W2766300021,"The Common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) is one of the most endangered mammals in Western and Central Europe. Its genetic diversity in Russia and Kazakhstan was investigated for the first time. The analysis of sequences of an mtDNA control region and cytochrome b gene revealed at least three phylogenetic lineages. Most of the species range (approximately 3 million km2), including central Russia, Crimea, the Ural region, and northern Kazakhstan), is inhabited by a single, well-supported phylogroup, E0. Phylogroup E1, previously reported from southeastern Poland and western Ukraine, was first described from Russia (Bryansk Province). E0 and E1 are sister lineages but both are monophyletic and separated by considerable genetic distance. Hamsters inhabiting Ciscaucasia represent a separate, distant phylogenetic lineage, named “Caucasus”. It is sister to the North phylogroup from Western Europe and the contemporary phylogeography for this species is discussed considering new data. These data enabled us to develop a new hypothesis to propose that in the Late Pleistocene, the continuous range of the Common hamster in the northern Mediterranean extended from the central and southern parts of modern France to the Caucasus; however, its distribution was subsequently interrupted, likely because of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2766758411,"Objectives In the context of serious or life-limiting illness, pediatric patients and their families are faced with difficult decisions surrounding appropriate resuscitation efforts in the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest. Code status orders are one way to inform end-of-life medical decision making. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the extent to which pediatric providers have knowledge of code status options and explore the association of provider role with (1) knowledge of code status options, (2) perception of timing of code status discussions, (3) perception of family receptivity to code status discussions, and (4) comfort carrying out code status discussions. Design Nurses, trainees (residents and fellows), and attending physicians from pediatric units where code status discussions typically occur completed a short survey questionnaire regarding their knowledge of code status options and perceptions surrounding code status discussions. Setting Single center, quaternary care children’s hospital. Measurements and main results 203 nurses, 31 trainees, and 29 attending physicians in 4 high-acuity pediatric units responded to the survey (N = 263, 90% response rate). Based on an objective knowledge measure, providers demonstrate poor understanding of available code status options, with only 22% of providers able to enumerate more than two of four available code status options. In contrast, provider groups self-report high levels of familiarity with available code status options, with attending physicians reporting significantly higher levels than nurses and trainees (p = 0.0125). Nurses and attending physicians show significantly different perception of code status discussion timing, with majority of nurses (63.4%) perceiving discussions as occurring “too late” or “much too late” and majority of attending physicians (55.6%) perceiving the timing as “about right” (p<0.0001). Attending physicians report significantly higher comfort having code status discussions with families than do nurses or trainees (p≤0.0001). Attending physicians and trainees perceive families as more receptive to code status discussions than nurses (p<0.0001 and p = 0.0018, respectively). Conclusions Providers have poor understanding of code status options and differ significantly in their comfort having code status discussions and their perceptions of these discussions. These findings may reflect inherent differences among providers, but may also reflect discordant visions of appropriate care and function as a potential source of moral distress. Lack of knowledge of code status options and differences in provider perceptions are likely barriers to quality communication surrounding end-of-life options."
https://openalex.org/W2765951130,"Investigating the responses of trees to the heterogeneous distribution of nutrients in soil and simultaneous presence of neighboring roots could strengthen the understanding of an influential mechanism on tree growth and provide a scientific basis for forest management. Here, we conducted two split-pot experiments to investigate the effects of nutrient heterogeneity and intraspecific competition on the fine root morphology and nutrient capture of Picea asperata. The results showed that P. asperata efficiently captured nutrients by increasing the specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) of first-and second-order roots and decreasing the tissue density of first-order roots to avoid competition for resources and space with neighboring roots. The nutrient heterogeneity and addition of fertilization did not affect the fine root morphology, but enhanced the P and K concentrations in the fine roots in the absence of a competitor. On the interaction between nutrient heterogeneity and competition, competition decreased the SRL and SRA but enhanced the capture of K under heterogeneous soil compared with under homogeneous soil. Additionally, the P concentration, but not the K concentration, was linearly correlated to root morphology in heterogeneous soil, even when competition was present. The results suggested that root morphological features were only stimulated when the soil nutrients were insufficient for plant growth and the nutrients accumulations by root were mainly affected by the soil nutrients more than the root morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2766248994,"Macrophages contribute in the initiation and progression of insulitis during type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the mechanisms governing their recruitment into the islets as well as the manner of retention and activation are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated a role for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its transmembrane receptor, CD74, in the progression of T1D. Our data indicated elevated MIF concentrations especially in long-standing T1D patients and mice. Additionally, NOD mice featured increased MIF gene expression and CD74+ leukocyte frequencies in the pancreas. We identified F4/80+ macrophages as the main immune cells in the pancreas expressing CD74 and showed that MIF antagonism of NOD macrophages prevented their activation-induced cytokine production. The physiological importance was highlighted by the fact that inhibition of MIF delayed the onset of autoimmune diabetes in two different diabetogenic T cell transfer models. Mechanistically, macrophages pre-conditioned with the MIF inhibitor featured a refractory capacity to trigger T cell activation by keeping them in a naïve state. This study underlines a possible role for MIF/CD74 signaling pathways in promoting macrophage-mediated inflammation in T1D. As therapies directed at the MIF/CD74 pathway are in clinical development, new opportunities may be proposed for arresting T1D progression."
https://openalex.org/W2767041040,"Pyrazinamide is the main driver of sterilizing effect in the standard regimen in adults and older children, and this effect is concentration-dependent. Tuberculosis patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased risk for poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes and adverse drug events. We sought to determine whether measures of systemic immune activation were related to pyrazinamide pharmacokinetics among HIV/tuberculosis patients. We conducted a prospective cohort study of pyrazinamide pharmacokinetics in HIV/tuberculosis patients in Gaborone, Botswana. Patients underwent intensive pharmacokinetic sampling before and after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, which can increase immune activation in HIV/tuberculosis. Compartmental pharmacokinetic modeling was performed to determine whether variability in systemic immune activation was related to variability in pyrazinamide pharmacokinetic parameters. Forty HIV/tuberculosis patients completed the first pharmacokinetic sampling visit, and 24 patients returned for a second visit following antiretroviral therapy initiation. The pyrazinamide plasma concentration-versus-time data were best explained by a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, and a combined additive and proportional residual error model. Pyrazinamide clearance was higher in men than women. Expression of CD38 and HLA- DR on CD8+T cells, a measure of HIV-associated immune activation, was inversely related to pyrazinamide clearance, with increasing immune activation associated with decreasing pyrazinamide clearance. Future studies should verify this finding in larger numbers of tuberculosis patients with and without HIV co-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2765566866,"The aim of this study was to show how computational models can be used to increase our understanding of the role of microRNAs in osteoarthritis (OA) using miR-140 as an example. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental results from the literature were used to create and calibrate models of gene regulatory networks in OA involving miR-140 along with key regulators such as NF-κB, SMAD3, and RUNX2. The individual models were created with the modelling standard, Systems Biology Markup Language, and integrated to examine the overall effect of miR-140 on cartilage homeostasis. Down-regulation of miR-140 may have either detrimental or protective effects for cartilage, indicating that the role of miR-140 is complex. Studies of individual networks in isolation may therefore lead to different conclusions. This indicated the need to combine the five chosen individual networks involving miR-140 into an integrated model. This model suggests that the overall effect of miR-140 is to change the response to an IL-1 stimulus from a prolonged increase in matrix degrading enzymes to a pulse-like response so that cartilage degradation is temporary. Our current model can easily be modified and extended as more experimental data become available about the role of miR-140 in OA. In addition, networks of other microRNAs that are important in OA could be incorporated. A fully integrated model could not only aid our understanding of the mechanisms of microRNAs in ageing cartilage but could also provide a useful tool to investigate the effect of potential interventions to prevent cartilage loss."
https://openalex.org/W2765552618,"Background Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) might be associated with an increased risk of secondary osteoarthritis. However, there is a lack of studies assessing its impact on osteoarthritis-related surgery. The aim of this secondary cohort study was to investigate the risk of symptomatic osteoarthritis and osteoarthritis-related surgery, including total hip replacement surgery (THRS) and total knee replacement surgery (TKRS) in patients with AS. Methods Using the Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 3,462 patients with AS between 2000 and 2012. A comparison cohort was assembled consisting of five patients without AS, based on frequency matching for sex, 10-year age interval, and index year, for each patient with AS. Both groups were followed until diagnosis of the study outcomes or the end of the follow-up period. Results Male patients with AS exhibited a significantly higher incidence of osteoarthritis (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.43; P < 0.001), THRS (adjusted IRR 12.59; P < 0.001), and TKRS (adjusted IRR 1.89; P = 0.036). Moreover, analyses stratified by age group (20–39 years versus 40–80 years) indicated a high IRR (adjusted IRR 27.66; P <0.001) for THRS among younger patients with AS. Conclusions Male patients with AS had a significant higher risk of developing osteoarthritis, and receiving THRS and TKRS. Young patients with AS also showed a significant higher risk of receiving THRS."
https://openalex.org/W2765672741,"Background Social networks influence health behavior, including tobacco use and cessation. To date, little is known about whether and how the networks of online smokers and non-smokers may differ, or the potential implications of such differences with regards to intervention efforts. Understanding how social networks vary by smoking status could inform public health efforts to accelerate cessation or slow the adoption of tobacco use. Objectives These secondary analyses explore the structure of ego networks of both smokers and non-smokers collected as part of a randomized control trial conducted within Facebook. Methods During the trial, a total of 14,010 individuals installed a Facebook smoking cessation app: 9,042 smokers who were randomized in the trial, an additional 2,881 smokers who did not meet full eligibility criteria, and 2,087 non-smokers. The ego network for all individuals was constructed out to second-degree connections. Four kinds of networks were constructed: friendship, family, photo, and group networks. From these networks we measured edges, isolates, density, mean betweenness, transitivity, and mean closeness. We also measured diameter, clustering, and modularity without ego and isolates. Logistic regressions were performed with smoking status as the response and network metrics as the primary independent variables and demographics and Facebook utilization metrics as covariates. Results The four networks had different characteristics, indicated by different multicollinearity issues and by logistic regression output. Among Friendship networks, the odds of smoking were higher in networks with lower betweenness (p = 0.00), lower transitivity (p = 0.00), and larger diameter (p = 0.00). Among Family networks, the odds of smoking were higher in networks with more vertices (p = .01), less transitivity (p = .04), and fewer isolates (p = .01). Among Photo networks, none of the network metrics were predictive of smoking status. Among Group networks, the odds of smoking were higher when diameter was smaller (p = .04). Together, these findings suggested that compared to non-smokers, smokers in this sample had less connected, more dispersed Facebook Friendship networks; larger but more fractured Family networks with fewer isolates; more compact Group networks; and Photo networks that were similar in network structure to those of non-smokers. Conclusions This study illustrates the importance of examining structural differences in online social networks as a critical component for network-based interventions and lays the foundation for future research that examines the ways that social networks differ based on individual health behavior. Interventions that seek to target the behavior of individuals in the context of their social environment would be well served to understand social network structures of participants."
https://openalex.org/W2765908296,"Aim Serum high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a proinflammatory molecule that could potentially serve as a biomarker for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to its correlation with degree of liver fibrosis. The aim of the current study was to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between serum HMGB1 levels and liver histology in adults and children with NAFLD participating in two large randomized controlled trials. Methods Serum HMGB1 levels were measured at various time points in adults and children with NAFLD, who participated in PIVENS and TONIC clinical trials respectively. PIVENS trial compared vitamin E or pioglitazone to placebo in adults whereas TONIC trial compared vitamin E or metformin to placebo in children. Participants had liver biopsies at baseline and the end of treatment (96 weeks), and liver histology was reviewed by a central committee of study pathologists. Results In the cross-sectional analyses (n = 205 for PIVENS and 109 for TONIC), there was no significant relationship between serum HMGB1 levels and histological features such as steatosis, ballooning, inflammation, fibrosis, or presence of steatohepatitis in either adults or children. Serum HMGB1 levels did not change significantly during treatment either with placebo, vitamin E therapy (P = 0.81) or pioglitazone (P = 0.09) in the PIVENS trial. Similarly, serum HMGB1 levels did not change significantly during treatment either with placebo, metformin (P = 0.15) or vitamin E (P = 0.23) in the TONIC trial. In the longitudinal analyses (n = 105 for PIVENS and 109 for TONIC), changes in serum HMGB1 levels did not correlate with histologic improvement or resolution of NASH in either adults or children. There was no relationship between serum HMGB1 and ALT levels in either adults or children with NAFLD. Conclusion Serum HMGB1 levels were not associated with histological severity or treatment response in either children or adults with NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2766364756,"Leishmania major is the causative agent of the neglected tropical disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis. In the mouse, protective immunity to Leishmania is associated with inflammatory responses. Here, we assess the dynamics of the inflammatory responses at the lesion site during experimental long-term, low-dose intradermal infection of the ear, employing noninvasive imaging and genetically modified L. major. Significant infiltrates of neutrophils and monocytes occurred at 1-4 d and 2-4 wk, whereas dermal macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) numbers were only slightly elevated in the first days. Quantitative whole-body bioluminescence imaging of myeloperoxidase activity and the quantification of parasite loads indicated that the Leishmania virulence factor, inhibitor of serine peptidase 2 (ISP2), is required to modulate phagocyte activation and is important for parasite survival at the infection site. ISP2 played a role in the control of monocyte, monocyte-derived macrophage, and monocyte-derived DC (moDC) influx, and was required to reduce iNOS expression in monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and dermal DCs; the expression of CD80 in moDCs; and levels of IFN-γ in situ. Our findings indicate that the increased survival of L. major in the dermis during acute infection is associated with the down-regulation of inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived cells via ISP2.—Goundry, A., Romano, A., Lima, A.

https://openalex.org/W2766390347,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been found to form heterodimers and modulate or fine-tune the functions of GPCRs. However, the involvement of GPCR heterodimerization and its functional consequences in gonadal tissues, including granulosa cells, have been poorly investigated, mainly due to the lack of efficient method for identification of novel GPCR heterodimers. In this paper, we identified a novel GPCR heterodimer between prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor 2 (EP2) and calcitonin (CT) receptor (CTR). High-resolution liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of protease-digested EP2-coimmunoprecipitates detected protein fragments of CTR in an ovarian granulosa cell line, OV3121. Western blotting of EP2- and CTR-coimmunoprecipitates detected a specific band for EP2-CTR heterodimer. Specific heterodimerization between EP2 and CTR was also observed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis in HEK293MSR cells expressing cyan- and yellow-fluorescent protein-fused EP2 and CTR, respectively. Collectively, these results provided evidence for heterodimerization between EP2 and CTR. Moreover, Ca2+ mobilization by CT was approximately 40% less potent in HEK293MSR cells expressing an EP2-CTR heterodimer, whereas cAMP production by EP2 or CT was not significantly altered compared with cells expressing EP2- or CTR alone. These functional analyses verified that CTR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization is specifically decreased via heterodimerization with EP2. Altogether, the present study suggests that a novel GPCR heterodimer, EP2-CTR, is involved in some functional regulation, and paves the way for investigation of novel biological roles of CTR and EP2 in various tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2766620140,"RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays are methods for measuring gene expression across the entire transcriptome. Recent advances have made these techniques practical and affordable for essentially any laboratory with experience in molecular biology. A variety of computational methods have been developed to decrease the amount of bioinformatics expertise necessary to analyze these data. Nevertheless, many barriers persist which discourage new labs from using functional genomics approaches. Since high-quality gene expression studies have enduring value as resources to the entire research community, it is of particular importance that small labs have the capacity to share their analyzed datasets with the research community. Here we introduce ExpressionDB, an open source platform for visualizing RNA-seq and microarray data accommodating virtually any number of different samples. ExpressionDB is based on Shiny, a customizable web application which allows data sharing locally and online with customizable code written in R. ExpressionDB allows intuitive searches based on gene symbols, descriptions, or gene ontology terms, and it includes tools for dynamically filtering results based on expression level, fold change, and false-discovery rates. Built-in visualization tools include heatmaps, volcano plots, and principal component analysis, ensuring streamlined and consistent visualization to all users. All of the scripts for building an ExpressionDB with user-supplied data are freely available on GitHub, and the Creative Commons license allows fully open customization by end-users. We estimate that a demo database can be created in under one hour with minimal programming experience, and that a new database with user-supplied expression data can be completed and online in less than one day."

https://openalex.org/W2767200264,"Others’ perceptual judgments tend to have strong effects on our own, and can improve perceptual judgments when task partners engage in communication. The present study investigated whether individuals benefit from others’ perceptual judgments in indirect interactions, where outcomes of individual decisions can be observed in a shared environment. Participants located a target in a 2D projection of a 3D container either from two complementary viewpoints (Experiment 1), or from a single viewpoint (Experiment 2). Uncertainty about the target location was high on the front-back dimension and low on the left-right dimension. The results showed that pairs of participants benefitted from taking turns in providing judgments. When each member of the pair had access to one complementary perspective, the pair achieved the same level of accuracy as when the two individuals had access to both complimentary perspectives and better performance than when the two individuals had access to only one perspective. These findings demonstrate the important role of a shared environment for successful integration of perceptual information while highlighting limitations in assigning appropriate weights to others’ judgments."

Although biliary drainage can resolve obstructive jaundice, signs of obstruction may not be evident. This study evaluated the role of endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with advanced HCC and obstructive jaundice.From 2010 to 2015, 74 patients underwent endoscopic biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice due to advanced HCC. Jaundice resolution was defined as complete response and total bilirubin concentration below 3 mg/dl.The technical success rate in the 74 patients was 92.1% (70/76). Of the 70 patients who underwent successful biliary drainage, 48 (68.6%) and 22 (31.4%) were Child-Pugh classes B and C, respectively, and 10 (14.3%) and 60 (85.7%) were BCLC stages B and C, respectively. Intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) dilatation was observed in 35 patients (50%). After drainage, the complete response rate was 35.7% (25/70). The mean time to resolution was 17.4 ±8.5 days. However, jaundice was re-aggravated in 74.3% (15/25) after a mean 103.5 ±96.4 days. Multivariate analysis showed that the absence of ascites, presence of IHD dilatation, normal range of prothrombin time, and lower MELD score were significantly associated with complete response. The overall survival rate was 15.7% (11/70) and the median survival time is 28 days (95% confidence interval 2.6-563 days). Complete response and HCC treatment after drainage were significantly associated with survival.Effective endoscopic biliary drainage is an important palliative treatment in patients with advanced HCC and obstructive jaundice, especially those with IHD dilatation and preserved liver function, as determined by ascites, prothrombin time, and MELD score."
https://openalex.org/W2765199108,"Objective Two separate and distinctive skills are necessary to find prey: Detection of its presence and determination of its location. Surface microscopy of the dentary of albertosaurines revealed a previously undescribed sensory modification, as will be described here. While dentary “foramina” were previously thought to contain tactile sensory organs, the potential function of this theropod modification as a unique localizing system is explored in this study. Method Dentary surface perforations were examined by surface epi-illumination microscopy in tyrannosaurine and albertosaurine dinosaurs to characterize their anatomy. Fish lateral lines were examined as potentially comparable structures. Result In contrast to the subsurface vascular bifurcation noted in tyrannosaurines (which lack a lateral dentary surface groove), the area subjacent to the apertures in albertosaurine grooves has the appearance of an expanded chamber. That appearance seemed to be indistinguishable from the lateral line of fish. Conclusion Dentary groove apertures in certain tyrannosaurid lines (specifically albertosaurines) not only have a unique appearance, but one with significant functional and behavior implications. The appearance of the perforations in the dentary groove of albertosaurines mirrors that previously noted only with specialized neurologic structures accommodating derived sensory functions, as seen in the lateral line of fish. The possibility that this specialized morphology could also represent a unique function in albertosaurine theropods for interacting with the environment or facilitating prey acquisition cannot be ignored. It is suggested that these expanded chambers function in perceiving and aligning the body relative to the direction of wind, perhaps a Cretaceous analogue of the contemporary midwestern weathervane."

Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were fed a basal diet, without (C) or with 0.5% clofibrate (CF, a PPARα agonist) throughout pregnancy. After parturition, only male offspring were used; all suckled their mothers (who were eating the C diet) and after weaning, they ate a standard chow diet for 4 wk, followed by a high-fat diet (HFD) for 5 wk. Administration of CF up-regulated serum concentrations and hepatic expression of FGF21 in fetuses, with a return to basal levels after CF withdrawal. At postnatal day 84 (P84), CF-offspring had significantly higher expression of thermogenic genes (Ucp1, Cidea, Ppara Ppargc1a, Cpt1b) and UCP1 protein levels in response to HFD in inguinal fat, but not in retroperitoneal (combined with perirenal) or epididymal fat. Based on UCP1 levels in inguinal fat on P7, P14, and P21, appearance of the transient brown-adipocyte phenotype seemed to be hastened by CF exposure. We concluded that giving CF to pregnant mice programmed greater HFD-induced WAT browning in subcutaneous, but not in visceral fat, in their male offspring at adulthood."

Although previous studies have suggested that the CKD-EPI formula is appropriate to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in HIV-positive adults with normal kidney function, the optimal way to estimate GFR in those with Stage 3 chronic kidney disease is not known. Moreover, the impact of muscle mass on creatinine level and GFR estimation is unknown.Our study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of different diagnostic tests available compared to the gold standard measurement of GFR. A group of 44 HIV-1 patients with an estimated GFR between 60 and 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 were included in a single-center cross-sectional study. Serum creatinine and cystatin C were measured. GFR was estimated using Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD, sMDRD, CKD-EPI, CKD-EPIcyst, and CKD-EPIcyst/creat formulae and was measured using isotopic Chrome51 EDTA clearance. Bone density and muscle mass were measured by DXA scan.Mean age was 62±10 years. Mean BMI was 23±4 kg/m2. Prevalence of diabetes was 30% and of hypertension was 47%. Viral load was <40 copies/ml for 90% of the patients, and mean CD4 count was 446±191 cells/mm3. Mean measured GFR was 63.4±16.5 ml/min/1.73 m2. All formulae under-estimated GFR. The best relative precision and accuracy were provided by the CKP-EPI formula. sMDRD, CKD-EPIcyst, and CKD-EPIcyst/creat performed worse than the CKD-EPI formula. Body composition did not significantly influence accuracy or precision of GFR estimation.In HIV-infected patients in stable immunovirologic conditions with CKD stage 3 and high prevalence of metabolic associated conditions, the CKD-EPI formula performed best, although all formulae under estimate GFR."
