https://openalex.org/W1985621639,"Genomes are organized into high-level three-dimensional structures, and DNA elements separated by long genomic distances can in principle interact functionally. Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements distant from gene promoters. Although distal binding sites have been shown to regulate transcription by long-range chromatin interactions at a few loci, chromatin interactions and their impact on transcription regulation have not been investigated in a genome-wide manner. Here we describe the development of a new strategy, chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) for the de novo detection of global chromatin interactions, with which we have comprehensively mapped the chromatin interaction network bound by oestrogen receptor α (ER-α) in the human genome. We found that most high-confidence remote ER-α-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters through long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-α functions by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation. We propose that chromatin interactions constitute a primary mechanism for regulating transcription in mammalian genomes. Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements that are distant from gene promoters, and such distal binding sites are thought to regulate transcription through long-range chromatin interactions. In order to study how this remote control is organized in a complex genome, Fullwood et al. use a technique termed ChIA-PET (chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing) to detect and map the chromatin interaction network mediated by oestrogen receptor α (ER-α) in human cancer cells. In the resulting global chromatin interactome map, most high-confidence remote ER-α-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters through long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-α functions by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation. Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements that are distant from gene promoters. These distal binding sites are thought to regulate transcription through long-range chromatin interactions, but, until now, the impact of chromatin interactions on transcription regulation has not been investigated in a genome-wide manner. A new strategy — chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing — is now described for the de novo detection of global chromatin interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1989709650,"Recent years have seen tremendous progress in creating complex atomic many-body quantum systems. One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom. The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas 'microscope' that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantum information systems based on ultracold atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2033106764,"The activation of innate immune responses by nucleic acids is crucial to protective and pathological immunities and is mediated by the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic receptors. However, it remains unknown whether a mechanism exists that integrates these nucleic-acid-sensing systems. Here we show that high-mobility group box (HMGB) proteins 1, 2 and 3 function as universal sentinels for nucleic acids. HMGBs bind to all immunogenic nucleic acids examined with a correlation between affinity and immunogenic potential. Hmgb1(-/-) and Hmgb2(-/-) mouse cells are defective in type-I interferon and inflammatory cytokine induction by DNA or RNA targeted to activate the cytosolic nucleic-acid-sensing receptors; cells in which the expression of all three HMGBs is suppressed show a more profound defect, accompanied by impaired activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. The absence of HMGBs also severely impairs the activation of TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 by their cognate nucleic acids. Our results therefore indicate a hierarchy in the nucleic-acid-mediated activation of immune responses, wherein the selective activation of nucleic-acid-sensing receptors is contingent on the more promiscuous sensing of nucleic acids by HMGBs. These findings may have implications for understanding the evolution of the innate immune system and for the treatment of immunological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2085850813,"Bet hedging-stochastic switching between phenotypic states-is a canonical example of an evolutionary adaptation that facilitates persistence in the face of fluctuating environmental conditions. Although bet hedging is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, direct evidence for an adaptive origin of this behaviour is lacking. Here we report the de novo evolution of bet hedging in experimental bacterial populations. Bacteria were subjected to an environment that continually favoured new phenotypic states. Initially, our regime drove the successive evolution of novel phenotypes by mutation and selection; however, in two (of 12) replicates this trend was broken by the evolution of bet-hedging genotypes that persisted because of rapid stochastic phenotype switching. Genome re-sequencing of one of these switching types revealed nine mutations that distinguished it from the ancestor. The final mutation was both necessary and sufficient for rapid phenotype switching; nonetheless, the evolution of bet hedging was contingent upon earlier mutations that altered the relative fitness effect of the final mutation. These findings capture the adaptive evolution of bet hedging in the simplest of organisms, and suggest that risk-spreading strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions to life in fluctuating environments."

https://openalex.org/W1994887179,"Many metalloproteins — proteins that contain metal atoms in their active sites — are crucial for biological reactions involving electron transfer. Marshall et al. now demonstrate that it is possible to tune the reduction potential of a single cupredoxin molecule — the arsenate reductase known as azurin — to well beyond the natural range. This is achieved by changing key amino acids near, or distal to, the metal binding site. The hope is that the lessons learned from this work, and future studies, could be used to design non-natural photosynthetic centres or artificial fuel cell catalysts for energy conversion. Redox processes, which are at the heart of numerous functions in chemistry and biology, are accomplished in nature by only a limited number of redox-active agents. A long-standing issue is how redox potentials are fine-tuned over a broad range with little change to the redox-active site or electron-transfer properties. Here it is shown that two important secondary coordination sphere interactions, hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding, are capable of tuning the reduction potential of a single cupredoxin over a 700 mV range. Redox processes are at the heart of numerous functions in chemistry and biology, from long-range electron transfer in photosynthesis and respiration to catalysis in industrial and fuel cell research. These functions are accomplished in nature by only a limited number of redox-active agents. A long-standing issue in these fields is how redox potentials are fine-tuned over a broad range with little change to the redox-active site or electron-transfer properties. Resolving this issue will not only advance our fundamental understanding of the roles of long-range, non-covalent interactions in redox processes, but also allow for design of redox-active proteins having tailor-made redox potentials for applications such as artificial photosynthetic centres1,2 or fuel cell catalysts3 for energy conversion. Here we show that two important secondary coordination sphere interactions, hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding, are capable of tuning the reduction potential of the cupredoxin azurin over a 700 mV range, surpassing the highest and lowest reduction potentials reported for any mononuclear cupredoxin, without perturbing the metal binding site beyond what is typical for the cupredoxin family of proteins. We also demonstrate that the effects of individual structural features are additive and that redox potential tuning of azurin is now predictable across the full range of cupredoxin potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2038946560,"The surface of hot neutron stars is covered by a thin atmosphere. If there is accretion after neutron star formation, the atmosphere could be composed of light elements (H or He); if no accretion takes place or if thermonuclear reactions occur after accretion, heavy elements (for example, Fe) are expected. Despite detailed searches, observations have been unable to confirm the atmospheric composition of isolated neutron stars. Here we report an analysis of archival observations of the compact X-ray source in the centre of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. We show that a carbon atmosphere neutron star (with low magnetic field) produces a good fit to the spectrum. Our emission model, in contrast with others, implies an emission size consistent with theoretical predictions for the radius of neutron stars. This result suggests that there is nuclear burning in the surface layers and also identifies the compact source as a very young (~330-year-old) neutron star."
https://openalex.org/W2079481706,"Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) at Ser-129 is a hallmark of Parkinson disease and related synucleinopathies. However, the identity of the natural kinases and phosphatases responsible for regulating alpha-syn phosphorylation remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that three closely related members of the human Polo-like kinase (PLK) family (PLK1, PLK2, and PLK3) phosphorylate alpha-syn and beta-syn specifically at Ser-129 and Ser-118, respectively. Unlike other kinases reported to partially phosphorylate alpha-syn at Ser-129 in vitro, phosphorylation by PLK2 and PLK3 is quantitative (>95% conversion). Only PLK1 and PLK3 phosphorylate beta-syn at Ser-118, whereas no phosphorylation of gamma-syn was detected by any of the four PLKs (PLK1 to -4). PLK-mediated phosphorylation was greatly reduced in an isolated C-terminal fragment (residues 103-140) of alpha-syn, suggesting substrate recognition via the N-terminal repeats and/or the non-amyloid component domain of alpha-syn. PLKs specifically co-localized with phosphorylated Ser-129 (Ser(P)-129) alpha-syn in various subcellular compartments (cytoplasm, nucleus, and membranes) of mammalian cell lines and primary neurons as well as in alpha-syn transgenic mice, especially cortical brain areas involved in synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, we report that the levels of PLK2 are significantly increased in brains of Alzheimer disease and Lewy body disease patients. Taken together, these results provide biochemical and in vivo evidence of alpha-syn and beta-syn phosphorylation by specific PLKs. Our results suggest a need for further studies to elucidate the potential role of PLK-syn interactions in the normal biology of these proteins as well as their involvement in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2143099403,"Cerebral selenium (Se) deficiency is associated with neurological phenotypes including seizures and ataxia. We wanted to define whether neurons require selenoprotein expression and which selenoproteins are most important, and explore the possible pathomechanism. Therefore, we abrogated the expression of all selenoproteins in neurons by genetic inactivation of the tRNA[Ser]Sec gene. Cerebral expression of selenoproteins was significantly diminished in the mutants, and histological analysis revealed progressive neurodegeneration. Developing interneurons failed to specifically express parvalbumin (PV) in the mutants. Electrophysiological recordings, before overt cell death, showed normal excitatory transmission, but revealed spontaneous epileptiform activity consistent with seizures in the mutants. In developing cortical neuron cultures, the number of PV+ neurons was reduced on combined Se and vitamin E deprivation, while other markers, such as calretinin (CR) and GAD67, remained unaffected. Because of the synergism between Se and vitamin E, we analyzed mice lacking neuronal expression of the Se-dependent enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4). Although the number of CR+ interneurons remained normal in Gpx4-mutant mice, the number of PV+ interneurons was reduced. Since these mice similarly exhibit seizures and ataxia, we conclude that GPx4 is a selenoenzyme modulating interneuron function and PV expression. Cerebral SE deficiency may thus act via reduced GPx4 expression.—Wirth, E. K., Conrad, M., Winterer, J., Wozny, C., Carlson, B. A., Roth, S., Schmitz, D., Bornkamm, G.

https://openalex.org/W2079497788,"The KZN strain family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a highly virulent strain endemic to the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, which has recently experienced an outbreak of extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis. To investigate the causes and evolution of drug-resistance, we determined the DNA sequences of several clinical isolates - one drug-susceptible, one multi-drug resistant, and nine extensively drug-resistant - using whole-genome sequencing. Analysis of polymorphisms among the strains is consistent with the drug-susceptibility profiles, in that well-known mutations are observed that are correlated with resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, kanamycin, ofloxacin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. However, the mutations responsible for rifampicin resistance in rpoB and pyrazinamide in pncA are in different nucleotide positions in the multi-drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains, clearly showing that they acquired these mutations independently, and that the XDR strain could not have evolved directly from the MDR strain (though it could have arisen from another similar MDR strain). Sequencing of eight additional XDR strains from other areas of KwaZulu-Natal shows that they have identical drug resistant mutations to the first one sequenced, including the same polymorphisms at sites associated with drug resistance, supporting the theory that this represents a case of clonal expansion."
https://openalex.org/W1968810092,"Background Commitment in embryonic stem cells is often depicted as a binary choice between alternate cell states, pluripotency and specification to a particular germ layer or extraembryonic lineage. However, close examination of human ES cell cultures has revealed significant heterogeneity in the stem cell compartment. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated subpopulations of embryonic stem cells using surface markers, then examined their expression of pluripotency genes and lineage specific transcription factors at the single cell level, and tested their ability to regenerate colonies of stem cells. Transcript analysis of single embryonic stem cells showed that there is a gradient and a hierarchy of expression of pluripotency genes in the population. Even cells at the top of the hierarchy generally express only a subset of the stem cell genes studied. Many cells co-express pluripotency and lineage specific genes. Cells along the continuum show a progressively decreasing likelihood of self renewal as their expression of stem cell surface markers and pluripotency genes wanes. Most cells that are positive for stem cell surface markers express Oct-4, but only those towards the top of the hierarchy express the nodal receptor TDGF-1 and the growth factor GDF3. Significance These findings on gene expression in single embryonic stem cells are in concert with recent studies of early mammalian development, which reveal molecular heterogeneity and a stochasticity of gene expression in blastomeres. Our work indicates that only a small fraction of the population resides at the top of the hierarchy, that lineage priming (co-expression of stem cell and lineage specific genes) characterizes pluripotent stem cell populations, and that extrinsic signaling pathways are upstream of transcription factor networks that control pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2091557492,"Background Viroids are circular, highly structured, non-protein-coding RNAs that, usurping cellular enzymes and escaping host defense mechanisms, are able to replicate and move through infected plants. Similarly to viruses, viroid infections are associated with the accumulation of viroid-derived 21–24 nt small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) with the typical features of the small interfering RNAs characteristic of RNA silencing, a sequence-specific mechanism involved in defense against invading nucleic acids and in regulation of gene expression in most eukaryotic organisms. Methodology/Principal Findings To gain further insights on the genesis and possible role of vd-sRNAs in plant-viroid interaction, sRNAs isolated from Vitis vinifera infected by Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) and Grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1 (GYSVd1) were sequenced by the high-throughput platform Solexa-Illumina, and the vd-sRNAs were analyzed. The large majority of HSVd- and GYSVd1-sRNAs derived from a few specific regions (hotspots) of the genomic (+) and (−) viroid RNAs, with a prevalence of those from the (−) strands of both viroids. When grouped according to their sizes, vd-sRNAs always assumed a distribution with prominent 21-, 22- and 24-nt peaks, which, interestingly, mapped at the same hotspots. Conclusions/Significance These findings show that different Dicer-like enzymes (DCLs) target viroid RNAs, preferentially accessing to the same viroid domains. Interestingly, our results also suggest that viroid RNAs may interact with host enzymes involved in the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, indicating more complex scenarios than previously thought for both vd-sRNAs genesis and possible interference with host gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2137867748,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons and atrophy of skeletal muscle. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene are linked to 20% cases of inherited ALS. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenic process, but how it contributes to muscle degeneration of ALS is not known. Here we identify a specific deficit in the cellular physiology of skeletal muscle derived from an ALS mouse model (G93A) with transgenic overexpression of the human SOD1(G93A) mutant. The G93A skeletal muscle fibers display localized loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential in fiber segments near the neuromuscular junction. These defects occur in young G93A mice prior to disease onset. Fiber segments with depolarized mitochondria show greater osmotic stress-induced Ca(2+) release activity, which can include propagating Ca(2+) waves. These Ca(2+) waves are confined to regions of depolarized mitochondria and stop propagating shortly upon entering the regions of normal, polarized mitochondria. Uncoupling of mitochondrial membrane potential with FCCP or inhibition of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake by Ru360 lead to cell-wide propagation of such Ca(2+) release events. Our data reveal that mitochondria regulate Ca(2+) signaling in skeletal muscle, and loss of this capacity may contribute to the progression of muscle atrophy in ALS."

We aimed to evaluate the relevance of MRZR to predict conversion of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to MS, and to compare it to oligoclonal bands (OCB) and MRI.MRZR was determined in a prospective study over 2 years including 40 patients that remained CIS over follow-up (CIS-CIS) and 49 patients that developed MS (CIS-RRMS) using ELISA. Using logistic regression, a score (MRZS) balancing the predictive value of the antibody indices included in MRZR was defined (9 points measles, 8 points rubella, 1 point varicella zoster, cutpoint: sum of scores greater 10). MRZR and MRZS were significantly more frequent in CIS-RRMS as compared to CIS-CIS (p=0.04 and p=0.02). MRZS showed the best positive predictive value (PPV) of all parameters investigated (79%, 95%-CI: 54-94%), which could be further increased by combination with MRI (91%, 95%-CI: 59-99%).Our data indicate the relevance of MRZR to predict conversion to MS. It furthermore shows the importance of weighting the different antibody indices included in MRZR and suggest that patients with positive MRZR are candidates for an early begin of immunomodulatory therapy."

Autophagy is a starvation-induced response that mediates the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components in the lysosome/vacuole (1Seglen P.O. Bohley P.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, autophagy plays a crucial role in fundamental biological processes such as intracellular clearance, differentiation, development, programmed cell death, and antigen representation, and autophagy dysfunction is associated with severe diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancers (3Mizushima N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2861-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). In autophagy, a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome sequesters a portion of the cytoplasm and fuses with the lysosome/vacuole to deliver its inner contents into the organelle lumen. The autophagosome-formation step requires at least 18 Atg proteins (4Nakatogawa H. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar), among which eight constitute two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the Atg12 and Atg8 systems (5Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In the Atg12 system, Atg12 is covalently linked to Atg5 by sequential reactions catalyzed by Atg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and Atg10 (an E2-like enzyme) (6Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y.

The Atg5 noncovalently interacts with the N-terminal domain of Atg16, but Atg12-Atg5 conjugation is not required for this process (8Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Because Atg16 self-assembles through the predicted coiled-coil motif at the C-terminal region (8Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 is considered to behave like a large protein complex and has been estimated by gel-filtration chromatography to be 350 kDa (9Kuma A.

The Atg12 and Atg8 systems are well conserved from yeasts to mammals, although the sequence similarity of Atg16 with a mammalian Atg16 counterpart, Atg16L, is low. Similarly with yeast Atg16, mammalian Atg16L was shown to form a large protein complex with mammalian Atg12-Atg5 conjugates (11Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T.

Intriguingly, these studies showed that both Atg12 and Atg5 are ubiquitin-fold proteins. However, the structure of the predicted coiled-coil motif (residues 58–123) of Atg16, essential for the formation of the multimeric Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex (9Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N.

Further, structure-based mutational analyses suggested that the conserved surface residues of Atg16 in CCD are critical for autophagy. coiled-coil domain alkaline phosphatase. Expression and purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg16CCD as well as the construction of the expression vector of Atg16CCD were described elsewhere (19Fujioka Y. Noda N.N. Matsushita M. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The expression vectors of glutathione S-transferase-fused Atg16 and its mutants were constructed as follows. The full-length S. cerevisiae ATG16 gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). Mutations leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. All of the constructs were sequenced to confirm the identities and were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. After cell lysis, glutathione S-transferase-fused Atg16 and its mutants were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare), followed by excision of glutathione S-transferase from the proteins with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). The proteins were again applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column to remove the excised glutathione S-transferase. Further purification was performed using a Superdex200 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 500 mm NaCl. To express the Atg5·Atg16 complex, the full-length of S. cerevisiae Atg5 was inserted into a pHT1 vector and the full-length of S. cerevisiae Atg16 was inserted into a pET-11a vector (Novagen). The Atg16 was coexpressed with N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Atg5 in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). After cell lysis, Atg5 was purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Throughout the purification steps, Atg16 comigrated with Atg5, indicating that Atg16 forms a stable complex with Atg5. After affinity chromatography, the protein complexes were purified on a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare) eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 150 mm NaCl. Further purification was performed using a HiTrap DEAE FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and the purified product was eluted with a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Final purification was carried out on a HiPrep desalting column (GE Healthcare) eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 500 mm NaCl. Crystallization of native and L103M mutant of Atg16CCD were performed as described previously (19Fujioka Y. Noda N.N. Matsushita M. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Crystallization of full-length Atg16 D101A/E102A mutant was performed by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. Drops of 10 mg ml−1 Atg16 D101A/E102A in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, and 500 mm NaCl were mixed with equal amounts of reservoir solution consisting of 0.5 m CaCl2, 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.6, and equilibrated against 100 μl of the same reservoir solution by vapor diffusion. Crystals, 0.50 × 0.25 × 0.25 mm, were obtained within a week. Diffraction data of native Atg16CCD, selenomethionine-labeled Atg16CCD L103M mutant as well as full-length Atg16 D101A/E102A mutant were collected using a Rayonix MX-225 charge-coupled device detector at the SPring-8 beamline BL41XU. Because diffractions in the lower resolution shell were not good for native Atg16CCD, the diffraction data were merged with those collected using a RAXIS-VII imaging plate detector and an in-house CuKα x-ray generator (Rigaku). All diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The initial phasing was performed by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using the peak data of the selenomethionine-labeled Atg16CCD L103M crystal. After identifying six selenium sites and calculating the initial phases using the SOLVE program (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar), density modification and automated model building were performed using the RESOLVE program (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Further model building was performed manually using the COOT program (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar), and crystallographic refinement was performed using the Crystallography and NMR system software (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The structure of full-length Atg16 D101E102A mutant was determined by the molecular replacement method using CNS software, for which the Atg16CCD structure was used as a search model. The significance of the conserved amino acids in Atg16CCD in vivo was examined as follows. Point mutations were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pRS316- or pRS426-based plasmids containing the ATG16-myc gene as templates. Successful introduction of the point mutations was confirmed by sequencing. These plasmids were introduced into Δatg16::LEU2 cells on a SEY6210 background (MATα leu2 ura3 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2), and SEY6210 Δatg16::LEU2 cells expressing Atg16 mutants were cultured in synthetic defined medium + casamino acids + AdeTrp medium to logarithmic phase and then transferred to synthetic defined (-N) medium. After culture for 4.5 h in synthetic defined (-N) medium, cells were collected. The lysates were prepared by breaking cells with glass beads in 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgSO4, 10 μm ZnSO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Using the lysates, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay was performed in the manner described in previous studies (25Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 26Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the lysates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were separated by urea-SDS-PAGE (15Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), followed by immunoblotting using anti-aminopeptidase I (anti-Ape1) or anti-Atg16 antibodies. Signals were detected using an ECL system (GE Healthcare) with a LAS4000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujifilm). Sedimentation equilibrium studies were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-I equipped with absorbance optics. Concentrations of the loaded Atg16 were 0.45, 0.75, and 1.50 mg ml−1, and for the Atg5·Atg16 complex sample 0.13, 0.21, 0.42 mg ml−1, in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.5 and 500 mm NaCl, 110 μl of the protein samples and 130 μl of the reference buffer were loaded in a six-channel centerpiece. The Atg16 was centrifuged at rotor speeds of 12,000, 16,000, and 20,000 rpm at 293 K, and the Atg5·Atg16 complex at rotor speeds of 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 rpm, also at 293 K. The absorbance profiles were acquired at a wavelength of 280 nm. After 22 h of centrifugation, the absorbance profiles were compared at 2-h intervals to ensure that the sedimentation equilibrium was reached. Data analysis was carried out using the Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I software, version 4.1 (Beckman Corlter, Inc.) based on the Origin software (Microcal, Inc.). Atg16 is comprised of the N-terminal Atg5-binding domain and the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1A). In the case of mammalian Atg16L1, the WD40 domain is attached to the C terminus of the coiled-coil domain. S. cerevisiae Atg16 has been suggested to contain a coiled-coil motif at the C-terminal region (residues 58–123) (9Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Various lengths of the Atg16 construct containing this motif were applied to crystallization and a crystal for the fragment (residues 50–123) was obtained. This construct will be referred to as Atg16CCD hereafter. The crystal structure of Atg16CCD was refined against 2.5 Å data to an R-factor of 0.272 and a free R-factor of 0.299 (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsAtg16CCD SeMetAtg16CCD nativeAtg16FData collection statistics X-ray sourceBL41XUBL41XU + CuKαBL41XU Wavelength (Å)0.97910.9791 / 1.54180.9789 Space groupP43212P43212P6222 Cell parameters (Å)a = 127.3, c = 77.6a = 127.9, c = 77.8a = 114.2, c = 156.3 Molecules/asymmetric unit662 Resolution range (Å)50-2.5050-2.4550-2.80 Outer shell (Å)2.59-2.502.54-2.452.90-2.80 Observed reflections640,275322,750199,435 Unique reflections42,10124,02815,085 Completeness (%)99.8 (99.9)98.9 (100.0)97.5 (81.0) Rmerge (I)0.054 (0.406)0.064 (0.310)0.077 (0.300)Phasing statistics Resolution range (Å)50-2.6 No. of Se sites6 Figure of merit (after solve)0.33 Figure of merit (after resolve)0.63Refinement statistics Resolution range (Å)50-2.550-2.8 No. of protein atoms2,6681,295 No. of water molecules8228 R/Rfree0.272/0.2990.253/0.264 r.m.s. deviation from idealityBond length (Å)0.0060.008Angle1.01°1.10° Open table in a new tab One Atg16CCD molecule is comprised of a single α-helix. About 10 N-terminal and 5 C-terminal residues did not show any defined electron density and were omitted from the model. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains six Atg16CCD molecules (A–F) (supplemental Fig. S1). The molecules A and B, C and D, and E and F interact as pairs, all in a similar manner. As a result, these three pairs of molecules form similar dimer structures with root mean square differences of 0.6∼0.9 Å for the Cα atoms. These three dimers further interact with each other in the crystal in various fashions (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, Atg16CCD was considered to form a homodimer as the basic unit in the crystal. The dimer structure of Atg16CCD is a highly twisted, parallel oriented, two-stranded coiled-coil that is 20–25 Å wide and 90 Å long with an approximate 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 2A). Although crystallization of full-length Atg16 was not possible, crystallization was possible when introducing mutations at exposed acidic residues (substitution of Asp101 and Glu102 with alanine), and the structure at 2.8 Å resolution was established (this construct will be referred to as Atg16F hereafter) (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains two Atg16F molecules (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Residues 55–142 of molecule A and residues 58–133 of molecule B show defined electron densities, whereas other regions, including the whole N-terminal domain, are disordered and omitted from the model. Each molecule is composed of a single α-helix, and they form a parallel coiled-coil dimer similar to the Atg16CCD structure but longer, as long as 110 Å (Fig. 2B). Residues 55–60 and 134–142 of molecule A (yellow in Fig. 2B) lack binding partners but have an α-helical structure, resulting in the 130 Å length. The other intermolecular interactions observed in the crystal, some of which seem to be achieved by point mutations, are completely different from those observed in the Atg16CCD crystal (supplemental Fig. S2). The dimer structures of Atg16CCD can be superimposed on that of the same region of Atg16F with root mean square differences of 1.6∼2.4 Å for Cα atoms. This somewhat large structural difference may be due to differences in the crystal packing and/or distinct lengths of the protein although point mutations could also affect the conformation of Atg16F. Whatever the case, it is certain that Atg16 has a parallel, dimeric coiled-coil structure, but the 2-fold symmetry axis observed in Atg16CCD is somewhat distorted in Atg16F. The dimer structure is stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions by a number of hydrophobic side chains faced at the dimer interface. In contrast, there are 14 acidic and 15 basic side chains that distribute evenly on the dimer surface (Fig. 2C). Coiled-coil motifs commonly share a seven-amino acid sequence, the 3–4-heptad repeat, with the positions denoted by the letters a to g (27Lupas A.N. Gruber M. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The first (a) and fourth (d) positions are predominantly occupied by hydrophobic residues. Previous studies have demonstrated a crucial role for the interior packing of the side chains at positions a and d to enable the establishment of the parallel coiled-coil conformation. For example, the presence of β-branched residues (Val, Ile, and Thr) in position a and non-β-branched residues in d promotes dimer formation, while the reverse arrangement favors tetramers (27Lupas A.N. Gruber M. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In the case of Atg16CCD, β-branched residues are abundant in position a but not in position d (Fig. 1B); therefore, the rule suggests the sequence of Atg16CCD as favorable for homodimer formation, consistent with the dimer structure in the crystal. Gel-filtration chromatography study has suggested that Atg16 forms a ∼350 kDa complex with Atg12-Atg5 conjugates due to Atg16 oligomerization, and therefore Atg16 was proposed to form a tetramer (9Kuma A. Mizushima N. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18619-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). As suggested by supplemental Fig. S3, it is likely that the recombinant Atg16CCD and full-length Atg16 behaved as a 4∼5-mer in gel-filtration chromatography, not affected by the concentration of NaCl. To verify the stoichiometry in solution, we employed analytical ultracentrifugation, which gives a molecular weight independent of the molecular shape. Sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation experiments indicated that a portion of both Atg16 and the Atg5·Atg16 complex tend to aggregate in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, whereas they were highly homogeneous in the presence of 500 mm NaCl (data not shown), suggesting that high concentrations of NaCl may stabilize Atg16 and the Atg5·Atg16 complex. Therefore, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in the presence of 500 mm NaCl. The sedimentation equilibrium data for Atg16 and the Atg5·Atg16 complex are shown in Fig. 3, in which the equilibrated concentration of proteins (absorbance at 280 nm) is plotted against the distance from the center of centrifuge. At equilibrium, sedimentation of proteins is balanced by diffusion opposing the concentration gradients. Because the average molecular mass of the proteins determines the balance, it can be calculated from the distribution pattern of proteins at equilibrium. The average molecular mass of Atg16 was estimated to be 31 kDa, which is 1.8 times the calculated molecular mass of the Atg16 monomer (17 kDa). The average molecular mass of the Atg5·Atg16 complex was estimated to be 108 kDa, which is twice the calculated molecular mass of the Atg5-Atg16 heterodimer (54 kDa). These results suggest that Atg16 exists as a dimer in solution, and the Atg5·Atg16 complex exists as a 2:2 heterotetramer, consistent with the dimer structure of Atg16 observed in the crystals. Besides the hydrophobic residues conserved at positions a and d, Atg16CCD conserves surface residues that are not responsible for the formation of the coiled-coil dimer (Fig. 1A). The conserved residues at positions other than a and d are mapped on the Atg16F structure (Fig. 4), clustering at the C-terminal half of the coiled-coil structure suggesting that they play important roles in the Atg16 activity. To investigate the significance of Atg16CCD and the conserved surface residues, we measured the in vivo activities of Atg16 mutants using three deletion mutants lacking either CCD (residues 60–118), the whole C-terminal region (60–150), or the extreme C-terminal region (residues 119–150) that is not required for the CCD but has 9 conserved surface residues. Additionally, four sets of alanine-substituted mutants, K94A/E97A (substitution of Lys94 and Glu97 with alanine), D101A/E102A, I104A/I108A/V112A, and N111A/Q114A, were prepared and expressed in Δatg16 cells using a CEN plasmid, pRS316. The autophagic activity was estimated by an ALP assay (25Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The ALP assay monitors the transport of ALP from the cytoplasm into the vacuole via autophagy by measuring the activity of the alkaline phosphatase that is artificially expressed in the cytosol as a proform and transported into the vacuole via autophagy, where it is processed into the mature form. As shown in Fig. 5A, Δatg16 cells expressing Atg16D101A/E102A, Atg16I104A/I108A/V112A, or Atg16Δ(119–150) showed significantly reduced autophagic activity, whereas those expressing Atg16K94A/E97A or Atg16N111A/Q114A showed autophagic activity comparable with that expressing wild-type Atg16. The Δatg16 cells expressing Atg16Δ(60–118) or Atg16Δ(60–150) showed no autophagic activity. Next, the activity of Atg16 mutants was assayed by monitoring the maturation of the proform of Ape1 (aminopeptidase I), which is transported into the vacuole via the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway under nutrition-rich conditions and by autophagy under starvation conditions, following this procedure, the protein is processed into a mature form within the vacuole. The Ape1 maturation in Δatg16 cells was restored in cells expressing wild-type Atg16, Atg16K94A/E97A, or Atg16N111A/Q114A in both growing and starvation conditions (Fig. 5B, left panels). In contrast, there was only a weak restoration of Ape1 maturation in cells expressing Atg16D101A/E102A, Atg16I104A/I108A/V112A, or Atg16Δ(119–150), and no restoration was observed for cells expressing ΔCCD mutants irrespective of the nutrient condition. The results were closely correlated with those of the ALP assay. We then monitored the Ape1 maturation in Δatg16 cells expressing a single mutant of Atg16 (D101A, E102A, I104A, I108A, or V112A) to clarify which residue is especially important for autophagy. All these residues other than Val112 are partially important for autophagic activity (Fig. 5B, right), suggesting that they collectively contribute to the function of Atg16 in autophagy. In above experiments, the expression of wild-type and mutant Atg16 proteins was not clearly detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown). We then expressed wild-type and mutant Atg16 proteins using a 2μ plasmid pRS426 as an expression vector. The expression level of all Atg16 mutants other than Atg16Δ(60–150) was comparable with that of wild-type Atg16 under both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions (Fig. 5C, upper panels). The Ape1 maturation was then monitored in these cells (Fig. 5C, lower panels), which showed close correlation with the results obtained using pRS316 plasmids (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the autophagic defects observed in Δatg16 cells expressing Atg16 mutants are not due to their low expression levels and that Atg16CCD and its conserved surface residues are crucial for autophagy. The previous analyses using gel-filtration chromatography showed that Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 forms a ∼350 kDa complex, suggesting that Atg16 may self-assemble into a tetramer and that it tethers four Atg12-Atg5 conjugates. However, the present structural analyses of both CCD and the full-length of Atg16 showed that Atg16 forms a parallel coiled-coil homodimer in the crystals, and furthermore, the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that Atg16 and the Atg5·Atg16 complex exist as a dimer and a 2:2 heterotetramer, respectively, in solution. The differences between the results of the gel-filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation studies may be due to the rod-like structure of Atg16 as gel-filtration chromatography often overestimates the molecular mass of nonglobular, extended proteins (28Lapouge K. Smith S.J. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10121-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of Atg16/Atg16L homologues suggests that the feature favored by coiled-coil dimers, i.e. β-branched residues (enclosed with a green square in Fig. 1A) are abundant at position a but not at position d, is conserved among most Atg16 homologues, indicating that the dimeric coiled-coil is a conserved feature among the Atg16 homologues. Therefore, mammalian Atg16L, which was reported to form a very large ∼800 kDa complex with mammalian Atg12-Atg5 conjugates by gel-filtration chromatography studies (11Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), also may have a dimeric coiled-coil structure. Mammalian Atg16L has a WD repeat domain and other insertions that are absent in yeast Atg16, and structural studies of Atg16L are required to establish the structural similarities and differences between Atg16 and Atg16L. Residues comprising the N-terminal domain of Atg16 are apparently disordered in the structure of Atg16F; here, the N-terminal domain is highly mobile, and its relative arrangement with CCD is not fixed in the crystal. According to the previously reported structure of the N-terminal domain of Atg16 (residues 1–57) complexed with Atg5, residues 22–41 and 43–46 of Atg16 form an α-helix and a short 310 helix, respectively, both responsible for the interaction with Atg5, but residues 47–57 of Atg16 do not have any secondary structures and are not required for the interaction with Atg5 (18Matsushita M. Suzuki N.N. Obara K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6763-6772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, we term residues 22–46 the “Atg5-binding domain” and residues 47–57 the “linker region” hereafter. The sequence alignment (Fig. 1A) shows that the Atg5-binding domain and CCD are widely conserved among Atg16 and Atg16L homologues, whereas the linker region connecting these domains varies among homologues. These structures, together with the previously reported structure of plant Atg12 (17Suzuki N.N. Yoshimoto K. Fujioka Y. Ohsumi Y. Inagaki F. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), make it possible to suggest a model of the whole Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex. Fig. 6 shows a model of the whole Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex, although, here, the relative arrangement of Atg12 and Atg5 and that of Atg5 and Atg16 have not been experimentally determined. The linker region of Atg16, the flexible C-terminal tail of Atg12 as well as the side chain of Atg5 K149, may allow the flexible arrangement of three moieties (Atg12, Atg5·Atg16(22–46), and Atg16CCD). Because Atg16CCD is a parallel coiled-coil dimer, two Atg5 molecules are positioned at the same edge of the long rod-like structure of Atg16CCD. Although each component has a well known fold (ubiquitin fold and coiled-coil), the overall architecture of the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex, containing six ubiquitin folds at one edge of the elongated coiled-coil dimer, is unique. In mammals, the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16L complex was reported to localize to the convex surface of isolation membranes and to detach immediately before or after the completion of autophagosome formation (11Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 29Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). This localization pattern is similar to that of coat proteins involved in various membrane trafficking events, which could lead to a hypothesis that the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex could also function as a coat-like protein specific to autophagosome formation. However, the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex possesses neither β-propeller nor α-solenoid motifs, both commonly observed in clathrin and coat protein complex II cages (30Stagg S.M. LaPointe P. Balch W.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the parallel dimeric architecture of the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex does not allow the formation of a concave surface or the symmetry observed in the Sec13-Sec31 heterotetramer of coat protein complex II and in the clathrin heavy chain trimer (triskelion) (30Stagg S.M. LaPointe P. Balch W.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex alone may not function as a structural cage that covers vesicles. Although it would still be possible that it functions together with other coat proteins to construct a coating protein complex, such interaction partners for Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 have not been reported. It should be noted that the evolutionary conserved surface residues cluster at the C-terminal half of Atg16CCD (Fig. 4). Because these residues are not involved in the formation of the dimeric coiled-coil structure of Atg16, they would play important roles in the functions of Atg16 as in vivo mutational analyses have shown that they are required for autophagy (Fig. 5). Since coiled-coil motifs in various proteins have been reported to mediate protein-protein interactions, Atg16CCD also seems to bind target proteins, where the conserved residues play crucial roles for the binding. Recently, the C-terminal region (residues 141–265) of the coiled-coil domain of human Atg16L, which has sequence similarity to the C-terminal half of Atg16CCD (Fig. 1A), was reported to directly and specifically interact with the GTP-bound form of Rab33B, a Golgi-resident small GTPase, although its significance in autophagy remains to be elucidated (31Itoh T.

In general, Rab-binding proteins possess two parallel or anti-parallel α-helices, which are directly involved in Rab binding (32Kawasaki M. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These proteins include GCC185, a trans-Golgi network golgin that binds Rab6 and Sec2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Sec4, a Rab GTPase. It is to be noted that their Rab-binding region has a parallel dimeric coiled-coil structure similar to Atg16 (33Burguete A.S. Fenn T.D. Brunger A.T. Pfeffer S.R.

Although Rab33 is not conserved in yeasts, these observations suggest that the conserved surface residues of Atg16 may be responsible for the interaction with Rab family protein(s). It is possible that Rab recruits the Atg12-Atg5·Atg16 complex through the interaction with Atg16 to autophagy-related membranes, whereby the complex exerts its critical functions in autophagosome formation. It would also be possible that unidentified factor(s) other than the Rab family proteins interact with the conserved surface residues of Atg16. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate might also interact with these conserved residues due to the presence of the flexible linker region of Atg16(47–57). Identification and characterization of binding target(s) for Atg16 are required for uncovering the function of Atg16 in autophagy.

https://openalex.org/W2093300338,"Background Recently, a large meta-analysis including over 28,000 participants identified nine different loci with association to serum uric acid (UA) levels. Since elevated serum UA levels potentially cause gout and are a possible risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), we performed two large case-control association analyses with participants from the German MI Family Study. In the first study, we assessed the association of the qualitative trait gout and ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers that showed association to UA serum levels. In the second study, the same genetic polymorphisms were analyzed for association with CAD. Methods and Findings A total of 683 patients suffering from gout and 1,563 healthy controls from the German MI Family Study were genotyped. Nine SNPs were identified from a recently performed genome-wide meta-analysis on serum UA levels (rs12129861, rs780094, rs734553, rs2231142, rs742132, rs1183201, rs12356193, rs17300741 and rs505802). Additionally, the marker rs6855911 was included which has been associated with gout in our cohort in a previous study. SNPs rs734553 and rs6855911, located in SLC2A9, and SNP rs2231142, known to be a missense polymorphism in ABCG2, were associated with gout (p = 5.6*10−7, p = 1.1*10−7, and p = 1.3*10−3, respectively). Other SNPs in the genes PDZK1, GCKR, LRRC16A, SLC17A1-SLC17A3, SLC16A9, SLC22A11 and SLC22A12 failed the significance level. None of the ten markers were associated with risk to CAD in our study sample of 1,473 CAD cases and 1,241 CAD-free controls. Conclusion SNP markers in SLC2A9 and ABCG2 genes were found to be strongly associated with the phenotype gout. However, not all SNP markers influencing serum UA levels were also directly associated with the clinical manifestation of gout in our study sample. In addition, none of these SNPs showed association with the risk to CAD in the German MI Family Study."

https://openalex.org/W2077099698,"Background Recently much attention has been given to developing national-scale micro-simulation models for livestock diseases that can be used to predict spread and assess the impact of control measures. The focus of these models has been on directly transmitted infections with little attention given to vector-borne diseases such as bluetongue, a viral disease of ruminants transmitted by Culicoides biting midges. Yet BT has emerged over the past decade as one of the most important diseases of livestock. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a stochastic, spatially-explicit, farm-level model to describe the spread of bluetongue virus (BTV) within and between farms. Transmission between farms was modeled by a generic kernel, which includes both animal and vector movements. Once a farm acquired infection, the within-farm dynamics were simulated based on the number of cattle and sheep kept on the farm and on local temperatures. Parameter estimates were derived from the published literature and using data from the outbreak of bluetongue in northern Europe in 2006. The model was validated using data on the spread of BTV in Great Britain during 2007. The sensitivity of model predictions to the shape of the transmission kernel was assessed. Conclusions/Significance The model is able to replicate the dynamics of BTV in Great Britain. Although uncertainty remains over the precise shape of the transmission kernel and certain aspects of the vector, the modeling approach we develop constitutes an ideal framework in which to incorporate these aspects as more and better data become available. Moreover, the model provides a tool with which to examine scenarios for the spread and control of BTV in Great Britain."

Here we use temporal adaptation to investigate the processing stage and generality of our sensorimotor timing estimates.Adaptation to artificially-induced delays between action and event can produce a startling percept--upon removal of the delay it feels as if the sensory event precedes its causative action. This temporal recalibration of action and event occurs in a quantitatively similar manner across the sensory modalities. Critically, it is robust to the replacement of one sense during the adaptation phase with another sense during the test judgment.Our findings suggest a high-level, supramodal recalibration mechanism. The effects are well described by a simple model which attempts to preserve the expected synchrony between action and event, but only when causality indicates it is reasonable to do so. We further demonstrate that this model successfully characterises related adaptation data from outside the sensorimotor domain."

We investigated the role of oscillatory shear stress (OSS) in modulating the proliferation of human osteoblast-like MG63 cells and its underlying mechanisms. Application of OSS (0.5 +/- 4 dynes/cm(2)) to MG63 cells induced sustained activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K (p70S6 kinase) signaling cascades and hence cell proliferation, which was accompanied by increased expression of cyclins A and D1, cyclin-dependent protein kinases-2, -4, and -6, and bone formation-related genes (c-fos, Egr-1, and Cox-2) and decreased expression of p21(CIP1) and p27(KIP1). OSS-induced activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and cell proliferation were inhibited by specific antibodies or small interference RNAs of alpha(v)beta(3) and beta(1) integrins and by dominant-negative mutants of Shc (Shc-SH2) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (FAK(F397Y)). Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that OSS induces sustained increases in association of Shc and FAK with alpha(v)beta(3) and beta(1) integrins and PI3K subunit p85, which were abolished by transfecting the cells with FAK(F397Y) or Shc-SH2. OSS also induced sustained activation of ERK, which was inhibited by the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and was required for OSS-induced activation of mTOR/p70S6K and proliferation in MG63 cells. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which OSS induces osteoblast-like cell proliferation through activation of alpha(v)beta(3) and beta(1) integrins and synergistic interactions of FAK and Shc with PI3K, leading to the modulation of downstream ERK and Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathways."

On the contrary, DHA exerts anticancer effects, and we have shown that DHA induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system. We now investigate the DHA metabolome in neuroblastoma using a targeted lipidomic approach in order to elucidate the mechanisms behind the DHA-induced cytotoxicity. LC-MS/MS analysis was used to identify DHA-derived lipid mediators in neuroblastoma cells. Presence of the 15-lipoxygenase enzyme was investigated using immunoblotting, and cytotoxic potency of DHA and DHA-derived compounds was compared using the MTT cell viability assay. Neuroblastoma cells metabolized DHA to 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA) via 17-hydroperoxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HpDHA) through 15-lipoxygenase and autoxidation. In contrast to normal neural cells, neuroblastoma cells did not produce the anti-inflammatory and protective lipid mediators, resolvins and protectins. 17-HpDHA had significant cytotoxic potency, with an IC(50) of 3-6 microM at 72 h, compared to 12-15 microM for DHA. alpha-Tocopherol protected cells from 17-HpDHA-induced cytotoxicity. DHA inhibited secretion of prostaglandin-E(2) and augmented the cytotoxic potency of the cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitor celecoxib. The cytotoxic effect of DHA in neuroblastoma is mediated through production of hydroperoxy fatty acids that accumulate to toxic intracellular levels with restricted production of its products, resolvins and protectins.-Gleissman, H., Yang, R., Martinod, K., Lindskog, M., Serhan, C.

https://openalex.org/W2003370420,"GATA5 is a member of the zinc finger transcription factor GATA family (GATA1-6) that plays a wide variety of roles in embryonic and adult development. Experiments in multiple model systems have emphasized the importance of the GATA family members 4-6 in the development of the endoderm and mesoderm. Yet despite overlapping expression patterns, there is little evidence of an important role for GATA5 in mammalian cardiac development. We have generated a new Gata5 mutant allele lacking exons 2 and 3 that encodes both zinc finger domains (Gata5(tm)(2)(Eem)), and we show that although Gata5(-/-) mice are viable, Gata4(+/-)5(-/-) mutants die at mid-gestation and exhibit profound cardiovascular defects, including abnormalities of cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac chamber maturation. These results demonstrate functional redundancy between Gata4 and Gata5 during cardiac development and implicate Gata5 as a candidate modifier gene for congenital heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2140861834,"Hepatic clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins depends on heparan sulfate and low density lipoprotein receptors expressed on the basal membrane of hepatocytes. Binding and uptake of the lipoproteins by way of heparan sulfate depends on the degree of sulfation of the chains based on accumulation of plasma triglycerides and delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in mice bearing a hepatocyte-specific alteration of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1) (MacArthur, J. M., Bishop, J. R., Stanford, K. I., Wang, L., Bensadoun, A., Witztum, J. L., and Esko, J. D. (2007) J. Clin. Invest. 117, 153-164). Inactivation of Ndst1 led to decreased overall sulfation of heparan sulfate due to coupling of uronyl 2-O-sulfation and glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfation to initial N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues. To determine whether lipoprotein clearance depends on 2-O-and 6-O-sulfation, we evaluated plasma triglyceride levels in mice containing loxP-flanked conditional alleles of uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (Hs2st(f/f)) and glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (Hs6st1(f/f)) and the bacterial Cre recombinase expressed in hepatocytes from the rat albumin (Alb) promoter. We show that Hs2st(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice accumulated plasma triglycerides and exhibited delayed clearance of intestinally derived chylomicrons and injected human very low density lipoproteins to the same extent as observed in Ndst1(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice. In contrast, Hs6st1(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice did not exhibit any changes in plasma triglycerides. Chemically modified heparins lacking N-sulfate and 2-O-sulfate groups did not block very low density lipoprotein binding and uptake in isolated hepatocytes, whereas heparin lacking 6-O-sulfate groups was as active as unaltered heparin. Our findings show that plasma lipoprotein clearance depends on specific subclasses of sulfate groups and not on overall charge of the chains."
https://openalex.org/W2162483267,"Members of the 70-kDa heat shock family can control and manipulate a host of oncogenic client proteins. This role of Hsp70 in both the folding and degradation of these client proteins makes it a potential drug target for certain forms of cancer. The phenothiazine family of compounds, as well as the flavonoid myricetin, was recently shown to inhibit Hsp70-ATPase activity, whereas members of the dihydropyrimidine family stimulated ATPase function. Akt, a major survival kinase, was found to be under the regulation of Hsp70, and when the ATPase activity of Hsp70 was increased or decreased by these compounds, Akt levels were also increased or decreased. Also, increasing Hsp70 levels concurrent with inhibition of its ATPase function synergistically reduced Akt levels to a greater extent than either manipulation alone, providing new insights about client fate decisions. Akt reductions mediated by Hsp70 inhibitors were prevented when Hsp70 expression was silenced with small interfering RNA. Inhibiting Hsp70 ATPase function produced cytotoxic events only in breast cancer cell lines where Akt dysfunction was previously shown, suggesting therapeutic specificity depending on the Hsp70 client profile. Thus, increasing Hsp70 levels combined with inhibiting its ATPase function may serve to dramatically reduce Akt levels and facilitate cell death in certain types of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2105544327,"All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) supports embryonic development, central nervous system function, and the immune response. atRA initiates neurogenesis and dendritic growth in the hippocampus and is required for spatial memory; superphysiological atRA inhibits neurogenesis, causes teratology and/or embryo toxicity, and alters cognitive function and behavior. Because abnormal atRA shares pathological conditions with alcoholism, inhibition of retinol (vitamin A) activation into atRA has been credited widely as a mechanism of ethanol toxicity. Here, we analyze the effects of ethanol on retinoid concentrations in vivo during normal vitamin A nutriture, using sensitive and analytically robust assays. Ethanol either increased or had no effect on atRA, regardless of changes in retinol and retinyl esters. Acute ethanol (3.5 g/kg) increased atRA in adult hippocampus (1.6-fold), liver (2.4-fold), and testis (1.5-fold). Feeding dams a liquid diet with 6.5% ethanol from embryonic day 13 (e13) to e19 increased atRA in fetal hippocampus (up to 20-fold) and cortex (up to 50-fold), depending on blood alcohol content. One-month feeding of the 6.5% ethanol diet increased atRA in adult hippocampus (20-fold), cortex (2-fold), testis (2-fold), and serum (10-fold). Tissue-specific increases in retinoid dehydrogenase mRNAs and activities, extrahepatic retinol concentrations, and atRA catabolism combined to produce site-specific effects. Because a sustained increase in atRA has deleterious effects on the central nervous system and embryo development, these data suggest that superphysiological atRA contributes to ethanol pathological conditions, including cognitive dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome.—Kane, M.

https://openalex.org/W2081500546,"The differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and dendritic cells is accompanied by induction of cell-surface neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) and cathepsin A (CathA), the latter forming a complex with and activating Neu1. To clarify the biological importance of this phenomenon we have developed the gene-targeted mouse models of a CathA deficiency (CathA(S190A)) and a double CathA/Neu1 deficiency (CathA(S190A-Neo)). Macrophages of CathA(S190A-Neo) mice and their immature dendritic cells showed a significantly reduced capacity to engulf Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and positively and negatively charged polymer beads as well as IgG-opsonized beads and erythrocytes. Properties of the cells derived from CathA(S190A) mice were indistinguishable from those of wild-type controls, suggesting that the absence of Neu1, which results in the increased sialylation of the cell surface proteins, probably affects multiple receptors for phagocytosis. Indeed, treatment of the cells with purified mouse Neu1 reduced surface sialylation and restored phagocytosis. Because Neu1-deficient cells showed reduced internalization of IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes whereas binding of the erythrocytes to the cells at 4 degrees C persisted, we speculate that the absence of Neu1 in particular affected transduction of signals from the Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G (FcgammaR). Indeed the macrophages from the Neu1-deficient mice showed increased sialylation and impaired phosphorylation of FcgammaR as well as markedly reduced phosphorylation of Syk kinase in response to treatment with IgG-opsonized beads. Altogether our data suggest that the cell surface Neu1 activates the phagocytosis in macrophages and dendritic cells through desialylation of surface receptors, thus, contributing to their functional integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2078464821,"The functional significance of neuronal death for pathogenesis of epilepsy and the underlying molecular mechanisms thereof remain incompletely understood. The p53 transcription factor has been implicated in seizure damage, but its target genes and the influence of cell death under its control on epilepsy development are unknown. In the present study, we report that status epilepticus (SE) triggered by intra-amygdala kainic acid in mice causes rapid p53 accumulation and subsequent hippocampal damage. Expression of p53-up-regulated mediator of apoptosis (Puma), a proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein under p53 control, was increased within a few hours of SE. Induction of Puma was blocked by pharmacologic inhibition of p53, and hippocampal damage was also reduced. Puma induction was also blocked in p53-deficient mice subject to SE. Compared to Puma-expressing mice, Puma-deficient mice had significantly smaller hippocampal lesions after SE. Long-term, continuous telemetric EEG monitoring revealed a approximately 60% reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures in the Puma-deficient mice compared to Puma-expressing mice. These are the first data showing genetic deletion of a proapoptotic protein acting acutely to influence neuronal death subsequently alters the phenotype of epilepsy in the long-term, supporting the concept that apoptotic pathway activation is a trigger of epileptogenesis.-Engel, T., Murphy, B.

Coating synthetic grafts with patients' own endothelial cells has been suggested to improve the patency rate and overall success of bypass surgeries. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from leftover pieces of human saphenous vein/mammary artery. We demonstrate that EPCs can be expanded to generate millions of cells under low-density culture conditions. Exposure to high-density conditions induces differentiation to endothelial cell phenotype. EPC–derived endothelial cells show expression of CD144high, CD31, and vWF. We then assessed the ability of differentiated endothelial cells to adhere and grow on small diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) tubings. Since ePTFE tubings are highly hydrophobic, we optimized protocols to introduce hydrophilic groups on luminal surface of ePTFE tubings. We demonstrate here a stepwise protocol that involves introduction of hydrophilic moieties and coating with defined ECM components that support adhesion of endothelial cells, but not of blood platelets. Conclusion/Significance Our data confirms that endothelial progenitors obtained from adult human blood vessels can be expanded in vitro under xenoprotein-free conditions, for potential use in endothelialization of small diameter ePTFE grafts. These endothelialized grafts may represent a promising treatment strategy for improving the clinical outcome of small-caliber vascular grafts in cardiac bypass surgeries."
https://openalex.org/W2043287196,"Background Dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity is widely considered as a cell-mediated rather than antibody-mediated immune response. At present, very little is known about the role of antigen-specific antibodies and B cells in the development of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and this is the subject of the present investigation. Methodology/Principal Findings Data obtained from multiple lines of experiments unequivocally showed that the formation of dinitrochlorobenzene-specific Abs played an important role in the development of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity. The appearance of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced skin dermatitis matched in timing the appearance of the circulating dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies. Adoptive transfer of sera containing dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies from dinitrochlorobenzene-treated mice elicited a much stronger hypersensitivity reaction than the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from the same donors. Moreover, dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity was strongly suppressed in B cell-deficient mice with no DNCB-specific antibodies. It was also observed that treatment of animals with dinitrochlorobenzene polarized Th cells into Th2 differentiation by increasing the production of Th2 cytokines while decreasing the production of Th1 cytokines. Conclusions/Significance In striking contrast to the long-held belief that dinitrochlorobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response, the results of our present study demonstrated that the production of dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies by activated B cells played an indispensible role in the pathogenesis of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced CHS. These findings may provide new possibilities in the treatment of human contact hypersensitivity conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2049115584,"Background When sound arrives at the eardrum it has already been filtered by the body, head, and outer ear. This process is mathematically described by the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), which are characteristic for the spatial position of a sound source and for the individual ear. HRTFs in the barn owl (Tyto alba) are also shaped by the facial ruff, a specialization that alters interaural time differences (ITD), interaural intensity differences (ILD), and the frequency spectrum of the incoming sound to improve sound localization. Here we created novel stimuli to simulate the removal of the barn owl's ruff in a virtual acoustic environment, thus creating a situation similar to passive listening in other animals, and used these stimuli in behavioral tests. Methodology/Principal Findings HRTFs were recorded from an owl before and after removal of the ruff feathers. Normal and ruff-removed conditions were created by filtering broadband noise with the HRTFs. Under normal virtual conditions, no differences in azimuthal head-turning behavior between individualized and non-individualized HRTFs were observed. The owls were able to respond differently to stimuli from the back than to stimuli from the front having the same ITD. By contrast, such a discrimination was not possible after the virtual removal of the ruff. Elevational head-turn angles were (slightly) smaller with non-individualized than with individualized HRTFs. The removal of the ruff resulted in a large decrease in elevational head-turning amplitudes. Conclusions/Significance The facial ruff a) improves azimuthal sound localization by increasing the ITD range and b) improves elevational sound localization in the frontal field by introducing a shift of iso–ILD lines out of the midsagittal plane, which causes ILDs to increase with increasing stimulus elevation. The changes at the behavioral level could be related to the changes in the binaural physical parameters that occurred after the virtual removal of the ruff. These data provide new insights into the function of external hearing structures and open up the possibility to apply the results on autonomous agents, creation of virtual auditory environments for humans, or in hearing aids."
https://openalex.org/W2063294207,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of transcriptional induction of the small GTPase RhoB gene by the transforming growth factor β (TGFß) signaling pathway and the role of this regulation in TGFß-induced cell migration. To achieve our goals, we utilized a combination of siRNAmediated gene silencing, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer receptor and MAPK inhibition, transactivation assays, and DNA-protein interaction assays in human HaCaT keratinocytes. We found that the RhoB gene is a direct transcriptional target of TGFß. We show that TGFß activates an early MEK/ERK pathway and that this activation is required for the recruitment of Smad3 to a novel, nonclassical, Smad binding element in the proximal RhoB promoter, in a p53-dependent manner. This element is overlapping with a CCAAT box that constitutively binds nuclear factor Y. Mutagenesis of this site abolished the Smad-mediated transactivation of the RhoB promoter. Finally, silencing of RhoB gene expression via siRNA or utilization of a dominant negative form of RhoB significantly inhibited TGFß-induced migration of HaCaT keratinocytes and DU145 prostate cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2090352999,"Immunization with irradiated Plasmodium sporozoites induces sterile immunity in rodents, monkeys and humans. The major surface component of the sporozoite the circumsporozoite protein (CS) long considered as the antigen predominantly responsible for this immunity, thus remains the leading candidate antigen for vaccines targeting the parasite's pre-erythrocytic (PE) stages. However, this role for CS was questioned when we recently showed that immunization with irradiated sporozoites (IrrSpz) of a P. berghei line whose endogenous CS was replaced by that of P. falciparum still conferred sterile protection against challenge with wild type P. berghei sporozoites. In order to investigate the involvement of CS in the cross-species protection recently observed between the two rodent parasites P. berghei and P. yoelii, we adopted our gene replacement approach for the P. yoelii CS and exploited the ability to conduct reciprocal challenges. Overall, we found that immunization led to sterile immunity irrespective of the origin of the CS in the immunizing or challenge sporozoites. However, for some combinations, immune responses to CS contributed to the acquisition of protective immunity and were dependent on the immunizing IrrSpz dose. Nonetheless, when data from all the cross-species immunization/challenges were considered, the immune responses directed against non-CS parasite antigens shared by the two parasite species played a major role in the sterile protection induced by immunization with IrrSpz. This opens the perspective to develop a single vaccine formulation that could protect against multiple parasite species."
https://openalex.org/W2048254061,"We performed x-ray crystallographic analyses of the 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer (Acd) hydrolase (NylA) from Arthrobacter sp., an enzyme responsible for the degradation of the nylon-6 industry byproduct. The fold adopted by the 472-amino acid polypeptide generated a compact mixed alpha/beta fold, typically found in the amidase signature superfamily; this fold was especially similar to the fold of glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit A (z score, 49.4) and malonamidase E2 (z score, 44.8). Irrespective of the high degree of structural similarity to the typical amidase signature superfamily enzymes, the specific activity of NylA for glutamine, malonamide, and indoleacetamide was found to be lower than 0.5% of that for Acd. However, NylA possessed carboxylesterase activity nearly equivalent to the Acd hydrolytic activity. Structural analysis of the inactive complex between the activity-deficient S174A mutant of NylA and Acd, performed at 1.8 A resolution, suggested the following enzyme/substrate interactions: a Ser(174)-cis-Ser(150)-Lys(72) triad constitutes the catalytic center; the backbone N in Ala(171) and Ala(172) are involved in oxyanion stabilization; Cys(316)-S(gamma) forms a hydrogen bond with nitrogen (Acd-N(7)) at the uncleaved amide bond in two equivalent amide bonds of Acd. A single S174A, S150A, or K72A substitution in NylA by site-directed mutagenesis decreased the Acd hydrolytic and esterolytic activities to undetectable levels, indicating that Ser(174)-cis-Ser(150)-Lys(72) is essential for catalysis. In contrast, substitutions at position 316 specifically affected Acd hydrolytic activity, suggesting that Cys(316) is responsible for Acd binding. On the basis of the structure and functional analysis, we discussed the catalytic mechanisms and evolution of NylA in comparison with other Ser-reactive hydrolases."

Ate1 plays a role in the regulation of cytoskeleton and is essential for cardiovascular development and angiogenesis—capillary remodeling driven by in-tissue migration of endothelial cells. To address the role of Ate1 in cytoskeleton-dependent processes and endothelial cell function during development, we produced a conditional mouse knockout with Ate1 deletion driven by Tek endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase promoter expressed in the endothelium and in the germ line. Contrary to expectations, Tek-Ate1 mice were viable and had no visible angiogenesis-related phenotypes; however, these mice showed reproductive defects, with high rates of embryonic lethality in the second generation, at stages much earlier than the complete Ate1 knockout strain. While some of the early lethality originated from the subpopulation of embryos with homozygous Tek-Cre transgene—a problem that has not previously been reported for this commercial mouse strain—a distinct subpopulation of embryos had lethality at early post-implantation stages that could be explained only by a previously unknown defect in gametogenesis originating from Tek-driven Ate1 deletion in premeiotic germs cells. These results demonstrate a novel role of Ate1 in germ cell development."
https://openalex.org/W2107931984,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disease originating from myeloid progenitor cells with a heterogeneous genetic background. High-dose cytarabine is used as the standard consolidation chemotherapy. Oncogenic RAS mutations are frequently observed in AML, and are associated with beneficial response to cytarabine. Why AML-patients with oncogenic RAS benefit most from high-dose cytarabine post-remission therapy is not well understood. Here we used bone marrow cells expressing a conditional MLL-ENL-ER oncogene to investigate the interaction of oncogenic RAS and chemotherapeutic agents. We show that oncogenic RAS synergizes with cytotoxic agents such as cytarabine in activation of DNA damage checkpoints, resulting in a p53-dependent genetic program that reduces clonogenicity and increases myeloid differentiation. Our data can explain the beneficial effects observed for AML patients with oncogenic RAS treated with higher dosages of cytarabine and suggest that induction of p53-dependent differentiation, e.g. by interfering with Mdm2-mediated degradation, may be a rational approach to increase cure rate in response to chemotherapy. The data also support the notion that the therapeutic success of cytotoxic drugs may depend on their ability to promote the differentiation of tumor-initiating cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065581751,"Aiming to answer the broad question ""When does mutation occur?"" this study examined the time of appearance, dominance, and completeness of in vivo Gag mutations in primary HIV-1 subtype C infection.A primary HIV-1C infection cohort comprised of 8 acutely and 34 recently infected subjects were followed frequently up to 500 days post-seroconversion (p/s). Gag mutations were analyzed by employing single-genome amplification and direct sequencing. Gag mutations were determined in relation to the estimated time of seroconversion. Time of appearance, dominance, and completeness was compared for different types of in vivo Gag mutations.Reverse mutations to the wild type appeared at a median (IQR) of 62 (44;139) days p/s, while escape mutations from the wild type appeared at 234 (169;326) days p/s (p<0.001). Within the subset of mutations that became dominant, reverse and escape mutations appeared at 54 (30;78) days p/s and 104 (47;198) days p/s, respectively (p<0.001). Among the mutations that reached completeness, reverse and escape mutations appeared at 54 (30;78) days p/s and 90 (44;196) days p/s, respectively (p=0.006). Time of dominance for reverse mutations to and escape mutations from the wild type was 58 (44;105) days p/s and 219 (90;326) days p/s, respectively (p<0.001). Time of completeness for reverse and escape mutations was 152 (100;176) days p/s and 243 (101;370) days p/s, respectively (p=0.001). Fitting a Cox proportional hazards model with frailties confirmed a significantly earlier time of appearance (hazard ratio (HR): 2.6; 95% CI: 2.3-3.0), dominance (4.8 (3.4-6.8)), and completeness (3.6 (2.3-5.5)) of reverse mutations to the wild type Gag than escape mutations from the wild type. Some complex mutational pathways in Gag included sequential series of reversions and escapes.The study identified the timing of different types of in vivo Gag mutations in primary HIV-1 subtype C infection in relation to the estimated time of seroconversion. Overall, the in vivo reverse mutations to the wild type occurred significantly earlier than escape mutations from the wild type. This shorter time to incidence of reverse mutations remained in the subsets of in vivo Gag mutations that reached dominance or completeness."
https://openalex.org/W1992047620,"Background It is unclear whether the loss of physiological complexity during the aging process is due to genetic variations. The APOE gene has been studied extensively in regard to its relationship with aging-associated medical illness. We hypothesize that diminished physiological complexity, as measured by heart rate variability, is influenced by polymorphisms in the APOE allele among elderly individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 102 robust, non-demented, elderly subjects with normal functions of daily activities participated in this study (97 males and 5 females, aged 79.2±4.4 years, range 72–92 years). Among these individuals, the following two APOE genotypes were represented: ε4 non-carriers (n = 87, 85.3%) and ε4 carriers (n = 15, 14.7%). Multi-scale entropy (MSE), an analysis used in quantifying complexity for nonlinear time series, was employed to analyze heart-rate dynamics. Reduced physiological complexity, as measured by MSE, was significantly associated with the presence of the APOE ε4 allele in healthy elderly subjects, as compared to APOE ε4 allele non-carriers (24.6±5.5 versus 28.9±5.2, F = 9.429, p = 0.003, respectively). Conclusions/Significance This finding suggests a role for the APOE gene in the diminished physiological complexity seen in elderly populations."
https://openalex.org/W2060199017,"Background RalA and RalB are multifuntional GTPases involved in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, oncogenic transformation and membrane trafficking. Here we investigated the mechanisms leading to activation of Ral proteins in pancreatic β-cells and analyzed the impact on different steps of the insulin-secretory process. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that RalA is the predominant isoform expressed in pancreatic islets and insulin-secreting cell lines. Silencing of this GTPase in INS-1E cells by RNA interference led to a decrease in secretagogue-induced insulin release. Real-time measurements by fluorescence resonance energy transfer revealed that RalA activation in response to secretagogues occurs within 3–5 min and reaches a plateau after 10–15 min. The activation of the GTPase is triggered by increases in intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP and is prevented by the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker Nifedipine and by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89. Defective insulin release in cells lacking RalA is associated with a decrease in the secretory granules docked at the plasma membrane detected by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy and with a strong impairment in Phospholipase D1 activation in response to secretagogues. RalA was found to be activated by RalGDS and to be severely hampered upon silencing of this GDP/GTP exchange factor. Accordingly, INS-1E cells lacking RalGDS displayed a reduction in hormone secretion induced by secretagogues and in the number of insulin-containing granules docked at the plasma membrane. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our data indicate that RalA activation elicited by the exchange factor RalGDS in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP controls hormone release from pancreatic β-cell by coordinating the execution of different events in the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2066386952,"The non-heme iron(II) dioxygenase family of enzymes contain a common 2-His-1-carboxylate iron-binding motif. These enzymes catalyze a wide variety of oxidative reactions, such as the hydroxylation of aliphatic C-H bonds. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) is an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent iron(II) dioxygenase that catalyzes the post-translational hydroxylation of proline residues in protocollagen strands, stabilizing the ensuing triple helix. Human P4H residues His412, Asp414, and His483 have been identified as an iron-coordinating 2-His-1-carboxylate motif. Enzymes that catalyze oxidative halogenation do so by a mechanism similar to that of P4H. These halogenases retain the active-site histidine residues, but the carboxylate ligand is replaced with a halide ion. We replaced Asp414 of P4H with alanine (to mimic the active site of a halogenase) and with glycine. These substitutions do not, however, convert P4H into a halogenase. Moreover, the hydroxylase activity of D414A P4H cannot be rescued with small molecules. In addition, rearranging the two His and one Asp residues in the active site eliminates hydroxylase activity. Our results demonstrate a high stringency for the iron-binding residues in the P4H active site. We conclude that P4H, which catalyzes an especially demanding chemical transformation, is recalcitrant to change."
https://openalex.org/W2133332425,"Central to the discovery of neuroactive compounds produced by predatory marine snails of the superfamily Conoidea (cone snails, terebrids, and turrids) is identifying those species with a venom apparatus. Previous analyses of western Pacific terebrid specimens has shown that some Terebridae groups have secondarily lost their venom apparatus. In order to efficiently characterize terebrid toxins, it is essential to devise a key for identifying which species have a venom apparatus. The findings presented here integrate molecular phylogeny and the evolution of character traits to infer the presence or absence of the venom apparatus in the Terebridae. Using a combined dataset of 156 western and 33 eastern Pacific terebrid samples, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on analyses of 16S, COI and 12S mitochondrial genes. The 33 eastern Pacific specimens analyzed represent four different species: Acus strigatus, Terebra argyosia, T. ornata, and T. cf. formosa. Anatomical analysis was congruent with molecular characters, confirming that species included in the clade Acus do not have a venom apparatus, while those in the clade Terebra do. Discovery of the association between terebrid molecular phylogeny and the occurrence of a venom apparatus provides a useful tool for effectively identifying the terebrid lineages that may be investigated for novel pharmacological active neurotoxins, enhancing conservation of this important resource, while providing supplementary information towards understanding terebrid evolutionary diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2158901770,"Bleomycin (Bm) N-acetyltransferase, BAT, is a self-resistance determinant in Bm-producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003. In our present study, we crystallized BAT under both a terrestrial and a microgravity environment in the International Space Station. In addition to substrate-free BAT, the crystal structures of BAT in a binary complex with CoA and in a ternary complex with Bm and CoA were determined. BAT forms a dimer structure via interaction of its C-terminal domains in the monomers. However, each N-terminal domain in the dimer is positioned without mutual interaction. The tunnel observed in the N-terminal domain of BAT has two entrances: one that adopts a wide funnel-like structure necessary to accommodate the metal-binding domain of Bm, and another narrow entrance that accommodates acetyl-CoA (AcCoA). A groove formed on the dimer interface of two BAT C-terminal domains accommodates the DNA-binding domain of Bm. In a ternary complex of BAT, BmA(2), and CoA, a thiol group of CoA is positioned near the primary amine of Bm at the midpoint of the tunnel. This proximity ensures efficient transfer of an acetyl group from AcCoA to the primary amine of Bm. Based on the BAT crystal structure and the enzymatic kinetic study, we propose that the catalytic mode of BAT takes an ordered-like mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2057630012,"The actin-binding protein caldesmon (CaD) reversibly inhibits smooth muscle contraction. In non-muscle cells, a shorter CaD isoform co-exists with microfilaments in the stress fibers at the quiescent state, but the phosphorylated CaD is found at the leading edge of migrating cells where dynamic actin filament remodeling occurs. We have studied the effect of a C-terminal fragment of CaD (H32K) on the kinetics of the in vitro actin polymerization by monitoring the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. Addition of H32K or its phosphorylated form either attenuated or accelerated the pyrene emission enhancement, depending on whether it was added at the early or the late phase of actin polymerization. However, the CaD fragment had no effect on the yield of sedimentable actin, nor did it affect the actin ATPase activity. Our findings can be explained by a model in which nascent actin filaments undergo a maturation process that involves at least two intermediate conformational states. If present at early stages of actin polymerization, CaD stabilizes one of the intermediate states and blocks the subsequent filament maturation. Addition of CaD at a later phase accelerates F-actin formation. The fact that CaD is capable of inhibiting actin filament maturation provides a novel function for CaD and suggests an active role in the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2022624390,"HCN channels are thought to be structurally similar to Kv channels, but show much lower selectivity for K+. The approximately 3.3 A selectivity filter of K+ channels is formed by the pore-lining sequence XT(V/I)GYG, with X usually T, and is held stable by key residues in the P-loop. Differences in the P-loop sequence of HCN channels (eg. the pore-lining sequence L478C479IGYG) suggest these residues could account for differences in selectivity between these channel families. Despite being expressed, L478T/C479T HCN4 channels did not produce current. Since threonine in the second position is highly conserved in K+ channels, we also studied C479T channels. Based on permeability ratios (PX/PK), C479T HCN4 channels (K+(1)>Rb+(0.85)>Cs+(0.59)>Li+(0.50)>or=Na+(0.49)) were less selective than WT rabbit HCN4 (K+(1)>Rb+(0.48)>Cs+(0.31)>or=Na+(0.29)>Li+(0.03)), indicating that the TIGYG sequence is insufficient to confer K+ selectivity to HCN channels. C479T HCN4 channels had an increased permeability to large organic cations than WT HCN4 channels, as well as increased unitary K+ conductance, and altered channel gating. Collectively, these results suggest that HCN4 channels have larger pores than K+ channels and replacement of the cysteine at position 479 with threonine further increases pore size. Furthermore, selected mutations in other regions linked previously to pore stability in K+ channels (ie. S475D, S475E and F471W/K472W) were also unable to confer K+ selectivity to C479T HCN4 channels. Our findings establish the presence of the TIGYG pore-lining sequence does not confer K+ selectivity to rabbit HCN4 channels, and suggests that differences in selectivity of HCN4 versus K+ channels originate from differences outside the P-loop region."

https://openalex.org/W2064517344,"In 1994 there was a horrific genocide in Rwanda following years of tension, resulting in the murder of at least 800,000 people. Although many people were injured in addition to those killed, no attempt has been made to assess the lasting burden of physical injuries related to these events. The aim of this study was to estimate the current burden of musculoskeletal impairment (MSI) attributable to the 1994 war and related violence.A national cross-sectional survey of MSI was conducted in Rwanda. 105 clusters of 80 people were selected through probability proportionate to size sampling. Households within clusters were selected through compact segment sampling. Enumerated people answered a seven-question screening test to assess whether they might have an MSI. Those who were classed as potential cases in the screening test were examined and interviewed by a physiotherapist, using a standard protocol that recorded the site, nature, cause, and severity of the MSI. People with MSI due to trauma were asked whether this trauma occurred during the 1990-1994 war or during the episodes that preceded or followed this war. Out of 8,368 people enumerated, 6,757 were available for screening and examination (80.8%). 352 people were diagnosed with an MSI (prevalence=5.2%, 95% CI=4.5-5.9%). 106 cases of MSI (30.6%) were classified as resulting from trauma, based on self-report and the physiotherapist's assessment. Of these, 14 people (13.2%) reported that their trauma-related MSI occurred during the 1990-1994 war, and a further 7 (6.6%) that their trauma-related MSI occurred during the violent episodes that preceded and followed the war, giving an overall prevalence of trauma-related MSI related to the 1990-1994 war of 0.3% (95% CI=0.2-0.4%).A decade on, the overall prevalence of MSI was relatively high in Rwanda but few cases appeared to be the result of the 1994 war or related violence."
