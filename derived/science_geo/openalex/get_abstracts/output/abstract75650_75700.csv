https://openalex.org/W1526028994,"Abstract A correlation between the kinetics of the pyruvate kinase reaction and the enhancements of the relaxation rate of the nuclear spins of water protons in the ternary enzyme-manganese-substrate (E-Mn-S) complexes, et, has revealed certain salient features of the pathway of the reaction and the structure of the ternary intermediates. The rate equation for initial velocities of the forward reaction was derived by assuming (a) rapid simultaneous equilibria of enzyme with divalent metal ion, adenosine diphosphate, manganese adenosine diphosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, (b) random order of combination, and (c) phosphoryl transfer as the rate-determining step. This formulation permitted the calculation of the dissociation constants Ks of the ES complexes and K3 of the EMS complexes for ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate. The values of K3 for E-Mn-ADP and E-Mn-phosphoenolpyruvate were determined directly by equilibrium experiments with proton relaxation rate (PRR) with the use of et as the parameter which characterized the ternary complexes. The values of Ks for E-phosphoenolpyruvate and E-ADP were determined directly by equilibrium experiments with the use of the kinetic protection method with p-chloromercuribenzoate inactivation. The agreement of the dissociation constants of the binary and ternary enzyme complexes determined by equilibrium methods with the kinetically calculated ones, taken in conjunction with the previously established agreement of the dissociation constant of EM with its kinetically calculated activator constant, validates the assumed random binding of metal, ADP, MnADP, and phosphoenolpyruvate to the enzyme. The inhibitor constant, Ki, for ATP agreed well with its K3 determined by PRR. In the ternary pyruvate complex, the results from PRR data differed from the kinetic data in two ways: pyruvate was not competitive with phosphoenol pyruvate, and K3 from PRR data was an order of magnitude lower than Ki obtained kinetically. The value of K3 was raised to the Ki value when the PRR titration was performed in the presence of ADP or inorganic phosphate, suggesting that the breakdown of the product complex in the pyruvate kinase reaction proceeds by a preferred order in which pyruvate dissociates first. The PRR enhancement values of all the ternary EMS complexes, et, were found to be less than eb, the enhancement of the binary complex; this decrease may be ascribed in part to the replacement of water ligands by groups on the substrate. The magnitude of the decrease of et(ATP) with respect to et(ADP) is consistent with a metal bridge structure in which the divalent cation is coordinated both to the enzyme and to the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP in the active complex. No data have been found which contravene a metal bridge structure. Kinetic data which favor this structure may be adduced from the relative binding constants of substrates to the manganese- and magnesium-activated enzyme; changing the divalent activator from manganese to magnesium, which has a lower affinity for ligands, raised the K3 of phosphoenolpyruvate and the Ki of ATP and of pyruvate by factors of 2.6, 5.1, and 2.6, respectively, but it had little effect on the K3 of ADP. The structure of the E-Mn-phosphoenolpyruvate complex as reflected in the finding that et(phosphoenolpyruvate) << eb requires a change in the environment of the manganese other than mere replacement of water ligands; such a change may be ascribed to a conformational change in the protein at the binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1501808206,"A pigeon pancreas microsomal system supplemented with microsomal supernatant fluid or pH 5 enzyme incorporates radioactive amino acids into purified amylase. Several parameters of the incorporation system are presented. Tryptic digestion of the isolated radioactive amylase shows that the amino acids are incorporated into peptide linkage within the protein, as in amylase synthesized in vivo. The radioactive amylase is first found on the attached ribosomes and with time is transferred to the deoxycholate-soluble microsomal subfraction, which corresponds largely to the content of microsomal vesicles. Only about 30% of the released amylase is found as soluble protein in the incubation medium. The system in vitro thus comprises the vectorial mechanism involved in the transfer of newly synthesized secretory protein across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into the cisternal space."

The enzyme, originally present in subcellular particulate fractions, could be released in a soluble form by treatment with appropriate detergents and was partially purified by conventional procedures. The most highly purified enzyme preparations catalyzed the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, whereas lecithin and phosphatidylethanolamine were unaffected. The products of the reaction were identified as phosphorylcholine and ceramide. Lecithin was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1488937720,"Abstract Human bone marrow was pulse-labeled with radioactive amino acids for various times. Hemoglobin A after 3 min of pulse showed a sudden increase in the relative specific activities of peptides between position 90 and the COOH terminus in both the α and β chains. A control point in this region is postulated beyond which the growth of the polypeptide chains is markedly reduced, perhaps because of the assumption of a specific tertiary conformation of the growing chains after heme insertion. Pulse labeling of hemoglobin A2 indicates that δ chains are assembled at a rate much less than that for either α and β chains of hemoglobin A or α chains of hemoglobin A2. This can, in part, account for the small quantity of hemoglobin A2 with respect to hemoglobin A found in normal peripheral blood. Also, as cells age, their capacity to produce hemoglobin A2 is lost at a greater rate than their capacity to produce hemoglobin A. The assembly of α chains for both hemoglobins A and A2 proceeds at about the same rate, suggesting a common pool of α chains for the two hemoglobin types and their synthesis in the same cell."

The complex has been isolated by chromatography on agarose gel and characterized by sedimentation rate near 24 S(w.20) at both pH 5.3 and 7.4, by coagulability when treated with thrombin, and by content of fibrinopeptides. Formation of the complex could provide a pathway for solubilization of monomeric fibrin produced in circulating blood."

https://openalex.org/W1491370530,"Abstract Fractionation of goat colostrum gave a 100- to 200-fold purified enzyme that catalyzed the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine to certain glycoprotein acceptors. The latter were prepared from α1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) and fetuin by treatment with purified sialidase, β-galactosidase, and hexosaminidase. Ribonuclease B and ovalbumin were active as N-acetylglucosamine acceptors without pretreatment with glycosidases. Based on the structures of the glycoprotein acceptors, it is tentatively concluded that the N-acetylglucosamine residue is transferred to terminal mannose units in the glycoproteins. This reaction is suggested to be an important step in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2076802187,These units responded vigorously to stimuli moving entirely across their receptive field centers in one direction (preferred) and not at all when the direction of motion was reversed (null). The directional selectivity was the result of an inhibitory mechanism which prevented responses to null movements. Surrounding each field center was a concentric antagonistic region produced by a second inhibitory mechanism.
https://openalex.org/W1528545703,"Abstract 1. The association and ionization constants for nickel (II) and a selection of l-histidine-containing peptides have been computed together with the constants for copper (II) and acetylglycylglycyl-l-histidylglycine. 2. A close parallel between the titration behavior of copper (II) apomyoglobin complexes and model peptides has been obtained on the assumption that 1 of the 4 bound metal ions is situated at the NH2-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain. 3. Visible absorption spectra of nickel (II) and copper (II) apomyoglobin complexes containing 4 metal ions per mole have been measured and found to be consistent with the binding of 1 metal ion at the NH2-terminal locus and 3-metal ions in the interior of the peptide chain at histidine loci. 4. Optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra in the visible region have been measured for both the protein and the peptide complexes. Strict similarities were not, in general, found and the various explanations for this failure are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1488137266,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of the cytochrome c from heart tissue of the great grey kangaroo, Macropus canguru, has been established from the structures of the chymotryptic peptides and the amino acid compositions and partial sequences of the tryptic peptides. This primary structure bears all of the characteristics of the cytochromes c of the mammalian type, showing the typical clustered distribution of hydrophobic and basic residues, a single polypeptide chain 104 residues long, and, like other cytochromes c from vertebrate species, an acetylated amino-terminal residue. Position 33 is occupied by an asparaginyl residue as contrasted to the histidine occurring at this location in all but one of the other cytochromes c of known amino acid sequence. Kangaroo heart cytochrome c differs from the horse, human, pig, cow, chicken, tuna, moth, and bakers' yeast proteins by 7, 10, 6, 6, 12, 20, 29, and 45 residues, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1604461865,"Abstract Swelling of liver mitochondria induced by thyroxine in isotonic KCl medium can be prevented by uncoupling phosphorylation or by blocking the electron transport chain. Experiments with inhibitors for different points in electron transport (cyanide, antimycin A, Amytal, rotenone), with oxidation-reduction dyes which create bypasses of these blocked points (2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, methylene blue, and phenazine methosulfate), and with other artificial electron donors and acceptors have demonstrated that any one of the three energy conservation sites associated with electron transport can by itself support swelling induced by thyroxine. The requirement would appear to be for formation of a high energy intermediate and not specific for any particular point, such as the cytochrome b segment. Induction of swelling with thyroxine shows certain similarities to that with gramicidin, such as inhibition by sucrose. Further work is needed to determine whether ion transport is involved."

https://openalex.org/W1510713257,"Abstract The equilibrium reaction rates of the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase reaction catalyzed by the crystalline enzyme from Clostridium cylindrosporum were determined by measuring the rates of exchange at equilibrium of formate ↔ 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, orthophosphate ↔ adenosine triphosphate, and ADP ↔ ATP. The effects of increasing the concentrations of the reactant pairs ADP and ATP, Pi and ATP, formate and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and tetrahydrofolate and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate were examined. The results were not consistent with an ordered addition of substrates, but were explained by a random mechanism. In addition, the results indicate that in some cases the binding of a substrate to the enzyme is affected by the presence of other substrates. The absence of a large difference between the exchange rates when all reactants are present in saturating concentrations suggests that the rate of interconversion of the quaternary complexes and the rates of dissociation of all the reactants from the enzyme are of the same order of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W1513466049,"Abstract Measurements are made of the change in the H+ concentration of unbuffered ribonuclease solutions caused by the addition of various competitive inhibitors at the same pH. By adjustment of the pH back to the initial value, the H+ taken up or released per mole of enzyme is measured. Above pH 5.5, mixtures of RNase and 2'-cytidylate become more alkaline than the separate solutions, whereas below pH 5.5, the mixtures become more acidic. At pH 5.5, where RNase-nucleotide complexes are most stable, the H+ concentration remains unchanged. Just above or below this pH, small changes in the pH are noted until 1 mole of 2'-cytidylate per mole of RNase is added; thereafter the pH remains constant. A greater excess of nucleotide must be added in order to reach maximum H+ uptake above pH 6 or maximal H+ release below pH 5. The addition of a 4-fold excess of 2'-cytidylate to 1.6 x 10-4 m RNase causes an uptake of about 1.4 H+ per mole of RNase at pH 7 and a release of about 1.1 H+ per mole of RNase at pH 4. At very high concentrations of cytidylate, the uptake in alkaline ranges approaches 2 H+ per mole of enzyme. Similar, but much weaker, changes in the H+ concentration are noted when 2'-cytidylate is added to guanidinated RNase, whereas none take place when it is added to carboxymethylhistidine-119-RNase. Proton uptake above pH 5.5 and release below pH 5.5 occurs upon addition to RNase of 3'-uridylate and 2'-adenylate, as well as of a number of non-nucleotide inhibitors bearing a terminal phosphate group. The pH at which no H+ uptake or release takes place is about 5.5, regardless of the dissociation constants of the phosphate groups involved. No change in the pH is caused by addition of nucleosides or nonsubstrate nucleoside cyclic phosphates. Addition of sulfate or trimetaphosphate, which are incapable of partial protonation, to RNase causes only a weak H+ uptake, which is greatest at pH 5.5. Polyglucose sulfate causes a large H+ uptake but also precipitates the enzyme. These results are interpreted in terms of equilibria between various ionized forms of the binding site of the enzyme, only one of which is able to form a stable complex with the phosphate group of the inhibitor. As a result of complex formation, displacement of the equilibrium between the various ionized species would cause H+ uptake above, and H+ release below, the pH at which the binding species predominates. The two groups at the binding site are estimated to have pK values of about 5.1 and 6.1, respectively. The excess H+ uptake on the alkaline side of the pH of maximal binding indicates that an additional protonation of either the phosphate group or the binding site is also involved in complex formation. Interactions involving both electrostatic and hydrogen bonding between the phosphate group and the binding site appear to explain the considerable stability of RNase-nucleotide complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1565540745,"Abstract The inhibition by nucleocidin of amino acid incorporation into protein exhibited the following characteristics. 1. Inhibition occurs at a stage subsequent to the formation of aminoacyl-soluble ribonucleic acid (S-RNA). The transfer of labeled amino acid from S-RNA to protein is inhibited by nucleocidin, but only in the presence of pH 5 fraction. 2. Nucleocidin inhibits labeling of peptides associated with polyribosomes but has no effect on the release of prelabeled peptides from ribosomes. Prior incubation with nucleocidin does not inhibit the release of labeled peptides from ribosomes when puromycin is added to the reaction mixture. 3. There is an appreciable lag period before inhibition is observed, indicating a requirement for a process which is slow relative to peptide bond formation. Prior incubation of the system with nucleocidin eliminates the lag period and strikingly enhances inhibition of incorporation; all components of the incorporating system must be present during the preliminary incubation for these effects to occur. 4. Ribosomes reisolated after incubation with nucleocidin are less active in the transfer reaction; this inhibition is reversible and the reversal is stimulated by addition of pH 5 fraction. 5. Nucleocidin does not inhibit the binding of 32P-S-RNA to ribosomes. A previous observation which indicated that nucleocidin inhibited the binding of 3H-leucyl-S-RNA was repeated, but it appears that calculation of the radioactivity removed by treatment with hot trichloroacetic acid probably does not give a valid estimate of the effects of inhibitors on S-RNA binding to ribosomes. 6. Incorporation of amino acid stimulated by a synthetic polynucleotide is inhibited by nucleocidin to the same extent as unstimulated incorporation. 7. Nucleocidin is the most potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in vivo of any antibiotic reported thus far, although it exhibits no greater potency in vitro. 8. Comparisons with reports of the effects of other antibiotics on amino acid incorporation into protein in vitro and in vivo indicate that the mechanism of action of nucleocidin differs from those reported for any other antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W1570736825,"Abstract The order of binding of the substrates to formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase from Clostridium cylindrosporum was examined by determining the initial velocity of the reaction under varied conditions of substrate and product concentrations. The data from experiments in which the changing fixed substrate was varied in concentration from a value below its Km to a saturating concentration gave intersecting plots of 1/v against 1/s. The results indicate that the substrates bind in a random fashion and that all substrates must be bound before any products are released. In addition, the binding constants of the substrates in the ternary complexes are slightly different from those in the quaternary complex. Inhibition by the three products was examined under varied conditions of substrate concentrations, and the results were found to be most consistent with a random mechanism in which certain dead end complexes are formed. Under some conditions orthophosphate showed uncompetitive inhibition. This finding indicates that the inhibition by orthophosphate is more than simple product inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2038955736,"A fluorometric-analysis procedure, used to quantitate indoles, confirmed the presence of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in an arachnid; there was unimodal cyclic production of 5-HT in brain and intestinal tissues over a 24-hour period. The same tissues produced 5-HT after 80-day culture; bimodal cyclic output was indicated during continuous 24-hour study. One peak occurred at 0200 hours, at the same time as the peak in vivo, suggesting an endogenously controlled mechanism of secretion. The second peak occurred at midmorning, a time when production in vivo was lowest, suggesting that there is a possible feedback-control mechanism in the organism that inhibits the endogenous output of 5-HT."
https://openalex.org/W1536702702,"Abstract 1. Formation of 11 sugar nucleotides from the respective nucleoside triphosphates and sugar 1-phosphates have been demonstrated with the crude extract of Azotobacter vinelandii. These are adenosine diphosphate glucose, cytidine diphosphate glucose, uridine diphosphate glucose, deoxythymidine diphosphate glucose, adenosine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine, deoxythymidine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine, adenosine diphosphate glucosamine, cytidine diphosphate glucosamine, uridine diphosphate glucosamine, and deoxythymidine diphosphate glucosamine. 2. The CDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity has been resolved into two peaks (Fractions I and II) by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. 3. One of these fractions (Fraction I: Michaelis constant (Km) for cytidine triphosphate = 3.3 x 10-3 m) is accompanied by a predominant UDP-glucosamine pyrophosphorylase activity (Km for uridine triphosphate = 1.9 x 10-4 m), and the ratio of the two activities (1:26) did not vary during the purification and inactivation at 50°. It seems likely that both activities are catalyzed by the same enzyme. 4. Another fraction (Fraction II) has been purified 195-fold. The purified enzyme is specific for both nucleoside triphosphate and sugar 1-phosphate except glucosamine 1-phosphate, which is active in replacing the glucose 1-phosphate. The pH optimum of the reaction is 8.5, and its equilibrium constant measured in the direction of CDP-glucose synthesis is 0.57. The enzyme absolutely requires Mg++ ions for activity. Variation of the Mg++ ion concentration relative to either pyrophosphate or CTP has a marked influence on the reaction velocity as well as Km values for the substrates. Km values calculated for pyrophosphate and CTP are 5.6 x 10-4 m and 7 x 10-4 m, respectively, when the molar ratio of MgCl2 to the substrate is 2:1. 5. The enzyme (Fraction II) is inhibited by its products, CDP-glucose and pyrophosphate. The inhibition by CDP-glucose is strictly competitive with respect to CTP, whereas that by pyrophosphate is noncompetitive. 6. Deoxythymidine triphosphate is a strong inhibitor of the enzyme (Fraction II). It is competitive with CTP only partially, indicating that dTTP combines with a site other than the CTP-binding site. 7. The cytidine nucleotides, isolated from A. vinelandii and tentatively identified as cytidine diphosphate 2-O-methyldeoxyaldose and its carboxylic acid ester, also inhibit the enzyme (Fraction II). Plots of percentage inhibition against inhibitor concentration give sigmoid curves."

https://openalex.org/W1513586725,"Abstract Parathyroid hormone added in vitro stimulates mitochondrial respiration in the complete absence of magnesium and phosphate. This response is completely blocked by the addition of magnesium, but not phosphate, and does not appear related to ion transport. However, when phosphate is added to the magnesium-inhibited system, the respiratory response to hormone is restored. Under these conditions the respiration is coupled to the translocation of magnesium phosphate. Neither sodium nor potassium ions are necessary for the hormonal responses, and their complete replacement with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane greatly improves hormone-dependent accumulation of magnesium phosphate. It is suggested that magnesium is necessary to couple the parathyroid hormone system to ion translocation in the mitochondria, and that, in its absence, the hormone acts as an uncoupler of oxidation from phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1515186293,"Abstract In addition to stimulating ion transport and respiration, it is now established that the parathyroid hormone induces rapid and extensive mitochondrial swelling. The swelling process takes place in the absence of Mg++ in a medium composed of sucrose, substrate, and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. If Mg++ is present, the swelling change is greatly minimized. The swelling is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in pyridine nucleotide oxidation and respiration, and is neither dependent upon nor enhanced by K+ or Na+. Inorganic phosphate, acetate, and, to a lesser extent, arsenate stimulate the rapidity and extent of the parathyroid hormone-induced swelling. The results suggest that parathyroid hormone-induced swelling is closely related to the ion transport and respiration responses."

Both the solution gelatin and gel spheres, which are readily permeable to the enzyme, follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent rate constants for dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complexes to hydrolysis products are essentially the same for both solution gelatin and spheres, an indication that gel structure in this system has a negligible influence on reaction rate once the enzyme forms a complex with the substrate. In contrast, the Michaelis constant for the gel system is greater than that for solutions below the melting point of the gel; this difference disappears as the melting point of the gel is approached."
https://openalex.org/W1600810560,"Abstract The occurrence of imine formation at the active site of acetoacetate decarboxylase and several aldolases prompted an attempt to demonstrate this mechanism in the formally similar isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. Although treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase with NaBH4 in the presence of α-ketoglutarate resulted in inactivation of the enzyme, reduction in the presence of labeled α-ketoglutarate did not yield labeled protein, nor was inactivation dependent on NADPH which is required for the enzymic β-H exchange of α-ketoglutarate. A study of the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction in H218O was made possible by the observation that decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate by H2O2 was faster than spontaneous exchange of the keto group with the medium. It was shown that succinate produced from enzymically formed α-ketoglutarate contained considerably less than 1 atom of 18O. It was concluded that this finding is not compatible with a mechanism of imine formation between keto intermediates (oxalosuccinate) and amino groups at the active site, since decarboxylation and hydrolysis of the imine to release α-ketoglutarate would have introduced 1 atom of 18O."

Significant inhibition of CO2 production and lipogenesis from acetate-1-14C and pyruvate-2-14C occurred in the presence of 1.6 µm vasopressin, in rat liver slices and in homogenates. 2. This effect cannot be reproduced by cyclic adenosine monophosphate, nor can it be accounted for by lipolysis or by glycogenolysis-induced dilution of a precursor pool. 3. Vasopressin has no significant effect on lipogenesis from citrate-1,5-14C and stimulates the formation of fatty acids from acetyl-1-14C-coenzyme A, in rat liver homogenates. 4. The failure of vasopressin to inhibit acetylhydroxamate formation as well as the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis from acetate-1-14C in a mitochondria-free homogenate, focuses attention on the mitochondria as a possible site of action of vasopressin in inhibiting lipogenesis. 5.
