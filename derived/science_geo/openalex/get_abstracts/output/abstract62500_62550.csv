https://openalex.org/W1578231679,"Abstract Cytidine deaminase (cytidine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.5) has been purified approximately 160-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli B. The enzyme shows constant activity between pH 6 and 11. No significant change in rate is observed when D2O replaces water as the solvent. In addition to the deamination of cytidine, the purified deaminase catalyzes slow hydrolysis of N4-methylcytidine. The enzyme is competitively inhibited by 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine, previously shown to inhibit the deamination of 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine by preparations of human liver. The bacterial enzyme exhibits an affinity for this inhibitor exceeding by more than four orders of magnitude its combined affinity for the products uridine and ammonia."

Spindle tension has been detected2,3 and could be due to some other component pulling the chromosomes over the rigid microtubular framework."

https://openalex.org/W1549076646,"Abstract The effect of some antibiotics on several steps of protein biosynthesis was examined. Thiostrepton and siomycin A inhibited translocation through interference with ribosomal function; they also inhibited Phe-tRNA binding to ribosomes and GTP hydrolysis dependent on ribosomes and factor G. Micrococcin inhibited translocation, but did not inhibit either the associated GTP hydrolysis or Phe-tRNA binding to ribosomes. Althiomycin appeared to inhibit transpeptidation, although the inhibition was substrate-dependent: it inhibited peptidyl transfer to C-A-C-C-A(Phe), but did not inhibit either acetyl-phenylalanyl-puromycin formation or GTP hydrolysis dependent on factor G and ribosomes. Bottromycin A2, carbomycin, chloramphenicol, griseoviridin, and lincomycin inhibited acetyl-phenylalanyl-puromycin formation, but not GTP hydrolysis dependent on ribosomes and factor G. It appeared that inhibitors of transpeptidation and some inhibitors of translocation (micrococcin for example) can uncouple GTP hydrolysis from functional translocation."

If an observer views an event which produces a sound it seems that some compensation is made for the fact that the event will stimulate the eye somewhat before it will stimulate the ear depending on the distance of the event from the observer. For example, the sound of an event 35 m away will arrive at the ear about 100 ms after the light arrives at the eye."
https://openalex.org/W1499805402,"Abstract The molecular weight of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli is 74,000 by Sephadex gel filtration and 81,000 by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Both sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and agarose gel filtration in 8 m urea reveal subunits of 37,000 in molecular weight. In addition only one protein band is observed after polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis in the presence if 8 m urea. By these criteria the enzyme is a dimer composed of subunits identical in mass and charge. The enzyme catalyzes synthesis of the unusual product, tryptophanyl adenosine triphosphate ester (tryptophanyl-ATP). In attempts to form complexes with tryptophan, ATP, and enzyme we recovered the enzyme in a complex with tryptophanyl-ATP, 1.7 to 1.8 moles of tryptophanyl-ATP per mole of active enzyme. A symmetric dimer model was supported by studies with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The reagent detected two sulfhydryl groups per mole of enzyme, and both thiols reacted with the same first order rate constant. The sulfhydryl groups were essential for enzymatic activity and were protected from 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) by tryptophan and ATP together but not individually. A complex of tryptophanyl-tRNA-enzyme (0.9:1.0) is isolable by sucrose gradient centrifugation."

https://openalex.org/W1571583008,"Abstract The effects of several antibiotics on polyribosome levels and protein synthesis on polyribosomes were examined in cell-free extracts from Escherichia coli. Three ribosomal inhibitors of translocation, thiostrepton, siomycin A, and micrococcin, inhibited polyribosome breakdown. Protein synthesis by these polysomes was also inhibited by these antibiotics as well as by althiomycin. Micrococcin, as well as fusidic acid and vernamycin A, however, did not inhibit the rate of peptidyl-puromycin formation on these polyribosomes; thiostrepton and siomycin A did slightly; and althiomycin was a strong inhibitor. The results are in accordance with the following conclusions based on additional evidence: micrococcin, thiostrepton, and siomycin A are ribosomal inhibitors of translocation; althiomycin inhibits transpeptidation; and vernamycin A in vivo inhibits initiation or an early step of protein synthesis. Additionally, a model of ribosomal sites in which the two sites on the 50 S subunit are equivalent with respect to peptidyl-puromycin formation is consistent with the data presented."
https://openalex.org/W2087941203,"REPORTS1,2 that live larvae of the nematode Anisakis from raw or inadequately cooked fish may cause eosinophilic granuloma of the alimentary tract in man have stimulated research into the ecology, taxonomy, physiology and pathogenesis of this genus in fish (natural second intermediate hosts), marine mammals (natural final hosts) and man and laboratory animals (abnormal hosts)3,4. But little attention has been paid to earlier stages in the life cycle or to a search for first intermediate hosts, A knowledge of early developmental stages of Anisakis might contribute to an understanding of geographical and other variations in abundance of the larvae in economically important fish. Uspenskaya5 reported larval Anisakis in one of 855 specimens of the amphipod Caprella septentrionalis Krøyer, 1838, in one of 990 specimens of the decapod Hyasaraneus (L.) and in one of an unspecified number of euphausiids Thysanoessa raschii (M. Sars, 1864) from the Barents Sea. Oshima et al.6 found five larvae in 3,247 specimens of T. raschii and T. longipes Brandt, 1851, collected in the northern North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Kagei7, according to Gibson4, mentioned T. inermis (Krøyer, 1846) as a first intermediate host of Anisakis."
https://openalex.org/W1588864478,"Abstract We have investigated, with the use of the four isomers of 2-aminonorbornane-2-carboxylic acid, the stereochemical specificity shown by several cell types for transporting amino acids with large, apolar side chains. The degree of specificity observed varied from low to high. The isomer of the model amino acid with carboxyl group exo and with configuration 1S was excreted by the rat more rapidly than its optical antipode, whereas the distribution of the two isomers in eight tissues of that animal was nearly the same. Although the kinetic constants for the uptake of the racemic, geometric isomers in the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell were different, the latter two enantiomorphs seemed to be transported by the same route. The hamster small intestine took up the two geometric isomers at similar rates, whereas both rates and inhibitory profiles for the two carboxyl-exo isomers showed that they were not taken up extensively by the same system. These two isomers were, however, absorbed from the gut at similar rates in the intact hamster. Only the isomer with carboxyl group exo and with configuration 1R was transported by Escherichia coli K-12, the same isomer being by far the most strongly bound to a binding protein for amino acids isolated from that cell. This isomer of 2-aminonorbornane-2-carboxylic acid inhibited at most only 75 to 80% of the uptake of either isoleucine or leucine, although the last two amino acids inhibited completely and homogeneously the uptake of the norbornyl amino acid. The nature of each of these inhibitory actions suggested that the synthetic amino acid can serve as a model substrate specific to a single route of entry serving for leucine and isoleucine, a conclusion supported by its failure to inhibit the component of uptake of leucine retained in the presence of isoleucine. Furthermore, the structural rigidity of the norbornyl amino acid permitted a partial description of a biochemical recognition site serving for transport into E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1599178671,Abstract l-Asparaginase from Escherichia coli B has a fluorescence maximum at 320 nm in addition to shoulders at 307 and 325 nm. Reversible dissociation of the tetrameric aggregate in 3.2 m urea is accompanied by the loss of the 320 nm emission band and the appearance of a band at 305 nm due to tyrosine and one at 345 nm characteristic of tryptophan in aqueous solution. Shifts in the ultraviolet absorption spectrum also accompany dissociation into subunits. The rate of dissociation was monitored by the absorption and emission properties. The rate was found to be independent of enzyme concentration and is roughly dependent on the twelfth power of the urea concentration. Enhancement of the rate of dissociation by alcohols was related to the length of the alkyl chain. The tetramer is rapidly and irreversibly dissociated by 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate into monomeric subunits. Changes in the emission and absorption spectra indicate that detergent binds in the vicinity of tyrosyl and tryptophyl residues.

https://openalex.org/W1515588038,"Abstract Lysine-specific tRNA was isolated from the genetically defined, haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae αS288C. In conditions of optimum cell growth more than 90% of this RNA was shown to consist of a single species of polynucleotide. The nucleotide sequence of the lysine tRNA was determined by use of 32P-labeled material. The tRNA chain, 76 nucleotide residues in length, was found to contain the anticodon sequence C-U-U. In experiments to determine coding specificity, [14C]lysyl-tRNA from αS288C showed the greatest response with the codon A-A-G."
https://openalex.org/W1995495415,Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae is highly resistant to streptomycin. A histidine auxotroph was found which could grow without histidine in the presence of high concentrations of streptomycin. Selection for derivatives of this strain which could be suppressed by much lower concentrations of streptomycin yielded streptomycin-sensitive mutants which are cold-sensitive and have altered ribosomal profiles.
https://openalex.org/W1510843987,"Abstract In rabbit reticulocyte protein synthesis, Met-tRNAfmet (liver) can recognize the terminal AUG and GUG codons. The preferential recognition of the terminal methionine codons (AUG and GUG) by Met-tRNAfmet (liver) requires the presence of a peptide chain initiation factor or factors and low Mg++. Both Met-tRNAfmet and Met-tRNAmmet can recognize internal AUG codons, although the affinity of Met-tRNAmmet for the same codons is greater than that of Met-tRNAfmet. When both Met-tRNAmet species are present in excess, Met-tRNAmmet preferentially transfers methionine into polypeptides in response to internal AUG codons. Met-tRNAmmet and not Met-tRNAfmet can recognize internal GUG codons. However, this recognition of internal GUG codons by Met-tRNAmmet (liver) requires a higher Mg++ concentration (9 mm). Yeast Met-tRNAfmet, like the liver Met-tRNAfmet, can also recognize the terminal AUG and GUG codons and can transfer methionine into the terminal positions of the peptide chains in the presence of the peptide chain initiation factors at low Mg++. However, yeast Met-tRNAfmet does not efficiently recognize the internal AUG codons. On the other hand, Escherichia coli Met-tRNAfmet transfers methionine very efficiently in response to internal AUG codons, although the transfer efficiency of methionine into polypeptides by this species in response to terminal AUG and GUG codons is comparatively low."

https://openalex.org/W1592043406,"The equilibrium of hydrolytic deamination of cytidine to uridine and ammonia has been investigated in the presence of bacterial cytidine deaminase. At pH 7.0 and ionic strength 2.0, the apparent free energy of deamination of cytidine is -5.8 kcal per mole at 25°. N4-Methylcytidine is thermodynamically more stable to hydrolysis than cytidine, and cytidine deaminase catalyzes its formation in appreciable yield from uridine and methylamine at alkaline pH."

https://openalex.org/W1652976085,"Abstract The effects of various chemical and enzymatic treatments on the biological activity of porcine luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), which were performed before the elucidation of the structure of this hormone, are described. LH-RH activity was abolished by the following endopeptidases: chymotrypsin, subtilisin, papain, and thermolysin, but not by pepsin or trypsin. Exopeptidases did not affect LH-RH activity, but a purified preparation of pyrolidone carboxylpeptidase did. Treatment with various chemical reagents showed that tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan, and arginine in LH-RH are important for its biological activity. Nitrous acid and Edman degradation did not inactivate LH-RH. The results are in agreement with the determined structure of LH-RH. This hormone also showed a high follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone activity. The inactivation of LH-RH was always accompanied by a loss of follicle-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone activity. These experiments also shed some light on the structure-activity relationship of this hormone."

This proposal was supported by observations that 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) could specifically suppress the excitation by acetylcholine of cerebral cortical neurones in the cat without affecting the excitatory action of L-glutamate, and that the hyperpolarization of these neurones by DNP involved an increase in the membrane conductance for potassium ions3."
