https://openalex.org/W4212766227,"Posttranslational modifications of histone N-terminal tails impact chromatin structure and gene transcription. While the extent of histone acetylation is determined by both acetyltransferases and deacetylases, it has been unclear whether histone methylation is also regulated by enzymes with opposing activities. Here, we provide evidence that LSD1 (KIAA0601), a nuclear homolog of amine oxidases, functions as a histone demethylase and transcriptional corepressor. LSD1 specifically demethylates histone H3 lysine 4, which is linked to active transcription. Lysine demethylation occurs via an oxidation reaction that generates formaldehyde. Importantly, RNAi inhibition of LSD1 causes an increase in H3 lysine 4 methylation and concomitant derepression of target genes, suggesting that LSD1 represses transcription via histone demethylation. The results thus identify a histone demethylase conserved from S. pombe to human and reveal dynamic regulation of histone methylation by both histone methylases and demethylases."

https://openalex.org/W2023179463,"Formation of synaptic connections requires alignment of neurotransmitter receptors on postsynaptic dendrites opposite matching transmitter release sites on presynaptic axons. beta-neurexins and neuroligins form a trans-synaptic link at glutamate synapses. We show here that neurexin alone is sufficient to induce glutamate postsynaptic differentiation in contacting dendrites. Surprisingly, neurexin also induces GABA postsynaptic differentiation. Conversely, neuroligins induce presynaptic differentiation in both glutamate and GABA axons. Whereas neuroligins-1, -3, and -4 localize to glutamate postsynaptic sites, neuroligin-2 localizes primarily to GABA synapses. Direct aggregation of neuroligins reveals a linkage of neuroligin-2 to GABA and glutamate postsynaptic proteins, but the other neuroligins only to glutamate postsynaptic proteins. Furthermore, mislocalized expression of neuroligin-2 disperses postsynaptic proteins and disrupts synaptic transmission. Our findings indicate that the neurexin-neuroligin link is a core component mediating both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptogenesis, and differences in isoform localization and binding affinities may contribute to appropriate differentiation and specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2128786355,"Although germline cells can form multipotential embryonic stem (ES)/embryonic germ (EG) cells, these cells can be derived only from embryonic tissues, and such multipotent cells have not been available from neonatal gonads. Here we report the successful establishment of ES-like cells from neonatal mouse testis. These ES-like cells were phenotypically similar to ES/EG cells except in their genomic imprinting pattern. They differentiated into various types of somatic cells in vitro under conditions used to induce the differentiation of ES cells and produced teratomas after inoculation into mice. Furthermore, these ES-like cells formed germline chimeras when injected into blastocysts. Thus, the capacity to form multipotent cells persists in neonatal testis. The ability to derive multipotential stem cells from the neonatal testis has important implications for germ cell biology and opens the possibility of using these cells for biotechnology and medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2143441775,"Diverse microbial communities and numerous energy-yielding activities occur in deeply buried sediments of the eastern Pacific Ocean. Distributions of metabolic activities often deviate from the standard model. Rates of activities, cell concentrations, and populations of cultured bacteria vary consistently from one subseafloor environment to another. Net rates of major activities principally rely on electron acceptors and electron donors from the photosynthetic surface world. At open-ocean sites, nitrate and oxygen are supplied to the deepest sedimentary communities through the underlying basaltic aquifer. In turn, these sedimentary communities may supply dissolved electron donors and nutrients to the underlying crustal biosphere."

https://openalex.org/W1980303046,"The CREB transcription factor regulates differentiation, survival, and synaptic plasticity. The complement of CREB targets responsible for these responses has not been identified, however. We developed a novel approach to identify CREB targets, termed serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO), by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with a modification of SAGE. Using a SACO library derived from rat PC12 cells, we identified approximately 41,000 genomic signature tags (GSTs) that mapped to unique genomic loci. CREB binding was confirmed for all loci supported by multiple GSTs. Of the 6302 loci identified by multiple GSTs, 40% were within 2 kb of the transcriptional start of an annotated gene, 49% were within 1 kb of a CpG island, and 72% were within 1 kb of a putative cAMP-response element (CRE). A large fraction of the SACO loci delineated bidirectional promoters and novel antisense transcripts. This study represents the most comprehensive definition of transcription factor binding sites in a metazoan species."
https://openalex.org/W2020726089,"The regulation of ribosome biogenesis in response to environmental conditions is a key aspect of cell growth control. Ribosomal protein (RP) genes are regulated by the nutrient-sensitive, conserved target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. TOR controls the subcellular localization of protein kinase A (PKA) and the PKA-regulated kinase YAK1. However, the target transcription factor(s) of the TOR-PKA pathway are unknown. We show that regulation of RP gene transcription via TOR and PKA in yeast involves the Forkhead-like transcription factor FHL1 and the two cofactors IFH1 (a coactivator) and CRF1 (a corepressor). TOR, via PKA, negatively regulates YAK1 and maintains CRF1 in the cytoplasm. Upon TOR inactivation, activated YAK1 phosphorylates and activates CRF1. Phosphorylated CRF1 accumulates in the nucleus and competes with IFH1 for binding to FHL1 at RP gene promoters, and thereby inhibits transcription of RP genes. Thus, we describe a signaling mechanism linking an environmental sensor to ribosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2099016813,"Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, we examined the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system biology. We found that these genes display significantly higher rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. Importantly, this trend is most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein evolution is most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral primates to humans. Thus, the remarkable phenotypic evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate, i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those linked to nervous system development. In addition to uncovering broad evolutionary trends, our study also identified many candidate genes—most of which are implicated in regulating brain size and behavior—that might have played important roles in the evolution of the human brain."

We used in situ hybridization to map the expression of over 1000 of these TFs and TF-coregulator genes in the brains of developing mice. We found that 349 of these genes showed restricted expression patterns that were adequate to describe the anatomical organization of the brain. We provide a comprehensive inventory of murine TFs and their expression patterns in a searchable brain atlas database."

https://openalex.org/W2047669024,"The ablation of the protein kinase Raf-1 renders cells hypersensitive to apoptosis despite normal regulation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases, which suggests that apoptosis protection is mediated by a distinct pathway. We used proteomic analysis of Raf-1 signaling complexes to show that Raf-1 counteracts apoptosis by suppressing the activation of mammalian sterile 20–like kinase (MST2). Raf-1 prevents dimerization and phosphorylation of the activation loop of MST2 independently of its protein kinase activity. Depletion of MST2 from Raf-1 –/– mouse or human cells abrogated sensitivity to apoptosis, whereas overexpression of MST2 induced apoptosis. Conversely, depletion of Raf-1 from Raf-1 +/+ mouse or human cells led to MST2 activation and apoptosis. The concomitant depletion of both Raf-1 and MST2 prevented apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2053996795,"Binding of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) to Patched (Ptc) relieves the latter's tonic inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), a receptor that spans the cell membrane seven times. This initiates signaling which, by unknown mechanisms, regulates vertebrate developmental processes. We find that two molecules interact with mammalian Smo in an activation-dependent manner: G protein–coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) leads to phosphorylation of Smo, and β-arrestin 2 fused to green fluorescent protein interacts with Smo. These two processes promote endocytosis of Smo in clathrin-coated pits. Ptc inhibits association of β-arrestin 2 with Smo, and this inhibition is relieved in cells treated with Shh. A Smo agonist stimulated and a Smo antagonist (cyclopamine) inhibited both phosphorylation of Smo by GRK2 and interaction of β-arrestin 2 with Smo. β-Arrestin 2 and GRK2 are thus potential mediators of signaling by activated Smo."
https://openalex.org/W2132811048,"P-type ATPases extract energy by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in two steps, formation and breakdown of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate. This process drives active transport and countertransport of the cation pumps. We have determined the crystal structure of rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase in complex with aluminum fluoride, which mimics the transition state of hydrolysis of the counterion-bound (protonated) phosphoenzyme. On the basis of structural analysis and biochemical data, we find this form to represent an occluded state of the proton counterions. Hydrolysis is catalyzed by the conserved Thr-Gly-Glu-Ser motif, and it exploits an associative nucleophilic reaction mechanism of the same type as phosphoryl transfer from ATP. On this basis, we propose a general mechanism of occluded transition states of Ca2+ transport and H+ countertransport coupled to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2055668479,"A full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulation of a hydrogen atom reacting with methane on an accurate ab initio potential energy surface is reported. Based on first-principles theory, thermal rate constants are predicted with an accuracy comparable to (or even exceeding) experimental precision. The theoretical prediction is within the range of the significantly varied experimental rate constants reported by different groups. This level of accuracy has previously been achieved only for smaller, three-or four-atom reactive systems. Comparison with classical transition state theory confirms the importance of quantum mechanical tunneling for the rate constant below 400 kelvin."
https://openalex.org/W1987362169,"Epigenetic mechanisms silence the HM mating-type loci in budding yeast. These loci are tightly linked to telomeres, which are also repressed and held together in clusters at the nuclear periphery, much like mammalian heterochromatin. Yeast telomere anchoring can occur in the absence of silent chromatin through the DNA end binding factor Ku. Here we examine whether silent chromatin binds the nuclear periphery independently of telomeres and whether silencing persists in the absence of anchorage. HMR was excised from the chromosome by inducible site-specific recombination and tracked by real-time fluorescence microscopy. Silent rings associate with the nuclear envelope, while nonsilent rings move freely throughout the nucleus. Silent chromatin anchorage requires the action of either Ku or Esc1. In the absence of both proteins, rings move throughout the nucleoplasm yet remain silent. Thus, transcriptional repression can be sustained without perinuclear anchoring."
https://openalex.org/W2050478106,"Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly infectious human pathogen; nevertheless, infectious virions are not released in vitro where infection is cell associated. Four VZV envelope glycoproteins contain mannose 6-phosphate (Man 6-P), and Man 6-P blocks infection of cells by cell-free VZV. Expression of antisense cDNA or siRNA-like transcripts were used to generate five stable human cell lines deficient in cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRci). All 5 MPRci-deficient lines resisted infection by cell-free, but not cell-associated, VZV, secreted lysosomal enzymes, and released infectious virions when infected by cell-associated VZV. Intracellular MPRci thus appear to divert newly enveloped VZV to late endosomes, and plasmalemmal MPRci are necessary for entry by cell-free VZV. Biopsies from VZV-infected human skin supported the idea that because MPRci expression is naturally lost in maturing superficial epidermal cells, these cells do not divert VZV to endosomes and constitutively secrete infectious VZV."
https://openalex.org/W2009358682,"A major focus of genome research is to decipher the networks of molecular interactions that underlie cellular function. We describe a computational approach for identifying detailed relationships between proteins on the basis of genomic data. Logic analysis of phylogenetic profiles identifies triplets of proteins whose presence or absence obey certain logic relationships. For example, protein C may be present in a genome only if proteins A and B are both present. The method reveals many previously unidentified higher order relationships. These relationships illustrate the complexities that arise in cellular networks because of branching and alternate pathways, and they also facilitate assignment of cellular functions to uncharacterized proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2154898126,"The yeast MAPK pathways required for mating versus filamentous growth share multiple components yet specify distinct programs. The mating-specific MAPK, Fus3, prevents crosstalk between the two pathways by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that pheromone signaling induces Fus3-dependent degradation of Tec1, the transcription factor specific to the filamentation pathway. Degradation requires Fus3 kinase activity and a MAPK phosphorylation site in Tec1 at threonine 273. Fus3 associates with Tec1 in unstimulated cells, and active Fus3 phosphorylates Tec1 on T273 in vitro. Destruction of Tec1 requires the F box protein Dia2 (Digs-into-agar-2), and Cdc53, the Cullin of SCF (Skp1-Cdc53-F box) ubiquitin ligases. Notably, mutation of the phosphoacceptor site in Tec1, deletion of FUS3, or deletion of DIA2 results in a loss of signaling specificity such that pheromone pathway signaling erroneously activates filamentation pathway gene expression and invasive growth. Signal-induced destruction of a transcription factor for a competing pathway provides a mechanism for signaling specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2101824673,"Signaling specificity is fundamental for parallel mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades that control growth and differentiation in response to different stimuli. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, components of the pheromone-responsive MAPK cascade activate Fus3 and Kss1 MAPKs to induce mating and Kss1 to promote filamentation. Active Fus3 is required to prevent the activation of the filamentation program during pheromone response. How Fus3 prevents the crossactivation is not clear. Here we show that Tec1, a cofactor of Ste12 for the expression of filamentation genes, is rapidly degraded during pheromone response. Fus3 but not Kss1 induces Tec1 ubiquination and degradation through the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase. T273 in a predicted high-affinity Cdc4 binding motif is phosphorylated by Fus3 both in vitro and in vivo. Tec1T273V blocks Tec1 ubiquitination and degradation and allows the induction of filamentation genes in response to pheromone. Thus, Fus3 inhibits filamentous growth during mating by degrading Tec1."

https://openalex.org/W2105312336,"Toward the end of the breeding season, migratory songbirds face crucial tradeoffs between the timing of reproduction, molt, and migration. Using stable hydrogen isotopes, we show that male American redstarts investing in high levels of reproduction late in the season adopt a unique strategy of combining molt and migration. Tail feathers molted during migration also reflect less orange-red light, indicating reduced carotenoid concentration. Thus, we show how reproduction in a migratory animal can influence both life history strategies (location of molt) and social signals (feather color) during subsequent periods of the annual cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2057205050,"Meiotic recombination requires the meiosis-specific RecA homolog Dmc1 as well as the mitotic RecA homolog Rad51. Here, we show that the two meiosis-specific proteins Mei5 and Sae3 are necessary for the assembly of Dmc1, but not for Rad51, on chromosomes including the association of Dmc1 with a recombination hot spot. Mei5, Sae3, and Dmc1 form a ternary and evolutionary conserved complex that requires Rad51 for recruitment to chromosomes. Mei5, Sae3, and Dmc1 are mutually dependent for their chromosome association, and their absence prevents the disassembly of Rad51 filaments. Our results suggest that Mei5 and Sae3 are loading factors for the Dmc1 recombinase and that the Dmc1-Mei5-Sae3 complex is integrated onto Rad51 ensembles and, together with Rad51, plays both catalytic and structural roles in interhomolog recombination during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2052694810,"β-arrestins are multifunctional proteins that act as scaffolds and transducers of intracellular signals from heptahelical transmembrane-spanning receptors (7TMR). Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which uses the putative 7TMR, Smoothened, is established as a fundamental pathway in development, and unregulated Hh signaling is associated with certain malignancies. Here, we show that the functional knockdown of β-arrestin 2 in zebrafish embryos recapitulates the many phenotypes of Hh pathway mutants. Expression of wild-type β-arrestin 2, or constitutive activation of the Hh pathway downstream of Smoothened, rescues the phenotypes caused by β-arrestin 2 deficiency. These results suggest that a functional interaction between β-arrestin 2 and Smoothened may be critical to regulate Hh signaling in zebrafish development."

Cytolysin expression is regulated by one of the subunits (CylL S ″) through a quorum-sensing autoinduction mechanism. We found that when target cells are absent, the other subunit (CylL L ″) forms a complex with CylL S ″, blocking it from autoinducing the operon. When target cells are present, however, CylL L ″ binds preferentially to the target, allowing free CylL S ″ to accumulate above the induction threshold. Thus, enterococci use CylL L ″ to actively probe the environment for target cells, and when target cells are detected, allows the organism to express high levels of cytolysin in response."

Consequently, muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, obesity, and the blood-lipid profile. We utilize ectopic expression in skeletal muscle cells to understand the regulatory role of Rev-erbβ in this major mass peripheral tissue. Exogenous expression of a dominant negative version of mouse Rev-erbβ decreases the expression of many genes involved in fatty acid/lipid absorption (including Cd36, and Fabp-3 and -4).

RORα-deficient staggerer mice are predisposed to the development of atherosclerosis. The staggerer mice possess an aberrant blood-lipid profile with low circulating levels of major lipoproteins such as HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) C-III, and plasma triglycerides.

Skeletal muscle is one of the most metabolically demanding major mass peripheral tissues that accounts for 50% of energy expenditure. Moreover, this lean tissue relies heavily on fatty acids as an energy source, accounts for 75% of glucose disposal, and is involved in cholesterol efflux. Consequently, muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity and the blood-lipid profile. However, the role of Rev-erbβ in skeletal muscle lipid and energy homeostasis has not been well studied.The C2C12 in vitro cell culture model system has been used to investigate the regulation of lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis by nuclear receptors such as LXR (23Muscat G.E.

The physiological validation of the cell culture model with respect to lipid homeostasis in the mouse corroborates the utility of this model system. This cell culture model provides an ideal platform to identify the Rev-erbβ-dependent regulation of genes involved in metabolism.We have examined the regulation of gene expression involved in lipid homeostasis by Rev-erbβ “loss of function” in skeletal muscle cell culture model. Our investigation demonstrates that Rev-erbβ controls the expression of genes involved in lipid absorption. Moreover, we observed the regulation of genes encoding critical myokines that influence energy expenditure and inflammation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Mouse myogenic C2C12 cells were cultured in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Serum Supreme (BioWhittaker, Edward Keller Pty.

Myoblasts were differentiated into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by 4 days of serum withdrawal (i.e. cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum + 1% serum supreme). Cells were harvested 96 h (4 days) after mitogen withdrawal.C2C12 Transfections—Each well of a 24-well plate of C2C12 cells (∼50% confluence) was transfected with DNA using the liposome-mediated transfection procedure as described previously (16Lau P.

The DNA/DOTAP/Metafectene mixture was added to the cells in 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum for experiments with RORα or 10% serum supreme. After 16–24 h, the culture medium was changed and after a further 24 h the cells were harvested for the assay of luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured as described previously (16Lau P. Nixon S.J. Parton R.G. Muscat G.E. J. Biol.

Downes M. Carozzi A. Giguere V. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in growth medium with G418, and differentiated into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by 4 days of serum withdrawal.RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After treatment with 2 units of Turbo DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 60 min, DNase was inactivated by heating to 75 °C for 10 min. RNA for quantitative real time (Q-RT)-PCR was further purified using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Q-RT-PCR—RNA was normalized using UV spectrometry and agarose gel electrophoresis. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Australia Pty. Ltd., Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target cDNA levels were analyzed by Q-RT-PCR in 25-μl reactions containing either SYBR green (ABI, Warrington, UK) or Taqman PCR master mix (ABI, Branchburg, NJ), 200 nm each of forward and reverse primers or Assays-on-Demand Taqman primers (ABI, Foster City, CA), and cDNA (derived from 50 nanograms of RNA) by using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector system.

In this culture system, proliferating C2C12 myoblasts can be induced to biochemically and morphologically differentiate into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal in culture over a 48–96-h period. This transition from a non-muscle phenotype to a contractile phenotype is associated with activation/expression of a structurally diverse group of genes responsible for contraction and the extreme metabolic demands on this tissue.Initially, total RNA was isolated from proliferating myoblasts and post-mitotic myotubes after 4 days of serum withdrawal, converted to cDNA for the analysis of mRNA expression by Q-RT-PCR. We utilized the GenBank™ sequences of mouse Rev-erbβ to design specific primers for detection of mouse Rev-erbβ by Q-RT-PCR.We observed that Rev-erbβ is expressed in proliferating myoblasts and the transcript was decreased 2–3-fold as the cells exit the cell cycle and form differentiated multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1A). Concomitant with this decrease in Rev-erbβ mRNA was the striking induction of expression of mRNA that encodes the slow (type I, Tnni1) and fast (type II, Tnni2) isoforms of the contractile protein, troponin I, and myogenin that encodes the hierarchical basic helix loop helix regulator (Fig. 1, B–D). These data confirmed that these cells had terminally differentiated and had acquired a contractile phenotype.Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of several genes that encode major metabolic enzymes and regulators that are involved in the regulation of energy expenditure and lipid homeostasis (as described in Table I). Acquisition of the muscle-specific phenotype saw an increase in expression of mRNAs encoding lipoprotein lipase (Fig. 1E), RORα (Fig. 1F), fatty acid translocase/CD36 (Fat/Cd36, Fig. 1G), fatty acid binding proteins 3 and 4 (Fig. 1, H and I), and the uncoupling proteins (Ucp2 and -3, Fig. 1, K and L). Finally, there was no change in the expression of the mRNAs encoding Srebp-1c (Fig. 1M), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd-1, Fig. 1J), and adiponectin receptor 2 (adipoR2, Fig. 1N).Table IKey target genes in this studyMetabolic genesAbca1 and Abcg8ATP binding cassette proteins: transporters that transfer cholesterol to the HDL acceptors, i.e. reverse cholesterol effluxAcs4Acyl-CoA synthetase-4.

Second, during the acquisition of a contractile and metabolic phenotype (consistent with the increased utilization of lipids in skeletal muscle) we observed an ∼2.5-fold repression of this orphan NR. However, we note that Rev-erbβ is still expressed at a significant level in differentiated cells, in concordance with the expression of this orphan NR in adult muscle tissue.Deletion of the Rev-erbβ Ligand Binding Domain Compromises Its Ability to Repress RORα-mediated Trans-activation—To understand the metabolic role of Rev-erbβ in skeletal muscle lipid and energy homeostasis, and to identify target genes of this orphan receptor in muscle cells, we examined the effect of perturbing Rev-erbβ function. To disrupt Rev-erbβ-mediated trans-repression of gene expression, we utilized Rev-erbβΔE, that encodes amino acids 1–394 but lacks the entire E region that encodes the putative ligand binding domain of Rev-erbβ. Deletion of this region has been reported to have a dominant negative effect on Rev-erbβ-mediated trans-repression of gene expression (29Burke L. Downes M. Carozzi A. Giguere V. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this region has been implicated in associating with the nuclear receptor co-repressors (30Burke L.J. Downes M. Laudet V. Muscat G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 248-262PubMed Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells, deletion of the E region ablated the ability of Rev-erbβ to trans-repress the human Rev-erbAα promoter (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the capacity of Rev-erbβ to repress RORα-mediated transcription is diminished when the E region is absent (Fig. 2, B and C). This demonstrates that deletion of the E-region that encodes the ligand binding domain of Rev-erbβ compromises the capacity of this orphan NR to trans-repress the Rev-erbα promoter, and to attenuate RORα-mediated trans-activation.Fig. 2Deletion of the E region of Rev-erbβ compromises its trans-repression activity.A, C2C12 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the reporter, pRev-erbAαWT, and 0.16 μg each of pSG5, pSG5-Rev-erbβ, and pSG5-Rev-erbβΔE. -Fold repression is expressed relative to luciferase activity obtained after co-transfection of the reporter and pSG5 vector only, arbitrarily set at 1.

https://openalex.org/W2045962161,Earth's core is composed primarily of iron (Fe) with about 10% by weight of lighter elements. The lighter elements are progressively enriched in the liquid outer core as the core cools and the inner core crystallizes. Thermodynamic modeling of Fe-O-S liquids shows that immiscible liquids can exist at outer-core pressures (136 to 330 gigapascals) at temperatures below 5200 kelvin and lead to layering in the outer core if the concentrations of the lighter elements are high enough. We found no evidence for layering in the outer core in the travel times and wave forms of P 4 KP seismic waves that reflect internally in the core. The absence of layers therefore constrains outer-core compositions in the Fe-O-S system to be no richer than 6 ± 1 weight % (wt %) O and 2 to 15 wt % S. A single core liquid composition of 10.5 ± 3.5 wt % S and 1.5 ± 1.5 wt % O is compatible with wave speeds and densities throughout the outer core.
https://openalex.org/W1968629692,"Extinction may alter competitive interactions among surviving species, affecting their subsequent recovery and evolution, but these processes remain poorly understood. Analysis of predation traces produced by shell-drilling muricid snails on bivalve prey reveals that species interactions were substantially different before and after a Plio-Pleistocene mass extinction in the western Atlantic. Muricids edge- and wall-drilled their prey in the Pliocene, but Pleistocene and Recent snails attacked prey only through the shell wall. Experiments with living animals suggest that intense competition induces muricid snails to attack shell edges. Pliocene predators, therefore, probably competed for resources more intensely than their post-extinction counterparts."

Occurrence in animals from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans over 111 years made a pathophysiological diagnosis of dysbarism most likely.

Proteins with the capacity to retain the receptor in the cytoplasm are dissociated and AR nuclear localization signals become exposed allowing for nuclear entry and transcription activation (20Green S. Chambon P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Nuclear hormone receptors are divided in two families, in regard to the DNA sequences they recognize. Estrogen, thyroid, and retinoid acid receptors recognize estrogen response element-like (AGGTCA) sequences, whereas androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors recognize GRE-like (AGAACA) sequences (21Laudet V.

To date, there are no known direct AR DNA targets that drive myogenic specified genes (6Sheffield-Moore M. Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). AR, as well as other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is modulated by coregulatory proteins (24McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

Steroid receptors have been shown to interact with other DNA-binding proteins, resulting in modulation of steroid receptor transcriptional activity. AR has been found to interact with a number of transcription factors including AP-1 (25Sato N. Sadar M.D. Bruchovsky N. Saatcioglu F. Rennie P.S. Sato S. Lange P.H. Gleave M.E. J. Biol.

SRF shares a highly conserved DNA-binding/dimerization domain of 90 amino acids, termed the MADS box. SRF serves as a versatile protein that binds to its cognate sites in a multitude of promoters to integrate intracellular signals and assists as a docking surface for the binding of accessory factors that may confer the regulation of specific gene programs (32Belaguli N.S.

Res. 2000; 86: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SRF is a key regulator of immediate early gene expression, which frequently results in mitogenesis, and also of myogenic terminal differentiation. Many muscle-specific genes, including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle α-actins contain combinations of at least three or more strong and weak affinity serum response elements (SRE) that bind SRF in a highly cooperative manner (37Mack C.P. Thompson M.M. Lawrenz-Smith S. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38Chang P.S. Li L. McAnally J. Olson E.N. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accessory factors may then play essential roles in either facilitating or impeding SRF binding on multi-SRE muscle gene promoters; thus, stimulating or repressing transcription of SRF-dependent gene targets. Recently, Kim et al. (40Kim S.W. Kim H.J. Jung D.J. Lee S.K. Kim Y.S. Kim J.H. Kim T.S. Lee J.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6638-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that the steroid receptors, RXR and/or RAR, physically associated with SRF and repressed SRF-dependent c-fos transcriptional activity. We asked if AR played a similar role in myogenesis, and whether it also functioned as an SRF co-factor. Herein, AR activated the skeletal α-actin promoter, which lacks GRE sites, in co-transfected C2C12 cells and provided androgen regulation over the αSk-actin promoter. AR was observed to associate with SRF and together were recruited to SRF DNA binding elements (SRE). Thus, AR was capable of activating a myogenic gene devoid of consensus AR binding sites via its recruitment by SRF. AR also induced precocious muscle differentiation in culture and acted as a potent activator of myogenic gene activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—C2C12 mouse myoblasts were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collections. Myoblasts were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 20% neonatal calf serum. CV1 green monkey kidney fibroblasts were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collections and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.DNA Plasmids—Expression vectors for hAR (human androgen receptor) mutants have been described previously (17Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroohoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Vector encoding hAR (human AR) wild type was used via PCR to subclone hAR into pCGN vector (41Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) for mammalian expression and into Bluescript (Stratagene) for transcription/translation by reticulocyte lysates. The construction of pCGN-hAR used primers: 5′ primer, 5′-GGACCTTCTAGAGAAGTGCAGTTAGGGCTGGGA-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-GCGTGTGGATCCTCACTGGGTGTGGAAATAGATGG-3′.Human androgen receptor from plasmid pAR0 (17Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroohoven C. van der Kwast T.H.

The PCR product was agarose gel-purified, digested with XbaI and BamHI, and ligated to PCGN vector that had been digested with the same enzymes. Construction of Bluescript-hAR used the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-GGACCTTCTAGAATGAGTGCAGTTAGGGCTGGGA-3′ and the 3′ primer, 5′-GCGTGTGGATCCTTTATTTCACTGGGTGTGGAAATAGATGG-3′.Oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify hAR from pAR0 and ligate to plasmid pBluescript KS(+), after digestions with BamHI and XbaI. hAR LBD (ligand binding domain) from pcDNA3 was cut with HindIII and XbaI, and ligated into pP(A)LiS(MS-2) that was cut with those two enzymes. This gave rise to pP(A)LiSK-hAR-LBD, which we used for Sp6-driven AR LBD transcription. SRF mutants cloned in the vector pCGN have been described elsewhere (42Belaguli N.S. Zhou W. Trinh T.H. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pCGN-SRF wild type and pm1 were a kind gift from Ron Prywes. pGEX plasmids encoding fusions of hAR truncations with glutathione S-transferase (GST) have been described elsewhere (43Sun Z. Pan J. Balk S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmid MMTV-Luc was a kind gift from Dr. Ben Peeters (44Alen P. Classens F. Schoenmakers E. Swinnen J.V. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Plasmid with the sequence –398 to +25 of the avian skeletal α-actin promoter cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene is described elsewhere (45MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of Skeletal α-Actin Expression—C2C12 myoblasts were plated on 100-mm plates at a density of 106 cells/well. Myoblasts were first cultured in growth medium, which was switched after 24 h to differentiation medium. Myogenic cells were either treated with 50 nm of the synthetic androgen R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)/ml of culture medium or control dilutant. After the indicated times, cells were harvested in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and assayed by standard RNA blotting using a probe specific for the 3′-untranslated region of the skeletal α-actin gene (46Gunning P. Ponte P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using previously described conditions (47Virca G.D. Northemann W. Shiels B.R. Widera G. Broome S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 370-371PubMed Google Scholar). The probe mouse α-skeletal 3′-untranslated region (196 bp) (48Leader D.P. Gall I. Campbell P. Frischauf A.M. DNA (N. Y.). 1986; 5: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was cut with EcoRI and HindIII, gel purified, and labeled with 10 ng of the “Ready to go” kit (Amersham Biosciences) and [32P]dCTP from ICN.Transfection Assays—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 35,000 cells per well and left overnight. The next day, transfections were carried out with 2.5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression vectors were used at 0.4 μg/well; reporter used at 0.2 μg/well. Cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer (Promega) 48 h after transfection, and assayed using luciferase substrate as described previously (45MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For stable transfection, we used human androgen receptor cDNA, subcloned in the cytopmegalovirus-driven vector pCGN (41Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), which confers a hemagglutinin tag to express AR in stably transfected C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1A). For this purpose, we transfected C2C12 cells with either pCGN vector containing the hAR cDNA insert, or pCGN vector devoid of insert. We included a 20-fold lesser amount of vector pCMV-Neo, which encodes for the selectable trait of geneticin (“G418”) resistance. After at least 2 weeks in selective medium, we pooled and expanded the surviving cells. C2C12 myoblasts plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish in growth medium were co-transfected with 20 μg of pCGN or pCGN-hAR and 1 μg of pCMVneo selection plasmid in a DNA/Lipofectamine mixture. After overnight incubation, myoblasts were allowed to recover, split 1:20 with fresh growth media, and then challenged in selection media (400 μg/ml G418 from Invitrogen). Cells were selected ∼10–14 days following the addition of selection media, and were evaluated by harvesting in SDS sample buffer and analysis by Western blot as follows: 3 × 105 C2C12 myoblasts stably transfected either with pCGN or with pCGN-hAR, growing on 60-mm plates, were taken up in SDS sample buffer. Aliquots were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Other aliquots loaded on SDS-PAGE were visualized with Coomassie stain to see comparative protein loads. The membrane was assayed by immunoblotting for the hemagglutinin-tagged hAR, using anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5 Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions at the dilution 1:100, and secondary anti-mouse antibody from Bio-Rad (catalog number 170-6516).For cell differentiation assay, C2C12 myoblasts were plated on six-well plates at a density of 105 cells/well. After 24 h cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to charcoal-stripped Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 2% horse serum. After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, cells were viewed by an Olympus IMT 2-F microscope and photographed using an Olympus OM88 camera.GST Fusions of AR or SRF—These fusions were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene), and bacteria were broken by sonication. After pelleting debris, aliquots of the supernatants were taken to isolate GST fusions using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 washes, supernatant aliquots were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel, and visualized by Coomassie staining. The remainder were used in binding assays, by incubating with 20 μl of reticulocyte-translated 35S-labeled SRF. After five washes with phosphate-buffered saline, pellets were taken up in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE via autoradiography to detect 35S-labeled SRF or AR. GST-fused protein loading was analyzed by Coomassie stain, whereas labeled proteins were visualized by loading 10% of input. In vitro transcription-translation of proteins was carried out with TnT (Promega), using the manufacturers' instructions.Coimmunoprecipitations—For coimmunoprecipitation, C2C12 myoblasts stably transfected with hAR were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C, and the C2C12 soluble lysate was mixed with non-immune sera or polyclonal rabbit IgG anti-hAR specific for the C-terminal AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or 2 μg of normal rabbit serum IgG bound to 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions.DNA Affinity Precipitations—These precipitations were carried out as described by Chen and Schwartz (33Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using 25 μl of reticulocyte-translated protein for each reactant. SRF binding sites used their complementary oligonucleotides, after boiling and overnight return to room temperature, to form double strands: SRE3, biotin-5′-GGACGCTCCTTATACGGCCCGG-3′; and SREmt, biotin-5′-GGACGCTaaTTATACGGCCCGG-3′.RESULTSIncreased Expression of the Human Androgen Receptor in C2C12 Myoblasts Enhanced Terminal Myogenic Differentiation—Human androgen receptor, a member of the family of steroid binding nuclear receptors (16Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar), has DBD (DNA binding domain) and ligand binding domains identical to those of mouse and rat (49Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal domain and hinge region are also highly conserved. We asked if stably transfected pCGN-hAR would affect differentiation of cultured murine C2C12 myoblasts. hAR myoblasts formed myotubes precociously and to an overwhelming extent when compared with myoblasts transfected with the empty pCGN vector (Fig. 1A). In particular, as shown in Fig. 1A, after 48 h hAR-transfected cell clones had already started to convert to multinucleated myotubes, whereas vector-only cells were just initiating differentiation.Skeletal α-actin (αSk) is a major component of differentiated striated muscle (46Gunning P. Ponte P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Schwartz R.J. Rothblum K. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2506-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in the adult vertebrate and appears post-replication and after fusion in terminally differentiated myogenic cultures. In growth media, C2C12 stable hAR transfectants barely induced the appearance of αSk mRNA over control myoblasts. However, following a switch to differentiation media, we observed a robust appearance of αSk transcripts and myoblast fusion in hAR-transfected C2C12 cells, independent of exogenous androgen ligand, R1881. We have observed that αSK appeared ∼96 h post-platting of myogenic cultures (51Hayward L.J. Schwartz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1485-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), as observed in Fig. 1B. Thus, addition of hAR caused precocious induction of a terminal differentiation marker, αSk, within 48 h of plating myoblasts stably transfected with hAR, in contrast to control myoblasts containing empty vector (Fig. 1B). These results revealed a profound role for AR in early myogenesis and indicated that αSk is an AR gene target. Fig. 1C shows a 10% PAGE and anti-SRF blot of soluble extracts taken from the stable transfected C2C12 cultures; indicating association of SRF with hAR protein, as SRF expression is induced by the transfer of myoblasts in differentiation medium.Skeletal Actin Gene Promoter Is Activated by AR in an SRF-dependent Fashion—We determined that there were no consensus DNA recognition sites for AR on the αSk-actin promoter (–398 to +25 nucleotides; described in Ref. 45MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), employing the program TFSEARCH 2TFSEARCH: Searching Transcription Factor Binding Sites, rwcp.or.jp/papia. set at reduced default settings to a score of 70 (52Heinemeyer T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Because other closely related members of the steroid family were shown to interact with SRF, we asked if AR might also require cofactors such as SRF to transactivate the αSK-actin promoter. In proliferating C2C12 cells (low in SRF, Ref. 39Lee T.C. Chow K.L. Fang P. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neither expression of SRF or AR alone appreciably increased reporter activity. The presence of the synthetic androgen, R1881, and SRF increased luciferase activity by 7.5-fold (Fig. 2A), when compared with pCGN. However, transient co-transfection experiments with hAR and SRF expression vectors with the αSk-actin promoter luciferase reporter gene revealed synergistic co-activation of AR with SRF in prefusion C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2A) by increasing promoter activity by 22-fold. The addition of R1881 to SRF and AR cotransfected myoblasts stimulated αSk-actin promoter transcription up to 98-fold over pCGN levels, thus, showing dependence for full activation on the addition of exogenous androgens.Fig. 2Synergy shared between AR and SRF strongly stimulated a skeletal-actin promoter activity and was dependent upon androgen. Panel A, C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected with the Luciferase gene under the control of the α-skeletal actin promoter (with/without SRE) and the indicated expression vectors. Cells were brought to charcoal-stripped 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM, and assayed after 48 h. Under those conditions, cotransfection of SRF and AR confers androgen inducibility (filled column, +R1881; white, R1881) to the skeletal actin promoter. This experiment was repeated with two different batches of cells, each time in triplicate. Panel B, AR required full-length SRF to increase skeletal actin promoter activity. SRF mutants capable of sustaining promoter activity were, nevertheless, unable to cooperate with AR. CV1 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with the Luciferase gene under the control of the skeletal actin promoter, and the indicated expression vectors. Cells were brought to charcoal-stripped 2% horse serum, 7.5 μg/ml insulin, DMEM (differentiation medium) for 48 h, and assayed for luciferase activity. SRF abbreviations: Wt, wild type, 1–266 (contains N terminus and MADS box); ΔMADS, lacks MADS box; ΔN, lacks N terminus; pm, point mutations on DNA binding domain; Δ5, lacks the part of transactivation domain that is encoded by the fifth exon.

Zhou W. Trinh T.H. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We made several truncated SRF proteins to define the domains of SRF that may be required for co-activation with AR. We used cells devoid of appreciable SRF (42Belaguli N.S. Zhou W. Trinh T.H. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or AR (19Kemppainen J.A. Lane M.V. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 968-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) expression: co-activation of promoter activity was observed in co-transfected CV1 fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). Only full-length SRF was able to cooperate with AR in activation of the αSk-actin promoter. All mutants of SRF had in the presence of AR lower transactivation potential than alone. Absence of SRE and thereby DNA-bound SRF abrogates induction of the promoter.Recruitment of Androgen Receptor by SRF on Intact SRE— We next investigated whether SRF could selectively recruit AR protein in the cellular lysate containing SRF binding sites. The SRE3, a site essential for full activity of the skeletal actin promoter, located between –186 to –167 bp (55Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was biotinylated and precipitated using avidin-coated magnetic beads. The bound material was eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We show that AR is specifically recruited by SRE3 only in the presence of SRF (Fig. 3). This demonstrates the possibility of a physical association of hAR with DNA-bound SRF. Our results indicate that SRF and AR are able to establish protein"
https://openalex.org/W2128058777,Three recent papers reveal a fascinating link between pol II termination and ribonucleolytic decay of the nascent transcript by a 5′-3′ exonuclease (yeast Rat1 and human Xrn2). The exonuclease travels with pol II and gains access to the nascent RNA after endonucleolytic cleavage at the poly(A) site or at a second cotranscriptional cleavage site (CoTC). It is then thought to track in a 5′-3′ direction like a guided torpedo that ultimately helps dissociate the RNA polymerase elongation complex.
https://openalex.org/W2035914733,"Viral and bacterial pathogens have long been suspected to affect atherogenesis directly. However, mechanisms linking innate immunity to chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis are still poorly defined. Here we show that infection of primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAOSMC) with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) leads to activation of the novel IkappaB kinase (IKK)-related kinase, Tank-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), a major effector of the cellular innate immune response. We demonstrate that part of the HCMV inflammatory response is most likely mediated via this novel kinase because the canonical IKK complex was only poorly activated upon infection of HAOSMC. An increase in TBK1 phosphotransferase activity led to a strong activation of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 transcription factor as measured by its C-terminal phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA binding activity. In addition to TBK1, HAOSMC also express another IKK-related kinase isoform, IKKepsilon, albeit at a lower level. Nevertheless, both isoforms were required for full activation of IRF-3 by HCMV. The transcripts of proatherosclerotic genes Ccl5 (encoding for the chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted)) and Cxcl10 (encoding for the chemokine IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10)) were induced in an IRF-3-dependent manner after HCMV infection of smooth muscle cells. In addition, cytokine arrays analysis showed that RANTES and IP-10 were the predominant chemokines present in the supernatant of HCMV-infected HAOSMC. Activation of the TBK1/IRF-3 pathway was independent of epidermal growth factor receptor and pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor activation. Our results thus add additional molecular clues to a possible role of HCMV as a modulator of atherogenesis through the induction of a proinflammatory response that is, in part, dependent of an IKK-related kinase pathway."

The imported tRNA undergoes efficient aminoacylation within the organelle and supports organellar protein synthesis. Moreover, translation in mitochondria from patients with myclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) and Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), containing mutant tRNALys genes, is stimulated to near-wild-type levels and the formation of aberrant polypeptides suppressed by complex-mediated import.

These results suggest a novel way to introduce RNAs for the modulation of mitochondrial gene expression. The mitochondrial genomes of a wide variety of protist, plant, and animal species contain an insufficient number of functional tRNA genes, and translation of mitochondrial mRNAs is sustained by import of nucleus-encoded tRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 1Schneider A. Marechal-Drouard L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 509-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although human mitochondria do not normally import tRNA, a number of neuromuscular degenerative diseases are caused by mutations in mitochondrial tRNA genes (2Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). For example, the genetic disease known as myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) 1The abbreviations used are: MERRF, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; KSS, Kearns-Sayre syndrome; RIC, RNA import complex; CCCP, m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazine; ND, NADH dehydrogenase, CO, cytochrome oxidase; A, F1F0 ATPase. is caused by the A8344G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALys gene (3Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Lezza A.M. Seibel P. Ballinger S.W. Wallace D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 931-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Other diseases such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) are characterized by mitochondrial genomic deletions (4Mita S. Rizzuto R. Moraes C.T. Shanske S. Arnaudo E. Fabrizi G.M. Koga Y. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Correction of the tRNA defect may be possible by engineering the import machinery derived from other species into human cells. Crude extracts from yeast support the import of a yeast tRNA into human mitochondria (5Kolesnikova O.A. Entelis N.S. Mireau H. Fox T.D. Martin R.P. Tarassov I.A. Science. 2000; 289: 1931-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and transfection of modified yeast tRNA genes into cybrid cells rescues translation in, and activity of, MERRF-derived mitochondria (6Kolesnikova O.A. Entelis N.S. Jaquin-Becker C. Goltzene F. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Lightowlers R.N. Martin R.P. Tarassov I.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2519-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but the effect is only partial, and there is considerable clonal heterogeneity. An alternative approach is suggested by the observation that certain yeast and human tRNAs, including human tRNA1Lys are imported into the mitochondria of the kinetoplastid protozoa Trypanosoma (7Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Leishmania (8Goswami S. Chatterjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Basu S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating a broad specificity of the endogenous tRNA import machinery in these organisms, which import a wide variety of tRNAs to support mitochondrial translation in the complete absence of organellar tRNA genes (9Simpson A.M. Suyama Y. Dewes H. Campbell D. Simpson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5427-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19203-19215Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In Leishmania, short sequence motifs in various tRNA domains are recognized as import signals (11Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A previously characterized motif YGGUAGAGC is present in a number of kinetoplastid tRNAs, including Leishmania tRNATyr(GUA), where it acts as an import signal (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Mukherjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7410-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An identical sequence is present in the D domain of human tRNA1Lys (Fig. 1), explaining its recognition by the Leishmania import apparatus. Recently, we have isolated a large protein complex (the RNA import complex or RIC) with an apparent molecular mass of ∼640 kDa from the inner membrane of Leishmania mitochondria that induces the import of Leishmania tRNATyr into phospholipid vesicles (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This complex resolves into multiple protein species, including two, of apparent mass 45 and 21 kDa, respectively, that bind to different tRNAs (tRNATyr and tRNAIle) in an allosterically regulated manner (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether RIC is capable of delivering tRNAs into the matrix of human mitochondria. Cell Culture and Preparation of Mitochondria—The hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The following homoplasmic transmitochondrial cybrids were derived by fusing mitochondria-less 143B206 cells with enucleated patient fibroblasts containing wild-type or mutant mitochondria and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg/liter uridine: LB58, containing wild-type mitochondria (14Masucci J.P. Davidson M. Koga Y. Schon E. King M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); LB64, containing MERRF mitochondria with the A8344G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALys gene (14Masucci J.P. Davidson M. Koga Y. Schon E. King M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); and FLP32.39, derived from a patient with the Kearns-Sayre syndrome, harboring a 1902-bp mitochondrial DNA deletion between nucleotides 7846 and 9748 (15Sobreira C. King K.P. Davidson M.M. Park H. Koga Y. Miranda A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 266: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from cell lysates by differential centrifugation as described (16Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare mitoplasts, the outer membrane was selectively removed with 320 μm digitonin (17Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purification of RIC—Sodium deoxycholate extracts of Leishmania tropica mitochondrial inner membranes were subjected to RNA affinity chromatography and the 1 m Na+ eluate concentrated to yield RIC, as described (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Import Substrates—Leishmania tRNATyr(GUA) and tRNAGln(CUG) and 3′-CCA terminated human cytoplasmic tRNA1Lys(UUU) were prepared by T7 RNA polymerase transcription of cloned or PCR-amplified templates as described (8Goswami S. Chatterjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Basu S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Lysylation of 32P-labeled tRNALys transcript was carried out as described (16Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a 0–80% ammonium sulfate concentrated HepG2 cytosolic extract as the enzyme source. Import Assay—Import into intact mitochondria or mitoplasts was assayed by RNase protection as described previously (17Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitoplasts (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 32P-labeled RNA (2.5 nm) in the presence of 4 mm ATP and ∼0.2 μg of affinity-purified RIC at 37 °C for 15 min, then treated with RNases A plus T1, washed, and the RNase-resistant mitochondrial RNA recovered for gel electrophoretic analysis. Intact mitochondria were preincubated for 1 h on ice before the import incubation. Aminoacylated tRNAs were analyzed on 7 m urea, 8% PAGE in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 4 °C and 7 V/cm, with buffer recirculation (19Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Organello Translation—Unless otherwise stated, mitoplasts or mitochondria (100 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in 20 μl of translation mixture (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMgSO4, 12 mm creatine phosphate, 0.16 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 4mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm NADH, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.125 mm concentration each unlabeled amino acid except methionine, 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), 100 fmol of lysyl-tRNALys, and 280 ng of RIC. After washing the mitoplasts with sucrose-Tris-EDTA buffer, [35S]methionine incorporation into protein was measured as hot trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts/min (20Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Translation products were analyzed by 15–20% exponential gradient SDS-PAGE (21Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by fluorography. Mitoplasts prepared from the human cell line HepG2 were incubated with Leishmania tRNATyr and tested for import by RNase protection. ATP- and RIC-dependent import was observed (Fig. 1A). Import was tRNA-specific, since Leishmania tRNAGln(CUG), which is not recognized by RIC (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was not imported (Fig. 1A). Moreover, import was sensitive to a range of respiratory inhibitors (Fig. 1A), including m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazine (CCCP, a protonophore), valinomycin (a K+ ionophore), nigericin (a K+/H+ exchanger), and oligomycin (an inhibitor of F1F0 ATPase). CCCP disrupts transmembrane proton gradients, thus reducing the protonmotive force that drives synthesis of ATP as well as various transport processes across the inner mitochondrial membrane; valinomycin neutralizes the electrical component of this gradient, while nigericin equalizes the proton concentration across the membrane without affecting the membrane potential; and oligomycin blocks proton flow-through the F1F0 ATPase. Similar sensitivities have been observed in the reconstituted phospholipid vesicle system and reflect the intrinsic property of RIC as a proton pump capable of generating a membrane potential at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, as observed recently (22Bhattacharyya S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Apparently, hydrolysis of ATP generates a pH gradient that actually drives import (22Bhattacharyya S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Significantly, human cytoplasmic tRNALys was transferred to the matrix of HepG2 mitoplasts in an RIC- and ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 1C), thus opening up the possibility of modulating mitochondrial translation. The RNA import complex was isolated from the inner membrane and appears to work quite well when simply added to phospholipid vesicles (13Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or to human mitoplasts (Fig. 1) or to RIC-depleted Leishmania mitoplasts (data not shown). For successful tRNA delivery, however, it is essential to reconstitute intact mitochondria, i.e. organelles with an intact outer membrane. When RIC was simply added to intact HepG2 mitochondria and import incubations carried out without a preincubation step, little or no uptake of human cytoplasmic tRNALys was observed (Fig. 1D). However, upon preincubation of intact mitochondria with RIC for 60 min on ice, uptake was greatly stimulated (Fig. 1D). A HepG2 cytosolic extract could not substitute for the preincubation (data not shown), and addition of the extract to preincubated mitochondria did not have any effect (Fig. 1D), indicating the lack of a requirement for cytosolic factors. The requirement of a preincubation step could be due to some intrinsic feature of the composition or structure of the outer membrane, such as the presence of sterols, resulting in a slower rate of RIC insertion into the membrane. To determine the intramitochondrial location of the tRNALys after transfer through the outer membrane of preincubated HepG2 mitochondria, postimport, RNase-treated mitochondria were fractionated into outer membrane plus intermembrane space and mitoplasts by treatment with digitonin, which selectively solubilizes the outer membrane (17Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and labeled tRNA recovered from each fraction. At the concentration of digitonin used (320 μm), about 95% of the outer membrane marker kynurenine hydroxylase, but less than 1% of the inner membrane marker succinate deydrogenase was solubilized, as observed previously (17Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), attesting to the specificity of the solubilization procedure. About 40% of the internalized tRNA (i.e. resistant to RNase treatment of the intact mitochondrion) was recovered from the mitoplasts (Fig. 1D, lane 9) and the remainder from the outer membrane-intermembrane space fraction (Fig. 1D, lane 8). About 15% of the internalized tRNA was resistant to RNase treatment of the recovered mitoplasts (Fig. 1D, lane 10); this represents the tRNA in the matrix; the remainder is presumably stuck to the outer surface of the inner membrane and therefore RNase-sensitive. Next, we checked the ability of RIC to introduce cytoplasmic tRNALys into mitochondria containing mutations in the organellar tRNALys gene and thus complement the translational defects arising from such mutations. For this purpose, mitochondria were prepared from cybrid cell lines derived from human patients with mitochondrially inherited genetic disorders. Cybrid LB58 contains wild-type mitochondria (14Masucci J.P. Davidson M. Koga Y. Schon E. King M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cybrid LB64 is nearly homoplasmic for mitochondria derived from a MERRF patient, which contain a single A-to-G transition in the mitochondrial tRNALys gene (14Masucci J.P. Davidson M. Koga Y. Schon E. King M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cybrid FLP32.39 is similarly derived from a patient with the Kearns-Sayre syndrome and is characterized by a 1.9-kb mitochondrial deletion covering the tRNALys gene, as well as the COII, COIII, A6, and A8 genes (15Sobreira C. King K.P. Davidson M.M. Park H. Koga Y. Miranda A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 266: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RIC-induced import of cytoplasmic tRNALys into LB64 and FLP32.39 mitoplasts (Fig. 1E) as well as preincubated intact mitochondria (Fig. 1F) was observed. We next determined the effect of aminoacylation of the cytoplasmic tRNALys on RIC-mediated import into human mitochondria. Indirect evidence indicates that aminoacylation is not a requirement for import in kinetoplastid protozoa (23Schneider A. Martin J. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but appears to be necessary in yeast (24Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and plants (25Delage L. Duchene A.M. Zaepfel M. Marechal-Drouard L. Plant J. 2003; 34: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The CCA-terminated tRNA1Lys transcript (Fig. 1) was lysylated in vitro with an enzyme preparation from HepG2 cytosol, and the charged and uncharged forms were resolved by electrophoresis under acidic conditions (19Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly complete charging of the transcript with lysine occurred, with the amino acid-RNA linkage characteristically labile to heat at alkaline pH (Fig. 2A). RIC-dependent import of both the charged and uncharged species into HepG2 mitoplasts was observed, with about the same efficiency (Fig. 2B). This experiment simultaneously shows that import itself does not cause appreciable deacylation of the tRNA (but see later). Isoaccepting mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNAs may have considerable structural differences, and it is by no means certain that an imported cytosolic species would be recognized by the prokaryotic-type organellar ribosome or by the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. To test the ability of imported cytosolic tRNALys to support mitochondrial translation, HepG2 mitoplasts were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide (to block residual cytoplasmic translation) under lysinelimiting conditions with RIC, ATP, and lysyl-tRNALys; RIC-mediated delivery of the charged tRNA should then rescue organellar protein synthesis. The mitoplasts used were of greater than 95% purity, as shown by marker assays (see above), and by the lack of significant cycloheximide-sensitive amino acid incorporation due to the near-complete solubilization of the outer membrane and any associated cytoplasmic polysomes by digitonin treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A, left panel, in the presence of RIC, lysyl-tRNALys, but not the uncharged species, could partially replace lysine for chloramphenicol-sensitive protein synthesis in lysine-deficient mitoplasts. Lysyl-tRNA-dependent translation was competed out by excess Leishmania tRNATyr, indicating the involvement of the RIC tRNA import pathway, whereas lysine-dependent translation, presumably involving an inner membrane amino acid carrier, was not (Fig. 3A, right panel). There was no detectable deacylation of lysyl-tRNALys imported alone in the presence of RIC (Fig. 2B). However, in the presence of a lysine-deficient amino acid mixture, the imported tRNALys underwent deacylation, and deacylation was inhibited by chloramphenicol (Fig. 2C), indicating the direct transfer of lysine from the imported tRNA to the elongating polypeptide chains. These results argue against the possibility that free lysine, generated by deacylation of the cytoplasmic tRNA before or during import, was responsible for the observed effects. Additionally, about 75% of tRNALys underwent acylation within the mitochondrion in the presence of lysine (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4), and imported lysyl-tRNALys, which underwent deacylation in the presence of a lysine-deficient translation mixture (Fig. 2D, lane 5), became reacylated on addition of lysine added simultaneously (Fig. 2D, lane 6) or subsequently (Fig. 2D, lane 7). Thus, the cytoplasmic tRNALys is recognized by the mitochondrial lysyl-tRNA synthetase, as observed previously (26Tolkunova E. Park H. Xia J. King M.P. Davidson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35063-35069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and undergoes multiple rounds of decylation and reacylation during translation within the organelle. The mutant mitochondria exhibited qualitative as well as quantitative defects of translation. In in organello translation assays, a variable degree of inhibition of individual translation products was observed with LB64 mitochondria, ranging from 4.5% of the wild-type level for ND5 to 56.7% for ND3 (Fig. 3B, lane 3); the overall decline in translation rate was about 75%. Moreover, aberrant translation products of 47 and 34 kDa were present. These results are consistent with those obtained with intact cells (14Masucci J.P. Davidson M. Koga Y. Schon E. King M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), except that the two smallest aberrant products observed in that study were not clearly apparent. FLP32.39 mitochondria were completely defective for synthesis of all polypeptides except for ND4L, which was reduced to 22% of the wild-type level (Fig. 3B, lane 5). In the presence of RIC and cytoplasmic lysyl-tRNALys, the translation of individual polypeptides was significantly stimulated to 35–100% of wild-type levels in both of the mutants (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 6). Under these conditions, the aberrant products of LB64 mitochondria disappeared. In RIC-treated FLP32.39 mitochondria, COII, COIII, A6, ΔA6, and A8 were missing due to deletion of the corresponding genes, but unexpectedly, ND1 was also absent, being replaced by a slightly larger polypeptide (Fig. 3B, lane 6). The reason for this is unknown; it may be due to translational read-through caused by a previously undetected frameshifting mutation in the ND1 gene. The A8344G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALys gene of MERRF patients causes severe translational defects through inefficient aminoacylation of the mutant tRNA (27Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and/or ineffective codon recognition (28Kirino Y. Yasukawa T. Ohta S. Akira S. Ishihara K. Watanabe K. Suzuki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15070-15075Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The system of translational correction described above exploits the broad specificity of the protozoal RNA import complex to introduce a human cytosolic tRNA into human mitochondria. The imported tRNA is highly efficient in translational rescue; the small fraction of the tRNA transferred to the matrix (Fig. 1) suffices to restore translation to nearly wild-type levels, as well as to suppress aberrant polypeptide formation (Fig. 3). This may be due to the high level of aminoacylation of the imported tRNA within the organelle and direct transfer of the lysine to the translating ribosome (Fig. 2). In contrast, yeast tRNA derivatives are aminoacylated with variable efficiency within human mitochondria, and this, together with variable expression levels, may account for the observed clonal heterogeneity (6Kolesnikova O.A. Entelis N.S. Jaquin-Becker C. Goltzene F. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Lightowlers R.N. Martin R.P. Tarassov I.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2519-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Traditionally, it has been difficult to introduce exogenous nucleic acids into mitochondria. The RIC is a molecular machine that easily inserts into membranes in a defined orientation (22Bhattacharyya S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11259-11263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and is active through double membranes, enabling transfer into the matrix of intact mitochondria (Fig. 1). The issue of membrane permeability of this large complex is interesting and needs further mechanistic studies. We thank Michael P. King for providing the cybrid cell lines."

The conversion of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl 5′-monophosphate (AICAR) 1The abbreviations used are: AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl 5′-monophosphate; IMP, inosine 5′-monophosphate; FAICAR, 5-formaminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl 5′-monophosphate; GAR, 5-phosphoribosylglycinamide; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl 5′-monophosphate; IMP, inosine 5′-monophosphate; FAICAR, 5-formaminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl 5′-monophosphate; GAR, 5-phosphoribosylglycinamide; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. to inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP) represents the last steps in the de novo biosynthesis of purines (Fig. 1). In bacteria and eukaryotes, this reaction occurs in two separate steps catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC or PurH), encoded by the purH gene. AICAR transformylase activity resides in the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme, which transfers the formyl group from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to AICAR, resulting in the formation of 5-formaminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl 5′-monophosphate (FAICAR). The product of this first reaction is then cyclized by the IMP cyclohydrolase activity that resides in the amino terminus of the enzyme (1Rayl E.A. Moroson B.A. Beardsley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The two-domain structure of PurH has recently been confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of the avian enzyme (2Greasley S.E. Horton P. Ramcharan J. Beardsley G.P. Benkovic S.J. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Until recently, PurH was assumed to function in Archaea, just as in bacteria and eukaryotes. However, new data have led some investigators to question this assumption in some species of Archaea. These data include the following: the observation that N10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate is not required for this reaction in Archaea (3White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3374-3377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), genomic DNA sequence comparisons that indicate the absence of purH genes in Archaea (4Selkov E. Maltsev N. Olsen G.J. Overbeek R. Whitman W.B. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 11-26Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Koike H. Kawashima T. Suzuki M. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1999; 75: 263-268Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the identification of purO (MJ0626) that encodes a new IMP cyclohydrolase that cyclizes FAICAR to IMP in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (7Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1471-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our attempts to identify the AICAR transformylase gene by searching for genes close to purO in other genomes have not proved fruitful, due in part to the low abundance of purO in the presently sequenced genomes. Attempts at isolation and purification have proved futile. We thus tested recombinant M. jannaschii proteins predicted to catalyze an analogous reaction in order to find the enzyme catalyzing this reaction. This analogous reaction is one catalyzed by ATP-grasp enzymes, several of which are present in the M. jannaschii genome. The 5-phosphoribosylglycinamide (GAR) to 5-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide reaction in purine biosynthesis is conducted by two different routes, each with its own unique enzyme. In one route, catalyzed by GAR transformylase N, N10-formyltetrahydrofolate is the substrate and formyl donor; in the other route, catalyzed by GAR transformylase T, ATP and formate serve as substrates (8Marolewski A. Smith J.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2531-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This latter route, as well as those catalyzed by phosphoribosylaminoglycine ligase (PurD) and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase (PurK), employs members of the ATP-grasp superfamily of enzymes for catalysis (9Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). M. jannaschii contains 12 genes annotated as ATP-grasp enzymes (10Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Grishin N.V. Tatusov R.L. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 608-628PubMed Google Scholar), and based on the comparison with GAR transformylase N and GAR transformylase T, we considered one of them could be the enzyme. We cloned and overexpressed several of these genes and individually tested each for its ability to catalyze the transformylase reaction using ATP and formate as substrates. Only the protein derived from the MJ0136 gene, which we designate as purP, catalyzed the desired reaction. Here we present the data on the characterization of this enzyme and its reaction. Chemicals—Sodium hydrogencarbonate (99% 13C) and sodium salt of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-2,2,3,3-2H4 were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Phosphonoacetaldehyde was a gift from Debra Dunaway-Mariano (University of New Mexico). All other reagents and synthetic precursors were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. PurO was prepared by recombinant methods as described previously (7Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1471-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Formyl Phosphate—Formyl phosphate was prepared by the formylation of K2HPO4 in water with acetic-formic anhydride, as described recently by Gill et al. (11Gill M.S. Neverov A.A. Brown R.S. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 7351-7357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and based on a earlier method by Stadtman (12Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 228-231Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The method is simpler than that using formyl fluoride (13Smithers G.W. Jahansouz H. Kofron J.L. Himes R.H. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3943-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Acetic-formic anhydride was formed by heating a mixture of 0.2 ml of 100% formate and 0.4 ml of acetic anhydride at 50 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 0 °C, the reaction product was added into 3.0 ml of 2.3 m K2HPO4 with stirring. After 30 min of stirring at 0 °C, colorless crystals formed. Acetone (3 ml) was added, and the crystals were separated by filtration and washed three times with 3-ml portions of acetone, dried under vacuum, and stored in the freezer at –20 °C in sealed tubes. The 1H NMR spectrum of the isolated product in D2O, 1h after solution in D2O at room temperature, showed a doublet (δ 8.4, JH→P = 3.4 Hz) from the formyl phosphate and a singlet (δ 8.14) from the formate. The area of formyl phosphate signal was 5.8% of the area of formate resonance signal. These resonances are the same as those reported earlier for formyl phosphate synthesized using formyl fluoride (13Smithers G.W. Jahansouz H. Kofron J.L. Himes R.H. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3943-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Formyl phosphate in the isolated product was assayed by its conversion into formyl hydroxamic acid, quantitated by formation of its ferric complex (12Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 228-231Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This analysis showed, based on dry weight, that only 4–5% of the isolated product was the potassium salt of formyl phosphate. The formyl phosphate concentrations used in the incubations were calculated based on this latter measurement. Cloning and Expression of M. jannaschii MJ0136 —The M. jannaschii gene at loci MJ0136 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q57600) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers (Invitrogen). The primers used were MJ0136-Fwd (5′-GGTGGTCATATGATTTCAAAAGATGAG-3′) and MJ0136-Rev (5′-GATCGGATCCTTATGAAATAATCTTATC-3′). PCR amplification was performed as described previously (14Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3688-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using a 50 °C annealing temperature. The PCR product was purified by using a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and then ligated into plasmid pET17b to make the recombinant plasmid pMJ0136. DNA sequence was verified by dye terminator sequencing at Davis Sequencing, Inc. (Davis, CA). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-PIL (Stratagene), and heterologous expression of the MJ0136 protein was performed by standard methods that included induction with lactose (14Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3688-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 5 min) and frozen at –20 °C. Purification of the Recombinant MJ0136 Protein from E. coli—Induction of the desired protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (12% T, 4% C acrylamide, using a Tris/glycine buffer system) analysis of total cellular proteins. The desired protein was recovered from transformed E. coli cells by sonication in the assay buffer plus dithiothreitol (0.2 m TES/K+, 10 mm Mg2, and 20 mm dithiothreitol) and purified by heat treatment as described previously (15Li H. Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9771-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The optimum temperature/heating time used in the purification was established to be 70 °C for 10 min. The enzyme was purified further by chromatography on MonoQ as described previously (15Li H. Graupner M. Xu H. White R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9771-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It eluted at a NaCl concentration of ∼0.5 m. SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining showed the enzyme was essentially pure. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Measurement of the Native Molecular Weight of PurP—Size exclusion chromatography was performed at room temperature on a Superose 12HR column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mm HEPES/NaOH and 0.15 m NaCl at pH 7.2. PurP in a volume of 160 μl was applied to the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Protein standards (horse spleen apoferritin, potato β-amylase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, hen egg white, conalbumin, bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, and horse heart cytochrome c) were used to calibrate the column as described previously (16Li H. Xu H. Graham D.E. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11100-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Standard Assay for the Measurement of PurP Enzymatic Activity— The Bratton-Marshall assay was used to measure the loss of AICAR as it was converted to FAICAR in a fixed timed assay (17Flaks J.G. Erwin M.J. Buchanan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 603-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard incubation mixture consisted of 50 μl of assay buffer (0.2 m TES/K+ and 10 mm Mg2+ buffer at pH 7.3) and 5 μl of each of the following solutions: 0.01 m AICAR, 0.1 m ATP, 0.1 m sodium formate, and PurP. Typically 5 μl of a diluted sample of a 2.9 mg/ml stock solution of protein containing 0.58 μg of protein was sufficient to convert ∼50% of the substrate to product in 15 min. The solution was incubated in 0.5-ml disposable centrifuge tubes in a water bath at 70 °C for 15 min and centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 10 s to reconsolidate the small amount of water evaporated from the sample on the sides of the tube during heating. The remaining AICAR was assayed at room temperature by adding 20 μlof the incubated mixture to 400 μl of 0.25 m HCl, followed by the addition of 100 μl of a 0.22 m aqueous solution of sodium nitrite. The solution was thoroughly mixed. After 1 min, 100 μl of 0.66 m aqueous solution of ammonium sulfamate was added, and the solution was mixed. After 2 min, 300 μl of a 0.04 m solution of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride was added to the solution. Color developed completely in less than 1 min and did not change significantly over time. The absorbance of the assayed solution was measured at 540 nm using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. The operational extinction coefficient for AICAR was 2.05 × 104 cm–1 m–1. Acetate and propionate were tested as alternate substrates for the reaction by their substitution for formate at the same concentration as formate. Confirmation of Reaction Products Generated by PurP Incubated with AICAR, Formate, and ATP—UV spectroscopic, high pressure liquid chromatography, and NMR methods were used to establish the amount and nature of the products generated after incubation of PurP with AICAR, formate, and ATP. In the first method, FAICAR was converted into IMP by PurO, and IMP was confirmed by UV spectroscopy. Two samples were prepared in a 350-μl standard incubation assay buffer and contained 0.7 μmol of ATP, 0.35 μmol of formate, and 0.21 μmol of AICAR; one sample also contained PurP (14 μg). Both samples were incubated for 15 min at 70 °C. After this initial incubation, PurO (∼25 μg) was added to both samples, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min at 70 °C. UV difference spectra were used to obtain the spectrum of the product. Chromatography of the sample on MonoQ (19Graupner M. White R.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10859-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) before and after PurO incubation showed FAICAR before incubation and IMP after incubation. The second method recorded the 1H NMR and 31P NMR of the reactants and products before and after the incubation period. For both experiments, 350 μl of standard incubation assay buffer was mixed with 35 μl of 1 m sodium formate, 17.5 μl of 1 m ATP, 105 μl of 1 m AICAR, and 0.1 mg of MonoQ-purified PurP and then incubated at 70 °C in a water bath for 15 min. Under these conditions, ∼80% of the AICAR was converted into product, based on the observed changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products. Increasing the incubation time to 40 min led to no increase in the amount of product generated. 31P NMR analysis of the resulting sample was then used to determine the nature of the phosphorylated products. For the 1H NMR spectra, the water in the sample was removed with a stream of nitrogen gas, and the sample was then dissolved in deuterated water containing the sodium salt of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-2,2,3,3-2H4. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Unity-400 spectrometer, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on an Inova-400 spectrometer. 1H NMR of AICAR showed identifying resonances for the H-2 of the imidazole (singlet δ 7.52) and a doublet for the anomeric hydrogen of the ribose (δ 5.66, JH-1′→H-2′ = 7.2 Hz). Additional resonances (δ 4–4.5) for the other ribose hydrogens were also observed. After incubation of AICAR with PurP, formate, and ATP, the intensity of these identifying resonances for AICAR and formate decreased, and they were replaced by resonances for the formamide resonance of FAICAR (δ 8.41), H-2 of the imidazole (δ 8.21), and a doublet for the anomeric hydrogen of the ribose (δ 5.64, JH-1′→H-2′ = 7.2 Hz). These chemical shifts are the same as Mueller and Benkovic report (18Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), after correction for their use of dioxane as the internal reference. Mueller and Benkovic (18Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) report two resonances for the formamide hydrogen (δ 8.18 and δ 7.98). They conclude this splitting arises from two different conformations of the formamide with respect to the rest of the ribonucleotide and results from restricted rotation of the formamide. To confirm the peak assignment for the formamide resonance, the incubation was repeated, substituting [13C]formate. As expected, the singlet for the formamide (δ 8.41) split into a doublet (J = 207 Hz). We have not established a reasonable explanation for the differences. FAICAR was also prepared as Flaks et al. describe (17Flaks J.G. Erwin M.J. Buchanan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 603-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was purified by MonoQ chromatography. The resulting product gave the same 1H NMR spectrum as the enzymatically produced compound. Testing Formyl Phosphate, Phosphonoacetaldehyde, and Acetyl Phosphate—Samples of formyl phosphate were dissolved in the standard incubation assay buffer and added to the standard assay mixture, without the addition of ATP and formate, at a calculated initial concentration of 1.5 mm. The assay was then performed as described earlier. Phosphonoacetaldehyde, a methylene analog of formyl phosphate, was incubated under the standard assay conditions at concentrations of 0.2, 2, and 20 mm to test whether it inhibited the enzymatic reaction. Acetyl phosphate was tested in the standard assay at a concentration of 14 mm. Temperature Stability of the Enzyme—Samples of PurP (0.58 μg) in 55 μl of assay buffer were incubated at 60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C, 110 °C, and 120 °C for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature. Each sample was then assayed for remaining enzymatic activity using the standard assay. The amount of protein selected for this experiment corresponded to the amount of protein producing a linear assay from the 70 °C heated sample. Nucleotide and Metal Ion Specificity of the Enzyme—The nucleotide specificity of PurP was determined by conducting the standard assay and substituting GTP, ITP, UTP, CTP ADP, pyrophosphate (PPi), and tripolyphosphate (PPPi) for ATP. The effect of different metal ions on the conversion of AICAR to FAICAR was determined by preparing the assay buffer with 10 mm concentrations of the following metal salts: MgCl2, MnCl2, BaCl2, CuCl2, NiCl2, ZnCl2, and ZnSO4. The standard assay was then run with each of the buffers. The amount of PurP was adjusted so that only 50% of the sample was converted into product with MgCl2. pH Optimum—The effect of pH on PurP activity was studied using two different buffer systems, each containing 10 mm MgCl2. In the pH range of 3.5–5.5, a 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer was used; in the pH range of 5.5–9.5, a three-component buffer system containing 75 mm bis-Tris, 38 mm HEPPS, and 38 mm CHES (adjusted to pH 5.5–9.5 using either NaOH or HCl) was used (20Pham D.N. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13725-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Product Inhibition—To test whether the reaction products inhibited the reaction, the standard assay was run with ATP, formate, and AICAR for 15 min, and then additional AICAR was added to bring the concentration back to the initial assay concentration, followed by continued incubation for an additional 15 min. The amount of AICAR lost was established after each incubation. An additional experiment containing the reaction product ADP at the same concentration of ATP and in addition to ATP was also conducted. Measurement of Formate Production from CO2 and H2–To 100 μl of M. jannaschii cell extract (21White R.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7618-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was added 10 μl of 10 mm sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate in anaerobic water and 20 μlof1 m NaH13CO3, pH 7.0, in anaerobic TES buffer (50 mm TES/K+ and 10 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.5), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 70 °C under hydrogen (28 p.s.i.). The 2-bromoethanesulfonate was included in the incubation mixture to inhibit the conversion of formate to methane (22Gunsalus R.P. Romesser J.A. Wolfe R.S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2374-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Hutten T.J. De Jong M.H. Peeters B.P. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 27-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Smith M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 516-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 10 μl of 8 m perchloric acid was added with mixing. The resulting sample was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 10 min), and the yellow extract was removed and brought to pH 6.8 by the addition of 6 m NaOH. To this solution was added 100 μlof0.5 m Na2HPO4 at pH 6.8 and 0.5 ml of 100 mm 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetone. The yellow sample was both shaken and heated at 60 °C for 14 h in a water bath and, after cooling, was extracted with n-hexane (1 ml). The hexane layer was separated and evaporated to 50 μl with a stream of dry nitrogen gas prior to GC-MS analysis. Portions of this procedure were adopted from the previously published method for measuring formate in blood (25Kage S. Kudo K. Ikeda H. Ikeda N. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2004; 805: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis of the samples used a VG-70–70EHF gas chromatography-mass spectrometer operating at 70 eV and equipped with a Varian VF-5MS column (0.32 mm × 30 m) programmed from 60 °C to 260 °C at 4 °C/min. Under these GC-MS conditions, the 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl derivatives of the following compounds had the following retention times (min:s; shown in parentheses) and mass spectral data [molecular weight, base peak, the most abundant ion with mass over 200 m/z, and percentage of base peak; shown in brackets]: (a) chloride, (3:28) [260, 181, 260, 2.8]; (b) bromide, (5:00) [260, 181, 260, 2.8]; (c) formate, (5:08) [226, 181, 226, 35]; (d) acetate, (7:07) [240, 181, 240, 32]; (e) propionate, (9:53) [254, 181, 254, 20]; and (f) acrylate, (10:01) [252, 181, 252, 20]. Quantitation of the formate was based on the ratios of the areas of the separated pentafluorobenzyl formate to pentafluorobenzyl bromide signals obtained by the GC-MS analysis of known samples of formate in the cell extract buffer. Measurement of Formate in the Cells—To establish the amount of natural formate in the M. jannaschii cells, 290 mg (wet weight) of cells (78.3 mg, dry weight) was mixed with 0.6 ml of 1 m HCl, and the sample was heated for 1 min at 100 °C and then centrifuged (14,000 × g, 30 min), and the yellow extract was separated. The resulting pellet was re-extracted two times with water (0.4 ml) following the same procedure. The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness with a stream of nitrogen gas and placed in 0.5 ml of 2H2O, which was then adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOD. The sodium salt of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-2,2,3,3-2H (0.43 μmol) was used as both the chemical shift reference and the internal standard to quantitate the amount of the formate present in the extract. 1H NMR spectrum was obtained on a Unity-400 spectrometer. The measured formate concentration in the 1H NMR sample was 0.34 mm formate in the water. Testing Different ATP-grasp Enzymes—The predicted ATP-grasp enzymes derived from the M. jannaschii genes MJ0136, MJ0776, MJ0815, and MJ0106 were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and tested in the standard assay for their ability to catalyze the formylation of AICAR. Only the MJ0136 protein (PurP) was effective. This enzyme catalyzed the linear loss of AICAR when incubated with ATP and formate (Fig. 2). Under the standard assay conditions, the MonoQ-purified PurP had a specific activity of 1.9 μmol/min/mg. Products Generated after Incubation of AICAR, ATP, and Formate with PurP—The incubation of a mixture of AICAR, ATP, and formate with PurP resulted in the loss of the arylamine of AICAR, confirmed by its inability to undergo the diazotization reaction (17Flaks J.G. Erwin M.J. Buchanan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 603-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the formamide product would not undergo such a reaction, this strongly indicated that it was the amino group of the arylamine that was formylated during the reaction. Based on its sequence, the MJ0136-derived enzyme, PurP, is considered to be a member of the ATP-grasp family of enzymes (9Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar); the other products of the reaction would be expected to be ADP and Pi. This reaction course was confirmed by the examination of the reaction products by NMR. 1H NMR confirmed the production of FAICAR with a spectrum identical to that produced by a sample of the synthetically produced FAICAR. 31P NMR spectroscopy of an incubated mixture of equal parts AICAR, ATP, and formate with PurP showed the conversion of 80% of the substrates to products. This was confirmed by the identification of 20% of the original ATP by its phosphate resonances consisting of two doublets (δ–5.58 and JPγ→Pβ = 15.9 Hz, δ–10.72 and JPα→Pβ = 16.5 Hz) for the α and γ phosphates, respectively; a triplet (δ–19.16) for the β phosphate of the triphosphate; and a singlet (δ 3.18) representing 20% of the original AICAR. The products ADP, FAICAR, and Pi, corresponding to 80% of the starting material, were identified by two doublets (δ–10.26 and JPα→Pβ = 18.0 Hz, δ–6.21 and JPβ→Pα = 18.3 Hz) for the ADP α and β phosphates, respectively; a singlet each for the orthophosphate (δ 1.75); and the FAICAR (δ 3.35). Longer incubation times failed to increase the extent of the conversion of substrates to products. The production of FAICAR was also confirmed by its cyclization to IMP, catalyzed by PurO. IMP was confirmed by its absorbance spectra (λmax = 260 nm) and by chromatography on MonoQ, where it eluted at the same retention volume as a known sample of IMP (19Graupner M. White R.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10859-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Alternate Substrates—PurP was found to specifically require formate as its acyl substrate.

A deep absorption feature is detected at 3 micrometers in the spectra of the trailing side of Amalthea, which is similar to that of the non-ice components of Callisto and can be attributed to hydrous minerals. These surface materials cannot be explained if the satellite formed at its present orbit by accreting from a circumjovian nebula. Amalthea and Thebe may be the remnants of Jupiter's inflowing building blocks that formed in the outer part or outside of the circumjovian nebula."

The DEAD box protein Dbp5p is an essential export factor conserved from yeast to man. A fraction of Dbp5p forms a complex with nucleoporins of the cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex.

In eukaryotic cells, protein synthesis requires the synthesis, processing, and export of mRNA. mRNA export occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; DBPs, DEAD box proteins; 5′FOA, 5′-fluoro-orotic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein particle.1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; DBPs, DEAD box proteins; 5′FOA, 5′-fluoro-orotic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein particle. very large macromolecular assemblies (60 MDa in yeast and about 120 MDa in higher organisms) that are the only channels for transport of molecules and macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. NPCs are composed of multiple copies of ∼30 proteins called nucleoporins that form a symmetrical, 8-fold assembly of spoke-like structures sandwiched between nuclear and cytoplasmic rings, named the NPC core, and filamentous structures that extend into both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments (1Rout M.P.

The strongest mRNA export defects are found in mutants affecting the nucleoporins Nup159p and Nup82p, which are components of the cytoplasmic filaments (5Hurwitz M.E. Strambio-de-Castillia C.

Interactions occur between the C-terminal coiled-coil regions of Nup82p and Nup159p, and Nup159p is lost from NPCs at 37 °C in strains where either Nup159p or Nup82p have been truncated to remove part of the coiled-coil region (5Hurwitz M.E.

A domain at the N terminus of Nup159p provides an important docking site for the essential mRNA export factor Dbp5p/Rat8p, a member of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases (10Schmitt C. von Kobbe C.

The yeast genome encodes more than 30 DEAD box proteins (DBPs), and one or more participate in every aspect of RNA metabolism from synthesis to turnover (reviewed in Refs. 12de la Cruz J. Kressler D.

It is generally believed that DEAD box proteins are RNA helicases, but only a limited number of DBPs have been studied biochemically. Several DBPs have been shown to unwind short double-stranded RNA substrates, and this sometimes requires participation of additional proteins that interact with the DBP (15Wagner J.D. Jankowsky E.

Three DEAD box proteins have been shown to mediate dissociation of stably bound proteins from RNA, but the enzymatic properties of most DEAD box proteins have not been determined (19Jankowsky E.

Science. 2004; 304: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The precise function performed by the DEAD box protein Dbp5p is not known. Dbp5p interacts directly with the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC and binds directly not only to Nup159p but also to Gle1p. The filaments also contain another nucleoporin, Nup42/Rip1p (21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two other proteins that interact with the filaments are Sac3p and Gfd1p (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The GFD1 gene was identified as high copy suppressor of rat8-2 and gle1-8 mutations and encodes a nonessential coiled-coil protein that interacts with NPCs. Two-hybrid analyses showed that Gfd1p interacts with Gle1p, Dbp5p, and Rip1p/Nup42p (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, Gfd1p has been found associated in a complex with Nab2p both in vivo and in vitro. Nab2p is a shuttling mRNP protein that accompanies the mRNA through the NPC (24Suntharalingam M. Alcazar-Roman A.R. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35384-35391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gfd1p was localized to the cytoplasm and to the nuclear rim (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that Nup159p, Nup82p, Nup42p/Rip1p, Gle1p, Sac3p, and Gfd1p are co-localized at the fibrils of the NPC, and all of them may contribute to the Dbp5p-binding site. A late step in mRNA export is remodeling of the mRNP complex to remove mRNA-binding proteins needed for mRNA export so that they can return to the nucleus for another round of export. Association of Dbp5p with the cytoplasmic filaments positions it to mediate this remodeling (10Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4332-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F.

However, Dbp5p also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and in Chironomus tentans it has been shown that Dbp5p binds to pre-mRNP co-transcriptionally and accompanies the mRNP to and through the nuclear pores (26Zhao J. Jin S.B. Bjorkroth B. Wieslander L. Daneholt B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An early role for Dbp5p during transcription was also suggested by its genetic and physical interactions with RNA polymerase II components and general transcription factors (27Estruch F. Cole C.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1664-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, Dbp5p could be loaded onto the mRNP early during pre-mRNA biogenesis and may have a later role at the NPC in remodeling the mRNP. By acting on mRNP while bound to the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC, Dbp5p may also be able to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to mediate translocation of the mRNP through the NPC. Mex67p is thought to play the role of export receptor for mRNA because it shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, can be cross-linked to poly(A)+in vivo, and interacts directly with the FG repeats of several nucleoporins (revised in Ref. 28Weis K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Mex67p to cellular mRNA is facilitated by the mRNA export adaptor Yra1p in association with the RNA helicase Sub2p (29Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Strahm Y. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4219-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both Yra1p and Sub2p are recruited to genes in a transcription-dependent manner through a complex called TREX (31Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). RNA processing factors are recruited to the elongating mRNA through association with the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. All pre-mRNA processing steps must be completed accurately before the mRNP can be exported (for a recent review see Ref. 32Dimaano C. Ullman K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3069-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In yeast, capping of nascent transcripts at their 5′ ends is performed by three enzymes: the RNA triphosphatase, Cet1p; the RNA guanylyltransferase, Ceg1p; and the 7-methytransferase, Abd1p. Both Ceg1p and Abd1p bind directly to the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (33Schroeder S.C. Zorio D.A. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cap structure is recognized by different proteins in the nucleus and in the cytosol (34McKendrick L. Thompson E. Ferreira J. Morley S.J. Lewis J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3632-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Linder P. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To explore further the role of the Dbp5p in mRNA export, we performed two-hybrid screens to identify additional partners of Dbp5p and its associated factor Gfd1p. We identified Zds1p as a factor interacting with Dbp5p, Gfd1p, and Rip1p. The S. cerevisiae ZDS1 gene and its paralog ZDS2 (zillions of different screens) have been isolated as multicopy suppressors of a diverse array of mutants, including those affecting Cdc42p, a GTPase involved in cell polarity, Cdc28p, a protein kinase required for cell cycle progression, Ceg1p, the RNA guanylyltranferase that participates in cap formation, and Tif1p (yeast eIF4A) (36Bandhakavi S. McCann R.O. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ZDS1 and ZDS2 are highly homologous. The homology at the C terminus is particularly striking, with a 100-amino acid stretch showing 82% identity. Unfortunately, amino acid sequences of Zds1p and Zds2p are uninformative with respect to its potential function. Here we report that Zds1p interacts physically with both Dbp5p and Gfd1p, both in vitro and in vivo. Most interestingly, ZDS1/2 mutants have genetic interactions with DBP5, and a zds1Δ/zds2Δ double mutant is synthetically lethal at 30 °C with mex67-5. We also found that the zds1Δ/zds2Δ double mutant has a moderate defect in mRNA export and that deletion of zds1 and zds2 from dbp5-2 or mex67-5 cells substantially increases their mRNA export defects at temperatures where these mutants are able to grow, and the mRNA export defect is moderate. Reciprocally, we found genetic interactions between DBP5 and both TIF1 and CEG1, two of the genes whose mutations are suppressed by overexpression of ZDS1. Together, the data presented here suggest that Zds1p associates with the complex formed by Dbp5p, Gfd1p, Rip1p/Nup42p, Nup82p, and Nup159p at the cytosolic fibrils of the NPC and is required for optimal mRNA export. Yeast Plasmid Constructions—The plasmid to express Dbp5p-Gal4p-BD (pDBP5-BD) was obtained by PCR-mediated generation of EcoRI and BamHI sites immediately upstream and downstream, respectively, of the DBP5 coding sequence, and the resulting fragment was ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBDU-C1. Dbp5p-Gal4p-AD was obtained by cloning the same fragment into pGAD-C1 (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid for the production of Gfd1p-Gal4p-BD (pGFD1-BD) was obtained by introducing an EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the complete coding sequence from the GFD1 gene into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGBDU-C1 (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same fragment was inserted into pGAD-C1 to obtain Gfd1p-Gal4p-AD. The plasmids to express the Gle1p, Rip1p-C66, and Rip1p-FG baits and the GST-Dbp5p, GST-Gfd1p, and GST-Rip1p-C66 fusions were the generous gifts from F. Stutz (University of Geneva) and are described previously (21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Full-length Zds1p and Zds2p fused to the Gal4p-AD were obtained by cloning a PCR fragment containing the entire open reading frame of ZDS1 or ZDS2 into pGAD-C1. YEpTIF1 was generated by PCR amplification of a fragment containing the TIF1 gene (between positions -500 from the AUG to +457 beyond the stop codon) and insertion between the SacI and PstI sites of YEplac181 (38Gietz R.D. Supino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2465) Google Scholar). YEpSTM1, containing the STM1 gene in the plasmid YEplac181, was a generous gift of P. Linder (Centre Mèdical Universitaire, Universitè de Gèneve). Yeast Strains and Genetic Methods—Wild type strains used in this work are FY23 (MATa leu2 Δ1 ura3-52 trp1Δ63) and FY86 (MATα leu2 Δ1 ura3-52 his3Δ200) and are described in Ref. 39Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar. Double mutant zds1Δ zds2Δ was obtained by consecutive substitution in the strain FY23 of the ZDS1 and ZDS2 coding sequences genes by TRP1 and KANR markers, respectively, as described previously (40Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringue J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Double mutant strain rat8-2 zds1Δ was obtained from strain CSY564 (MATα leu2Δ1 ura3-52 his3Δ200 rat8-2 [pRAT8/CEN/URA3]) by substitution of the ZDS1 coding sequence by the HIS3 marker and selection for cells that have lost the plasmid using 5′-fluoro-orotic acid (5′FOA) treatment. This strain was used to construct the triple rat8-2 zds1Δ zds2Δ by replacement of the ZDS2 coding sequence with the KANR marker. Double mutant mex67-5 zds1Δ was obtained from the mex67 shuffle strain (MATaade2 leu2 ura3 his3 trp1 mex67::HIS3 [pURA3-MEX67]) (29Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) by replacement of the ZDS1 coding sequence with the KANR marker, introduction of the mex67-5 allele in a pLEU2-mex67-5 plasmid, and 5′FOA treatment to select for pURA3-MEX67 plasmid loss. In the strain MATaade2 leu2 ura3 his3 trp1 mex67::HIS3 zds1Δ ::KANR [pURA3-MEX67], the ZDS2 coding sequence was replaced by the TRP1 marker and transformed with pLEU2-MEX67 and pLEU2-mex67-5 to obtain the strains used in Fig. 4C. ceg1 mutants strains were obtained by crossing the rat8-2 strain CSY550 (MATaleu2Δ1 ura3-52 trp1Δ63 rat8-2) (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with strain YSB245 (MATα ura3-52, leu2-3,112 his3Δ200 ceg1Δ1::HIS3 [pRS316-CEG1]) and selecting a strain carrying the rat8-2 allele and a disruption of the chromosomal CEG1 locus. In this strain the wild type CEG1 gene (in the pRS316-CEG1 plasmid) was replaced by ceg1 mutant alleles by transforming with plasmids pRS315-ceg1–12, pRS315-ceg1–34, pRS315-ceg1–63, pRS315-ceg1–237, and pRS315-ceg1–250, followed by 5′FOA treatment. All the ceg1 stains were obtained from S. Buratowski and are described previously (41Fresco L.D. Buratowski S. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 584-596PubMed Google Scholar, 42Cho E.J. Rodríguez C.R. Takagi T.

Strain bur6-1 rat8-2 (MATα, leu2Δ1, ura3-52, lys2-128, rat8-2, bur6-1 [pRAT8-31]) has been described previously (27Estruch F. Cole C.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1664-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For two-hybrid assays we used strain PJ69-4A (MATatrp1-901 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and EGY40 (MATα ura3-52 his3 trp1 leu2) transformed with the reporter plasmid pSH18-34 (URA3/2 μm/LexA::lacZ) (Invitrogen). Strains were grown using standard methods. For growth assays, yeast cells were diluted to an A600 of 0.1, and serial dilutions (1:10) were spotted onto YDP or selective plates and incubated at various temperatures. Where indicated, 5′FOA was added to synthetic complete media at 1 g/liter. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The two-hybrid reporter strain PJ69-4A (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing pDBP5-BD or pGFD1-BD was transformed with a set of S. cerevisiae genomic libraries cloned into the activation domain vectors pGAD-C1, pGAD-C2, and pGAD-C3 (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). About 106 transformants were plated on synthetic complete medium plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. Plasmids conferring the ability to grow on plates lacking histidine were isolated from appropriate yeast strains, amplified in Escherichia coli, and rechecked. The region of the yeast genome carried on plasmid inserts was determined by sequencing. In Situ Poly(A)+RNA Hybridization—Localization of poly(A)+ RNA by in situ hybridization with an oligo(dT)50 probe coupled to digoxigenin was performed as described previously (43Cole C.N. Heath C.V. Hodge C.A. Hammell C.M. Amberg D.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 568-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except in Fig. 5A, where a Cy3-end-labeled oligo(dT)50 was used (44Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assay—GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli and bound to glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were obtained by coupled T7 transcription-translation in reticulocyte lysates (TnT kit, Promega) as described previously (21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The DNA template for production of Gfd1p was obtained by amplifying yeast genomic DNA with the primers GFD1-5′ (5′-GGG CGA AAT TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CAC CAT ATG CCT TTA GAA TCT ATA TGG GCC G-3′) and GFD1-3′ (5′-GTG TAA ACT AAT GTC TCT TCA AGC-3′) and includes the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and the entire GFD1 coding sequence. The DNA template for production of the C-terminal part of Zds1p was obtained by amplifying yeast genomic DNA with the primers ZDS1-5′ (5′-GGG CGA ATT TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CAC CAT CAT GTC CAA TAG AGA TAA CGA GAG CAT-3′) and ZDS-INT (5′-GGG CGA ATAT TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CAC CAT GGA GCT CGA CAA TTC CAA AAA ACA-3′) and contains the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and ZDS1 sequence starting from codon 535. Attempts to produce full-length Zds1p were unsuccessful. The in vitro binding assays were performed as described previously (21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the product derived from in vitro transcription/translation. The beads were extensively washed, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and scanned using a Fuji FLA-300 PhosphorImager and Image Reader 1.0 software. Gfd1p Interacts in Vitro Directly with Dbp5p—The two-hybrid interaction between Gfd1p and Dbp5p, as reported previously (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), prompted us to determine whether there is a direct association between the two proteins. We isolated a GST-Dbp5p fusion protein produced in E. coli, and we analyzed its ability to interact with Gfd1p, obtained by in vitro translation in a reticulocyte lysate. Fig. 1 shows that 35S-labeled Gfd1p can be pulled down by GST-Dbp5p bound to glutathione-agarose beads but not by GST alone. This demonstrates that Gfd1p and Dbp5p interact directly. Identification of Zds1p as a Component of the Dbp5p-Gfd1p Complex—To follow up on our identification of GFD1 as a high copy suppressor of dbp5-2, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens, using Dbp5p-Gal4-BD and Gfd1p-Gal4-BD as baits and an S. cerevisiae genomic library fused to the GAL4 AD. We used a strain where interaction of the two-hybrid proteins is monitored through activation of a HIS3 reporter gene (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the proteins identified, we recovered Zds1p in both screens. Co-expression of Dbp5-Gal4-BD or Gfd1-Gal4-BD with Zds1-Gal4-AD allowed growth on media lacking histidine, but neither Dbp5-Gal4-BD, Gfd1-Gal4-BD, nor Zds1-Gal4-AD alone was able to activate the HIS3 reporter gene (Fig. 2A and results not shown). Although ZDS1 and the closely related ZDS2 have been isolated as multicopy suppressors in many genetic screens (see Refs. 36Bandhakavi S. McCann R.O. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and 45Bi E. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we know much less about their physical interactions, and neither was identified in large scale two-hybrid approaches. All the Zds1-Gal4-AD fusion proteins identified in the two-hybrid screen (seven for Dbp5p and two for Gfd1p) include the C-terminal part of Zds1p (with fusions starting at residues of Zds1p ranging from 530 to 682 (data not shown)), indicating that this is the domain that interacts with Dbp5p and Gfd1p. Most interestingly, this region is highly homologous in ZDS1 and ZDS2 genes, and several observations suggest that the activity of Zds1p may be carried by its C-terminal portion. Thus, truncated alleles of ZDS1, which encodes only amino acids 409–915 or 796–915, partially rescue the phenotypes of the zds1 zds2 double mutant strain (45Bi E. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 46Schwer B. Linder P. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, these truncated proteins are active as negative regulators of Cdc42p (45Bi E. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) or for dosage suppression of temperature-sensitive mutations affecting the yeast capping enzyme Ceg1p (46Schwer B. Linder P. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the C-terminal part of Zds2p (amino acids 781–942) was able to interact with Bcy1p in a two-hybrid assay (54Griffioen G. Branduardi P. Ballarini A. Anghileri P. Norbeck J. Baroni M.D. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By using the two-hybrid system, we were also able to detect an interaction between Gfd1p and the full-length Zds1p, although this interaction was weaker than with the truncated forms of Zds1p (Fig. 2B and results not shown). Besides the known interaction with Dbp5p, Fig. 2B also shows that Gfd1p interacts with itself and to a lesser extent with Zds2p. Because of the known physical interactions between Dbp5p, Gfd1p, and the fibrils of the NPC (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we examined the interaction of Zds1p with Rip1p and Gle1p. These two proteins are components of the Nup82p subcomplex, and interactions between Gle1p and Dbp5p and between Rip1p and Gfd1p have been reported (11Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 57"
