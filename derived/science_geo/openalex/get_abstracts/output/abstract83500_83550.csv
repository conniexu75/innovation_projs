https://openalex.org/W2048511673,"Unlike other RNA tumor viruses, avian leukosis viruses (which cause lymphomas and occasionally other neoplasms) lack discrete ""transforming genes"". We have analyzed the virus-related DNA and RNA of avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced tumors in an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of ALV oncogenesis. Our results show that viral gene products are not required for maintenance of neoplastic transformation. Primary and metastatic tumors are clonal and thus presumably derived from a single infected cell. Most importantly, tumors from different birds have integration sites in common. Tumor cells synthesize discrete new poly(A) RNAs consisting of viral sequences covalently linked to cellular sequences. These RNA species are expressed at high levels in tumor cells. Our results suggest that in lymphoid tumors, an ALV provirus is integrated adjacent to a specific cellular gene, and the insertion of the viral promoter adjacent to this gene results in its enhanced expression, leading to neoplasia. These results have potentially important implications for the mechanism of non-viral carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2059656737,Kinetic analysis of the uptake of carbon-14-labeled oleate in a single-pass perfusion of rat liver and saturable and specific binding of iodine-125-labeled albumin to hepatocytes in suspension suggest the existence of a receptor for albumin on the liver cell surface. The putative receptor appears to mediate uptake of albumin-bound fatty acids by the cell and may account for the efficient hepatic extraction of many other substances tightly bound to albumin.
https://openalex.org/W1596707465,"Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, a calmodulin-dependent enzyme, binds 1 mol of calmodulin/mol of kinase in the presence of calcium (Adelstein, R. S., and Klee, C. B. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, in press. This enzyme is a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase whether or not calmodulin is bound. When calmodulin is not bound to myosin kinase, protein kinase incorporates phosphate into two sites in myosin kinase. Under these circumstances, phosphorylation markedly lowers the rate of myosin kinase activity. The decrease in myosin kinase activity is due to a 10-20-fold increase in the amount of calmodulin necessary for 50% activation of kinase activity. The effect of phosphorylation on the activity of myosin kinase can be reversed by dephosphorylation using a purified phosphatase (Pato, M. D., and Adelstein, R. S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6535-6538) isolated from smooth muscle. When calmodulin is bound to myosin kinase, phosphate is incorporated into a single site with no effect on myosin kinase activity. The presence of at least two sites that can be phosphorylated in myosin kinase was confirmed by tryptic digestion of denatured myosin kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2149610907,"Each of twelve tumors induced by either Rous-associated virus-1 or -2 (RAV-1 or RAV-2) contained a predominant population of cells with ALV proviruses integrated at common sites, consistent with a clonal origin. Seven of nine RAV-2-induced bursal tumors contained single proviruses, and all seven solitary proviruses had suffered deletions. The detailed structures of four of these proviruses show that major deletions had occurred near or at the 5' ends, spanning sequences potentially important in the production of viral RNA. One provirus also lacked most of the information coding for the replicative functions of the virus. Restriction maps suggest that these four proviruses were inserted in similar regions of the host genome. We have studied virus-specific RNA in four bursal tumors and four cell lines derived from bursal tumors. No normal viral RNA species were detectable in three tumors containing single aberrant proviruses. However, transcripts of 2.2. kb which reacted only with a hybridization probe specific for the 5' end of viral RNA were observed in one of these three tumors. Analogous species, varying in length from 1.5 to 6.0 kb, were observed in a fourth bursal tumor with multiple proviruses and in all four cell lines. (This tumor and the cell lines also contained normal species of ALV mRNA and apparently normal proviral DNA). The structures of the aberrant proviruses and the absence of normal viral RNA in some tumors indicate that expression of viral genes is not required for maintenance of the tumor phenotype. In at least some cases, the mechanism of oncogenesis may involve stimulation of transcription of flanking cellular sequences by a viral promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2033341519,"We have analyzed the process of partial transcription termination (attenuation), which results in nonequimolar synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNAs during sequential transcription. Comparison of the level of transcription of defined regions of the VSV genome by DNA-RNA hybridization shows that attenuation occurs at or near the intergenic regions, rather than nonspecifically throughout the genome. Transcription decreases 29-33% across the junctions of the N-NS, NS-M and M-G genes, resulting in a cumulative effect on gene expression. This is the first example of a site-specific attenuation mechanism in a eucaryotic system. Analysis of the kinetics of transcription in vitro shows that transcription appears to be discontinuous, with significant pauses (2.5-5.7 min) occurring at or near the intergenic regions. Such pauses may occur during polyadenylation by a ""slippage"" mechanism at the U7 sequences present at each gene junction, or may be due to some other process, such as initiation or capping, which is slow relative to transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1974227175,"The yeast structural gene ADR2, coding for the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHII), has been isolated by complementation of function in transformed yeast. The chromosomal DNA from nine yeast strains with cis-dominant constitutive mutations (ADR3c) has been investigated by restriction enzyme analysis, using the cloned ADR2 DNA as a hybridization probe. Seven mutants appear to have insertions of approximately 5.6 kg near the 5' end of the ADR2-coding region. Four of these insertions have the same restriction pattern as the yeast transposable element Ty1. Two differ from Ty1 by the presence of an additional Hind III site, and a seventh insertion differs from Ty1 at a number of restriction sites. All are inserted in the same orientation with respect to the structural gene. A DNA fragment containing the ADR2 gene and adjacent sequences from a constitutive mutant has been cloned and shown by heteroduplex analysis to contain an insertion near the 5' end of the structural gene. The cloned insertion sequence hybridizes to multiple genomic DNA fragments, indicating that it contains a moderately repetitive sequence. Thus it appears that insertion of a transposable element near the 5' terminus of the structural gene can produce constitutive expression of a normally glucose-repressed enzyme. Such insertions seem to be the most common way of generating cis-dominant constitutive mutations of ADHII."
https://openalex.org/W2064982147,"Epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor inhibited follicle-stimulating hormone-dependent induction of luteinizing hormone receptor in cultured ovarian granulosa cells of the rat. In contrast, platelet-derived growth factor potentiated the induction of luteinizing hormone receptor by follicle-stimulating hormone. These results indicate that growth factors, well known for their effects on mitosis and DNA synthesis in cultured mammalian cells, are also able to modulate hormone-dependent differentiation in an endocrine target cell."
https://openalex.org/W1533181711,"The rate of endocytosis of cell surface-bound [3H]-asialo-orosomucoid was determined as a function of temperature. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were allowed to bind [3H]asialo-orosomucoid at 4 degrees C, washed to remove nonbound ligand, and internalization was then assessed by the resistance of cell-associated radioactivity to release by the Ca2+ chelator EDTA. At 10 degrees C or below, endocytosis is negligible. Above 10 degrees C, the rate of endocytosis is proportional to temperature but the increase of the rate of endocytosis with increasing temperature changes sharply at about 20 degrees C. From 10-20 degrees C, the apparent activation energy for endocytosis, calculated from an Arrhenius plot, is 45.9 kcal/mol and the temperature coefficient, Q10, is 15.6. However, between 20 and 41 degrees C, the calculated activation energy is 17.0 kcal/mol and the Q10 is 2.6. Although the rate of endocytosis of previously bound [3H]asialo-orosomucoid is very dependent on the temperature, the final extent of endocytosis is essentially temperature-independent between 14 and 37 degrees C. The results suggest that there are at least two steps in the overall process of endocytosis mediated by the asialoglycoprotein receptor on isolated hepatocytes which can be potentially rate-limiting, one at 10 degrees C and another at approximately 20 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2077080379,"NAD kinase, one of the first enzymes activated after fertilization of sea urchin eggs, is regulated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in vitro. The evidence is the requirement for low amounts of Ca2+ (Kd for Ca2+ of 4 x 10(-7) M) and the dissociation of a heat-stable activator from the enzyme which is similar to calmodulin on the basis of radioimmunoassay, activation of bovine brain phosphodiesterase and coelectrophoresis of a major protein of the activator fraction with bovine calmodulin. Also, the calcium stimulation of the enzyme is prevented by trifluoperazine, an inhibitor of calmodulin-associated reactions. In vivo studies show that the enzyme is activated by artificial parthenogenesis regimes that increase cytosolic Ca2+, but not by ammonia activation which only partially activates eggs and bypasses the Ca2+-rise step. These in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that calmodulin is part of the linkage between the rise in Ca2+ at fertilization and the turning on of egg metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2029693258,"We have cloned circular unintegrated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) DNA from infected rat hepatoma cells in bacteriophage lambda. Seven independent clones containing MMTV DNA of homogeneous length of 9 kb (five) or 10 kb (two) were identified. The five 9 kb clones had identical restriction maps consistent with that of 9 kb unintegrated DNA; the other two were aberrant. MMTV DNA inserts were purified, ligated and used for cotransfection of Ltk- cells together with a plasmid containing the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus. All Tk+ cell clones acquired new MMTV sequences and those transfected with the 9 kb MMTV DNA synthesized normal viral RNA and proteins. Viral gene expression was increased by the addition of dexamethasone."
https://openalex.org/W2015553689,"In order to obtain information on the possible functions of endogenous opiates in the primate cerebral cortex, we assessed the distribution of μ-like opiate receptors (which selectively bind 3H-labeled naloxone) and δ-like opiate receptors (which selectively bind 3H-labeled D-Ala2, D-Leu5-enkephalin) throughout the cerebral cortex of the rhesus monkey. Stereospecific [3H]naloxone binding sites increased in a gradient along hierarchically organized cortical systems that sequentially process modality-specific sensory information of a progressively more complex nature. Specific [3H]enkephalin binding sites, in contrast, were relatively evenly distributed throughout the cerebral cortex. These results, in combination with electrophysiological studies of monkeys and humans, suggest that μ-like opiate receptors may play a role in the affective filtering of sensory stimuli at the cortical level, that is, in emotion-induced selective attention."
https://openalex.org/W1489254411,"An endodeoxyribonuclease from HeLa cells acting on apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites has been purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The presence of Triton X-100 was necessary throughout the purification for stabilization and stimulation of activity. The endonuclease has an apparent native molecular weight of 32,000 determined by molecular sieving and an apparent subunit molecular weight of 41,000 as judged by its electrophoretic mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The activity has an absolute requirement for Mg2+ or Mn2+ and a broad pH optimum between 6.7 and 9.0 with maximal activity near pH 7.5. The enzyme has no detectable exonuclease activity, nor any endonuclease activity on untreated duplex or single-stranded DNA. It is inhibited by adenine, hypoxanthine, adenosine, AMP, ADP-ribose, and NAD+, but it is unaffected by caffeine, the pyrimidine bases, ADP, ATP, or NADH. The use of a variety of damaged DNA substrates provided no indication that the enzyme acts on other than AP sites. The enzyme appears to cleave AP DNA so as to leave deoxyribose-5-phosphate at the 5' terminus and a 3'-OH at the 3' terminus; it also removes deoxyribose-5-phosphate from AP DNA which has deoxyribose at the 3' terminus. Specific antibody has been produced in rabbits which interacts only with a 41,000-dalton protein present in the purified enzyme (presumably the enzyme itself), as well as with partially purified AP endonuclease fractions from human placenta and fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2035727353,"Taking advantage of the known specificity of interaction of HMG 14 and 17 with actively transcribed chromatin, we have covalently cross-linked these proteins to agarose and used this HMG 14-17 column to purify active nucleosomes. The column has been used to map the DNA regions surrounding the chicken alpha-globin genes for their capacity to bind HMG 14-17. The results show that at a crude level the HMG binding region correlates with the major stable primary transcript and the region of DNAase I sensitivity. At a finer level of analysis, however, the correspondence between DNAase I sensitivity and HMG binding is preserved, yet this chromosomal domain is shown to extend about 1 kb beyond the known primary transcript for the two chicken alpha genes. Why HMG 14 and 17 bind specifically to active nucleosomes is still not known. Our experiments suggest that at least one additional chemical difference distinguishes them. This difference is not reflected in the DNA:protein ratio; in the electrophoretic mobility of the particles or associated DNA; in the inner histone stoichiometry; in a marked degree of histone modification as assayed on Triton-urea gels; or in the presence of nonhistone proteins. Active nucleosomes can be dissociated and reconstituted and their ability to bind to HMG 14-17 restored. The ability to reconstitute binding should make it possible to determine whether the specificity for the interaction resides in the protein or the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1482074366,"Enzymes of the DNase I class, similar to bovine pancreatic DNase I with respect to molecular weight and ionic and pH requirements, were found in various tissues of the rat. Their analysis was facilitated by a method for detection of nucleases in crude extracts after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and subsequent renaturation of the enzymes. High levels of DNase I were found in digestive tissues, such as the parotid and submaxillary salivary glands and the lining of the small intestine., Appreciable levels were present in the lymph node, kidney, heart, prostate gland, and seminal vesicle. No activity was found in pancreatic extracts. However, under some conditions, tissues rich in proteases gave poor recovery of DNase I. Fourteen other tissues showed little or no DNase I. Inhibition of various DNase I enzymes by rabbit muscle actin was examined both in gels and in solution. Actin inhibited the bovine parotid DNase I as well as the bovine pancreatic enzyme, but actin did not inhibit any of the DNase I enzymes of the rat. This species specificity of actin inhibition makes it unlikely that the very strong association between monomeric actin and bovine DNase I is of general significance for cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W2034356183,"We have examined the chromatin structure of the histone gene repeat of D. melanogaster using an indirect end-labeling technique. Our results show that each DNA segment of the repeat is packaged into a precisely defined and characteristic structure, as follows: the nontranscribed spacers display a “normal” chromatin arrangement, with each nucleosome precisely positioned on the underlying DNA sequence; the 5′ ends of all five histone genes are in an exposed configuration, highly sensitive to both micrococcal nuclease and DNAase I; and the genes have an “altered” chromatin structure, as indicated by the weak and irregularly spaced nuclease cuts. This well-defined chromatin arrangement is established early in development and is stably maintained throughout the remainder of the D. melanogaster life cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1983334593,"The binding of [3H]diazepam to benzodiazepine receptors was studied in extensively washed membranes of rat cerebral cortex in the presence of the depressant barbiturate, pentobarbital. Pentobarbital, like the endogenous neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), increased the basal binding and also potentiated the GABA-enhanced binding of [3H]diazepam to benzodiazepine receptors by increasing the apparent affinity of [3H]diazepam for the benzodiazepine receptor. The concentrations of pentobarbital necessary to elicit these effects in vitro are the same as those observed after treatment with pharmacologically relevant doses, suggesting that a common neurochemical association may exist between these types of compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1980679596,"Long-term administration of imipramine caused a decrease in serotonin2 receptor binding in rat brain cerebral cortex, an effect that was abolished by ovariectomy. In contrast, ovariectomy had no effect on imipramine-induced decreases in hippocampal serotonin or in cerebral cortical and hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptor binding. Administration of estradiol or progesterone separately or in combination reestablished the effect of imipramine treatment on cortical serotonin2 receptors. These results suggest that ovarian steroids may play an important, but subtle, role in the neurochemical and perhaps clinical response to this drug."

https://openalex.org/W182195279,"We have examined the effects of histone hyperacetylation upon nuclease digestion of nuclei and subsequent fractionation of chromosomal material in the presence of MgCl2. DNase I shows a maximum sensitivity towards hyperacetylated nuclei at somewhat elevated ionic strengths (150-200 mM NaCl), whereas micrococcal nuclease exhibits no specificity for acetylated nuclei over a broad range of ionic strengths. Fractionation in the presence of MgCl2 of hyperacetylated nuclei digested with micrococcal nuclease results in a substantial increase in the amount of soluble chromatin relative to that obtained with control nuclei. This increased yield of Mg2+-soluble chromatin results from the recruitment into this fraction of oligonucleosomes containing extremely hyperacetylated histones. These results suggest that contiguous nucleosomes containing highly acetylated histones may be altered in their ability to interact with themselves and with other nucleosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1550313514,"The influence of H+ and K+ on the partial reactions and transport of gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase was studied. Using transient kinetics, the effects and sidedness of effects of H+ and K+ on formation and breakdown of phosphoenzyme were determined in intact and lyophilized reconstituted vesicles in the absence and presence of gramicidin. Whereas increasing H+ concentrations on the ATP-binding face of the vesicles accelerates phosphorylation, increasing K+ concentrations inhibits phosphorylation. Increasing H+ on this side reduces K+ inhibition of the phosphorylation rate. At low ATP/K+ ratios, the phosphorylation step can become rate-limiting for steady state hydrolysis. Decreasing H+ accelerates dephosphorylation in the absence of K+. K+ on the internal or luminal face of the vesicles accelerates dephosphorylation, and this rate is reduced with increasing H+ concentrations. At low internal pH, K+-dependent dephosphorylation may become rate-limiting. H+ transport measurements using fluorescence quenching of acridine orange show that whereas internal K+ is required for H+ transport, external K+ inhibits the rate of formation of a pH gradient, and the inhibition is reduced by decreasing medium pH. The pH optimum for ATPase activity and transport correlated in the vesicles, and the K0.5 of K+ for transport correlated with data for intact parietal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1548220583,"Comparison of the parameters of Ca and Sr binding to bovine brain calmodulin with the activation of bovine brain phosphodiesterase by Ca2+ and Sr2+ at different calmodulin concentrations allows a quantitative description of the mechanism of activation of the enzyme. Equilibrium dialysis studies show that calmodulin possesses three high affinity (K'diss = 6 micoM) and one low affinity (K'diss = 200 microM) sites for Ca2+. All four sites display the same affinity for Sr2+ with K'diss = 180 microM. In the presence of calmodulin, soluble bovine brain phosphodiesterase is activated by Sr2+ to the same extent as by Ca2+. The activation of the enzyme shows the same Ca2+/Sr2+ selectivity ratio of 30 as the binding of the metal ions to calmodulin. Based on the findings that the Ca2+ or Sr2+ concentration at half-maximal activation of the enzyme depends on the concentration of calmodulin present, a quantitative analysis of activation was carried out as a function of the four calmodulin-metal complex species (CaM . Men). The data show that the activating species are CaM . Ca3, CaM . Ca4 or CaM . Sr3, CaM . Sr4. The interaction of these activating species with phosphodiesterase follows the Hill equation with a dissociation constant of 10(-9) M and a Hill coefficient of 2, irrespective of the binding characteristics of Ca2+ or Sr2+. The latter value agrees well with the fact that phosphodiesterase possesses two binding sites for calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1600665008,"We report the complete DNA sequence of the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifH gene, the gene which codes for component 2 (Fe protein or nitrogenase reductase) of the nitrogenase enzyme complex. The amino acid sequence of the K. pneumoniae nitrogenase Fe protein is deduced from the DNA sequence. The K. pneumoniae Fe protein contains 292 amino acids, has a Mr = 31,753, and contains 9 cysteine residues. We compare the amino acid sequence of the K. pneumoniae protein with available amino acid sequence data on nitrogenase Fe proteins from two other species, Clostridium pasteurianum and Azotobacter vinelandii. The C. pasteurianum Fe protein, for which the complete sequence is known, shows 67% homology with the K. pneumoniae Fe protein. Extensive regions of strong conservation (90-95%) are found, while other regions show relatively poor conservation (30-35%). It is suggested that these strongly conserved regions are of special importance to the function of this enzyme, and the findings are discussed in the light of evolutionary theories on the origin of nif genes."

Data for the photoreduction of ferricytochrome c at derivatized p-type silicon photocathodes show directly that the rate of reduction is mass transport-limited.

https://openalex.org/W1606631985,"A fluorescent derivative of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist analog, [D-Lys6]GnRH, was synthesized for receptor studies and shown to be biologically active. The rhodamine-derivatized peptide (Rh-GnRH) retained 40% of the receptor binding activity of [D-Lys6]GnRH, and 50% of the luteinizing hormone-releasing activity assayed in cultured pituitary cells. The fluorescent analog was employed to visualize the distribution of GnRH receptors in cultured pituitary cells, using the technique of video-intensified fluorescence microscopy. The binding of Rh-GnRH was confined to the large gonadotrophs which comprised 15% of the cell population. The specificity of the binding was shown by the absence of significant fluorescence in the presence of a 100-fold excess of [D-Lys6]GnRH, or when Rh-GnRH was incubated with choriocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, or 3T3 cell lines devoid of GnRH receptors. The interaction of Rh-GnRH with living pituitary cells was characterized by an initial diffuse distribution, followed by the formation of polar aggregates that later appeared to be internalized. These observations emphasize the value of fluorescent derivatives of GnRH for elucidating the course of the interaction with specific receptors on pituitary gonadotrophs. The initial results indicate that GnRH-receptor complexes undergo aggregation during stimulation of luteinizing hormone release, and are later internalized for subsequent degradation and/ or intracellular actions."
https://openalex.org/W1973591990,"Abstract Cell transformation by polyoma virus appears to result from the activity of three viral early proteins, two of which (small and middle T antigens) are likely to be required for the expression of transformation, while large T antigen (the A gene product) probably promotes only its establishment. To study the role of this viral protein in polyoma transformation, rat cells were transfected with tsA polyoma DNA at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, or with purified fragments of wild-type polyoma DNA, some of which could not encode an intact large T antigen. The transformation efficiency, as assayed by colony formation in agar medium, was about 20 fold higher in the presence of an active A gene product than in its absence. However, fully transformed colonies could be obtained in the absence of an active large T antigen, and these transformants were tumorigenic in syngeneic animals. Restriction enzyme analysis of viral DNA sequences integrated into the genome of the transformed cell lines showed a strong correlation between the presence of an active viral A gene product and integrations in head-to-tail tandem arrangement of viral DNA molecules. In the absence of a functional large T antigen, transformants were found to contain multiple nontandem insertions of viral DNA segments shorter than the infecting polyoma molecules. These results indicate that polyoma DNA sequences can integrate into the host genome in tandem and nontandem arrangements and that the former mode of integration increases the efficiency of transformation and is promoted by large T antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1652542971,"Cloned cDNA sequences specific for alpha or beta tubulin mRNAs have been used to show that the multigene families which encode either alpha or beta tubulin are unlinked and dispersed throughout the chicken genome. Fractions of chicken chromosomes partially purified by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient were digested with restriction endonucleases and electrophoresed on agarose gels. The DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized to labeled probes constructed from cloned cDNA sequences specific for alpha or beta tubulin. We find alpha tubulin sequences on four different chicken chromosomes and beta tubulin sequences on at least two different chromosomes. Moreover, using chicken chromosomes further purified with a fluorescent cell sorter, we have been able unambiguously to localize alpha tubulin genes to chromosome 1 and chromosome 8 and two of the beta genes to chromosome 2."
https://openalex.org/W1482650196,"Synthetic analogs of (2'-5')oligo(A) were assayed for endonuclease activation in cell extracts and for inhibition of protein synthesis in intact cells. The analogs are triadenylates: (i) methylated in the terminal 3'-OH; (ii) methylated at all three 3'-OH groups; (iii) with different numbers of phosphate groups at the 5' terminus or with a methylene group between the beta- and gamma-phosphate. Only 5'-phosphorylated monomethylated analogs activate an endonuclease in cell extracts and are powerful inhibitors of protein synthesis in intact cells. The analogs with only one 5'-terminal phosphate may require addition of another phosphate for activity since the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine prevents endonuclease activation by this compound but not by the di- and triphosphate-terminated triadenylates. These results suggest that two terminal phosphates and one or two free 3'-OH are required for endonuclease activation and inhibition of protein synthesis. The monomethylated analogs are more active than (2'-5')pppA3 because of their resistance to degradation by cellular enzymes. Accordingly, the monomethylated analogs cause a prolonged inhibition of protein synthesis in human fibroblasts treated with nanomolar concentrations of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1495854442,"Quiescent cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts incubated with human alpha-thrombin (14-219 pM) incorporated [methyl-3H]thymidine proportional to concentration. Inactivated forms of this protease (e.g. active-site-conjugated alpha-thrombin or its hirudin complex) had no mitogenic activity and did not compete with 124I-alpha-thrombin for binding to specific plasma membrane receptors. The noncoagulant but esterolytic active forms, gamma- and nitro-alpha-thrombins, were weakly mitogenic and correspondingly competed weakly for binding. Trypsin competed equally as well as native thrombin for binding, whereas chymotrypsin, elastase, and human urokinase competed with 80-fold less affinity. Plasma, arginine-specific proteases associated with nerve or epidermal growth factors, insulin, and insulin-like growth factors did not compete for binding. These data demonstrate that (a) functional catalytic residues of the thrombin active site are necessary for mitogenic activity and for specific binding; (b) regions adjacent to the active site, i.e. the high affinity protein recognition site, appear to enhance binding; and (c) the receptor can discriminate between other proteases and binds those which are also mitogens for the avian cells. The characteristics of 125I-alpha-thrombin binding were determined, and it was found to be (i) proportional to cell number; (ii) optimal at pH 6.8; (iii) 70-90% specific; (iv) at equilibrium after 60 min of incubation at 22-24 degrees C or 180 min at 0-4 degrees C (the rate constants for association, i.e. ka, at 22 and 4 degrees C were 18 and 1.1 x 10(7) M-1 min-1, respectively); and (v) essentially nondissociable. Nondissociable thrombin that bound during incubation at 0-4 degrees C was distributed equally between trypsin-sensitive and insensitive compartments. Thrombin associated with the former was released into the media when the cells were incubated at 0-4 degrees C with hirudin or hydroxylamine, or transferred to the insensitive compartment when incubated at 22 degrees C. Finally, confluent cultures of fibroblasts bind 2-3 x 10(4) 125I-alpha-thrombin molecules/cell with an apparent binding constant, i.e. Kd, of 0.7 nM (a true Kd could not be determined because of the irreversible nature of thrombin binding). The binding capacity per cell and the apparent Kd value increased proportionally to an increase in culture density."

In addition, the alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon polypeptides of the F1 portion of the ATPase were also detected and their molecular weights correspond to the in vivo peptides. A 4.3-kilobase HindIII-generated lambda unc DNA fragment was cloned onto plasmid vectors and was demonstrated to contain the genes for the three F0 and two of the F1 (alpha, delta) subunits. In addition, the polypeptides synthesized in vitro were precipitable with antibody prepared against purified F1."

Densitometric analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of cell lysates showed that ACTH induced a 20% decrease in actin content. These results were fully confirmed by quantitation of actin by the DNase 1 inhibition assay. The decrease in actin is hormone-specific, concentration-dependent, and correlates temporally with the morphological change induced by ACTH. The change in actin content and the reorganization of microfilament ultrastructure may together mediate hormone regulation of cell shape at the cytoskeletal level."
https://openalex.org/W2437126576,"The dephosphorylation of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase was studied using two purified rabbit skeletal muscle protein phosphatases. The first enzyme (Mr = 32,000) corresponds to the form we have previously termed protein phosphatase C. Phosphorylase kinase was found to be rapidly dephosphorylated by this enzyme. The site of dephosphorylation was examined, and it was shown that this enzyme was relatively specific for the dephosphorylation of the beta-subunit phosphate, as compared to the alpha-subunit phosphate, of phosphorylase kinase. Phosphate release from the beta-subunit was approximately 100-fold faster than from the alpha-subunit. More importantly, dephosphorylation of the beta-subunit phosphate was not significantly affected by phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit. The dephosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase by a second low molecular weight protein phosphatase, Mr = 33,500, was also studied. The specific activity of this enzyme toward phosphorylase kinase was only a fraction of that exhibited by the Mr = 32,000 phosphatase. This enzyme removed phosphate from both the alpha- and beta-subunits but more rapidly (about 4-fold) from the alpha-subunit. With neither of these enzyme preparations was there any evidence for the regulation of beta-subunit dephosphorylation by phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit as proposed by Cohen and Antoniw ((1973) FEBS Lett. 34, 43-47)."
https://openalex.org/W1571909805,The distribution of thermal stability in the Escherichia coli lac control region is evaluated from the melting behavior of 5 short (80-219 base pairs (bp)) sequenced DNA restriction fragments containing various parts of this sequence. The thermal denaturation of these fragments was measured at 3 salt concentrations. The previous notion that the melting curves for small fragments are sharp and asymmetric in 0.01 M Na+ and broadened and less asymmetric at 0.105 and 0.505 M Na+ is confirmed and the possible explanations are discussed. The existence of two thermodynamic boundaries in this region is also confirmed. The exact location of the boundary upstream of the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CAP) binding site is accurately determined from melting experiments at 260 and 282 nm. The secondary boundary located between the promoter and operator sequence is apparent at the two higher salt concentrations and begins to disappear at the lower salt concentration. The physical interpretation of the melting experiments is compared to the results of theoretical predictions derived from the known sequence of the fragments.

https://openalex.org/W1495320524,"The enzymes involved in the metabolism of vitamin B6 were measured in Morris hepatomas and livers of female Buffalo rats fed pyridoxine-sufficient and deficient diets. Pyridoxal phosphate levels in plasmas hepatomas, and livers were also determined. Nontumor-bearing animals were maintained as controls. Regardless of the B6 nutritional status, the concentration of pyridoxal phosphate was lower in the hepatomas than in the livers of the host animals. The apoenzyme levels of ornithine decarboxylase, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme, were higher in the hepatomas from animals fed the B6-deficient diet. Liver pyridoxine kinase activity was higher in B6-sufficient animals. In contrast, tumor pyridoxine kinase activity was influenced by B6 intake and was significantly lower than that in host liver. Liver pyridoxine phosphate oxidase activity was not significantly affected by B6 intake or by the presence of tumor. In contrast, hepatomas had little or no pyridoxine phosphate oxidase activity. Pyridoxine phosphate phosphatase activity was elevated in tumors relative to livers. These data indicate that the metabolism of vitamin B6 is markedly different in the hepatomas than in host or control livers and suggest that the tumor is apparently incapable of the complete synthesis of co-enzymatically active pyridoxal phosphate from inactive precursor forms such as pyridoxine."
https://openalex.org/W2134207436,"The principles of Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis were applied to directly relate the concentration of serum growth factors and individual nutrients in the culture medium to the multiplication rate of a population of normal (N-HLF) and SV40 virus-transformed (SV-HLF) human lung fibroblasts. When all nutrient concentrations were optimal and in steady state, the concentration of serum factors that was required to support a half-maximal rate of proliferation of both N-HLF and SV-HLF was similar. When the serum factor concentration was optimal and constant, SV-HLF cells exhibited a reduced requirement (p less than 0.001) for 12 of 27 individual nutrients that were examined. Serum factors control the cellular requirement for Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, phosphate ions, and 2-oxocarboxylic acids for multiplication of N-HLF (McKeehan, W. L., and McKeehan, K. A. (1980) Proc. Natl, Acad, Sci, U. S. A. 77, 3417-3421). SV-HLF exhibited a constitutively reduced requirement for Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ which partially removed the requirement for the 3 ions for multiplication of SV-HLF from the control of serum factors. The results suggest that SV40 virus transformation confers a growth advantage on human lung fibroblasts by alteration of their quantitative requirements for specific nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W14202267,"Perfusion of livers from fed rats with medium containing glucagon (2 x 10(-10) or 1 x 10(-8) M) resulted in both time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of glycogen synthase phosphatase. Expected changes occurred in cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, glycogen synthase, and glycogen phosphorylase. The effect of glucagon on synthase phosphatase was partially reversed by simultaneous addition of insulin (4 x 10(-8) M), an effect paralleled by a decrease in cAMP. Addition of arginine vasopressin (10 milliunits/ml) resulted in a similar inactivation of synthase phosphatase and activation of phosphorylase, but independent of any changes in cAMP or its kinase. Phosphorylase phosphatase activity was unaffected by any of these hormones. Synthase phosphatase activity, measured as the ability of a crude homogenate to catalyze the conversion of purified rat liver synthase D to the I form, was no longer inhibited by glucagon or vasopressin when phosphorylase antiserum was added to the phosphatase assay mixture in sufficient quantity to inhibit 90-95% of the phosphorylase a activity. These data support the following conclusions: 1) hepatic glycogen synthase phosphatase activity is acutely modulated by hormones, 2) hepatic glycogen synthase phosphatase and phosphorylase phosphatase are regulated differently, 3) the hormone-mediated changes in synthase phosphatase cannot be explained by an alteration of the synthase D molecule affecting its behavior as a substrate, and 4) glycogen synthase phosphatase activity is at least partially controlled by the level of phosphorylase a."
https://openalex.org/W1523522394,"When cell-free extracts of chickens embryo fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, a protein having a Mr of 36,000 was phosphorylated. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of a mixture of phosphorylated proteins formed in vitro and in vivo showed that they are indistinguishable. The in vitro phosphorylation of the Mr = 36,000 protein was completely inhibited by serum isolated from rabbit bearing tumor formed by RSV. In addition, phosphorylation of the 36K protein does not occur if the extract was made from fibroblasts transformed by RSV tsNY68 and cultured at 42 degrees C or from fibroblasts infected with transformation defective RSV. The cell free-phosphorylation of 36K protein was dependent on Mg2+ ions but not dependent on exogenously added cyclic AMP."

https://openalex.org/W1487522085,"The stability of purified poliovirus RNA in cell-free translation systems prepared from HeLa cells or rabbit reticulocytes has been examined. Degradation of the RNA occurs with a t1/2 of approximately 35 min at 30 degrees C under conditions used for in vitro translation. Degradation is due in part to activity in the cell lysate, and in part to contaminants in the commercial preparations of creatine phosphokinase used in the energy-regenerating system. Addition of crude preparations of initiation factors significantly slows degradation, presumably as a result of protein-RNA interactions which confer resistance to nuclease action. Prior treatment of RNA with methylmercury hydroxide has no effect on degradation rates. On the other hand, endogenous mRNA, present as a messenger ribonucleoprotein particle in extracts from poliovirus-infected HeLa cells, remains completely intact during in vitro translation. These infected cell extracts synthesize the normal complement of viral proteins and utilize two different initiation sites for translation. Treatment of the infected cell extract with micrococcal nuclease destroys the endogenous mRNA. Subsequent addition of exogenous RNA to the same extract results in the formation of a protein-associated RNA particle with sedimentation properties slightly different from the endogenous messenger ribonucleoprotein, and the added RNA is unstable. We conclude that two initiation sites can be utilized on intact poliovirus mRNA, and fragmentation of the RNA is not prerequisite for generation of a second site in this RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1584099368,"The covalently-attached fatty acid of the membrane glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus was fluorescently labeled biologically by isolating vesicular stomatitis virus from infected baby hamster kidney clone 21 cells that had been grown in the presence of 16(9-anthroyloxy)palmitate. The fluorescent labeling was specific for the G protein; the other viral membrane protein, the matrix (M) protein, was not labeled. Steady state fluorescence anisotropy of the 16(9-anthroyloxy)palmitate-labeled G protein reconstituted into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles indicated that the fatty acid attached to G protein is located in a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine domain that does not undergo the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W1534784694,"A method for unambiguously determining the initiator methionine residue and the adjacent NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of cell-free translation products of eukaryotic messenger RNA is described. In this procedure, the NH2 termini of nascent peptides are blocked by incorporating labeled formylmethionine instead of methionine, using yeast initiator tRNA in the wheat germ cell-free system. After immunoprecipitation of the desired product the radiolabeled material is treated with dansyl-Cl to irreversibly block all remaining free amino groups. The material is then deformylated by mild acid hydrolysis and subjected to automated Edman degradation. Only those products that had been synthesized with formylmethionine residues at their NH2-termini can then give rise to labeled phenylthiohydantoin derivatives during degradation. Using this method, we have defined the initiation sites in both rat preproinsulin and pregrowth hormone messenger RNAs."
