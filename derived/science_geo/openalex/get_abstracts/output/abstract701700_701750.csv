https://openalex.org/W4298008749,"Cancer-microbe associations have been explored for centuries, but cancer-associated fungi have rarely been examined. Here, we comprehensively characterize the cancer mycobiome within 17,401 patient tissue, blood, and plasma samples across 35 cancer types in four independent cohorts. We report fungal DNA and cells at low abundances across many major human cancers, with differences in community compositions that differ among cancer types, even when accounting for technical background. Fungal histological staining of tissue microarrays supported intratumoral presence and frequent spatial association with cancer cells and macrophages. Comparing intratumoral fungal communities with matched bacteriomes and immunomes revealed co-occurring bi-domain ecologies, often with permissive, rather than competitive, microenvironments and distinct immune responses. Clinically focused assessments suggested prognostic and diagnostic capacities of the tissue and plasma mycobiomes, even in stage I cancers, and synergistic predictive performance with bacteriomes."

Pan-cancer analysis of multiple body sites revealed tumor-associated mycobiomes at up to 1 fungal cell per 104 tumor cells. In lung cancer, Blastomyces was associated with tumor tissues. In stomach cancers, high rates of Candida were linked to the expression of pro-inflammatory immune pathways, while in colon cancers Candida was predictive of metastatic disease and attenuated cellular adhesions. Across multiple GI sites, several Candida species were enriched in tumor samples and tumor-associated Candida DNA was predictive of decreased survival. The presence of Candida in human GI tumors was confirmed by external ITS sequencing of tumor samples and by culture-dependent analysis in an independent cohort. These data implicate the mycobiota in the pathogenesis of GI cancers and suggest that tumor-associated fungal DNA may serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.

We present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic, epigenetic, and spatial atlas of human cortical organoid development, comprising over 610,000 cells, from generation of neural progenitors through production of differentiated neuronal and glial subtypes. We show that processes of cellular diversification correlate closely to endogenous ones, irrespective of metabolic state, empowering the use of this atlas to study human fate specification. We define longitudinal molecular trajectories of cortical cell types during organoid development, identify genes with predicted human-specific roles in lineage establishment, and uncover early transcriptional diversity of human callosal neurons. The findings validate this comprehensive atlas of human corticogenesis in vitro as a resource to prime investigation into the mechanisms of human cortical development.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems increase the risk for intestinal GVHD, but mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we found that treatment with meropenem, a commonly used carbapenem, aggravates colonic GVHD in mice via the expansion of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT). BT has a broad ability to degrade dietary polysaccharides and host mucin glycans. BT in meropenem-treated allogeneic mice demonstrated upregulated expression of enzymes involved in the degradation of mucin glycans. These mice also had thinning of the colonic mucus layer and decreased levels of xylose in colonic luminal contents. Interestingly, oral xylose supplementation significantly prevented thinning of the colonic mucus layer in meropenem-treated mice. Specific nutritional supplementation strategies, including xylose supplementation, may combat antibiotic-mediated microbiome injury to reduce the risk for intestinal GVHD in allo-HSCT patients.

https://openalex.org/W4298008797,"Regulatory landscapes drive complex developmental gene expression, but it remains unclear how their integrity is maintained when incorporating novel genes and functions during evolution. Here, we investigated how a placental mammal-specific gene, Zfp42, emerged in an ancient vertebrate topologically associated domain (TAD) without adopting or disrupting the conserved expression of its gene, Fat1. In ESCs, physical TAD partitioning separates Zfp42 and Fat1 with distinct local enhancers that drive their independent expression. This separation is driven by chromatin activity and not CTCF/cohesin. In contrast, in embryonic limbs, inactive Zfp42 shares Fat1's intact TAD without responding to active Fat1 enhancers. However, neither Fat1 enhancer-incompatibility nor nuclear envelope-attachment account for Zfp42's unresponsiveness. Rather, Zfp42's promoter is rendered inert to enhancers by context-dependent DNA methylation. Thus, diverse mechanisms enabled the integration of independent Zfp42 regulation in the Fat1 locus. Critically, such regulatory complexity appears common in evolution as, genome wide, most TADs contain multiple independently expressed genes."
https://openalex.org/W4298008837,"Interactions between angiogenesis and neurogenesis regulate embryonic brain development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of vascular cell maturation is lacking, especially in the prenatal human brain. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, single-cell transcriptomics, and histological and ultrastructural analyses, we show that an ensemble of endothelial and mural cell subtypes tile the brain vasculature during the second trimester. These vascular cells follow distinct developmental trajectories and utilize diverse signaling mechanisms, including collagen, laminin, and midkine, to facilitate cell-cell communication and maturation. Interestingly, our results reveal that tip cells, a subtype of endothelial cells, are highly enriched near the ventricular zone, the site of active neurogenesis. Consistent with these observations, prenatal vascular cells transplanted into cortical organoids exhibit restricted lineage potential that favors tip cells, promotes neurogenesis, and reduces cellular stress. Together, our results uncover important mechanisms into vascular maturation during this critical period of human brain development."
https://openalex.org/W4298138042,"Myelin plasticity occurs when newly formed and pre-existing oligodendrocytes remodel existing patterns of myelination. Myelin remodeling occurs in response to changes in neuronal activity and is required for learning and memory. However, the link between behavior-induced neuronal activity and circuit-specific changes in myelination remains unclear. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging and targeted labeling of learning-activated neurons in mice, we explore how the pattern of intermittent myelination is altered on individual cortical axons during learning of a dexterous reach task. We show that behavior-induced myelin plasticity is targeted to learning-activated axons and occurs in a staged response across cortical layers in the mouse primary motor cortex. During learning, myelin sheaths retract, which results in lengthening of nodes of Ranvier. Following motor learning, addition of newly formed myelin sheaths increases the number of continuous stretches of myelination. Computational modeling suggests that motor learning-induced myelin plasticity initially slows and subsequently increases axonal conduction speed. Finally, we show that both the magnitude and timing of nodal and myelin dynamics correlate with improvement of behavioral performance during motor learning. Thus, learning-induced and circuit-specific myelination changes may contribute to information encoding in neural circuits during motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W4298137907,"Environmental cues influence the highly dynamic morphology of microglia. Strategies to characterize these changes usually involve user-selected morphometric features, which preclude the identification of a spectrum of context-dependent morphological phenotypes. Here we develop MorphOMICs, a topological data analysis approach, which enables semiautomatic mapping of microglial morphology into an atlas of cue-dependent phenotypes and overcomes feature-selection biases and biological variability. We extract spatially heterogeneous and sexually dimorphic morphological phenotypes for seven adult mouse brain regions. This sex-specific phenotype declines with maturation but increases over the disease trajectories in two neurodegeneration mouse models, with females showing a faster morphological shift in affected brain regions. Remarkably, microglia morphologies reflect an adaptation upon repeated exposure to ketamine anesthesia and do not recover to control morphologies. Finally, we demonstrate that both long primary processes and short terminal processes provide distinct insights to morphological phenotypes. MorphOMICs opens a new perspective to characterize microglial morphology."
https://openalex.org/W4298150007,"Simian arteriviruses are endemic in some African primates and can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers when they cross into primate hosts of new species. We find that CD163 acts as an intracellular receptor for simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV; a simian arterivirus), a rare mode of virus entry that is shared with other hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses (e.g., Ebola and Lassa viruses). Further, SHFV enters and replicates in human monocytes, indicating full functionality of all of the human cellular proteins required for viral replication. Thus, simian arteriviruses in nature may not require major adaptations to the human host. Given that at least three distinct simian arteriviruses have caused fatal infections in captive macaques after host-switching, and that humans are immunologically naive to this family of viruses, development of serology tests for human surveillance should be a priority."
https://openalex.org/W4297981047,"Biochemical processes often require spatial regulation and specific microenvironments. The general lack of organelles in bacteria limits the potential of bioengineering complex intracellular reactions. Here, we demonstrate synthetic membraneless organelles in Escherichia coli termed transcriptionally engineered addressable RNA solvent droplets (TEARS). TEARS are assembled from RNA-binding protein recruiting domains fused to poly-CAG repeats that spontaneously drive liquid-liquid phase separation from the bulk cytoplasm. Targeting TEARS with fluorescent proteins revealed multilayered structures with composition and reaction robustness governed by non-equilibrium dynamics. We show that TEARS provide organelle-like bioprocess isolation for sequestering biochemical pathways, controlling metabolic branch points, buffering mRNA translation rates, and scaffolding protein-protein interactions. We anticipate TEARS to be a simple and versatile tool for spatially controlling E. coli biochemistry. Particularly, the modular design of TEARS enables applications without expression fine-tuning, simplifying the design-build-test cycle of bioengineering."
https://openalex.org/W4297984766,"Vitamin D metabolism centers on kidney regulation of Cyp27b1 by mineralotropic hormones, including induction by parathyroid hormone (PTH), suppression by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), and reciprocal regulations for Cyp24a1. This coordinated genomic regulation results in production of endocrine 1,25(OH)2D3, which, together with PTH and FGF23, controls mineral homeostasis. However, how these events are coordinated is unclear. Here, using in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in mouse kidney, we demonstrate that PTH activation rapidly induces increased recruitment of phosphorylated (p-133) CREB (pCREB) and its coactivators, CBP (CREB-binding protein) and CRTC2 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2), to previously defined kidney-specific M1 and M21 enhancers near the Cyp27b1 gene. At distal enhancers of the Cyp24a1 gene, PTH suppression dismisses CBP with only minor changes in pCREB and CRTC2 occupancy, all of which correlate with decreased genomic activity and reduced transcripts. Treatment of mice with salt-inducible kinase inhibitors (YKL-05-099 and SK-124) yields rapid genomic recruitment of CRTC2 to Cyp27b1, limited interaction of CBP, and a transcriptional response for both Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 that mirrors the actions of PTH. Surprisingly, we find that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppression increases the occupancy of CRTC2 in the M1 enhancer, a novel observation for CRTC2 and 1,25(OH)2D3 action. Suppressive actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23 at the Cyp27b1 gene are associated with reduced CBP recruitment at these CREB-module enhancers that disrupts full PTH induction. Our findings show that CRTC2 contributes to transcription of both Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1, demonstrate salt-inducible kinase inhibition as a key modulator of vitamin D metabolism, and provide molecular insight into the coordinated mechanistic actions of PTH, FGF23, and 1,25(OH)2D3 in the kidney that regulate mineral homeostasis.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) comprise the three primary mineralotropic hormones that orchestrate the regulation of mineral homeostasis in higher organisms via the skeleton, kidney, and intestine (1Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Current understanding of the molecular actions of vitamin D.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Google Scholar, 2Pike J.W. Lee S.M. Benkusky N.A. Meyer M.B.

Benkusky N.A. The vitamin D receptor: contemporary genomic approaches reveal new basic and translational insights.J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127: 1146-1154Google Scholar). Each of these hormones functions selectively in specific tissues to regulate the expression of genes whose products control (1) the differentiation and/or maturation of unique cell types, (2) bone formation, mineralization, and resorption, (3) the uptake of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) by the intestine, and (4) internalization and/or secretion of Ca and P in multiple cell types including bone and kidney, all actions that serve to maintain dynamically the circulating levels of extracellular Ca and P. Because of unique and often opposing interactions at genes, each hormone also contributes to the transcriptionally and/or post-transcriptional modulation of the other two, serving either to stimulate or to feedback repress their production as well. Thus, PTH induces the levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces FGF23 and suppresses the levels of PTH secretion, and 1,25(OH)2D3 biosynthesis and FGF23 suppresses PTH and 1,25(OH)2D3, thereby achieving an appropriately exquisite and sensitive integration of mineral regulation by three different hormones (4Shimada T.

During normal physiologic conditions, the synthesis of bioactive endocrine 1,25(OH)2D3 occurs exclusively in the kidney, where it is produced from its precursor substrate 25(OH)D3 and then released into the circulation (7Haussler M.R. Chandler J.S. Pike J.W. Brumbaugh P.F. Speer D.P. Pitt M.J. Physiological importance of vitamin D metabolism.Prog. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 134-142Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 is synthesized by the 25(OH)D3-1α-hydroxylase enzyme, which is encoded by the Cyp27b1 gene, expressed in proximal tubules, its concentration further modified through degradation by the 24-hydroxlase enzyme, which is encoded by the Cyp24a1 gene, both of which contribute to the dynamic physiological control of 1,25(OH)2D3 in the blood (8Brenza H.L.

As stated earlier, the levels of these renal enzymes are modulated through transcriptional control of the expression of both Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 genes, regulation modulated in reciprocal fashion by PTH, FGF23, and 1,25(OH)2D3 (10Meyer M.B.

Chem. 2017; 292: 17541-17558Google Scholar). Indeed, PTH induces Cyp27b1 and suppresses Cyp24a1 expression, whereas both FGF23 and 1,25(OH)2D3 suppress the expression of the former and induce the latter, which is summarized schematically in Figure 1A. General observations that PTH was integral to the regulation of renal Cyp27b1 expression and that 1,25(OH)2D3 was a potent suppressor of this gene were established decades in the past (12Garabedian M. Holick M.F. Deluca H.F. Boyle I.T. Control of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol metabolism by parathyroid glands.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1673-1676Google Scholar, 13Omdahl J.L. Gray R.W.

However, limited progress was made in understanding the mechanisms through which these two hormones as well as FGF23 function to control the expression of these genes until recently. Addressing this issue directly, we focused on the mouse as a model system, thereby overcoming the limitations imposed by experiments in cell culture, and together with improved technical approaches amendable to in vivo studies have provided new molecular insight into how PTH, FGF23, and 1,25(OH)2D3 control the expression of both Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 (10Meyer M.B.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis as a guide, together with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome deletion analysis in vivo to confirm function, we defined the genomic sites of action of each of these mineralotropic hormones across these two gene loci in the kidney (10Meyer M.B.

Chem. 2017; 292: 17541-17558Google Scholar). In summary, we identified four regulatory regions located upstream of the Cyp27b1 gene promoter; one (M1) was located within an intron of the adjacent Mettl1 gene and three (M21 a–c) were collectively located within an extended intron in the more upstream Mettl21b (Eef1akmt3) gene (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the M1 region resulted in highly reduced expression of Cyp27b1, insensitivity to exogenous PTH, and a striking Cyp27b1-null-like phenotype in mice complete with highly elevated PTH, exceptionally low FGF23 levels, and highly compromised circulatory concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 (11Meyer M.B.

Chem. 2017; 292: 17541-17558Google Scholar). Bone loss was also evident. On the other hand, deletion of the M21 region resulted in a reduction in Cyp27b1 expression, but only partial insensitivity to PTH, and was neither accompanied by elevated PTH levels nor changes in circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 and did not display a significant phenotype in the mouse (11Meyer M.B.

These results suggested that M1 represented a unique regulatory region controlled by PTH or that M1 was a hierarchical requirement for the activity of the three M21 regulatory regions. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed the presence of phospho-CREB at each of these four sites. However, determination of a functional association between PTH and CREB could not be established since CREB levels at these sites were unchanged following PTH treatment (10Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A.

We also have reported modest activation of Mettl21b in response to PTH and interaction with these enhancers; however, Mettl21b global deletion did not have a skeletal or mineral phenotype (10Meyer M.B.

Chem. 2019; 294: 9518-9535Google Scholar). Additional regulatory studies revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding at each of these four sites and suppressed Cyp27b1 expression. While FGF23 also suppressed Cyp27b1 expression, the identity of a regulatory factor targeted by FGF23 signaling at the Cyp27b1 gene remains unresolved. Of key importance, this complex regulatory module based upon other parameters was present only in the kidney, providing a molecular basis for the absence of regulated expression of Cyp27b1 in nonrenal tissues by PTH, FGF23, and 1,25(OH)2D3. A summary of these activities is included in Figure 1B. Interestingly, further studies revealed the presence of a similar module that mediated regulatory action by these three hormones in the Cyp24a1 gene (15Meyer M.B. Lee S.M. Carlson A.H. Benkusky N.A.

In summary, while 1,25(OH)2D3 has long been known to regulate expression via a promoter–proximal (PP) element, we discovered an extended region located downstream of the gene that contained multiple regulatory sites that mediated suppression by PTH and induction by both FGF23 and 1,25(OH)2D3 as well (15Meyer M.B.

Deletion analysis in the mouse in vivo confirmed the functionality of these elements and defined two extended segments, a more gene-proximal segment that like Cyp27b1 contained regulatory sites for PTH and FGF23 and bound CREB with a second more distal vitamin D responsive segment; deletion of this more proximal segment resulted in loss of response to both hormones but not to 1,25(OH)2D3, which induced VDR binding to a more distal downstream segment (15Meyer M.B. Lee S.M. Carlson A.H. Benkusky N.A. Kaufmann M. Jones G. et al.A chromatin-based mechanism controls differential regulation of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp24a1 in renal and nonrenal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 14467-14481Google Scholar). Interestingly, like Cyp27b1, the PTH/FGF23-sensitive segment was present only in the kidney, providing a rationale for why in nonrenal tissues, Cyp24a1 is resistant to PTH and FGF23 and not to 1,25(OH)2D3. Further deletion studies in mice, however, suggested that a PP regulatory site located near the Cyp24a1 promoter played a predominant role in 1,25(OH)2D3 regulation in the kidney. The directional nature of Cyp24a1 response to PTH, FGF23, and 1,25(OH)2D3 leads to a corresponding reciprocal change in Cyp27b1 expression and vice versa via homeostatic mechanisms. A summary of these activities is included in Figure 1C. The mechanism of PTH action in bone and kidney involve a triggering of multiple signal transduction pathways including the well-characterized PKA and PKC pathways; the former involving a secondary elevation in cellular cAMP, which leads to a complex G-protein involved signal transduction pathway that results in the activation of several transcription factors (TFs) including CREB at target genes (18Zhang X.

Recent studies have now shown that PTH also modulates salt-inducible kinase (SIK) pathways in bone (20Nishimori S. O'Meara M.J. Castro C.D. Noda H.

Liang Y. Goransson O. Sundberg T.B. Wang J. Williams E.A. et al.SIKs control osteocyte responses to parathyroid hormone.Nat. Commun. 2016; 713176Google Scholar). PTH signaling leads to PKA-mediated SIK phosphorylation, a modification that inhibits cellular SIK activity via an allosteric mechanism. SIKs are widely expressed in numerous tissues including the kidney; PKA-dependent SIK inhibition causes the dephosphorylation-dependent cytoplasmic release of CREB-regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs/TORCs) and their subsequent translocation into the nucleus (23Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G.

There, they interact directly with DNA-bound CREB and/or several other TFs and contribute along with CBP (CREB-binding protein)/p300, an additional CREB coactivator, to regulate gene expression. Recent investigations of the PTH-induced SIK pathway in bone has taken advantage of several pharmacologic SIK inhibitors such as YKL-05-099 and, more recently, SK-124 that cause the release of cytoplasmic CRTCs into the nucleus where they regulate the expression of specific PTH-sensitive genes that are involved in bone formation (22Wein M.N.

Considerable insight has been gained regarding the molecular properties of both CBP and the CRTCs. CBP is a large multidomain-containing coregulator with multiple protein–protein interaction domains that may also facilitate chromatin reorganization as well as residual acetyltransferase activity at histone H3K27 (H3K27ac) (28Van de Velde S. Wiater E. Tran M. Hwang Y. Cole P.A. Montminy M. CREB promotes beta cell gene expression by targeting its coactivators to tissue-specific enhancers.Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 39e00200-19Google Scholar, 29Goodman R.H. Smolik S. CBP/p300 in cell growth, transformation, and development.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Google Scholar). The CRTCs, on the other hand, interact directly with CREB and potentially with specific DNA sequences but are not known to retain histone acetyltransferase activity (24Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Screaton R. Guzman E. Miraglia L. Hogenesch J.B. et al.TORCs: transducers of regulated CREB activity.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 413-423Google Scholar). Although they are believed to stabilize DNA-bound CREB, likely additional roles in gene regulation for the CRTCs are not fully understood. In the present report, we assess the impact of PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3, and FGF23 on hormone-regulated events that culminate in changes in the expression of Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 in the kidney. Importantly, we have focused this current report on only Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 despite the genome-wide datasets for all factors we have examined. A detailed genome-wide analysis will follow this article. We examine the temporal aspects of PTH induction and find these activities occur on a far more rapid timescale than we previously believed. These activities are accompanied by coactivator recruitment for activation (Cyp27b1) or coactivator withdrawal for suppression (Cyp24a1). Interestingly, direct pharmacologic SIK inhibition is able to induce CRTC2 coactivator recruitment; however, the overall activities are muted in comparison to PTH. There is limited overlap between these activities and the reciprocal 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23 suppression of Cyp27b1 and activation of Cyp24a1. In both cases, these activities manifest themselves by direct changes to the factors responsible for transcription like RNA polymerase II (pol II) and many histone markers of activation. We suggest that multiple CREB modules together with alterations in CREB coactivators at these sites in both Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 genes drive appropriate selective reciprocal responses to PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3, and FGF23 regulation in vivo. PTH rapidly induces the expression of Cyp27b1 in the kidney (Fig. 2A). Our previous studies revealed the presence of four regulatory units within intronic sequences in two genes located upstream of the Cyp27b1 promoter (CP) that were occupied by phosphorylated (p-133) CREB (pCREB) (10Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A. Kaufmann M. Lee S.M. Redfield R.R.

Chem. 2017; 292: 17541-17558Google Scholar). We could not, however, confirm a potential relationship on the genome between PTH and pCREB because the recruitment of this factor was unaffected by hormone treatment at the chosen time point (1 h). An increase in histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) density was clearly evident at each of these four sites in the earlier study; however, indicating an increased activity of the locus in response to PTH (10Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A. Kaufmann M. Lee S.M. Redfield R.R.

Chem. 2017; 292: 17541-17558Google Scholar). Given the rapidity with which known exogenous PTH induces Cyp27b1 gene expression, we initiated these current studies by conducting an abbreviated time course of response using ChIP-Seq analysis. For these studies, we will focus on results around Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 only, an article dedicated to the genome-wide analysis of these cofactors is in preparation. We injected mice with PTH and harvested the kidneys for ChIP and ChIP-Seq analysis after 0 (Veh), 15, 30, and 60 min to investigate this rapid action and then examined this genomic profile around the Cyp27b1 locus with special focus on the previously identified kidney-specific enhancers M1 and M21 (a–c) for Cyp27b1, as well as near the CP (10Meyer M.B.

Chem. 2017; 292: 17541-17558Google Scholar). We have also highlighted the Mettl1/Mettl21b promoter regions for comparison as these promoters are not kidney specific and are occupied in many other tissues of the mouse. We have displayed the vehicle as a stand-alone track for each track set. Each treatment condition (blue) listed is compared with an overlaid track against that vehicle track. Those regions where the treatment is greater than the vehicle (increase of occupancy), the track appears blue. Those where the treatment is less than the vehicle (loss of occupancy), yellow is displayed. Occupancies that overlap (treatment and vehicle) appear as green. We then performed statistics on the biological triplicate ChIP-Seq track read densities for each peak region and displayed them as fold change (FC) versus vehicle to the right of each track set. These FCs can be illuminating; however, one important caveat to the calculations based on sequencing read density is that there is no cutoff for minimal read density. Thus, extremely minor increases from an origin of low reads may appear as an appreciable increase by FC calculations. The unabbreviated values including the raw read density values are included in Table S1 and should be considered when evaluating each figure and data track. It is also important to note that 0 h (Veh) samples represent a mouse at “homeostasis,” that is this animal has normal and physiologic circulating levels of PTH (and many other hormones such as 1,25(OH)2D3 and intact FGF23 [iFGF23]). The outcome of this is genomic occupancy for TFs, coactivators, and histone modifications at a homeostatic state prior to hormone injection, which appear in our figures in the yellow tracks. As can be seen in Figure 2B, PTH exerted a significant upregulation of pCREB abundance at each site across the two Cyp27b1 regulatory submodules beginning as early as 15 m that peaked at 30 m and returned to below baseline by 1 h, the time point taken in the previous experiments. For example, the raw read counts at M1 were ∼57 that peaked maximally at ∼400 reads for PTH treatment for 30 min (Table S1). pCREB had very little binding to the CP at any time point (raw read values of ∼4 basally increased to ∼16, Table S1), consistent with our previous studies (10Meyer M.B.

This study aimed to analyze the genome sequence of Lp. plantarum PMO 08 and identify its safety and probiotic characteristics at the genomic level. For this, complete genome sequencing was conducted to investigate the genes associated with risk and probiotic characteristics by using Pacbio combined with Illumina HiSeq. This bacterial strain has one circular chromosome of 3,247,789 bp with 44.5% G + C content and two plasmids of 50,296 bp with 39.0% G + C content and 19,592 bp with 40.5% G + C content. Orthologous average nucleotide identity analysis showed that PMO 08 belongs to the Lp. plantarum group with 99.14% similarity to Lp. plantarum WCFS1. No deleterious genes were determined in the virulence factor analysis, and no hemolysin activity or secondary bile salt synthesis were detected in vitro test. In the case of antibiotic resistance analysis, PMO 08 was resistant to ampicillin in vitro test, but these genes were not transferable. In addition, the strain showed same carbohydrate utilization with Lp. plantarum WCFS1, except for mannopyranoside, which only our strain can metabolize. The strain also harbors a gene for inositol monophosphatase family protein related with phytate hydrolysis and have several genes for metabolizing various carbohydrate which were rich in plant environment. Furthermore, in probiotic characteristics several genes involved in phenotypes such as acid/bile tolerance, adhesion ability, and oxidative stress response were detected in genome analysis. This study demonstrates that Lp. plantarum PMO 08 harbors several probiotic-related genes (with no deleterious genes) and is a suitable probiotic starter for plant-based fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W4299805930,"Abstract The solute carrier 26 family member A9 (SLC26A9) is an epithelial anion transporter that is assumed to contribute to airway chloride secretion and surface hydration. Whether SLC26A9 or CFTR is responsible for airway Cl − transport under basal conditions is still unclear, due to the lack of a specific inhibitor for SLC26A9. In the present study, we report a novel potent and specific inhibitor for SLC26A9, identified by screening of a drug‐like molecule library and subsequent chemical modifications. The most potent compound S9‐A13 inhibited SLC26A9 with an IC 50 of 90.9 ± 13.4 nM. S9‐A13 did not inhibit other members of the SLC26 family and had no effects on Cl − channels such as CFTR, TMEM16A, or VRAC. S9‐A13 inhibited SLC26A9 Cl − currents in cells that lack expression of CFTR. It also inhibited proton secretion by HGT‐1 human gastric cells. In contrast, S9‐A13 had minimal effects on ion transport in human airway epithelia and mouse trachea, despite clear expression of SLC26A9 in the apical membrane of ciliated cells. In both tissues, basal and stimulated Cl − secretion was due to CFTR, while acidification of airway surface liquid by S9‐A13 suggests a role of SLC26A9 for airway bicarbonate secretion."
https://openalex.org/W4298009608,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal chemical modification of mRNAs involved in many pathological processes including various cancers. In this study, we investigated the m6A-dependent regulation of JUN and JUNB transcription factors (TFs) during transforming growth factor-beta–induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of A549 and LC2/ad lung cancer cell lines, as the function and regulation of these TFs within this process remains to be clarified. We found that JUN and JUNB played an important and nonredundant role in the EMT-inducing gene expression program by regulating different mesenchymal genes and that their expressions were controlled by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) m6A methyltransferase. METTL3–mediated regulation of JUN expression is associated with the translation process of JUN protein but not with the stability of JUN protein or mRNA, which is in contrast with the result of m6A-mediated regulation of JUNB mRNA stability. We identified the specific m6A motifs responsible for the regulation of JUN and JUNB in EMT within 3′UTR of JUN and JUNB.

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the crucial mechanisms causing cancer malignancies, such as invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy (1Dongre A. Weinberg R.A.

Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 2Pastushenko I. Blanpain C. EMT transition states during tumor progression and metastasis.Trends Cell Biol. 2019; 29: 212-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). During EMT, tumor cells lose epithelial characters such as cell polarity and cell contacts and acquire invasive stem cell–like properties that expand their ability for local invasion and metastasis. A major inducer of EMT is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) along with the cytokines and growth factors secreted by the tumor microenvironment. EMT is characterized by the dynamic and reversible changes in epithelial and mesenchymal gene expression (3Lamouille S. Xu J. Derynck R. Molecular mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 178-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). Epithelial cell markers such as E-cadherin and claudins are downregulated, whereas mesenchymal markers including vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin are upregulated during EMT. Many transcription factors (TFs) are involved in the transcriptional regulation of EMT-related genes. Especially, TFs such as ZEB family, SNAIL family, and TWIST can activate EMT through the transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. Recently, nonredundant functions of EMT-related TFs have been emphasized (4Stemmler M.P. Eccles R.L. Brabletz S. Brabletz T. Non-redundant functions of EMT transcription factors.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Because of the differential expression patterns in different tumor types, EMT-related TFs would have different functions and different target genes in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, careful analyses and discussions are important to understand their roles in various cancers. In addition, epigenetic regulations are considered as one of the critical mechanisms for EMT owing to its phenotypic plasticity (5Tam W.L. Weinberg R.A. The epigenetics of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in cancer.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 6Serrano-Gomez S.J. Maziveyi M. Alahari S.K.

Thus, we have investigated and found the essential roles of histone methylation, histone ubiquitination, and long noncoding RNAs in the transcriptional regulatory network during EMT (7Oktyabri D.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal chemical modification of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in eukaryotes and is implicated in alternative polyadenylation, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, and translation efficiency (11Zaccara S. Ries R.J. Jaffrey S.R. Reading, writing and erasing mRNA methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This modification is controlled by a series of proteins identified as “Writer,” “Eraser,” and “Reader.” Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), METTL14, WTAP, and RBM15 constitute the m6A methyltransferase complex, “Writer,” to catalyze m6A methylation. On the other hand, FTO and ALKBH5 function as “Eraser” to remove the N-methyl of m6A site, which maintains a dynamic nature of this modification (12Shi H. Wei J. He C. Where, when, and how: context-dependent functions of RNA methylation writers, readers, and erasers.Mol. Cell. 2019; 74: 640-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). “Reader” includes the YTHDF family, IGF2BP family, and YTHDC family to transmit the modification signal. It is emerging that m6A modification plays an important role in diverse biological processes, including development, metabolism, stemness maintenance, and differentiation (13He P.C. He C. m(6) A RNA methylation: from mechanisms to therapeutic potential.EMBO J. 2021; 40e105977Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also revealed that m6A regulation is involved in the development and progression of various types of cancer (14Lan Q. Liu P.Y. Haase J. Bell J.L. Huttelmaier S. Liu T.

It has been demonstrated that JUN family of TFs, JUN, JUNB, and JUND, are activated by various external stimuli and are involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (16Shaulian E. Karin M. AP-1 in cell proliferation and survival.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). In particular, with respect to EMT regulation, it was reported that silencing of JUN enhanced E-cadherin expression and repressed N-cadherin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (17Lin G. Yu B. Liang Z. Li L. Qu S. Chen K. et al.Silencing of c-jun decreases cell migration, invasion, and EMT in radioresistant human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-2R.Onco Targets Ther. 2018; 11: 3805-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and suppressed SNAI2 expression in breast cancer cells (18Chen H.

Pan Z.K. et al.Extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway regulates breast cancer cell migration by maintaining slug expression.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 9228-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). During transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)–induced EMT in mouse mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG, JUNB controls the induction of profibrotic factors such as fibronectin and tropomyosin, which are essential for cell–matrix adhesion and actin stress fiber formation (19Gervasi M. Bianchi-Smiraglia A. Cummings M. Zheng Q. Wang D. Liu S. et al.JunB contributes to Id2 repression and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in response to transforming growth factor-beta.J.

JUND was shown to be involved in arecoline-induced EMT of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma through the downregulation of ZO-1 (20Ghosh S. Talukdar P.D. Bhattacharjee A. Giri S.

These studies suggested that the involvement of each JUN family member in EMT and the target genes it controls might be different in various cancer types. Previously, we have shown that JUNB is one of the important TFs regulated by METTL3 m6A methyltransferase during TGF-β-induced EMT of A549 and LC2/ad lung cancer cell lines (21Wanna-Udom S. Terashima M. Lyu H. Ishimura A. Takino T. Sakari M. et al.The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 contributes to Transforming Growth Factor-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung cancer cells through the regulation of JUNB.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 524: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). METTL3 influences the stability of JUNB mRNA through m6A methylation. However, the function of each JUN family member and its regulation by m6A modification during TGF-β-induced EMT in lung cancer cells are still largely unknown. In this study, we tried to elucidate the function and regulatory mechanism of JUN family TFs in the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes during TGF-β-induced EMT of lung cancer cell. Our data indicated that JUN and JUNB but not JUND contributed to the EMT-inducing gene expression program by regulating different mesenchymal marker genes. We also found that m6A RNA modification by METTL3 regulated the expression of JUN at the protein level but controlled JUNB expression at the RNA level during EMT, which was mediated by the different m6A reader proteins. To validate the involvement of JUN family TFs in TGF-β-induced EMT of lung cancer cells, we first examined the changes in expression of JUN, JUNB, and JUND by TGF-β treatment (Figs. 1, A and B and S1). Quantitative RT–PCR (QRT–PCR) revealed that the expressions of JUN and JUNB but not of JUND mRNA were increased by TGF-β in A549 (Fig. 1A) and LC2/ad (Fig. S1A) lung cancer cell lines. We also detected TGF-β-dependent increase of endogenous JUN and JUNB but not of JUND protein in A549 (Fig. 1B) and LC2/ad (Fig. S1B) cells by immunoblotting. These results suggested the possible involvement of JUN and JUNB TFs in TGF-β-induced EMT process. Next, we examined the knockdown effects of JUN family members in A549 and LC2/ad cells to clarify their functions in EMT process. We used two different shRNAs (shRNA#1 and #2) for each gene and confirmed that the two shRNAs similarly decreased the expression of the target gene in both cells by QRT–PCR (Fig. S2). During EMT, epithelial cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype by downregulating an epithelial cell marker, CDH1, and upregulating mesenchymal cell markers such as VIM, FN1, and CDH2 (3Lamouille S. Xu J. Derynck R. Molecular mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 178-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). We analyzed the expression levels of them by QRT–PCR (Figs. 1, C–E, S3, and S4). The two shRNAs for each gene caused similar effects in the expression of EMT-related genes in both cells (Figs. S3 and S4), and therefore, the data of shRNA#1 in A549 cells were shown as the representative results in the main figures (Fig. 1, C–E). Knockdown of JUN and JUNB significantly increased the expression of an epithelial marker gene, CDH1, in the absence of TGF-β, and partly inhibited its transcriptional repression mediated by TGF-β in A549 and LC2/ad cells (Figs. 1, C, D, S4, A and B). This result strongly suggested the important contribution of JUN and JUNB TFs to the transcriptional regulation during EMT of lung cancer cells. Among the mesenchymal marker genes, JUN and JUNB knockdown had no influence on the expression of VIM gene without TGF-β but slightly prevented TGF-β-dependent increase of its expression in both cells (Figs. 1, C, D, S4, A and B). For FN1 gene, knockdown of JUNB but not of JUN significantly reduced its expression level in the presence or the absence of TGF-β in A549 cells (Fig. 1, C and D), although FN1 expression was too low to be analyzed in LC2/ad cells. On the contrary, knockdown of JUN but not of JUNB decreased the expression of CDH2 in both cells (Figs. 1, C, D, S4, A, and B), indicating the different functions of JUN and JUNB TFs in the regulation of mesenchymal marker genes. In contrast, knockdown of JUND did not show any significant effects on the expression of these EMT-related genes (Figs. S1E and S4C), indicating little contribution of JUND TF to EMT of lung cancer cells. We also examined these inhibitory effects of JUN or JUNB knockdown on the protein expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin during TGF-β-induced EMT of A549 and LC2/ad cells (Figs. 1, F, G, S5, A and B). Efficient downregulation of JUN or JUNB protein slightly increased E-cadherin expression and significantly inhibited its TGF-β-mediated reduction. We could confirm that JUNB knockdown reduced the TGF-β-dependent increase of fibronectin (Fig. 1G), whereas JUN knockdown inhibited the N-cadherin induction by TGF-β (Figs. 1F and S5A). These results indicated that JUN and JUNB TFs controlled the expression of common or specific EMT-related target genes and played a crucial role in TGF-β-induced EMT of A549 and LC2/ad lung cancer cell lines. Previously, we have demonstrated that JUNB is one of the important TFs regulated by METTL3 m6A methyltransferase during TGF-β-induced EMT process (21Wanna-Udom S. Terashima M. Lyu H. Ishimura A. Takino T. Sakari M. et al.The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 contributes to Transforming Growth Factor-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung cancer cells through the regulation of JUNB.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 524: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding triggered us to investigate whether JUN was controlled by METTL3 in A549 and LC2/ad cells. We examined the m6A methylation level of JUN mRNA by m6A RNA immunoprecipitation (m6A RIP) assay. The m6A-modified JUN mRNA was increased by TGF-β treatment in A549 and LC2/ad lung cancer cells (Figs. 2A and S6A). METTL3 knockdown decreased the m6A methylation of JUN mRNA in the absence of TGF-β and cancelled the TGF-β effect on the increase of m6A level (Fig. 2A and S6A). Since METTL3 has been shown indispensable for TGF-β-induced EMT (21Wanna-Udom S. Terashima M. Lyu H. Ishimura A. Takino T. Sakari M. et al.The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 contributes to Transforming Growth Factor-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung cancer cells through the regulation of JUNB.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 524: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), m6A methylation of JUN mRNA was suggested to play an important regulatory role in EMT. We also found that METTL3 knockdown reduced the protein level of JUN in both cells and cancelled the TGF-β-mediated induction of JUN protein (Figs. 2B and S6B). Interestingly, METTL3 knockdown had no effect on JUN mRNA expression in the absence of TGF-β and decreased TGF-β-dependent induction only slightly (Figs. 2C and S6C). Therefore, the reduction of JUN protein by METTL3 knockdown could not be explained by the mRNA expression level. These results indicated that METTL3-mediated m6A methylation influenced the expression of JUN protein but not of JUN mRNA. This is in contrast with the case of m6A-dependent regulation of JUNB, since a decrease in JUNB mRNA was clearly detected by METTL3 knockdown (21Wanna-Udom S. Terashima M. Lyu H. Ishimura A. Takino T. Sakari M. et al.The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 contributes to Transforming Growth Factor-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung cancer cells through the regulation of JUNB.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 524: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Then, we hypothesized that the reduction of JUN protein in the METTL3 knockdown cells might be due to the difference in protein stability or translational regulation. To examine the stability of JUN protein, the control and METTL3 knockdown cells were treated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. Then immunoblotting was performed at the indicated period after treatment in A549 and LC2/ad cells (Figs. 2D and S6D). Quantitative analysis of the band intensities revealed that the expression of JUN protein was similarly decreased in the control and METTL3 knockdown cells (Figs. 2E and S6E), indicating that protein stability of JUN was not influenced by METTL3-dependent m6A regulation. These results together suggested that the m6A-mediated expression of JUN protein was related to the regulation of translation process rather than the mRNA regulation and protein stability. In the previous study, we reported that the stability of JUNB mRNA was regulated through m6A methylation by METTL3 during EMT process (21Wanna-Udom S. Terashima M. Lyu H. Ishimura A. Takino T. Sakari M. et al.The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 contributes to Transforming Growth Factor-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of lung cancer cells through the regulation of JUNB.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 524: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism, we tried to determine which region of JUNB was responsible for the m6A-dependent regulation. We constructed dual luciferase reporter plasmids containing a Firefly luciferase followed by 5′UTR, coding sequence (CDS), or 3′UTR of JUNB (Fig. 3A) and an internal control Renilla luciferase. These plasmids were transfected into the control and METTL3 knockdown A549 cells, and luciferase activity and the expression of luciferase mRNA were analyzed. Among the three types of reporter plasmids, the plasmid containing JUNB 3′UTR only showed reduced luciferase activity in the METTL3 knockdown cells than in the control cells (Fig. 3B). QRT–PCR revealed a similar decrease of luciferase mRNA only for the reporter with JUNB 3′UTR (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that 3′UTR of JUNB contained the responsible region for mRNA regulation by METTL3 enzyme. According to the database of m6A methylation sites (ConsRM) (22Song B. Chen K. Tang Y. Wei Z. Su J. de Magalhaes J.P. et al.ConsRM: collection and large-scale prediction of the evolutionarily conserved RNA methylation sites, with implications for the functional epitranscriptome.Brief Bioinform. 2021; 22bbab088Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), there are four potential m6A methylation motifs (m6A_1–4) within 3′UTR of JUNB complementary DNA (cDNA) in A549 cells (Fig. 3A). We designed the three sets of PCR primers to amplify the fragments containing these m6A sites and performed m6A RNA-IP for fragmented RNA isolated from the control and METTL3 knockdown A549 cells with or without TGF-β (Fig. 3D). QRT–PCR revealed that all amplified regions (JUNB_RIP1, 2, and 3) showed a significant increase of m6A level in the presence of TGF-β. The RIP1 and RIP2 but not RIP3 amplicons detected a reduction of m6A level in the METTL3 knockdown cells (Fig. 3D). This result strongly suggested that the RIP1 and RIP2 regions of JUNB 3′UTR contained the m6A sites controlled by METTL3. Since there are three potential m6A sites (m6A_1–3) within the RIP1 and RIP2 regions, we generated the luciferase reporter plasmids for each m6A site mutant (m1, m2, and m3) and the combined mutants (Fig. 3A). These plasmids were transfected into the control and METTL3 knockdown A549 cells, and luciferase activity and mRNA expression were analyzed. The m1 and m2 mutants of m6A sites resulted in a significant decrease of luciferase activity and mRNA expression in the control cells, and the combined mutant (m1m2) showed further reduction (Fig. 3, E and F). However, the m3 mutant showed no difference in luciferase activity and mRNA, and the m3 mutation did not cause any further effects even when it was combined with others (Fig. 3, E and F). Notably, the decrease of luciferase activity and mRNA by the m1 and m2 mutants was not detected in the METTL3 knockdown cells (Fig. 3, E and F), indicating the requirement of METTL3 enzyme in the regulation through the m6A sites. These results suggested that the m6A_1 and m6A_2 sites of JUNB 3′UTR were the target sites of METTL3 for the regulation of JUNB mRNA. Next, we confirmed the results obtained from the luciferase reporter constructs in a different way. We constructed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged JUNB expression plasmids containing 5′UTR-CDS, only CDS, or CDS-3′UTR (Fig. 3A) and transfected them into the control and METTL3 knockdown A549 cells. The Renilla luciferase plasmid was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Immunoblotting and QRT–PCR analysis revealed that the construct containing JUNB CDS-3′UTR only showed a remarkable decrease of JUNB protein (Fig. 3G) and mRNA (Fig. 3H) in the METTL3 knockdown cells, indicating the importance of 3′UTR in METTL3-mediated regulation. Then we used JUNB CDS-3′UTR expression plasmids for wildtype and the selected m6A site mutants (m3, m1m2, and m1m2m3) in the similar experiment. We confirmed that the m1 and m2 mutations caused a reduction of JUNB protein and mRNA, but the m3 mutation had no effect in the control cells (Fig. 3, I and J). Again, this m6A site–dependent regulation of JUNB expression was not observed in the METTL3 knockdown cells (Fig. 3, I and J). Taken together, we concluded that the m6A_1 and m6A_2 sites of JUNB 3′UTR were responsible for m6A-mediated regulation of JUNB mRNA in A549 lung cancer cells. We next tried to determine which region of JUN mRNA was involved in the regulation of protein expression by METTL3 enzyme. We constructed luciferase reporter plasmids containing 5′UTR, CDS, or 3′UTR of JUN (Fig. 4A) and examined the luciferase activities in the control and METTL3 knockdown A549 cells. However, we did not detect any significant differences (Fig. 4B). Then we utilized HA-tagged JUN expression plasmids containing 5′UTR-CDS-3′UTR, 5′UTR-CDS, only CDS, or CDS-3′UTR (Fig. 4A) to compare the expression levels between the control and METTL3 knockdown cells. As shown in Figure 4C, the plasmids containing 5′UTR-CDS-3′UTR and CDS-3′UTR but not others revealed decreased expression of JUN protein in the METTL3 knockdown cells. QRT–PCR showed no significant differences of JUN mRNA for all the constructs (Fig. 4D). This result was consistent with the finding that JUN expression was controlled by METTL3 at the protein level (Fig. 2). These results indicated that 3′UTR of JUN contained the region critical for the regulation by METTL3 enzyme. The database of m6A methylation sites (22Song B. Chen K. Tang Y. Wei Z. Su J. de Magalhaes J.P. et al.ConsRM: collection and large-scale prediction of the evolutionarily conserved RNA methylation sites, with implications for the functional epitranscriptome.Brief Bioinform. 2021; 22bbab088Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) revealed seven potential m6A motifs (m6A_1–7) within 3′UTR of JUN cDNA in A549 cells (Fig. 4A). We designed the four PCR primer pairs (JUN_RIP1 to 4) to cover these m6A sites and performed m6A RNA-IP for fragmented RNA isolated from the indicated cells (Fig. 4E). QRT–PCR indicated that the JUN_RIP1 and RIP2 amplicons but not others showed a remarkable increase of m6A level by TGF-β and a significant decrease of m6A in the METTL3 knockdown cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that these regions contained the target m6A sites. We found three potential m6A sites (m6A_1–3) within the RIP1 and RIP2 regions and constructed JUN CDS-3′UTR expression plasmids for wildtype, each m6A site mutant (m1, m2, and m3) and the combined mutants (Fig. 4A). Immunoblotting showed that combination of m1 and m3 mutations resulted in an obvious reduction of JUN protein in the control cells (Fig. 4F). The effect of either m1 mutation or m3 mutation seemed marginal, but the m2 mutation did not cause any effects by itself or combined (Fig. 4F). We confirmed that these m6A mutations did not induce any significant differences in the expression of JUN mRNA (Fig. 4G). The m6A site–dependent regulation of JUN protein was not observed in the METTL3 knockdown cells (Fig. 4, F and G), indicating the requirement of METTL3 in the regulation through the m6A sites. Taken together, we concluded that the m6A_1 and m6A_3 sites of JUN 3′UTR were responsible for METTL3-mediated regulation of JUN protein expression in A549 lung cancer cells. Our results indicated that METTL3 controlled the expression of JUNB at the mRNA level but controlled JUN expression at the protein level. We hypothesized that different m6A reader proteins might be involved in the m6A-mediated regulation of JUN and JUNB. To find the candidate m6A reader proteins for JUN and JUNB, we examined the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of each m6A reader on the expression of JUN and JUNB proteins in A549 lung cancer cells (Fig. 5A). Efficient knockdown of eight representative m6A readers (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, IGF2BP3, YTHDC1, and YTHDC2) by the corresponding shRNA was confirmed by QRT–PCR and immunoblotting (Fig. S7, A and B). We performed immunoblotting to detect JUN and JUNB proteins in each m6A reader knockdown cells and compared the band intensities with those in the control (negative control) and METTL3 knockdown (positive control) cells. The results showed that JUN protein was remarkably downregulated in YTHDF3 knockdown cells, and JUNB protein was decreased with IGF2BP1 knockdown (Fig. 5A). We decided to pick up YTHDF3 and IGF2BP1 as the candidate m6A reader proteins for JUN and JUNB, respectively. To validate the involvement of YTHDF3 and IGF2BP1 in the regulation of JUN and JUNB expression, we confirmed the knockdown effects in protein and mRNA expression in A549 and LC2/ad lung cancer cells with or without TGF-β treatment. We found that YTHDF3 knockdown reduced the protein level of JUN in A549 (Fig. 5B) and LC2/ad cells (Fig. S8A) and almost canceled the TGF-β-dependent induction of JUN protein. Interestingly, YTHDF3 knockdown had no effect on JUN mRNA expression in the presence or the absence of TGF-β (Figs. 5C and S8B). In contrast, IGF2BP1 knockdown decreased the expression and induction of JUNB protein and mRNA in A549 (Fig. 5, D and E) and LC2/ad (Fig. S8, C and D) cells. These results are consistent with the aforementioned results for the m6A-dependent regulation of JUN protein and JUNB mRNA. To detect the interaction between the m6A reader proteins and JUN or JUNB mRNA, we performed RIP–QRT–PCR analysis. The control or METTL3 knockdown A549 cells were infected with retroviruses expressing FLAG-tagged YTHDF3, and the crosslinked cell lysates were prepared in the presence of TGF-β. RIP was performed with normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) or anti-FLAG antibody, and the coprecipitated RNA was analyzed by QRT–PCR with JUN_RIP1 primers (Fig. 5F). The interaction of FLAG-YTHDF3 protein and JUN mRNA was clearly detected in the control cells with YTHDF3 overexpression, but this enrichment was significantly reduced in the METTL3 knockdown cells (Fig. 5F). Similar RIP–QRT–PCR experiments were carried out using FLAG-IGF2BP1 overexpression and JUNB_RIP1 prime"

Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is derived from ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and is involved in the resolution phase of chronic inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to decipher the protective role of RvD1 via formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) receptor signaling in attenuating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The elastase-treatment model of AAA in C57BL/6 (WT) mice and human AAA tissue was used to confirm our hypotheses. Elastase-treated FPR2-/- mice had a significant increase in aortic diameter, proinflammatory cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (macrophages and neutrophils), elastic fiber disruption, and decrease in smooth muscle cell α-actin expression compared to elastase-treated WT mice. RvD1 treatment attenuated AAA formation, aortic inflammation, and vascular remodeling in WT mice, but not in FPR2-/- mice. Importantly, human AAA tissue demonstrated significantly decreased FPR2 mRNA expression compared to non-aneurysm human aortas. Mechanistically, RvD1/FPR2 signaling mitigated p47phox phosphorylation and prevented hallmarks of ferroptosis, such as lipid peroxidation and Nrf2 translocation, thereby attenuating HMGB1 secretion. Collectively, this study demonstrates RvD1-mediated immunomodulation of FPR2 signaling on macrophages to mitigate ferroptosis and HMGB1 release, leading to resolution of aortic inflammation and remodeling during AAA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4300687958,"Cellular senescence is the irreversible arrest of normally dividing cells and is driven by the cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a, and Trp53. Senescent cells are implicated in chronic diseases and tissue repair through their increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here, we use spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to demonstrate that cells displaying senescent characteristics are ""transiently"" present within regenerating skeletal muscle and within the muscles of D2-mdx mice, a model of Muscular Dystrophy. Following injury, multiple cell types including macrophages and fibrog-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) upregulate senescent features such as senescence pathway genes, SASP factors, and senescence-associated beta-gal (SA-β-gal) activity. Importantly, when these cells were removed with ABT-263, a senolytic compound, satellite cells are reduced, and muscle fibers were impaired in growth and myonuclear accretion. These results highlight that an ""acute"" senescent phenotype facilitates regeneration similar to skin and neonatal myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W4300690208,"Cholesteatoma is a progressive middle ear disease that can only be treated surgically but with a high recurrence rate. Depending on the extent of the disease, a surgical approach, such as microsurgery with a retroarticular incision or transcanal endoscopic surgery, is performed. However, the current examination cannot sufficiently predict the progression before surgery, and changes in approach may be made during the surgery. Large amounts of data are typically required to train deep neural network models; however, the prevalence of cholesteatomas is low (1-in-25, 000). Developing analysis methods that improve the accuracy with such a small number of samples is an important issue for medical artificial intelligence (AI) research. This paper presents an AI-based system to automatically detect mastoid extensions using CT. This retrospective study included 164 patients (80 with mastoid extension and 84 without mastoid extension) who underwent surgery. This study adopted a relatively lightweight neural network model called MobileNetV2 to learn and predict the CT images of 164 patients. The training was performed with eight divided groups for cross-validation and was performed 24 times with each of the eight groups to verify accuracy fluctuations caused by randomly augmented learning. An evaluation was performed by each of the 24 single-trained models, and 24 sets of ensemble predictions with 23 models for 100% original size images and 400% zoomed images. Fifteen otolaryngologists diagnosed the images and compared the results. The average accuracy of predicting 400% zoomed images using ensemble prediction model was 81.14% (sensitivity = 84.95%, specificity = 77.33%). The average accuracy of the otolaryngologists was 73.41% (sensitivity, 83.17%; specificity, 64.13%), which was not affected by their clinical experiences. Noteworthily, despite the small number of cases, we were able to create a highly accurate AI. These findings represent an important first step in the automatic diagnosis of the cholesteatoma extension."
https://openalex.org/W4297984477,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a molecular machine that Gram-negative bacteria have adapted for multiple functions, including interbacterial competition. Bacteria use the T6SS to deliver protein effectors into adjacent cells to kill rivals and establish niche dominance. Central to T6SS-mediated bacterial competition is an arms race to acquire diverse effectors to attack and neutralize target cells. The peptidoglycan has a central role in bacterial cell physiology, and effectors that biochemically modify peptidoglycan structure effectively induce cell death. One such T6SS effector is Tlde1a from Salmonella Typhimurium. Tlde1a functions as an LD-carboxypeptidase to cleave tetrapeptide stems and as an LD-transpeptidase to exchange the terminal D-alanine of a tetrapeptide stem with a noncanonical D-amino acid. To understand how Tlde1a exhibits toxicity at the molecular level, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of Tlde1a alone and in complex with D-amino acids. Our structural data revealed that Tlde1a possesses a unique LD-transpeptidase fold consisting of a dual pocket active site with a capping subdomain. This includes an exchange pocket to bind a D-amino acid for exchange and a catalytic pocket to position the D-alanine of a tetrapeptide stem for cleavage. Our toxicity assays in Escherichia coli and in vitro peptidoglycan biochemical assays with Tlde1a variants correlate Tlde1a molecular features directly to its biochemical functions. We observe that the LD-carboxypeptidase and LD-transpeptidase activities of Tlde1a are both structurally and functionally linked. Overall, our data highlight how an LD-transpeptidase fold has been structurally altered to create a toxic effector in the T6SS arms race.

Revisiting the steps of Salmonella gut infection with a focus on antagonistic interbacterial interactions.FEBS J. 2021; 289: 4192-4211Google Scholar). At the molecular level, the T6SS forcibly secretes toxic protein effectors directly into adjacent cells in a contact-dependent manner (1Basler M. Ho B.T. Mekalanos J.J. Tit-for-tat: type VI secretion system counterattack during bacterial cell-cell interactions.Cell. 2013; 152: 884-894Google Scholar, 3Russell A.B. Hood R.D. Bui N.K. LeRoux M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D.

The T6SS is structurally similar to the T4 phage tail apparatus and is organized into three main complexes: the transmembrane, the baseplate, and the tail complex (17Nguyen V.S. Douzi B. Durand E. Roussel A. Cascales E. Cambillau C. Towards a complete structural deciphering of Type VI secretion system.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2018; 49: 77-84Google Scholar). The transmembrane complex spans the periplasm anchoring the T6SS to the bacterial envelope and allows consequent docking of the baseplate (22Durand E. Nguyen V.S. Zoued A. Logger L. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Aschtgen M.S. et al.Biogenesis and structure of a type VI secretion membrane core complex.Nature. 2015; 523: 555-560Google Scholar). The baseplate serves to link the tail complex to the transmembrane complex, while also providing an environment for effector loading onto the tip of the tail complex (17Nguyen V.S. Douzi B. Durand E.

The tail complex is comprised of haemolysin coregulated protein (Hcp) hexamers enveloped in a dynamic protein sheath, which together span the bacterial cell before firing (17Nguyen V.S. Douzi B.

Journet L. Cascales E. In vivo TssA proximity labelling during type VI secretion biogenesis reveals TagA as a protein that stops and holds the sheath.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 1304-1313Google Scholar). Within the baseplate at the tip of the tail complex, a valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) binds directly to the Hcp proteins of the tail (26Renault M.G. Zamarreno Beas J. Douzi B. Chabalier M. Zoued A. Brunet Y.R. et al.The gp27-like hub of VgrG serves as adaptor to promote Hcp tube Assembly.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430: 3143-3156Google Scholar). Depending upon the biological role of a particular T6SS, the individual effectors may bind directly to the VgrG spike protein or the Hcp proteins of the tail for secretion (27Ho B.T. Dong T.G.

Additionally, the mechanistic differences of T6SS effector loading can denote if the secreted toxin will localize to the cytosol or periplasm of a Gram-negative competitor (29Quentin D. Ahmad S.

Patel A. et al.A family of T6SS antibacterial effectors related to l,d-transpeptidases targets the peptidoglycan.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107813Google Scholar). Additionally, these effectors are often coexpressed with an immunity protein that directly binds the effector to neutralize its enzymatic function for self-protection. In many Gram-negative bacteria, adjacent cells battle each other in a ‘tit for tat’ manner with secreted volleys of their unique set of T6SS effectors (1Basler M. Ho B.T. Mekalanos J.J. Tit-for-tat: type VI secretion system counterattack during bacterial cell-cell interactions.Cell. 2013; 152: 884-894Google Scholar). If the cells contain the same set of effectors and cognate immunity proteins, both cells live. If their T6SS effectors differ, one species may outcompete the other and establish niche dominance (2Jurenas D. Journet L. Activity, delivery, and diversity of Type VI secretion effectors.Mol. Microbiol. 2021; 115: 383-394Google Scholar, 39Allsopp L.P. Bernal P. Nolan L.M. Filloux A. Causalities of war: the connection between type VI secretion system and microbiota.Cell Microbiol. 2020; 22e13153Google Scholar). A prominent example of the T6SS effectors arms race can be seen in the evolution of the numerous effectors that target the peptidoglycan (40Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Bayer-Santos E. Targeting the achilles' heel of bacteria: different mechanisms to break down the peptidoglycan cell wall during bacterial warfare.J. Bacteriol. 2021; 203e00478-20Google Scholar). In Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer within the periplasm envelops the cytoplasmic membrane to maintain cell shape and prevent bursting due to the osmotic pressure (41Vollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. Peptidoglycan structure and architecture.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Google Scholar, 42Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 10: 123-136Google Scholar). As such, toxin-catalyzed degradation of the peptidoglycan layer causes morphological changes to the cell that result in growth inhibition and eventual cell lysis (5Chou S. Bui N.K. Russell A.B. Lexa K.W. Gardiner T.E. LeRoux M. et al.Structure of a peptidoglycan amidase effector targeted to Gram-negative bacteria by the type VI secretion system.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 656-664Google Scholar, 37Wood T.E. Howard S.A.

Patel A. et al.A family of T6SS antibacterial effectors related to l,d-transpeptidases targets the peptidoglycan.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107813Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan structure consists of alternating GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) glycan residues that are crosslinked via short peptides. In most Gram-negative bacteria, newly synthesized peptides have the specific linkage order of L-Alanine1 (L-Ala), D-isoglutamic acid2 (D-iGlu), meso-diaminopimelic acid3 (mDAP), D-Alanine4 (D-Ala), and D-Alanine5 (D-Ala) (42Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 10: 123-136Google Scholar). To promote structural stability and rigidity of the peptidoglycan later, peptides protruding from adjacent glycan chains are crosslinked by different classes of transpeptidases (TPases). DD-TPases form a 4-3 crosslink between D-Ala4 and mDAP3, whereas LD-TPases form a 3-3 crosslink between mDAPs3 from two tetrapeptides (43Vollmer W. Bertsche U. Murein (peptidoglycan) structure, architecture and biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1714-1734Google Scholar). DD-TPases, also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), contain a conserved catalytic serine residue that removes D-Alanine5 from one peptide stem creating an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The 4-3 crosslink is formed through nucleophilic attack by an amino group of mDAP3 on a neighboring peptide stem regenerating the enzyme (43Vollmer W. Bertsche U. Murein (peptidoglycan) structure, architecture and biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1714-1734Google Scholar, 44Lovering A.L. Safadi S.S. Strynadka N.C. Structural perspective of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and assembly.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 451-478Google Scholar). LD-TPases catalyze a 3-3 crosslink through nucleophilic attack on one stem, which releases D-Ala4 and any subsequent moieties in the stem. This forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate via a conserved catalytic cysteine residue. Finally, the LD-TPase is deacylated by nucleophilic attack from the amino group of a neighboring mDAP3 from the acceptor tetrapeptide (43Vollmer W. Bertsche U. Murein (peptidoglycan) structure, architecture and biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1714-1734Google Scholar, 45Aliashkevich A. Cava F. LD-Transpeptidases: the great unknown among the peptidoglycan crosslinkers.FEBS J. 2021; 289: 4718-4730Google Scholar). Given the complexity of the peptidoglycan structure, T6SS-harboring bacteria have evolved effectors that target different molecular features of the peptidoglycan as part of the bacterial competition strategies (40Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Bayer-Santos E. Targeting the achilles' heel of bacteria: different mechanisms to break down the peptidoglycan cell wall during bacterial warfare.J. Bacteriol. 2021; 203e00478-20Google Scholar). The characterized Tae (type VI amidase effector) family of effectors from Pseudomonas species and the Ssp enzymes from Serratia species act as amidases that cleave within peptides (3Russell A.B.

Microbiol. 2012; 86: 921-936Google Scholar). Additionally, specific amidase effectors have evolved to cleave between D-iGlu2 and mDAP3 (Tae1, Ssp1) or mDAP3 and D-Ala4 within a crosslink (Tae2, Tae3) (4Russell A.B. Singh P. Brittnacher M. Bui N.K. Hood R.D. Carl M.A. et al.A widespread bacterial type VI secretion effector superfamily identified using a heuristic approach.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 11: 538-549Google Scholar). Tge (type VI glycoside hydrolase effector) effectors act as glycoside hydrolases, which cleave within the glycan chains (3Russell A.B. Hood R.D. Bui N.K. LeRoux M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D. Type VI secretion delivers bacteriolytic effectors to target cells.Nature. 2011; 475: 343-347Google Scholar, 47Whitney J.C. Chou S. Russell A.B. Biboy J. Gardiner T.E.

Similar to amidase effectors, variations to the T6SS effectors denote a substrate specificity to either cleave the glycan linkage between GlcNAc and MurNAcNAM or MurNAc and GlcNAc (40Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Bayer-Santos E. Targeting the achilles' heel of bacteria: different mechanisms to break down the peptidoglycan cell wall during bacterial warfare.J. Bacteriol. 2021; 203e00478-20Google Scholar). Another T6SS effector family termed Tlde1 was recently found in several Salmonella serovars and in a subset of other Gram-negative bacterial species. Tlde1 (type VI LD-transpeptidase effector 1) effectors possess dual enzymatic activities, as they are able to function both as LD-carboxypeptidases (trimming of tetrapeptides to tripeptides) and LD-transpeptidases (breaking and forming new peptide bonds) (38Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Nicastro G.G. Matsuyama B.Y. Mesnage S. Patel A. et al.A family of T6SS antibacterial effectors related to l,d-transpeptidases targets the peptidoglycan.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107813Google Scholar). Tlde1a is encoded as an effector–immunity pair with its cognate immunity protein Tldi1a within the SPI-6 (Salmonella pathogenicity island 6) T6SS in the Salmonella Typhimurium genome (38Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Nicastro G.G. Matsuyama B.Y. Mesnage S. Patel A. et al.A family of T6SS antibacterial effectors related to l,d-transpeptidases targets the peptidoglycan.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107813Google Scholar, 48Mulder D.T. Cooper C.A. Coombes B.K. Type VI secretion system-associated gene clusters contribute to pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.Infect. Immun. 2012; 80: 1996-2007Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that Tlde1a has the ability to cleave muropeptides (disaccharide peptide subunits) between mDAP3 and D-Ala4 functioning as a LD-carboxypeptidase (CPase). Additionally, Tlde1a can also act as an LD-TPase, with the specialized function of exchanging the D-Ala4 of the tetrapeptide with another D-amino acid (38Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Nicastro G.G. Matsuyama B.Y. Mesnage S. Patel A. et al.A family of T6SS antibacterial effectors related to l,d-transpeptidases targets the peptidoglycan.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107813Google Scholar). Specifically, experiments have demonstrated that Tlde1a can degrade GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetrapeptide isolated from Escherichia coli peptidoglycan into GlcNAc-MurNAc-tripeptides. Moreover, in the presence of D-methionine (D-Met), Tlde1a replaces D-Ala4 of GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetrapeptides with D-Met creating a new GlcNAc-MurNAc-tetrapeptide that the standard CPases of the cell wall recycling machinery might not recognize (38Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Nicastro G.G. Matsuyama B.Y. Mesnage S. Patel A. et al.A family of T6SS antibacterial effectors related to l,d-transpeptidases targets the peptidoglycan.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107813Google Scholar, 49Hernandez S.B. Dorr T. Waldor M.K. Cava F. Modulation of peptidoglycan synthesis by recycled cell wall tetrapeptides.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107578Google Scholar). Overall, the dual activities of Tlde1a have the net effect of hindering cell wall homeostasis, which results in cell swelling and death. Tlde1a contains a catalytic motif with a conserved cysteine similar to LD-TPases, HXX14-17-(S/T)HGCh (underline is conserved catalytic, X is variable, h is hydrophobic) (38Sibinelli-Sousa S. Hespanhol J.T. Nicastro G.G. Matsuyama B.Y. Mesnage S. Patel A. et al.A family of T6SS antibacterial effectors related to l,d-transpeptidases targets the peptidoglycan.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107813Google Scholar). Given that Tlde1a represents a new class of T6SS effector that was recently described, we undertook a structural approach to reveal the molecular features that allow Tlde1 enzymes to possess both LD-CPase and LD-TPase exchange activities. Here, we determined high resolution X-ray structures of Tlde1a from S. Typhimurium alone and in complex with D-Ala and D-Met. We observe that Tlde1a has a structurally altered LD-TPase domain that includes a capping subdomain. Structure guided point mutations to analyze target cell toxicity and peptidoglycan degradation revealed the molecular features of Tlde1a that provide its dual enzymatic activities. Additionally, biochemical experiments show that the LD-CPase and LD-TPase exchange activities are structurally and functionally linked. Moreover, enzymatic assays with peptidoglycan revealed that Tlde1a can also perform LD-TPase reactions with a tetrapeptide acceptor, generating 3-3 small amounts of crosslinks. Together, our results demonstrate that Tlde1a contains a single large active site cleft bounded by a capping subdomain for muropeptide binding, with two smaller pockets surrounding the catalytic cysteine. One pocket positions the terminal D-Ala4 of a tetrapeptide stem for cleavage, and the second pocket accepts an incoming D-amino acid for exchange and transpeptidation. To probe the molecular details of Tlde1a, purified Tlde1a from S. Typhimurium was crystallized and its structure determined using X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Although the cognate immunity protein Tldi1a was included in a coexpression construct with Tlde1a, the immunity protein failed to copurify with the His-tagged effector. Tlde1a crystallized as a monomer in the space group P41212 and the structure was modeled to a resolution of 1.65 Å. Initial phases were obtained by single anomalous diffraction on a home source diffractometer using Tlde1a crystals soaked with sodium iodide. Due to the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) in the buffer conditions, the active site residue C131 was modified to S,S-(2-hydroxymethyl)thiocysteine (CME).

https://openalex.org/W4299805934,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides in cells. In recent years, extensive attention has been dedicated to exploring safe and effective natural ferroptosis regulators which can provide novel treatment strategies for ferroptosis-related diseases. This study identified galangin, a natural flavonoid, as an effective inhibitor of ferroptosis, which could increase cell viability in RSL3-inhibited HT1080 cells, decrease levels of lipid ROS and MDA, improve PTGS2 mRNA expression, and enhance the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Ferroptosis is widely present in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. This study found that galangin significantly ameliorated the pathological damage of liver tissue in mice with IR, reduced levels of serum ALT, AST, and MDA, and increased the expression of GPX4. The results of RNA-seq exhibited ferroptosis was significant and the PI3K/AKT pathway deserved to explore the inhibition effects of galangin on ferroptosis. Indeed, galangin treatment significantly rescued RSL3-inhibited phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and CREB proteins, and the ferroptosis inhibitory effects of galangin were counteracted by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These findings indicated that galangin may exert its anti-ferroptosis effects via activating the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway and it will hopefully serve as a promising effective measure to attenuate IR injury by inhibiting ferroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4297473005,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is a heat-activated ion channel expressed in peripheral sensory neurons and the central nervous system. TRPM3 activity depends on the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), but the molecular mechanism of activation by PI(4,5)P2 is not known. As no experimental structure of TRPM3 is available, we built a homology model of the channel in complex with PI(4,5)P2 via molecular modeling. We identified putative contact residues for PI(4,5)P2 in the pre-S1 segment, the S4–S5 linker, and the proximal C-terminal TRP domain. Mutating these residues increased sensitivity to inhibition of TRPM3 by decreasing PI(4,5)P2 levels. Changes in ligand-binding affinities via molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) showed reduced PI(4,5)P2 affinity for the mutants. Mutating PI(4,5)P2-interacting residues also reduced sensitivity for activation by the endogenous ligand pregnenolone sulfate, pointing to an allosteric interaction between PI(4,5)P2 and pregnenolone sulfate. Similarly, mutating residues in the PI(4,5)P2 binding site in TRPM8 resulted in increased sensitivity to PI(4,5)P2 depletion and reduced sensitivity to menthol. Mutations of most PI(4,5)P2-interacting residues in TRPM3 also increased sensitivity to inhibition by Gβγ, indicating allosteric interaction between Gβγ and PI(4,5)P2 regulation. Disease-associated gain-of-function TRPM3 mutations on the other hand resulted in no change of PI(4,5)P2 sensitivity, indicating that mutations did not increase channel activity via increasing PI(4,5)P2 interactions. Our data provide insight into the mechanism of regulation of TRPM3 by PI(4,5)P2, its relationship to endogenous activators and inhibitors, as well as identify similarities and differences between PI(4,5)P2 regulation of TRPM3 and TRPM8.

Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is a heat-activated, outwardly rectifying, and Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel expressed in a variety of tissues, including peripheral sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, and the central nervous system (1Oberwinkler J. Philipp S.E. Trpm3.Handb Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 222: 427-459Google Scholar). Its chemical activators include the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) (2Wagner T.F. Loch S. Lambert S. Straub I. Mannebach S. Mathar I. et al.Transient receptor potential M3 channels are ionotropic steroid receptors in pancreatic beta cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1421-1430Google Scholar) and the synthetic compound CIM0216 (3Held K. Kichko T. De Clercq K. Klaassen H. Van Bree R. Vanherck J.C. et al.Activation of TRPM3 by a potent synthetic ligand reveals a role in peptide release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: E1363-E1372Google Scholar). TRPM3 activity can be inhibited by a number of compounds, including natural flavonones, such as isosakuranetin (4Straub I. Krugel U. Mohr F. Teichert J. Rizun O. Konrad M. et al.Flavanones that selectively inhibit TRPM3 attenuate thermal nociception in vivo.Mol.

Primidone inhibits TRPM3 and attenuates thermal nociception in vivo.Pain. 2017; 158: 856-867Google Scholar). TRPM3 is a very well-established peripheral noxious heat sensor. Genetic deletion of this channel in mice results in impaired noxious heat sensation (6Vriens J. Owsianik G. Hofmann T. Philipp S.E. Stab J.

Tao Y.X. Rohacs T. TRPM3 channels play roles in heat hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain after nerve injury.J. Neurosci. 2020; 41: 2457-2474Google Scholar). TRPM3 inhibitors also reduce thermal hyperalgesia and basal heat sensitivity (4Straub I. Krugel U. Mohr F. Teichert J. Rizun O. Konrad M. et al.Flavanones that selectively inhibit TRPM3 attenuate thermal nociception in vivo.Mol. Pharmacol. 2013; 84: 736-750Google Scholar, 5Krugel U. Straub I. Beckmann H. Schaefer M.

TRPM3 channels play roles in heat hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain after nerve injury.J. Neurosci. 2020; 41: 2457-2474Google Scholar). Activation of Gi-coupled receptors inhibits TRPM3 activity. This effect was demonstrated both by native receptors in dorsal root ganglia neurons, including μ-opioid and GABAB receptors (9Badheka D. Yudin Y. Borbiro I. Hartle C.M. Yazici A. Mirshahi T. et al.Inhibition of transient receptor potential melastatin 3 ion channels by G-protein βγ subunits.Elife. 2017; 6e26147Google Scholar, 10Dembla S. Behrendt M. Mohr F. Goecke C.

Alkhatib O. Gentry C. Andersson D.A. Bevan S. G protein betagamma subunits inhibit TRPM3 ion channels in sensory neurons.Elife. 2017; 6e26138Google Scholar), as well as by heterologously expressing Gi-coupled receptors such as M2 muscarinic receptor and μ-opioid receptors (9Badheka D. Yudin Y. Borbiro I. Hartle C.M. Yazici A. Mirshahi T. et al.Inhibition of transient receptor potential melastatin 3 ion channels by G-protein βγ subunits.Elife. 2017; 6e26147Google Scholar, 10Dembla S. Behrendt M. Mohr F. Goecke C. Sondermann J. Schneider F.M. et al.Anti-nociceptive action of peripheral mu-opioid receptors by G-beta-gamma protein-mediated inhibition of TRPM3 channels.Elife. 2017; 6e26280Google Scholar). Inhibition by Gi-coupled receptors is mediated by direct binding of Gβγ to the channel protein (9Badheka D. Yudin Y. Borbiro I. Hartle C.M. Yazici A. Mirshahi T. et al.Inhibition of transient receptor potential melastatin 3 ion channels by G-protein βγ subunits.Elife. 2017; 6e26147Google Scholar, 10Dembla S. Behrendt M. Mohr F. Goecke C.

Alkhatib O. Gentry C. Andersson D.A. Bevan S. G protein betagamma subunits inhibit TRPM3 ion channels in sensory neurons.Elife. 2017; 6e26138Google Scholar) through a short α-helical peptide encoded by an alternatively spliced exon in TRPM3, the costructure of which with Gβγ has been recently determined by X-ray crystallography (12Behrendt M. Gruss F. Enzeroth R. Dembla S. Zhao S. Crassous P.A. et al.The structural basis for an on-off switch controlling Gbetagamma-mediated inhibition of TRPM3 channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 29090-29100Google Scholar). (TRPM3 has a large number of splice variants, and some of the alternatively spliced exons are in the N terminus (1Oberwinkler J. Philipp S.E. Trpm3.Handb Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 222: 427-459Google Scholar), which makes residue numbering confusing (13Dyment D.A. Terhal P.A. Rustad C.F. Tveten K. Griffith C. Jayakar P. et al.De novo substitutions of TRPM3 cause intellectual disability and epilepsy.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2019; 27: 1611-1618Google Scholar, 14Van Hoeymissen E. Held K. Nogueira Freitas A.C.

Yudin Y. Rohacs T. Disease-associated mutations in the human TRPM3 render the channel overactive via two distinct mechanisms.Elife. 2020; 9e55634Google Scholar)). The Gβγ binding peptide is present in TRPM1, the closest relative of TRPM3, which is also inhibited by Gβγ (16Shen Y. Rampino M.A. Carroll R.C. Nawy S. G-protein-mediated inhibition of the Trp channel TRPM1 requires the Gbetagamma dimer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 8752-8757Google Scholar), but it is missing from the rest of the TRPM family. Activation of recombinant (9Badheka D. Yudin Y. Borbiro I. Hartle C.M. Yazici A. Mirshahi T. et al.Inhibition of transient receptor potential melastatin 3 ion channels by G-protein βγ subunits.Elife. 2017; 6e26147Google Scholar) or native (17Alkhatib O. da Costa R. Gentry C. Quallo T. Bevan S. Andersson D.A. Promiscuous G-protein-coupled receptor inhibition of transient receptor potential melastatin 3 ion channels by Gbetagamma subunits.J. Neurosci. 2019; 39: 7840-7852Google Scholar) Gq-coupled receptors may also inhibit TRPM3, which is also mediated mainly by Gβγ binding (9Badheka D. Yudin Y. Borbiro I. Hartle C.M. Yazici A. Mirshahi T. et al.Inhibition of transient receptor potential melastatin 3 ion channels by G-protein βγ subunits.Elife. 2017; 6e26147Google Scholar). It was recently shown that mutations in TRPM3 are associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies manifesting as intellectual disability and seizures in children (13Dyment D.A. Terhal P.A. Rustad C.F. Tveten K. Griffith C. Jayakar P. et al.De novo substitutions of TRPM3 cause intellectual disability and epilepsy.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2019; 27: 1611-1618Google Scholar). The originally described two disease-associated mutations both showed a gain-of-function phenotype with increased basal activity and increased heat and agonist sensitivity (14Van Hoeymissen E. Held K. Nogueira Freitas A.C. Janssens A. Voets T. Vriens J. Gain of channel function and modified gating properties in TRPM3 mutants causing intellectual disability and epilepsy.Elife. 2020; 9e57190Google Scholar, 15Zhao S. Yudin Y. Rohacs T. Disease-associated mutations in the human TRPM3 render the channel overactive via two distinct mechanisms.Elife. 2020; 9e55634Google Scholar). This points to the importance of TRPM3 in the brain, but knowledge on the functional role of TRPM3 in the central nervous system is quite limited (18Held K. Toth B.I. TRPM3 in brain (patho)physiology.Front Cell Dev. Biol. 2021; 9635659Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides, especially PI(4,5)P2, are common ion channel regulators (19Logothetis D.E. Petrou V.I. Zhang M. Mahajan R. Meng X.Y. Adney S.K. et al.Phosphoinositide control of membrane protein function: a frontier led by studies on ion channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77: 81-104Google Scholar, 20Suh B.C. Hille B. PIP2 is a necessary cofactor for ion channel function: how and why?.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 175-195Google Scholar). Most TRP channels, including TRPM3 (21Badheka D. Borbiro I. Rohacs T. Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 is a phosphoinositide dependent ion channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2015; 146: 65-77Google Scholar, 22Toth B.I. Konrad M. Ghosh D. Mohr F. Halaszovich C.R. Leitner M.G. et al.Regulation of the transient receptor potential channel TRPM3 by phosphoinositides.J. Gen. Physiol. 2015; 146: 51-63Google Scholar), are positively regulated by phosphoinositides (23Rohacs T. Phosphoinositide regulation of TRP channels.Handb Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 233: 1143-1176Google Scholar), but in some cases such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) (24Rohacs T. Phosphoinositide regulation of TRPV1 revisited.Pflugers Arch. 2015; 467: 1851-1869Google Scholar, 25Yazici A.T. Gianti E. Kasimova M.A. Lee B.H. Carnevale V. Rohacs T. Dual regulation of TRPV1 channels by phosphatidylinositol via functionally distinct binding sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100573Google Scholar), or transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC) (26Trebak M. Lemonnier L. DeHaven W.I. Wedel B.J. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Complex functions of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in regulation of TRPC5 cation channels.Pflugers Arch. 2009; 457: 757-769Google Scholar, 27Ningoo M. Plant L.D. Greka A. Logothetis D.E. PIP2 regulation of TRPC5 channel activation and desensitization.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100726Google Scholar), this regulation is complex, and sometimes controversial, with both negative and positive effects having been proposed. With the exception of TRPM1, which is very difficult to study in expression systems, all members of the TRPM subfamily have been shown to be positively regulated by PI(4,5)P2, and no negative regulation has been proposed for any TRPM subfamily member (23Rohacs T. Phosphoinositide regulation of TRP channels.Handb Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 233: 1143-1176Google Scholar). While cryo-EM structures are available for five of eight members, the only TRPM channel for which the PI(4,5)P2 binding site is revealed by structural studies is TRPM8 (28Yin Y. Le S.C. Hsu A.L. Borgnia M.J. Yang H. Lee S.Y. Structural basis of cooling agent and lipid sensing by the cold-activated TRPM8 channel.Science. 2019; 363eaav9334Google Scholar). Currently, it is not known which residues in the TRPM3 protein PI(4,5)P2 binds to, and there is no experimentally determined structure available for TRPM3. To fill this key gap in knowledge, we generated a homology model of TRPM3, based on the experimental structure of TRPM4 in the ligand-free (apo) state (29Guo J. She J. Zeng W. Chen Q. Bai X.C. Jiang Y. Structures of the calcium-activated, non-selective cation channel TRPM4.Nature. 2017; 552: 205-209Google Scholar). We then docked PI(4,5)P2 to our model of TRPM3 and identified putative PI(4,5)P2-interacting residues in the pre-S1 segment, the S4–S5 linker, and the proximal C-terminal TRP domain. We validated our results by docking PI(4,5)P2 to an apo structure of TRPM8 (30Yin Y. Wu M. Zubcevic L. Borschel W.F. Lander G.C. Lee S.Y. Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8.Science. 2018; 359: 237-241Google Scholar), which showed remarkable similarity to the TRPM8–PI(4,5)P2 structures (28Yin Y. Le S.C. Hsu A.L. Borgnia M.J. Yang H. Lee S.Y. Structural basis of cooling agent and lipid sensing by the cold-activated TRPM8 channel.Science. 2019; 363eaav9334Google Scholar), experimentally determined recently. In silico mutations of the PI(4,5)P2 contact residues in TRPM3, followed by ligand-binding affinity changes via molecular MM/GBSA, showed reduced PI(4,5)P2 binding affinity to TRPM3. We experimentally validated the importance of these residues by demonstrating that their mutations increased sensitivity to inhibition by PI(4,5)P2 depletion in electrophysiology experiments. We also showed that mutating most of these residues increased sensitivity to Gβγ inhibition, and decreased sensitivity to agonist activation, indicating allosteric interaction between PI(4,5)P2 and endogenous activators and inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that gain-of-function disease–associated mutations did not change PI(4,5)P2 sensitivity, indicating that the mutations do not increase channel activity via promoting PI(4,5)P2 activation. Our data provide mechanistic insights into regulation of TRPM3 by its key endogenous cofactor PI(4,5)P2. Our goal in this study was to identify the PI(4,5)P2 binding site of TRPM3. As there is currently no experimentally determined TRPM3 structure available, we generated a homology model of the human TRPM3 (hTRPM3) based on the cryo-EM structure of the mouse TRPM4 in the apo state (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 6BCJ) (29Guo J. She J. Zeng W. Chen Q. Bai X.C. Jiang Y. Structures of the calcium-activated, non-selective cation channel TRPM4.Nature. 2017; 552: 205-209Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). The template was selected as the closest homolog to TRPM3 in the TRPM family with an experimental structure available when the model was built (see the Experimental procedures section and Scheme S1 for details). Our model of TRPM3 aligns very well with the models of TRPM3 from different organisms generated recently by AlphaFold (31Varadi M. Anyango S. Deshpande M. Nair S. Natassia C. Yordanova G. et al.AlphaFold protein structure database: massively expanding the structural coverage of protein-sequence space with high-accuracy models.Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; 50: D439-D444Google Scholar, 32Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Google Scholar) (Fig. S1), as well as with a model of TRPM3 obtained using the experimental structure of mouse TRPM7 (33Duan J. Li Z. Li J. Hulse R.E. Santa-Cruz A. Valinsky W.C. et al.Structure of the mammalian TRPM7, a magnesium channel required during embryonic development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E8201-E8210Google Scholar) in EDTA (PDB ID: 5ZX5) as the template (Fig. S2), all of which became available after our original homology model was built, providing a posteriori validation of our TRPM3 model. Next, we identified putative residues interacting with PI(4,5)P2 in TRPM3 by using two complementary approaches. First, we scanned the surface of apo TRPM3 (model built on TRPM4) for putative binding sites using the program SiteMap (Schrödinger, LLC, 2018) (34Halgren T.A. Identifying and characterizing binding sites and assessing druggability.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2009; 49: 377-389Google Scholar, 35Halgren T. New method for fast and accurate binding-site identification and analysis.Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2007; 69: 146-148Google Scholar). Second, we relied on sequence and structural information available on TRPM8 to detect, by homology, which residues are likely to interact with PI(4,5)P2. Specifically, (1) we generated a sequence alignment of TRP-domain residues, K995, R998, and R1108, in the rat TRPM8, which are conserved among TRPM family members (Fig. 1C), and were previously suggested to play a key role in PI(4,5)P2 interactions (36Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. PI(4,5)P2 regulates the activation and desensitization of TRPM8 channels through the TRP domain.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Google Scholar) and (2) starting from the apo cryo-EM structure of the flycatcher apo TRPM8 (fcTRPM8) (PDB ID: 6BPQ) (30Yin Y. Wu M. Zubcevic L. Borschel W.F. Lander G.C. Lee S.Y. Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8.Science. 2018; 359: 237-241Google Scholar), we built a refined model of this channel bound to PI(4,5)P2 at a site that includes the conserved TRP-domain residues (Fig. 2, A and B). Comparing this complex with the apo-TRPM3 model showed that the most suitable site for lipid binding (i.e., the top-scoring binding spot combining SiteMap predictions and structural information) in TRPM3 corresponded to the PI(4,5)P2 site identified in TRPM8. We used this lipid-binding site to generate a model of TRPM3 in complex with a version of PI(4,5)P2 with truncated tails (similar to the synthetic diC8 PI(4,5)P2, which is fully functional in experiments) by molecular docking using the program Glide (37Friesner R.A. Murphy R.B. Repasky M.P. Frye L.L. Greenwood J.R. Halgren T.A. et al.Extra precision glide: docking and scoring incorporating a model of hydrophobic enclosure for protein-ligand complexes.J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6177-6196Google Scholar). We ranked the lipid binding modes by the standard precision scoring function. The best binding mode in TRPM3, defined as the best docking score (kilocalorie/mole) obtained at the binding site similar to that in TRPM8, is shown in Figure 1, A and B. The PI(4,5)P2 binding site in TRPM3 is formed by parts of the preS1 segment, the S4–S5 loop, and the proximal C-terminal TRP domain of the same subunit. The closest contact residues with PI(4,5)P2 are W761 in the preS1 segment, the N991 and K992 residues in segment connecting the voltage sensor–like domain (S1–S4) to the S4–S5 linker and the R1131 in the TRP domain (Fig. 1B). Figure 1B also shows the location of two additional residues, K1128 and R1141 in the TRP domain, which are not in close contact with PI(4,5)P2, but we experimentally characterized their mutations (see later). The numbering of these residues corresponds to the splice variant of hTRPM3 (hTRPM1325) (15Zhao S. Yudin Y. Rohacs T. Disease-associated mutations in the human TRPM3 render the channel overactive via two distinct mechanisms.Elife. 2020; 9e55634Google Scholar, 38Grimm C. Kraft R. Sauerbruch S. Schultz G. Harteneck C. Molecular and functional characterization of the melastatin-related cation channel TRPM3.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21493-21501Google Scholar), which we used in the majority of our experiments. Comparing our model of TRPM8 in complex with PI(4,5)P2 with the subsequently determined two cryo-EM structures of TRPM8 with PI(4,5)P2 (28Yin Y. Le S.C. Hsu A.L. Borgnia M.J. Yang H. Lee S.Y. Structural basis of cooling agent and lipid sensing by the cold-activated TRPM8 channel.Science. 2019; 363eaav9334Google Scholar), icilin (PDB ID: 6NR3), and with the menthol analog WS12 (PDB ID: 6NR2), offered a posteriori validation of our modeling (Table S1). Fig. S3 compares the PI(4,5)P2 binding pockets of the TRPM8–PI(4,5)P2–icilin structure, the TRPM8–PI(4,5)P2–WS12 structure, and our computational model. Our model superposes very well with both structures in the transmembrane domains, but it shows a better structural alignment of the PI(4,5)P2 binding site with the TRPM8–PI(4,5)P2–WS12 (PDB ID: 6NR2) structure than the TRPM8–PI(4,5)P2–icilin–calcium structure (PDB ID: 6NR3). In fact, the minimum RMSD values, calculated over amino-acid ranges facing the lipid-binding sites between any two aligned structures, were 1.49 and 2.34 Å, respectively (Table 1). Interestingly, the structural difference between the two experimental structures (minimum RMSD of 1.99 Å) is larger than that observed between our model and the closest experimental complex (minimum RMSD of 1.49 Å).Table 1Structural comparison between TRPM8 model and experimental structuresRMSD (Å)TRPM8 model6NR2 (PI(4,5)P2 and WS12)6NR3 (PI(4,5)P2, icilin, and Ca2+)Selection01.492.34Sel-101.692.92Sel-21.4901.99Sel-11.6902.26Sel-22.341.990.0Sel-12.922.260.0Sel-2RMSD was calculated independently on two different TRPM8-residue selections (details are provided in Experimental procedures section) using the TRPM8 model or the TRPM8 experimental structures 6NR2 or 6NR3 as reference (RMSD = 0.0 Å).

All these residues, with the exception of R850, are in contact with, or very close to PI(4,5)P2 in our TRPM8–PI(4,5)P2 model. R850 is in contact with the acyl chain of PI(4,5)P2 in our model, and only in contact with the PI(4,5)P2 headgroup in the 6NR3, but not in the 6NR2 structure, which is consistent with the better alignment of our model with the 6NR2 PI(4,5)P2-TRPM8 structure. Overall, our TRPM8–PI(4,5)P2 docking model validates our computational approach to identify the TRPM3 PI(4,5)P2 binding site and suggests that PI(4,5)P2 likely binds to a site that is similar in TRPM3 and TRPM8. Furthermore, superimposition of our model to the experimental structure of TRPM7 in EDTA (PDB ID: 5ZX5) (33Duan J. Li Z. Li J. Hulse R.E. Santa-Cruz A. Valinsky W.C. et al.Structure of the mammalian TRPM7, a magnesium channel required during embryonic development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E8201-E8210Google Scholar) revealed that the docked PI(4,5)P2 in our model of TRPM3 fits well in a cavity of the experimental structure of TRPM7 that accommodates a detergent cholesteryl hemisuccinate molecule (Fig. S4). Whether this binding site is occupied by PI(4,5)P2 in TRPM7 in a cellular environment, remains to be determined, nevertheless the presence of this lipid-binding pocket in TRPM7 suggests that the location of the PI(4,5)P2 binding site may be conserved in multiple members of the TRPM subfamily. In our TRPM3-PI(4,5)P2 model, residues K992 and R1131 are equivalent to the experimentally determined PI(4,5)P2 contact sites R850 and R997 in TRPM8, located in the S4–S5 loop and the TRP domain (Fig. 1C). Specifically, N991 is adjacent to K992, and W761 in the pre-S1 segment of TRPM3 is shifted six residues from the R688 residue in TRPM8. The equivalent of W761 in TRPM8 (W682) is relatively close to PI(4,5)P2 in TRPM8, and so is the equivalent of R688 in TRPM3 (M767) highlighting the generally similar importance of the pre-S1 segment in PI(4,5)P2 binding in the two channels. The largest difference between the two binding sites is that the MHR4 region, which carries K605 in TRPM8, is not conserved in TRPM3, and the equivalent residue is far away from PI(4,5)P2 in our TRPM3 model. Overall, the two channels bind PI(4,5)P2 in a similar, yet not identical manner (Fig. S5). Next, we mutated the predicted PI(4,5)P2-interacting residues in TRPM3 and tested the effects of the mutations on sensitivity to inhibition by decreasing PI(4,5)P2 levels. We expressed the WT and mutant channels in Xenopus oocytes and performed two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) experiments. We stimulated channel activity with 50 μM PregS and measured current amplitudes, then incubated the oocytes with 35 μM wortmannin for 2 h, and measured PregS-induced currents in the same oocytes (Fig. 3, A and B). Wortmannin at this concentration inhibits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases and has been used to inhibit the activity of PI(4,5)P2-dependent ion channels (39Yudin Y. Liu L. Nagwekar J. Rohacs T. Methods to study phosphoinositide regulation of ion channels.Methods Enzymol. 2021; 652: 49-79Google Scholar). We showed earlier that at 35 nM, a concentration that selectively inhibits phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), wortmannin did not inhibit TRPM3 (21Badheka D. Borbiro I. Rohacs T. Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 is a phosphoinositide dependent ion channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2015; 146: 65-77Google Scholar), indicating that TRPM3 inhibition by 35 μM wortmannin is caused by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, not PI3K. Mutating a PI(4,5)P2-interacting residue is expected to increase inhibition by high concentrations of wortmannin (39Yudin Y. Liu L. Nagwekar J. Rohacs T. Methods to study phosphoinositide regulation of ion channels.Methods Enzymol. 2021; 652: 49-79Google Scholar). We mutated the TRP domain positively charged residues to Q, as equivalent mutations in TRPM8 were shown to be functional, and affect PI(4,5)P2 interactions (36Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. PI(4,5)P2 regulates the activation and desensitization of TRPM8 channels through the TRP domain.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Google Scholar). The rest of the residues we mutated to A, but the W761A mutant was nonfunctional, thus we functionally characterized W761F instead. Mutations of all computationally predicted PI(4,5)P2-interacting residues (W761F, N991A, K992A, and R1131Q) showed significantly higher inhibition after wortmannin treatment than WT TRPM3 (Fig. 3, C–F), and their current amplitudes were also significantly lower than WT TRPM3 (F"
https://openalex.org/W4298008983,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often coordinate transient interactions with multiple proteins to mediate complex signals within large protein networks. Among these, the IDP hub protein G3BP1 can form complexes with cytoplasmic phosphoprotein Caprin1 and ubiquitin peptidase USP10; the resulting control of USP10 activity contributes to a pathogenic virulence system that targets endocytic recycling of the ion channel CFTR. However, while the identities of protein interactors are known for many IDP hub proteins, the relationship between pairwise affinities and the extent of protein recruitment and activity is not well understood. Here, we describe in vitro analysis of these G3BP1 affinities and show tryptophan substitutions of specific G3BP1 residues reduce its affinity for both USP10 and Caprin1. We show that these same mutations reduce the stability of complexes between the full-length proteins, suggesting that copurification can serve as a surrogate measure of interaction strength. The crystal structure of G3BP1 TripleW (F15W/F33W/F124W) mutant reveals a clear reorientation of the side chain of W33, creating a steric clash with USP10 and Caprin1. Furthermore, an amino-acid scan of USP10 and Caprin1 peptides reveals similarities and differences in the ability to substitute residues in the core motifs as well as specific substitutions with the potential to create higher affinity peptides. Taken together, these data show that small changes in component binding affinities can have significant effects on the composition of cellular interaction hubs. These specific protein mutations can be harnessed to manipulate complex protein networks, informing future investigations into roles of these networks in cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W4300690711,"Pathogens are often the main selective agents acting in plant communities, thereby influencing the distribution of polymorphism at loci affecting resistance within and among natural plant populations. In addition, the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions can be drastically affected by abiotic and biotic factors at different spatial and temporal grains. The characterization of the adaptive genetic architecture of disease resistance in native heterogeneous environments is however still missing. In this study, we conducted an in situ Genome-Wide Association study in the spatially heterogeneous native habitat of a highly genetically polymorphic local mapping population of Arabidopsis thaliana, to unravel the adaptive genetic architecture of quantitative disease resistance. Disease resistance largely differed among three native soils and was affected by the presence of the grass Poa annua. The observation of strong crossing reactions norms among the 195 A. thaliana genotypes for disease resistance among micro-habitats, combined with a negative fecundity-disease resistance relationship in each micro-habitat, suggest that alternative local genotypes of A. thaliana are favored under contrasting environmental conditions at the scale of few meters. A complex genetic architecture was detected for disease resistance and fecundity. However, only few QTLs were common between these two traits. Heterogeneous selection in this local population should therefore promote the maintenance of polymorphism at only few candidate resistance genes."
https://openalex.org/W4297473002,"The evolutionarily conserved bacterial proteins MnmE and MnmG collectively install a carboxymethylaminomethyl (cmnm) group at the fifth position of wobble uridines of several tRNA species. While the reaction catalyzed by MnmEG is one of the central steps in the biosynthesis of the methylaminomethyl (mnm) posttranscriptional tRNA modification, details of the reaction remain elusive. Glycine is known to be the source of the carboxy methylamino moiety of cmnm, and a tetrahydrofolate (THF) analog is thought to supply the one carbon that is appended to the fifth position of U. However, the nature of the folate analog remains unknown. This article reports the in vitro biochemical reconstitution of the MnmEG reaction. Using isotopically labeled methyl and methylene THF analogs, we demonstrate that methylene THF is the true substrate. We also show that reduced FAD is required for the reaction and that DTT can replace the NADH in its role as a reductant. We discuss the implications of these methylene-THF and reductant requirements on the mechanism of this key tRNA modification catalyzed by MnmEG."

By acting as scaffolds for protein–protein interactions, HSPGs modulate extracellular ligand gradients, cell signaling networks, and cell–extracellular matrix crosstalk. Aberrant expression of HSPGs and enzymes involved in HSPG biosynthesis and processing has been reported in tumors, with impact in cancer cell behavior and tumor microenvironment properties. However, the roles of specific glycosyltransferases in the deregulated biosynthesis of HSPGs are not fully understood. In this study, we established glycoengineered gastric cancer cell models lacking either exostosin-like glycosyltransferase 2 (EXTL2) or EXTL3 and revealed their regulatory roles in both HS and chondroitin sulfate (CS) biosynthesis and structural features. We showed that EXTL3 is key for initiating the synthesis of HS chains in detriment of CS biosynthesis, intervening in the fine-tuned balance of the HS/CS ratio in cells, while EXTL2 functions as a negative regulator of HS biosynthesis, with impact over the glycoproteome of gastric cancer cells. We demonstrated that KO of EXTL2 enhanced HS levels along with concomitant upregulation of Syndecan-4, which is a major cell surface carrier of HS. This aberrant HS expression profile promoted a more aggressive phenotype, characterized by higher cellular motility and invasion, and impaired activation of Ephrin type-A 4 cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase.

Our findings uncover the biosynthetic roles of EXTL2 and EXTL3 in the regulation of cancer cell GAGosylation and proteoglycans expression and unravel the functional consequences of aberrant HS/CS balance in cellular malignant features. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPGs) comprise an abundant class of glycoconjugates, composed by a core protein with covalently attached HS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. These molecules are ubiquitously expressed, both at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM), and play key roles in cellular physiology, impacting cellular proliferation, adhesion and motility, membrane trafficking, formation of extracellular gradients, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis (1Sarrazin S. Lamanna W.C. Esko J.D. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3a004952Google Scholar). HSPGs are also key players in pathological scenarios, being described as important maestros of cancer cell interaction with the ECM, regulating cancer cell communication, and modulating the tumor microenvironment with impact in disease progression (2Faria-Ramos I. Poças J. Marques C. Santos-Antunes J. Macedo G. Reis C.A. et al.Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans: (Un)Expected allies in cancer clinical management.Biomolecules. 2021; 11: 136Google Scholar). HS chains present high binding affinity to multiple biologically active partners, including transmembrane receptors, ECM structural proteins, and soluble molecules. Therefore, HS chain glycan composition dictates the biological activities of HSPGs (3Afratis N. Gialeli C. Nikitovic D. Tsegenidis T. Karousou E.

Proteoglycans—biomarkers and targets in cancer therapy.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2018; 9: 69Google Scholar). HS chains are linear unbranched polysaccharides composed by repeating disaccharide units of glucosamine and uronic acid residues (6Merry C.L.R. Lindahl U. Couchman J. Esko J.D. Proteoglycans and sulfated glycosaminoglycans.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; Copyright 2022 the Consortium of Glycobiology Editors, La Jolla, California. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor (NY)2022: 217-232Google Scholar). HS biosynthesis occurs in the Golgi apparatus or at the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi interface and is organized in three major events: (i) GAG-protein linker assembly, (ii) HS chain polymerization, and (iii) structural modifications of the elongated chain (7Annaval T. Wild R. Crétinon Y. Sadir R. Vivès R.R. Lortat-Jacob H. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans biosynthesis and post synthesis mechanisms combine few enzymes and few core proteins to generate extensive structural and functional diversity.Molecules. 2020; 25: 4215Google Scholar). The linker assembly is initiated by the addition of a xylose (Xyl) residue to specific serine (Ser) residues on the protein core (8Pönighaus C. Ambrosius M. Casanova J.C. Prante C. Kuhn J. Esko J.D. et al.Human xylosyltransferase II is involved in the biosynthesis of the uniform tetrasaccharide linkage region in chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate proteoglycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5201-5206Google Scholar). This is followed by the sequential addition of two galactose (Gal) and one glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues that form the universal tetrasaccharide GAG-linker GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser, through which HS chains are covalently attached to the protein moiety (6Merry C.L.R. Lindahl U. Couchman J. Esko J.D. Proteoglycans and sulfated glycosaminoglycans.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Essentials of Glycobiology.

Heparan sulfate biosynthesis and sulfation profiles as modulators of cancer signalling and progression.Front. Oncol. 2021; 11778752Google Scholar). The transfer of each monosaccharide residue is catalyzed by a particular glycosyltransferase. The assembly of this GAG-linker also involves additional modification steps, including the transient phosphorylation of the Xyl residue by the kinase FAM20B and phosphatase XYLP, after the addition of the first Gal residue. This step enhances the activity of subsequent acting glycosyltransferases and promotes the maturation of the linker (10Koike T. Izumikawa T. Tamura J. Kitagawa H.

Chem. 2014; 289: 6695-6708Google Scholar). The addition of a single N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) residue to the tetrasaccharide linker then initiates the polymerization of the HS chains, whereas addition of a N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) residue would orientate the biosynthesis pathway toward the assembly of chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS) chains. Addition of this first GlcNAc is catalyzed by two members of the Exostosin (EXT) family, Exostosin-like 2 (EXTL2) and EXTL3, and is followed by further elongation promoted by a hetero-oligomeric complex formed by EXT1 and EXT2, which will catalyze the alternated transfer of GlcNAc and GlcA residues (13McCormick C.

Once polymerized, the pro-heparan chains undergo extensive processing by HS modifying enzymes, including GlcNAc deacetylation and sulfation by N-Deacetylase/N-Sulfotransferases (NDST1-4) (17Grobe K.

Heparan sulfate: biosynthesis, structure, and function.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2016; 325 (Elsevier Academic Press Inc, San Diego): 215-273Google Scholar). These HS chains can then be further modified postsynthetically by heparanase cleavage and 6-O-desulfation catalyzed by extracellular 6-O-endosulfatases (Sulfs), thus generating additional structural diversity with biological relevance (7Annaval T. Wild R. Crétinon Y. Sadir R. Vivès R.R. Lortat-Jacob H. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans biosynthesis and post synthesis mechanisms combine few enzymes and few core proteins to generate extensive structural and functional diversity.Molecules. 2020; 25: 4215Google Scholar). The members of the Exostosin family that dictate the initiation of HS chain biosynthesis, EXTL2 and EXTL3, have been studied regarding their impact on GAG content using both in vitro and in vivo models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the HS elongation steps are not fully understood yet (22Busse-Wicher M. Wicher K.B. Kusche-Gullberg M. The extostosin family: proteins with many functions.Matrix Biol. 2014; 35: 25-33Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that EXTL3 catalyzes with high efficiency the transfer of the first GlcNAc residue to the mature tetrasaccharide linker and that it can also participate in HS elongation by adding GlcNAc to the growing chain, while being inefficient in the transfer of GlcA (14Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. et al.Human tumor suppressor EXT gene family members EXTL1 and EXTL3 encode alpha 1,4- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases that likely are involved in heparan sulfate/heparin biosynthesis.Proc.

Krogh K. et al.The structure of EXTL3 helps to explain the different roles of bi-domain exostosins in heparan sulfate synthesis.Nat. Commun. 2022; 13: 3314Google Scholar). Gene KO experiments performed in mouse models revealed that systemic loss of EXTL3 expression led to early embryonic lethality, furthermore the inactivation of EXTL3 specifically in mice pancreatic islet beta cells caused impaired HS biosynthesis (24Takahashi I. Noguchi N. Nata K. Yamada S. Kaneiwa T. Mizumoto S. et al.Important role of heparan sulfate in postnatal islet growth and insulin secretion.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 383: 113-118Google Scholar), which was also observed in EXTL3 zebrafish mutants (25Lee J.S. von der Hardt S. Rusch M.A. Stringer S.E. Stickney H.L. Talbot W.S. et al.Axon sorting in the optic tract requires HSPG synthesis by ext2 (dackel) and extl3 (boxer).Neuron. 2004; 44: 947-960Google Scholar). In the same line, more recently, it was shown that KO of EXTL3 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells resulted in the abolition of HS expression, which further indicates the crucial role of this enzyme in initiating the biosynthesis of HS chains (26Chen Y.-H. Narimatsu Y. Clausen T.M. Gomes C. Karlsson R. Steentoft C. et al.The GAGOme: a cell-based library of displayed glycosaminoglycans.Nat. Met. 2018; 15: 881-888Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with earlier observations that EXTL3 silencing led to longer HS chains, most probably because of the reduced number of chains being synthesized (27Busse M. Feta A. Presto J. Wilen M. Gronning M. Kjellen L. et al.Contribution of EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3 to heparan sulfate chain elongation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32802-32810Google Scholar). There is still reasonable doubt concerning the role of EXTL2 in HS biosynthesis regulation. EXTL2 is an α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase, exhibiting dual in vitro catalytic activity. Enzymatic assays have shown that this enzyme can act both as a α-GlcNAc and as a α-GalNAc glycosyltransferase toward synthetic linker mimetics. However, it was demonstrated that EXTL2 could not add GlcNAc residues to a mature tetrasaccharide linker substrate (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser) (15Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. The tumor suppressor EXT-like gene EXTL2 encodes an alpha1, 4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase that transfers N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine to the common glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region. The key enzyme for the chain initiation of heparan sulfate.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Google Scholar). More recently, it has been proposed that EXTL2 could mediate an alternative FAM20B-dependent pathway that suppresses HS biosynthesis. According to this model, in the initial steps of HS/CS formation, which entail linker assembly, increased FAM20B kinase activity and/or reduced dephosphorylation by XYLP promote formation and accumulation of the phosphorylated tetrasaccharide linker (GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate)). This phosphorylated sequence can be used as substrate by EXTL2 that catalyzes the transfer of a GlcNAc residue and generates an immature phosphorylated pentasaccharide (GlcNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate)) that cannot be further polymerized by EXT1 and EXT2, thus resulting in the premature termination of HS elongation (12Koike T. Izumikawa T. Sato B. Kitagawa H. Identification of phosphatase that dephosphorylates xylose in the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region of proteoglycans.J. Biol.

However, the regulatory role played by this enzyme in HS biosynthesis still remains controversial. Whereas the downregulation of EXTL2 resulted in increased HS chains length in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, no significant changes were detected when these cells overexpress EXTL2 (30Katta K.

Particularly, gastric tumors have been shown to display aberrant GAGs overall content and altered sulfation patterns (42Theocharis A.D. Vynios D.H. Papageorgakopoulou N. Skandalis S.S. Theocharis D.A. Altered content composition and structure of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans in gastric carcinoma.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 376-390Google Scholar, 43Weyers A. Yang B.

However, the mechanisms underlying the alteration of GAG biosynthesis and HS structure in cancer still need to be further clarified. Additionally, the cell- and tissue-specific GAG biosynthesis regulation by GAG-related enzymes, whose expression is variable at the different stages of pathologies, underlines the importance of addressing the impact of these glycosyltransferases’ enzymatic activities on cancer cell behavior and tumor microenvironment remodeling. In this work, we have evaluated the roles of EXTL2 and EXTL3 in HS biosynthesis in gastric cancer. In addition, we determined the consequences of changes in their expression on the structural features of GAGs in tumor cells’ glycocalyx and their functional impact in cancer cell aggressiveness. To investigate the functional roles of EXTL2 and EXTL3 in HS biosynthesis, KO cell models were generated from the gastric cancer cell line MKN74 via CRISPR-Cas 9 genome editing (Fig. S1, A and B). We first evaluated the effects of EXTL2 or EXTL3 gene KO on HS cellular content. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to measure cell surface HS and revealed that in the absence of EXTL2, cells show increased levels of HS (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence data showed HS staining in cells’ plasma membrane and cytoplasm, for both WT and EXTL2 KO cells, though a higher number of EXTL2 KO cells were positive for 10E4 (Fig. 1B). In line with these observations, Western blot (WB) assays revealed increased total HS content in EXTL2 KO cells, as shown by the stronger HS signal covering a wide range of molecular weight (MW), corresponding to the highly variable HS structures decorating HSPGs (Fig. 1C). In contrast, KO of EXTL3 led to the complete depletion of HS, both at the cell surface (Fig. 1A) and total cell content (Fig. 1, B and C). To further investigate the role of EXTL2 and EXTL3 in the regulation of HS biosynthesis, we examined the number of HS chains in our glycoengineered cell models. Cells were treated with Heparinase III (Hep. III) that specifically digests HS chains and generates smaller HS stubs capped with unsaturated GlcA residues, which are recognized by the 3G10 antibody. Protein extracts from EXTL2 KO cells showed stronger 3G10 labeling, which was particularly evident around 37 kDa (Fig. 1D), suggesting an increase in the number of HS chains upon abrogation of EXTL2. EXTL3 KO cells lacked these HS stub structures (Fig. 1D), in accordance with the data shown in Figure 1, A–C. Taking in consideration the impact on HS biosynthesis observed in the glycoengineered cell models and knowing that Syndecans (SDCs) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI)–anchored Glypicans (GPCs) are major carriers of HS on epithelial cells, we then evaluated the impact of EXTL2 and EXTL3 KO over SDCs and GPCs expression in the gastric cancer cells. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the expression of GPC1 and GPC5 was not altered in glycoengineered models, GPC4 showed lower expression in EXTL2 KO and EXTL3 KO, though the expression level in the WT was already very low, and GPC2, GPC3, and GPC6 were not detected (Fig. 2A). Regarding SDC family members, SDC1 expression remained unaltered upon KO of EXTL2 and EXTL3, SDC2 was not detected, and we observed a trend toward SDC3 overexpression in the glycoengineered models (Fig. 2A). Noteworthy, the expression of SDC4 was significantly increased in both EXTL2 KO clones, while for EXTL3 KO, the expression was variable as the increase was only significant for one of the clones (Fig. 2A). Since we observed that MKN74 cells express mainly the SDC1 and SDC4, we further evaluated their protein levels and GAGosylation profiles by WB. Higher SDC4 protein levels were found in the EXTL2 KO cell model, as evidenced by the increased staining of the fully glycosylated (smear staining) and unglycosylated (37 kDa band staining) SDC4 molecules observed in the nondigested cell lysates (Fig. 2B). Cleavage of HS chains by Hep. III on WT cell lysates led to a marked shift in the staining profile of SDC4, from a smear that covered high MW to a sharp staining at 37 kDa (deglycosylated SDC4). In EXTL2 KO cell lysates upon Hep. III digestion, an intense smear could still be detected in the lower MW range, which was considerably shortened upon combined digestion with Chondroitinase ABC (Chond. ABC) (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that in the absence of EXTL2 gene expression, SDC4 might also be modified with CS/DS chains and that Chond. ABC enzymatic activity is more efficient upon HS removal. This could explain the differences in SDC4 labeling when comparing Hep. III single digestion and Hep. III + Chond. ABC double digestion, as well as the similar staining between nondigestion and Chond. ABC single digestion (Fig. 2B). WB analyses of EXTL3 KO nondigested cell lysates revealed increased signal for glycosylated SDC4, with a large smear between 50 kDa and 250 kDa, while no variations were observed for the labeling of the unglycosylated form at 37 kDa (Fig. 2B). This suggests that HS chains might constitute hindrance to the binding of the anti-SDC4 8G3 antibody to the core protein extracellular domain, hence the increased labeling of glycosylated SDC4 in the cell model that lack these chains. No significant variations were detected in the labeling of SDC4 in EXTL3 KO cells upon single digestion with Hep. III, in agreement with the previous results showing lack of HS in this cell model (Fig. 1). Interestingly, CS/DS cleavage by Chond. ABC eliminated the SDC4 labeling smear (Fig. 2B), which further supports that alternative GAGosylation may occur and that the SDC4 expressed in EXTL3 KO cells is modified with CS/DS chains, instead of HS. Regarding SDC1, HS digestion revealed similar labeling in the WT and EXTL2 KO cells, which was only detected in Hep. III digested samples, while in EXTL3 KO cells that lack HS, GAG digestion had no impact over SDC1 labeling profile (Fig. 2B). To characterize HS and CS glycan structures from EXTL2 KO and EXTL3 KO glycoengineered cancer cell lines, we isolated and purified cellular GAGs and performed HS and CS disaccharide analyses using reversed-phase ion pair HPLC (RPIP-HPLC). Structural analyses showed a trend for increased HS disaccharide content in EXTL2 KO cells, in comparison with WT, while in EXTL3 KO cells HS disaccharides were not detected (Fig. 3A). Also, HS composition appeared to vary between WT and EXTL2 KO cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Results suggest that in the absence of EXTL2 expression, HS exhibits increased levels of nonmodified N-acetylated disaccharides, along with a decrease in overall disaccharide O-sulfation (Fig. 3, B–D). Regarding CS composition, EXTL3 KO resulted in increased CS disaccharide content (Fig. 3E). This observation is in agreement with the high MW smear observed for SDC4 in the EXTL3 KO clones, which was abolished after Chon. ABC digestion (Fig. 2B). The effect of EXTL2 KO on CS expression was more heterogeneous among clones, with only one presenting increased CS disaccharide units (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, no major variations in CS composition were detected for MKN74 glycoengineered cells compared to the WT (Fig. 3, F–H). GAGs are key modulators of ECM physical and biochemical properties, which are capable of binding to different proteins and allow proteoglycans to act as cell surface coreceptors and mechanosignaling transducers, ultimately impacting cell behavior (44Hassan N.

https://openalex.org/W4297984762,"Activated protein C (APC) is an important anticoagulant protein that regulates thrombin generation through inactivation of factor V (FV) and activated factor V (FVa). The rate of APC inactivation of FV is slower compared to FVa, although proteolysis occurs at the same sites (Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679). The molecular basis for FV resistance to APC is unknown. Further, there is no information about how FV-short, a physiologically relevant isoform of FV with a shortened B-domain, is regulated by APC. Here, we identify the molecular determinants which differentially regulate APC recognition of FV versus FVa and uncover how FV-short can be protected from this anticoagulant pathway. Using recombinant FV derivatives and B-domain fragments, we show that the conserved basic region (BR; 963–1008) within the central portion of the B-domain plays a major role in limiting APC cleavage at Arg506. Derivatives of FV lacking the BR, including FV-short, were subject to rapid cleavage at Arg506 and were inactivated like FVa. The addition of a FV-BR fragment reversed this effect and delayed APC inactivation. We also found that anticoagulant glycoprotein TFPIα, which has a C-terminal BR homologous to FV-BR, protects FV-short from APC inactivation by delaying cleavage at Arg506. We conclude that the FV-BR plays a major role in protecting FV from APC inactivation. Using a similar mechanistic strategy, TFPIα also shields FV-short from APC. These findings clarify the resistance of FV to APC, advance our understanding of FV/FVa regulation, and establish a mechanistic framework for manipulating this reaction to alter coagulation.

Coagulation factor V (FV) circulates in blood as an inactive procofactor. It is synthesized as a large multidomain (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) protein in the liver and is also found in the alpha-granules of platelets (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Surface dependent reactions of the vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes.Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Google Scholar). FV is activated to factor Va (FVa) following proteolytic removal of a large central B-domain (residues 710–1545). Factor Va is a cofactor in the prothrombinase complex and binds factor Xa (FXa) and anionic membranes to facilitate the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Surface dependent reactions of the vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes.Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Google Scholar, 2Camire R.M. Bos M.H. The molecular basis of factor V and VIII procofactor activation.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 1951-1961Google Scholar). It enhances the relative rate of thrombin generation by five orders of magnitude compared to FXa alone underscoring its critical role in hemostasis (3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. The contribution of bovine factor V and factor Va to the activity of prothrombinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Google Scholar). Since FV has no procoagulant activity, thrombin or FXa-mediated activation of FV represents a key regulatory point in coagulation. Mechanistic insights into how the B-domain keeps FV inactive have been made and the steps required to convert it to a procoagulant cofactor have been uncovered (4Toso R. Camire R.M.

Expression and characterization of recombinant human factor V and a mutant lacking a major portion of the connecting region.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6762-6768Google Scholar). The data support a model in which two evolutionary conserved regions found in the B-domain (basic region [BR; 963–1008] and acidic region 2 [AR2; 1493–1537]) work together to block the FXa-binding site on the heavy and light chains (6Mettine H.A.B.

Camire R.M. Restoring the procofactor state of factor Va-like variants by complementation with B-domain peptides.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 30151-30160Google Scholar). Together, the BR-AR2 ensemble enforce the FV procofactor state and effectively prevent the expression of cofactor activity (4Toso R. Camire R.M.

Expression and characterization of recombinant human factor V and a mutant lacking a major portion of the connecting region.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6762-6768Google Scholar). Removing either of these functional landmarks through proteolysis or deletion allows for FXa binding and produces a procoagulant cofactor that can assemble in prothrombinase (4Toso R. Camire R.M. Removal of B-domain sequences from factor V rather than specific proteolysis underlies the mechanism by which cofactor function is realized.J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 15033-15039Google Scholar). Importantly, recombinant FV-BR fragments bind with high affinity to physiologic forms of FV that retain AR2 but lack BR. These forms include partially cleaved FV, platelet-derived FV, and a newly identified spliced isoform called FV-short. FV-short was discovered in a family with a moderately severe bleeding disorder (FV-East Texas bleeding disorder). The mutation in the F5 gene (A2440G; S756G) activates a weak splice site in exon 13 resulting in an abundant, alternatively spliced transcript, which encodes for FV-short (10Vincent L.M. Tran S. Livaja R. Bensend T.A. Milewicz D.M. Dahlbäck B. Coagulation factor VA2440G causes east Texas bleeding disorder via TFPIα.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3777-3787Google Scholar, 11Kuang S.Q. Hasham S.

Additional families and mutations have been found that yield high levels of FV-short (12Zimowski K.L. Petrillo T. Ho M.D. Wechsler J. Shields J.E.

Martinez N.D. Hardesty B. Maroney S.A. Mast A.E. Factor V east Texas variant causes bleeding in a three-generation family.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2022; 20: 565-573Google Scholar). This new form of FV lacks 702 amino acids (Δ756–1458) in the B-domain including the BR but it retains AR2 (Fig. 1A). Family members with the mutation have high plasma levels of FV-short (∼2–5 nM) and have elevated TFPIα (10-fold) which form a tight complex in plasma (10Vincent L.M. Tran S. Livaja R. Bensend T.A.

In healthy individuals, splicing occurs at a low level, as FV-short is present in normal plasma at subnanomolar concentration (10Vincent L.M. Tran S. Livaja R. Bensend T.A. Milewicz D.M. Dahlbäck B. Coagulation factor VA2440G causes east Texas bleeding disorder via TFPIα.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3777-3787Google Scholar). We have recently shown that while FV-short is constitutively active, it binds TFPIα with high affinity, which blocks procoagulant function. However, cleavage at Arg1545 relieves this inhibition. These findings show that a key aspect of the regulation of FV is the disengagement of the BR and AR2 and the use of these surfaces by TFPIα to regulate procoagulant function and the initiation of coagulation (8Petrillo T. Ayombil F. van’t Veer C. Camire R.M. Regulation of factor V and factor V-short by TFPIα: relationship between B-domain proteolysis and binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100234Google Scholar). In addition to FV activation and engagement with TFPIα, another point of FV/FV(a) regulation is through the protein C anticoagulant pathway. Protein C is converted to activated protein C (APC) by the thrombin–thrombomodulin complex (15Esmon C.T. Owen W.G.

Complex formation between thrombin and thrombomodulin inhibits both thrombin-catalyzed fibrin formation and factor V activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7944-7947Google Scholar). APC, whose activity is enhanced by its cofactor protein S (PS), regulates hemostasis through the inactivation of the procoagulant activities of FVIIIa and FVa (17Esmon C. The protein C pathway.Crit.

This leads to A2-domain dissociation and loss of cofactor function (22Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. Activated protein C cleavage of factor Va leads to dissociation of the A2 domain.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24904-24911Google Scholar), the physiologic importance of APC cleavage of the procofactor (FV) is less clear. One postulated role relates to the anticoagulant function of FV. FV is thought to act as an anticoagulant cofactor, along with PS, for APC in the inactivation of FVIIIa (34Dahlback B. Factor V and protein S as cofactors to activated protein C.Haematologica. 1997; 82: 91-95Google Scholar). For FV to exert this anticoagulant effect, it is thought it must be cleaved at Arg506, as FV-Leiden does not have anticoagulant function (35Shen L. Dahlbäck B. Factor V and protein S as synergistic cofactors to activated protein C in degradation of factor VIIIa.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Google Scholar, 36Dahlbäck B. Hildebrand B. Inherited resistance to activated protein C is corrected by anticoagulant cofactor activity found to be a property of factor V.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1396-1400Google Scholar). Unlike FVa, FV is cleaved by APC at either Arg306 or Arg506, with a preference for initial cleavage at Arg306 (23Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G.

Proteolytic events that regulate factor V activity in whole plasma from normal and activated protein C (APC)-resistant individuals during clotting: an insight into the APC-resistance assay.Blood. 1996; 87: 4695-4707Google Scholar). This difference in substrate recognition of FV versus FVa contributes to a ∼10-fold reduced rate of inactivation for FV (23Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. The mechanism of inactivation of human factor V and human factor Va by activated protein C.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Google Scholar). Despite the longstanding interest in FV/FVa inactivation, the molecular basis for this difference in rate of proteolytic inactivation and APC specificity remains unclear. It is speculated that exposed electropositive surface loops on APC coupled with extended exosite surfaces adjacent to the Arg506 cleavage site could explain APC’s differential recognition and the rapid cleavage of FVa relative to FV (38Gale A.J. Tsavaler A. Griffin J.H. Molecular characterization of an extended binding site for coagulation factor Va in the positive exosite of activated protein C.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28836-28840Google Scholar, 39Segers K. Dahlbäck B. Rosing J. Nicolaes G.A. Identification of surface epitopes of human coagulation factor Va that are important for interaction with activated protein C and heparin.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22573-22581Google Scholar). Additionally, recent cryo-EM data show that the Arg306 and Arg506 sites appear buried in FV (40Ruben E.A. Rau M.J. Fitzpatrick J.A.J. Di Cera E. Cryo-EM structures of human coagulation factors V and Va.Blood. 2021; 137: 3137-3144Google Scholar) supporting the hypothesis that the bulky B-domain could impair APC recognition via unknown steric and/or allosteric determinants. Given the critical role that FV-BR and AR2 play in the maturation of FVa cofactor function, here we examined whether these B-domain sequences influence APC recognition. Since the FV-BR (and TFPIα-BR) block FXa binding and APC and FXa are known to share a common exosite on FVa, it is reasonable to speculate that FV-BR could alter APC recognition (19Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Factor V: a combination of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Blood. 2002; 101: 20-30Google Scholar, 24Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I.

We also studied APC inactivation of FV-short and examined whether TFPIα has any influence on the reaction. Our findings show that both FV-BR and TFPIα-BR have a major influence on APC inactivation of FV and FV-short. When the BR is present in FV or when TFPIα is bound to FV-short, the rate of APC inactivation is delayed significantly with a major effect on the Arg506 cleavage site. The studies provide new mechanistic insight into why FV and FVa are differentially regulated by APC and uncover how FV-short is protected from this anticoagulant pathway. A schematic representation of FV species used in this study is shown in Figure 1A. Proteins were recombinantly expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and purified from conditioned media or purified from plasma (plasma-derived FV, PD-FV). FV-1033 is a procofactor-like variant with a truncated B-domain (△1034–1491) that retains the conserved BR and AR2 while FV-s46 is like FV-1033 except its BR is exchanged with 46 amino acids of nonconserved FVIII B-domain sequence (5Zhu H. Toso R. Camire R.M. Inhibitory sequences within the B-domain stabilize circulating factor V in an inactive state.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15033-15039Google Scholar). FV-810 (△811–1491) is a previously described B-domainless form of FV that lacks the BR and is like the physiologic isoform, FV-short (△756–1458). APC resistance variants of FV-810 with Gln mutations at Arg306 (FV-810-R306Q), Arg506 (FV-810-R506Q), or both sites (FV-810-QQ) were expressed and purified. FV-B152 is a cofactor-like variant with truncated B-domain regions (△811–963; △1008–1538) and has been previously characterized (6Mettine H.A.B. Camire M.R. A Bipartite autoinhibitory region within the B-domain suppresses function in factor V.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26342-26351Google Scholar). FV-B152 lacks AR2 but retains the BR. Proteins migrated at the expected position on reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). APC inactivates membrane-bound FV/FVa following proteolysis of the HC region at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679 (23Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. The mechanism of inactivation of human factor V and human factor Va by activated protein C.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Google Scholar, 28Odegaard B. Mann K. Proteolysis of factor Va by factor Xa and activated protein C.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11233-11238Google Scholar). Consistent with prior findings, the rate of APC inactivation of PD-FV and rFV is slower compared to FVa (Fig. 2, A–C and F). Western blotting of the HC region shows that FVa is initially cleaved at Arg506 (appearance of 75 kDa fragment) while PD-FV and rFV are initially cleaved at either Arg306 (appearance of 190 kDa fragment) or Arg506 (appearance of 75 kDa fragment) (Fig. 2, A–C). These data show that the procofactor has reduced susceptibility to APC-mediated inactivation and is recognized differently compared to FVa under similar experimental conditions. These differences suggest that the B-domain plays a role in altering substrate recognition by APC. The BR-AR2 (Fig. 1A) region within the FV B-domain is necessary and sufficient to keep FV as an inactive procofactor (4Toso R. Camire R.M. Removal of B-domain sequences from factor V rather than specific proteolysis underlies the mechanism by which cofactor function is realized.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Google Scholar, 5Zhu H. Toso R. Camire R.M. Inhibitory sequences within the B-domain stabilize circulating factor V in an inactive state.J. Biol.

Expression and characterization of recombinant human factor V and a mutant lacking a major portion of the connecting region.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6762-6768Google Scholar). To test whether this region of FV is involved in altering APC recognition, we first prepared two FV derivatives, one with and one without the BR. FV-1033, a procofactor-like variant containing the entire AR1-BR-AR2 region, was inactivated by APC like FV (Fig. 2, D and F). In contrast, swapping out the BR region with nonconserved B-domain sequences from FVIII (FV-s46) (5Zhu H. Toso R. Camire R.M. Inhibitory sequences within the B-domain stabilize circulating factor V in an inactive state.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15033-15039Google Scholar) significantly enhanced the rate of APC inactivation and shifted the initial cleavage to Arg506, like FVa (Fig. 2, E and F). These data show that the endogenous FV-BR somehow influences APC recognition of the procofactor molecule. However, the BR alone is not sufficient to alter APC recognition. For example, FV-B152, which retains the BR but lacks AR2 (6Mettine H.A.B. Camire M.R. A Bipartite autoinhibitory region within the B-domain suppresses function in factor V.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26342-26351Google Scholar), was inactivated rapidly by APC like FVa with initial cleavage primarily occurring at Arg506 (Fig. S1, A and C). These data show that for the endogenous FV-BR to alter APC recognition, it must involve an interaction with AR2. To examine these ideas further, we investigated the inactivation of FV-810 by APC in the presence and absence of exogenous FV-BR fragment. FV-810 (Fig. 1A) retains AR2 and binds the FV-BR fragment with high affinity (KD ∼ 1–2 nM) (7Bunce M.W. Bos M.H.A. Krishnaswamy S. Camire R.M. Restoring the procofactor state of factor Va-like variants by complementation with B-domain peptides.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 30151-30160Google Scholar). In the absence of the exogeneous FV-BR fragment, FV-810 was inactivated by APC like FVa where the HC region was rapidly cleaved at Arg506 with the appearance of 75 kDa fragment (Fig. 3, A and D). The accumulation of the 30 kDa fragment (via subsequent cleavage at Arg306) was visible over time consistent with inactivation of FV-810. In contrast to these data, when excess FV-BR was added in the reaction mixture, the rate of APC inactivation of FV-810 was impaired and initial cleavage in the HC region now favored Arg306 (indicated by accumulation of 171 kDa fragment) versus Arg506 (Fig. 3, B and D). The FV-BR fragment had no influence on the rate of FV inactivation by APC since FV has its own internal BR. Further, FV-BR had no effect on FVa inactivation since FV-BR cannot bind FVa (Fig. S2 and Table 1) and it had no effect on FV-B152, which lacks AR2 (Fig. S1, B and C). In control experiments, we were not able to detect binding between the BR fragment and APC by fluorescence methods and it had no influence on APC proteolytic activity using a peptidyl substrate (Table 1 and Fig. S3). This suggests that the FV-BR fragment does not interact with or alter the function of APC directly. Additional experiments showed that increasing concentrations of FV-BR reduced APC inactivation of FV-810 (Fig. 3C). These data show that the FV-BR when bound to AR2 protects FV from inactivation and appears to have an influence at/near the Arg506 region either directly or allosterically.Table 1Binding constants for TFPIα-BRFV speciesKd ± S.D.n ± S.D.nMmol/molFV-s462.17 ± 0.251.78 ± 0.04FV-short1.56 ± 0.231.18 ± 0.03FV-8101.78 ± 0.281.29 ± 0.04FV-810-R306Q2.15 ± 0.341.44 ± 0.05FV-810-R506Q1.72 ± 0.291.43 ± 0.04FV-810-QQ2.46 ± 0.361.18 ± 0.04FVaNANAFV-1033NANAAPCiNANAFluorescence data were obtained by titrating FV species or APCi into reaction mixtures containing 25 nM OG488-TFPIα-BR and 50 μM PCPS vesicles in assay buffer as described under ‘‘Experimental Procedures.’’ The data were fit to a model for tight binding to obtain the binding constant (KD) and stoichiometry (n).

The finding that FV-BR protects FV-810 from APC cleavage was further evaluated using functional measurements as assessed in a tissue factor initiated thrombin generation assay (TGA). As shown in Figure 4A, when FV-BR was bound to FV-810, APC was much less effective at reducing thrombin generation as assessed by peak thrombin remaining. Since FV-BR cannot bind FVa due to the absence of AR2 (Fig. 1A), FV-BR had no effect on APC inactivation of FVa (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these data, the rate of APC inactivation of FV-1033 compared to FV-s46 as assessed by TGA was much slower when the internal BR region was present (Fig. 4C). FV-short is a physio"

Here, we determined DKK4 expression was significantly upregulated in 23 CRC cell lines and 229 CRC tissues when analyzed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Our analysis of tissue samples indicated the survival time of CRC patients with high DKK4 expression was longer than that of patients with medium-low DKK4 expression. We examined the effects of DKK4 on cell proliferation and metastasis by cell counting kit-8 assays, transwell assays, and subcutaneous and metastatic mouse tumor models, and we discovered that DKK4 silencing promoted the metastasis of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that AKT2, FZD6, and JUN, which play important roles in AKT and Wnt signaling, were significantly increased after DKK4 knockdown. DKK4 represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling by repressing FZD6 and AKT2/s552 β-catenin in CRC. Further experiments revealed recombinant Wnt3a and LiCl could induce DKK4 expression. Moreover, our bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays identified posttranscriptional regulators of DKK4 in CRC cells. In summary, DKK4 is elevated in CRC and inhibits cell metastasis by a novel negative feedback mechanism of the Wnt3a/DKK4/AKT/s552 β-catenin regulatory axis to restrict overactivation of Wnt activity in CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC), with more than 1.8 million new cases each year, is the third most frequent cancer globally. More than 861,000 patients die from CRC each year, which is the second leading cause of cancer death (1Sung H. Ferlay J. Siegel R.L. Laversanne M. Soerjomataram I. Jemal A. et al.Global cancer statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2021; 71: 209-249Google Scholar, 2Arnold M. Sierra M.S. Laversanne M. Soerjomataram I. Jemal A. Bray F. Global patterns and trends in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.Gut. 2017; 66: 683-691Google Scholar). At the same time, the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer are also increasing each year in China (3Chen W. Zheng R. Baade P.D. Zhang S. Zeng H. Bray F. et al.Cancer statistics in China.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2016; 66: 115-132Google Scholar, 4Guo P. Huang Z.L. Yu P. Li K. Trends in cancer mortality in China: an update.Ann. Oncol. 2012; 23: 2755-2762Google Scholar). It is well known that early diagnosis and early surgical resection are generally considered to be the most effective ways to reduce CRC mortality. However, as the early symptoms of colorectal cancer are not obvious, an estimated 50% to 60% of CRC patients present with metastases at the time of diagnosis (5Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Fedewa S.A. Ahnen D.J. Meester R.G.S. Barzi A. et al.Colorectal cancer statistics, 2017.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2017; 67: 177-193Google Scholar). Treatments of advanced CRC include palliative chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as well as local treatment. Nevertheless, the 5-years survival rate is only 14% (6Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2019.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2019; 69: 7-34Google Scholar). Therefore, the study of molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for CRC is essential. The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer, and the Dickkopf (DKK)family is a classical family of inhibitory molecules in this pathway. Increasing evidence suggests that DKK family members play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. The gene family of DKKs encodes the secreted glycoprotein as inhibitory molecules of the typical Wnt signaling pathway, which consists of five members: DKK1-4 and DKKL1 (soggy) (7Niehrs C. Function and biological roles of the Dickkopf family of Wnt modulators.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Google Scholar). DKK glycoproteins, except soggy, contain an N-terminal signaling peptide and two conserved cysteine-rich domains separated by linkers. The cysteine-rich amino-terminal domain (Cys-1) is unique to each DKK, while the carboxy-terminal cysteine-rich domain (Cys-2) is highly conserved among all DKKs. We previously found that miR-100 and miR-125b promoted Wnt signaling activity by targeting DKK1 and DKK3, leading to cetuximab resistance in CRC (8Lu Y. Zhao X. Liu Q. Li C. Graves-Deal R. Cao Z. et al.lncRNA MIR100HG-derived miR-100 and miR-125b mediate cetuximab resistance via wnt/beta-catenin signaling.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 1331-1341Google Scholar). DKK2 is a functional tumor suppressor that regulates the tumorigenesis of CRC by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling (9Wang C. Yue Y. Shao B. Qiu Z. Mu J. Tang J. et al.Dickkopf-related protein 2 is epigenetically inactivated and suppresses colorectal cancer growth and tumor metastasis by antagonizing wnt/β-catenin signaling.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2017; 41: 1709-1724Google Scholar). DKK4 presents inconsistent expression and plays different roles in different cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma, DKK4 expression is reduced, and its induction suppresses tumor progression and proliferation (10Krupnik V.E. Sharp J.D. Jiang C. Robison K. Chickering T.W. Amaravadi L. et al.Functional and structural diversity of the human Dickkopf gene family.Gene. 1999; 238: 301-313Google Scholar). However, DKK4 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. DKK4 activates the MAPK signaling pathway to promote pancreatic cancer progression by regulating VAV3 (11Ouyang Y. Pan J. Tai Q. Ju J. Wang H. Transcriptomic changes associated with DKK4 overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells detected by RNA-seq.Tumour Biol. 2016; 37: 10827-10838Google Scholar) and promotes ovarian cancer metastasis by activating JNK (7Niehrs C. Function and biological roles of the Dickkopf family of Wnt modulators.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Google Scholar, 12Wang S. Wei H. Zhang S. Dickkopf-4 is frequently overexpressed in epithelial ovarian carcinoma and promotes tumor invasion.BMC Cancer. 2017; 17: 455Google Scholar). In CRC, a few studies with limited samples revealed that DKK4 was upregulated in cancer (7Niehrs C. Function and biological roles of the Dickkopf family of Wnt modulators.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Google Scholar, 13Lou X. Meng Y. Hou Y. A literature review on function and regulation mechanism of DKK4.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2021; 25: 2786-2794Google Scholar), but little is known about the association of DKK4 expression and CRC prognosis, and the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we found that DKK4 is highly expressed among 23 colorectal cancer cell lines and 229 CRC tissues, and high DKK4 expression correlates with a longer survival time of CRC patients. Downregulation of DKK4 promotes the migration and invasion of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate the specific mechanism, we found that rhWnt3a activated DKK4 expression, and overexpression of DKK4 inhibited Frizzled 6 (FZD6) and AKT2/s552-β-catenin, forming a negative feedback loop that restrained overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, the expression and function of DKK4 was directly inhibited by miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p. Overall, our studies demonstrated that DKK4 inhibits tumor metastasis in CRC and uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism through the Wnt3a/DKK4/AKT/s552 β-catenin negative feedback loop in CRC. To investigate the DKK4 expression pattern in CRC, we detected DKK4 mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT‒PCR) and protein levels by Western blot in 23 colorectal cancer cell lines and an immortalized human normal intestinal epithelial cell line (FHC). The DKK4 expression level in colorectal cancer cells was significantly higher than that in FHC cells (Fig. 1A). Then, we investigated the expression of DKK4 in the TCGA dataset and found that the expression of DKK4 was significantly increased in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted in three independent CRC tissue microarrays containing 293 cancer lesions. We found that the DKK4 staining intensity was significantly increased in 229 paired primary CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 1, C and D). There were no significant differences in sex, age, tumor location, or clinical stage between the high and medium-low DKK4 expression groups (Table S2). Kaplan‒Meier analysis indicated that the survival of CRC patients in the high DKK4 group was longer than that of patients in the medium-low DKK4 expression group (Fig. 1E). Further analysis showed that the DKK4 high expression group had a longer survival time than the medium-low expression group, especially in pathological grade I/II group compared to that of grade III (Fig. 1F). To further explore the roles of DKK4 in CRC, we established gain-of-function models of DKK4 in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells through lentivirus infection and established loss-of-function models of DKK4 in SW480 and HCT116 cells using a lentiviral vector carrying shRNA (Fig. 2, A and B). Transwell assays showed that DKK4 overexpression decreased the migration and invasion of Caco-2 and HCT8 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). The migration and invasion ability of Caco-2 in DKK4 overexpression group decreased to 51.9% and 31.7% respectively, compared to NC group. And the migration and invasion ability of HCT8 in DKK4 overexpression group decreased to 26.1% and 65.6%, respectively. Conversely, downregulation of DKK4 expression significantly enhanced the migration and invasion of SW480 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 2, E and F). The migration and invasion ability of SW480 in DKK4-downregulated group increased to 2.57 and 1.84 fold respectively, compared to NC group. And the migration and invasion ability of HCT116 in DKK4-downregulated group increased to 2.11 and 2.21 fold, respectively. However, DKK4 did not affect cell proliferation (Fig. 2, G and H). These results indicate that DKK4 inhibits CRC cell migration and invasion but does not influence cell proliferation in vitro. To further validate the effect of DKK4 on metastasis in vivo, HCT116-LV-shDKK4 and control cells were injected into nude mice via the tail vein. After 5 weeks, in vivo bioluminescence imaging showed that the luminescence intensities in the lungs were substantially higher in mice injected with HCT116-LV-shDKK4 cells than in mice in the control group (Fig. 3A). The luminescence intensities in the lungs were 3.7-fold in mice injected with HCT116-LV-shDKK4 cells than control group. The number of metastatic nodules in the lungs was also increased in the HCT116-LV-shDKK4 cell group (Fig. 3B). HCT116-LV-shDKK4 and the control cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to observe tumor growth. Downregulation of DKK4 expression showed no impact on the luminescence intensity, growth rate, or tumor weight between the two groups (Fig. 3, C and D). These results demonstrate that DKK4 inhibited CRC metastasis in vivo but exhibited no effect on tumorigenesis. To investigate the underlying mechanism by which DKK4 inhibits tumor metastasis in CRC, we performed RNA-seq to identify potential DKK4-regulated molecules. Using a twofold expression change as a cut-off value for differentially expressed genes, we found that 18 genes were significantly upregulated and 24 genes were significantly downregulated at the mRNA level after DKK4 knockdown in HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A). The enrichment analysis of signal pathways indicated that the main enrichment were in PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig. 4B). Among them, AKT2, FZD6, and JUN, which play important roles in AKT and Wnt signaling (14Fang D. Hawke D. Zheng Y. Xia Y. Meisenhelder J.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 4042-4045Google Scholar), were significantly increased. qRT‒PCR and Western blot confirmed that AKT2, FZD6, and JUN expression levels were decreased after DKK4 overexpression in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells and increased after DKK4 knockdown in SW480 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 4, C–F). Western blot analysis indicated that overexpression of DKK4 in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells led to a great decrease in the total expression and phosphorylation of AKT2. Both active AKT1 and AKT2 were able to phosphorylate β-catenin at Ser552 (17Dong J. Xu X. Zhang Q. Yuan Z. Tan B. The PI3K/AKT pathway promotes fracture healing through its crosstalk with wnt/β-catenin.Exp. Cell Res. 2020; 394: 112137Google Scholar). As expected, active β-catenin, phospho-β-catenin Ser552, MMP2, and MMP3 were also decreased in DKK4-overexpressing Caco-2 and HCT8 cells (Fig. 4G). In contrast, the expression levels of total and phosphorylated AKT2, active β-catenin, and s552-β-catenin as well as MMP2 and MMP3, the downstream target genes of AKT and Wnt signaling, were significantly increased when DKK4 was knocked down in HCT116 and SW480 cells (Fig. 4G). However, the expression of total β-catenin, AKT1, LRP5, and LRP6 showed no significant difference between DKK4 upregulated or downregulated cells and control cells (Fig. 4G). The antimetastatic effect of DKK4 seems paradoxical to its upregulation in CRC. We thus examined the cause of DKK4 upregulation in CRC cells. Since DKK4 inhibits Wnt signaling activity and DKK4 has been reported to be a transcriptional target of Wnt signaling (10Krupnik V.E. Sharp J.D. Jiang C. Robison K. Chickering T.W. Amaravadi L. et al.Functional and structural diversity of the human Dickkopf gene family.Gene. 1999; 238: 301-313Google Scholar, 18Sun S. Yu M. Fan Z. Yeh I. Feng H. Liu H. et al.DLX3 regulates osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells via wnt/β-catenin pathway mediated histone methylation of DKK4.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2019; 516: 171-176Google Scholar), we hypothesized that DKK4 represents a feedback mechanism of aberrant activation of Wnt signaling in the development of CRC. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated CRC cell lines with recombinant human Wnt3a (rhWnt3a), which is an important ligand of Wnt signaling. We found that upon stimulation with rhWnt3a, DKK4 mRNA expression was significantly increased at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 5A). As LiCl is the Wnt agonist, we stimulated cell lines with LiCl and found that the expression of DKK4 was significantly increased at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 5B). However, no change was observed when cells were stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Fig. 5C). These data suggested that DKK4 overexpression in CRC might be a feedback loop of Wnt signaling triggered by growth factors in the microenvironment, such as Wnt3a. These results suggest that Wnt3a induced DKK4 expression and that DKK4 inhibited CRC progression by decreasing the activities of AKT and Wnt signaling. Low DKK4 expression correlated with poor survival in CRC patients (Fig. 1E). miRNAs are important regulators that repress gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. We next investigated whether DKK4 was regulated by miRNAs. To this end, bioinformatics prediction was used to identify potential miRNAs that target DKK4. The miRWalk database identified that miR-299-3p, miR-450b-5p, miR-106a, miR-203, miR-129-5p, and miR-507 may bind to the DKK4 3′-UTR sequence. Among these miRNAs, miR-299-3p, miR-450b-5p, and miR-106a, which were reported to be involved in tumorigenesis (19Dang S. Zhou J. Wang Z. Wang K. Dai S. He S. MiR-299-3p functions as a tumor suppressor via targeting sirtuin 5 in hepatocellular carcinoma.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2018; 106: 966-975Google Scholar, 20Huang W. Shi G. Yong Z. Li J. Qiu J.

Wang X. Zhou X. Jia J. Chen H. Zhao W. miR-106a regulates cell proliferation and autophagy by targeting LKB1 in HPV-16-associated cervical cancer.Mol. Cancer Res. 2020; 18: 1129-1141Google Scholar), ranked in the top three calculated by both the total context ++ score and aggregated preferentially conserved targeting algorithms. Mimics of the three miRNAs were transfected into SW480 and HCT116 cells. qRT‒PCR and Western blot confirmed that miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p inhibited DKK4 expression (Fig. 6A). Inhibitors of miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p were transfected into Caco-2 and HCT8 cells. qRT‒PCR and Western blot confirmed that lower miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p levels increased DKK4 expression (Fig. S1A). To assess whether miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p directly bind to the 3′-UTR of DKK4, we performed dual-luciferase reporter assays. Both miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p affected the luciferase activity of the DKK4 WT 3′-UTR reporter construct, whereas this effect was abolished by the introduction of a mutation into the miR-299-3p- or miR-450b-5p-binding sequence, respectively (Figs. 6, B and C and S1B). These results indicate that miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p downregulate DKK4 expression by directly targeting its 3′-UTR. To verify whether DKK4 is the functional target of miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p, we overexpressed miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p in SW480 and HCT116 cells, inhibited their levels in Caco-2 and HCT8 cells, and examined their effects on migration and invasion. Transwell assays revealed that miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p overexpression promoted the migration and invasion of SW480 and HCT116 cells (Figs. 6D and S1C). Conversely, their downregulation decreased the migration and invasion of Caco-2 and HCT8 cells (Figs. S1D and 6E). Furthermore, we cotransfected the DKK4-3′-UTR-overexpressing plasmid and miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p mimic in HCT8 and Caco-2 cells. We found that transfection of miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p into DKK4-overexpressing cells abrogated the inhibitory effect of DKK4 on migration and invasion (Figs. 6F and S1E). We also found that miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p expression was inversely correlated with DKK4 levels in nine paired primary CRC tissues and their adjacent normal tissues (Fig. S1F). These findings suggest that DKK4 in CRC is regulated by miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p. In the present study, we found that DKK4 expression was significantly upregulated in primary and metastatic CRC tissues compared with adjacent tissues. Several studies reported the upregulation of DKK4 in CRC cells and tissues (7Niehrs C. Function and biological roles of the Dickkopf family of Wnt modulators.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Google Scholar), but they included limited cell lines and tissue samples. Our studies confirmed the upregulation of DKK4 in CRC by enrolling 23 CRC cell lines and tissue microarrays containing 229 CRC cases in total. DKK4 expression was closely correlated with poor prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (22Hu Y. Liu M. Xu S. Li S. Yang M. Su T. et al.The clinical significance of Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor gene family in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Med. Sci. Monit. 2020; 26: e927368Google Scholar, 23Wang M. Ni B. Zhuang C. Zhao W.Y. Tu L. Ma X.L. et al.Aberrant accumulation of Dickkopf 4 promotes tumor progression via forming the immune suppressive microenvironment in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.Cancer Med. 2019; 8: 5352-5366Google Scholar). However, there have been no studies on DKK4 expression in correlation with the prognosis of CRC patients. In our study, we found that high DKK4 expression is correlated with prolonged survival in colorectal cancer patients. The DKK4 high expression group had a longer survival time than the medium-low expression group, especially in pathological grade I/II group compared to that of grade III. The dysregulation of DKK4 plays a significant role in the process of initiation and metastasis in various cancer types. Studies have demonstrated the tumor-promoting role of DKK4 in renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. In contrast, DKK4 is commonly considered a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal cancers such as liver cancer and gastric cancer. These data indicate a cell- or tissue-context function of DKK4 in malignant cancer progression (7Niehrs C. Function and biological roles of the Dickkopf family of Wnt modulators.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Google Scholar). In CRC, previous studies revealed that DKK4 increased angiogenic potential but showed a controversial role in cell migration (24He S. Shen J. Hu N. Xu X. Li J. DKK4 enhances resistance to chemotherapeutics 5-fu and YN968D1 in colorectal cancer cells.Oncol. Lett. 2017; 13: 587-592Google Scholar). Our work indicated the tumor suppressive role of DKK4 in CRC metastasis and showed that DKK4 had no effect on cell proliferation. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway in embryonic development, and its aberrant activation is tightly linked with the malignant progression of many human cancers (25Yu F. Yu C. Li F. Zuo Y. Wang Y. Yao L. et al.Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancers and targeted therapies.Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2021; 6: 307Google Scholar). Previous study indicated that cells with mutations in APC or β-catenin still depend on Wnt ligands and their secretion for a sufficient level of β-catenin signaling (26Voloshanenko O. Erdmann G. Dubash T.D. Augustin I. Metzig M. Moffa G. et al.Wnt secretion is required to maintain high levels of Wnt activity in colon cancer cells.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2610Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with this report and we provide evidence that DKK4 functions in multiple CRC cell lines with different genetic background. DKK family members such as DKK1 and DKK2 have been shown to bind LRP5/6 with high affinities and inhibit their expression (7Niehrs C. Function and biological roles of the Dickkopf family of Wnt modulators.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7469-7481Google Scholar), but we did not find any change of LRP5/6 expression after DKK4 inhibition, indicating DKK4 does not function through inhibiting LRP5/6. To explore the further mechanism, the enrichment analysis of signal pathways from RNA-seq data indicated that the main enrichment were in PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways. Among them, qRT‒PCR and Western blot analysis confirmed that FZD6, AKT2, and JUN showed significant changes after DKK4 knockdown in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines, whereas other molecules such as CTNNA1 exhibited no obvious change. FZD6 is known as an upstream receptor for Wnt protein in β-catenin signaling activation， which can promote CRC progression through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (27Xu C. Tian G. Jiang C. Xue H. Kuerbanjiang M. Sun L. et al.NPTX2 promotes colorectal cancer growth and liver metastasis by the activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway via FZD6.Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10: 217Google Scholar). AKT phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser552 to induce the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus and enhance its transcriptional activity (14Fang D. Hawke D. Zheng Y. Xia Y. Meisenhelder J. Nika H. et al.Phosphorylation of beta-catenin by AKT promotes beta-catenin transcriptional activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11221-11229Google Scholar, 28He X.C. Yin T. Grindley J.C. Tian Q. Sato T. Tao W.A. et al.PTEN-deficient intestinal stem cells initiate intestinal polyposis.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 189-198Google Scholar). c-Jun is a nuclear protein, which might be involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and act downstream of β-catenin stabilization (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Xi Y. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li L. Nuclear Dvl, c-Jun, β-catenin, and TCF form a complex leading to stabiLization of β-catenin–TCF interaction.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1087-1100Google Scholar). We found that DKK4 suppress the Wnt/β-catenin pathway not only by directly inhibiting FZD6 expression but also by inhibiting the expression of AKT2 and phospho-AKT2, leading to the suppression of ser552 β-catenin. Metalloproteinases are target genes of the Wnt/β-catenin and AKT pathways. We further confirmed that DKK4 could inhibit the expression of MMP2 and MMP3. Paradoxically, why is DKK4 increased in the CRC metastasis setting, while it plays an inhibitory role on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway? We found that rhWnt3a and LiCl could increase DKK4 expression. Since Wnt3a is an abundant growth factor in the CRC tumor microenvironment that is conducive to metastasis, this finding provides a rationale for why DKK4 is upregulated in tumors but plays a suppressive role. Altogether, our study indicated that rhWnt3a or LiCl increases DKK4 expression, while overexpressed DKK4 in turn suppresses Wnt signaling, forming a negative feedback loop to limit overactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC. miRNAs are important epigenetic regulators that modulate the expression of critical cancer-related genes and thereby function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (30Kong Y.W. Ferland-McCollough D. Jackson T.J. Bushell M. MicroRNAs in cancer management.Lancet Oncol. 2012; 13: e249-e258Google Scholar). To date, no studies have reported specific miRNAs that regulate the expression of DKK4. In this study, we employed bioinformatics analyses and subsequent experiments to identify the regulatory miRNAs of DKK4 in CRC cells. MiR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p were predicted and demonstrated to target DKK4, and an inverse correlation was observed between miR-450-5p or miR-299-3p and DKK4 in CRC tissues. The decreased metastatic ability caused by overexpression of DKK4 was partially eliminated by the ectopic expression of miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p. Overall, our results showed that miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p directly targeted DKK4 in CRC. In summary, we found for the first time that DKK4 is upregulated in CRC but plays a suppressive role in tumor metastasis. Regarding the mechanism, we identified a novel Wnt3a/DKK4/AKT/s552 β-catenin negative feedback regulatory axis that may limit Wnt signaling from overactivation in CRC. Additionally, we found that the expression of DKK4 was regulated by miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p. These results suggest that DKK4 serves as a promising prognostic marker and that the restoration of DKK4 expression may be an effective strategy for the treatment of CRC. The human CRC cell lines LoVo, COLO205, SW1463, T84, HCT8, COLO-320DM, Caco-2, SW48, HT29, DiFi, SW837, KM12C, KM12sm, V9P, SK-CO-1, LS123, HCT116, HuTu80, SW948, SW630, SW1116, LS174, and SW480 and the human normal colonic epithelial cell lines FHC and 293T were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The origin and mutation status of the Caco-2, HCT8, SW480, and HCT116 cell lines are shown in Table S1. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% MEM nonessential amino acids (Gibco) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The complete medium used for culturing CC-CR cells contained 3 μg/ml cetuximab (Merck). Three colorectal cancer tissue microarrays (HCoLA180Su10, HCoLA180Su15, and HCoLA180Su17) were purchased from the Outdo Biotech Company, which includes 229 paired human CRC tissues and the corresponding adjacent nontumorous colorectal tissues and in addition, 64 cases only with primary cancer lesions. Nine primary CRC and matched adjacent normal tissue samples were collected from patients who underwent CRC surgery at Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were clinically and pathologically confirmed to be correctly labeled. All patients provided informed consent, and this study was approved by Xijing Hospital’s Protection of Human Subjects Committee. IHC staining for DKK4 was performed on tissue microarrays. The tissue microarrays were first baked on a 65 °C toaster for 2.5 h, deparaffinized, subjected to antigen retrieval with sodium citrate buffer at a pH of 6.0 and endogenous peroxidase inactivation, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-human DKK4 primary antibody (Abcam). The slides were then incubated with secondary antibodies and visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride plus. The IHC scoring criteria were as follows: “positive staining rate” score: ≤1% (0), 2 to 25% (1), 26 to 50% (2), 51 to 75% (3), and ≥75% (4); “staining intensity” score: negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3); and histological score = intensity score × percentage score. An overall score of 0 to 12 was graded as negative (−, score: 0), weak (+, score: 1–4), moderate (++, score: 5–8), or strong (+++, score: 9–12). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and surgically resected fresh-frozen CRC tissues with QIAzol Reagent and purified using a miRNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For miRNA detection, total RNA was used for complementary DNA synthesis with a TaqMan miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). For mRNA detection, total RNA was reverse transcribed with a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen), and the double-stranded cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR by SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara). Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara) with the CFX96 QPCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The primers specific to mature miR-450b-5p and miR-299-3p were purchased from RiboBio. The primers for the other genes of interest were synthesized by Takara. U6 and GAPDH were used as internal controls for miRNA and DKK4, respectively. The 2−ΔΔCT method was used to determine the fold changes in the mRNA levels between each sample and the reference sample. The PCR primers were as follows: DKK4-forward 5′-AAGCCGTTCTGTGCTACATG-3′, DKK4-reverse 5′-CTTTTGGGTTGGTTTTCCTG-3′ and GAPDH-forward 5′-GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-3′, GAPDH-reverse 5′-TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGG A-3′. Cultured CRC cells were lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer (Beyotime) supplemented with a protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Protein lysates were separated by SDS‒PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were sequentially blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST (150 mM NaCl, 120 mM Tris–HCl, pH of 7.4, and 0.05% Tween 20), incubated with primary antibodies, and incubated with secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). The antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-human DKK4 (Abcam), mouse anti-human β-actin (Sigma‒Aldrich), rabbit anti-human β-catenin, rabbit anti-human nonphospho (active)-β-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41), rabbit anti-human phospho-β-catenin (Ser552), rabbit anti-human AKT1, AKT2, phospho-AKT2, FZD6, JUN, LRP5, LRP6, MMP2, and MMP3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (ZSGB). β-actin was used as an internal control. The immunoreactive protein complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ZETA) and scanned by the Molecular Imager ChemiDox XRS+ Imaging System with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). Small interfering RNAs against DKK4 (siDKK4), mimics of miR-450b-5p, miR-299-3p and corresponding control oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized by GenePharma. Inhibitors of miR-450b-5p, miR-299-3p, and corresponding control oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized by RIBOBIO. DKK4 siDKK4#1 5′-UUUCUGGUAUUGCAGUCCGTT-3′, siDKK4#2 5′-UGAUUUCUUAAUACUUGGCTT-3′, siDKK4#3 5′-UUUAUGCCCUCUUCUGGAGTT-3′, and the negative control siRNA 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3′ were transfected into HCT116 and SW480 cells, and HCT116 and SW480 cells were transfected with miR-299-3p and miR-450b-5p mimics and a scrambled negative control miRNA. Transfection of the siRNAs and miRNA mimics was performed using DharmaFECT transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lentivirus carrying the human DKK4 gene (LV-DKK4) was purchased from Genepharma, and short hairpin RNA targeting DKK4 (LV-shDKK4) was purchased from GeneChem. An empty lentiviral vector was used as a negative control. After 48 h of infection, CRC cells were screened with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (MP Biomedicals) for 2 weeks to obtain cell lines with stable infection. Treated cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 103 per well in 96-well plates. After incubation for 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h, a cell counting kit-8 assay (Dojindo) was utilized to examine cell proliferation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cell migration and invasion capabilities were assessed by transwell assay with 8-μm pore, 24-well transwell plates (Corning). For the migration assays, 10 × 105 Caco-2 LV-DKK4, HCT8 LV-DKK4, HCT116-LV-shDKK4, SW480 LV-shDKK4, or corresponding negative control cells were seeded in the top chamber lined with an uncoated membrane (Millipore). In the invasion experiment, 10 × 105 of the aforementioned cells were plated in the upper chamber coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for an appropriate duration, cells that had migrated or invaded through the membrane were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and counted under a microscope (Olympus) to determine their relative numbers. Female nude mice aged 4 to 6 weeks were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University and housed in pathogen-free conditions. Animal studies were approved by the Fourth Military Medical University Animal Care Committee. All mice were randomized into groups. Luciferase-labeled HCT116-LV-shDKK4 and negative control cells were used in subcutaneous xenograft and tail vein metastasis assays. For in vivo tumorigenicity assays, the abovementioned cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in PBS. A total of 5 × 106 cells in 200 μl of PBS were subcutaneously injected into the right flanks of mice (n = 5). The tumor volumes were measured every 3 days. Mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks, and the subcutaneous tumors were dissected for histological examination. For in vivo metastasis assays, a total of 1 × 106 cells in 200 μl of PBS were injected via the tail vein into nude mice (n = 5). Five weeks after injection, the bioluminescence intensity was evaluated using the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (PerkinElmer). Eight weeks after injection, the mice were euthanized, and the lung metastases were dissected for further histological examination. The indicated cells cultured in 24-well plates were cotransfected with miR-450b-5p or miR-299-3p mimic or negative control and the indicated WT or mutant psiCHECK2-3′UTR plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were collected and lysed for luciferase assays 48 h after transfection. A dual-luciferase assay (Promega) was used to quantify the luciferase activity. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and presented as the relative luciferase activity. All assays were performed in triplicate. These Caco-2, HCT8, SW480, and HCT116 cell lines were cultured serum-free for 24 h. Recombinant human rhWnt3a (50 ng/ml) or LiCl (20 mmol/l) or HGF (50 ng/ml) was added in Caco-2, HCT8, SW480 cell lines, and cells at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h were removed and rinsed with PBS. Then, QIAzol was added to extract RNA. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; https://cancergenome.nih.gov) datasets were used to detect the expression of DKK4 mRNA in human cancer specimens and normal tissues. Data collected from at least three independent experiments were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 software. Normally distributed data and non-normally distributed data are presented as the mean ± SEM, and Student’s unpaired t test and the Mann‒Whitney U test were used for comparisons between two groups, respectively. Classification data were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Frequencies of categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to assess mutual associations among clinical results. p < 0.05 was considered representative of a significant difference (∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W4298009040,"Proteolytic cascades comprise several important physiological systems, including a primary arm of innate immunity called the complement cascade. To safeguard against complement-mediated attack, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, Borreliella burgdorferi, produces numerous outer surface–localized lipoproteins that contribute to successful complement evasion. Recently, we discovered a pair of B. burgdorferi surface lipoproteins of the OspEF-related protein family—termed ElpB and ElpQ—that inhibit antibody-mediated complement activation. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanism of ElpB and ElpQ complement inhibition using an array of biochemical and biophysical approaches. In vitro assays of complement activation show that an independently folded homologous C-terminal domain of each Elp protein maintains full complement inhibitory activity and selectively inhibits the classical pathway. Using binding assays and complement component C1s enzyme assays, we show that binding of Elp proteins to activated C1s blocks complement component C4 cleavage by competing with C1s–C4 binding without occluding the active site. C1s-mediated C4 cleavage is dependent on activation-induced binding sites, termed exosites. To test whether these exosites are involved in Elp–C1s binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis, which showed that ElpB and ElpQ binding require C1s residues in the anion-binding exosite located on the serine protease domain of C1s. Based on these results, we propose a model whereby ElpB and ElpQ exploit activation-induced conformational changes that are normally important for C1s-mediated C4 cleavage. Our study expands the known complement evasion mechanisms of microbial pathogens and reveals a novel molecular mechanism for selective C1s inhibition by Lyme disease spirochetes.

Complement system part II: role in immunity.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 257Google Scholar, 3Walport M.J. Complement. First of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Google Scholar, 4Walport M.J. Complement. Second of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1140-1144Google Scholar). Pattern recognition proteins of the complement system detect molecular signatures at the microbial surface and start a series of proteolytic reactions that convert inert complement components into bioactive protein fragments. A self-amplification loop involving cleavage of complement component C3 quickly leads to labeling of the activating surface with the central opsonin of the cascade (i.e., C3b), release of powerful chemoattractants known as anaphylatoxins (i.e., C3a and C5a), and formation of a pore-like complex called the membrane attack complex (i.e., C5b-9), which can directly kill susceptible microbes (1Merle N.S. Church S.E. Fremeaux-Bacchi V. Roumenina L.T. Complement system part I - molecular mechanisms of activation and regulation.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 262Google Scholar, 2Merle N.S. Noe R.

There are three primary mechanisms by which the complement cascade initiates, and these serve as the basis for three canonical pathways, known as the classical pathway (CP), lectin pathway (LP), and the alternative pathway (AP) (1Merle N.S. Church S.E. Fremeaux-Bacchi V. Roumenina L.T. Complement system part I - molecular mechanisms of activation and regulation.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 262Google Scholar, 2Merle N.S. Noe R.

The CP is initiated by a multiprotein complex termed the first component of complement, C1, which is made up of a pattern recognition protein (C1q), and two homologous serine proteases (SPs; C1r and C1s), arranged as a heterotetramer (i.e., C1qr2s2). The C1 complex primarily recognizes antibody-bound antigens leading to autoactivation of C1r, followed by C1r cleavage of C1s. Activated C1s then specifically cleaves complement component C2 and C4, promoting the formation of the central enzyme complexes of the complement cascade on the activating surface, known as C3 and C5 convertases. These complexes act to convert complement components C3 and C5 into active fragments, leading to the downstream effector functions of complement. The LP is initiated by recognition of foreign carbohydrate structures by mannan-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins, and certain collectins, which recruit MBL-associated serine proteases, which like C1s, cleave C2 and C4. Thus, the CP and LP intersect at the CP–LP C3 convertase (i.e., C4b2b) causing proteolytic activation of C3 and ultimately, of C5. In contrast, the AP is initiated spontaneously under a continuous low-level solution reaction known as tick over that can lead to the direct formation of the AP C3 convertases (i.e., C3bBb) on nearby unprotected surfaces. In addition to acting as the initiating enzyme for the AP, the AP C3 convertase establishes a self-amplification loop for all three pathways that results in large amounts of C3 activation, and deposition of C3b on the activating surface. Proteolytic cascades like the complement system underly several important physiological systems including hemostasis and innate immune defense. Central to these cascades are the activities of a relatively small set of SPs that must act on a restricted set of substrates at the right time and in the right location. A common mechanism for control of proteolytic cascades is the production of an initial protease form that has very low catalytic activity, known interchangeably as a proenzyme or a zymogen. Zymogen proteases must themselves be proteolytically cleaved in order to become fully active enzymes. This zymogen conversion event leads to conformational changes in the protease that allow for productive interactions with the appropriate substrate. These changes include formation of pockets on the protease, known as subsites, which bind directly to residues of a specific peptide sequence in a substrate scissile loop (5Schechter I. Berger A. On the size of the active site in proteases. I. Papain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar). In some cases, including the complement SP C1s, it has been shown that zymogen conversion results in conformational changes outside the active site leading to formation of what are known as exosites (6Duncan R.C. Mohlin F. Taleski D. Coetzer T.H. Huntington J.A. Payne R.J. et al.Identification of a catalytic exosite for complement component C4 on the serine protease domain of C1s.J.

Crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human complement c1s: a serine protease with a handle.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1755-1765Google Scholar). Exosites are critical for mediating contact with large protein substrates, such as C4 (205 kDa), in the case of C1s (6Duncan R.C. Mohlin F. Taleski D. Coetzer T.H. Huntington J.A. Payne R.J. et al.Identification of a catalytic exosite for complement component C4 on the serine protease domain of C1s.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 2365-2373Google Scholar, 7Perry A.J. Wijeyewickrema L.C.

Yatime L. et al.Structural basis for activation of the complement system by component C4 cleavage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 15425-15430Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to subsite–scissile loop interactions, exosites can provide an additional layer of substrate specificity to proteases (10Bock P.E. Panizzi P. Verhamme I.M.A. Exosites in the substrate specificity of blood coagulation reactions.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5 Suppl 1: 81-94Google Scholar). However, the conformational changes associated with zymogen activation and exosite formation also provide a potential opportunity for highly selective intervention of proteolytic cascades by therapeutic agents—or less desirably—by microbial pathogens. C1s consists of six sequentially arranged domains beginning with an N-terminal complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1 (CUB) domain (CUB1), followed by an epidermal growth factor–like domain, a second CUB domain (CUB2), a complement control protein (CCP) domain (CCP1), a second CCP domain (CCP2), and the C-terminal catalytic SP domain. C4 binds to the C-terminal domains of C1s (i.e., CCP1–CCP2–SP) using three primary binding sites: (i) C1s subsites that interact with the C4 scissile loop, (ii) an exosite on the SP domain known as the anion-binding exosite (ABE) that is predicted to bind sulfotyrosine residues on C4, and (iii) a second exosite at the hinge region between CCP1–CCP2 known as the CCP exosite (CCPE) that is predicted to bind to the C345C domain of C4 (6Duncan R.C. Mohlin F. Taleski D. Coetzer T.H. Huntington J.A. Payne R.J. et al.Identification of a catalytic exosite for complement component C4 on the serine protease domain of C1s.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 2365-2373Google Scholar, 7Perry A.J. Wijeyewickrema L.C. Wilmann P.G. Gunzburg M.J. D’Andrea L. Irving J.A. et al.A molecular switch governs the interaction between the human complement protease C1s and its substrate, complement C4.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15821-15829Google Scholar, 9Kidmose R.T. Laursen N.S. Dobó J. Kjaer T.R. Sirotkina S. Yatime L. et al.Structural basis for activation of the complement system by component C4 cleavage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 15425-15430Google Scholar). Importantly, the mechanism of C1s-mediated C4 cleavage has been shown to rely on a “molecular switch,” whereby zymogen activation of C1s results in conformational rearrangement leading to the formation of the C4-binding sites in the activated form of the protease (7Perry A.J. Wijeyewickrema L.C. Wilmann P.G. Gunzburg M.J. D’Andrea L. Irving J.A. et al.A molecular switch governs the interaction between the human complement protease C1s and its substrate, complement C4.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15821-15829Google Scholar). This model is further supported by a crystal structure of activated MBL-associated SP-2 in complex with C4, and C1s mutagenesis of four positively charged residues within the ABE (i.e., K575, R576, R581, and K583) (6Duncan R.C. Mohlin F. Taleski D. Coetzer T.H. Huntington J.A. Payne R.J. et al.Identification of a catalytic exosite for complement component C4 on the serine protease domain of C1s.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 2365-2373Google Scholar, 7Perry A.J. Wijeyewickrema L.C. Wilmann P.G. Gunzburg M.J. D’Andrea L. Irving J.A. et al.A molecular switch governs the interaction between the human complement protease C1s and its substrate, complement C4.J. Biol.

Yatime L. et al.Structural basis for activation of the complement system by component C4 cleavage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 15425-15430Google Scholar). Thus, C4 cleavage by C1s is controlled, in part, by exosite formation on C1r-cleaved forms of the C1s protease. Activation of complement is proinflammatory and is thus under tight control by proteins that are themselves part of the complement system, known as regulators of complement activity (11Schmidt C.Q. Lambris J.D. Ricklin D. Protection of host cells by complement regulators.Immunol. Rev. 2016; 274: 152-171Google Scholar, 12Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Complement in immune and inflammatory disorders: therapeutic interventions.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 3839-3847Google Scholar). Microbial pathogens are also under pressure to evade complement recognition, and a wide range of microbial complement evasion mechanisms have been described for medically important microbes including bacterial pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borreliella burgdorferi (13Lambris J.D. Ricklin D. Geisbrecht B.V. Complement evasion by human pathogens.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 132-142Google Scholar, 14Garcia B.L. Zwarthoff S.A. Rooijakkers S.H.M. Geisbrecht B.V. Novel evasion mechanisms of the classical complement pathway.J. Immunol. 2016; 197: 2051-2060Google Scholar). Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that is estimated to cause nearly half a million infections per year in the United States (15Kugeler K.J. Schwartz A.M. Delorey M.J. Mead P.S. Hinckley A.F. Estimating the frequency of Lyme disease diagnoses, United States, 2010-2018.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2021; 27: 616-619Google Scholar), many of which manifest in immunocompetent individuals. B. burgdorferi has evolved a myriad of host immune evasion strategies, including a large anticomplement arsenal in the form of outer surface–localized lipoproteins (16Skare J.T. Garcia B.L. Complement evasion by Lyme disease spirochetes.Trends Microbiol. 2020; 28: 889-899Google Scholar, 17Coburn J. Garcia B. Hu L.T. Jewett M.W. Kraiczy P. Norris S.J. et al.Lyme disease pathogenesis.Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2021; 42: 473-518Google Scholar). Amazingly, over 10% of the surface lipoproteome of B. burgdorferi has been shown to interact directly with components of the complement system (16Skare J.T. Garcia B.L. Complement evasion by Lyme disease spirochetes.Trends Microbiol. 2020; 28: 889-899Google Scholar), and this percentage is even greater if one considers only the lipoproteins that are expressed during the vertebrate phase of infection. Thus, the Lyme disease spirochete has emerged as an important model to study evasion of the complement proteolytic cascade by microbial pathogens (16Skare J.T. Garcia B.L. Complement evasion by Lyme disease spirochetes.Trends Microbiol. 2020; 28: 889-899Google Scholar). While a majority of these B. burgdorferi lipoproteins function by recruiting the endogenous complement regulator factor H to the bacterial surface (18Kraiczy P. Stevenson B.

Using a surface lipoproteome library (32Dowdell A.S. Murphy M.D. Azodi C. Swanson S.K. Florens L. Chen S. et al.Comprehensive spatial analysis of the Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteome reveals a compartmentalization bias toward the bacterial surface.J. Bacteriol. 2017; 199E00658Google Scholar), we recently identified a new player in the B. burgdorferi complement evasion system in the form of two paralogous outer surface lipoproteins of the OspE/F-related protein family, termed ElpB and ElpQ (31Pereira M.J.

Genes encoding Elps are located on 32-kilobase circular plasmids (i.e., cp32 genetic elements) and are expressed during the mammalian phase of infection, suggesting a potential role in host interaction, which is further supported by the identification of laminin as a binding partner for ErpX–ElpX (35Marconi R.T.

Borrelia burgdorferi Erp proteins are immunogenic in mammals infected by tick bite, and their synthesis is inducible in cultured bacteria.Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2648-2654Google Scholar). We showed that ElpB and ElpQ bound with high affinity to the CP proteases C1r and C1s and were selective for the activated forms of each protease (31Pereira M.J. Wager B. Garrigues R.J. Gerlach E. Quinn J.D. Dowdell A.S. et al.Lipoproteome screening of the Lyme disease agent identifies inhibitors of antibody-mediated complement killing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2117770119Google Scholar). Unlike BBK32, binding of activated C1r did not directly block its cleavage of zymogen C1s. Instead, we found that ElpB and ElpQ block the CP by binding directly to C1s and inhibiting cleavage of its two natural substrates, C2 and C4 (31Pereira M.J. Wager B. Garrigues R.J. Gerlach E. Quinn J.D. Dowdell A.S. et al.Lipoproteome screening of the Lyme disease agent identifies inhibitors of antibody-mediated complement killing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2117770119Google Scholar). Along with B. burgdorferi BBK32, which binds and inhibits both zymogen and active forms of C1r (28Garcia B.L. Zhi H. Wager B. Höök M. Skare J.T. Borrelia burgdorferi BBK32 inhibits the classical pathway by blocking activation of the C1 complement complex.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12e1005404Google Scholar), ElpB and ElpQ may protect Lyme disease spirochetes from antibody-mediated complement killing during host infection. However, the molecular mechanism by which ElpB and ElpQ block the CP remains poorly understood. In this study, we set out to elucidate a specific mechanism that explains how the Elp–C1s interaction leads to selective CP blockade. We have previously shown that residues 19 to 378 of ElpB and residues 19 to 343 of ElpQ, which constitute the mature proteins lacking the secretion and lipidation sequences, prevent the deposition of C4b in a serum-based ELISA that utilizes immunoglobulin M as a specific activator of the CP (31Pereira M.J. Wager B. Garrigues R.J. Gerlach E. Quinn J.D. Dowdell A.S. et al.Lipoproteome screening of the Lyme disease agent identifies inhibitors of antibody-mediated complement killing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2117770119Google Scholar). To determine if this inhibitory activity could be isolated to a specific region of the Elp proteins, we designed, produced, and purified a set of 12 truncation mutants of ElpB and ElpQ. Each of these mutants were tested for their ability to dose-dependently inhibit in the CP ELISA assay. An initial set of truncation mutants divided ElpQ into N-terminal residues 19 to 216 and C-terminal residues 217 to 343; however, both proteins failed to inhibit complement (Fig. 1A, green circles and teal circles, respectively). Interestingly, truncations involving longer C-terminal regions (residues 103–343, 168–343, and 181–343) all retained full-length–like ElpQ inhibitory activities, as judged by IC50 values (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Similarly, ElpB C-terminal truncation constructs composed of residues 111 to 378, 138 to 378, and 182 to 378 exhibited IC50 values similar to that of full-length ElpB (Fig. 1B and Table 1). As was observed for ElpQ, shorter C-terminal ElpB constructs lost all activity (i.e., residues 243–378 and 288–378). Constructs for ElpB (residues 138–288) and ElpQ (residues 168–328) that removed 90 and 15 residues from the C termini of ElpB and ElpQ, respectively, produced inhibitors with weaker relative inhibitory activities (Fig. 1, A and B and Table 1). This analysis defined a homologous C-terminal domain of ElpB and ElpQ that retains full complement inhibitory activities (i.e., ElpB182–378 and ElpQ181–343) (Figs. 1C and S1, A and B). CD spectra were obtained for these inhibitory fragments as well as their full-length counterparts. These experiments indicate that each protein is folded and has strong alpha helical character (Fig. S2, A–D). As further evidence that these constructs retained full inhibitory activity, ElpQ181–343 and ElpB182–378 dose-dependently inhibited hemolysis of opsonized rabbit erythrocytes, indicating that they prevent the downstream CP-mediated formation of the membrane attack complex as demonstrated previously for full-length proteins (31Pereira M.J. Wager B. Garrigues R.J. Gerlach E. Quinn J.D. Dowdell A.S. et al.Lipoproteome screening of the Lyme disease agent identifies inhibitors of antibody-mediated complement killing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2022; 119e2117770119Google Scholar) (Fig. S2E). Importantly, the inhibitory activity of both full-length and truncated Elp proteins was selective for the CP (Fig. 1, D and E). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that an independently folding domain at the C terminus of ElpB and ElpQ selectively inhibits the CP in a manner similar to that of the full-length proteins.Table 1CP ELISA IC50 values and confidence intervalsElpQ proteinsIC50 (nM)95% CI (nM)ElpB proteinsIC50 (nM)95% CI (nM)ElpQ19–343480420–550ElpB19–378320280–370ElpQ19–216NDNDElpB111–378280230–330ElpQ103–343180150–220ElpB138–28815001100–2300ElpQ168–32830002000–5900ElpB138–378300220–430ElpQ168–343590460–780ElpB182–378290250–330ElpQ181–343210170–260ElpB243–378NDNDElpQ217–343NDNDElpB288–378NDNDCI, confidence interval; ND, not determined.

U. S. A. 2022; 119e2117770119Google Scholar). To test if the minimal inhibitory fragments of ElpB and ElpQ retained high-affinity binding to activated C1s, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Biosensors were generated by immobilizing ElpB182–378 and ElpQ181–343 on an SPR sensor chip, and purified activated C1s enzyme was titrated over each surface. The resulting sensorgrams were used to calculate equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) by fitting the data to a steady state (KD, ss) and a kinetic"
https://openalex.org/W4298394659,"Amino acid restriction has recently emerged as a compelling strategy to inhibit tumor growth. Recent work suggests that amino acids can regulate cellular signaling in addition to their role as biosynthetic substrates. Using lymphoid cancer cells as a model, we found that asparagine depletion acutely reduces the expression of c-MYC protein without changing its mRNA expression. Furthermore, asparagine depletion inhibits the translation of MYC mRNA without altering the rate of MYC protein degradation. Of interest, the inhibitory effect on MYC mRNA translation during asparagine depletion is not due to the activation of the general controlled nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) pathway and is not a consequence of the inhibition of global protein synthesis. In addition, both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of MYC mRNA are not required for this inhibitory effect. Finally, using a MYC-driven mouse B cell lymphoma model, we found that shRNA inhibition of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) or pharmacological inhibition of asparagine production can significantly reduce the MYC protein expression and tumor growth when environmental asparagine becomes limiting. Since MYC is a critical oncogene, our results uncover a molecular connection between MYC mRNA translation and asparagine bioavailability and shed light on a potential to target MYC oncogene post-transcriptionally through asparagine restriction."
https://openalex.org/W4299349500,"The response to lifestyle intervention studies is often heterogeneous, especially in older adults. Subtle responses that may represent a health gain for individuals are not always detected by classical health variables, stressing the need for novel biomarkers that detect intermediate changes in metabolic, inflammatory, and immunity-related health. Here, our aim was to develop and validate a molecular multivariate biomarker maximally sensitive to the individual effect of a lifestyle intervention; the Personalized Lifestyle Intervention Status (PLIS). We used 1 H-NMR fasting blood metabolite measurements from before and after the 13-week combined physical and nutritional Growing Old TOgether (GOTO) lifestyle intervention study in combination with a fivefold cross-validation and a bootstrapping method to train a separate PLIS score for men and women. The PLIS scores consisted of 14 and four metabolites for females and males, respectively. Performance of the PLIS score in tracking health gain was illustrated by association of the sex-specific PLIS scores with several classical metabolic health markers, such as BMI, trunk fat%, fasting HDL cholesterol, and fasting insulin, the primary outcome of the GOTO study. We also showed that the baseline PLIS score indicated which participants respond positively to the intervention. Finally, we explored PLIS in an independent physical activity lifestyle intervention study, showing similar, albeit remarkably weaker, associations of PLIS with classical metabolic health markers. To conclude, we found that the sex-specific PLIS score was able to track the individual short-term metabolic health gain of the GOTO lifestyle intervention study. The methodology used to train the PLIS score potentially provides a useful instrument to track personal responses and predict the participant's health benefit in lifestyle interventions similar to the GOTO study."
https://openalex.org/W4297537346,"Recent studies have reported that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway is activated in approximately 40% of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This led us to investigate pharmacological repression of PPARγ as a possible intervention strategy. Here, we characterize PPARγ antagonists and inverse agonists and find that the former behave as silent ligands, whereas inverse agonists (T0070907 and SR10221) repress downstream PPARγ target genes leading to growth inhibition in bladder cancer cell lines. To understand the mechanism, we determined the ternary crystal structure of PPARγ bound to T0070907 and the corepressor (co-R) peptide NCOR1. The structure shows that the AF-2 helix 12 (H12) rearranges to bind inside the ligand-binding domain, where it forms stabilizing interactions with the compound. This dramatic movement in H12 unveils a large interface for co-R binding. In contrast, the crystal structure of PPARγ bound to a SR10221 analog shows more subtle structural differences, where the compound binds and pushes H12 away from the ligand-binding domain to allow co-R binding. Interestingly, we found that both classes of compound promote recruitment of co-R proteins in biochemical assays but with distinct conformational changes in H12. We validate our structural models using both site-directed mutagenesis and chemical probes. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into pharmacological modulation of PPARγ signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4297980236,"BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian carcinoma (OC) has been shown to be particularly sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis). Furthermore, BRCA1/2 mutation status is currently used as a predictive biomarker for PARPi therapy. Despite providing a major clinical benefit to the majority of patients, a significant proportion of BRCA1/2-deficient OC tumors do not respond to PARPis for reasons that are incompletely understood. Using an integrated chemical, phospho- and ADP-ribosylation proteomics approach, we sought here to develop additional mechanism-based biomarker candidates for PARPi therapy in OC and identify new targets for combination therapy to overcome primary resistance. Using chemical proteomics with PARPi baits in a BRCA1-isogenic OC cell line pair, as well as patient-derived BRCA1-proficient and BRCA1-deficient tumor samples, and subsequent validation by coimmunoprecipitation, we showed differential PARP1 and PARP2 protein complex composition in PARPi-sensitive, BRCA1-deficient UWB1.289 (UWB) cells compared to PARPi-insensitive, BRCA1-reconstituted UWB1.289+BRCA1 (UWB+B) cells. In addition, global phosphoproteomics and ADP-ribosylation proteomics furthermore revealed that the PARPi rucaparib induced the cell cycle pathway and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway in UWB cells but downregulated ErbB signaling in UWB+B cells. In addition, we observed AKT PARylation and prosurvival AKT-mTOR signaling in UWB+B cells after PARPi treatment. Consistently, we found the synergy of PARPis with DNAPK or AKT inhibitors was more pronounced in UWB+B cells, highlighting these pathways as actionable vulnerabilities. In conclusion, we demonstrate the combination of chemical proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and ADP-ribosylation proteomics can identify differential PARP1/2 complexes and diverse, but actionable, drug compensatory signaling in OC.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is a highly lethal cancer that is often diagnosed at advanced stages, which leads to a low 5 year survival (1Vaughan S. Coward J.I. Bast R.C. Berchuck A. Berek J.S.

Dissecting the biological roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins has led to understanding their central role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and laid the ground for the discovery of synthetic lethality approaches with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors for tumors with pathogenic variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (2Farmer H.

Unlike normal cells, BRCA1/2-deficient cancer cells critically depend on PARP1 for backup DNA repair leading to selective killing of these cancer cells by targeting PARP1 and recent regulatory approval of several PARP1 inhibitors (PARPis) for BRCA1/2-linked OC (5Kaufman B.

Although PARPis produce major response rates of 40% to 60% for patients with BRCA1/2-linked advanced OCs, a significant number of tumors does not respond to these drugs (5Kaufman B.

While multiple studies have identified mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARPis, the processes that govern this primary resistance are incompletely understood. Although a recent study reported pre-existing BRCA-reversion mutations in a small subpopulation of patients as a consequence of prior platinum-based chemotherapy (13Lin K.K. Harrell M.I. Oza A.M. Oaknin A. Ray-Coquard I. Tinker A.V. et al.BRCA reversion mutations in circulating tumor DNA predict primary and acquired resistance to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in high-grade ovarian carcinoma.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 210-219Google Scholar), the majority of these cases are not explained by known genetic mechanisms. In addition, there are multiple reports that some patients with BRCA1/2-proficient OC unexpectedly also benefit from PARPi therapy (9Mirza M.R. Monk B.J. Herrstedt J. Oza A.M. Mahner S. Redondo A. et al.Niraparib maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375: 2154-2164Google Scholar, 14Ledermann J. Harter P. Gourley C. Friedlander M. Vergote I. Rustin G. et al.Olaparib maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer: a preplanned retrospective analysis of outcomes by BRCA status in a randomised phase 2 trial.Lancet Oncol. 2014; 15: 852-861Google Scholar). We hypothesized that OC cells that are insensitive to PARPi therapy may display proteomic features that are primed for mediating adaptive resistance signaling, the knowledge of which could enable the development of novel biomarkers and combination therapies, a recognized continuing medical need (15Chandrasekaran A. Elias K.M. Synthetic lethality in ovarian cancer.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2021; 20: 2117-2128Google Scholar). We furthermore posited that PARP1, the cognate target of PARPis, plays a central role in triggering such signaling effects, which could involve both PARP1 protein–protein interaction partners and proximal multiprotein complexes, as well as distal signaling events that are mediated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and phosphorylation. Recently, we have shown that chemical proteomics with PARPis as baits is able to not just capture direct drug targets, including PARP1 and PARP2, but also stable PARP-based protein complexes that involved different DDR proteins (16Knezevic C.E. Wright G. Rix L.L.R. Kim W. Kuenzi B.M. Luo Y. et al.Proteome-wide profiling of clinical PARP inhibitors reveals compound-specific secondary targets.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 1490-1503Google Scholar). We furthermore have demonstrated that the combination of chemical proteomics with phosphoproteomics and subsequent functional validation can lead to identification of mechanistic biomarker candidates and the rational design of synergistic drug combinations (17Ctortecka C. Palve V. Kuenzi B.M. Fang B. Sumi N.J. Izumi V. et al.Functional proteomics and deep network interrogation reveal a complex mechanism of action of midostaurin in lung cancer cells.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2018; 17: 2434-2447Google Scholar, 18Kuenzi B.M. Remsing Rix L.L. Stewart P.A. Fang B. Kinose F.

Colinge J. et al.A chemical and phosphoproteomic characterization of dasatinib action in lung cancer.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 291-299Google Scholar). In this study, we extended these concepts to specifically interrogate stable PARP1 protein complex partners in OC cells and determine how these proteins mount a global signaling response upon PARPi treatment. To this end, we used a comprehensive mass spectrometry (MS)–based functional proteomics approach that is comprised of chemical proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and ADP-ribosylation proteomics. Integrative analysis of these datasets indicated that OC cells that do not respond to PARPis displayed significant changes in PARP1 and PARP2 protein complex composition, as well as PTMs relevant to prosurvival AKT-mTOR signaling. Consequently, these cells exhibited prominent synergy of PARPis in combination with AKT inhibitors. In conclusion, the observation of actionable DDR and AKT/mTOR networks and subsequent validation demonstrates the potential of an unbiased integrated functional proteomics approach for discovering PARPi treatment-related signaling vulnerabilities in OC cells. To investigate the PARPi response in OC, we examined the efficacy of different PARPis in a pair of BRCA1-isogenic OC cells, that is, BRCA1-null UWB1.289 (UWB) cells and the corresponding UWB1.289 + BRCA1 (UWB+B) cells that express a restored WT BRCA1 function (Fig. 1A). UWB cells from a high grade serous ovarian carcinoma carry a germline BRCA1 pathogenic variant within exon 11 and have a deletion of the WT allele, and the UWB+B cell line had previously been generated from parental UWB cells by stable transfection (20DelloRusso C. Welcsh P.L. Wang W. Garcia R.L. King M.C. Swisher E.M. Functional characterization of a novel BRCA1-null ovarian cancer cell line in response to ionizing radiation.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 35-45Google Scholar). Using these cells, cell viability and IC50 values were determined upon treatment with three different FDA approved PARPis, namely olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib, by using crystal violet assays. Although it is possible that UWB+B cells were derived from a single clone and may feature some clone-specific properties, the BRCA1-null UWB cells were, as expected, more sensitive to all PARPis and reconstituted expression of BRCA1 resulted in loss of cytotoxicity to single agent PARPi treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). Therefore, PARPi-sensitive UWB cells and PARPi-insensitive UWB+B cells were chosen to explore mechanism-based biomarkers of PARPi response and primary resistance and to identify new therapeutic targets for rational drug combinations. We hypothesized that OC cells that do not respond to PARPi treatment display significant changes in PARP1 multiprotein complexes. To test this hypothesis, we employed a MS-based, chemical proteomics approach with PARPis as affinity baits. We have previously reported that this approach can identify not only different target profiles for each PARPi but also copurify PARP1-binding proteins (e.g., LIG3, XRCC5/Ku80, XRCC6/Ku70) (16Knezevic C.E. Wright G. Rix L.L.R. Kim W. Kuenzi B.M. Luo Y. et al.Proteome-wide profiling of clinical PARP inhibitors reveals compound-specific secondary targets.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 1490-1503Google Scholar). Each PARPi analog, the syntheses of which were described previously (16Knezevic C.E. Wright G. Rix L.L.R. Kim W. Kuenzi B.M. Luo Y. et al.Proteome-wide profiling of clinical PARP inhibitors reveals compound-specific secondary targets.Cell Chem. Biol. 2016; 23: 1490-1503Google Scholar) and which were successfully validated by PARP1 activity and binding assays, was individually immobilized on beads. To define differential PARP1 interacting proteins, we harnessed these olaparib and rucaparib analogs for chemical proteomics experiments with the BRCA1-isogenic UWB cell line pair and with OC patient tumor tissues that were collected prior to drug therapy (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Label-free quantitative MS analysis and subsequent data filtering were done by comparison with negative control samples derived from PARPi affinity purifications in the presence of unmodified PARPis, which scavenges targets and prevents them and their interaction partners from binding to the affinity beads. This process eliminated background proteins and highlighted several known direct drug targets, such as PARP1, PARP2, PARP4, and TNKS (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1A). In addition, analysis of the PARP1 subnetwork identified known PARP1-binding partners, such as PARP2 (which is also a direct drug target), Ku70, and NCL with both olaparib and rucaparib from UWB cells but not UWB+B cells (Fig. 2C). Subsequent immunoblotting of PARP1-engaged protein complex partners further confirmed higher levels of coenrichment of Ku70/Ku80 in olaparib and rucaparib drug pull downs from UWB compared with UWB+B cell lysates (Figs. 2D and S1B). Consistently, c-olaparib and c-rucaparib pull downs using frozen BRCA1-deficient OC tumor samples in comparison with BRCA1-proficient OC tumor samples, also showed increased enrichment of Ku70/Ku80 in BRCA1-deficient samples (Figs. 2E and S1C). Thus, these or similar PARP1:Ku70/Ku80 or PARP2 protein complex differences may determine sensitivity or primary resistance to PARPi in OC. Therefore, we examined the interaction of Ku70 with endogenous PARP1 and PARP2. Consistent with previous studies (21Yang G. Liu C. Chen S.H. Kassab M.A. Hoff J.D. Walter N.G. et al.Super-resolution imaging identifies PARP1 and the Ku complex acting as DNA double-strand break sensors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 3446-3457Google Scholar), Ku70 coimmunoprecipitated endogenous Ku80, PARP1, and PARP2 irrespective of BRCA1 status. However, we observed more pronounced Ku70:PARP2 interaction in UWB cells compared with UWB+B cells. Conversely, Ku70 interaction with PARP1 was more pronounced in UWB+B than in UWB cells (Fig. 2F and G). Taken together, chemical proteomics revealed differential PARP1 and PARP2 protein complex compositions with Ku70/Ku80 between PARPi-sensitive and PARPi-insensitive OC cells. To identify specific signaling mechanisms that are differentially affected by PARPi treatment between PARPi-sensitive and PARPi-insensitive cells, global phosphoproteomics was performed using tandem mass tag (TMT) MS-based relative quantification (Fig. 3A). UWB and UWB+B cells were treated with rucaparib (1 μM) or mock treated (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) for 24 h. Global enrichment of phosphopeptides was done by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). After data filtering and normalization, TMT-based quantification identified 9670 pSTY phosphopeptides in UWB cells and 9929 in UWB+B cells (Table S2), of which 92 and 103 phosphopeptides, respectively, were significantly regulated by rucaparib treatment (Fig. 3B). KEGG pathway analysis of UWB cells revealed significant enrichment of DDR-related signaling pathways, including nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), DNA replication, and homologous recombination. In contrast, focal adhesion, FoxO signaling, and ErbB signaling pathways were significantly enriched in UWB+B cells (Fig. 3C). Detailed analysis of the top 2 KEGG pathway components highlighted an increase of phosphorylation of RFC1, RAD50, MCM3, and DNAPK (PRKDC) by rucaparib in UWB cells (Fig. 3D and Fig. S2). In UWB+B cells, this analysis indicated a downregulation of activating phosphorylation of PAK1, MAPK3, and SHC1 in the EGFR and ErbB pathways by rucaparib, suggesting reduced signaling output in these cells by EGFR, which in turn displayed decreased phosphorylation of Y1197 and increased phosphorylation of the inhibitory serine S1081 (Figs. 3D and Fig. S2). Given that chemical proteomics revealed different PARP protein complexes with Ku70/Ku80, which are important for activation of DNAPK, and that phosphoproteomics indicated increased DNAPK phosphorylation upon rucaparib in UWB cells, understanding DNAPK activity in response to rucaparib in UWB cells could be critical in predicting potential mechanisms of sensitivity. Therefore, UWB and UWB+B cells were subjected to 1 μM rucaparib and were analyzed for rucaparib-induced DNAPK phosphorylation at S2056, which is a known autophosphorylation site and thus indicative of DNAPK activity. Indeed, Western blot analysis showed that rucaparib increased DNAPK phosphorylation at S2056 in UWB cells, but not in UWB+B cells, suggesting that PARPis induce activation of NHEJ in BRCA1-deficient OC cells, which is consistent with increased error prone DNA repair and a role in mediating cell sensitivity to PARPis (22Patel A.G. Sarkaria J.N. Kaufmann S.H. Nonhomologous end joining drives poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor lethality in homologous recombination-deficient cells.Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 2011; 108: 3406-3411Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E). In summary, phosphoproteomics illustrated rucaparib effects on major cell cycle and NHEJ repair pathways in UWB cells but not in UWB+B cells. To identify specific PARylation-mediated signaling events differentially modulated by PARPi treatment in drug-sensitive and drug-insensitive cells, we have synthesized 6-alkyne (6Yn)- and 2-alkyne (2Yn)-adenosine probes, which have been recently reported (23Kalesh K. Lukauskas S. Borg A.J. Snijders A.P. Ayyappan V. Leung A.K.L. et al.An integrated chemical proteomics approach for quantitative profiling of intracellular ADP-ribosylation.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 6555Google Scholar, 24Westcott N.P. Fernandez J.P. Molina H. Hang H.C. Chemical proteomics reveals ADP-ribosylation of small GTPases during oxidative stress.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13: 302-308Google Scholar) to allow for specific in situ labeling and identification of ADP-ribosylated proteins by MS (Fig. 4A). We treated UWB and UWB+B cells with 0.5 mM 2YnAd and 6YnAd for 1 h in the presence of 10 μM rucaparib or DMSO. After cell lysis and copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry, labeled proteins were affinity enriched using NeutrAvidin-agarose. In-gel fluorescence imaging confirmed significant enrichment of ADP-ribosylated proteins in both 2YnAd/6YnAd-treated cell lines (Fig. 4B). LC-MS/MS analysis identified 3431 and 3725 proteins in UWB and UWB+B cells (Table S3), respectively, of which 135 and 96 proteins were differentially ADP-ribosylated in response to rucaparib. These targets included MRE11, SOS1, GRB2, CDK6, CASP6, and CASP8 in UWB cells and AKT2, ABL2, ATR, PRKAG1, MAPK3, MAPK9, and MARCKS in UWB+B cells (Fig. 4C). KEGG and Reactome pathway analysis of all proteins that displayed decreased ADP-ribosylation upon rucaparib treatment in UWB cells identified a preferential enrichment for factors involved in the adaptive immune system and the cell cycle (Fig. 4D), several components of which were also observed by phosphoproteomics in PARPi-sensitive UWB cells, with highly significant hits such as CDC23, PSMD10, ORC1, POLD3, and MRE11. Notably, MRE11 is an important component of the MRN complex with NBN, phosphorylation of which was seen by phosphoproteomics to be significantly increased upon rucaparib treatment (Fig. 3B). In UWB cells, the decreased ADP-ribosylation of MRE11 and increased NBN and DNAPK activities suggest that PARPi treatment promotes MRN complex–mediated canonical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) repair. In contrast, pathway analysis of UWB+B cells suggested an enrichment of apoptosis, focal adhesion, ErbB signaling, and translation (Fig. 4D). Importantly, focal adhesion and ErbB signaling were also enriched in the phosphoproteomics data in PARPi-insensitive UWB+B cells. Detailed analysis of ErbB signaling pathway components highlighted decreased ADP-ribosylation of ABL2, MAPK3, MAPK9, and AKT2. Interestingly, the ADP-ribosylation of Ras/MAPK pathway associated adapter proteins SOS1 was significantly downregulated in response to rucaparib in UWB cells but not UWB+B cells. Considering that some studies showed AKT activation to play a role in PARPi resistance in cancer (25Gallyas Jr., F. Sumegi B. Szabo C. Role of Akt activation in PARP inhibitor resistance in cancer.Cancers (Basel). 2020; 12: 532Google Scholar), that DNAPK can mediate AKT activation and apoptosis inhibition in platinum resistance (26Stronach E.A. Chen M. Maginn E.N. Agarwal R. Mills G.B. Wasan H. et al.DNA-PK mediates AKT activation and apoptosis inhibition in clinically acquired platinum resistance.Neoplasia. 2011; 13: 1069-1080Google Scholar) and that AKT2 was identified only in the UWB+B cells to be ADP-ribosylated, we next evaluated AKT PARylation upon rucaparib treatment. Consistent with the proteomics data, AKT immunoprecipitation and Western blotting for PAR upon treatment of UWB and UWB+B cells with rucaparib (1 μM) for 24 h confirmed that AKT was PARylated and that AKT PARylation was significantly reduced by rucaparib treatment in UWB+B cells only (Fig. 4E). In summary, these data suggest that the global ADP-ribosylation patterns are profoundly different between PARPi-sensitive and PARPi-insensitive OC cells and that AKT PARylation is downregulated by PARPis specifically in PARPi-insensitive OC cells. To further understand the network-wide signaling effects in response to PARPis between sensitive UWB and insensitive UWB+B OC cells and considering that both phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation data converged on similar pathways, we next integrated both datasets by combining the identified phosphoproteins and ADP-ribosylated proteins and jointly querying KEGG and Wiki pathway databases (Fig. 5, A and B). This analysis consistently enriched more DDR-related and cell cycle–related signaling pathways in UWB cells while focal adhesion, FoxO, and VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathways were enriched in UWB+B cells. Detailed mapping of selected signaling changes within these pathways illustrated several ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation events that point at differentially modulated DDR and AKT/mTORC1/AMPK signaling in these cell lines (Fig. 5C). Most notably, AKT appeared as a central node within the effector network in PARPi-insensitive UWB+B cells. We next asked, if targeting the AKT pathway enhances the efficacy of PARPis in drug-insensitive OC cells. Combination of rucaparib with the selective AKT inhibitor AZD5363 and subsequent assessment by the Bliss model of independence indicated stronger synergy across a broad concentration range in UWB+B cells compared with UWB cells (Fig. 6, A–C). This result was particularly pronounced for clinically relevant concentration ranges of rucaparib (∼1–2 μM) as UWB cells showed much greater sensitivity to rucaparib at these concentrations than UWB+B cells. Consistently, immunoblot interrogation of the AKT and DNAPK pathways in UWB and UWB+B cells upon treatment with rucaparib (1 μM) and/or AZD5363 (1 μM) for 24 h indicated that, as expected, AZD5363 alone effectively inhibited phosphorylation of PRAS40 (T246) and S6 (S235/236) downstream of AKT, whereas it increased phosphorylation of AKT at S473, an mTORC2 target site, in both cell lines. Notably, AKT and S6 phosphorylation were markedly decreased by rucaparib in UWB cells, whereas no significant change was apparent in rucaparib-treated UWB+B cells. However, addition of AZD5363 strongly inhibited PRAS40 and S6 phosphorylation in both cell lines. Interestingly, inhibition of AKT reduced rucaparib-induced DNAPK phosphorylation at S2056 in UWB cells (not shown), whereas in rucaparib-treated UWB+B cells, addition of AZD5363 increased DNAPK activity, which may also be indicative of the synergy between AKT inhibitors and rucaparib in these cells. Taken together, our data suggest AKT-mTORC1 signaling as a major mechanism of PARPi primary resistance in OC cells and that AKT pathway inhibition and c-NHEJ pathway activation by AZD5363 elicits strong synergistic activity with rucaparib, particularly in UWB+B cells. Genomic characterization has revolutionized cancer therapy. Mutations such as BRAFV600E, EGFRL858R, or KRASG12C serve both as powerful biomarkers in melanoma and lung cancer as well as highly actionable drug targets for small molecule targeted therapeutics. In OC, loss-of-function variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been firmly established and approved by the FDA as biomarkers that indicate defects in HRR, which causes synthetic lethality with PARPi therapy. However, only about half the patients with BRCA-deficient OC experience objective tumor responses upon PARPi therapy and most of such primary PARPi resistance is not explained by other genetic mutations like BRCA reversions (13Lin K.K. Harrell M.I. Oza A.M. Oaknin A. Ray-Coquard I. Tinker A.V. et al.BRCA reversion mutations in circulating tumor DNA predict primary and acquired resistance to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in high-grade ovarian carcinoma.Cancer Discov. 2019; 9: 210-219Google Scholar). At the same time, clinical studies have established that not only BRCA-deficient but also a proportion of BRCA-proficient OC can respond to PARPis. Although HRR signatures or the levels and patterns of ADP-ribosylation may correlate with PARPi responses and clinical outcomes in these OCs (27Conrad L.B. Lin K.Y. Nandu T. Gibson B.A. Lea J.S. Kraus W.L. ADP-ribosylation levels and patterns correlate with gene expression and clinical outcomes in ovarian cancers.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2020; 19: 282-291Google Scholar), the roles and underlying mechanisms of these potential biomarkers are still incompletely understood. The DDR and DNA repair are highly dynamic and interconnected processes that involve a multitude of proteins and signaling pathways. We therefore applied an integrated MS-based functional proteomics approach including chemical proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and ADP-ribosylation proteomics to characterize PARP1 protein complexes across BRCA1-deficient and BRCA1-proficient OC cell lines and patient tumor specimens and to determine the proteome-wide effects of PARPis on OC cell signaling pathways. The most common mechanisms of PARPi sensitivity of a BRCA1/2-deficient tumor are through synthetic lethality and PARP trapping (2Farmer H. McCabe N. Lord C.J. Tutt A.N. Johnson D.A.

Metabolic disorders can be caused by various factors that promote abnormal lipid accumulation in storage organelles called lipid droplets (LDs), as in hepatic steatosis, a metabolic syndrome manifestation that can progress to a hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common primary liver malignancy worldwide. Modern life involves conditions that disrupt the biological clock, causing metabolic disorders and higher cancer risk. A circadian clock is present in the liver and in immortalized cell lines and temporally regulates physiological processes by driving transcriptional and metabolic rhythms. Here we investigated metabolic rhythms in HepG2 cells, a human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line, and the link between these rhythms and the circadian clock in control (Bmal1-wildtype) and Bmal1-disrupted (B-D) cells having their molecular clock impaired. Rhythms in the expression of lipid-synthesizing enzymes ChoKα, Pcyt2, and Lipin1, in the metabolism of particular glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine, and in the phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio and TG and LD content were observed in Bmal1-wildtype cells. By contrast, in the B-D model, the whole hepatic metabolism was severely altered with a significant reduction in the TG and LD content as well as in ChoKα and other related lipid enzymes. Together, our results suggest a very strong crosstalk between the molecular clock and lipid metabolism, which exhibits an exacerbated pathological condition in B-D cells."

During B cell development, antigen-mediated cross-linking of the B cell receptor (BCR) activates the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) (1Burger J.A. Wiestner A. Targeting B cell receptor signalling in cancer: preclinical and clinical advances.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18: 148-167Google Scholar). BTK then promotes the activation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to elicit an increase of intracellular Ca2+ (2Takata M. Kurosaki T.

Inhibitors that target BTK (BTKi) have emerged as breakthrough therapies for treating a variety of B-cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (12Burger J.A. Tedeschi A. Barr P.M. Robak T. Owen C. Ghia P. et al.Ibrutinib as initial therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 373: 2425-2437Google Scholar, 13Dreyling M.

However, durable response to BTKi is hampered by acquired resistance after prolonged treatment (15Furman R.R. Cheng S. Lu P. Setty M. Perez A.R.

First- and second-generation BTKi, such as ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib, inhibit the kinase activity of BTK by binding to its ATP-binding pocket and then covalently modifying a cysteine residue at position 481 (C481) of BTK (17Pan Z. Scheerens H. Li S.-J. Schultz B.E. Sprengeler P.A. Burrill L.C. et al.Discovery of selective irreversible inhibitors for Bruton’s tyrosine kinase.ChemMedChem. 2007; 2: 58-61Google Scholar, 18Guo Y.

Chem. 2019; 62: 7923-7940Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the most common mechanism of BTKi resistance occurs through mutations changing this reactive cysteine into serine (C481S) and less frequently into phenylalanine, tyrosine, or arginine (C481F, C481Y, and C481R) (19Maddocks K.J. Ruppert A.S. Lozanski G. Heerema N.A. Zhao W.

In addition, several non-C481 mutations have been observed in patients resistant to irreversible BTKi (19Maddocks K.J. Ruppert A.S. Lozanski G. Heerema N.A. Zhao W.

Mi X. Thompson M.C. Montoya S. Notti R.Q. Afaghani J. et al.Mechanisms of resistance to noncovalent Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors.N. Engl. J. Med. 2022; 386: 735-743Google Scholar). Whereas previous studies have clarified their mechanism of resistance to BTKi, whether these BTK mutations affect the biochemical activity and/or function of BTK in malignant B cells are not well understood. In an attempt to explore the biochemical impact of clinically observed BTK mutations, we first docked ATP into the active site of BTK kinase domain. In the resulting structural model, the adenine ring of ATP formed hydrogen bonds with the side chain of T474 and the backbone of M477 in BTK. In addition, the phosphate group of ATP was locked in the active site of BTK by forming two hydrogen bonds with the side chain of K430. Residues C481 and L528 were located below the binding pocket and showed no direct interaction with ATP (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we evaluated whether clinically observed BTK C481 and non-C481 mutations might affect ATP binding. Whereas C481S was not expected to affect the mode of ATP binding, substitutions of C481 by bulky side chains of phenylalanine (C481F), tyrosine (C481Y), or arginine (C481R) were all predicted to generate steric clashes to the sugar ring or the phosphate group of ATP (Fig. 1B). Similarly, leucine at position 528 mutated to tryptophan (L528W) caused a steric clash to the adenine ring of ATP (Fig. 1B). To verify these predictions, we purified recombinant BTK kinase domains and performed the thermal shift assay. We observed that ATP stabilized the kinase domains of BTK WT, C481S, and C481R but did not stabilize the kinase domains of BTK C481F, C481Y, and L528W (Fig. 1, C and D). Compared to phenylalanine and tyrosine, arginine may be more flexible at the active site due to the lack of an aromatic ring in its side chain. Thus, ATP may gain access to the active site and stabilize the kinase domain of BTK C481R. These observations prompted us to examine the kinase activity of BTK mutants using an in vitro kinase assay. By incubating the BTK kinase domain with either a peptide substrate derived from PLCγ2 or a protein substrate (the SH3 domain of BTK containing an auto-phosphorylation site), we observed a near complete lack of kinase activity of BTK C481F, C481Y, and L528W in vitro (Fig. 1E). Notably, although C481R did not show a defect in ATP binding in the thermal shift assay, its kinase activity was significantly reduced compared with that of the WT BTK (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results revealed that four clinically observed BTK mutations, C481F, C481Y, C481R, and L528W, impaired BTK kinase activity in vitro. To examine whether C481F/Y/R and L528W impaired BTK kinase activity in malignant B cells, we selected TMD8 and OCI-LY10, two diffused large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines of the activated B-cell subtype (9Davis R.E. Ngo V.N. Lenz G. Tolar P. Young R.M. Romesser P.B. et al.Chronic active B-cell-receptor signalling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Nature. 2010; 463: 88-92Google Scholar), as our experimental models because of their sensitivity to ibrutinib (Fig. S1A). We used a lentiviral vector to stably express BTK WT, C481S/F/Y/R, or L528W in TMD8 and OCI-LY10 cells at levels near their endogenous BTK (Fig. S1B) and then examined their sensitivity to ibrutinib. Whereas expression of WT BTK did not alter the sensitivity of TMD8 or OCI-LY10 to ibrutinib, expression of BTK C481S/F/Y/R and L528W conferred resistance to ibrutinib in both cell lines (Fig. S1C). These isogenic cell lines, in which endogenous BTK was inactivated by ibrutinib, allowed us to examine the biochemical and functional sequelae of BTK mutations. Because BTK is a tyrosine kinase, we used deep phospho-tyrosine (pY) proteomics to profile changes of global pY patterns in DLBCL cells following BTK inactivation by ibrutinib. After proteolytic digestion, pY-modified peptides were enriched by an Src homology 2-domain–derived pTyr superbinder (23Bian Y. Li L. Dong M. Liu X. Kaneko T. Cheng K. et al.Ultra-deep tyrosine phosphoproteomics enabled by a phosphotyrosine superbinder.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 959-966Google Scholar) followed by identification by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A). We identified 176 distinct pY-modified peptides from TMD8 and OCI-LY10 cells (Table S2). Two of these peptides, BTK pY223 and pY361, showed greater than 75% reduction in both cell lines following ibrutinib treatment (Fig. S2A). Moreover, we used anti-IgM stimulation to enhance BCR signaling, resulting in the identification of 218 distinct pY-modified peptides (Table S2). Five of these pY-modified peptides, BTK pY223, BTK pY361, CCDC50 pY146, ESYT1 pY822, and OCIAD1 pY199, showed greater than 75% reduction in both cell lines following ibrutinib treatment (Fig. S2A). We next used deep pY proteomics to compare the global pY patterns of TMD8 cells expressing BTK C481S/F/Y/R (treated with ibrutinib to inactivate their endogenous BTK) with those of parental TMD8 cells. Among the pY-modified peptides that showed greater than 75% reduction relative to parental cells, four were common in C481F/Y/R, including BTK pY223, BTK pY361, DNAJA1 pY381, and DOK1 pY409 (Fig. 2B). BTK pY223 is a well-known auto-phosphorylation site of BTK (24Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E.H. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. et al.Regulation of Btk function by a major autophosphorylation site within the SH3 domain.Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, BTK Y223 phosphorylation could be detected in parental TMD8 and BTK C481S-expressing cells but was missing in TMD8 cells expressing BTK C481F/Y/R or L528W (Figs. 2C and S2B). Cross-linking of BCR by anti-IgM increased BTK Y223 phosphorylation in parental and BTK C481S-expressing TMD8 cells but not in BTK C481F/Y/R- or L528W-expressing TMD8 cells (Figs. 2C and S2B). Similar observations were made in OCI-LY10 cells (Fig. S2, B and C). To further validate findings from deep pY proteomics, we employed CRISPR genome editing in TMD8 to obtain a BTK L528W knock-in clone, which was 264-fold less sensitive to ibrutinib than the parental TMD8 (Fig. S3, A and B). In contrast, the proliferation rate of BTK L528W knock-in clone was indistinguishable from that of parental TMD8 cells (Fig. S3C). Consistent with deep pY proteomics results, BTK Y223 phosphorylation was missing in BTK L528W knock-in TMD8 cells (Fig. 2D). Activated BTK is known to phosphorylate PLCγ2 (Y753, Y759, and Y1217) (25Rodriguez R. Matsuda M. Perisic O. Bravo J. Paul A. Jones N.P. et al.Tyrosine residues in phospholipase Cγ2 essential for the enzyme function in B-cell signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47982-47992Google Scholar). However, deep pY proteomics showed that PLCγ2 phosphorylation was not affected by the loss of BTK kinase activity (Table S2). Moreover, Western blotting confirmed the lack of correlation between PLCγ2 phosphorylation (pY759 and pY1217) and BTK kinase activity in both TMD8 and OCI-LY10 cells (Figs. 2C and S2, B and C). Similar observations were made in L528W knock-in TMD8 cells (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the identified pY sites of PLCγ2 are likely phosphorylated by a different kinase in DLBCL cells. We next examined whether BTK kinase activity was required for oncogenic BCR signaling by measuring Ca2+ flux following BCR cross-linking. By testing a panel of B-cell lymphoma cell lines, we found that half of them displayed Ca2+ flux following anti-IgM stimulation (Fig. S4, A and B). Among the responding cell lines, TMD8 cells displayed Ca2+ flux peaked around 1 min and subsided by 4 min post anti-IgM stimulation. Pretreatment with ibrutinib reduced the magnitude of the Ca2+ flux in parental TMD8 cells by 3.2-fold (Fig. 3, A and B). Comparable anti-IgM–induced Ca2+ flux was observed in BTK L528W knock-in cells relative to parental cells, and the Ca2+ flux in BTK L528W knock-in cells could no longer be suppressed by ibrutinib (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that TMD8 cells without BTK kinase activity maintain oncogenic BCR signaling. Extending from findings in TMD8, we examined BCR signaling in the Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line Ramos, in which anti-IgM induced robust Ca2+ flux (Fig. S4, A and B). Ramos does not rely on BCR signaling for survival; we thus isolated a BTK KO clone of Ramos (Fig. S4C). The resulting BTK KO cells showed reduced Ca2+ flux following anti-IgM stimulation (Fig. S4D). We were initially surprised that knocking out BTK did not completely abrogate anti-IgM–induced Ca2+ flux; however, similar phenomena were observed in multiple previous studies (26Tomlinson M.G. Kurosaki T. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H. Johnston J.A. Bolen J.B. Reconstitution of Btk signaling by the atypical Tec family tyrosine kinases Bmx and Txk.J. Biol.

DeAnda F. et al.Kinase-deficient BTK mutants confer ibrutinib resistance through activation of the kinase HCK.Sci. Signal. 2022; 15eabg5216Google Scholar), suggesting that BTK-independent mechanisms could contribute to residual Ca2+ flux in BTK KO cells. We then expressed various BTK mutants and found all of them rescued the defective Ca2+ flux in BTK KO Ramos cells to the same degree as WT BTK (Fig. 3, C and D). These results altogether suggest that the kinase activity of BTK is dispensable for the induction of Ca2 + flux to transmit oncogenic BCR signaling. BCR signaling activates multiple transcription factors to sustain the growth and survival of malignant B cells (4Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Differential activation of transcription factors induced by Ca2+ response amplitude and duration.Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Google Scholar, 5Liu Q.-H. Liu X. Wen Z. Hondowicz B. King L. Monroe J. et al.Distinct calcium channels regulate responses of primary B lymphocytes to B cell receptor engagement and mechanical stimuli.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 68Google Scholar). We therefore used RNA-seq to examine whether the loss of BTK kinase activity might affect gene expression downstream of BCR signaling (Table S3). By comparing parental TMD8 cells treated with vehicle or ibrutinib, we defined a list of 179 significantly upregulated genes and 192 significantly downregulated genes in ibrutinib-treated cells (Figs. 3E and S5A). Gene ontology analyses revealed that ibrutinib treatment downregulated genes involved in cytokine-mediated signaling pathways and regulation of cell adhesion and chemotaxis, consistent with previous studies (Fig. 3F) (28de Rooij M.F.M. Kuil A. Geest C.R. Eldering E. Chang B.Y. Buggy J.J. et al.The clinically active BTK inhibitor PCI-32765 targets B-cell receptor– and chemokine-controlled adhesion and migration in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Blood. 2012; 119: 2590-2594Google Scholar, 29Ponader S.

Genes upregulated by ibrutinib did not enrich gene sets with statistical significance (Fig. S5F). By displaying these differentially expressed genes as a heat map, we found that they were expressed at comparable levels in TMD8 cells expressing kinase-active BTK C481S or kinase-inactive BTK C481F/Y/R (Figs. 3E and S5, B–E). These results demonstrate that loss of BTK kinase activity does not affect gene expression downstream of BCR signaling. We used a competitive cell growth assay to examine whether DLBCL cells deficient in BTK kinase activity remained dependent on BCR signaling for growth and survival (Fig. 4A). To ensure comparable CRISPR efficiencies, we isolated Cas9-transduced clones of parental TMD8 and BTK L528W knock-in cells and validated their dependencies on the pan-essential gene POLD3 (Fig. S6A). We then used an sgRNA-targeting BTK and found that sgRNA-transduced cells from both parental and BTK L528W knock-in cells were depleted at comparable rates (Fig. 4B). The reduction of cell fitness due to loss of BTK could be fully rescued by complementary DNAs encoding either kinase-active BTK (WT and C481S) or kinase-inactive BTK (L528W and C481F/Y/R) (Fig. S6B). We next transduced cells with sgRNAs that target several key genes of the BCR signaling pathway, including CD79A/CD79B (encoding components of the BCR complex), SYK, BLNK (encoding B cell linker protein), PLCG2, PRKCB (encoding protein kinase C β), CARD11/BCL10/MALT1 (encoding components of the CBM signalosome complex), and NFKB1 (encoding a nuclear factor kappa B subunit). We observed that both TMD8 parental cells and BTK L528W knock-in cells were equally dependent on these genes for survival (Fig. 4B). Altogether, these results demonstrate that DLBCL harboring BTK kinase-inactivating mutations does not bypass BCR signaling for growth and survival. Because DLBCL cells with kinase-inactive BTK remained addicted to BTK, we hypothesized that targeted BTK degradation by the proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) might be an effective strategy to overcome BTKi resistance (30Sun Y. Zhao X. Ding N. Gao H. Wu Y. Yang Y. et al.PROTAC-induced BTK degradation as a novel therapy for mutated BTK C481S induced ibrutinib-resistant B-cell malignancies.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 779-781Google Scholar). Thus, we employed a BTK PROTAC (BGB-15741) to hijack the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4CRBN to degrade BTK (Fig. 4C). BGB-15741 treatment induced the degradation of both WT BTK and BTK L528W in TMD8 cells, which could be blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the CRBN binder lenalidomide (Fig. S7, A and B). TMD8 and OCI-LY10 cells harboring kinase-inactive BTK mutations were sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of BGB-15741 (Fig. 4D). Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we examined the proteome-wide selectivity of BGB-15741. In TMD8 cells treated with BGB-15741 for 6 h, BTK and JUN were the only two proteins significantly depleted (Fig. S7C and Table S4). By querying previous genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening in TMD8 (31Phelan J.D. Young R.M. Webster D.E. Roulland S. Wright G.W. Kasbekar M. et al.A multiprotein supercomplex controlling oncogenic signalling in lymphoma.Nature. 2018; 560: 387-391Google Scholar), we found that JUN was not essential for the survival of TMD8 (Fig. S7D). Thus, we conclude that the antiproliferative activity of BGB-15741 is a result of BTK degradation. Taken together, the BTK PROTAC BGB-15741 promotes the degradation of kinase-inactive BTK mutants to overcome resistance to irreversible BTKi. To unbiasedly explore whether BTK kinase-inactivating mutations might result in alterations of DLBCL genetic dependencies, we performed a parallel genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening in parental TMD8 and L528W knock-in cells. After lentiviral transduction of the sgRNA library, we propagated cells for 3 weeks and then performed next-generation sequencing to quantify the abundance of each sgRNA in surviving cells (Fig. 5A). MAGeCK (Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout) algorithm ranked 12 significantly depleted genes in L528W knock-in cells relative to parental cells (Fig. 5B and Table S5). Among these 12 candidates, STRING analysis revealed that Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), unc-93 homolog B1 (UNC93B1), and canopy homolog 3 (CNPY3) formed a protein–protein interaction network (Fig. 5B). TLR9 is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR), which localizes to the endosomes and senses microbial DNA to trigger proinflammatory signaling (32Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. et al.TLR9 signals after translocating from the ER to CpG DNA in the lysosome.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 190-198Google Scholar). CNPY3 and UNC93B1 are required for proper TLR9 folding and localization to endosomes, respectively (33Kim Y.-M. Brinkmann M.M. Paquet M.-E. Ploegh H.L. UNC93B1 delivers nucleotide-sensing toll-like receptors to endolysosomes.Nature. 2008; 452: 234-238Google Scholar, 34Brinkmann M.M. Spooner E. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Ploegh H.L. Kim Y.-M. The interaction between the ER membrane protein UNC93B and TLR3, 7, and 9 is crucial for TLR signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 265-275Google Scholar, 35Takahashi K. Shibata T. Akashi-Takamura S. Kiyokawa T. Wakabayashi Y. Tanimura N. et al.A protein associated with toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (PRAT4A) is required for TLR-dependent immune responses.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2963-2976Google Scholar). In addition, sgRNAs targeting the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase HCK were also depleted in L528W knock-in cells relative to parental cells (Fig. 5B). We next used the competitive cell growth assay (Fig. 4A) to validate findings from the CRISPR-Cas9 screening. When transduced with sgRNAs targeting TLR9, BTK L528W knock-in cells were depleted with significantly faster kinetics relative to parental cells (Fig. S8A). To exclude clonal effects in the competitive cell growth assay, we used the suite of isogenic TMD8-Cas9 cells expressing BTK C481S/F/Y/R and L528W and inactivated their endogenous BTK with ibrutinib. When transduced with the sgRNA-targeting POLD3, TMD8-Cas9 cells expressing different forms of BTK were depleted with similar kinetics, suggesting their comparable CRISPR efficiencies (Fig. 5C). In contrast, when transduced with sgRNAs targeting TLR9, UNC93B1, CNYP3, or HCK, BTK kinase-inactive cells (C481F/Y/R and L528W) were depleted with significantly faster kinetics than BTK kinase-active cells (C481S). (Figs. 5C and S8B). Similar observations were made in OCI-LY10-Cas9 cells (Figs. 5C and S8B). Taken together, we conclude that DLBCL cells with kinase-inactive BTK are more dependent on TLR9 signaling for their growth and/or survival. Our study unveiled a collection of clinically observed BTK mutations that not only cause resistance to irreversible BTKi but also inactivate the kinase activity of BTK. These mutations affect two residues in BTK, C481, and L528, substituting them with residues containing bulky side chains, resulting in steric hindrance to ATP binding. By studying the biochemical and functional properties of these BTK mutants in DLBCL cell lines, we made the unexpected finding that kinase-inactive BTK mutants were as efficient at transducing BCR signaling as their WT counterpart. Similar observations of kinase-inactive BTK mutants have been made in other experimental systems. Tomlinson et al. (36Tomlinson M.G. Woods D.B. McMahon M. Wahl M.I. Witte O.N. Kurosaki T. et al.A conditional form of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is sufficient to activate multiple downstream signaling pathways via PLC Gamma 2 in B cells.BMC Immunol. 2001; 2: 4Google Scholar) observed that a kinase-inactive BTK (K430E) could restore BCR-induced calcium flux and ERK-MAPK activation in BTK-deficient DT40 cells. In addition, BTK C481F and C481Y mutants have been reported to lack auto-phosphorylation activity in HEK 293T and DT40 cells (20Hamasy A. Wang Q. Blomberg K.E.M. Mohammad D.K. Yu L. Vihinen M. et al.Substitution scanning identifies a novel, catalytically active ibrutinib-resistant BTK cysteine 481 to threonine (C481T) variant.Leukemia. 2017; 31: 177-185Google Scholar, 27Dhami K. Chakraborty A. Gururaja Tarikere L. Cheung Leo W.K. Sun C. DeAnda F. et al.Kinase-deficient BTK mutants confer ibrutinib resistance through activation of the kinase HCK.Sci. Signal. 2022; 15eabg5216Google Scholar). Together with our results, BTK’s noncatalytic activity instead of kinase activity is required for oncogenic BCR signaling to support the growth and survival of malignant B cells. Although protein kinases are known primarily as enzymes catalyzing phosphorylation, accumulating evidence has revealed their noncatalytic functions, such as allosteric regulation of other enzymes, scaffolding the assembly of signaling complexes, and regulation of transcription (37Kung J.E. Jura N. Structural basis for the non-catalytic functions of protein kinases.Structure. 2016; 24: 7-24Google Scholar). Our parallel CRISPR-Cas9 screening in DLBCL cells with kinase-active versus kinase-inactive BTK revealed an increased genetic dependency of BTK kinase-inactive cells on TLR9, UNC93B1, CNPY3, and HCK. Thus, inactivation of BTK kinase activity resulted in a loss of cellular fitness only when these genes were inactivated. HCK is a member of the SRC family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (SFKs) and is expressed in myeloid cells and B lymphocytes (38Ziegler S.F. Marth J.D. Lewis D.B. Perlmutter R.M. Novel protein-tyrosine kinase gene (hck) preferentially expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2276-2285Google Scholar). High levels of HCK have been reported in various types of leukemia, such as multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (39Podar K. Mostoslavsky G. Sattler M. Tai Y.-T. Hayashi T.

https://openalex.org/W4298394988,"Abstract Cisplatin, 5FU and docetaxel (TPF) are the most common chemotherapy regimen used for advanced OSCC. However, many cancer patients experience relapse, continued tumor growth, and spread due to drug resistance, which leads to treatment failure and metastatic disease. Here, using a CRISPR/Cas9 based kinome knockout screening, Misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) is identified as an important mediator of 5FU resistance in OSCC. Analysis of clinical samples demonstrated significantly higher MINK1 expression in the tumor tissues of chemotherapy non-responders as compared to chemotherapy responders. The nude mice and zebrafish xenograft experiments indicate that knocking out MINK1 restores 5FU mediated cell death in chemoresistant OSCC. An antibody based phosphorylation array screen revealed MINK1 as a negative regulator of p53. Mechanistically, MINK1 modulates AKT phosphorylation at Ser473, which enables p-MDM2 (Ser 166) mediated degradation of p53. We also identified lestaurtinib as a potent inhibitor of MINK1 kinase activity. The patient derived TPF resistant cell based xenograft data suggest that lestaurtinib restores 5FU sensitivity and facilitates a significant reduction of tumor burden. Overall, our study suggests that MINK1 is a major driver of 5FU resistance in OSCC. The novel combination of MINK1 inhibitor lestaurtinib and 5FU needs further clinical investigation in advanced OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W4300688721,"Acoustic signals produced by animals must transmit through the environment to reach potential receivers and change their behaviour. Both the environment (vegetation, air properties, other animals) and the form of the signal affect the propagation process. Here we investigated how the transmission of different song types of a duetting songbird species inhabiting an extreme environment within African montane forest, varies between males and females as well as different types of micro-habitats. We hypothesised that male and female songs would have different transmission properties, reflecting known differences in signal form and function. We analysed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), excess attenuation (EA) and tail-to-signal ratio (TSR) of songs of male and female Yellow-breasted Boubous ( Laniarius atroflavus ) that were played and re-recorded in a range of sites representing the species-typical habitats. We found significant effects of distance, site (habitat) and sex reflected in all three measures of sound degradation. The clearest, primarily distance-dependent pattern was found for SNR of songs propagated in level forest site. EA was substantially higher in shrubs than in forest habitats, while TSR reflecting longer echoes appeared at longer distances in forest sites. Thus, Yellow-breasted Boubou songs are better propagated in forests than in disturbed sites covered with shrubs. We found that all male song types used for broadcast singing propagated farther than female songs, with significantly higher SNR at all distances. The different male song types which are known to have different functions, also demonstrated a differentiated pattern of propagation reflecting their functionality. All signals that were tested propagated the furthest in the ideal condition described as forest with a level terrain. Signals degraded much faster during transmission through shrubs regrowing after forest burning. On this site, the differences in the propagation of male and female songs, as well as the differences between male song types, were relatively least pronounced. Transmission in typical mountain forest among streams and with substantial terrain variation revealed that degradation pattern in such habitat could be perturbed in a non-linear way. Streams acting as a source of high noise level also negatively affected transmission and may strongly limit the perception of birds staying close to them. However, stream noise did not affect sex differences in song propagation as was found for the site located in shrubs. Male songs showed more efficient transmission through all habitats (least in the shrubs) than female song. These differences were the result of male songs having a whistle structure that is better adapted for long-range propagation than the atonal, wideband frequency female vocalisations. Results support the idea that signals of males of the Yellow-breasted Boubous evolved under the pressure of long-range communication both with rivals and females, while females of the species are much more focused on within-pair communication or signalling together with their partner. The consequence of deforestation resulting in pushing back territories to the forest remnants along streams may be a shortening of the song’s active range, in particular, in females."
https://openalex.org/W4300689283,"DEK has a short isoform (DEK isoform-2; DEK2) that lacks amino acid residues between 49-82. The full-length DEK (DEK isoform-1; DEK1) is ubiquitously expressed and plays a role in different cellular processes but whether DEK2 is involved in these processes remains elusive. We stably overexpressed DEK2 in human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-27A, in which endogenous DEKs were intact or suppressed via short hairpin RNA (sh-RNA). We have found that contrary to ectopic DEK1, DEK2 locates in the nucleus and nucleolus, causes persistent γH2AX signal upon doxorubicin treatment, and couldn't functionally compensate for the loss of DEK1. In addition, DEK2 overexpressing cells were more sensitive to doxorubicin than DEK1-cells. Expressions of DEK1 and DEK2 in cell lines and primary tumors exhibit tissue specificity. DEK1 is upregulated in cancers of the colon, liver, and lung compared to normal tissues while both DEK1 and DEK2 are downregulated in subsets of kidney, prostate, and thyroid carcinomas. Interestingly, only DEK2 was downregulated in a subset of breast tumors suggesting that DEK2 can be modulated differently than DEK1 in specific cancers. In summary, our findings show distinct expression patterns and subcellular location and suggest non-overlapping functions between the two DEK isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W4300689289,"The extracellular matrix in the tumour microenvironment can regulate cancer cell growth and progression. A pan-cancer analysis of TCGA data from 30 cancer types, identified the top 5% of matrisome genes with amplifications or deletions in their copy number, that affect their expression and cancer survival. A similar analysis of matrisome genes in individual cancers identified CTHRC1 to be significantly altered. CTHRC1, a regulator of collagen synthesis, was identified as the most prominently upregulated matrisome gene of interest across cancers. Differential gene expression analysis identified 19 genes whose expression is increased with CTHRC1. STRING analysis of these genes classified them as 'extracellular', involved most prominently in ECM organization and cell adhesion. KEGG analysis showed their involvement in ECM-receptor and growth factor signalling. Cytohubba analysis of these genes revealed 13 hub genes, of which MMP13, POSTN, SFRP4, ADAMTS16 and FNDC1 were significantly altered in their expression with CTHRC1 and seen to affect survival across cancers. This could in part be mediated by their overlapping roles in regulating ECM (collagen or fibronectin) expression and organisation. In breast cancer tumour samples CTHRC1 protein levels are significantly upregulated with POSTN and MMP13, further supporting the need to evaluate their crosstalk in cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4300689675,"Prolonged (duration >7 to 13 days) diarrhea (ProD) in under-five children is a universal health problem including Bangladesh. Data on epidemiology and associated or risk factors of ProD are limited, particularly in Bangladesh where a high burden of ProD is reported. This study intended to assess the case load of ProD and its associated or risk factors compared to acute diarrhea (AD, duration ≤7 days).We analyzed the data collected between 1996-2014 from a hospital-based Diarrheal-Disease-Surveillance-System (DDSS) in the 'Dhaka Hospital' of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases, Bangladesh (icddr,b). The DDSS enrolled a 2% systematic sample, regardless of age, sex, and diarrhea severity. The data included information on socio-demographic factors, environmental history, clinical characteristics, nutritional status, and diarrhea-pathogens. After cleaning of data, relevant information of 21,566 under-five children were available who reported with ≤13 days diarrhea (including AD and ProD), and their data were analyzed. Variables found significantly associated with ProD compared to AD in bi-variate analysis were used in logistic regression model after checking the multicollinearity between independent variables.The mean±SD age of the children was 14.9±11.7 months and 40.4% were female; 7.6% had ProD and 92.4% had AD. Age <12 months, mucoid- or bloody-stool, warmer months (April-September), drug used at home before seeking care from hospital, and history of diarrhea within last one month were found associated with ProD (p<0.05); however, rotavirus infection was less common in children with ProD (p<0.05). ProD children more often needed inpatient admission than AD children (14.4 vs. 6.3, p<0.001). Case fatality rate of ProD vs. AD was 0.3% (n = 5) vs. 0.1% (n- = 22) respectively (p = 0.051).A considerable proportion (7.6%) of under-five children reporting to icddr,b hospital suffered from ProD. Understanding the above-mentioned associated or risk factors is likely to help policy makers formulating appropriate strategies for alleviating the burden and effectively managing ProD in under-five children."
https://openalex.org/W4300690056,"Abstract The prognostic value of immune cells in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) remains unclear in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, 59 of 145 patients had TLSs in training set, 48 of 120 patients had TLSs in testing set. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to label CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD208+ dendritic cells, and CD21+ follicular dendritic cells in TLSs. High CD20+, CD208+, and CD8+ cell densities were favorable prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). High CD3+, CD20+, CD208+, and CD8+ cell densities were significantly associated with reduced early recurrence. TLSs were divided into three grades (A, B, and C) based on immune cell density. Patients with grade C or B had significantly improved OS. Patients with grade C had the lowest recurrence rate, followed by those with grade B, while patients with grade A had the highest recurrence rate. The stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores derived from the ESTIMATE package were significantly higher and tumor purity was significantly lower in patients with TLSs. Patients with TLSs had significantly higher relative numbers of memory B cells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells and lower relative numbers of Treg cells, macrophages, and M2 macrophages according to the CIBERSORT assessment. Bioinformatics analysis and experiments confirmed that KLRK1 and GZMA expression are associated TLSs formation and can predict TLSs existence. Grade B and grade C were favorable prognostic factors for OS and recurrence and could represent immune‐active tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4300690533,"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) has been and remains an important malaria control intervention in southern Mozambique, South Africa and Eswatini. A better understanding of the effectiveness of IRS campaigns is critical to guide future elimination efforts. We analyze the three IRS campaigns conducted during a malaria elimination demonstration project in southern Mozambique, the “ Magude project ”, and propose a new method to calculate the efficacy of IRS campaigns adjusting for IRS coverage, pace of house spraying and IRS residual efficacy on different wall types. Anopheles funestus sensu lato ( s . l .) and An . gambiae s . l . were susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl and DDT. Anopheles funestus s . l . was resistant to pyrethroids, with 24h post-exposure mortality being lower for An . funestus sensu stricto ( s . s .) than for An . parensis (collected indoors). The percentage of structures sprayed was above 90% and percentage of people covered above 86% in all three IRS campaigns. The percentage of households sprayed was above 83% in 2015 and 2016, but not assessed in 2017. Mosquito mortality 24h post-exposure stayed above 80% for 196 days after the 2016 IRS campaign and 222 days after the 2017 campaign and was 1.5 months longer on mud walls than on cement walls. This was extended by up to two months when 120h post-exposure mortality was considered. The district-level realized IRS efficacy was 113 days after the 2016 campaign. While the coverage of IRS campaigns in Magude were high, IRS protection did not remain optimal for the entire high malaria transmissions season. The use of a longer-lasting IRS product could have further supported the interruption of malaria transmission in the district. To better estimate the protection afforded by IRS campaigns, National Malaria Control Programs and partners are encouraged to adjust the calculation of IRS efficacy for IRS coverage, pace of house spraying during the campaign and IRS efficacy on different wall types combined with wall type distribution in the sprayed area."
https://openalex.org/W4300690928,"Recent years have not only seen growing public distrust in science, but also in the people conducting science. Yet, attitudes toward scientists remain largely unexplored, and the limited body of literature that exists points to an interesting ambivalence. While survey data suggest scientists to be positively evaluated (e.g., respected and trusted), research has found scientists to be perceived as capable of immoral behavior. We report two experiments aimed at identifying what contributes to this ambivalence through systematic investigations of stereotypical perceptions of scientists. In these studies, we particularly focus on two potential sources of inconsistencies in previous work: divergent operationalizations of morality (measurement effects), and different specifications of the broad group of scientists (framing effects). Results show that scientists are generally perceived as more likely to violate binding as opposed to individualizing moral foundations, and that they deviate from control groups more strongly on the latter. The extent to which different morality measures reflect the differentiation between binding and individualizing moral foundations at least partially accounts for previous contradictory findings. Moreover, the results indicate large variation in perceptions of different types of scientists: people hold more positive attitudes toward university-affiliated scientists as compared to industry-affiliated scientists, with perceptions of the ‘typical scientist’ more closely resembling the latter. Taken together, the findings have important academic ramifications for science skepticism, morality, and stereotyping research as well as valuable practical implications for successful science communication."
https://openalex.org/W4299805965,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are widely therapeutically targeted, and recent advances in allosteric modulator development at these receptors offer further potential for exploitation. Intracellular allosteric modulators (IAM) represent a class of ligands that bind to the receptor-effector interface (e.g., G protein) and inhibit agonist responses noncompetitively. This potentially offers greater selectivity between receptor subtypes compared to classical orthosteric ligands. However, while examples of IAM ligands are well described, a more general methodology for assessing compound interactions at the IAM site is lacking. Here, fluorescent labeled peptides based on the Gα peptide C terminus are developed as novel binding and activation biosensors for the GPCR-IAM site. In TR-FRET binding studies, unlabeled peptides derived from the Gαs subunit were first characterized for their ability to positively modulate agonist affinity at the β2 -adrenoceptor. On this basis, a tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) labeled tracer was synthesized based on the 19 amino acid Gαs peptide (TMR-Gαs19cha18, where cha = cyclohexylalanine). Using NanoBRET technology to detect binding, TMR-Gαs19cha18 was recruited to Gs coupled β2 -adrenoceptor and EP2 receptors in an agonist-dependent manner, but not the Gi-coupled CXCR2 receptor. Moreover, NanoBRET competition binding assays using TMR-Gαs19cha18 enabled direct assessment of the affinity of unlabeled ligands for β2 -adrenoceptor IAM site. Thus, the NanoBRET platform using fluorescent-labeled G protein peptide mimetics offers novel potential for medium-throughput screens to identify IAMs, applicable across GPCRs coupled to a G protein class. Using the same platform, Gs peptide biosensors also represent useful tools to probe orthosteric agonist efficacy and the dynamics of receptor activation."

The objective of this study was to develop a customized cost-effective SNP panel for genetic characterisation of Macrobrachium species in Cameroon. The SNPs identified in a previous characterization study were screened as viable candidates for the reduced panel. Starting from a full set of 1,814 SNPs, a total of 72 core SNPs were chosen using conventional approaches: allele frequency differentials, minor allele frequency profiles, and Wright's Fst statistics. The discriminatory power of reduced set of informative SNPs were then tested using the admixture analysis, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis of principal components. The panel of prioritised SNP markers (i.e., N = 72 SNPs) distinguished Macrobrachium species with 100% accuracy. However, large sample size is needed to identify more informative SNPs for discriminating genetically closely related species, including M. macrobrachion versus M. vollenhovenii and M. sollaudii versus M. dux. Overall, the findings in this study show that we can accurately characterise Macrobrachium using a small set of core SNPs which could be useful for this economically important species in Cameroon. Given the results obtained in this study, a larger independent validation sample set will be needed to confirm the discriminative capacity of this SNP panel for wider commercial and research applications."

We used data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) is used. MoBa is a cohort consisting of about 114 000 pregnancies (about 34000 siblings) recruited from 1999 to 2008. Self-reported measures on maternal anxiety were obtained twice in pregnancy and 6 months after birth, while paternal anxiety was reported prenatally at 17 th weeks of gestation. Maternal reports on child behaviour problems were obtained at 1.5 and 5 years of age. Results suggests that prenatal exposure to maternal anxiety was associated with behaviour problems at 1.5 years: adjusted beta (β) = 0.13 (CI = 0.12, 0.15), and at 5 years: β = 0.11 (CI = 0.09, 0.14). However, paternal anxiety was also associated with behaviour problems at 1.5 years: β = 0.03 (CI = 0.01–0.03) and at 5 years β = 0.03 (CI = 0.02, 0.03). These associations were attenuated in the sibling comparison analyses: β = - 0.02 (CI = -0.02–0.05) at 1.5 years and β = -0.05 (CI = -0.10, 0.02) at 5 years. In conclusions, the sibling analyses are not consistent with a direct effect of prenatal maternal anxiety on child behaviour problems. It is more likely that genetic or shared family environment explain this association."

A convenience sample (N = 1,557, Mage = 40.28, SDage = 19.01, 71.3% female, 80.3% White) of current or former Marlboro, Camel, or Newport users was collected. Participants were assigned to view their own brand, another brand, or a novel brand, with or without a claim, and rated perceived risk after switching to this product, product appeal, and use intentions.Participants in the RM or EM conditions had lower risk perceptions (versus control). Claim did not affect appeal. Adult established cigarette users in the EM (but not RM) condition had higher intentions (versus control). Participants rated their own and another brand as more appealing than the novel brand. Interactions between brand and claim were not significant.We found modified risk claims decreased risk perceptions but did not impact appeal. Whereas participants showed preference for their own brand in terms of appeal and intentions, brand did not moderate the impact of claims."

We previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of serine 363 in ARHGAP25 regulates hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells in mouse bone marrow. However, the significance of other potential phosphorylation sites of ARHGAP25 remained unknown. Now, we developed a novel, real-time bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay to monitor the GAP activity of ARHGAP25 in vitro. Using this approach, we revealed that phosphorylation of S363 and S488, but not that of S379-380, controls ARHGAP25's RACGAP activity. On the other hand, we found in granulocyte-differentiated human PLB-985 cells that superoxide production and actin depolymerization are regulated by residues S363 and S379-380. The present data demonstrate the value of our BRET-GAP assay and show that different phosphorylation patterns regulate ARHGAP25's GAP activity and its effect on superoxide production and phagocytosis."

However, because the relevant data of tourism to North Korea are not public, it also brings difficulties to the further study. This paper based on the Baidu Index of 31 provinces and regions in China and discusses the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of travel demands to North Korea. The findings from the research are as follows. First, the travel demands from 2011 to 2018 showed an overall trend of initial increase followed by later decrease. The seasonal difference is significant. The peak season is longer than the off-season. Secondly, on the whole, the travel demands to North Korea showed a spatial agglomeration effect, and the provinces with high demands or low demands gather significantly in space. Taking ""Hu line"" as the boundary, the east is higher than the west. The hot spot areas and cold spot areas gradually transition from east to west. Thirdly, holidays, population, GDP, per capita disposable income, Internet penetration and education are the main influencing factors of tourism demand to North Korea. By using Baidu Index, this paper overcomes the bottleneck of inaccessible tourism data to North Korea. At the same time, from the perspective of tourist source countries, this paper discusses the spatial-temporal differentiation and influencing factors of travel demands in terms of geographical space, and compares it with existing studies, expanding the research framework of China's outbound tourism."
https://openalex.org/W4300690553,"Abstract Heparin‐binding protein (HBP), as a granule protein secreted by polymorphonuclear neutrophils, participates in the pathophysiological process of sepsis. It has been reported that HBP is a biomarker of sepsis related to the severity of septic shock and organ dysfunction. HBP binds to vascular endothelial cells as a primary target site. However, it is still unclear whether HBP‐binding protein receptors exist on the surface of endothelial cells. The effect of HBP on vascular permeability in sepsis and its mechanism needs to be explored. We conducted in vivo and in vitro studies and demonstrated that HBP binds to transforming growth factor–β receptor type 2 (TGF‐β‐R2) as a ligand. Glutathione S‐transferase pull‐down analysis revealed that HBP mainly interacts with the extracellular domain of TGF‐β‐R2. HBP induces acute lung injury and vascular leakage via activation of the TGF‐β/SMAD2/3 signaling pathway. A permeability assay suggested that TGF‐β‐R2 is necessary for HBP‐induced increased permeability. We also defined the role of HBP and its potential membrane receptor TGF‐β‐R2 in the blood–gas barrier in the pathogenesis of HBP‐related acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W4300690661,"RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is an essential machinery for catalyzing mRNA synthesis and controlling cell fate in eukaryotes. Although the structure and function of RNAPII have been relatively defined, the molecular mechanism of its assembly process is not clear. The identification and functional analysis of assembly factors will provide new understanding to transcription regulation. In this study, we identify that RTR1, a known transcription regulator, is a new multicopy genetic suppressor of mutants of assembly factors Gpn3, Gpn2, and Rba50. We demonstrate that Rtr1 is directly required to assemble the two largest subunits of RNAPII by coordinating with Gpn3 and Npa3. Deletion of RTR1 leads to cytoplasmic clumping of RNAPII subunit and multiple copies of RTR1 can inhibit the formation of cytoplasmic clump of RNAPII subunit in gpn3-9 mutant, indicating a new layer function of Rtr1 in checking proper assembly of RNAPII. In addition, we find that disrupted activity of Rtr1 phosphatase does not trigger the formation of cytoplasmic clump of RNAPII subunit in a catalytically inactive mutant of RTR1. Based on these results, we conclude that Rtr1 cooperates with Gpn3 and Npa3 to assemble RNAPII core."

It suggests that confidence, namely the post-decision estimate of being correct, should be lower than positives. We asked participants to pick the larger single-digit numeral in a pair and collected their implicit confidence with button pressure (button pressure was validated with three empirical signatures of confidence). We also modeled their choices with a drift-diffusion decision model to compute the post-decision estimate of being correct. We found that participants had relatively low confidence with negative numerals. Given that participants compared with high accuracy the basic base-10 symbols (0-9), reduced confidence may be a general feature of manipulating abstract negative numerals as they produce more uncertainty than positive numerals per unit of time."
