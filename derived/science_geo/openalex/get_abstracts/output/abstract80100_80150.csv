https://openalex.org/W2032790020,"The human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III) appears to be central to the causation of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two full-length integrated proviral DNA forms of HTLV-III have now been cloned and analyzed, and DNA sequences of the virus in cell lines and fresh tissues from patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) have been characterized. The results revealed that (i) HTLV-III is an exogenous human retrovirus, approximately 10 kilobases in length, that lacks nucleic acid sequences derived from normal human DNA; (ii) HTLV-III, unlike HTLV types I and II, shows substantial diversity in its genomic restriction enzyme cleavage pattern; (iii) HTLV-III persists in substantial amounts in cells as unintegrated linear DNA, an uncommon property that has been linked to the cytopathic effects of certain animal retroviruses; and (iv) HTLV-III viral DNA can be detected in low levels in fresh (primary) lymphoid tissue of a minority of patients with AIDS or ARC but appears not to be present in Kaposi's sarcoma tissue. These findings have important implications concerning the biological properties of HTLV-III and the pathophysiology of AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma."

https://openalex.org/W2027691963,"The genome of the small human virus serologically associated with erythrocyte aplasia and erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) is shown to be a linear, nonpermuted, single-stranded DNA molecule with self-priming hairpin termini, properties which are characteristic of the genomes of the family Parvoviridae. This human parvovirus chromosome was molecularly cloned into bacterial plasmid vectors and the cloned DNA was used to explore its relatedness to other mammalian parvovirus serotypes by DNA:DNA hybridization. It is not related to the human adeno-associated viruses but does show a distant evolutionary relationship to genomes of the helper-independent parvoviruses of rodents. This strongly suggests that it is an autonomous parvovirus, and as such is the first example of a member of this group of common animal pathogens to cause disease in man."
https://openalex.org/W2050529323,"Interstitial pneumonia linked with reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus due to iatrogenic immunosuppression can be a serious complication of bone marrow transplantation therapy of aplastic anaemia and acute leukaemia. Cellular immunity plays a critical role in the immune surveillance of inapparent cytomegalovirus infections in man and the mouse. The molecular basis of latency, however, and the interaction between latently or recurrently infected cells and the immune system of the host are poorly understood. We have detected a so far unknown antigen in the mouse model. This antigen is found in infected cells in association with the expression of the herpesvirus 'immediate early' genes and is recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). We now demonstrate that an unexpectedly high proportion of the CTL precursors generated in vivo during acute murine cytomegalovirus infection are specific for cells that selectively synthesize immediate early proteins, indicating an immunodominant role of viral non-structural proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2017553725,"The entire Epstein-Barr virus genome is integrated into Burkitt tumor cell DNA at the terminal direct repeat sequence of the virus. There is no homology between the GC-rich (G, guanine; C, cytosine) terminal repeat and the AT-rich (A, adenine; T, thymine) cell sequences with which it has recombined. More than 15 kilobases of cell DNA have been deleted and 236 base pairs are duplicated at one virus-cell junction site."
https://openalex.org/W1509743989,"We have investigated the basis for the specific recognition of lysosomal enzymes by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase. This enzyme is responsible for the selective phosphorylation of mannose residues on lysosomal enzymes. Two mammalian lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin D and uteroferrin, and two nonlysosomal glycoproteins were treated with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H to remove those high mannose oligosaccharide units which are accessible on the native protein. These proteins were then tested as inhibitors of three different glycosyltransferases. The endo H-treated lysosomal enzymes were shown to be specific inhibitors of the phosphorylation of intact lysosomal enzymes. Proteolytic fragments of cathepsin D, including the entire light chain and heavy chain, did not retain the ability to be recognized by the N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase. These findings indicate that the intact protein portion of lysosomal enzymes contains a specific recognition determinant which leads to high-affinity binding to the N-acetylglucosaminylphosphotransferase. The expression of this determinant appears to be dependent on the conformation of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2060911965,"A transposable genetic element of the P family in Drosophila melanogaster was found to be unstable in the presence of other P elements but stable in their absence. A sensitive assay for P transpositional activity is provided by the snw allele, a defective P insert in the singed bristle locus which becomes hypermutable only in the presence of complete elements. This measure of activity was highly correlated with a type of female sterility normally associated with P activity. There was no cross-reactivity with transposase from another hybrid dysgenesis-causing element (the I factor)."
https://openalex.org/W1518765257,"Monensin blocks human transferrin recycling in a dose-dependent and reversible manner in K562 cells, reaching 100% inhibition at a noncytocidal dose of 10(-5) M, whereas transferrin recycling is virtually unaffected by noncytocidal doses of chloroquine. The intracellular pathway of human transferrin in K562 cells, both in the presence and absence of 10(-5) M monensin, was localized by indirect immunofluorescence. Monensin blocks transferrin recycling by causing internalized ligand to accumulate in the perinuclear region of the cell. The effect of 10(-5) M monensin on human transferrin kinetics was quantitatively measured by radioimmunoassay and showed a positive correlation with immunofluorescent studies. Immunoelectron microscopic localization of human transferrin as it cycles through K562 cells reveals the appearance of perinuclear transferrin-positive multivesicular bodies within 3 min of internalization, with subsequent exocytic delivery of the ligand to the cell surface via transferrin-staining vesicles arising from these perinuclear structures within 5 min of internalization. Inhibition of ligand recycling with 10(-5) M monensin causes dilated transferrin-positive multivesicular bodies to accumulate within the cell with no evidence of recycling vesicles. A coordinated interaction between multivesicular bodies and the Golgi apparatus appears to be involved in the recycling of transferrin in K562 cells. Cell-surface-binding sites for transferrin were reduced by 50% with 10(-5) M monensin treatment; however, this effect was not attenuated by 80% protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide, supporting the idea that the transferrin receptor is also recycled through the Golgi."

https://openalex.org/W2047615149,A cloned complementary DNA derived from a messenger RNA transiently present at low abundance levels in early chick embryonic skeletal muscle hybridizes to a messenger RNA present at high abundance levels in cardiac muscle. Genomic DNA hybridization and nucleotide sequence identity of complementary DNA's from both heart and skeletal muscle demonstrate that the messenger RNA's from both sources are encoded by the same gene. The encoded polypeptide is a troponin T sequence which is probably a cardiac isoform. This single copy troponin T isogene is governed by different regulatory programs in heart and skeletal muscle differentiation.
https://openalex.org/W1579328338,"An immunoabsorbent column, prepared by covalently linking mouse monoclonal anti-calf thymus DNA polymerase-alpha to Protein A-Sepharose, was used as the primary purification step for rapid isolation of DNA polymerase-alpha from calf thymus-gland extracts. In a 4-step procedure consisting of the removal of nucleic acids by protamine sulfate precipitation, chromatography on the immunoabsorbent column, desalting on Sephadex G-50, and removal of bovine immunoglobulins on Protein A-Sepharose, DNA polymerase-alpha activity was purified about 5000-fold from the crude extract with greater than 40% recovery of total enzyme activity. The antibody column-purified DNA polymerase-alpha fraction contains a DNA primase activity that is efficient in replication of single-stranded DNA and poly(dT) when rNTPs are included in the replication reactions. Synthesis by calf thymus DNA polymerase-primase is totally dependent on added template. Complete replication of circular single-stranded phage DNA is achieved with polymerase-primase producing a nicked circular DNA containing oligoribonucleotide primer in the final product. Primers synthesized with single-stranded phage DNA as template were up to 10 nucleotides long when dNTPs were omitted from the reaction and 8 or less nucleotides long when dNTPs were present. Primers synthesized using poly(dT) consisted of three populations when dATP was absent from the reaction, averaging 20 nucleotides, 10 nucleotides, and 3-4 nucleotides. The 20-nucleotide population was not found when dATP was included in the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1521699968,"Two types of RNA polymerase activity were isolated from Euglena gracilis chloroplasts and compared. One polymerase is tightly bound to chloroplast DNA; this complex is called the transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) (Rushlow, K. E., Orozco, E. M., Jr., Lipper, C., and Hallick, R. B. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3786-3792). The other activity is found in a soluble extract of Euglena chloroplasts. The soluble extract is dependent upon an exogenous DNA template for activity. The two activities can be isolated in two distinct subchloroplast fractions from a single chloroplast preparation. The soluble extract is selective for transcription of transfer RNA genes, whereas the TAC is selective for ribosomal RNA genes. TAC and the soluble extract respond differently to KCl and Mg2+. The soluble extract is sensitive to heparin, and TAC is resistant. The two activities have different temperature optima. Based on this evidence, we conclude that Euglena chloroplasts have at least two distinct RNA polymerase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1602958737,"When gastric microsomes were purified from resting and stimulated rabbit mucosae, they were found to be generally similar in (H+ + K+)-ATPase activity, peptide composition in single-dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and in size. In the stimulated vesicles, optimal proton transport activity was found at pH 7.4, 20-50 mM KCl, and 1 mM ATP-Mg. However, in the case of resting vesicles, the presence of valinomycin and an inward Cl-gradient was also necessary for Mg-ATP-dependent proton transport. Measurement of K+ and Cl-diffusion potentials using 3,3-dipropylthiadicarboxocyanine iodide as a potential sensitive dye showed that both resting and stimulated vesicles developed K+ gradient-dependent potentials in the presence of an impermeant anion, but that Cl- gradient-dependent potentials were observed only in the stimulated preparation. 86Rb+ self-exchange was found in both types of vesicles, but Cl- self-exchange was confined to vesicles derived from stimulated mucosae. Putative inhibitors of anion conductance such as furosemide and anthracene 9-carboxylic acid blocked proton transport, Cl- conductance, 36Cl- uptake, and Cl- exchange. The inhibition of proton transport was overcome by valinomycin. ATPase activity in the presence of nigericin, an H+:K+ exchanger, was unaffected by these inhibitors. K+ conductance, Rb+ uptake, and Rb+ exchange were insensitive to these inhibitors. Thus, activation of acid secretion by the stimulated parietal cell appears to involve at least the appearance of a discrete Cl- conductance in the pump-associated membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1603096028,"The human alpha 1 (I) collagen gene and 48 kilobase pairs of flanking DNA have been isolated on two overlapping cosmids. The alpha 1 (I) gene is 18 kilobase pairs long and contains a single repetitive element of the Alu family; at least 15 repetitive elements are present in the flanking DNA. Analysis of chromatin structure in nuclei isolated from cultured fibroblasts demonstrated a single chromatin domain greater than 65 kilobase pairs in length that contained 9 DNase I-hypersensitive sites. The pattern of hypersensitive sites was also determined in nuclei derived from placental tissue. Five of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites were observed in both placental and fibroblast chromatin including one site near the 5' end and another near the 3' end of alpha 1 (I). An additional two sites located near the 3' end of the alpha 1 (I) gene in fibroblast chromatin are associated with the tissue-specific use of different polyadenylation sites. Two DNase I-hypersensitive sites found only in fibroblast chromatin and one site found only in placental chromatin were located more than 10 kilobase pairs away from the alpha 1 (I) gene and may be related to tissue-specific expression of other genes in the domain. However, the only abundant placental mRNAs from the 65-kilobase pair domain were those transcribed from the alpha 1 (I) gene. These findings suggest that physical linkage does not play a predominant role in controlling coordinate expression of collagen genes."

https://openalex.org/W2082777817,"The regulation of expression of the family of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I genes is complex. Sequence analysis has revealed that class I genes from the H-2D subregion of the MHC (which includes the D and L genes) differ from the class I gene from the H-2K subregion (the K gene) by the insertion of a type 2 Alu-like repetitive element (the murine B2 sequence) within the 3′ noncoding region of the D and L genes. The consequence of this insertion in the D and L genes is the introduction of a novel polyadenylation signal, which is preferentially used over the more distal signal, the analog of that found in the K gene. The insertion of the type 2 Alu-like sequence results in a change in the preferred site for endonucleolytic cleavage which is necessary for generating a correct 3′ terminus for polyadenylation. The data demonstrate that the type 2 Alu-like sequence has a function; the data also suggest a possible regulatory role of this sequence in the expression of class I genes."
https://openalex.org/W2035205184,"The protein encoded by the simian sarcoma virus oncogene (v-sis) contains a signal sequence, derived from the envelope gene of the parental retrovirus, which is required for transformation. Removal of the proposed signal sequence was correlated with loss of biological activity. This activity was restored to inactive deletion mutants by fusion with the coding region for a heterologous signal sequence. Biological activity of v-sis was also abolished by either a small deletion within the coding region of the signal sequence or by a point mutation introduced by site-directed mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1587642359,"Choline kinase was purified from rat kidney to apparent homogeneity with respect to both native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme showed a minimum molecular weight of 42,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, the molecular size of 75,000-80,000 was estimated through Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, indicating that the enzyme in rat kidney exists most likely in a dimeric form. Specific antibody was raised in rabbit against the highly purified rat kidney choline kinase protein, then immunochemical cross-reactivity was investigated between rabbit antiserum and choline kinase preparations from various rat tissues. The antiserum inhibited choline kinase activity almost completely in the crude preparation not only from kidney but also from lung, intestine, and normal untreated liver cytosol, but it could inhibit only partially the activity from either 3-methylcholanthrene- or carbon tetrachloride-induced rat liver cytosol. The overall results demonstrated that, although choline kinase protein appears to exist in multiple forms in rat tissues, most of them are immunochemically identical, and that either 3-methylcholanthrene- or carbon tetrachloride-inducible form(s) of choline kinase in rat liver could be quite different from a form or forms existing in normal untreated rat liver cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1664850085,"Regulation of the Escherichia coli dapD gene involved in diaminopimelate and lysine biosynthesis was unknown as no convenient enzymatic assay was available until recently. This gene was cloned into pBR322 from a lambda transducing phage; its complete nucleotide sequence was established. This sequence shows that the dapD gene is composed of a single cistron encoding a 274-amino acid polypeptide, Mr 30,040. Enzymatic activity measurements show that this gene encodes the tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase which catalyzes the third step of the specific lysine-diaminopimelate pathway. The transcriptional start of the dapD gene was localized; the identified promoter signals are weak compared to those from the E. coli promoter consensus sequence. The dapD gene-coding sequence is followed by a typical rho-independent transcriptional termination sequence. A study using an operon fusion constructed in vitro between the dapD promoter and the galK structural gene indicated that dapD gene expression is repressed by lysine; no attenuation-like sequence can be found to account for this regulation. At the present time, out of the 9 genes involved in diaminopimelate and lysine biosynthesis, 6 are known to be lysine regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1524417745,"The Escherichia coli dapB gene encodes dihydrodipicolinate reductase. This enzyme is part of the diaminopimelate-lysine pathway, and its synthesis is repressed by lysine. The dapB gene was cloned into pBR322 from a transducing lambda bacteriophage, its complete nucleotide sequence established, and the transcriptional start localized. The DNA sequence predicts that the dapB gene codes for a 273-amino acid polypeptide, Mr 28,798. No attenuation-type sequence can be found between the mRNA start and the coding sequence. The dapB promoter signals appear to be weak as compared to RNA polymerase consensus sequences. Nevertheless an efficient in vivo synthesis of beta-galactosidase was obtained when the lac operon was inserted in vitro in the dapB gene, downstream of the dapB regulatory signals. Further studies were performed on an in-frame gene fusion constructed in vitro between the dapB and the lacZ genes. They indicated that repression by lysine is exerted on a DNA region restricted to a 153-base pair fragment with only 102 nontranscribed nucleotides. Finally, dapB gene expression showed a gene dosage effect which suggests that it is not controlled by an element present in limiting amounts in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1505089585,"We have isolated mRNA from a human pancreatic islet cell tumor and have identified among the cell-free translation products a precursor of pancreatic polypeptide with an approximate Mr = 11,000. Recombinant DNA molecules encoding this precursor were selected from a cDNA library prepared from the islet tumor mRNA. From the nucleotide sequences of cDNAs encoding the precursor, we have deduced the complete amino acid sequence of pre-propancreatic polypeptide. These sequences encode a protein consisting of 95 amino acid residues with a Mr = 10,432. The sequence of human pancreatic polypeptide occurs in the middle of the precursor and is flanked at its carboxyl terminus by a 27-amino acid sequence which is similar to a peptide previously isolated from canine pancreatic islets. At the amino terminus of the precursor is a probable leader sequence which is rich in hydrophobic residues. A smaller pancreatic polypeptide-related protein was generated in cell-free translations of mRNA supplemented with microsomal membranes. Sequential Edman degradations of this smaller peptide indicate that the sequence of pancreatic polypeptide is located at the amino terminus of the prohormone."

https://openalex.org/W1480407769,"The spin-labeling reagent, N4-(9'-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-4-amino-1-oxyl-4-succinimidyloxyca rbonyl- 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, and the same enriched in 14C at the 4-formyl group, were synthesized as new acylating compounds for protein amino groups that can preserve charge. Porcine testicular calmodulin was modified with this reagent at pH 7.8 in the presence of Ca2+ under conditions that yielded a fairly homogeneous derivative as judged by electrophoretic analysis and tryptic digestion patterns. The tryptic peptides were separated by gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the resulting, highly purified 14C-labeled peptides were hydrolyzed and their amino acid compositions determined. The results indicate that at least 87% of the modifications occur at lysyl residues 75 and 148, and the former appears to be the most reactive. This bilabeled calmodulin adduct does not activate a bovine brain cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase preparation. The fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl portion of this inactive calmodulin derivative can, however, be removed by conditions that do not diminish native calmodulin activity in the phosphodiesterase assay. The resulting calmodulin adduct is active in the enzymic assay, although with diminished potency compared to calmodulin. The specificity of the reaction of this acylating reagent with calmodulin may be due to recognition of the tricyclic fluorene ring by the phenothiazine-binding sites since it was found that trifluoperazine inhibited the labeling reaction. Also, calmodulin was far more reactive to this reagent than were several other proteins. This is the first report of a specific, characterized lysine modification on calmodulin, and it is possible that other phenothiazine-binding proteins may also exhibit similar selectivity for acylation. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the calmodulin adducts suggest a high degree of spin immobilization in both the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-saturated states."
https://openalex.org/W1662139509,"We have used stable transformation of a cloned Drosophila hsp70 gene into mouse Ltk- cells as an assay system to determine which sequences are involved in the temperature-induced transcription of the gene. We have analyzed the effect of different external deletions on the ability of the gene to be transcribed after temperature elevation. We have also constructed chimeric genes containing different sequences of the hsp70 promoter region joined to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, and we have studied the heat-shock inducibility of the thymidine kinase gene after transformation into mouse cells. Our results suggest that the heat-shock genes are under negative control and that their activation is the result of a derepression of the gene. In addition, our experiments indicate that the heat-shock consensus sequence is necessary but not sufficient for temperature-induced transcription, and its role seems to be functionally similar to other transcription signals (i.e. the CAT box) located upstream from the TATA box in several eukaryotic genes. We are proposing that there are two additional regulatory elements besides the consensus sequence which must be present for proper temperature-dependent transcription to occur. Either one of these elements, which are located on opposite sides of the TATA box, may serve at any one time to ensure transcription; that is, only one at a time is needed for proper expression of the heat-shock gene."
https://openalex.org/W1523485594,"The hormonal regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was examined in granulosa cells from diethylstilbestrol-implanted immature rats. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increased the number of available cAMP-binding sites in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with a maximum 4-6-fold increase at 50-100 ng/ml between 6 and 48 h of culture after a transient decrease in available sites during the first 6 h. The potent gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist [D - Ala6]des - Gly10 - GnRH - N - ethylamide (GnRHa) reduced the FSH-induced increase in cAMP-binding sites by approximately 50% at 24 and 48 h of culture. Photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P] cAMP revealed the existence of one major cAMP-binding protein (Mr = 55,000 +/- 400) which appeared to be the regulatory (R) subunit of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. While FSH induced a 5-10-fold increase in the labeling of R II both in vivo and in vitro, GnRHa reduced the amount of R II induced by FSH in granulosa cells cultured for 48 h. The large increase in R II subunit was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in protein kinase activity, which was only enhanced by 50% after 48 h of culture with FSH. Fractionation of granulosa cell cytosol from FSH-treated ovaries on DEAE-cellulose showed a single peak of cAMP-dependent phosphokinase activity with the elution properties of a type II protein kinase. However, the peak of cAMP binding activity (eluted at 0.20 M KCl) was not coincident with the protein kinase activity. FSH transiently stimulated cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity during the first 10-30 min of culture. GnRHa impaired the FSH-induced early increase in protein kinase activity, causing a delay in activation until 60 min. These findings suggest that a large dose- and time-dependent increase in the content of cAMP-binding sites may be a major factor in cAMP-mediated differentiation of granulosa cells. The inhibitory effect of GnRHa on both FSH-induced protein kinase activation during the first minutes of culture and on FSH-induced R II synthesis during the subsequent 48 h of culture could be crucial events in the prevention of granulosa cell maturation by GnRH agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1585291114,"The binding of 125I-cholecystokinin-33 (125I-CCK-33) to its receptors on rat pancreatic membranes was decreased by modification of membrane protein sulfhydryl groups. Sulfhydryl modifying reagents also caused an accelerated release of bound 125I-CCK-33 from its receptor. Because of the presence of an essential sulfhydryl group(s) in CCK receptor binding we studied the application of the heterobifunctional (SH,NH2) cross-linker, m-maleimidobenzoyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), to affinity label 125I-CCK-33 binding proteins on rat pancreatic plasma membranes. Analysis of the cross-linked products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed that this heterobifunctional cross-linker affinity labeled a major Mr = 80,000-95,000 protein previously identified as part of the CCK receptor on the basis of affinity labeling using homobifunctional and heterobifunctional photoreactive cross-linkers. Additional proteins of Mr greater than 200,000, and Mr = 130,000-140,000 were affinity labeled using MBS. The efficiency of the cross-linking reaction between 125I-CCK-33 and its membrane binding proteins with MBS was significantly greater than that obtained with NH2-directed homobifunctional reagents such as disuccinimidyl suberate. The efficiency of cross-linking could be dramatically improved by reduction of membrane proteins with low-molecular weight thiols prior to binding and cross-linking. The differential labeling patterns of the CCK binding proteins obtained with chemical cross-linkers of similar length but different chemical reactivity underscores the need for caution in predicting native receptor structure from affinity labeling data alone. Using the same pancreatic plasma membrane preparation and 125I-insulin, the Mr = 125,000 alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor was affinity labeled using MBS as cross-linker, demonstrating its utility in identifying other peptide hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1665370707,"Abstract An 820-nucleotide-long cDNA clone for the kappa-casein (the casein micelle-stabilizing protein) from rat mammary gland was isolated, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence from the nucleotide sequence revealed a signal peptide, 21 amino acids long, and a mature protein of 157 amino acids. The signal peptide of rat kappa-casein was highly homologous to that of the precursor to ovine kappa-casein. However, little homology was apparent when the mature kappa-casein protein sequences from ovine or bovine sources were compared with rat kappa-casein. The kappa-casein mRNA content of the mammary tissue was found to increase during its functional differentiation. Prolactin appears to modulate the production of kappa-casein mRNA. Mammary glands of virgin females had no detectable kappa-casein mRNA; however, a marked induction of kappa-casein mRNA was obtained by intravenous infusion of prolactin. Mammary carcinomas did not follow the same pattern. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary carcinomas had normally low levels of kappa-casein mRNA, but intravenous prolactin infusion increased the levels by 2-fold. The MTW9 mammary carcinoma that grows only in the presence of high levels of mammotropic hormones had kappa-casein mRNA content equivalent to that in 10-day lactating rat mammary gland. Continuous venous infusion of prolactin to MTW9 mammary carcinoma did not modify the kappa-casein mRNA levels. Nitrosomethylurea-induced mammary carcinomas had no detectable kappa-casein mRNA, and intravenous prolactin infusion was unable to induce it."
https://openalex.org/W1597031249,"Evidence is presented that isoproterenol treatment of rat C6 glioma cells, under conditions that increase glioma cell cAMP levels, causes the phosphorylative modification of several RNA polymerase II subunits. RNA polymerase II in control and isoproterenol-stimulated 32Pi-labeled confluent glioma cells was immunoprecipitated from ribonuclease-treated nuclear extracts with hen anti-calf RNA polymerase II antiserum conjugated to Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated RNA polymerase II was analyzed for 32P-labeled subunits by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Using this technique, we have shown that isoproterenol causes a time-dependent increase of phosphate incorporation into RNA polymerase II subunits of 214,000, 180,000, 140,000, 35,000, 28,000, and 16,500 daltons. Phosphate incorporation occurred exclusively on serine in all of the six subunits. About 0.5-2 mol of phosphate/mol of RNA polymerase II subunit were incorporated. Dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3)M) mimics the stimulatory action of isoproterenol and mediates increased phosphate incorporation into the six subunits. (RS)-propranolol (10(-4)M) prevents the isoproterenol-mediated phosphorylative changes. These data indicate that isoproterenol, via cAMP, mediates a transient structural modification of RNA polymerase II subunits in rat C6 glioma cells which may possibly lead to a modulation of RNA polymerase II function(s)."
