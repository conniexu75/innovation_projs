https://openalex.org/W2067956561,"We have studied the transient expression of a cloned rabbit hemoglobin β1 gene after its introduction into HeLa cells. Two and one-half days after transfection using the calcium phosphate technique, we extracted RNA from the entire cell population and analyzed it by the S1 nuclease hybridization assay. Transcripts were barely detectable when β-globin gene-plasmid recombinants were used. However, 200 times more β-globin gene transcripts were found when the β-globin gene recombinants also contained SV40 DNA, and 90% of these transcripts (about 1000 per cell) had the same 5′ end as authentic rabbit globin mRNA. In the latter case, abundant production of β-globin protein was readily detected in a fraction of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining. Enhancement of globin gene expression was dependent on SV40 sequences acting in cis, but independent of the viral origin of DNA replication. The enhancing activity was associated with the 72 bp repeated sequence element located at the beginning of the viral late gene region. Viral DNA fragments containing the transcriptional enhancer element could act in either orientation at many positions, including 1400 bp upstream or 3300 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site of the rabbit β-globin gene. These studies define a class of DNA elements with a mode of action that has not been heretofore described. The activation of genes by specific enhancer elements seems to be a widespread mechanism that may be used for the regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2028143792,"The adenovirus E1b-58kd tumor antigen has been detected in a physical association with a 54 kilodalton cellular protein in adenovirus-transformed mouse cells. Antibody specific for the E1b-58kd protein coimmunoprecipitates a 54 kd protein from transformed, but not from productively infected, cells. Monoclonal antibody specific for the cellular 54 kd protein coimmunoprecipitates the adenovirus E1b-58kd protein from transformed cell extracts. The same or closely related cellular 54 kd protein, associated with the adenovirus E1b-58kd protein, was present in the SV40 large T antigen-54 kd complex previously detected in SV40-transformed mouse cells. The identity of the 54 kd protein is based on the immunological specificities of the anti-54 kd monoclonal antibodies and partial peptide maps of the 54 kd protein associated with the adenovirus and SV40 tumor antigens. The adenovirus E1b-58kd-54 kd complex, like the SV40 large T antigen-54 kd complex, is heterogeneous in size or mass. While all of the cellular 54 kd protein in the adenovirus-transformed cell extract is found in a complex with the E1b-58kd protein, some of the viral 58 kd antigen is detected in a form not associated with the 54 kd protein. The fact that the adenovirus and Sv40 tumor antigens, both required for transformation, can be found in physical association with the same cellular protein in a transformed cell is a good indication that these two diverse viral proteins share some common mechanisms or functions."
https://openalex.org/W2109030204,"We have developed a rapid and simple method for studying the transcription of cloned eucaryotic genes, which involves transfecting SV40-transformed monkey cell lines (COS cells) with derivatives of the plasmid pBR322 that contain the SV40 viral replication origin but lack regions necessary for viral transcription (SV-ORI vectors). Because COS cells produce SV40 T antigen and are permissive for SV40 viral replication, transfected SV-ORI plasmids replicate to a high copy number. SV-ORI plasmids carrying a human alpha-globin gene are also replicated in COS cells. Moreover, the alpha-globin gene is faithfully transcribed to produce high levels of RNA, which is accurately processed to produce authentic alpha-globin mRNA. We have used this transcription system to demonstrate that a sequence located between 55 and 87 base pairs upstream from the mRNA capping site is required for efficient transcription of the alpha-globin gene in COS cells."

https://openalex.org/W2088653018,"The structure of immunoglobulin-related genes was analyzed in individual Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed lymphoid cell lines. Essentially all of these lines, whether immunoglobulin-containing or null, had DNA rearrangements in the vicinity of the JH regions on both chromosomes as well as deletions of at least 5 kb of DNA 5′ to JH. None of these lines, however, except rare light chain producers, had detectable rearrangements at either their κ or λ light chain loci. In contrast to A-MuLV-transformants derived from bone marrow, those from early fetal liver frequently contained more than two and sometimes 12 or more distinct, rearranged JH-containing fragments. Cellular subclones derived from these lines had a subset, usually two, of the fragments found in the parent line. Therefore, heavy chain gene rearrangement appears to precede that of light chain gene rearrangement and is still continuing in certain cultured A-MuLV transformants."
https://openalex.org/W1549578642,"Energy-dependent proteolysis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates has an absolute requirement for both ATP and ubiquitin that is believed due to the ATP-dependent covalent conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) to substrate proteins as a signal event. Recently the enzyme responsible for activation of ubiquitin has been purified to near homogeneity by covalent affinity chromatography. In the present work we demonstrate that the enzyme catalyzes the net reaction (formula: see text); in which both an enzyme-bound COOH-terminal ubiquitin thiolester and a COOH-terminal ubiquitin adenylate are formed. The complex is sufficiently stable to be isolated by exclusion chromatography and contains ubiquitin/AMP in a ratio of 2. The presence of two forms of covalently linked ubiquitin provides a rationale for the observation of both ubiquitin-dependent ATP:PPi and ATP:AMP exchange. Selective derivatization of the thiol site with iodoacetamide results in a modified enzyme capable of catalyzing only ATP:PPi exchange and in forming only ubiquitin adenylate. Derivatization of the thiol site prevents conjugate formation in a reconstituted system, demonstrating that the ubiquitin thiolester is the proximal donor for subsequent conjugate formation. A three-step mechanism is proposed for ubiquitin activation by the enzyme prior to conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W1983970621,"We have a new approach, two-dimensional hybridization mapping of nucleosomes, to compare the structures of mononucleosomes from different regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Approximately one in two nucleosomes of the transcribed copia and heat-shock 70 (hsp 70) genes in nonshocked cultured cells contains ubiquitin-H2A (uH2A) semihistone, a covalent conjugate of histone H2A and a small protein, ubiquitin. In striking contrast, less than one in 25 nucleosomes of tandemly repeated, nontranscribed 1.688 satellite DNA contains uH2A, suggesting that most of the nucleosomal uH2A is located in transcribed genes. Approximately 25% of all nucleosomes are ubiquitinated in nonsynchronized cultured Drosophila cells. The hsp 70 genes in nonshocked cells occur in nucleosomes, are greatly enriched in uH2A and are not digested preferentially by staphylococcal nuclease. In contrast, the same genes in chromatin from heat-shocked cells are highly sensitive to staphylococcal nuclease and no longer possess nucleosomal organization recognizable with this probe. Histone ubiquitination in transcribed nucleosomes may prevent formation of higher order chromosomal structures by modifying nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. The observed loss of nucleosomal organization in very actively transcribed genes, such as the hsp 70 genes in shocked cells, may be related to the recent finding that ubiquitin conjugates are substrates for the cytoplasmic ATP-dependent proteolytic system. We have also found that 1.688 satellite mononucleotomes contain a specific approximately 50,000 dalton nonhistone protein, D1, in addition to being extremely under-ubiquitinated. D1 may be involved in formation of the highly compact structure of satellite heterochromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1549397399,"This paper describes a rapid two-step procedure for the purification of the low density lipoprotein receptor from bovine adrenal cortex membranes. After solubilization with nonionic detergents, the receptor adheres tightly to a DEAE-cellulose column at pH 6. Following elution from DEAE-cellulose, detergent is removed, leaving the receptor in a soluble form. The receptor is then subjected to affinity chromatography on low density lipoprotein coupled to Sepharose 4B. The receptor is eluted with suramin, a newly-found inhibitor of low density lipoprotein-receptor interactions. This procedure yields a single protein with a molecular weight of 164,000. The same protein is also isolated when the crude DEAE-cellulose fraction is applied to an immunoaffinity column containing a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor. The 164,000-dalton receptor protein has an acidic isoelectric point of 4.6, which rises to 4.8 after extensive treatment with neuraminidase. The purified receptor retains all of the binding properties of the receptor of intact cells and crude membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2146437721,"We have previously described an enzyme that activates ubiquitin, the heat-stable polypeptide of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system from reticulocytes (Ciechanover, A., Heller, H., Katz-Etzion, R., and Hershko, A. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 761-765). It carries out ubiquitin-dependent PPi-ATP and AMP-ATP exchange reactions and binds to the activated polypeptide by a thiolester linkage. We describe here a procedure for the purification of this enzyme by its binding to ubiquitin-Sepharose. Binding of the enzyme to the column requires ATP and Mg2+, and bound enzyme cannot be displaced by high salt but can be eluted by raising the pH, by increased concentrations of a thiol compound, or by the joint supplementation of AMP and pyrophosphate. Another form of the enzyme that cannot carry out AMP-ATP exchange (but catalyzes ubiquitin-dependent PPi-ATP exchange) does not bind to the column. These data indicate that a covalent, possibly thiolester intermediate, is formed between the activating enzyme and Sepharose-bound ubiquitin. It is suggested designating this procedure of enzyme isolation covalent affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme has an apparent Mr = 210,000 and appears to be composed of two subunits of Mr = 105, 000. ATP-dependent binding of ubiquitin to the purified enzyme and to its subunit is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1665305383,"The flavoprotein mercuric reductase catalyzes the two-electron reduction of mercuric ions to elemental mercury using NADPH as an electron donor. It has now been purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO9501 carrying the plasmid pVS1. In this plasmid system, where the mer operon is on the transposon Tn501, mercuric reductase comprises up to 6% of the soluble cellular protein upon induction with mercurials. The purification is a rapid (two-step), high yield (80%) procedure. Anaerobic titrations of mercuric reductase with dithionite revealed the formation of a charge transfer complex with an absorbance maximum around 540 nm. Striking spectroscopic similarities to lipoamide dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase were observed. These two enzymes, which catalyze the transfer of electrons between pyridine nucleotides and disulfides, are flavoproteins which contain an oxidation-reduction-active cysteine residue at the active site. The expectation that mercuric reductase contains a similar electron acceptor was confirmed when it was shown that mercuric reductase has the capacity to accept four electrons per FAD-containing subunit, and that two thiols become kinetically titrable by 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) upon reduction with NADPH. These are characteristic features of the disulfide reductase class of flavoproteins. Further similarities with at least one of these enzymes, lipoamide dehydrogenase, include the E/EH2 midpoint potential (-269 mV), fluorescence properties, and extinction coefficients of E and EH2. Preliminary observations relevant to an understanding of the mechanism of mercuric reductase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1584363878,"Confluent monolayer cultures of the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line have been shown to possess a furosemide and bumetanide-sensitive (Na+,K+)-cotransport system. We have studied the effect of anion substitutions on (Na+,K+)-cotransport. In Na+-depleted cells, bumetanide-sensitive uptake of 22Na+ or 86Rb+ exhibited an absolute requirement for extracellular Cl-. Chloride could be replaced in the buffers by Br-, but not by F-, I-, acetate, nitrate, thiocyanate, sulfate, or gluconate. The effect of Cl- was saturating, and Na+-stimulated 86RB+ uptake as well as K+-stimulated 22Na+ uptake was shown to be dependent on the square of the Cl- concentration. The concentration of Cl- which gave half-maximal stimulation of cation cotransport varied between 58 and 70 mM. There was a small degree of cooperativity between the binding affinities for Cl- and K+ at constant Na+ concentrations. Bumetanide-sensitive 36Cl- uptake could be demonstrated when extracellular Na+ and K+ were present simultaneously. Uptake through this system was unaffected by changes in the membrane potential or by the imposition of pH gradients. Together these data strongly suggest that the bumetanide-sensitive transport system in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells co-transports Na+, K+, and Cl- in a ratio of 1:1:2."
https://openalex.org/W1489157210,"Human platelet adenylate cyclase is stimulated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and is inhibited by epinephrine via alpha-adrenoceptors. Both agonists, epinephrine more than PGE1, increase the activity of a low Km GTPase in platelet membranes. Pretreatment of intact platelets or platelet membranes with the sulfhydryl reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), abolished the inhibition of the adenylate cyclase and the concomitant stimulation of the GTPase by epinephrine. In contrast, stimulation of the adenylate cyclase by PGE1 was not affected or even increased by NEM pretreatment; only at high NEM concentrations were both basal and PGE1-stimulated activities decreased. Similarly, the PGE1-induced activation of the low Km GTPase was not or was only partially reduced by NEM. Adenylate cyclase activation by stable GTP analogs, NaF, and cholera toxin was also not decreased by NEM pretreatment. Exposure of intact platelets to NEM did not reduce alpha-adrenoceptor number and affinities for agonists and antagonists, as determined by [3H]yohimbine binding in platelet particles. The data indicate that NEM uncouples alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of platelet adenylate cyclase, leaving the receptor recognition site and the adenylate cyclase itself relatively intact. Although the effect of NEM may be based on a reaction with the alpha-adrenoceptor site interacting with a coupling component, the selective loss of the adenylate cyclase inhibition together with an even increased stimulation of the enzyme by PGE1 suggests that there are two at least partially distinct regulatory sites involved in opposing hormonal regulations of adenylate cyclase activity, with that involved in hormonal inhibition being highly susceptible to inactivation by NEM."
https://openalex.org/W2074751102,"A synthetic heptapeptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of the poliovirus genome protein (VPg) has been linked to bovine serum albumin and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. These antibodies precipitate not only VPg but also at least two more virus-specific polypeptides. The smaller polypeptide, denoted P3–9 (12,000 daltons), has been mapped by Edman degradation and by fragmentation with cyanogen bromide and determined to be the N-terminal cleavage product of polypeptide P3-1b, a precursor to the RNA polymerase. P3–9 contains the sequence of the basic protein VPg (22 amino acids) at its C terminus. As predicted by the known RNA sequence of poliovirus, P3–9 also contains a hydrophobic region of 22 amino acids preceding VPg, an observation suggesting that P3–9 may be membrane-associated. This was confirmed by fractionation of infected cells in the presence or absence of detergent. We speculate that P3–9 may be the donor of VPg to RNA chains in the membrane-bound RNA replication complex."
https://openalex.org/W1991720374,"Orthopoxvirus DNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells within discrete foci designated as virosomes. We show that newly synthesized rabbit poxvirus (RPV) virosomal DNA consists predominantly of concatamers wherein unit length molecules are joined by fusion of two left (LL) or right (RR) ends, resulting in genomes aligned in alternating head-to-head and tail-to tail mirror image arrays. These concatameric molecules serve as the substrates from which unit length DNA molecules are excised during morphogenesis. We propose a mechanism by which internal deletions within these concatameric arrays prior to genome excision and packaging could create inverted terminal repeats and generate gene duplications."
https://openalex.org/W1994370397,"We have studied chemotaxis by individual Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae using strong, local gradients of the chemoattractant cyclic AMP. Gradients were provided by diffusion of cyclic AMP from a microneedle, which could be positioned at various points around the cell. Responses to changes in the gradient indicate how the cell is structurally organized for chemotactic movement. There is a polarity in the responsiveness of the surface to stimulation by cyclic AMP along the length of the amoeba. Furthermore, two aspects of chemotactic movement can be distinguished. The first response to cyclic AMP is a locally generated extension of a hyaline pseudopod from the region of the surface nearest the stimulus. The second response, is coordinated and separate from the first response. The coordination appears to depend on the nucleus or on the microtubule-organizing center."

https://openalex.org/W2091417035,"Glucocorticoids regulate the rate of transcription of integrated murine mammary tumor virus (MTV) genes in most clones of MTV-infected rat hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells. To determine whether hormonal regulation is mediated from flanking cellular sequences or rather from within the viral DNA, we analyzed the relative rates of transcription of MTV and adjacent HTC sequences in two lines of infected HTC cells, J2.15 and J2.17, each of which contains a single insertion of MTV DNA. In addition, we measured in uninfected HTC cells the transcriptional rates of the corresponding ""preinsertion fragments,"" which may be viewed as the equivalent sequences bearing deletions of MTV DNA; the two genomic segments into which integration occurred in the two lines are unrelated. Previous work showed that glucocorticoids induce the accumulation of MTV RNA in J2.17, whereas viral transcripts are not detected in J2.15, RNA pulse-labeling experiments indicate that glucocorticoids stimulate that rate of MTV gene transcription in J2.17 but not in J2.15; in contrast, no labeled RNA hybridizing to flanking sequences was detected either in the uninfected or in the infected cells. We conclude that the host site of integration cells. We conclude that the host site of integration of MTV need not be transcriptionally active or hormonally responsive to permit viral gene expression. Furthermore, these rate measurements indicate that glucocorticoid-stimulated MTV RNA synthesis in J2.17 does not reflect readthrough transcription from a regulated cellular promoter. This notion is independently supported by transcript mapping experiments showing that the 5' terminus of nuclear MTV RNA is at a site on MTV DNA approximately 1.2 kb downstream from the host-viral junction. Thus our data are consistent with the presence of a hormone-responsive element within the provirus."
https://openalex.org/W1523536119,"The preparation and purification of an active monoiodo derivative of apamin is described. Radiolabeled monoiodoapamin (2000 Ci/mmol) binds specifically to rat brain synaptosomes at 0 degrees C and pH 7.5 with a second order rate constant of association (ka = 2.6 x 10(7) M-1 s-1) and a first order rate constant of dissociation (kd = 3.8 x 10(-4) s-1). The maximal binding capacity is 12.5 fmol/mg of protein and the dissociation constant is 15-25 pM for the monoiodo derivative and 10 pM for the native toxin. The apamin receptor is destroyed by proteases suggesting that it is of a proteic nature. Neurotensin and its COOH-terminal partial sequences are the only molecules unrelated to apamin that are able to displace monoiodoapamin from its receptor at low concentrations. Half-displacement occurs at 170 nM neurotensin. This property is due to the presence in the COOH-terminal sequence of neurotensin of two contiguous arginine residues, a structure analogous to that of the apamin active site. The binding of monoiodoapamin to its receptor is sensitive to cations. Increasing K+ or Rb+ concentrations from 10 microM to 5 mM selectively enhances the binding by a factor of 1.8. Increasing the concentration of any cation from 1 to 100 mM completely inhibits iodoapamin binding. Both effects are due to a cation-induced modulation of the affinity of monoidoapamin for its receptor without any change of the maximal toxin binding capacity of synaptosomes. Guanidinium and molecules containing a guanidinium group are better inhibitors of iodoapamin binding than other inorganic cations or positively charged organic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1486153493,"Endonuclease V of bacteriophage T4 has been purified to physical homogeneity from T4D-infected Escherichia coli 1100. The enzyme, whose molecular weight is 16,000, possessed two distinct catalytic activities, a pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase and an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease. They acted on UV-irradiated poly(dA) . poly(dT) in a sequential manner; the glycosylase cleaved the N-glycosyl bond between the 5'-pyrimidine of a dimer and the corresponding sugar and then the endonuclease hydrolyzed a phosphodiester bond on the 3'-side of the apyrimidinic site. The 5'-termini thus generated were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase only after they had been subjected to direct photoreversal and then treated with alkaline phosphatase. By using two phage mutants, uvs-5 and uvs-13, it was shown that occurrence of an amber mutation in the denV gene caused a simultaneous loss of the two activities. Suppression of the mutation of uvs-5 rendered both activities partially active. When the mutation of uvs-13 was suppressed, a mutant form of enzyme that possessed only a glycosylase activity was produced. This suggests that there are two distinct domains in a single enzyme, each of which corresponds to one of the activities."
https://openalex.org/W2059400486,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the goat fetal (gamma), preadult (beta C) and adult (beta A) globin genes. In contrast to other globin genes expressed in different stages of development, these three genes are highly homologous (approximately 90%) in both their coding and noncoding regions. The only major difference between them results from elements inserted into their large introns: gamma contains a 247 bp insertion, beta A contains a 318 bp insertion, and beta C contains both a 252 bp insertion and a 60 bp deletion. Based on comparisons of these three genes to each other and to two goat globin pseudogenes, psi beta X and psi beta Z, we conclude that gamma, beta A and beta C have diverged relatively recently, and that the two gene pairs psi beta X - beta C and psi beta Z-beta A arose via a block duplication of an ancestral pseudogene-functional gene pair. Moreover, as opposed to the human fetal genes (G gamma and A gamma), the goat gamma gene appears to be a true beta-like gene that has fetal-specific function. The insertions in gamma, beta A and beta C contain sequence features characteristic of transposon-like elements, and appear to be represented in multiple copies throughout the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1503560455,"Human neutrophils incubated with phorbol myristate acetate oxidized hemoglobin within the intact erythrocyte by a mechanism dependent on cell-cell contact but independent of phagocytosis. Spectrophotometric examination of the erythrocyte lysates revealed that the major component formed was methemoglobin along with small amounts of a species with spectral characteristics similar to choleglobin. Methemoglobin formation was directly related to the neutrophil concentration and the time of incubation. The addition of superoxide dismutase or catalase modestly inhibited the formation of methemoglobin, while a combination of the enzymes provided the most dramatic protection. Methemoglobin of hydroxyl radical or hypochlorous acid scavengers. Apparently, either O2.- or H2O2 alone was capable of mediating methemoglobin formation in the intact erythrocyte. Maintenance of the intraerythrocytic hemoglobin in its oxygenated state or its derivatization to carbon monoxyhemoglobin markedly inhibited methemoglobin formation. Blockade of the anion channels in the intact erythrocyte with sulfonated stilbenes inhibited O2.- but not H2O2 from oxidizing intracellular hemoglobin. It appears that neutrophil-derived O2.- and H2O2 can cross the erythrocyte membrane through the anion channel or diffuse directly into the intracellular space and react with oxyhemoglobin or deoxyhemoglobin to form a mixture of hemoglobin oxidation products within the intact cell."

We cloned a functional CAD gene from Syrian hamster cells using a cosmid vector. Two independently isolated cosmids containing CAD genes have inserts 40 and 45 kb long. We introduced the cloned genes into CAD-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants by fusing them with protoplasts of Escherichia coli containing the cosmids. We also introduced the cloned genes into wild-type CHO cells by selecting cells that became resistant to high concentrations of PALA following protoplast fusion. The transformants of the mutant and wild-type CHO cells contain multiple active copies of the donated Syrian hamster CAD genes. The cloned genes in three independent transformants are integrated into host-cell chromosomes at single locations identified by in situ hybridization. In two of these transformants, the genes are located in one X chromosome or in a chromosome resembling the X. In the third case, the genes are located in a small metacentric or rearranged chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1531038433,"Equilibrium, stopped flow, and temperature-jump spectrophotometry have been used to identify processes in the unfolding of ferricytochrome c in acidic aqueous solutions. A relaxation occurring in approximately 100 microseconds involves perturbation of a spin-equilibrium between two folded conformers of the protein with methionine-80 coordinated or dissociated from the heme iron. The protein unfolds more slowly, in milliseconds, with dissociation and protonation of histidine-18. These two transitions appear cooperative in equilibrium measurements at low (0.01 M) ionic strength, but are separated at higher (0.10 M) ionic strength. They are resolved under both conditions in the dynamic measurements. The spin-equilibrium description permits a unified explanation of a number of properties of ferricytochrome c in acidic aqueous solutions."
https://openalex.org/W1513290991,"Confluent monolayer cultures of the differentiated kidney epithelial cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), have been used to study ion transport mechanisms involved in transepithelial transport. We have investigated the previously reported K+-stimulation of 22Na+ uptake by confluent monolayers of Na+ depleted cells (Rindler, M. J., Taub, M., and Saier, M. H., Jr. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11431-11439). This component of Na+ uptake was insensitive to ouabain and amiloride, but was strongly inhibited by furosemide or bumetanide. Ouabain-insensitive 86Rb+ uptake was also inhibitable by furosemide or bumetanide and stimulated by extracellular Na+. The synergistic effect of Na+ and 86Rb+ uptake and K+ on 22Na+ uptake was reflected by an increase in the apparent Vmax and a decrease in the apparent Km as the concentration of the other cation was increased. The extrapolated Km for either 86Rb+ or 22Na+ uptake in the absence of the other cation was 30 mM while the Km in the presence of a saturating concentration of the other cation was 9 mM. The absolute Vmax values for 22Na+ and 86Rb+ uptake suggest a cotransport system with a stoichiometry of 2Na+:3K+. However, because of the experimental design, the actual ratio may be closer to 1:1. Competition with, and stimulation by, a variety of unlabeled cations indicated that Na+ could be partially replaced by Li+, while K+ could be fully replaced by Rb+ and partially replaced by NH4+ and CS+. Uptake by this system was dependent upon cellular ATP. Reduction of intracellular ATP to 3% of normal abolished both K+-stimulated 22Na+ uptake and Na+-stimulated 86Rb+ uptake."

Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the M protein was synthesized at a normal rate, but was unstable compared to the other viral proteins. The M protein instability was independent of temperature and could account for part of the reduction in viral production by persistently infected cells. When a virus stock was grown in embryonated chicken eggs from viruses produced by persistently infected BHK cells, the M protein of this stock presented a restored stability in BHK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2157581345,"In an attempt to determine the mechanism (or mechanisms) by which vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) kills cells, products of VSV transcription were tested in a cell-free system for their capacity to inhibit transcription of SV40 DNA and plasmids containing adenovirus late promoter and adenovirus-associated RNA genes. VSV RNA transcripts and other RNAs were compared for their capacity to suppress transcription of these DNA templates by RNA polymerases and cofactors present in the HeLa-cell extract system. Relatively low concentrations of the plus-strand leader RNA made in vitro from the 3' end of the wild-type VSV genome were found to inhibit initiation of transcription catalyzed by both RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III. Polyadenylated VSV messengers and other natural and synthetic RNAs also caused some inhibitory effects on in vitro transcription from DNA templates, but only at extremely high concentrations. Compared with the wild-type plus-strand RNA leader, the leader RNA synthesized in vitro by defective-interfering VSV showed only limited capacity to inhibit RNA synthesis on adenovirus and SV40 DNA templates and only at concentrations at least 30 times greater than that of the wild-type leader. The existence of nucleotide sequences in wild-type leader RNA, not present in defective-interfering leader RNA, that could recognize and block promoters, polymerases or protein cofactors is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1571090114,"Escherichia coli endodeoxyribonuclease V acts at many sites of damage in duplex DNA, including apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, lesions induced by ultraviolet light which are not pyrimidine dimers, adducts of 7-bromomethylbenz[a]anthracene, and, as demonstrated earlier (Gates, F. T., and Linn, S. (1977a) J. Biol. Chem. 252. 1647-1653), it degrades uracil-containing duplex DNA most efficiently. The cleavage rate increases with increasing substitution of uracil for thymine in T5 DNA, with a replacement of one-eight of thymine generating the apparent maximum cleavage rate. However, the apparent reaction limit with DNA containing 3.8% of thymine replaced by uracil corresponds to cleavage at only 6% of the dUMP residues. Evidently, the enzyme recognizes some peculiarities of abnormal DNA structure, but not simply distortions, since some lesions, including pyrimidine dimers, are not substrates. Endonuclease V generates double strand breaks in a constant ratio to single strand nicks, regardless of the substrate. It degrades DNA processively, completing the digestion of one substrate molecule before proceeding to the next. The enzyme also appears to act cooperatively. Cleavage at methylbenz[a]anthracene adducts is usually or always 5' to the lesion. Endonuclease V seems well suited to act as a DNA repair enzyme, surveying the genome for structural distortions generated by lesions for which specific repair systems might not exist."
https://openalex.org/W1936985502,The hepatic binding protein which is responsible for receptor-mediated endocytosis of desialylated glycoproteins undergoes cell-cycle dependent modulation of its expression. Endocytosis of desialylated orosomucoid by hepatocytes isolated from regenerating liver following two-thirds hepatectomy is reduced by 80% and returns to normal when regeneration is substantially complete. This decrease in endocytotic activity is due to selective loss of cell-surface associated receptor during liver regeneration.

The established pig kidney cell line, LLC PK1, was used to study this feedback regulation. These cells possess a receptor for 1,25-(OH)2D3 with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.2 S. Scatchard analysis of 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding to cell cytosol yielded an apparent Kd of 0.12 nM and an Nmax of 26 fmol/mg of cytosol protein. LLC PK1 cells respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3 by changes in the metabolism of 25-OH-D3. When incubated with 25-OH-[3H]D3, homogenates of untreated cells did not produce detectable 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 or 24,25-(OH)2[3H]D3. However, after treatment of cell monolayers with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 8 h, homogenates converted substantial 25-OH-[3H]D2 substrate to 24,25-(OH)2[3H]D3. The appearance of this 24-hydroxylase activity in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 was time- and dose-dependent. Half-maximal levels of enzyme activity were achieved with 0.13 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3, a concentration almost identical to the Kd of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor. The stimulation of 24-hydroxylase activity was shown to be an induction event; treatment of monolayers with 13 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 for a 4-h pulse was sufficient to induce maximal activity assayed at h. The presence of the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, during the 4-h pulse abolished the induction of 24-hydroxylase activity. These results demonstrate for the first time the presence of both 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors and stimulation of 24-hydroxylase activity within the same established mammalian kidney cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1594584003,"Resonance Raman spectra are reported for oxidized ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum and for protein reconstituted with 34S2-, using 4579 A laser excitation. The spectra are of much higher quality than that previously reported, and the 34S shifts provide assignments of the Fe-S modes. After treatment with ferricyanide, the resonance Raman spectrum closely resembles that of the [3Fe-3S] protein, ferredoxin II from D. gigas; the 34S shifts aid in assignments of the [3Fe-3S] modes. The epr signal associated with the [3Fe-3S] cluster (g = 2.01) corresponds maximally to 0.80 spin/molecule. Anaerobic addition of excess sulfide to the reduced, ferricyanide-treated protein regenerates a [4Fe-4S]1+ epr spectrum, equivalent in intensity to the [3Fe-3S] signal. The ubiquitous occurrence of a g = 2.01 signal in preparations of [4Fe-4S] proteins can be attributed to variable amounts of [3Fe-3S] cluster generated by adventitious oxidation. The ready conversion of [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-3S] clusters in C. pasterianum raises the possibility that some [3Fe-3S] proteins may actually arise by oxidative damage of [4Fe-4S] proteins during aerobic isolation."
https://openalex.org/W1490821933,"The two protomers of the purified regulatory subunit from porcine cAMP-dependent protein kinase I have been shown to be covalently cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonding. Limited proteolysis which cleaves the polypeptide chain into two fragments demonstrated that the disulfide bonding was associated exclusively with the fragment that corresponded to the NH2-terminal region of the polypeptide chain. This NH2-terminal fragment accounted for approximately 15 to 20% of the molecule. The disulfide bonding was further characterized by alkylating the cysteines in the native regulatory subunit. Following oxidation with performic acid, each regulatory subunit contained 7 cysteic acid residues; however, under denaturing conditions, but without prior reduction, only 5 cysteine residues could be alkylated with iodoacetic acid. Following limited proteolysis, all five of these cysteines were associated with the larger COOH-terminal, cAMP binding domain. In contrast, if the denatured subunit was first reduced prior to alkylation, all 7 cysteine residues were alkylated. The 2 cysteines that were only accessible to alkylation after prior reduction were both associated with the NH2-terminal end of the polypeptide chain ultimately with a 5,400 peptide. Alkylation of the isolated, denatured NH2-terminal domain with iodoacetic acid resulted in no covalent modification unless the fragment was first reduced with dithiothreitol. The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains were shown to be linked by a region of the polypeptide chain that is rich in both proline and arginine. It is the arginine-rich site that is readily prone to proteolytic cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1555927940,"It was previously shown that alkaline borohydride treatment of human midcycle cervical mucin releases a heterogeneous population of reduced neutral, sialylated, and sulfated oligosaccharides (Yurewicz, E. C., and Moghissi, K. S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11895-11905). Three major neutral oligosaccharides were isolated with approximate compositions of Fuc:Gal:GlcNAc:N-acetylgalactosaminitol (GalNAcol) = 0:2:1:1 (A1), 1:2:1:1 (A2), and 2:2:1:1 (A3). They comprised roughly 21%, 13%, and 8% of human cervical mucin oligosaccharide chains, respectively. In the present report, each was analyzed by periodate oxidation, methylation, and sequential degradation with glycosidases. A1 was shown to contain more than one component, but structural analyses clearly demonstrated the presence of one predominant (75%) tetrasaccharide. The proposed structure, Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-6(Gal beta 1-3)GalNAcol, has previously been found in human gastric, submaxillary, and ovarian cyst mucins in their carbohydrate-to-protein linkage regions. beta-Galactosidase from Aspergillus niger selectively cleaved the Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc linkage in the intact tetrasaccharide. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the Gal beta 1-3GalNAcol linkage required prior removal of the Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-unit attached to 0-6 of GalNAcol. The data for A2 indicated a mixture of two oligosaccharides, Gal beta 1-4,3(Fuc alpha 1-3,4)GlcNAc beta 1-6(Gal beta 1-3)GalNacol and Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-4GlcNac beta 1-6(Gal beta 1-3)-GalNacol, in an approximate molar ratio of 3 to 4:1, respectively. Two structures are consistent with the data obtained for A3: Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-4,3(Fuc alpha 1-3,4)GlcNAc beta 1-6(Gal beta 1-3)GalNAcol and/or Gal beta 1-4,3(Fuc alpha 1-3,4)GlcNac beta 1-6(Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3)GalNacol. The results indicate that A1 represents the core tetrasaccharide of the larger human cervical mucin oligosaccharides A2 and A3."
https://openalex.org/W1538090677,"The binding of the substrates, ATP and ribose-5-P, and the most effective inhibitor, ADP, to phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium was characterized using equilibrium dialysis of these compounds labeled with 32P. In the absence of ribose-5-P, ATP, ADP, and the ATP analogue alpha,beta-methylene ATP each bind cooperatively with half-saturation at 50 to 90 microM and Hill coefficients of 1.5 to 2. We propose that all three compounds bind at the same set of sites, which are presumably the active sites. When ribose-5-P was added, methylene ATP and ADP binding at these sites became tighter (Kd approximately 3 to 6 microM at 10 mM ribose-5-P) and lost its cooperativity. In the presence of ribose-5-P, ADP, but not methylene ATP, bound to a second site with half-saturation at approximately 150 microM and a Hill coefficient greater than 3. This result confirms the existence of an allosteric ADP site, which was previously postulated from kinetic studies (Switzer, R. L., and Sogin, D. C. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1063-1073). Binding of ribose-5-P could not be detected in the absence of nucleotides, but it was readily measured in their presence. The apparent Kd of ribose-5-P varied from greater than 1 mM to approximately 5 microM as the concentration of either ADP or methylene ATP was increased from 0 to 2 mM. Inhibition of the enzyme by action of ADP at both active and allosteric sites could be observed kinetically."
https://openalex.org/W2121815020,"The promotor function of the 3' and 5' half tRNA sequences in the yeast tRNA-Leu3 gene has been studied by in vitro transcription in Xenopus laevis germinal vesicle (GV) extracts. Truncation of the DNA template within the tRNA intervening sequence by Hpa I abolishes transcription. However, separation of the tRNA gene halves by insertion of a 300 bp DNA fragment at the Hpa I site does not affect the promoter efficiency. Further, the complete sequence of the 3' half of the tRNA is not necessary for promoter function, because removal of the 3' half of the gene by cleavage with Pvu II, within the DNA inserted at the Hpa I site, does not inhibit transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1541460309,"Intact human neutrophils, incubated with the soluble stimulant phorbol myristate acetate, discharge lysosomal components, generate oxygen metabolites, and transform exogenous 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, prostaglandin E2, and prostaglandin F2 alpha as assessed by thin layer radiochromatography. Neutrophils alone were incapable of transforming the prostaglandins. The addition of catalase or the myeloperoxidase inhibitor, azide, protected all three prostaglandins from the phorbol-stimulated neutrophils. Neither superoxide dismutase, heat-inactivated catalase, nor albumin had any inhibitory effect in this system. A model system consisting of glucose-glucose oxidase, as a source of H2O2, purified myeloperoxidase, and chloride was also able to transform the prostaglandins in an identical fashion. Neither glucose-glucose oxidase alone nor glucose-glucose oxidase and myeloperoxidase under chloride-free conditions were able to mediate this transformation. Thus, it appears that intact human neutrophils can transform prostaglandins by a mechanism dependent on H2O2, the lysosomal enzyme myeloperoxidase, and chloride. Given the importance of prostaglandins in regulating immune function, neutrophil-dependent prostaglandin transformation could play a novel role in modulating the inflammatory response."

The activities of the two enzymes in the complex are strongly inhibited by the G-actin and tubulin (both in the subunit-dissociated and in the polymeric form); F-actin was less inhibitory, while myosin and actomyosin were without any effect. Gel filtration experiments revealed a complex formation between poly(A) polymerase/endoribonuclease IV and G-actin or tubulin at an approximately 1:1 molar ratio. The homogeneous poly(A) polymerase was determined to be maximally inhibited by a 5-fold excess of G-actin and by less than a 2-fold excess of tubulin dimer, if calculated on the molecular basis. The inhibitory potency of G-actin on poly(A) polymerase was reduced after co-incubation with DNase I or phalloidin and that of tubulin by colchicine. It is suggested that actin and/or tubulin is involved also in regulation of poly(A) metabolism in intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W1992480316,"Five single base pair mutations that increase expression of the tnpA (transposase) gene of the Tn3 transposon approximately 30-fold, but which still allow the gene to be regulated, have been isolated by using a generally applicable procedure that involves distally linked lac gene fusions. The mutations, which are all located in a region controlling initiation of translation of the tnpA gene, do not affect normal repression of tnpA by the tnpR gene product, and yield up to a 9000-fold increase in tnpA protein production when combined with a tnpR mutation and placed on a high copy number plasmid. The mutation yielding the highest expression level was separated from the fused lac gene segment by homologous recombination and was found to increase the rate of transposition without altering the nature of the transposition product; in cells defective in both the E. coli recA gene and the tnpR gene of tn3, cointegrate transposition-intermediate structures occur with the overproducing--as well as with the wild-type--tnpA gene. In the presence of a functional Tn3 tnpR gene or the related transposon delta gamma, such cointegrate structures are resolved into the final products of transposition."
https://openalex.org/W1505638432,"Synthetic fragments of the membrane channel-forming polypeptide, alamethicin, have been labeled with a fluorescent 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) group at the ${NH}_2$-terminal. Seventeen and 13-residue fluorescent peptide esters have been shown to translocate divalent cations in unilamellar liposomes and uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver mitochondria. The corresponding peptide acids also exhibit membrane-modifying activity, whereas the shorter fragments are inactive. Aggregation of fluorescent peptides in aqueous solutions leads to a marked blue shift and enhancement of the dansyl group emission spectrum. Critical micelle concentrations may be determined for the association of peptides. The longer peptides aggregate at lower concentrations than the short peptides, with the ease of aggregation following a trend similar to that for functional activity. The peptide acids aggregate only in media of high ionic strength. The peptide ester aggregates are stabilized by increasing salt concentration and dissociated by urea, suggestive of hydrophobic stabilization of the aggregates. The enthalpy of association for the 10- and 17-residue peptide esters is estimated to be between -1 and -3 kcal ${mol}^{-1}$ of monomer. The aqueous phase aggregation of channel-forming peptides at low concentrations suggests that preformed aggregates may be inserted into the membrane to constitute functional channels."
https://openalex.org/W80569435,"We have designed and synthesized a model pentadecapeptide predicted to have the essential sequence information needed to form a stable and enzymatically active noncovalent complex with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease S-protein. The model peptide sequence, based on the conformational approach of simplifying the native sequence in a manner consistent with retention of essential noncovalent contacts and of secondary structure features, contained alanine at all positions except for Glu 2, Lys 7, Phe 8, Arg 10, His 12, and Met 13. The peptide was synthesized by the Merrifield solid phase method. The circular dichroism spectra of the purified model peptide in water and trifluoroethanol indicated a tendency to form an alpha-helical structure similar to that found for native S-peptide. The model peptide formed a stable complex with ribonuclease S-protein. With 12-fold excess of the peptide, the complex exhibited 36% of the specific activity of fully native ribonuclease S against the substrate cyclic cytidine 2':3'-monophosphate at pH 7.15. The dissociation constant of the model peptide for S-protein was found to be 1.1 x 10(-6) M, compared with 0.1 x 10(-6) M for native S-peptide. Crystals grown of the model peptide-S-protein complex were found to be isomorphous with those of native complex. The activity, stability, and structural integrity of the model complex verify the deductions made about essential sequence information in the NH2-terminal region of ribonuclease. Further, the results emphasize the general usefulness of the conformational approach in designing simplified sequences for other peptides and proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1596190693,Abstract A single locus (designated c-fes) in the human genome which exhibits homology to the transformation-specific onc gene (v-fes) of Snyder-Theilen feline sarcoma virus was identified by the Southern blot technique. Recombinant clones containing 16- to 18-kilobase inserts of human DNA including the c-fes locus were constructed. Restriction endonuclease mapping of these clones verified their identity with native human c-fes and demonstrated the presence of at least two sequences in human c-fes interrupting v-fes-homologous regions. The v-fes-homologous locus in the human genome spans about 4 kilobases. The 5'-3' orientation of the c-fes clones with respect to feline sarcoma virus proviral DNA was determined. The region of the human genome that is homologous to v-fes is proximal to the highly reiterated human Alu sequence but not to the highly reiterated human alphoid sequence.
https://openalex.org/W2994182533,"Adenylate cyclase and a number of carbohydrate transport systems are subject to regulation by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. These sensitive carbohydrate transport systems are desensitized to regulation by the phosphotransferase system, and adenylate cyclase is deactivated when cells are grown in medium containing cyclic AMP. These effects are specific for cyclic AMP and are potentiated by the genetic loss of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. Inclusion in the growth medium of an inducer of a sensitive transport system also promotes desensitization of that particular transport system. Inducer-promoted desensitization is specific for the particular target transport system, while cyclic AMP-promoted desensitization is general and affects several systems. Desensitization of the permeases to regulation, and inactivation of adenylate cyclase, are slow processes which are blocked by chloramphenicol and are therefore presumably dependent on protein synthesis. Several sugar substrates of the phosphotransferase system are capable of regulating the sensitive carbohydrate transport systems. The evidence suggests that desensitization to this regulation does not result from a direct effect on the functioning of Enzyme I, a small heat-stable protein of the phosphotransferase system, HPr, or an Enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system, but specifically uncouples the permease systems from regulation."

Differences between the tertiary structures of the native and trypsin-modified hormones have been demonstrated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Despite these conformational differences, the biological properties of intact hormone and its modified form appeared to be very similar, as tested by two receptor-binding assays, radioimmunoassay, and the rat tibia test."
https://openalex.org/W1545595855,"A modified cytochrome c peroxidase was prepared by reconstituting apocytochrome c peroxidase with protoheme in which both heme propionic acid groups were converted to the methyl ester derivatives. The modified enzyme reacted with hydrogen peroxide with a rate constant of (1.3 +/- 0.2) x 10(7) M-1 s-1, which is 28% that of the native enzyme. The reaction between the modified enzyme and hydrogen peroxide was pH-dependent with an apparent pK of 5.1 +/- 0.1 compared to a value of 5.4 +/- 0.1 for the native enzyme. These observations support the conclusion that the apparent ionization near pH 5.4, which influences the hydrogen peroxide-cytochrome c peroxidase reaction is not due to the ionization of the propionate side chains of the heme group in the native enzyme. A second apparent ionization, with pK of 6.1 +/- 0.1, influences the spectrum of the modified enzyme which changes from a high spin type at low pH to a low spin type at high pH."
https://openalex.org/W1571238585,"Oxidized Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase (ferrocytochrome c-551:oxidoreductase; EC 1.9.3.2), digested with subtilisin in the absence and presence of KCN, produces discrete, high molecular weight fragments. The presence of KCN alters the rate of this fragmentation but does not change the nature of the fragments. When digested in the absence of KCN, the oxidase gives a major product (A) which is enzymatically active and has an apparent Mr = 58,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the presence of KCN, the major product (B) has Mr = 48,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but with gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography it has an apparent Mr = 92,000. This implies that product B is dimeric, as is the parent enzyme which has Mr = 110,000 by high performance liquid chromatography. Absorption spectra of product B, isolated by gel filtration, show that it contains only the heme d1 moiety. The digestion time course indicates that the rate at which several minor products are formed is also dependent on the absence or presence of KCN. These observations suggest that the binding of KCN to the heme centers induces a conformational change in the enzyme so that the heme c-containing portion of the protein, which is at one end of the intact enzyme, can be removed without disrupting the integrity of the heme d1-containing portion."

We report the growth of human fibroblasts on a microcarrier bead system which obviates the limitation of cell adherence in such determinations. This system has been applied to the reversible interaction of low density lipoproteins (LDL) with the fibroblast membrane receptors. Of the 125I-LDL specifically bound to filtered cells, 52.2 +/- 9.8% was reversibly bound. This reversible LDL-cell binding occurred in less than 1 h at 37 degrees C, was specific for LDL, and occurred without significant 125I-LDL degradation. Using these techniques, it is now possible to obtain direct measurement and characterization of lipoprotein-receptor interactions in adherent cell lines of normal subjects and patients with dyslipoproteinemia."
